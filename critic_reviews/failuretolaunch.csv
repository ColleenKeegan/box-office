Comments Failure to Launch Matthew McConaugheys last hit How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days (2003) was one of those comedies in which the lovers spend the entire movie deceiving each other then fall into each others arms. This dud is even more contrived McConaughey still lives with his parents at age 35 so mom (Kathy Bates) and dad (sportscaster Terry Bradshaw) hire a counselor (Sarah Jessica Parker) who specializes in romancing guys until they leave the nest. (What keeps them from moving back in after she ends the charade isnt explained.) The movies notion of humor is exemplified by Bradshaws extended nude scene which might be termed ""roughing the viewer."" Tom Dey directed; with Zooey Deschanel providing occasional relief as Parkers acrid roommate. PG-13 92 min. By J.R.

Sarah Jessica Parker plays Paula a consultant hired by the parents of 35-year-old Tripp (McConaughey) to persuade him to move out of the family home via a complicated dating procedure this apparently being easier than just telling him to sling his hook. Needless to say Paula falls for Tripp but the romance is even less compelling than Tripps extreme sporting jaunts with his friends in which he has lengthy run-ins with a series of angry animals. One can only surmise that this is intended as the comic element; in fact the peripheral female characters (Kathy Bates as Tripps mother Zooey Deschanel as Paulas flatmate) are the only ones that come close to providing laughs and theyre still off-track. Add to this a confused moral message and its clear that as its title inadvertently suggests this romantic comedy never gets off the ground.

Hire a charming woman to fall for him. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Failure to Launch Romantic Comedy. Starring Sarah Jessica Parker Matthew McConaughey Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates. Directed by Tom Dey. (PG-13. 97 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It would be a lot easier to sound smart talking about whats wrong with ""Failure to Launch"" than whats right about it. The bad things can be pointed out and identified (one too many silly interludes involving animals some clumsy turns of plot some fake sincere moments etc.) while the good things are intangible debatable and can all be placed under the vague category of charm. Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker look good in this movie separately and together. They enjoy themselves or create that illusion and they give generous performances in the sense that shot by shot they go out of their way to project thought and emotion in concentrated doses. To talk about it this sounds like the most obvious thing imaginable but in the actual doing of it the successful landing of a screen personality takes skill a conscious act of will and a personality worth conveying. These are qualities and abilities not always present in modern actors and its what we respond to in classic stars such as Gable and Claudette Colbert. ""Failure to Launch"" isnt ""It Happened One Night"" or even close but McConaughey and Parker have that extra something. An intelligent case could be made for romantic comedy as the most interesting of genres. Its certainly the most restrictive. All romantic comedies have to end in pretty much the same way or else they cease to be romantic comedies and become something else -- ""Romeo and Juliet"" for example. Its a genre that offers no mystery or suspense just spectacle How will it happen? The details vary from era to era even from decade to decade and in those details we can read the development of a culture. Yet one thing has remained consistent since the days of Gloria Swanson through today There has to be people in it that audiences want to look at. A good suspense drama can sustain lackluster leads but a romantic is all about whos in it. McConaughey who plays Tripp -- a 35-year-old man who still lives with his parents -- mixes a superficial surface with an essence that suggests hidden depths of iciness stubbornness character strength and intelligence. He can play the beer drinking nonsense-talking good ol boy and the next minute in close-up let you know that theres more to this good ol boy than you thought or maybe more to good ol boys in general than you ever expected. Thats Tripp a complicated man who lives a life without focus -- selling boats for a living living out of an upstairs bedroom and letting the years pile up. Parker plays Paula a woman who has set up a business in which she romances guys who are still living with their parents. She gives them confidence and persuades them ultimately to move out. Getting a guy to like her is easy she tells Tripps parents. ""I look nice find out what he likes and pretend to like it too."" ""Failure to Launch"" is that familiar story the love affair that begins under false pretenses. But screenwriters Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember come up with some unexpected moves unseen complications and comedy bits a few ridiculous (otherwise harmless animals keep biting Tripp for some reason) a few unnecessarily strenuous but some genuinely funny. They also jazz things up by inserting that staple of musical comedy -- the funny couple whose romantic development serves as an untroubled counterpoint to the main couple. All the performances are pitched at a generous level. Everyones vivid including Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw as Tripps overwhelmed parents and when that happens its time to credit the director. Zooey Deschanel an actress with her own distinct rhythms is different here than in her other films just as off-center and arresting as ever but in a new less dreamy and more caustic way. Parker though is the heart of the movie and anyone who doesnt especially like her would have little reason to especially like ""Failure to Launch."" At its best this is a showcase for her sensitive intelligence her watchfulness and her way of thinking and reacting. ""The Family Stone"" did nothing for Parker but ""Failure to Launch"" makes a strong case for life after ""Sex and the City."" -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Failure to Launch"" with Matthew McConaughey Sarah Jessica Parker Zooey Deschanel Justin Bartha Bradley Cooper Terry Bradshaw Kathy Bates. Directed by Tom Dey from a screenplay by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember. 97 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual content partial nudity and language. Several theaters. For those who think that the life of a movie critic is a jolly romp through art and popcorn consider this In order to write this review I had to spend a fair amount of time staring at the unclothed nether regions of Terry Bradshaw. Bradshaw is a man of many accomplishments but nude modeling does not appear to be one of them. Im not asking for your sympathy dear readers. Watching this sort of thing is my job and Ive recovered nicely. You however would be paying for the privilege. If youre wondering why Bradshaw has a nude scene in a Matthew McConaughey/Sarah Jessica Parker romantic comedy -- well Im still wondering too. The filmmakers seem to have tossed it in for no particular reason sort of like a gift-with-purchase. ""Failure to Launch"" despite a charming cast and a potentially funny premise is a romantic comedy without fizz. The makers seem to have little faith in their product. The movie keeps cutting away from the main characters with pointless diversions like the Bradshaw scene or a subplot in which Zooey Deschanel endlessly plots to kill a bird. Its as if director Tom Dey is just trying to fill up the running time. At 97 minutes it feels very long. Too bad because McConaughey and Parker look adorable together. Hes Tripp a 35-year-old boat salesman who still lives happily at home with his parents (Bradshaw Kathy Bates); shes Paula a ""consultant"" secretly hired by said parents to get him out of the house. Tripp and his buddies (who have names like Demo and Ace) all seem to still live at home and are amusingly defensive about it and theres definitely the grain of a funny idea here. But the story makes no sense -- why do Tripps parents treat him so indulgently (Mom makes daily pancake breakfasts that look so heavenly I was tempted to move in myself) if they want him out? Why dont they just talk to him about it? McConaughey meanders through with his laconic I-know-Im-cute charm and Parker squeals and giggles nicely. Its no stretch to see these two pairing up. But would it have been so hard to create a decent screenplay? Apparently so. ""Failure to Launch"" is yet another disposable romantic comedy made with little thought or skill. The cast deserves better just as Bradshaw deserves pants. Please.

And whats not to laugh at? What movie goer hasnt secretly wanted to take a bite out of the guy for reasons ignoble or not? His latest incitement to violence (or whatever) is Trip a commitment-phobic 35-year-old whose ""failure to launch"" means hes still living with his parents in their tidy suburban home enjoying Moms breakfasts snarfing Dads chips. Trip is exactly the sort of character McConaughey has played best since Dazed and Confused the cocksuredly charming uberslacker. Failure to Launch mixes it up by casting Sarah Jessica Parker slackerdoms diametric opposite as Paula the unlikely love interest. Paulas been hired by Trips parents -- a giddy Kathy Bates and an ursine Terry Bradshaw or vice versa -- to seduce Trip on the theory his newfound ardor will inspire him to grow up and leave the nest. Nice hypothesis. As is often the case in contemporary romantic comedies Trips entanglement with Paula is based on a lie and likely to backfire explosively which it does inviting viewers to question the wisdom of this matchup which you will. Appealing as they are in their roles McConaughey and Parker ignite few sparks together. The romantic portion of this romantic comedy is a pyrotechnic dud. But its failure to launch doesnt kill the movie because the comical part -- the part with the assaulting fauna -- is eccentric knockabout fun spattered with outlandish setups and amicably offbeat supporting players who reach out and steal the show. Director Tom Dey (Showtime Shanghai Noon) and screenwriters Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember hand it to them forking over ample screen time and idiosyncratic one-liners that make the leads superfluous. So forget Trip and Paula. Feast your eyes on their dorky friends sweet-dork Ace played by accomplished scene felon Justin Bartha (who swiped National Treasure from Nicolas Cage); philosopher-sage-dork Demo played by mismanaged character actor Bradley Cooper (the star chef on Foxs swiftly canceled Kitchen Confidential); and goth-dork Kit played by the dusky and intriguing Zooey Deschanel who carries the films most maliciously playful moments when she tries to buy a gun to kill a mockingbird. Rest assured -- the songbird lives with payback. This is a film dont forget in which Mother Nature plays the aggrieved party in one mans refusal to mature. ""Your life is fundamentally at odds with the natural world. Therefore nature rejects you"" observes Demo. Trip has just survived a run-in with the irked chuckwalla so he might be receptive to change. But is he? Will he? Does he submit to the forces of nature or will he find himself mauled by prairie dogs? The less generous urges of my lizard brain hoped for one more excerpt from ""When Animals Attack"" but in the end there was something scarier that sequence in every light comedy (youve seen it you know it) when one half of the romantic equation says ""we need to talk"" and the other half submits under duress. I will not describe the conversation or the duress but I will say this No one gets bitten. I think. Todays Deals KitchenAid Small Kitchen Appliances at eBay Up to 51% off +...

In this minor but enjoyable date flick starring Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker dysfunction may be a problem but its not of a physical nature. Instead McConaugheys 35-year-old Tripp still lives with his folks. The phenomenon of adult children living with their folks has been flogged in numerous newspaper and magazine articles. Often they return to the nest because they cant afford to live on their own. ""Failure to Launch"" establishes early on that Tripp and friends Ace (Justin Bartha) and Demo (Bradley Cooper) are freeloaders by choice. ""In America were shunned for our lifestyle"" they jokingly say all the way to the beach the woods the paintball field. And really why move? Tripps digs approach four-star. His maid service includes meals snacks ironed laundry. He sells sailboats down by the seashore. Buddies abound. When the woman hes dating gets ""that look"" he takes her home. Admitting he shacks up with his parents isnt humiliating its a surefire strategy. Parental interruptus puts the brakes on lasting romance. Football Hall of Famer Terry Bradshaw and Kathy Bates play Tripps folks. They complain about their son the squatter as only enablers can. Then the couple rediscover their friskiness after hiring a professional consultant to lure their son from the nest. When Tripps gotta go hes gotta go. Granted consultant Paula (Parker) has chosen a fairly odd profession. After all the job requires the foxy whip-smart gal feign interest and sexual attraction in a slew of loafers and losers. (Isnt there a name for that?) Typically shes efficient. In Tripp she meets her match. Like ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Wedding Crashers"" ""Failure to Launch"" reminds us that Hollywood is set on making romantic-comedy counterparts to the chick flick. Written by Tom Astle and Matt Ember ""Failure"" is engineered to bring that elusive demo of young fellas into the theater - with their dates. Manly yes but shell like it too. ""Failure"" is rife with fantasies about relationships. Not just the ones that address the dance between Martians and Venusians. There are also revelations about how guys might (or should) feel about their pals their parents and love lost. For ""Failure"" to succeed Tripp needs to have something deeper roiling beneath his slacker surface. And McConaughey so wide awake onscreen is coiled and at ease at once. He and Parker play and argue well - both skills being staples of romantic comedies. Two appealing leads cant hurt but in his first rom-com outing director Tom Dey (""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Showtime"") taps his entire ensembles enveloping chemistry.

"Parker is luminous in the clever Launch - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Parker is luminous in the clever Launch By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 10 2006 There are a lot of ways for a man to scare off an interested woman. One might be to say Babe this isnt working for me."" Another is to stop calling her. Meaner Ill admit but it works. Tripp the tanned Casanova Matthew McConaughey plays in Failure to Launch"" tries another tack. When things get too close with a potential girlfriend he takes her home to meet his parents.Lest you get carried away by the promise of romance in that gesture Tripps parents are also his roommates.Still the hilarity in this sunny movie comes from a twist in the plot that occurs not long after he meets Paula a more-than-meets-the-eye special needs"" consultant whom Sarah Jessica Parker plays with superhuman breeziness. She and Tripp have a lovely meeting in a Maryland furniture store where they recline in Barcaloungers and make a date for dinner.For about six years Tripps mother Sue (Kathy Bates) has been cooking his meals washing and folding his laundry making his bed and tossing him a snack on his way out to his job as a boat salesman. She even vacuums the sinfully upscale bachelor pad that is his only-in-the-movies bedroom. Written by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember and directed by Tom Dey the movie makes sure we know early on that Sue and her husband Al (Terry Bradshaw) are tired of pampering their 35-year-old son. At a cookout they discover how some friends recently got rid of their kid. They hired Paula.Time magazine covers entire swaths of Newsweek and half a dozen morning-news segments have covered men like Tripp to death. Time even popularized the term twixters"" to describe them a word so stupid that it should have inspired adult moochers to leave mom and dads as a matter of embarrassment killing the trend. Sue and Als determination to drive Tripp from their home and Paulas arrival enliven this TV setup.Failure to Launch"" is an actual situation comedy thats cleverly post-sitcom. The television show would have been all about a dude who moves in with his parents. Period. The movie holds on to the parents the dude and his buddies a nature-boy slacker (Bradley Cooper) and a lovable techie (Justin Bartha) neither of whom have anything in common with Tripp except that they live with their folks too. But the movie is surprisingly nimble and emotionally honest with particular respect to Sue whos ambivalent about wanting Tripp to leave for touching reasons.The movie brings to mind the more polite parts of Wedding Crashers."" Failure to Launch"" while totally exuberant and appealingly made is not nearly as randy. The camera does find it impossible though to resist gaping at McConaugheys bare chest or open shirts. The man is sure to come back as a muscled-up well-oiled peacock in his next life. (Incidentally -- and ill advisedly -- wildlife is employed to attack Tripp out of his comfy living arrangement. Please dont ask.)In any case the film is also surprisingly well cast. Who knew for instance that Terry Bradshaw could be as goofy and affectionate with Kathy Bates as he is with James Brown and Howie Long on Fox NFL Sunday""? The wonderfully dour Zooey Deschanel has no business playing Parkers best pal and housemate Kit. (How are these two friends exactly?) But it doesnt matter; she bends the implausibility to her deadpan will making the most of a belabored plotline involving a mockingbird that needs killing.If theres a real problem with Failure to Launch"" its Paulas job which at moments forces her into situations that play a lot like prostitution. But Parker glides through them like well a professional. Romantic comedies are better with her in them. Sex and the City"" has prepared her for any type of man and every brand of romantic contrivance. Shes snappy smart and on this occasion luminous too. For a McConaughey movie this is unusual; shes the rare actor not upstaged by the numerous shots of his cleavage.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew McConaughey fall in love in the misbegotten Failure to Launch. Paramount Pictures This would-be romantic comedy is neither. The premise is misbegotten the chemistry non-existent and the dialogue leaden. Did we mention how tediously the plot unfolds? The billboards that show Sarah Jessica Parker forcing a smile so large she looks like a jack-o-lantern and pushing a smarmy-looking Matthew McConaughey capture the stilted nature of this dud. Dont let their spiffy clothes or attempt at a humorous pose fool you. This is not a viable date movie or a guilty-pleasure chick flick. Its not worth checking out even if you are an insomniac and its airing on late-night cable. About the movieFailure to Launch Stars Matthew McConaughey Sarah Jessica Parker Kathy Bates Terry Bradshaw Zooey Deschanel Director Tom Dey Distributor Paramount Rating PG-13 for sexual content partial nudity and language Running time 1 hour 36 minutes Opens Friday nationwide McConaughey has never been less appealing as a 35-year-old commitment-phobe. He lives with his parents (Kathy Bates and Terry Bradshaw) and uses this to scare off women who want to get too close. His mother seems to simultaneously long for him to leave while coddling him with big breakfasts and freshly ironed laundry. Her character is as muddled as much of the movie is. For that matter so are most of the film roles McConaughey chooses. Parkers character has made it her job to push men out of the nest by feigning interest in them. The premise seems flawed. Are there that many middle-aged men living with Mom and Dad for her to make a viable career out of luring them out? In this case she falls for her client and he for her and of course this leads to no end of trouble. Has no other poor schmuck fallen for her before given that her modus operandi is to pretend to be the guys girlfriend? Through romance her logic goes the guy will want to move into his own place. But once he does does she simply disappear? That part is never explained. And you cant help but wonder about parents who would be forced to resort to such a ploy particularly when their son has suffered a tragedy as theirs has. But all this is more analysis than this dismal movie is worth. Failure to Launch simply never gets off the ground.

"Failure to Launch Floats Many a Boat washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Failure to Launch Floats Many a Boat Sarah Jessica Parker is a ""professional girlfriend"" hired to get Matthew McConaugheys aging slacker to grow up in ""Failure to Launch."" (Frank Masi) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 10 2006 Karma or coincidence? After months of brilliant evasion I was trapped into writing one of those little preview box things for the Sunday paper (tip to journalism students Never look a news aide in the eye); on the same exact day just a few hours after my ordeal I saw ""Failure to Launch."" The common denominator is the great Viennese American director Billy Wilder he of ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"" among many other classics. I wrote my blurb (its soooo unfair) about the AFIs upcoming Billy Wilder Centennial Retrospective and then saw ""Failure to Launch"" which turns out to be the only American comedy in a long time that could be called Wilderan in its concept and execution. Screenwriters Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember abetted by director Tom Dey take off from a situation that is archetypally Wilderan based on the astringent perception that the human species is universally eternally perdurably corrupt and will always act in sneaky mendacious self-aggrandizing ways when the chance arises. Wilder loved sin; he loved lies duplicity the clammy helplessness of the nominal moral man before an all-too-great temptation -- and the later resolve somehow desperately to make it all right. Thats exactly the conceit of ""Failure to Launch"" and its why the movie is one of the best American films in months and months and the best comedy since I dont know when. It even makes you sorta kinda like Matthew McConaughey and if thats not the miracle of Morgans Creek I dont know what is. The film takes off from the slightly sordid reality that all too many young men of the bourgeoisie -- bright reasonably prosperous and also well pleased by the indulgences of liberal parents (Want to have the little date spend the night? No problem) -- have no incentive to leave home and their parents who wanting to be loved more than they want to be respected lack the guts to kick them out. So it is with Tripp (McConaughey) a beautiful 35-year-old boy-man a Peter Pan whod wear diapers and let Ma do the changing if he could. He brokers yachts for a nice if not overtaxed livelihood (the setting is an amorphous coastal area composed of bits of Maryland New Orleans and Alabama) hangs out with his loser buds gets enough girly action to keep from turning into a suicide bomber and drives a Porsche. But he lives in the same room hes lived in for 34 years and his high school trophies are still gathering dust on the shelves. Mom Sue (Kathy Bates good-natured and shlumpy) vacuums his floor makes his bed does his laundry and cooks pancakes for breakfast. She must think hes the Beaver and shes June Cleaver. Meanwhile his dad Al (amiable Terry Bradshaw less mobile than when he was with the Steelers less hysterical than when hes on ""Fox NFL Sunday"") just smiles amiably and feeds the fish while deciding which crewneck to wear with which plaid. Later -- Terry with four Super Bowl rings did you need to do this? -- he shows a little much of himself. Cant wait to see Howie and the guys grind him up in the fall. What Sue and Al need is a professional. They find one in Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker in her best movie role) a specialist in emptying nests. Shes what you might call the quintessential GFE -- girlfriend experience for those not in a certain know -- who contrives a meeting with Mr. Forlorn gets him to fall in love with her pumps up his self-esteem and confidence and gets him to move out. Her only rule for this type of exchanges is No sex please Im not sluttish. But she really is a non-sexual prostitute which is something like being a non-alcoholic beer. Whats the point? Thus the older folks hire her. Thus she sweeps into Tripps life and her view of love is both shrewd and cynical based on sound psychological principles. She so knows guys. Cry against his manly shoulder when your fake dog dies a fake death. Reach out for his strength and maybe hell actually develop some strength. Let him teach you something and maybe hell learn it first. Get along with his buddies even though theyre arrested morons. Shes used to success She gets ""the client"" to follow her to the ends of the Earth or more to the point out the front door. Its unstated that once hes fled the coop she dumps him. On this simple sturdy frame the writers work all kind of comic riffs. Of course Tripps two buddies -- Justin Bartha and Bradley Cooper -- try to be loyal to him for at least four and possibly as long as seven seconds and then sell him down the river in order to get small benefits for themselves. Everybody in fact sells everybody out and poor Tripp is swatted this way and that as all kinds of hostilities manifest themselves in nominal good deeds. (Ever notice how every deep screwing begins with the words ""This is for your own good""? Well so have the filmmakers.) Then cue mutt stage left that dog from hell love. Tripp falls for Paula and she for him to the horror of her snarly roommate Kit (Zooey Deschanel) who is (literally) trying to kill a mockingbird in the backyard. (This leads to something you never thought youd see an adult male giving mouth-to-mouth resucitation to a dead bird.) The movie is expertly professionally calibrated. I loved the way it played the main relationship between Tripp and Paula off against a minor one (Kit and Barthas Ace) one for laughs with a little poignancy the other for sheer laughs. Every character has been given enough quirk to make the movie sublimely enjoyable but not so much that it becomes precious. Its so relaxed and assured one is stunned to discover that Dey is directing for only the third time and Astle and Ember are primarily TV guys. I wish thered been a little less of an orphaned kid who hangs out with Tripp -- thats a misjudgment; its meant to make us love Tripp but it makes him seem condescending -- and a gimmick where he seems to attract animal bites isnt that funny. But the movie is so swift and sure you can say It achieves liftoff. Failure to Launch (97 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual innuendo.

The pedigree includes ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Meet the Fockers"" ""Hitch"" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Wedding Crashers."" This new entry in the sweepstakes is easily the lamest. The title of the movie could also serve as its review.Matthew McConaughey plays Tripp a 35-year-old goodtime guy who sells yachts and hangs out with two male friends who all have one thing in common They live at home with their parents. Since all the men are presentable and more or less employed the big question is Why?In Tripps case for a long time we are led to believe that he just likes the comforts of home - i.e. having his mother (Kathy Bates) pick up after him and cook his meals. When he brings women inside they are aghast at his living arrangements which is exactly how he wants it. He takes them home when hes ready to dump them. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Tripp is not presented as a cad though. Hes just well a big baby albeit a baby encased in the physiognomy of Peoples latest ""Sexiest Man Alive."" The plot twist comes when his loving but exasperated parents in a last-ditch attempt to get their boy out of the house hire a professional ""consultant"" to lure him away. Sarah Jessica Parkers Paula makes a career out of pretending to be a doting dreamgirl to all the male layabouts still living with their parents. Talk about thankless jobs. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 You dont have to be Aristotle to figure out where this story is going Tripp will fall for Paula who will fall for Tripp who will find out about Paula and break things off followed by the inevitable reconciliation.The rising phenomenon of grown-up children living with their parents is a real one and certainly ripe for comedy. Director Tom Dey (""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Showtime"" perhaps the worst Robert De Niro movie ever made) is not remotely the right candidate for the job. The jokey script by Tom Astle and Matt Ember is subpar even by network-sitcom standards. Typical example On his frequent nature outings the running gag is that Tripp is constantly being bitten - by a chipmunk a lizard a dolphin. The idea is that hes not at one with the natural order of things and the critters know it. Thats why they bite him. Someone should have taken a bite out of this script.All too soon of course it develops that Tripps frolicking is really covering up his need to be loved. Hes afraid of love. So is Paula. Theyre made for each other (if not for us).The films good-time rambunctiousness cant entirely disguise some of its queasiest implications. In the very first scene for example Tripp takes a woman to bed while his parents in an adjoining room prepare for the worst. This scenario was kidded in ""Meet the Parents"" but here the comic tone is so off that you want to avert your eyes from the screen.Parker is bland throughout. Maybe all those episodes of ""Sex and the City"" have soured her on this sort of thing although there isnt much sex here and the action takes places in an oceanside dreamland that is anything but citified. As her grumpy roommate Zooey Deschanel has a one-note role that reaches its high/low point when she shoots a noisy mockingbird with a BB gun. Her boyfriend then gives the bird artificial respiration. I cant remember if it survives or not.McConaughey is enjoyably loosey-goosey even if the movie isnt. At times however he seems a bit unsure of what kind of movie hes supposed to be starring in which is entirely understandable. Maybe he thought he was still acting in ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."" He should be grateful his career has already launched. Grade D+ Rated PG-13 for sexual content partial nudity and language.Sex/Nudity 14 scenes mostly innuendo and implied sex. Violence 7 mild instances. Profanity 32 instances about half harsh. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 14 scenes of drinking 1 of drug use.

"Failure to Launch | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; failure-to-launch ) Failure to Launch (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Failure to Launch fails at more than just launching. It fails at romance and comedy. It fails to make the lead characters interesting and their love affair believable. And it fails to develop a consistent tone that would enable viewers to suspend their disbelief and be carried away by a simple tale of two people falling for each other. Its difficult to say whether the leads are miscast or whether the parts are badly written (likely a combination of both) but the pairing of Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew McConaughey generates as many sparks as a soaked match in a rainstorm. Not only are these two unromantic but their characters are self-absorbed and dull. So its left to the supporting characters to provide Failure to Launchs few occasional pleasures. What does it mean when one of the highlights of a movie is a shot of Terry Bradshaws naked butt? No offense to the ex-quarterbacks sagging cheeks but thats a bad sign. (Bradshaws on-screen spouse Kathy Bates got guffaws - and groans - when she bared all in About Schmidt. The difference is that About Schmidt had a lot more going for it than Failure to Launch.) Other positives are hard to unearth. I liked the Zooey Deschanel character and subplot until her boyfriend gave mouth-to-beak resuscitation to a downed bird. That scene - as well as a few others - belongs in different movie. As a filmmaker why undermine the tenuous ""reality"" of your characters by reducing them to pawns in cartoonish sequences that would be more appropriate in a Saturday Night Live skit? The lovers in this story are Trip (McConaughey) and Paula (Sarah Jessica Parker). Hes a layabout who at age 35 lives with his parents expects his mother to cook and clean for him and uses his living arrangements to get him out of relationships that become serious. Shes an ""interventionist"" - someone Trips Mom (Kathy Bates) and Dad (Terry Bradshaw) hire to get their son to move out. The plan is simple Paula will get Trip to fall for her which will lead to him wanting to assert his independence. Complications ensue. Trip isnt willing to give up his cozy lifestyle. Paula falls for her client and violates her ""no sex"" rule. And Trips friend Ace (Justin Bartha) finds out about the scheme. To keep him quiet Paula offers a date with her ill-tempered roommate Kit (Zooey Deschanel) who has never read Harper Lee but still wants to kill a mockingbird. It puzzles me why a director would assume all thats necessary for a romantic comedy to work is that two recognizable stars be paired together. Chemistry is the single biggest factor in the success of this sort of film. When the actors dont have it as in Failure to Launch the film is doomed. There are some funny moments during the production (although not enough) and some of the supporting characters are worthy of notice but nothing can detract from the gaping hole that exists where the romance is supposed to be. Even the big ""true confessions"" scene comes across as false and contrived. Admittedly irrespective of the movie this obligatory scene is almost always false and contrived but if we believe in the romance we accept it. Failure to Launch doesnt get us close to that point. The tone is uneven. Director Tom Dey drags us on a bumper car ride from over-the-top cartoonish comedy to cheesy melodrama with a variety of stops in between. One of the few bright spots is Zooey Deschanel. 30 minutes into the film I realized I wanted the movie to be about Kit but thats not what the director had in mind. Nevertheless the characters prominence is inexplicable until one looks at the running time. If Failure to Launch relied solely on its main plot it would have clocked in at about 60 minutes. So Kits mockingbird/reluctant romance is necessary to pad things out. Another positive is (surprisingly) Terry Bradshaw who is genuinely funny - although every moment of screen time is designed to build to the buttocks shot. The romantic comedy rules are simple. Filmmakers who follow them may not generate timeless classics but they provide audiences with fantasies that can be savored in the short term. Those who ignore the rules or cant figure out how to make them work are doomed to produce inept and unwieldy pictures that will frustrate viewers by providing glimpses of the fantasy without delivering it. Such is the case with Failure to Launch. Different leads might not have solved all the problems but that move would have represented a step in the right direction. McConaughey and Parker may be popular and charismatic but they look like they would rather be anywhere else except in each others arms.

Conspicuously inspired by magazine articles about a trendy ""Oprah""-worthy syndrome the filmmakers pad the movies allotted time with over-the-top interludes in pursuit of a screwball tone. Although not nearly as bad as its title ""Failure to Launch"" is an especially slight romantic comedy whose modest charms are derived largely from its supporting players. Conspicuously inspired by magazine articles about a trendy ""Oprah""-worthy syndrome -- adult children unwilling to leave their parents homes -- the filmmakers pad the movies allotted time with over-the-top interludes in pursuit of a screwball tone. Blessed with some crowd-pleasing elements ""Launch"" should enjoy modest appeal among the weekend-date crowd but to borrow its terminology it doesnt seem destined to fully achieve liftoff. This is actually the second time Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker have done the ""meet cute"" thing the other coming when he guest starred as himself (not all that convincingly) on ""Sex and the City."" Its too bad however that their characters arent as well buffed and polished as the stars deservedly celebrated physiques. Despite that athletic frame and chiseled jaw fun-loving Tripp (McConaughey) is a 35-year-old man still living with his mom (Kathy Bates) and dad (Terry Bradshaw). In fact his designated method of breaking up with the sundry babes he bags is to bring them home as soon as they exhibit the first sign of becoming too attached. More improbably Tripps best buddies tech geek Ace (Justin Bartha) and world traveler Demo (Bradley Cooper) are also live-at-home examples of this Peter Pan syndrome. Even so they tell Tripp that hes ""afraid of love"" a charge he rejects insisting that his prolonged adolescence is just swell. Tripps parents dont appear particularly upset with the arrangement but after chatting with some blissful neighbors enjoying a newly emptied nest they retain Paula (Parker) a ""professional interventionist"" who promises she can seduce men suffering from ""failure to launch"" thus inspiring them to move out on their own. As Paula soon realizes however Tripp is an atypical case and not just because he and his friends all have weird names. The two share an obvious attraction muddling her carefully orchestrated routine which is built around not becoming too involved. (A moment when we see her with a more conventional ""client"" -- enthusing about the ""Star Wars"" trilogy -- hints at a different and perhaps better movie though theres still the untidy little matter of dumping these losers after romancing them to independence.) Director Tom Dey (""Shanghai Noon"") and TV writing veterans Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember alternate between more down-to-Earth scenes and cartoonish ones. On that latter score Tripp keeps having oddly dangerous encounters with animatronic animals leading to broad slapstick sequences that are incongruous with the rest of the film. Granted there is a belated if somewhat feeble attempt to explain why animals keep attacking Tripp along with why Tripps still at home and how Paula stumbled into this bizarre line of work. But none of it is any more convincing than Tripps absurdly precocious nephew who comes across as sitcom silly. Parker isnt far from her ""Sex"" persona and fares a bit better than McConaughey whose comic chops are less developed than his abs. Pics saving graces and few genuine laughs meanwhile flow from the goofy antics of Bates and Bradshaw with the old quarterback even baring his backfield for the team. Zooey Deschanel also brings some quirkiness to her role as Paulas misanthropic roommate though the two are such unlikely friends it feels as if Deschanel parachuted in from an entirely different movie. Shot in locales that include Maryland New Orleans and Alabama ""Failure to Launch"" ultimately shares something in common with its protagonist that doesnt bode well for its theatrical run While both Tripp and the movie are attractive and far from a total failure neither offers much motivation to leave the house.
