Theyre the words of disgraced cop and escaped convict Nick (Sam Worthington) as he prepares to step on to the window ledge of a Manhattan hotel. Is he suicidal or is a plot afoot? It doesnt take long to find out in this popcorn thriller that throws a conspiracy and a heist into the mix. It turns out Nick has been convicted of stealing a diamond from tycoon David Englander (Ed Harris) a villainous character who leaves us in no doubt as to Nicks innocence. But the cops are far more concerned with preventing Nick from jumping several storeys in front of the baying crowds gathered for the show.If the rubberneckers add a touch of much-needed believability the realism ends there. The main action comes from a cunning plan involving Nicks brother Joey who as played by Jamie Bell is a more interesting character than his wobbly-accented sibling. While Nick is fobbing off police officer Lydia (a solid Elizabeth Banks) Joey and his clothes-shy girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) grapple with security cameras and wriggle through air ducts in a nearby building. Theres more than a whiff of the TV series Prison Break about Joeys protective-brother act not to mention the tidy pace and brazen implausibilities that escalate towards a ridiculous ending. But preposterousness can be forgivable in a B-movie clock-ticker - at least to fans of the genre. This embraces its own lunacy readily enough never aiming for anything more than the disposable thrills it delivers thick and fast.

Ok it doesnt stretch the imagination phenomenally as it is basically a wronged mans attempt to clear his name. Its a film that has been made dozens of times before and you throw in a comic strip badguy and a few corrupt cops for good measure. Leaving this aside there is a degree of warmth between Banks and Worthington and the play on the negotiator down on confidence and in need of someone to believe in is hadly novel but well played. It isnt the best film of its genre as corrupt cops and good and evil is done much better in the Departed and the crime with a twist better in Inside Man but as 90 minutes of entertainment it isnt bad. Its really quite good.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The problem facing the creative team behind ""Man on a Ledge"" is how to keep the movie exciting in a limited space. Its sort of an inaction thriller. If the man goes off the ledge its all over but the cleanup. You can point the camera over the ledge a couple of times for a vertigo-inducing thrill. But since this is a ledge 200 feet above 45th Street in Midtown Manhattan and not the Burj Khalifa a third-of-a-mile over downtown Dubai and the guy up there is Sam Worthington and not Tom Cruise the tension is somewhat less than fingernail-gnawing. The solution to ""now what do we do for 103 minutes?"" is to pile as many silly distractions into the running time as possible. A news helicopter can come by and hover close enough for its rotor to trim Worthingtons sideburns. A snarling real estate tycoon (Ed Harris) whose offices are a block away can be brought in to pound tables as a symbol of the eeeeevil One Percent. A nubile burglar (Genesis Rodriguez) cracking a nearby vault can peel down to her peekaboo underwear in a scene so unapologetically gratuitous that it borders on high comedy. Its pretty much all downhill from there. The best one can say of the screenplay by Pablo Fenjves is that its less implausible than his earlier work as a staffer on the National Enquirer and ghostwriter of O.J. Simpsons notorious memoir ""If I Did It."" I am not making this up. Worthington plays Nick an NYPD detective imprisoned for stealing a 40 million diamond. Now escaped he steps out the window in an attention-grabbing ploy to prove his innocence. A serviceable action figure in ""Avatar"" the last ""Terminator"" movie and ""Clash of the Titans"" Worthington seemed primed to be Australias biggest action star since Mel Gibson. Hes less suited to this static dialogue-heavy role especially since his character sounds as if he just arrived on the red-eye from Melbourne. Then again I doubt that Daniel Day-Lewis could deliver lines like ""How far would you go to get back at a man who took everything from you?"" ""Tintins"" Jamie Bell plays Nicks antagonistic (or is he?) brother Anthony Mackie plays his supportive (or is he?) police force partner and William Sadler cameos as a room-service valet (or is he?). First-time feature director Asger Leth contributes TV-quality setups for TV-quality situations drawing drab workmanlike performances from most of the cast. Harris who seems to have directed his own performance is overblown and cartoonish and impossible to stop watching. Hes like a sarcastic poisonous worm burrowing through the Big Apple. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

In reality that would be like you said a two-minute film. I was eagerly anticipating this thing but now Im skeptical about even renting it out. Is it worth 1.31 at Redbox?

"Man on a Ledge Dont look down the story is in free fall |       NJ.com comments Man on a Ledge Dont look down the story is in free fall Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 27 2012 at 820 AM View/Post Comments Myles Aronowitz The movie is called ""Man on a Ledge"" but right from the start the story is in free fall. The hero Nick is an ex-cop and convicted diamond thief -- who escapes from prison only to check into a midtown hotel order himself a nice dinner and then climb out the window threatening to jump. Pretty soon a crowd forms. Then a nice (and of course beautiful) NYPD negotiator shows up to try to talk him down -- or rather in. He wont budge. But eventually he will tell her and us what hes up to. And its pretty ridiculous. I dont want to give anything away -- although seriously you couldnt give this story away in a box of Cracker Jack. Still skip the next paragraph if youre planning to see it and are completely spoiler-averse. Okay? Okay. So anyway it turns out our cops threatened suicide is just a diversion giving two people the chance to prove him innocent -- by breaking into a high-security vault ""Mission Impossible""-style and showing that the gem Nick is supposed to have stolen was never stolen at all. Okay mild spoilers over. The movie however is pretty badly spoiled from the start. As Nick Sam Worthington -- that big slab of grass-fed Australian beef who everyone keeps saying is going to be big -- is merely bland. As the negotiator Elizabeth Banks is irredeemably perky. Far worse is Jamie Bell as Worthingtons kid brother who fidgets like a small furtive mammal and telenovela star Genesis Rodriguez as the kid brothers girlfriend a Latina spitfire stereotype almost as crushingly restrictive as her purple Wonderbra. And these are the leads folks. As in a lot of movies these days though the supporting actors are the real draw. Ed Burns who is beginning to look like Brian Williams more-fun brother is fine as Banks friend; as Nicks old partner Anthony Mackie is as always as cool and sharp as an icicle. There are also a couple of great whos-that-guy? faces in the cast too including the dog-tired William Sadler as a bellboy and the blisteringly authentic Titus Welliver as an officer who is about one frayed nerve away from putting these young cops through a wall. But without going back into spoiler territory suffice it to say that the plot is ... well the plot is just ridiculous from hissable villains (including a pushy TV reporter straight out of ""Scream"") to some impossible trickery. And although the stunt work is great the direction is strictly point-and-shoot without any real sense of height or space. Actually this is one of the few movies that with its skyscraper action scenes probably needed to be made in 3-D. As it is though its barely in 2-D -- and really Im not sure it needed to be made at all. Ratings note The film contains strong language and violence. Man on a Ledge (PG-13) Summit (102 min.)

AP Photo/Summit Entertainment Myles Aronowitz Myles Aronowitz In this film image released by Summit Entertainment Sam Worthington left and Anthony Mackie are shown in a scene from ""Man on a Ledge."" AP Photo/Summit Entertainment Myles Aronowitz A common gimmick of action movies is to trap the hero in a perilous place. When his success or survival depends on escaping from a shark cage or a speeding bus its called suspense. But when as in the mindless ""Man on a Ledge"" the hero is never really in danger were the ones who are trapped.Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington with a wavering American accent) is an ex-New York cop who is serving a prison sentence for stealing a priceless diamond from gazillionaire David Englander (Ed Harris). But Nick is the proverbial innocent man and he engineers an escape with the help of his hot-headed brother Joey (Jamie Bell).Instead of celebrating his freedom Nick checks into a fancy Manhattan hotel pens a suicide note and steps out onto the high ledge. If ""Man on a Ledge"" were a psychological study or a nail-biter about a wronged hero it might be worth watching. But as Nick teeters above Madison Avenue we know something that a cynical first responder Detective Jack Dougherty (Ed Burns) does not Nicks apparent suicide attempt is actually a distraction so Joey can penetrate Englanders fortress across the street and prove that his brother was framed.Thus for a full hour the ostensible star of the movie loiters on a ledge stonewalling the cops who want to know his name while a cohort and his caliente girlfriend (Genesis Rodriguez) complete the caper.Its a lifeless variation of the thriller formula so the anemic screenplay seeks an infusion of warm blood in the person of a crisis negotiator Detective Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks badly miscast). Mercer is haunted by her failure to save another suicidal cop so she is attentive to Nicks story. Yet she doesnt notice the earpiece that he is wearing or understand that hes muttering instructions to Joey.When an action movie is as clumsy as ""Man on a Ledge"" its begging to fall.

BY FRANK LOVECE. Special to Newsday rafer.guzmannewsday.com. + - In this film image released by Summit Entertainment Sam Worthington left and Anthony Mackie are shown in a scene from ""Man on a Ledge."" Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Perched on a Manhattan high-rise an escaped convict tries to prove his innocence. BOTTOM LINE Cardboard acting and a threadbare plot make this thriller a waste of a perfectly good title. CAST Sam Worthington Elizabeth Banks Jamie Bell Ed Harris LENGTH 142 Whenever Sam Worthington as felon Nick Cassidy scurries along the outside wall of Manhattans Roosevelt Hotel in ""Man on a Ledge"" you might start thinking Hes supposedly on the 21st floor but the highest ledge on the mostly flat-faced Roosevelt is at floor 17. Whats more you can sometimes count a mere 10 windows between Nick and the sidewalk. As a result Nick often looks rather undizzyingly low to the ground. There isnt much else to occupy your mind in ""Man on a Ledge"" a clumsily made thriller with very few thrills. The script feels like a made-to-order job to suit the nifty title -- the author Pablo F. Fenjves is a ghostwriter whose credits include O.J. Simpsons book ""If I Did It"" -- and its threadbare plot wont keep you guessing caring or even vaguely interested. With cardboard characters and perfunctory acting ""Man on a Ledge"" offers little to focus on but mere movie mechanics. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Worthington further squandering his ""Avatar"" fame following 2010s execrable ""Clash of the Titans"" is one of many casting choices here that range from uninspired to ill-advised. He plays Nick as a cliched New York Irish tough while Elizabeth Banks is unconvincing as the world-weary Det. Mercer who suspects Nick is staging an elaborate ruse. Edward Burns and Anthony Mackie are generic movie cops; Jamie Bell (""The Adventures of Tintin"") and Genesis Rodriguez are thieves who bicker cutely while looting the vault of ruthless tycoon David Englander (Ed Harris). In his feature-film debut director Asger Leth (the documentary ""Ghosts of Cite Soleil"") sends people flying in and out of windows but hes stuck not only to a ledge but to an atrocious script. ""Jump Jump"" yell the onlookers below and you may be tempted to join them. PLOT Perched on a Manhattan high-rise an escaped convict tries to prove his innocence. RATING PG-13 (violence and brief strong language) MoviesTop 100 biggest movies of all time CAST Sam Worthington Elizabeth Banks Jamie Bell Ed Harris advertisement | advertise on newsday LENGTH 142 PLAYING AT Area theaters BOTTOM LINE Cardboard acting and a threadbare plot make this thriller a waste of a perfectly good title. Sets and the city Its really Bethpage MoviesBiggest movie opening weekends ""Man on a Ledge"" wasnt Manhattan on a screen Aside from a few establishing shots most of its Manhattan was actually in Bethpage at the recently opened Gold Coast Studios. In fact says studio head Lyndsey Lostritto ""Man on a Ledge"" was its inaugural shoot. ""We opened in September 2010] and they were at our studio October through February and that included building the sets and filming."" The productions two main sets she says were of ""the Roosevelt Hotel both the exterior and the interior; the Manhattan skyline was done green-screen. You could almost have moved into that hotel it looked so real"" Jake Myers one of the films executive producers says they also shot some stunt sequences outside the building with sets built in the parking lot. Additionally he says the jail sequences were partially done at Sing Sing (in Ossining) and partially at the Nassau County jail in East Meadow.

Wont somebody please cast Aussie actor Sam Worthington as an Australian for a change? Its the role he was born to play. As a disgraced former NYPD officer in this unconvincing and incoherent thriller his accent wavered as frequently as my attention. We begin as Worthingtons business-attired Nick Cassidy checks into Midtowns Roosevelt Hotel and heads up to the 21st floor for a suite with a splendid view. After a breakfast of Champagne and lobster he pens a note opens a window and climbs out because -- well youve seen the title. Whats his story? Flash back to his incarceration a month ago in Sing Sing where this whole mess began. PHOTOS ""MAN ON A LEDGE"" FILMING IN NY And I do mean mess. What follows is a jumble of cop- and heist-movie cliches dotted with appearances by actors you liked in something else Anthony Mackie as Nicks friend and former partner Elizabeth Banks as the brooding NYPD negotiator Ed Harris as Mr. Burns of ""The Simpsons"" incarnate. It seems Nick has been framed and his ledge-based stance is a desperate last shot at clearing his name. While a crowd gathers below and a seasoned detective (Ed Burns) cracks wise about sending this guy to the nuthouse the pacing Nick demands the presence of Lydia Mercer (Banks) whose last assignment to talk down a suicidal cop on the Brooklyn Bridge didnt end so well. Meanwhile director Asger Leth (""Ghosts of Cite Soleil"") sends Nicks brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and his foxy girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) on a ""Mission Impossible""-type stunt then immediately undermines it by making Rodriguezs cleavage the focal point of the mission. (Im pretty sure even Ethan Hunt would advise a comely companion against using Victorias Secret garb as spywear.) Why are Angies boobs breaking into the building? Not to spoil it but its the lynchpin of Nicks defense -- and yet another overused cinematic device. The movies at its best when cutting back and forth between Nick and Joey as Nick tries to converse with Lydia in lines of conversation that double as instructions into the earpiece hes wearing to communicate with his brother. But Worthington must carry the bulk of the film alone and hes not quite up to the task. Hes an actor who does the stoic tough-guy thing terrifically -- even in duds like ""Clash of the Titans"" -- but telegraphing emotions isnt really his strong suit. Stranding him on a foot of concrete where he cant get into even one fistfight seems like a waste of a good paycheck. The only person who seems to get the nongravity of the situation is Kyra Sedgwick as local newscaster Suzie Morales emphasis on the trilled ""r."" She doggedly interviews people in the mob on Madison Avenue where those who arent baying for Nick to take the plunge are proclaiming him a working-class hero. But my favorite was the elderly woman crankily shoving her way through the chaos ""Anybody who creates traffic like this in Midtown"" she says rightly ""should be shot.""

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 27 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 224PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Acrophobia or fear of heights has become a favourite effect in movies the last couple of months from Brett Ratners Tower Heist to Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol and now the would-be thriller Man on a Ledge in which credibility takes a nose-dive long before its protagonist is separated from his perch. Movies Man on a Ledge The official trailer Actor Sam Worthington arrives at a premiere of the feature film ""Last Night"" during the Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto on Saturday Sept. 18 2010. AP Movies Video Sam Worthingtons a Man on a Ledge In an opening scene Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) checks into Manhattans Roosevelt Hotel pays cash at the front desk and orders a fancy dinner with champagne. He wipes the room clear of finger prints and then steps out onto the window ledge. A crowd forms below on the street waving their smartphone cameras to take pictures and encouraging him to jump. All this seems improbable for the relatively polite (and very busy) New York of 2012 but it seems to be a case of the screenplay showing its roots. The opening echoes director Henry Hathaways 1951 classic Fourteen Hours and there are touches of Dog Day Afternoon here as well. None of it rings true except perhaps the presence of an ambitious local TV news reporter (Kyra Sedgwick) who begins recording every macabre moment with relish. Ed Burns is the New York detective in a Columbo trench coat who gets into the hotel room and tries to find out the strangers reason for being on the ledge. Were not kept in the dark for long. A flashback to a month earlier reveals that Nick is a former New York cop who somehow ended up in prison and then managed to escape after being temporarily released for his fathers funeral. His misfortunes are somehow tied to a predatory Donald Trump-style cocky developer David Englander (Ed Harris) who by no coincidence is about to unveil his new high-rise tower on the same day at a press conference. Nick is out on the ledge to create a diversion while his younger brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and his feisty girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) engage in a break-in to clear Nicks name. As part of his plan to prove his innocence Nick demands to speak to Detective Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) a cop and counsellor who lost a jumper a month previously and whom he seems to have researched extensively. She arrives at the scene and begins trying to talk him down. The actors have a likeable rapport and its easy enough to stay alert each time the camera assumes Nicks point-of-view for a stomach-lurching view of the street below. The real problems come when the camera wanders away from the precipice. Writer Pablo F. Fenjves (best known as the ghostwriter of O.J. Simpsons If I Did It) has a reliably tin ear for dialogue and broadly-drawn characters especially Ed Harriss fire-breathing cartoon. Similarly there are gimmicky cutaways to Joey and Angies slapstick break-in complete with opportunities for her to strip down to her underwear while the two engage in inane sexual banter. Also wasted is the fine Anthony Mackie ( The Hurt Locker) as Nicks former partner. The movie provides the paradox of many high-concept thrillers At first Man on a Ledge seems like a film about the fear of heights; after the first half hour the only real tension is worrying about how low it might sink.

He might have been better cast as the ledge. Previously foisted upon us in Avatar Termination Salvation and Clash of the Titans Worthington is the worlds dullest up-and-coming action star and Man on a Ledge shows him in no danger of relinquishing that title. But there are interesting people around him in the film an unambitious but competent heist thriller directed by documentarian Asger Leth (Ghosts of Cite Soleil) that also features Elizabeth Banks Jamie Bell and Ed Harris. The result is dumb easy-to-swallow fun more or less -- the sort of movie that makes people say ""Well that wasnt as bad as I thought it would be."" Worthington plays Nick Cassidy a New York City cop who was convicted -- wrongly he alleges -- for committing a felony against David Englander (Ed Harris) a ruthless real estate mogul. Now Nick finds himself on an upper-story ledge of a Manhattan hotel threatening to jump and refusing to reveal his identity to anyone. He tells the cop (Edward Burns) trying to talk him down that he wants to speak to a specific detective a troubled investigator named Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks). While this is going on so are some other things. As you might have guessed Nicks threats of suicide are not the real issue here. His brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joeys girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are involved as is his former partner Mike Ackerman (Anthony Mackie). Oh and Kyra Sedgwick plays a TV reporter covering the ledge drama but her character is laughably pointless. The secret master plan is eventually revealed to be convoluted and idiotic as is often the case in movies about secret master plans. Pablo F. Fenjves screenplay offers only perfunctory glimpses into the characters mindsets and gives them very little to say that is memorable funny or interesting. Only Ed Harris gets to have any fun playing the billionaire villain with over-the-top rage and indignation. He throws a wristwatch at a wall in anger. That part is memorable. For as generic as the film is though its not irritating and its never boring. Its too industrious to fall into those traps -- theres too much going on and even though most of it is nonsense at least its watchable nonsense. Harris Bell and Banks all working well below their proficiency level give it some spice. I suspect a lot of people will be paying a dollar to rent this from Redbox in a few months. From an economic standpoint that sounds about right.

Elizabeth Banks is a police negotiator trying to get Sam Worthington to climb back into his hotel room.Sponsored LinksBut more often the film succumbs to cliches grows convoluted and outlandish and winds up dead on arrival.Faulty logic is too pervasive and flashes of dark humor are too few. One particular gag involving a reporter played by Kyra Sedgwick starts out comical but gets repeated so often as to render it unfunny.STORY Elizabeth Banks steps out on a LedgeSam Worthington plays Nick Cassidy an ex-cop who escapes from prison and ends up perched on a ledge at a swanky Manhattan hotel. The gathering crowds morbidly urge him to jump. But theres no tension or sense of danger in his gambit. We know theres more to his tenuous position but none of it is compelling.Elizabeth Banks miscast as police negotiator Lydia Mercer tries to talk him down. But this is no ordinary suicide attempt. Its an absurd robbery scheme involving Cassidy his goofball brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and his brothers street-smart girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez). Her wardrobe for a cat burglar mission is hilarious in its carefully orchestrated skimpiness. That ploy indicates that the filmmakers knew they had a dud and needed to rely on eye candy to distract audiences.Man on a Ledge Los Angeles premiereIts not clear if the movie means to send up police procedures or adhere slavishly to them. Just when it seems like it might have some fun with the premise it reverts to preposterous plot turns.Cassidy was an NYPD cop charged with brazenly stealing a 40 million diamond from one of the citys wealthiest real estate developers (Ed Harris in a thankless role). Thats a pretty high-profile crime but somehow all of the NYPD officers who show up dont recognize him. Officials dont learn Cassidys identity until about a third of the way into the story. Much is made of how hes cleverly wiped his fingerprints off every surface in the hotel room. But didnt he require his hands to climb out the hotel window and clamber onto the ledge?It turns out that revealing his identity is fairly immaterial since this is all part of a larger scheme familiar to any movie-watcher disgraced man determined to clear his name. But the specific scheme is where things get ridiculously implausible. Its not clear what Joey and Angie do for day jobs but theyre so elusive and agile they could give seminars to international art thieves.The audience is not privy to the elaborate planning and preparation between family members to mastermind Cassidys prison break and gadget-filled heist. For good reason It could never have been pulled off.The leaps of logic in Man on a Ledge grow more preposterous while the plot machinations rev to ridiculous heights right up to the very end.

"Man on a Ledge has high thrills little edge review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Sam WorthingtonReview Man on a Ledge has high thrills little edgeSam Worthington does a frighteningly good job dangling high above New York but the story behind Man on a Ledge falls strangely flat.January 27 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Sam Worthington in a scene from ""Man on a Ledge."" (Myles Aronowitz / Associated...)When a guy steps onto a narrow ledge many stories above a messy bit of New York City asphalt you figure it is someone in dire straights taking desperate measures. In ""Man on a Ledge"" that guy is an ex-cop convicted felon and recent prison escapee played by Sam Worthington a a situation that is about as fraught as it gets. And yet Worthingtons Nick Cassidy doesnt seem all that frantic in fact except for a couple of deep breaths he barely breaks a sweat. I on the other hand was gripping anything in reach palms dripping thinking I might not have survived the effects had they been 3-D. Though there were other production sites serious time was spent actually shooting on that 14-inch ledge wrapping the 21st floor of the Roosevelt Hotel to create the vicarious sensation of being there. Which worked frighteningly well at least for the vertiginous among us. Oh that the actual human dynamics of the unfolding story could have been as dramatic as on the edge as that ledge. Since that is not the case lets give props to the real stars and the reason for any of the thrills in this otherwise strangely flat film director of photography Paul Cameron production designer Alec Hammond art director David Swayze visual effects supervisor Richard Kidd and the rest of the crew. Directed by Asger Leth from a patchy script written by Pablo F. Fenjves a specialist in B-movie thrillers of ""The Devils Child"" and ""Twilight Man"" sort the film starts on the ground with Cassidys escape from a no-parole life. Its the kind of fast-moving sequence that begins with bruising body blows and ends with harrowing car chases which suits Worthingtons action-hero talents though better showcased in ""Avatar"" and ""Terminator Salvation."" After a quick bit of cleaning up a nice dinner and some champagne Nick steps onto that ledge as part of a bold and clearly risky bid to prove his innocence. And thats where the trouble begins. As promised this is about a man on a ledge and Nick will spend a great deal of the rest of the film clinging balancing or inching this way and that along it. A precarious position to be sure but one that requires a kind of naked performance that allows the audience to experience the risk-reward churn that must be going on somewhere inside. That we dont get. Nick does attract the crowd of witnesses he wants as a jumper will do and the 24-hour news teams with Kyra Sedgwick doing a caricature of the vulture culture as a brassy TV reporter. Meanwhile Nick refuses to talk to anyone but NYPD negotiator Lydia Spencer (Elizabeth Banks). Lydia has a bad rap tied to the death of a rookie cop that she failed to talk down from a bridge. Like Lydia Banks cant seem to catch a break. She stepped up in interesting ways in the indie ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" opposite Seth Rogen but more often shes landed in roles that dont ask much. Here shes supposed to telegraph tough and vulnerable in the snatches of conversation she has out the window with Nick but shes not given the time or the text to pull it off. While Lydia tries to talk him down Nicks brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joeys girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are across the street trying to pull off a high-tech heist that will theoretically crack the case wide open. It involves Ed Harris as a corrupt real estate mogul who had a hand in sending Cassidy to jail. Ed Burns Lydias rival on the force and Anthony Mackie as Cassidys former partner and best friend drift in and out making an effort try to juice the plot. But the only two who actually spice things up are Bell and Rodriguez racing against time while sniping and slipping though some fleeting sexually charged moments.

As a police psychologist works to talk down an ex-con who is threatening to jump from a Manhattan hotel rooftop the biggest diamond heist ever committed is in motion. Video courtesy of Summit Entertainment. By John Anderson January 27 2012 It wont make his publicists happy to hear it but Sam Worthington is easily the biggest movie star in the world who wouldnt be recognized if he walked down a Manhattan street. Or if he climbed out onto the ledge of an East Side hotel and stood there for 100 minutes. Which is strange considering that he was the star of the biggest movie in the world (""Avatar"") and the 160th biggest movie in the world (""Terminator Salvation"") and that he appeared last year in a mixed bag of features that included ""The Debt"" ""Last Night"" and ""Texas Killing Fields."" ENLARGE Sam Worthington in Man on a Ledge Summit Entertainment But his Everyman-ish qualities serve him well in ""Man on a Ledge"" director Asger Leths wryly twisted caper film. Mr. Worthington is a colossus of anonymity. ""Man on a Ledge"" is a movie that employs all the mechanics of a standard Hollywood thriller while taking sidelong glances at the same voyeurism that fuels both the film and cinema itself. Its not ""Rear Window"" The ending for instance is so ridiculously tidy it squeaks. But en route to its kitchen-sink climax ""Man"" manages to both amuse and provoke to cleave to convention and promote ideas. And it isnt in 3-D. Theaters may want to consider charging triple admission. We meet Mr. Worthingtons Nick Cassidy as he emerges from the subway at Sixth Avenue crosses a city abuzz with anonymous life checks into a room at the matronly Roosevelt Hotel and eats the greater part of a mediocre meal. He then wipes down every surface hes touched and climbs out the window. It isnt long before hes spotted by the crowd on Madison Avenue and not much longer before police detectives including the acerbic Jack Dougherty (Ed Burns) realize that there isnt a fingerprint in the room by which to identify their would-be leaper. And that this is no ordinary suicide attempt. Its just a theory of course but the sign of a worthy thriller may be how eagerly you want to revisit it just to see where you went wrong--or where the movie did in timing its narrative twists and ""aha"" moments and in providing sufficient information that one doesnt feel hoodwinked by holes in the plot. ""Man on a Ledge"" takes its sweet time explaining Nicks problem and his intended solution doling out relevant details like state secrets. But the structure seems sound and it isnt giving anything away to disclose what viewers almost immediately learn via flashback That Nick was an ex-cop serving 25-years at Sing Sing where he fought with other inmates and revealed to the prison psychiatrist that yes he thinks about killing himself all the time. What follows is a hair-raising escape involving an SUV and a freight train after which Nick concocts the grand design that brings him 200 feet above midtown. Mr. Leth the son of renowned Danish documentarian Jorgen Leth has directed only one other film ""Ghosts of Cite Soleil"" a highly stylized doc that revealed a soul yearning to breathe free of nonfiction. He has an instinct for weaving sturdy narrative fabric out of intersecting plot lines While Nick keeps the city gawking his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joeys girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are busy breaking into the building across the street owned by evil real-estate titan David Englander (Ed Harris). The police suicide specialist called to the scene Lydia (Elizabeth Banks) has her own set of problems She recently failed to talk another ex-cop off the Brooklyn Bridge so shes dubbed ""the grim reaper"" by her less-enlightened colleagues. Meanwhile Nicks old partner Mike (Anthony Mackie) knows the whole story behind the stunt going on up above. So were watching the enormously talented Mr. Mackie even more intently than usual. Amid the hoopla Mr. Leth takes sobering assessment of media-circuses and mob mentalities The people down below taking cellphone pictures the ones yelling ""Jump""; the callous nature of cops for whom its all routine. Theres the occasional goofy grace note Kyra Sedgwick playing a voracious and obviously Anglo television reporter named Suzie Morales rolls the R in her surname as she signs off just in case someone missed the point (weve all heard it). In another scene Mr. Leth takes such pains to strip the shapely Ms. Rodriguez down to her underwear that audiences who may well be leering will also be laughing at how obvious it is. There is a lot to forgive it must be said Myriad coincidences a ridiculous helicopter scene cops taking hip-shots throughout the hallways of the Roosevelt Hotel. But there are deft touches too When Lydia orders Jack out of the hotel so she can talk privately to the man on the ledge Mr. Burnss voice jumps up an octave just as it might if the man behind it felt threatened by a woman. Its the kind of parenthetical subtlety one doesnt expect from many mainstream movies but especially one working so hard for exclamation points. The Grey ENLARGE Liam Neeson in The Grey Open Road Films The gas-refinery roughneck workers heading home from Alaska in Joe Carnahans ""The Grey"" face disasters of near biblical proportions. When their plane goes down it crashes onto a tract of uncharted tundra rips itself asunder and kills most of the passengers save for a half-dozen traumatized survivors. They have little food little hope and are marooned in a gale-force blizzard in which they can barely think much less act. Also there are wolves. The reassuring factor in all this is Ottway who was the companys hired killer Before the crash he had spent his days shooting predators around the perimeter of the refinery and morosely obsessing about the woman he lost. He knows a lot about wolves which helps as does the fact that hes played by Liam Neeson whose physical authority has always been one of his great assets. One gets the sense that they all might live through it even if Ottway has to carry them on his back. Mr. Carnahan has till now been pigeonholed and rightly by comedy shoot-em-ups like ""Smokin Aces"" and ""The A-Team."" But here he is with ""The Grey""--certainly an adventure film but one with a spiritual ingredient that is both surprising and fiercely resonant. Albert Nobbs ENLARGE Mia Wasikowska and Glenn Close in Albert Nobbs Roadside Attractions Were one to approach ""Albert Nobbs"" with absolutely no foreknowledge of its premise or plot the effect would be bewildering. Say isnt that Glenn Close? Why in the world is she dressed so oddly? And why is everyone calling her Mr. Nobbs? Ah youd say Ms. Close--for whom this Rodrigo Garcia-directed soap opera has just earned a 30th or 40th Oscar nomination--is playing a woman who for years has lived as a man working as a butler in a turn-of-the-20th-century Dublin hotel. And one would assume that even in the Ireland of a hundred-odd years ago people could tell a woman from a man. Many leaps of faith are required for the watching of this novelty film adapted from a short story by George Moore (""The Singular Life of Albert Nobbs"") and one which has attracted quite a bit of attention from gay-oriented journals sites organizations and critics. All of whom ignore the fact that Ms. Closes impersonation is utterly preposterous. A short haircut cannot conceal her sex nor can all the bindings in the world nor apparently a generous troweling of makeup. The masquerade works a bit better for the strapping Janet McTeer who plays Alberts fellow transvestite a housepainter who goes by the name of Hubert Page and opens Alberts eyes to possibilities hed never thought existed. Hubert is married to a woman named Cathleen (Bronagh Gallagher) and Albert is dumbstruck How did she/he do it? As he saves his pence and nurtures his modest dream of opening a tobacco shop he is overcome with hope Might he have a wife someday to man the counter in his store? Its a poignant tale one played for maximum mawkishness and one that relies at least a little on a belief that Alberts pretense might actually work. ""Albert Nobbs"" is the kind of thing an actress does with an Oscar in her cross hairs and as one of this weeks five Best Actress nominees Ms. Close is considerably closer to her goal. As an experiment in Academy Award psychology ""Albert Nobbs"" is fascinating. As drama? It is forgive us a drag. The Theatre Bizarre Even hard-core movie buffs may be oblivious to the world of horror/fantasy cinema that flourishes just below the surface of mainstream respectability--one that exists largely on DVD or at events like the Fantasia festival in Montreal or Fantastic Fest in Austin Texas. As a macabre primer to this parallel universe we suggest ""The Theatre Bizarre"" a portmanteau both ghastly and intelligent featuring a murderers row of contemporary horrors more prominent practitioners. Producer David Gregorys conceit was to set half a dozen directors free to explore the traditions of Grand Guignol. The results--from among others South African cult director Richard Stanley makeup wizard Buddy Giovinazzo and the talented Douglas Buck--are alternately shocking shockingly existential and/or tender in ways that belie stereotypes. When horror makes it to the mall its generally a mess. ""The Theatre Bizarre"" may not be everyones cup of tea. But within its genre its state-of-the-art. --Mr. Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD Focus ENLARGE Dog Day Afternoon (1975) Based on the celebrated Brooklyn bank robbery of the summer of 1972 director Sidney Lumets classic New York drama stars Al Pacino whose Sonny Wortzik wants to get money for his boyfriends sex-change operation and winds up with a bank full of innocent bystanders. Mr. Lumets melding of hostage negotiation media circus and the rather tender portrayal of his principal holdup men added up to a biting societal critique and set a standard often imitated and seldom equaled. Trivia buffs will remember that Mr. Pacinos co-star the late John Cazale made only five movies but each was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. Phone Booth (2003) Colin Farrell plays the sleazy New York publicist pinned down by a sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) in this Joel Schumacher-directed thriller written by Larry Cohen. Mr. Cohen had been cultivating the idea for years (hed even suggested it to Alfred Hitchcock) and by the time the film finally got made cellphones had rendered phone booths nearly obsolete. Still there are moments of terror and a genuine sense of the New York streets even if much of the atmosphere seemed to have been imported from the 1970s. Radha Mitchell Katie Holmes and Forest Whitaker co-star. Safety Last (1923) A silent masterpiece in which Harold Lloyds climb up the outside of a Los Angeles department store culminates in the famous ""clock scene"" in which he dangles from the big hand while accelerating audience heartbeats. The stunt was only a little less dangerous than it looks and careful viewers will spot the glove Mr. Lloyd wore one on his right hand disguising the missing thumb and index finger he lost in a 1919 bomb explosion. Likewise visitors to Graumans Chinese Theatre in Hollywood will notice that Lloyds right hand made a lighter impression than his left when pressed into the wet cement outside. --John Anderson 15 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Myles Aronowitz/Summit Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Myles Aronowitz/Summit Entertainment Man On A Ledge Director Asger Leth Genre Action Thriller Running Time 102 minutes Rated PG-13 for violence and brief strong language With Sam Worthington Elizabeth Banks Jamie Bell Ed Harris Watch Clips From Man On A Ledge - Family Bonds Family Bonds Credit Summit Entertainment From Man On A Ledge - Diversion Diversion Credit Summit Entertainment From Man On A Ledge - Played Played Credit Summit Entertainment Its an arresting image Sam Worthington out on that 40th-story ledge. Hes a fairly tough-looking guy after all and we know him best as the tooth-gritting blockbuster hero of Avatar and Clash of the Titans so its head-spinning to see the mans beefy figure as a speck hovering so precariously close to New Yorks infinite sky. The camera swirls around Worthingtons disgraced former cop Nick Cassidy inching out past that thin strip of architecture then back in. What if he trips or jumps? For a while anything seems possible and its both exhilarating and terrifying. Then the wool comes off and its clear that director Asger Leth and screenwriter Pablo Fenjves have ambitions considerably less grand than their protagonists perch. Cassidys ledge game -- with all the studio-unfriendly moral ambiguities it entails -- is just a con a photo op for the crowds and Nicks apparent desire to exit the material world is a front. What he truly passionately wants to do is steal some jewelry. As Nick from way up high barks instructions into a microphone we watch a diamond heist play out inside a metallic gray high-security complex. Well ""high-security"" This is the sort of Hollywood vault designed for easy criminal access where everything is Fort Knox-level secure except the air vents and where the entire computer system comes undone with the snipping of a single red wire. Nicks brother (Jamie Bell) and his barely dressed girlfriend (Genesis Rodriguez) are pulling the heist on his nemesis a snarly real-estate mogul (Ed Harris enjoying himself) who framed Nick into a life sentence hes currently on the run from. But just in case Nicks justified revenge plot has created the illusion of importance Bell and Rodriguez re-affirm the plans frivolity by bickering and squabbling about their relationship the entire time. Elizabeth Banks projecting a sort of exasperated allure as Nicks negotiator brings a level of gravity to the situation not felt by anyone else including Nick. Her characters backstory -- the last guy she tried to talk off a bridge ignored her and jumped into the great beyond -- is intriguingly messy but since we know far earlier than we should that Nicks not planning anything life-threatening this detail is wasted. With miscues like this the film aims for Hitchcock and gets a bit turned around; were The Audience That Knew Too Much. Director Leth comes from an esteemed filmmaking family -- his father is Jorgen Leth the renowned experimentalist best known for his 1967 short The Perfect Human. And he knows his way around a scene as evidenced by the films dizzying ledge work. All this helps explain why the films descent into generic silliness feels more painful than it should for a late-January thriller. Thats not to say Man on a Ledge is completely bereft of entertainment value or invention. Its always fun to see TV reporters depicted as attention-crazed sociopaths and Kyra Sedgwick fits that bill nicely. Harris too is great fun in a tailored suit and an I-am-the-1-percent smirk. And theres an endearing quality to Nicks brashness the way he uses his platform to captivate a growing crowd of admirers. Maybe thats the grandest way to go proclaiming your existence to the heavens by bellowing ""I am an innocent man"" For those who remember Joel Schumachers Phone Booth an eerie economical 2003 thriller set entirely in and around Colin Farrells public glass prison its hard not to wonder what Man on a Ledge could have been with just a little more restraint. Both films place men in extraordinary predicaments under the public eye but Phone Booth demonstrated faith in the power of both claustrophobia and the slow reveal. The twitchy Ledge cant wait to open up its scope but it loses its footing in the process -- and Nick didnt start with too much room to stand.

People must be really hungry for a movie about justice. A few nights ago a packed house at a preview for ""Man on a Ledge cheered at the plot twists and the big comeuppance scene. They didnt care that none of the actors has anything to do. You could cast this movie with potato chips and still get cheers when one of the bad guys is cuffed. It doesnt matter that none of it is to be believed.When New York police detectives including one played by Ed Burns show up to talk Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) a fugitive who swears hes innocent down from a Manhattan hotel ledge he requests a specific officer. Its Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) who when we meet her might be waking up after a bender but looks and acts like Elizabeth Banks and not at all like a bleary Detective Lydia. This is one of those cops Who Made a Big Mistake that she must spend the rest of the movie ruing until redemption. But Banks just isnt that sort of performer. She projects too much confidence to screw anything up and too much intelligence to do any of what Lydia does namely to climb out on the ledge alongside Nick and not throw herself off.In any case across town Jamie Bell and Genesis Rodriguez play a young couple breaking into a building - and by ""across town I mean across the street. They climb through an elevator shaft and crack a safe. They have gadgets gear and banter. But for the same price of admission you could attend Tom Cruises master class in ludicrous stunt work and never think once what you do watching Bell and Rodriguez I could do that - even though its impossible.Yes what theyre up to is directly connected to what Nick is up to and the trailers and ads dont make a secret of the relationship between one side of the street and the other. But there are other increasingly implausible surprises one of which requires us to believe that no one in the entire NYPD can identify Nick from say the live updates from Kyra Sedgwicks pushy TV reporter. Others involve such actors as Anthony Mackie Titus Welliver and a dapper dastardly Ed Harris.The movie doesnt give an audience anything that makes sense. How does Harris smoke a cigar that appears to weigh more than he does? And whence is Worthingtons accent? He sounds like Russell Crowe on ""Serpico night at the Jazz Hands Cafe. The script by Pablo F. Fenjves has a rigged sense of justice and calls for at least one stunt sequence that works only in the movies and appears to use actual movie stunt props. Asger Leth directed ""Man on a Ledge. It has the on-the-street grit of Sidney Lumets New York if Lumets New York was just a single-player game by Electronic Arts and if you think all Lumet did to make his magic was use lots of unsteady camerawork and rely on chases through hotel suites and kitchens.The movie has a kind of outsize desperation. All it wants to do is wow us.And theres just enough for an eager malnourished audience to cheer. But its the greasiest entertainment. Youre not going to the movies really. Youre pulling up to the drive-thru. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

Comments click to enlarge Man on a Ledge Recommended Video Rated PG-13  102 minutes  2012 Asger Leth best known for the political documentary Ghosts of Cite Soleil (2006) isnt someone I expected to revive the taut unpretentious crime filmmaking that flourished in 1950s Hollywood but this noirish thriller is as self-knowingly ludicrous and thoroughly enjoyable as Fritz Langs Beyond a Reasonable Doubt or While the City Sleeps. A former cop (Sam Worthington) sent up the river by an evil tycoon (Ed Harris) escapes from prison and stages the title suicide attempt as part of a plot to rob his nemesis. Leth moves lightly and briskly streamlining the weird material into something elemental and true; hes also assembled a knockout supporting cast showcasing Anthony Mackie Ed Burns (well-used for once as an arrogant police detective) and Jamie Bell (exuberant and highly physical as the heros brother and partner in crime).

In this slight but crowd-pleasing caper a blue-collar hero (Sam Worthington) seeks revenge against an unrepentant 1 percenter (Ed Harris) who callously used him as a pawn in a 40 million insurance scam. Worthington (Avatar Terminator Salvation) plays Nick Cassidy who checks into Manhattans Roosevelt Hotel one morning orders lobster and fries from room service and then resolutely assumes a perch on a ledge 21 stories up. Logic insisted he wouldnt go splat but still I recoiled every time the camera followed Nicks gaze downward to the sidewalk where a gathering crowd alternately shrieked in horror every time he made a move on the ledge or shouted encouragement to him to jump. Its fun in a perverse way; the viewer gets to experience a vivid sense of what it feels like to occupy a pigeon-poop smeared piece of stone high in the sky. The vertigo comes in small doses thank heavens. From the title I expected to spend the rest of the movie on that overhang assuming Nick (and the story) would be pinned there in much the same way Colin Farrell and Ryan Reynolds were bound to their locations -- respectively a phone booth and a coffin -- in 2002s Phone Booth and 2010s Buried. But director Asger Leth is not wedded to that narrow space. In short order he both delivers flashbacks and cuts to action in the surrounding blocks that illuminate Nicks motives. A former cop he got a bum deal at the hands of the owner of the building across the street -- David Englander (Harris) a former jewel merchant turned real estate magnate -- and languished in prison for a couple of years. By time Nick steps out on the ledge he has nothing to lose and everything including freedom and the restoration of his good name to gain. Nick has unclear but obviously very specific reasons for being on this ledge at this time and the movie teases with questions at each turn. Why for instance does Nick immediately ask to negotiate with a specific cop an NYPD pariah named Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks bringing the right note of ennui to an underwritten part)? Whats up with Nicks little brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and his girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) an impossibly gorgeous tough-talking Latina stereotype who are simultaneously undertaking some Mission Impossible-style operation that involves breaking into a high security office suite nearby?  This amusingly clumsy duo seem to have learned all their badass techniques from movies and its fun to watch them revel in each step they successfully complete almost despite themselves. Theyre just slightly less bumbling than the Tower Heist gang. The movie is deeply dependent on its supporting players. Harris the one heavyweight on board invests a campy level of malice to his role but hes no more than a caricature. The actual star Worthington makes for an awkward hero his barely suppressed native Australian accent a distraction and his manner decidedly low-key. Worthington has the harried shaggy look of a young Dennis Quaid and a similar physical presence -- solid meaty a real mans man. But lacking Quaids leavening mischievous streak hes easier to like than to fall for. His stolidity worked in another tale of go-for-broke self-sacrifice Avatar but there he was surrounded by color and vibrancy however silly. Here he blends right into the greys and browns of the building hes perched on. Instead the movie stays aloft on the sparks provided by Banks Ed Burns (playing a skeptical cop) Anthony Mackie (as a cop to be skeptical about) and particularly Bell and Rodriguez. ""Really?"" Joey asks when he notices Angie applying lip gloss halfway somewhere between climbing up an elevator shafts and crawling through an air vent. ""Doing that now huh?"" Her shrug says it all why not? At one point I worried that Joey and Angie might accidentally screw up the master plan by pausing to tear each others clothes off. If so Joey could hardly be blamed; Rodriguez does the same kind of justice to a catsuit that Catherine Zeta Jones did to that sleek garment in Entrapment. I dont think Ill be the only viewer to care more about the charming couple across the street than the imperiled man on the ledge.

(Myles Aronowitz/Everett Collection) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday January 26 2012 1200 PM Title Man on a Ledge Film Info PG-13 Language sexuality violence. At area theaters. ""You gotta love New York"" says a stock character in Asger Leths stolidly literal-minded ""Man on a Ledge."" But New Yorkers are probably too sharp to fall for this movies obvious ploys. While Leth does work hard to inject some local character into his tense thriller the stars and setup are pure Hollywood. An incongruously gorgeous Elizabeth Banks plays down-and-out Detective Mercer whos ordered to midtowns Roosevelt Hotel on an apparent suicide call. The man on the ledge is Nick Cassidy (stiff Sam Worthington) himself a former NYPD officer. Cassidy was convicted of stealing a huge diamond from amoral tycoon David Englander (Ed Harris) and has just broken out of jail to prove his innocence. His complex plan includes his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joeys girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) who are busy taking risks of their own. While a cheering crowd gathers some 20 stories below Nick does his best to convince Mercer that he needs more time. Screenwriter Pablo Fenjves start with a promising premise and the opening scenes are taut and suspenseful. A late-day chase scene picks up the sagging middle but Leth totally fumbles what should be the movies biggest moment. The primary problem is that he seems to want things both ways seeking gritty socially relevant New York realism from an unconvincingly glam cast -- including Kyra Sedgwick and Anthony Mackie -- saddled with hokey dialogue. Only Harris and Edward Burns as Banks seen-it-all supervisor overcome these obstacles. Leth does himself no favors by emphasizing his debt to the 70s filmmakers who actually achieved his aims. (At one point the crowd even starts shouting ""Attica"" in reference to Sidney Lumets ""Dog Day Afternoon."" Suffice it to say that Worthington is no Al Pacino.) Like Cassidy Leth never quite knows whether to jump or stand firm. Too often he just winds up wobbling in the wind.

Man on a Ledge Bad Director Asger Leth. Cast Sam Worthington Elizabeth Banks Jamie Bell. Rating PG-13 for violence and brief strong language. Pun intended. Groaner though it may be its still more clever than some of the jaw-dropping silliness in director Asger Leths film. Maybe its Leths fault. Or maybe its the fault of screenwriter Pablo F. Fenjves. Dont blame Sam Worthington who tries gamely to bring life to the title character. Elizabeth Banks is in there swinging as well. Nice efforts but theyre let down by a script that cant support its own far-fetched ideas. Interview Sam Worthington Nick Cassidy (Worthington) checks into a swank hotel in New York one day has a nice meal and climbs out onto the ledge several stories above the street. This draws a crowd naturally armed with cellphone cameras screaming either in horror or with encouragement to jump. You know the usual. But not quite. There is something decidedly unusual about Cassidy and his situation. He demands to see Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) a police negotiator with a checkered past. Which it turns out Cassidy has too. As Leth goes back and forth in time we learn that Cassidy is a disgraced police officer himself in prison for -- of course -- a crime he did not commit. Movie prisons are full of such people; in Cassidys case he was convicted of stealing a diamond from all-around-jerk and rich guy David Englander (Ed Harris chewing scenery like hes famished). Cassidy orchestrates an escape leading to the ledge where we learn that his threats to jump are maybe not what they seem. A side story involving his brother (Jamie Bell) and his brothers girlfriend (Genesis Rodriguez) comes into play and the ridiculousness starts to mount. The film bounces between well-planned-but-absurd orchestrated plans and insanely good luck. We do learn about Cassidys troubles how he came to be convicted and what led him to become well a Man on a Ledge. But we dont especially care. Movies like this often depend on a certain amount of suspension of disbelief. But rarely are we asked to throw good sense off the side of a building. There are occasional nice touches. Kyra Sedgwick is funny as an obnoxious television reporter named Suzie Morales who trills the R in her last name in exaggerated fashion. Titus Welliver is always a welcome presence even if here he mostly stomps around and yells at people. And Worthington and Banks show signs of what seems as if it could be good chemistry only to have it interrupted at every turn by another ludicrous development. Too bad. You sense that someone could have made a good movie with this material. Unfortunately Leth didnt. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Man on a Ledge (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Man on a Ledge (PG-13) Sam Worthington is the bland center of a would-be suspenseful movie that is too preposterous to generate thrills. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com1/26/2012 Editor rating 1 In Man on a Ledge a man named Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) checks into the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City orders a champagne lunch and then climbs out of the window of his room on the 21st floor threatening to jump. A crowd of onlookers quickly gathers on the street to gawk and point. Police rush in to talk the man down. One detective (Ed Burns) doesnt have much luck. Another one Det. Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) fares a little better. Shes a negotiator who specializes in these sorts of stressful standoffs although we learn her last suicide intervention failed after the guy she was trying to save jumped off a bridge anyway. But Nick is willing to talk to her -- at least for a while. This setup might have been perfectly adequate except for two things Nick doesnt look the slightest bit suicidal - there is absolutely zero chance this guy is taking a flying leap - and director Asger Leth has already shown us a lengthy prologue in which we saw Nick bust out of prison so we know there is more going on here than meets the eye. Man on a Ledge was written by Pablo F. Fenjves who is big on the whole ""things are not what they seem"" thing but not too fond of slow reveals and building tension. The movie lets us know too much too soon so we know that by standing on that ledge Nick is simply providing a distraction for his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and his acrobatic girlfriend Angie (Miami native Genesis Rodriguez) to pull off a Mission Impossible-style heist in a building nearby. And when I say Mission Impossible-style I mean exactly like the Brian de Palma movie complete with a scene in which the burglars hang in mid-air suspended from the ceiling breaking into a room where the floor is wired and an increase in temperature will set off alarms. Ed Harris is also in Man on a Ledge playing a sneering tycoon who likes to gloat when he one-ups his enemies and Kyra Sedgwick is a Hispanic TV news reporter whose only discernable character trait is the exaggerated way she pronounces her last name ""Morales"" (the same way Jane Curtain used to say ""Venezuela"" on Saturday Night Lives Weekend News Update.) The filmmakers try to give the movie momentum and tension but thats almost impossible to do when the audience is so far ahead of the characters. Its an unintentional consequence of the structure the script uses constantly cutting away from the ledge to show us what is happening elsewhere. The only mysteries in Man on a Ledge are the reasons for what the characters are doing which is too puny an engine to drive such an unwieldy jalopy. Who cares? The other big question in the film Has there ever been an actor as bland as Worthington given so many plum roles? This guy starred in Avatar Terminator Salvation and Clash of the Titans yet hes so anonymous that hes the least interesting character in the movie. The energy sags during his scenes. When you look at Worthingtons face all you see is an actor trying to remember his lines. I couldnt have cared less whether or not Nick made it through the movie alive. Instead Man on a Ledge just made me think of an old Van Halen song Jump. Cast Sam Worthington Elizabeth Banks Jamie Bell Genesis Rodriguez Anthony Mackie Ed Burns Kyra Sedgwick Ed Harris.

"Man on a Ledge Review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Man on a Ledge Myriad improbabilities ground this heist film -- 2 starsJanuary 26 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticSam Worthington and Elizabeth Banks star in ""Man on a Ledge.""A man edges along the 21st-story ledge of a midtown New York City hotel. Hes an ex-cop and a convicted thief on the lam straight out of Sing Sing and hes threatening suicide. Sam Worthington of""Avatar"" and""Clash of the Titans"" plays this character Nick Cassidy and it is odd to see Worthington on a precipice without winged beasts or blue friendlies buzzing about his head. The only thing buzzing in ""Man on a Ledge"" are little gnats of narrative improbability.Like the more antic ""Tower Heist"" a few months back ""Man on a Ledge"" exploits populist rage against corrupt bazillionaires as it spins a tale of a high-risk revenge burglary in the high-rent Manhattan district. Unlike ""Tower Heist"" though ""Man on a Ledge"" confines its protagonist to a thin sliver of concrete for much of its 102 minutes. While Nick is up to ... something out there on the ledge a police negotiator played by Elizabeth Banks argues with another cop (Edward Burns doing what he should be doing for a living -- acting that is instead of writing/directing) about how to talk him down. Banks is a skillful actress particularly in comedy but she doesnt easily suggest ""hard-bitten.""You can say this for screenwriter Pablo F. Fenjves story It stays busy. It starts in the hotel moves to the ledge and then swoops back into a one-month-earlier flashback explaining how Nick got there why he went to prison in the first place and how he managed to turn a furlough for his fathers funeral into an opportunity for escape. Nick asserts his innocence regarding the theft of the 40 million Monarch diamond the one owned by a monster capitalist played or rather sniveled by Ed Harris.So many details eat away at our engagement with this picture. Why wouldnt the negotiator notice Nick has an earpiece and a habit of murmuring aloud? Why does the distance between the ledge and the pavement seem to vary from shot to shot depending on whether were watching actor-harnessed action filmed on location or actors doing their thing on a mock-up of the location? Why does the guy in the crowd below holler ""Attica Attica"" as if that werent one of the signature moments from ""Dog Day Afternoon""?Jamie Bell plays Nicks younger brother in cahoots with his fiance Genesis Rodriguez whose preferred heist wardrobe is the Salma Hayek lingerie line from ""After the Sunset."" Anthony Mackie a terrific actor brings some artful ambiguity to the role of Nicks colleague from his police force days.Danish director Asger Leth gets the job done with minimal style and a generally indistinct tone. The supporting players in ""Man on a Ledge"" bring more to the party than the leads and my suspension of disbelief seems to have gotten hung up in traffic while attempting to cross the suspension-of-disbelief bridge from the Brooklyn side.mjphillipstribune.comMan on a Ledge -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for violence and brief strong language)Running time 142Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesResidential Real Estate TransactionsDecember 2 2007Residential sales transactionsAugust 3 2008Find More Stories AboutLedgeElizabeth BanksTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0124-man-on-a-ledge-20120126,0,7566339.column",200,manonaledge23,manonaledge,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet It is generally a fair proposition to accept the basic premise of a film no matter how ludicrous and see where the filmmakers take it. (And sometimes ludicrousness is the point for instance in the Crank movies.) So Man On A Ledge should be allowed to build on the following foundation Ex-cop Sam Worthington sent to jail for stealing a 40 million diamond breaks out checks into a Manhattan high-rise hotel and climbs out onto a 25th-floor ledge all in an elaborate effort to distract the authorities from something else happening across the street. Credulity is stretched nearly to the breaking point here Worthington has chosen the least-efficient way imaginable to prove his innocence. And yet we must generously accept the plan and see how it develops because it may be more ingenious than it sounds--or in the Crank example more transcendently silly than it sounds. Yet as the plot unfolds brick by brick the structure starts to wobble until it finally collapses into unintentional comedy complete with moles aplenty at least two Talking Killers and decisions even sillier than breaking out of jail and walking out on a hotel ledge as a means to exoneration. Man On A Ledge stirs the pot reasonably well in the early going as Worthington methodically goes about what appears to be a suicide attempt but turns out to be a complicated ruse. A star-filled cast of allies and adversaries surrounds him Elizabeth Banks as the police psychologist trying to talk him down Edward Burns as her shifty-eyed (and sometimes just sleepy) partner Anthony Mackie as Worthingtons loyal ex-partner Jamie Bell as his brother/co-conspirator Ed Harris as a cigar-chomping real-estate magnate and Kyra Sedgwick as the dogged TV reporter on the ground. The carnival atmosphere thats whipped up around Worthingtons stunt recalls Dog Day Afternoon which the filmmakers acknowledge directly with a few shouts of ""Attica Attica"" But Man On A Ledge isnt a piece of social commentary and it isnt psychologically acute either when it comes to assessing its heros desperate situation. (Unlike Al Pacino in Dog Day Worthington isnt an amateur.) So the film really lives or dies on the integrity of its plot mechanics with nary a theme to subvert or exploit. And to that end it winds up as a calamitous heap of mangled gears snapped levers and rusty springs.

Poised precipitously atop a high-concept premise Sam Worthington is an escaped convict attempting to prove his innocence in the most elaborate way possible He climbs out onto a hotel ledge and creates a suicide spectacle/diversion that allows his brother (Jamie Bell) to steal a diamond from an iniquitous real estate baron played with a perpetual scowl by Ed Harris. Its all ostensibly part of a master plan as is his requesting Elizabeth Banks beleaguered negotiator but it feels as if the filmmakers have tried to stuff the plots of too many different movies into a single casing thats already overflowing with eye-rolling improbabilities. Despite the occasional dumb fun -- especially with the heist portions -- the leap of logic required to make it all work is enough to leave your brain pancaked on the sidewalk.

Thats where theyd be filing ""Man on a Ledge"" a predictable and underwritten thriller with a cast just reputable enough to get it into movie theaters and a plot just interesting enough to keep you seated even if you wind up being three or four moves ahead of the script. (Even its predictability is somehow comforting just like chicken soup for the bed-ridden.) Its not a despicable film to be sure but its a time-filler at best. Sam Worthington still failing to mask his native Australian accent stars as disgraced NYPD cop Nick Cassidy whos been serving time at Sing Sing for stealing the legendary Monarch Diamond from Manhattan real-estate bigwig David Englander (Ed Harris) and selling it off in so many pieces that they can never be found. After escaping from prison during his fathers funeral Nick checks into a room at a hotel run by Englander and steps out onto the ledge where a crowd forms -- first the gawkers then the cops then the vultures of the media represented by newswoman Suzie Morales. (Kyra Sedgwick makes for odd cross-cultural casting but at least she gets a laugh out of hyper-enunciating her last name.) The police send up Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns) to talk Nick off the ledge but Nick insists upon Detective Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) whos none too popular among her peers after failing to prevent a rookie cop from leaping to his death a few months earlier. As the plot unravels we figure out why Nick who insists on his innocence wants an outsider on the force to be his intermediary and we also see that his every move is carefully timed to distract attention away from the activities of his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) across the street at Englanders diamond vault. ""Man on a Ledge"" tosses in the requisite double-crosses and ""surprise"" revelations but nothing that should come as too much of a shock to anyone whos paying attention. (Heres a general movie commandment When a seemingly dispensable role is played by a recognizable character actor that role aint gonna be dispensable.) By the time the film reaches its climax you may find yourself having to restrain the occasional ""Oh come ON"" when cops suddenly forget everything they know about locked doors and elevators just to keep the story going. No one in the cast embarrasses themselves too much -- although Banks attempt to come off as grizzled and boozy waking up in a vodka-bottle-strewn apartment yet still looking glamorous is worth an unintentional laugh or two -- but no ones going to be pulling clips from this movie for their best-of reel either. While the notable names remember their lines and avoid tripping over the furniture the one performance that sticks comes from Genesis Rodriguez as Joeys girlfriend and sidekick. Even though shes been dressed and lit to look like Jordana Brewster Rodriguez takes a stock character and gives it the zest that most of ""Man on a Ledge"" is so sorely missing. Director Asger Leth (making his narrative feature debut) and cinematographer Paul Cameron (""Collateral"" ""Gone in 60 Seconds"") make the most out of the titles vertiginous possibilities but the rest of the film gets mired down in Pablo F. Fenjves mundane screenplay which adds nothing to the lexicon of prison breaks high-rise heists or suicide negotiations. At the moment ""Man on a Ledge"" is just another forgettable January release. But one day its going to make someone buzzed on DayQuil and clutching a box of tissues forget about their phlegmy cough for a couple of hours. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Man on a Ledge | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; man-on-a-ledge ) Man on a Ledge (United States 2012) January 25 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Okay so maybe after seeing Tom Cruise scale the tallest building in the world in Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol 21 stories doesnt seem that high... but its still a long way down. And Id be willing to bet Sam Worthington didnt do all his own stunts in this movie. Man on a Ledge is a heist film with a great hook a fast pace and a major letdown of an ending. For about 80 minutes it crackles along at a breakneck pace building suspense and tension switching back and forth between three destined-to-converge plotlines and getting viewers ready for... a colossal collapse. The films sloppy resolution isnt just hard to swallow (thats a given for any movie of this sort and goes with the territory) but is so outrageously stupid that it wastes a lot of its hard-won goodwill. Okay so on balance Man on a Ledge is fun but I left the theater feeling disappointed and cheated as if the filmmakers set me up for something great they ultimately couldnt deliver. The premise borrows a little from two of the Die Hard films (the first and third ones to be precise) - that of using a big public spectacle as a distraction from a robbery. (Related Trivia the Big Bad Guy from Die Hard 2 William Sadler has a small part in this movie as a valet.) Admittedly it was done better in the Bruce Willis movies but the idea has survived intact to Man on a Ledge. In this case the distraction is the suicide watch for the title character ex-cop and escaped convict Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) who opens the window to his 21st floor hotel room and wanders out onto a catwalk. This results in the arrival of two NYPD officers Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) and Jack Dougherty (Edward Burns) trying to talk him down while a massive crowd gathers below. Meanwhile across the street Nicks brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joeys girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are breaking into the ultra-secure inner sanctum of diamond merchant David Englander (Ed Harris). Their goal find the evidence that Englander set Nick up to take the fall for a multi-million dollar robbery that sent the former police officer to Sing Sing. Theres a lot to like about Man on a Ledge not the least of which is the no-nonsense rapid-fire manner in which Asger Leth makes his feature debut. Theres not a lot of fat here - every scene either advances the plot or gives us a white-knuckle moment. Leth also injects a fair amount of humor into what could be a grim tale - this comes primarily through the occasionally comedic byplay between amateur heist artists Joey and Angie as they execute their convoluted plan to make it through Englanders security system. Its also refreshing to encounter characters like these in a film of this sort - smart but not experienced. They have a lot of good ideas but dont always execute them to perfection. Sam Worthington has a thankless job doing little more than standing on a ledge 200 feet above a New York intersection while trying to convince Lydia that hes an innocent man. Worthington is fine in the role with a performance thats more solid than his variable American accent. Meanwhile Banks starts out the movie with a more interesting character than she concludes it with - although the opening scene in which she wears a translucent white tee-shirt provides a little eye candy. As the villain Ed Harris is lackluster but that could be the result of limited screen time. He sneers a lot but doesnt have much else to do. The ending represents one mistake built upon another. Although the movie as a whole has credulity problems many of those will not be noticed until afterward (fulfilling Alfred Hitchcocks primary requirement for a ""refrigerator movie""). Unfortunately the final fifteen minutes are written and executed so sloppily that the contrivances and script contortions become apparent in real time. Much of what happens is not only improbable and impractical but nonsensical. The final fifteen minutes also appears rushed perhaps in the hope that with so many things happening so fast the audience wont have time to recognize how dumb everything has become. For a January movie - a time of the year when the studios dump productions they dont feel have the cache to survive during warmer and/or more competitive seasons - Man on a Ledge is respectable. It almost delivers - or more appropriately it does deliver albeit not for the entire running length. Those who are more forgiving of lame endings than I am may walk away having enjoyed themselves.

The first of course is the predictable ""just get it over with"" impatience of New Yorkers impeded by police barricades. The second is unlikely populist solidarity a stick-it-to-the-rich resentment among the 99-percenters whom Republicans would accuse of class warfare. Man on a Ledge is then essentially an accidental remake of the recent Tower Heist with yet another band of blue-collar heroes trying to claw back the ill-gotten gains of an arrogant penthouse villain who only pays 15 percent on his taxes.Unfortunately this film doesnt realize its a comedy. Instead of say Leslie Nielsen in the central role we have a brand of Australian wall paint known as Sam Worthington. His Nick Cassidy is soon revealed in flashbacks not to be a suicidal leaper but a wrongfully imprisoned NYC cop who just busted out of Sing Sing. The poor schmuck was set up by corrupt millionaire David Englander (a bald gaunt Ed Harris) who owns both the hotel and a treasure vault across the street. By threatening to jump Nick serves as a diversion for his brother Joey (Brit Jamie Bell credibly American) to crack the safe that will presumably disgorge both diamonds and exoneration.Its not a bad setup and the script (by Pablo F. Fenjves) allows for much suspenseful intercutting between leaper and burglar. On the ledge stalling for time Nick demands that disgraced NYPD negotiator Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) be the one to try to coax him down. In the building across the street connected to Nick via radio Joey gets busy crawling through ducts dangling down elevator shafts and using his iPhone to otherwise defeat a high-tech security system. (Aiding him is girlfriend Angie played by a Wonderbra wrapped around model/telenovela actress Genesis Rodriguez.) Rififi its not but Man on a Ledge at least provides the pleasure of hearing someone yell ""Cut the red wire"" as if for the first time.Director-for-hire Asger Leth (Ghosts of Cite Soleil) does what he can with the pedestrian material pushing the camera out the hotel-room window behind Nick to vertiginous effect. The first time he slips--or pretends to slip--you gasp but his banter with Lydia soon becomes as predictable as his footwork and pleas to the crowd below. (""Im an innocent man"") When in yet another ruse he tosses handfuls of cash down to the street the ensuing scramble hardly feels desperate--not a riot in a Haitian slum but tired extras stamping their feet to keep warm. Man on a Ledge seeks to be somewhat topical positioning Nick as populist hero opposite the venal Englander (who were told ""lost 30 million to Lehman Brothers"" during the crash). There are also nods to Occupy Wall Street and Dog Day Afternoon but the whole thing plays like random outtakes from Law amp; Order. You keep waiting for Chris Noth to wander onto the scene.With his pickled sharks smile Harris is a welcome presence left with regrettably little to do. Down on the sidewalk Kyra Sedgwick chews into her role as a cynical TV reporter hitting the R in her name--Suzie Morales--like the pull-cord on a lawn mower. Her part is also too small to matter but she and Edward Burns--as Lydias dont-give-a-shit NYPD superior--are clearly aware that the material should be played for laughs. Worthington wouldnt know how to behave if the film were a comedy; and poor Banks after a promising Young Adult-style introduction isnt allowed to goose the script or push beyond the glass ceiling of her character.""You and I have a lot in common"" says Nick to Lydia at one point in the negotiation. He means that both are in need of redemption but what they really share is the burden of playing characters who--like the movie--are essentially self-parodic. In other words theyre meant for each other. We look forward to the sequel Couple on a Parapet.

Between last years ill-received drama ""The Ledge"" and the marginally better more action-driven ""Man on a Ledge"" auds may well find themselves craving a movie in which a man threatens to jump off a building for non-gimmicky genuinely suicidal reasons. Centered around a fugitive seeking to exonerate himself in the most out-there manner possible this cloddishly contrived suspenser is too busy to bore but too farfetched to thrill combining routine heist-thriller machinations with dialogue that often thuds like a body hitting asphalt. Quick theatrical playoff and better ancillary fortunes look likely. Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) checks into a Manhattan hotel one morning orders an expensive last meal and promptly fulfills the titles high-concept promise by climbing out the window. As vulture-like TV reporters and lip-smacking bystanders swarm in the streets below the NYPD is quick to arrive on the scene specifically officer Lydia Mercer (Elizabeth Banks) the professional sweet-talker who spends most of the movie trying to coax this potential jumper back off the ledge. But as Pablo F. Fenjves screenplay too quickly makes clear Nick himself an ex-cop has no real intention of jumping. A flashback to one month earlier reveals Nicks daring escape from prison where he was sent after being convicted of stealing a massive diamond from powerful tycoon David Englander (Ed Harris). Nick is determined to clear his name and his so-called suicide attempt is in fact an elaborate diversion buying time while his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joeys g.f. Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) plunder Englanders vault and prove the jewel never went missing in the first place. Even leaving aside the fact that breaking and entering is perhaps not the ideal way to establish ones innocence ""Man on a Ledge"" is rife with implausibilities and outright howlers. ""How far would you go to get back at a man who took everything from you?"" Nick fumes at Lydia a line that would have been better reserved for the one-sheet. Notwithstanding Worthington and Banks natural appeal and mutual you-can-trust-me rapport their protracted ledge-and-window back-and-forth too often lets the tension go slack. Not much better is Joey and Angies ongoing banter supplying tiresome comic relief as they attempt to penetrate the vault. Director Asger Leth (making a Hollywood debut after his intense 2006 documentary ""Ghosts of Cite Soleil"") does extract a certain mechanical tension from the gizmo-oriented heist proceedings With Henry Jackmans score setting a percussive rhythm the pic makes deft use of heat-sensor alarms security cameras and the image of svelte stripped-down Rodriguez sliding her way down an airshaft. But elsewhere an eye-rolling obviousness persists in all aspects of narrative character and dialogue as the pic traffics in complications but few surprises. As soon as Harris Englander appears eyes all a-glower its clear precisely who he is and what his function will be; something similar could be said of Anthony Mackie as Nicks former partner on the force. Sharpest supporting turn comes from Kyra Sedgwick as a bitchy TV reporter whose eagerness to exploit the situation lends the technically competent pic a measure of satirical heft.

Daily Edition Login to download Man on a Ledge Film Review 600 AM PST 1/23/2012 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Summit Entertainment Despite its workable premise this NYC heist thriller never finds a firm footing. TWITTER Sam Worthington plays a disgraced NYPD detective who escapes from prison checks into a New York City hotel and climbs out the window onto a ledge some 200 feet off the ground. When dealing with a movie called Man on a Ledge there are certain inescapable expectations that should go with the territory. First of all unless the intended meaning is a figurative one it ought to involve an actual man perched somewhere on a ledge. Secondly there should be a palpable edge-of-your-seat peril; that at any moment the individual and his ledge could part company. To his credit director Asger Leth (Ghosts of Cite Soleil) gets right to the business at hand where the set-up is concerned but its in the execution that this would-be thriller falls flat. Theres never the feeling that wronged cop Sam Worthington is in any real danger despite spending most of the films 103-minute running time clinging to his windswept Roosevelt Hotel roost some 200 feet above 45th Street. Thats not to say the talky picture isnt a complete letdown thanks mainly to a colorful cast that has its energetic way with the B-movie dialogue (courtesy of screenwriter Pablo F. Fenjves ghostwriter of the infamous O.J. Simpson book If I Did It The Confessions of the Killer) it has its entertaining moments but it never lives up to that nail-biting potential. The promise of something more could initially lure the thrill-seekers but this Summit Entertainment release will likely perform best in its ancillary life. Having recently escaped from prison disgraced NYPD detective Nick Cassidy (Worthington) checks into the midtown Manhattan hotel and after ordering room service promptly climbs out of his window and onto that tight ledge. Is he really suicidal?  Or is this his one shot to proclaim his innocence to the quickly-swarming crowd below?  And just what is his relationship to the piranha of a businessman (Ed Harris) whos about to unveil his new real estate venture? It should come as no surprise that not everything is quite what it seems to be in Man on a Ledge but the various reveals would have been more effective if the audience had been too distracted to figure out the Mission Impossible-type machinations so far in advance. What was needed was the skill of a Sir Ridley or Tony Scott the sort of filmmakers who can deliver on the sort of tightly-calibrated action sequences required here constantly ratcheting up the tension. And while much of the plot logic also appears to have been tossed out that window and the corny dialogue does Aussie Worthington and his unconvincing New York accent no favors others in the cast including Elizabeth Banks as a jaded NYPD negotiator and Jamie Bell as Worthingtons younger brother manage to keep things lively. Looking to be particularly enjoying herself is Kyra Sedgwick as a tough cookie of a New York TV reporter named Suzy Morales who elicits chuckles each time she rolls the ""r"" in her last name.
