Sea turtles can live for more than 150 years. Ninja turtles? God help us. With any luck whatever steroids theyre taking to make them look freakishly pumped-up (like giant cucumbers dressed as extras from Mad Max Fury Road) will shave a few years off their lifespan. Anything to save us from more ear-splittingly relentless unmistakably cheap-looking movies like this. TMNT Out of the Shadows is the second film in the rebooted franchise about the heroes in a half shell. This time around the turtles are sneaking out of their secret sewer to take on arch nemesis Shredder (Brian Tee) who has broken out of prison to take down the planet in an insulting-even-to-kids plot that involves DNA black holes wormholes to another dimension and blob villain Krang. Forget cowabunga this is cowadunga. Still the Oscar for Most Shamefully Contrived Scene goes to the scriptwriters for managing to get franchise eye-candy Megan Fox into a sexy schoolgirl outfit which any shorter would land the film with an R rating.

Their antics make the 112 minutes it takes to watch this frenetic followup to 2014s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles a torturous mindfuck for any sentient being over the age of  infancy. Produced by Michael Bay -- four words that should strike terror in the heart of every movie lover -- the film is the latest chapter in a franchise everyone thought was buried until Bay resurrected it several years ago. Thanks for nothing dude.

I couldnt find one in the script by returning screeenwriters Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec. Somerthing about a battle for world domination cooked up by nutso scientist Baxter Stockman (Tyler Perry) and Krang a disembodied alien brain voiced by Brad Garrett. Its really just an excuse for  director David Green (Earth to Echo) to light a fire under the shells of our reptilian heroes and the motion-capture actors who play them. Fleeing the shadows of their home in the sewers the turtles bust out eager to let the public know they saved NYC in the last movie a credit stolen by cameraman Vern (a wasted Will Arnett). He had his reasons. More than you can say for this movie which exists only to score a few bucks off the kiddie market. Its action (and pizza) galore for  Leonardo (Pete Ploszek) Raphael (Alan Ritchson) Donatello (Jeremy Howard) and Michelangelo (Noel Fisher). The turtles are named after Renaissance master painters but the movie is otherwise untouched by art. Like youre surprised. Nothing shocked me more in this cheapo explosion of computer-generated effects than to spot an award-garlanded  actress slumming in the crowd. No Im not talking about Megan Fox who is back (often in schoolgirl fetish gear) collecting a paycheck as journalist April O Neill. Im referring to Oscar-nominee Laura Linney who shows up as NYC police commissioner Rebecca Vincent and isnt even allowed to wear a mask to hide her shame. I guess chivalry is dead. So is this movie a toxic byproduct of a film industry that keeps wrapping turds in ever-glossier packages and selling the stuff as fun for the whole family. My advice? Flush it.

Its chiefly a matter of tone but it shows up in all sorts of particulars as well e.g. the villain refers to his destruction in terms of breaking toys. So yes well need to find a way to get girl reporter Megan Fox into a Catholic schoolgirl uniform for one scene but the icky girly romance part need never progress beyond a flirtatious look. And girls arent the point of things anyway what counts here are friends the bro-tastic turtles who must learn to work together despite their differences sure but also Bebop and Rock Steady dimwit bruisers who welcome their transformation into mutant animals by smashing stuff and checking whats in their underpants. ""Aw yeah"" - fist bump. The plot is pure silliness involving a baddies collection of various gizmos in order to open a dimensional portal that will allow the alien invasion to commence...come to think of it the whole endeavor is pretty much the first Avengers just with less-witty quips and less-menacing action.

Photo Credit Paramount Pictures / Nickelodeon advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The half-shelled heroes battle a new villain the space-creature Krang.CAST Megan Fox Will Arnett Stephen Amell Tyler PerryRATED PG-13 Some intense actionLENGTH 152BOTTOM LINE A loud unattractive and most likely successful sequel to the 2014 hit The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle franchise sometimes abbreviated as TMNT ought be rated FFO - For Fans Only. Everything normally considered a drawback in a movie such as the grating characters and the rickety plots seem to be exactly what loyal fans want. ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" a sequel to the 2014 film that re-launched this comic-book property ought to please the mostly young crowd at which its aimed. Its another loud garish movie brightened by a few slick action sequences an authentic New York City backdrop (kudos on both counts to director Dave Green) and an unexpectedly fun Tyler Perry as a mad scientist. Like the first film ""Out of the Shadows"" is basically junk food no better or worse for your children than a tub of popcorn and a keg-sized Coke. advertisement | advertise on newsday Once again our four reptilian heroes -- team leader Leonardo (Pete Ploszek providing his own voice this time) rebellious Raphael (Alan Ritchson) tech-geek Donatello (Jeremy Howard) and sweet-natured Michelangelo (Noel Fisher) -- are distinguishable mostly by their little color-coded bandito masks. Only intrepid television reporter April ONeill (Megan Fox showing skin and batting lashes) and her cameraman Vern (Will Arnett) can tell the turtles apart with ease. Joining their group is a human newcomer Casey Jones (a likeable Stephen Amell) whose unusual weapon of choice is a hockey stick. The plot? Boy thats complicated. The arch-villain Shredder (Brian Tee replacing Tohoru Masamune) teams up with the evil Dr. Baxter Stockton (Perry with giant glasses and a goofy giggle) to create one of those space-time portals that lets in aliens. The real villain is Krang a wet tangle of organs and brains with the spluttering voice of Brad Garrett. Gary Anthony Williams and pro wrestler Stephen Farrelly as thugs transformed into animals (dont ask) provide some enjoyable buffoonery. Theres no getting around the fact that ""Out of the Shadows"" is one ugly-looking movie filmed mostly in the eerie greens and reds of an old black-light poster. The turtles themselves remain unattractive motion-capture creations with splotchy skin human teeth and no lips while their master a scraggly rat named Splinter (the voice of Tony Shalhoub) isnt any prettier.

David Ehrlich Jun 3 2016 1134 am davidehrlich Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk A wonderfully wacky live-action cartoon thats good enough to restore your faith in second chances ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" doesnt just improve on 2014s reboot of the 80s most inexplicably un-killable franchise -- it atones for it. Goofy where the previous installment was gritty and graceful where the previous installment was chaotic this sequel is such a huge step in the right direction that it may be more accurate to think of it as a mulligan. Things are immediately zestier and more playful with Dave Green (""Earth to Echo"") replacing Jonathan Liebesman in the directors chair -- from the very first shot ""Out of the Shadows"" moves with the lightness of a film thats unburdened by the weight of telling an origin story. That sense of unstressed fun is evident in almost every scene even the recap that blitzes through the events of the last film (which is conveyed via a TV news report that plays as the turtles watch a Knicks game from inside the jumbotron above Madison Square Garden). Its been two years since four genetically altered crime-fighting reptiles secretly saved New York City from the evil Shredder but the humble heroes in the half-shell are still forced to live in the sewers hiding from the world theyve vowed to protect. By day they hang out underground exchange juvenile comic banter and eat pizza by the pound. By night they fling around the tops of skyscrapers like weightless CG spider-men flying through the air like turtles are known to do. There are only three people who know of their existence Intrepid Eyewitness News reporter April ONeil (Megan Fox) cameraman Vernon Fenwick (Will Arnett) and the largely oblivious pizza guy who waits on a street corner to surreptitiously drop off Michelangelos nightly pie (in case it wasnt already clear that the turtles are meant to be giant stoners). Oh and also their evil nemesis Shredder (Brian Tee) whose superpower is that hes very angry and also not that nice. Shredder was a bore in the 2014 film and hes a bore here but Green compensates for that in a big way by surrounding the series big bad guy with several of the franchises most beloved villains. You neednt have read a page of the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" comics -- or have seen a single episode of the famous animated television show that was adapted from them -- to appreciate that ""Out of the Shadows"" nails them all. First up is Dr. Baxter Stockman a mad scientist portrayed to campy perfection by Tyler Perry (continuing to absolutely slay his supporting performances in other peoples movies). April gets a tip that Stockman who Perry plays as a combination between Neil deGrasse Tyson and the Pillsbury Doughboy is secretly working with Shredder. And oh boy is she right Stockman has invented a teleportation device to help his new colleague bust out of the armored truck thats shuttling him between prisons. ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" The second -- and most lusciously mucus-covered -- of the four main threats is introduced when Stockmans device accidentally zaps Shredder into another dimension where hes greeted by a super-villain who feels like he dripped right off the splash page of an old school graphic novel. Krang (voiced by Brad Garett whose voice has always been the official sound of pure evil) is a disembodied alien brain who has two tiny T-Rex arms a massive cybernetic battle-suit and a thick layer of slime that congeals around his pink folds. Unfortunately what Krang doesnt have is friends. Lonely and bored he wants to invade Earth just for the fun of playing with a new toy and he promises Shredder a place by his side if he helps procure the missing parts for the device he needs to open up an inter-dimensional portal and zap his war machine into our atmosphere. Its a mystery why Shredder would want to rule over a planet where he was the only human left but logical motivations arent really what ""Out of the Shadows"" is all about. The films coterie of criminals is rounded out by two fan favorites who are finally making their live-action debuts. Dimwitted felons Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and Rocksteady (Stephen Farrelly) are reborn as dimwitted henchmen when Stockman unlocks their ""inner animal spirit"" (or whatever) and respectively transforms them into a mohawked warthog and a portly rhinoceros. Between the specious science that brought them to life the completely baseless reasons why they want to fight for Shredder and the surprisingly sweet gay innuendo that bonds them together Bebop and Rocksteady represent the best of the films bizarro tone. Whereas ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" was a kids movie that appealed to a tweens intellect and adults bloodlust ""Out of the Shadows"" splits the difference and by consistently channeling the same operatic juvenilia that producer Michael Bay has perfected over the course of four ""Transformers"" movies. And if theres any doubt that Bay was much more involved this time around the first thing that Bebop and Rocksteady do after being transformed into massive animals is to check out their newly enlarged genitals and enthusiastically shout their catchphrase ""My man"" Bays hand can be felt throughout and almost always to the movies great advantage. Green deserves a ton of credit for staging a number of lucid silkily choreographed action sequences -- the turtles dont even pretend to obey the laws of physics and their film is all the better for it -- and for infusing the dialogue scenes with that same rambunctious energy so that the film can seamlessly slide between modes. But Bays unmistakable influence is obvious in every respect. The scale of the set pieces reeks of his vulgar ambition and the climactic battle directly quotes from the destruction of Chicago at the end of ""Transformers Dark of the Moon."" Of course when it comes to Michael Bay youve gotta take the good with the bad -- which means that for every brilliant flourish theres a scene like the one in which April stalks a suspect through Grand Central Station by slipping into a slutty schoolgirl outfit (because it just so happens to be Halloween and there just so happens to be a booth selling slutty school girl outfits in the middle of Grand Central Station). Bay has never been much of a people person and the human characters definitely get short shrift in this one. That can work to the films advantage -- Fenwick is a real ""less is more"" type -- but most of the new additions fall flat. Laura Linney is completely wasted as a stuck-up police chief and ""Out of the Shadows"" grows dim whenever shes used as a stand-in for the turtles frustrations with life underground. Fortunately Greens sequel doesnt have much interest in frustrations; this is a movie about unbridled joy about transposing a cartoon veneer over a bleak human world. Its a movie about a humanoid turtle named after an artist of the Italian Renaissance punching a giant brain in the face. And its the first TMNT movie in ages that doesnt want to be anything else.

Thats the extent of my recommendation. Well that and a plane crash scene in the Amazon that is the apex of the movies copious use of FX as narrative plaster. It is literally that ""roller-coaster ride"" the blurbs are always touting and the one part of the movie I remember enjoying. To be fair I was an adult when the live-action TMNTs movies hit the screens in the 90s and Im not especially nostalgic for them. But the motion-capture series (the first Michael Bay version hit the screen in 2014) is a CGI/low-comedy incarnation whose fart jokes and pratfalls wear thin pretty fast. Of course if the audience is kids all bets are off. But the Ninja Turtles exist in that modern-day netherworld of kids and adults-who-cling-to-their-childhood-things. The fairly-uniform CG faces of the motion-capture turtles all look to me like fat ETs (Alan Ritchson Noel Fisher Pete Ploszek and Jeremy Howard perform under digital wraps as Raphael Michelangelo Leonardo and Donatello respectively). Of course they can be differentiated by their different-coloured masks (which Im guessing they wear to obscure the fact that theyre giant turtles). The plot is a bit of a rewrite of the live-action TMNT movie Secret of the Ooze with a mutation goo devised by a giddy mad-scientist (Tyler Perry overacting way past Madea) whos working for Shredder whos been busted out of prison custody by his Foot Clan. Said goo turns a couple of dumb fellow prisoners into the mutant-pig-and-rhino duo TMNT followers know as Rocksteady and Bebop (cue the cheap laughs). It also has the potential to turn our turtle-teens into humans - which is the existential drama around which all the noise hinges. Shredder and his pet scientist conspire to open up a portal to Dimension X home of the plug-ugly Krang (voiced by Brad Garrett) giving this movie the opportunity to steal an invasion-via-dimensional-rift-over-New-York motif from The Avengers. Its not as if TMNT Out of the Shadows is entirely bereft of originality. Somebody (possibly while on shrooms) had the idea to turn the slacker human character Casey Jones into a cop and wannabe-hockey player (Stephen Amell of TVs Arrow) who wears a goalie mask and wields a hockey stick like a ninja. Well its different. Otherwise being a human in this movie is a fairly thankless task. Megan Fox is back as April ONeil squeezed into the tightest outfits modern wardrobe science can create. Laura Linney looks decidedly uncomfortable (shellshocked?) as a mayor whos dubious about the existence of humanoid turtles. And Will Arnett gets limited screen-time this time around as the glory-hogging camera-guy Vernon Fenwick. Twitter jimslotek JSlotekpostmedia.com Sponsored Links See All Sponsored Links Review Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows review At least its shorter than Transformers By Jim Slotek Postmedia Network First posted Thursday June 02 2016 0124 PM EDT | Updated Thursday June 02 2016 0209 PM EDT Always looking on the sunny side as I do let me point out that Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows is a movie produced by Michael Bay that is about half the length of a Transformers movie. Thats the extent of my recommendation. Well that and a plane crash scene in the Amazon that is the apex of the movies copious use of FX as narrative plaster. It is literally that ""roller-coaster ride"" the blurbs are always touting and the one part of the movie I remember enjoying. To be fair I was an adult when the live-action TMNTs movies hit the screens in the 90s and Im not especially nostalgic for them. But the motion-capture series (the first Michael Bay version hit the screen in 2014) is a CGI/low-comedy incarnation whose fart jokes and pratfalls wear thin pretty fast. Of course if the audience is kids all bets are off. But the Ninja Turtles exist in that modern-day netherworld of kids and adults-who-cling-to-their-childhood-things.

Wary of scaring society they watch a Knicks game from the rafters and eat greasy pizza.If these arent the Backstreet Boys then they must be Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles those anthropomorphic reptiles and action-fun stars on the half-shell. Theyre back for an entertaining enough 3-D sequel to their 2014 franchise revival and so is the rest of the cast that includes foxy Megan Fox and her ability to wear a naughty schoolgirl outfit. School will soon be out and so will the children for which this fast-paced CGI exposition is made. Stephen Amell talks Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows (CP Video) Though a sci-fi Earth-in-peril plot is central the films sidebar soul involves purple ooze that could alter turtle-boy DNA back to human.

But the second entry in the rebooted ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" franchise following 2014s smash hit has enough action and attitude to surpass the low expectations that greet it.Sure much of it amounts to a hyper blur of CGI effects. But like the wise turtles say ""cowabunga dude"" which roughly translates to ""if youre 14-years-old youll probably like this.""After defeating Shredder the four Turtles are back saving New York City while hiding beneath the citys streets and catching an occasional slice of pizza.But when Shredder escapes police custody -- he does so in a rather thrilling chase sequence that front ends the film -- he takes part in a plan that involves a mutated rhinoceros and warthog duo a maniacal scientist (Tyler Perry) and Krang (voice of Brad Garrett) the evil brain looking to open up an inter-dimensional portal above New York or something.The Turtles aim to stop the plan along with the help of April ONeil (Megan Fox always looking like she just stepped out of a lip gloss ad) and Casey Jones (Stephen Amell coming off like Diet Chris Pine). Will Arnett is back as the phony hero who takes credit for the Turtles actions and somehow Laura Linney (as New Yorks police chief) keeps a straight face when acting opposite the CGI heroes in a half-shell.There are lessons about teamwork and acceptance and theres a Vanilla Ice joke for fans of 1991s ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II The Secret of the Ooze."" ""Out of the Shadows"" is by no means a really good pizza but if you liked the last film its worth a slice.agrahamdetroitnews.com(313) 222-2284twitter.com/grahamoramaTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the ShadowsGRADE B-Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence.Running time 126 minutesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1X1ROy9 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/06/02/review-turtle-power-back-tmnt-shadows/85328934/,200,teenagemutantninjaturtles(2014)8,teenagemutantninjaturtles(2014),detroitnews

Thats one big dude. But its a nice healthy bulk."" ""I wonder what material is in the stretchy black ninja outfits the bad guys are wearing."" These are just some of the thoughts I found my mind wandering to as the deadly tedium set in during a screening of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows a subpar 3D action comedy featuring four giant motion-capture animated turtles and a raft of human costars including the dreamy-eyed Fox wide-shouldered Perry a remarkably slender Will Arnett and Laura Linney who looks tired and uncomfortable throughout the proceedings. A headache-inducing 135 million sequel to the 2014 blockbuster TMNT OOTS becomes intolerable after about 32 seconds. The opening a swirling motion-sickness-inducing nightmare has the green foursome - Leonardo Raphael Michelangelo and Donatello - plunge off the top of the Empire State Building and into our faces. Then they gyrate rotate fly leap lunge and fall - into our faces - to grab a pizza before settling inside the Madison Square Garden Jumbotron to watch a New York Knicks game. Great - just another hour 51 minutes and 28 seconds left to go. The latest product (I just cant bear to call it a film) in a franchise of cartoons video games toys and comic books going back to 1984 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows plunges Americas beloved half-shell heroes into a new adventure. Except that its not new. Id be hard-pressed to find a single line of original dialogue or single unique plot point. Shadows opens where the first film left off The supervillain Shredder (Brian Tee) is headed to prison after being vanquished by our heroes. But lo and behold his army of nicely outfitted ninjas snatches him right from under the nose of handsome cop Casey Jones (Stephen Amell). Whoa Shredder teams up with a mad scientist (Perry) to assemble a doomsday device that will open a portal to an alternate universe from which will emerge an even more eviler alien creature. The CGI monster looks like a big orange booger with arms legs and really big pointy teeth. The first TMNT made half a billion dollars. Im sure this one will do just as well even though the whole predictable mess with its absurd explosion-fueled action and flat one-liners feels like its old hat from the very first frame. tirdadphillynews.com 215-854-2736 MOVIE REVIEW Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows (Out of four stars) yDirected by Dave Green.

VPCDonatello Michelangelo Leonardo and Raphael in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows.""(Photo Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 2 starsWay to go America. You did it. You spent nearly 200 million seeing ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" in theaters in 2014 and earned yourself a sequel. Thats two hours worth of dead-eyed CGI turtles that look like Shrek if he started doing CrossFit battling CGI monsters while a scantily clad Megan Fox cheerleads from the sidelines.Get extra butter on your popcorn. Youve earned it.Speaking of Fox shes back as New York journalist extraordinaire April ONeil friend of truth justice and the quartet of crime-fighting mutant turtles that haunts the citys sewers. In the 80s comic that originated the property and in other adaptations ONeil is smart and fierce a force to be reckoned with. Here shes relegated to quip-spouting eye candy. In case youre wondering if the film finds a way to squeeze Fox into a Catholic schoolgirl uniform in her first scene the answer is yes of course it does.RELATEDBig summer movie guide (with reviews)After having defeated Shredder and his dreaded Foot Clan gang in the last movie the turtles remain committed to fighting crime and cleaning up the city. Theyre a bit bitter however about not being able to enjoy their accolades. That honor instead has gone to news cameraman Vern Fenwick (Will Arnett) whos taken the credit for the turtles do-gooding. Its got the turtles feeling a bit tragic about their freakish appearance and not being able to freely mingle with the rest of society.Megan Fox as April ONeil in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" from Paramount Pictures. (Photo Paramount Pictures)You know what pairs well with a brain-dead summer blockbuster? Two hours of anthropomorphic turtles grappling with an existential crisis.The plot this time is extra loony. Arriving from another dimension is Krang an evil giant brain who spits tentacle mucus and talks like a cartoon pirate. He enlists the help of Shredder - recently sprung from police custody - in locating three pieces of an alien device scattered across Earth. When assembled the device will open a black hole to another dimension allowing Krang in a plot device ripped straight from ""The Avengers"" to transport his war machine and destroy Earth.Hes assisted by genius scientist Baxter Stockman played by Tyler Perry doing his most wooden Neil deGrasse Tyson impression. Also along for the ride are henchmen Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and Rocksteady (Stephen Farrelly) a mutated warthog with a purple mohawk and a rhinoceros man respectively. Theyre scatological-humor machines and their comedic contributions include penis gags and fart jokes in the Hayden Planetarium.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestAs bad as all this is ""Out of the Shadows"" still manages to be marginally better than the first film. This one at least seems to know its stupid and the story incomprehensible as it is offers more opportunity for levity which you sorely need in a movie with a cartoon warthog picking its nose. Taking some screen time away from the dull duo of Fox and Arnett is Stephen Amell as Casey Jones a hockey stick-wielding vigilante cop; he brings some much-needed charisma into the mix.Stephen Amell as Casey Jones in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows."" (Photo Paramount Pictures)But this iteration of the ninja turtles remains a strangely joyless exercise. The Michael Bay production feels as it did the first go round like a barely disguised business obligation between movie studio sponsors and toy manufacturers.And with audiences too who demand no more than something colorful to eat popcorn to.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

Credit Lula Carvalho/Paramount Pictures In 2014s ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" the title characters on meeting the journalist April ONeil comment with aggressive enthusiasm on her good looks. They subsequently learn that April cared for them when they were just regular turtles and hence is kind of like a big sister. At that point a viewer might expect the fellows to stop hitting on her but this reboot of the whimsical superhero franchise is partially produced by Michael Bay so no. Video Trailer Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out Of The Shadows A preview of the film. By PARAMOUNT PICTURES on Publish Date April 18 2016. Image courtesy of Internet Video Archive. Watch in Times Video >> embed In the new movie April played again by the attractive pouty Megan Fox does not hesitate in the first 10 minutes to use her sexuality to extract data from two men. She even concocts a sort of schoolgirl outfit to get close to a target. Apparently the one note that todays studio executives will not give to filmmakers is ""Think of the children.""""Out of the Shadows"" finds the named-for-Renaissance-artists protagonists contending with both an apocalyptic villain from another dimension and an existential crisis (that is what does it mean to be normal when you are a mutated superpowered turtle?). This movie is it happens easier to sit through than the 2014 film. The 3-D action overseen by the director Dave Green is not wholly incoherent. The production values (showcasing new mutants and many gear-heavy extra-dimensional machines undreamed of in any actual engineering philosophy) are ultrashiny. And there are even a couple of amusing albeit unmemorable sight gags and one-liners. Photo Megan Fox and Will Arnett in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows."" Credit Jessica Miglio/Paramount Pictures Will Arnett is back and game as Aprils unctuous former colleague. Newbies include an amiable Stephen Amell as a hockey-stick-wielding good guy Tyler Perry as a mad scientist and the great Laura Linney. Ms. Linney plays a police captain and sometimes smirks as if enjoying a joke nobody in the audience has been let in on at least not explicitly.""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language violence and other ways of not thinking of the children.

Rated PG-13 (violence). Now playing. Too bad about the Ninja Turtles. In theory these irreverent pizza-scarfers who originated in a 1980s comic book could have been the kiddie answer to ""Deadpool."" Theyre snarky teenagers after all; they speak in surfer lingo and live in a tricked-out New York sewer with a Zen master rat. But this unambitious Michael Bay-produced version doesnt seem interested in cleverness cravenly settling for the usual generic CGI shtick. ""Out of the Shadows"" is a sequel to the poorly reviewed but highly profitable 2014 original in which the reptilian foursome sent their archnemesis Shredder to prison. Here the criminal mastermind with the skateboarder name (played in this one by Brian Tee) breaks out with the help of a scientist whos gotten his hands on an alien teleportation device. Hes played by Tyler Perry whose geekily evil laugh is pretty funny; hes one of the only people here who appears to be enjoying himself. And why not? He gets the most preposterous lines like ""Inside everyone theres a dormant gene that turns us into our animal ancestors"" and uses ""purple ooze"" to transform two dimwitted convicts (Stephen Farrelly and Gary Anthony Williams) into their inner animals a flatulent rhinoceros and warthog. A returning Megan Fox is having less fun as the turtles TV reporter friend April ONeil who within minutes of her first appearance dons a schoolgirl disguise -- complete with a midriff-baring shirt a la 90s Britney. Is this really necessary in a kid-oriented movie? Or at all? Perhaps its sartorial payback for Foxs comment years ago that Bay (then her director on ""Transformers"") was ""a nightmare to work for."" Meanwhile the turtles tightknit bond is fraying. Brainy Donatello (Jeremy Howard) discovers the purple ooze may have the power to transform them into humans -- if thats what they want. Group leader Leonardo (Pete Ploszek) tells him to forget it while tough-guy Raphael (Alan Ritchson) and comic relief Michelangelo (Noel Fisher) long to be normal. Squabbles must be put aside to save the world (yawn) from an alien invader (double yawn) who opens a portal in the sky through which pieces of a ""war machine"" float assembling themselves into a Death Star-like edifice over Manhattan. (Dont get any ideas Donald Trump.) Their owner voiced by Brad Garrett is a robot with its disembodied brain protruding from its stomach -- which looks as one turtle puts it like chewing gum with a face -- not bad for a kiddie villain actually. Will Arnett returns as the narcissistic cameraman Vernon ""The Falcon"" Fenwick while Stephen Amell of ""Arrow"" is a friendly cop and potential love interest for April. The biggest casting mystery is Laura Linney playing the chief of police. But I suppose her theater and indie-film work doesnt quite pay the rent. Director Dave Green (""Earth to Echo"") keeps things moving along fast and colorfully enough to suit the most distractable viewer occasionally pinging a projectile forward to justify the 3-D. But despite the title the wisecracking turtles named for Renaissance painters are never allowed to shine. Its a bummer dude.

Jonathan Liebesman may have served as director but the rebootedTurtles was all Bay spectacle complete with puffed-up action sequences low-hanging jokes and gratuitous shots of Megan Fox. The sequel subtitled Out of the Shadows trades Liebesman for Earth to Echo director Dave Green and while the final result is anything but a cinematic masterpiece its at least an improvement over the original as our four heroes in half-shells leave their sewer home behind to once again defend the streets of New York from cartoonish villains. Returning as the turtles closest friend and confidante April ONeil Fox actually gets a fair amount to do whether shes breaking into a top-secret scientific facility or hacking into a villains email. (That being said there are still too many shots of her walking in slo-mo sexily flipping her hair over her shoulder in a midriff-baring schoolgirl outfit.) Arrows Stephen Amell also makes his debut as the hockey-stick-wielding vigilante Casey Jones and Laura Linney phones it in as your standard no-nonsense police commander intent on hunting down the turtles. Far more interesting are Tyler Perry as the scenery-chewing mad scientist Baxter Stockman and the addition of two classic TMNT foes Bebop and Rocksteady a pair of witless felons transformed into a humanoid warthog and rhino. In addition to Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) Rocksteady (Stephen ""Sheamus"" Farrelly) and Stockman Out of the Shadows finds the turtles facing off against a pantheon of villains including the returning Shredder (Brian Tee replacing Tohoru Masamune) and his Foot Clan. The maniacal Krang (voiced by Brad Garrett) recruits Shredder to retrieve a bunch of dimension-opening machine parts so he can bring an alien warship into Earths atmosphere and destroy the planet or something. As you might expect its up to the turtles to stop them all while struggling with their vow to protect New York a city that will never accept them as the mutants they are. Theres a heavy-handed emphasis on the importance of brotherhood and being true to yourself but mostly the emotional stuff takes a backseat to all the pizza pranks and flaming garbage trucks that shoot manhole covers like projectiles. Unlike its predecessor which tried to turn TMNT into a self-important Bay action epic Out of the Shadows remembers that this is a story about four reptilian teenage brothers who live in a sewer with their rodent sensei/surrogate father eat a lot of pizza and beat up bad guys -- like an empty-headed warthog and rhino duo and a squid-like brain squished into a robot body. In other words it leans into the ridiculousness that is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So while Out of the Shadows may not be any smarter than the first installment (or really all that smart at all) its certainly a lot more fun.

Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times Its ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows."" Better title ""When Really Ugly CG Creatures Fight."" Those turtles -- Michelangelo Donatello Leonardo and Raphael -- are plenty homely all brownish-green scarred and lumpy-bumpy. Half-shell brothers only a reptilian mother could love. Movie Review    Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows with Megan Fox and the voices of Noel Fisher Jeremy Howard Pete Ploszek Alan Ritchson. Directed by Dave Green from a screenplay by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec. 112 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence. Several theaters. But theyre practically cute and cuddly compared to the baddies they battle a rhinocerized mutated human named Rocksteady and a betusked plus-sized nightmare warthog with a purple mohawk answering to Bebop. When those two mix it up with the turtle bros it ugliness times 10 in 3D no less. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Straight from the 80s-era animated ""TMNT"" series these creatures come providing fan service to those steeped in Turtles insider knowledge. Director Dave Green counts himself among their number. As for the fights one starts after the turtles hurl themselves out of an airborne jet onto the fuselage of another flying hundreds of feet below cut their way into the plane and proceed to crash-boom-bam with the rhino and the warthog the latter armed with a tank Which blasts away inside the jet Which then starts to disintegrate as the fighting continues. And crashes. And still the fighting goes on. Are we overstimulated yet? Which is nothing compared to when Our Heroes take on the ranting Krang who is assembling a -- why it looks like the Death Star -- over New York City. Bang.

The Ninja Turtles are back with new friends and villains and copious amounts of pizza. Director Dave Green (Running Time 152) PG-13 Sci-fi action violence. Area theaters. Whoever said turtles were slow hasnt seen the fast-paced car chase and martial arts action of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows."" What started out as a comic book parody in the 80s turned into an iconic kids favorite in the 90s. The 2014 version of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" produced by Michael Bay brought the same amount of energetic action as his ""Transformers"" movies but didnt enamor itself to the fans of the original cartoons and movies many of whom were old enough to have kids of their own. This time ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" does its best to include as much fan fodder as it does kiddie fare with the distinct personalities of the four Turtles -- ""Mikey"" ""Leo"" ""Raph"" and ""Donnie"" -- faithful enough to previous incarnations that both should be happier with the sequel over its predecessor. Going Green (from l.) Megan Fox as April ONeil Donatello Leonardo Michelangelo Raphael and Stephen Amell as Casey Jones in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows."" Trying to make sense of the movies ridiculous plot which involves dimensional portals and purple ooze will probably make your head spin. But the biggest deal to fans will be the new things brought over from the cartoons including the Turtles mobile garbage truck headquarters and the addition of Stephen Amell -- star of the CWs ""Arrow"" -- as popular TMNT character Casey Jones. TMNT hero Stephen Amell dishes on geek roots Arrow karaoke On the other side of the battle are new baddies Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and Rocksteady (WWE wrestler Sheamus) obnoxiously dumb-as-nails henchmen transformed into a mutant warthog and rhino respectively and Tyler Perrys nerdy genius Dr. Baxter Stockman tasked to help the Turtles arch-nemesis Shredder escape imprisonment. New York City is a supporting character in the sequel to the 2014 ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles."" (Photo credit Jessica Miglio/Jessica Miglio) Megan Fox still doesnt offer very much as reporter April ONeil whose brains and knack for getting a scoop tend to be overshadowed by her ability to squeeze into a mini-skirt while doing so. New director Dave Green (""Earth to Echo"") ably handles the type of car-flipping action producer Michael Bay made famous in his own movies. The movies also technically impressive in the way modern CG has been used to bring the cartoon characters to life especially an odd-looking alien invader named Krang. Popular comic villains Bebop and Rocksteady are ready for their close-up. (Lula Carvalho) On top of that ""Out of the Shadows"" does a great job paying tribute to New York City by having much of the action taking place in some of the citys famous landmarks. More importantly the kids will eat it all up like a slice of New York pizza pie. Megan Fox too much tech interferes with brain development As with the best popcorn flicks ""Out of the Shadows"" offers plenty of mindless entertainment and mind-numbing silliness that somehow works well enough to leave even the Ninja Turtles biggest detractors shell-shocked.

"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles review Shouldve stayed in the dark - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles review Shouldve stayed in the dark Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows Jessica Miglio / Handout Stephen Amell and Megan Fox in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" Stephen Amell and Megan Fox in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" (Jessica Miglio / Handout) Katie WalshTribune News Service If youre of a certain age (born in the early 80s) the best part of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" comes after the movie is over when the credits morph into the bright cartoon style of the TV show we knew and loved soundtracked to that indelible theme song. Sing it with me ""Heroes in a half shell turtle power"" Thats the point when you finally recognize the beloved and bizarre turtles that somehow signify childhood. The preceding hour and 50 minutes directed by Dave Green written by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec are just a befuddling and loud jumble of computer graphics and familiar character names crammed into a story thats overly busy but also too simple.One can question who this movie is for -- the nostalgic 30-year-olds who loved the cartoon or younger kids. Its aiming for both; the 2014 reboot connected with audiences to the tune of nearly 500 million dollars so its clear that theres an enduring affection for the ragtag bunch of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles who live in the sewers of New York City and love pizza. This time around the brothers TMNT Leonardo (Pete Ploszek) Donatello (Jeremy Howard) Raphael (Alan Ritchson) and Michaelangelo (Noel Fisher) are struggling with the lack of recognition they get for keeping the streets of the Big Apple safe from supervillains like Shredder (Brian Tee). Theyd like to come out of the shadows if you will though they know their mutant reptilian visages are unappealing to most humans a heartbreaker for the teen turtles who are just like other kids personality-wise.MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR But a turtles gotta do what a turtles gotta do and when Shredder breaks out of prison and starts conspiring with the evil Krang (Brad Garrett) an aggressive and nasty brain alien housed inside a robot body to open up a space portal for world domination turtles gotta go to work. Theyre aided by the fetching April ONeil (Megan Fox) a scrappy journalist and Casey Jones (Stephen Amell) a corrections officer gone rogue.The plot itself is pretty straightforward -- stop the space portal -- but is filled with the chasing down of little do-dads and other unnecessarily complicated tangents. Theres a whole section where the turtles follow oafish thugs Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and Rocksteady (Sheamus) to Brazil to chase down a thingamabob that is entirely unnecessary and just extends the movies already overly long running time. Tyler Perry appears as Dr. Baxter Stockman a scientist and red herring villain who quickly gets shunted aside and Laura Linney of all people plays a hard-charging police chief who is similarly extraneous to the story.The dynamic between the brothers and their struggle over their desire to be ""normal"" are the most heartfelt and resonant elements of the film even though emotion can be hard to buy from a bipedal turtle with huge muscles and a surfer dude accent. Something about that fantastical a creature rendered that realistically tests the limits of the uncanny valley.Ultimately any sass sentiment and personality are obliterated in the noisy chaos of the climax which is a grayish brown blur of flying spaceship parts whirling turtle shells and shouts of ""the beacon"" Its more cacophonous than cinematic and loses the quirky charm of the cartoon in the avalanche of computer-generated violence.

Photo Lula Carvalho Associated Press Ninja Turtles Not this franchises best effort 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Moviegoers cant fault ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" for lacking intellectual heft. The title also serves as a warning. There are mutant ninja turtles in this film people. And theyre coming out of the shadows But if the studio wanted to be totally fair marketing would have added a second colon. How about ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows Youve Seen Most of This in Seven Other Movies."" Or possibly ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows This Wasnt Our Best Effort."" The new ""Turtles"" is a step backward from the passable first installment taking the overblown mess of that films final 30 minutes and stretching it out into the entire 112-minute sequel. There are isolated moments of humor and even charm. The visual effects are at times outstanding. But these positives are overwhelmed by the uninspired whole. The movie begins with the return of investigative journalist April ONeil (Megan Fox) reporting a story as we all do by wearing a series of trashy outfits coming on to sources without identifying her employment shoplifting and then stealing data from a phone. This data from scientist Baxter Stockman (Tyler Perry channeling Neil DeGrasse Tyson) includes plans to open up a portal over New York City as a gateway for an alien attack just like the portals in ""The Avengers"" at least one ""Transformers"" movie ""The Smurfs"" and several other films weve blocked from our consciousness. Everything about this plot involving the collection of alien artifacts and repeated misunderstandings that split the turtle team is numbingly unoriginal. Too often ""Out of the Shadows"" is like watching your kids play a video game -- and not when theyre fighting or doing anything cool. Were talking about the boring video game scenes where the kids are collecting puzzle pieces and asking for help because theyre having trouble opening a door. New characters include young cop Casey Jones (Stephen Amell) whose superpower is hockey a goof that should have been played for humor but isnt. This sequel seems to stray even further from the 1980s ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" comics created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. The half-warthog and half-rhinoceros bad guys Bebop and Rocksteady from the animated show that followed the comics add little menace or comedy. A final note on the casting Laura Linney a three-time Academy Award nominee who should have won in 2001 for ""You Can Count On Me"" is a bright light in a secondary role as a police chief. (""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows Laura Linney Was Robbed by Erin Brockovich."") Megan Fox getting top billing over Linney as much as anything the current presidential candidates have done should scare all of us about the direction this country is headed. The best moments in ""Out of the Shadows"" surprisingly are when there are no flesh-and-blood actors and the turtles are just hanging around. Despite the fact that these are 100 percent digital creations they have more personality than many of the humans onscreen. The best action set piece involves their new garbage truck crime-fighting vehicle which resembles an updated version of the heavily armed recreation vehicle in ""Stripes."" By the end of the film though the fun of that sequence is long gone replaced by a flying Tetris board coming out of the same female-genitalia-shaped reverse black hole that always appears over Manhattan in action movies. Just once E.T. needs to mount his space attack over Sacramento. Our alien invaders never take advantage of the element of surprise. Until that day were stuck with ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows Theyre Laughing All the Way to the Bank."" Your 11-year-old is going to love this film. Then hell grow up and wonder what he was thinking. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicle pop culture critic.

Paramount Pictures AP i By Lindsey BahrThe Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" is a Saturday morning cartoon on Michael Bay steroids. For the under 12 set thats fine. For the rest of us? Its something to actively avoid.Not that a live-action ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" sequel owes anything at all to an adult audience but in an age where comic books of every stripe are tailored to be must-sees for ages 8 to 80 its a little disarming to find one hopeful franchise that is really and truly for kids. Theyre the one audience who will just let the nonsense wash over them. Is Hollywood learning that sequels are a bad idea? This ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" sequel produced again by Michael Bay and directed by Dave Green (""Earth to Echo"") is so inane that they essentially have to resurrect the main conflict from the first when the four pizza-crazed reptiles took down Shredder New York Citys resident bully. ""Out of the Shadows"" kicks off with Shredder (played this time by Brian Tee instead of Tohoru Masamune) breaking out of a police convoy and effectively escaping the Turtles nunchuck-wielding manhole cover launching garbage truck/war machine.The objectives of the bad guys are a little grander this time. Shredder teams up with the mad scientist Baxter Stockman (Tyler Perry chewing the scenery somewhat gloriously) to try to open up a portal to another dimension so that Krang - a truly grotesque disembodied alien brain that one of the Turtles refers to as ""chewed gum with a face"" - can take over Earth. I think. It involves portals and black holes and a purple ooze that can change humans into animals. Baxter explains that all humans have a latent essential animal in their genes. With a swift dart to the neck he transforms the thugs Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and Rocksteady (WWE star Stephen ""Sheamus"" Farrelly) into a warthog and rhino.The plot of course is over-the-top gobbledygook. A conflict-of-the-week done on a massive hundred million dollar scale that pauses from the set-pieces once in a while to leer at Megan Fox. Her April ONeil is in her first five minutes on screen made to wear a tiny schoolgirl outfit that she changes into mid-stride in a public place.Fox once again is Teflon here. She fares fine and better than most of the humans including Will Arnett who is back as the cameraman turned New York City hero Vernon Fenwick. His slime ball celebrity shtick feels like a skipping record. Stephen Amell joins as Casey Jones an earnest dolt whos pretty handy with a hockey puck but who needs a little work on his one-liners.And then theres Laura Linney - three-time Oscar nominee and general class act Laura Linney - playing the skeptical police chief for some ungodly reason.The Turtles actually get a little more to do this time around and the dynamics between Michelangelo (Noel Fisher) Donatello (Jeremy Howard) Leonardo (Pete Ploszek) and Raphael (Alan Ritchson) are not only given more breathing room but even outright explanations too as though everyone involved realized that they werent memorable enough the first time around.You need look no further than the fluttery vocal stylings of Brad Garretts Krang to really know that this is just a more expensive high-definition version of the thing you used to watch in your pajamas while eating a bowl of cereal. If that sounds like a good thing ""Out of the Shadows"" might be for you. But for most of us the joys that the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were able to provide had a definite expiration date and no amount of CGI-spectacle or professional athlete or supermodel cameos are going to change that.The ""Turtles"" are and always have been for the kids. They can have it.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan June 2 Leonardo Michelangelo and Donatello are back along with Raphael and some fun new villains in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows."" (Lula Carvalho/Paramount Pictures) Its telling that 2014s ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" was simultaneously nominated for favorite movie at the Kids Choice Awards and worst movie by both the Razzies and Golden Schmoes. For the record the movies Megan Fox won the Razzie for worst supporting actress that year for a performance that was closer to a busty fully articulated action figure than an actual human being. What do you expect? She was cast for one reason to give fans of the enduring franchise -- some of whom have grown from little boys to er much bigger boys since discovering it on Saturday morning TV -- something to look at besides talking CGI turtles. In the new 3-D sequel ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" theres actually plenty of eye candy including Fox who returns as intrepid reporter (and friend of the titular crime fighters) April ONeil. The action sequences are well staged and the story boasts fun new villains including the alien Krang (voice of Brad Garrett) who looks like chewed-up bubble gum with a face as someone put it and two mutant human henchmen who have been turned into a talking rhinoceros named Rocksteady and a warthog named Bebop (Stephen Farrelly a.k.a. the pro wrestler ""Sheamus"" and Gary Anthony Williams respectively). Those characters who will be familiar to students of the ""TMNT"" universe are only new in the sense that they were not in the previous movie which was roundly criticized for lacking the sense of cracked fun that the franchise deserves. That problem has been largely corrected here; ""Out of the Shadows"" is at least deliciously silly even if it is also decidedly forgettable. Like a well-plated but nutrition-free meal it registers on the senses while being bad for you. Set one year after the action of the last film which ended with the apprehension of the archvillain Shredder (Brian Tee replacing Tohoru Masamune) the plot is set in motion by Shredders escape from custody engineered by the nefarious Dr. Baxter Stockman (Tyler Perry in a performance that makes his Madea character seem like a marvel of understatement). After allying themselves with Krang who hopes to use a trans-dimensional portal to attack Earth with his Death Star-like Technodrome the bad guys face off against the titular heroes. Each of them -- though voiced by four guys youve never heard of in motion-capture suits -- manage to project distinct if less than vivid personalities. (Let me put it this way It helps that they wear color-coded masks.) ""Out of the Shadows"" isnt going to win any awards good or bad. Neither an embarrassment nor a triumph it is nevertheless an improvement over the last film. That may not be saying much for a movie in which wise-cracking adolescent reptiles with nunchucks and katana swords do most of the talking. (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for mature themes and suggestive material. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Michael Bay has never directed a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie only produced them through his Platinum Dunes company (alongside several other companies including Paramount Nickelodeon and at least one Chinese conglomerate). But not since the days of vintage Amblin has a movies big-name producer been so slavishly imitated by underlings. Bays first Ninja Turtles movie was directed by knockoff artist Jonathan Liebesman. For the second subtitled Out Of The Shadows Bay has hired Dave Green (Earth To Echo) to hew even closer to his preferred and oft-expressed aesthetic. The movie is chockablock with low and canted angles lens flares an endlessly roving camera rich colors and Megan Foxs midriff. But outside of an extended Fox-ogling scene featuring an inexplicable costume-change into a schoolgirl outfit this second Ninja Turtles movie distinguishes itself from its Transformers cousins by actually courting the appropriate kid audience. The Transformers movies are kid-friendly in so far as they star the Transformers; this Turtles movie commits even harder than its predecessor to the tone of a big-budget Saturday morning cartoon. Green joins Con Airs Simon West in the dubious pantheon of directors who have done Bay better than Bay has--or at least have done it without betraying quite so much affection for the macho bullies of the world.This doesnt mean that Out Of The Shadows is good exactly--and certainly not as good as Con Air in case any parents have been waiting for that kind of deranged miracle. The movie picks up a year after the events of the last one with computer-animated turtle brothers Leonardo (Pete Ploszek) Donatello (Jeremy Howard) Raphael (Alan Ritchson) and Michelangelo (Noel Fisher) lurking in yes the shadows having credited TV cameraman Vernon (Will Arnett) with their defeat of the nefarious Shredder (Brian Tee). Their journalist pal April ONeil (Fox) works with them to investigate wrongdoing and shes chased a lead to scientist Baxter Stockman (Tyler Perry) who appears to be conspiring with a jailed Shredder and the rest of the Foot Clan. Amazingly this isnt the end of the movies villain lineup; in true Saturday morning cartoon fashion it also manages to pull in Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and Rocksteady (Sheamus) two hired goons mutated into a giant warthog-man and a giant rhino-man respectively; and Krang (voiced by Brad Garrett) a brain creature from space who marches around in a robot body.The chain of evil plans formed by Stockman Bebop Rocksteady Shredder and Krang isnt worth describing in great detail; why explain what the movie barely does? (Among its many mysteries Why Stockman seems convinced that helping Krang bring about the end of the world will secure his place in science history.) Suffice to say that it all leads back to Krang as all evil plots must. Adapted into CG animation (and converted to 3-D in some theaters) Krang Bebop and Rocksteady bring a welcome monster-movie grotesquerie to the world of the Ninja Turtles. These characters arent well-defined or even especially funny. But there is something compelling about the way the movie fully realizes an oozing vaguely effete tentacled brain alien through the dark magic of special effects.The Turtles themselves also probably qualify as special-effects marvels though theyre still a lot more hulking and heaving than they need to be especially to perform such acrobatic stunts. The movie opens with a winding slide in and out of New York City sewers and tunnels as the Turtles grab a pizza and hit a Knicks game and though its pointlessly frenetic (in that the sequence doesnt need to be so frenetic and also doesnt need to exist at all) its defiance of gravity results in some pretty neat 3-D tricks. Their presence might have more weight if Out Of The Shadows better developed another monster-movie thread it brings up the fact that the Turtles lurk in the margins of the city fearful of being misunderstood by its population easy to confuse with the monsters theyre attempting to fight off. But it quickly turns into just another teamwork parable to the point where the Turtles supposed purpose--helping people--seems like a secondary concern.More pressing apparently having Michelangelo cue the kids in the audience to have a good time by constantly exclaiming ""This is awesome"" (His positivity does result in one fun running gag where he inexplicably thinks the best of Bebop and Rocksteady long after theyve established themselves as enemies to the Turtles). Another tilting whirling plane-shifting set piece that happens outside of New York (like the first films mountainside chase) does approach actual awesomeness albeit with a lot of excess noise. Elsewhere the movie takes liberties with its babys first blockbuster approach variously ripping off the Dark Knight truck chase the Avengers alien invasion over Manhattan and even at one point bits of the Mad Max Fury Road score. Even the Turtles most direct rebuke of the Michael Bay philosophy in which they express their distaste for bullies is jacked from the first Captain America. This movie steals from the best though not in a film-drunk Quentin Tarantino sort of way. Make no mistake Out Of The Shadows is every bit as mercenary nonsensical and loud as a typical Michael Bay production. (The pop soundtrack cues may be even louder and make even less sense.) Yet while its not necessarily a good thing to aim this kind of weaponized marketing at kids its also silly and colorful enough to nearly work as a live-action cartoon. It might rot brains but perhaps not while regarding them with utter contempt.

First of all this sequel is a good improvement over the 2014 adventure that rebooted the franchise. The effects are better the pacing is tighter and the overall impact is much more entertaining. Of course there is the necessity to suspend belief -- even for a superhero comic book-inspired film -- and go with the flow of a pretty ridiculous script that mixes sci-fi silliness with the Turtles decided strength of effectively battling bad guys. The setup has villain Shredder (Brian Tee) sprung free during a prison transfer in an elaborate escape orchestrated by his band of gangsters. We then are propelled into a plot teaming up Shredder teaming up with one of the most hideous-looking and bizarre extraterrestrial villains weve seen since the advent of ""Alien."" That would be a multi-tentacled creature named Kraang who is housed in the belly of an enormous robot. Kraangs goal is total universe domination which inexplicably includes the destruction of Earth and its inhabitants which he considers totally insignificant. Aiding the duo is resident evil genius and techno-geek Dr. Baxter Stockman played by Tyler Perry with a decidedly annoying nervous giggle that makes his character seem more ridiculous than is quite necessary. A key plot point Kraang gives Shredder and Stockman a vial of some gelatinous purple goo that has transformative powers. It turns two of Shredders key associates (and former prison inmates) into powerful foot soldiers -- morphed into both a humanoid rhinoceros and warthog. An added aspect of the purple goo? It just may have the properties to turn the Turtles -- Leonardo Raphael Donatello and Michelangelo -- into humans. As the title indicates this film is all about the Turtles being pulled out of their subterranean secret existence and seen by more than their longtime pals and allies TV reporter April ONeil (Megan Fox) and her cameraman Vern Fenwick (Will Arnett) who now is an international hero. As fans will recall the Turtles penchant for privacy led to Vern being crediting with saving the day in the last movie. One of the more entertaining sub-plots of ""Out of the Shadows"" is Arnetts wink-wink delivery of Verns obnoxious handling of his fame and stature in society. One example selling plastic bags inflated with his own breath in order to share his essence with the world. (Wonder why the Kardashians havent thought of that) Additions to the cast include Laura Linney with the thankless task of playing the one-dimensional police department honcho who chases around looking officious. Shes joined by ""Arrow"" star Stephen Amell a cop whose career is initially derailed both by taking the hit for ""losing"" Shredder in the beginning of the movie -- and then being thought nuts for his claims the Turtles are real. Amell is a good addition to the cast of characters and his energy and charm are well-matched for his Casey Jones persona here. ""Out of the Shadows"" thrashes boldly forward through all of this with elements of sibling dissent between the four Turtle brothers thrown into the mix as they struggle to save the world after Kraang Shredder and Stockman open a portal to another dimension that allows Kraang to assemble his Earth-destructing war machine. Despite its flaws ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows"" should provide a bit more than 100 minutes of fun and frothy entertainment for the fans of those pizza-loving terrapins. 1/2 Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by David Green and written by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec. Running time 112 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sci-fi action violence). Opens Friday at local theaters.

The heroes in a half shell return for more halfhearted fun in ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows."" Every bit as noisy brain-numbing and lowbrow as its predecessor the Michael Bay production never strays from basic blockbuster formula. Its fast food entertainment destined for a short run atop the box office charts and an even shorter lifespan in the pop culture zeitgeist. Although the franchise has remained active in animation and video games through the years the heroic quartet named after famed Renaissance painters -- Leonardo Raphael Donatello and Michelangelo -- went dormant in live action films for two decades until 2014s ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" resurrected the phenomenon. At the time some longtime fans took issue with reinventing the turtles as motion capture-animated heroes especially in the context of a sleek soulless steel-crushing action extravaganza a la Bays ""Transformers"" productions. But worldwide audiences didnt seem to mind one bit and the film brought in just under half a billion in global grosses. Even with that success a few (arguably) notable changes were made for the follow-up. Director Dave Green (a relative newcomer whose only feature credit is the family sci-fi pic ""Earth to Echo"") assumes helming duties from Jonathan Liebesman the roles of villain Shredder and his henchwoman Karai have been recast (with Brian Tee and Brittany Ishibashi respectively) and Johnny Knoxville no longer voices Leonardo (the duties are assumed by his mo-cap portrayer Pete Ploszek with Noel Fisher Jeremy Howard and Alan Ritchson back as Michelangelo Donatello and Raphael). Not that any of it matters much when visual spectacle still takes precedence over coherent plotting and the human characters retain all the gravitas of generic placeholders who accidentally made it into the shooting script. The basics of the plot -- a term that can only be used very loosely -- go something like this Shredder enlists the help of nerdy mad scientist Baxter Stockman (Tyler Perry trying to have fun and getting nowhere) to open up a portal to another dimension where the nefarious mutant blob Krang (voiced by Brad Garrett) plots to escape and take over Earth. But enterprising journalist April ONeil (Megan Fox seemingly even more disinterested than before) catches on and alerts our turtle heroes to fight back. Unfortunately even after they saved the city in the last film the turtles are resigned to living a secret life in the sewers and Aprils wisecracking cameraman Vern (Will Arnett the most dignified human here) becomes the public face of their actions. Still theyre visible enough that they catch the eye of aspiring detective Casey Jones (Stephen Amell nothing but sarcasm) and eventually police chief Rebecca Vincent (Laura Linney who must have lost one hell of a bet). But really everything that happens in the movie is just an excuse to pile one CGI setpiece on top of another. Audiences will see cars flying through the air turtles skydiving and an alien invasion cribbed directly from ""The Avengers"" playbook. And they will meet additional cartoony foes including the moronic mutant lackies Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and Rocksteady (wrestler Stephen ""Sheamus"" Farrelly). The turtles are even more central this time than they were in the last film as the humans become deserved afterthoughts to their brotherly squabbling and bonding. And yet the screenplay by returning writers Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec still does little to flesh out the basic personalities that turned these unlikely superheroes into enduring icons (their roots in alternative comics having long ago been bowdlerized by their success as a commercial enterprise). Anyone left unimpressed by the surface-level shenanigans typical of Bay in the previous film wont find anything to change their minds here. The technical contributions are as slick and shallow as any random ""Transformers"" entry and the obnoxious soundtrack especially grates as it veers between cacophonous explosions shrill line deliveries and thuddingly predictable song selections from Edwin Starrs ""War"" to Wreckx-n-Effects ""Rump Shaker."" Originally planned to have the subtitle ""Half Shell"" the sequel instead goes out with the same ""Out of the Shadows"" moniker as a quickly forgotten ""Turtles"" videogame from 2013. Call it a subliminal signal to the franchise faithful that this too shall pass soon enough. Film Review Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the ShadowsReviewed at TCL Chinese 6 Hollywood June 1 2016.

Paully says June 3 2016 at 110 pm If only we could go back in time and stop Lucasfilm from hiring Bay as the coffee ""boy"".. We all would be better off.. Reply IDOC Inmate Search says June 3 2016 at 639 am I just saw it. It certainly felt like an extended episode from the 80s animated series. I dont think it was as bad as Phil suggested but of course mileage will vary. First of all it couldve been PG rated with a couple of very minor tweaks as it seemed more geared for kids than the last one. There wasnt as much ninja fighting in this one which was a bit of a bummer because I love watching the turtles use their weapons and there wasnt much of that. There was plenty of action but more cartoonish. I didnt really care for the Casey Jones in this movie. He wasnt really a vigilante or rough enough around the edges or intimidating and he talked too much. Having an actor like Laura Linney in a movie like this does more damage than good because watching her say ""turtles"" or ""Shredder"" is cringe inducing. It just doesnt gel. In the first movie the turtles are shot with assault rifles and realize theyre bullet proof. In this one a few cops point their handguns at them and they freeze like deer in headlights out of fear. Inconsistencies like that bother me. Bebop and Rocksteady were pretty awesome and probably my favorite thing about the movie. Shredder looked really cool but did nothing. Krang was just as batshit as in the cartoons. Donatello has a lot more to do this time around. The ending felt a lot like the last movie. Theyre high up in the sky and getting their asses kicked by the big baddie. Aesthetically not very different. Overall I had a good time but definitely felt this was more of a younger kids flick which isnt necessarily a bad thing but it might turn off some viewers. The little kid to my left loved it. Reply Occultology says June 2 2016 at 711 am Megan Fox seems to have a terrible Agent. Reply cadavra says June 9 2016 at 339 pm On the contrary she has a great agent. He keeps getting her jobs in big pictures despite her uncanny ability to remain stubbornly untalented. Reply Dennis A Lopez says June 2 2016 at 705 am Geoff Berkshire - worst article you couldve wrote about a movie review. Clearly you did not grow up a TMNT fan. Ive been watching TMNT since I was 4 and I love every movie and cartoon made about them. Bays version is just a newer version of it all and it will continue to be that way as long as movies and TV exist. If you dont like Bay stop being such a hater cause we unfortunately have to ready your anti Bay articles. GO write something you like and are passionate about cause you seem like you hate your job. Reply Nick says June 2 2016 at 811 pm No one cares. Your nostalgia doesnt count to anyone but you. What a sad childhood you must have had to have fond memories of THIS crap. Reply TacoSalad says June 6 2016 at 900 am I care about your Nostalgia ) You are spot on . I Chris says June 2 2016 at 1139 am Shut up fantard and stop supporting these garbage movies. Reply TacoSalad says June 6 2016 at 858 am So cause it does not appeal to you people should stop supporting this . I watched the film . It was fun . Was it a good movie nah . But It was entertaining for what it was and it was a Live Action version of a early 90s cartoon . Dont need to get all abusive towards a guy cause he liked it . X says June 3 2016 at 450 pm you mean like the shitty marvel disney movies you fat tards seems to enjoy? same repetitive crap over and over again? give me a break idiot keep sucking disneys dick loser Responder says June 2 2016 at 1042 am Its because Bay completely sucks and Berkshire recognizes it a 9-year old could direct movies in the fashion he does they are designed specifically for the stupefied and small-minded masses who cant detect intelligence or emotion in movie either because their too lazy or too dumb. Reply TacoSalad says June 6 2016 at 859 am You know Michael Bay did not direct this film ? Responder says June 2 2016 at 936 am How old are you now? Reply nobody important says June 2 2016 at 748 am Oh no an actual opinion that disagrees with yours If you dont stop them from talking you might actually have to think rationally And you cant have that. You need everyone to agree with you or else maybe you might be wrong Horror of horrors Reply irwinator1992 says June 2 2016 at 333 am Im so sick of Michael Bay. His antics are completely out of place in TMNT. Reply Bea of FakeABaby says June 2 2016 at 1236 am Oh boy.

Its a sure sign of summer when the two movies likely to dominate this weekends box-office feature mutants of both the human and turtle variety. Yes its X-Men Apocalypse vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Out of the Shadows the sequel to the 2014 reboot of the popular vintage kiddie franchise. To say that this installment of the latter series is superior to its predecessor is damning it with faint praise but its likely to reasonably satisfy tykes (and certain nostalgic oldsters -- you know who you are). And of course certain male viewers are likely to appreciate the sight of star Megan Fox in a fetish-ready schoolgirl outfit. The film frenetically directed by Dave Green (Earth to Echo) doesnt exactly take its time getting started beginning with a manic segment in which the four hard-shelled heroes leap off the Chrysler Building because well they can. They then proceed to watch a New York Knicks game from the rafters of Madison Square Garden while chowing down on their trademark pizza causing the team to miss a shot after an errant slice accidentally falls on the court. TMNT fans will be pleased by the appearance of many of the familiar characters including intrepid journalist April O Neill (Fox); the smarmy Vern (Will Arnett) whos been treated as a hero and given the key to the city after taking the credit for the Turtles exploits in the last adventure; and Casey Jones (Stephen Amell of Arrow) the corrections officer turned crime-fighting vigilante armed with a hockey mask and stick. The villains include the returning Shredder (Brian Tee); his dimwitted goons Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and Rocksteady (wrestler Stephen ""Sheamus"" Farrelly) who are transformed into a rhino and warthog early on; mad scientist Baxter Stockman (Tyler Perry sacrificing the credibility he earned with his excellent dramatic turn in Gone Girl); and the disembodied alien brain Krang (unrecognizably voiced by Brad Garrett) whose looks are enough to turn children off eating grilled calamari for the rest of their lives. Youll have to turn to other sources to find out the details of the narrative which involves Krang attempting to destroy the world via a magical ""purple ooze"" that affects DNA or something because frankly critics dont get paid enough to give films like this their full attention. It doesnt matter anyway because the thin plot is essentially an excuse for a constant series of action-movie set pieces -- including the heroes jumping out of one plane onto another plane and then landing in whitewater rapids that send them over a waterfall -- that wouldnt be out of place in a Fast and Furious pic. As if to acknowledge the debt one of the Turtles mutters to himself ""What would Vin Diesel do?"" before executing one of his stunts. The film fares best when it slows down a bit and allows the Turtles personalities which are quite engaging to shine through via their amusing comic banter. Theres genuine fun to be found in such scenes as when Michelangelo gleefully marches in a Halloween parade without anyone glancing twice although the joke is undermined by a gratuitous reference to producer Michael Bays other franchise Transformers. Noel Fisher (Michelangelo) Alan Ritchson (Raphael) Jeremy Howard (Donatello) and Pete Ploszek (Leonardo) expertly go through their motion-capture paces and their vocal work is not to be faulted. They certainly outshine most of the strictly human cast which also includes three-time Oscar nominee Laura Linney who may indeed be giving the best performance of her career simply by keeping a straight face during her turn as a no-nonsense NYC police commissioner. One hopes that she at least got a nice beach house out of the deal.

Apropos of a franchise about crime-fighters created in a lab the current iteration of ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is a toxic alchemy combining nostalgia CGI and a bit of cultural appropriation thrown in for good measure. Leonardo Donatello Michelangelo and Raphaels place in todays superhero landscape is an odd one operating somewhere in the space between Marvels streamlined efficiency and DCs foreboding inconsistency. ""Out of the Shadows"" the second of the new ""TMNT"" series tries to incorporate elements of both and ends up a soupy mess -- director David Greens sequel has turtles but not much power. Thats in part because these two Michael Bay-produced movies have left the franchises best elements back in the 90s. The sibling quartet remains a group of wisecracking vigilantes but their charmingly dumb catchphrases are nowhere to be found; ""Out of the Shadows"" comes across as unwilling to commit to what made the earlier cartoons and films work in the first place. The result is not only a bad movie in general but a bad Turtles adaptation in particular and thats coming from a former Turtles-obsessed kid who once named a pet rabbit Leonardo. See Video New TMNT Mutants in Manhattan Trailer Hits Hard This sequel to 2014s reboot does at least open strong beginning with a genuinely impressive sequence that starts atop a skyscraper and ends with our heroes inside the Jumbotron at a New York Knicks game. Once there theyre reminded of the fact that credit for saving their beloved city had previously gone to Will Arnetts cameraman-turned-celebrity as all involved agreed the general public probably wasnt ready to accept four overgrown turtles as the saviors they are. In that way ""Out of the Shadows"" attempts to brood on the nature of heroism ultimately coming to the same conclusion Batman does in Christopher Nolans recent trilogy that its meant to be a sacrifice and seeking out credit is antithetical to the enterprise. (Eventually they get to have their pizza and eat it too of course.) Also Read Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Sequel to Top Box Office But Faces Troubled Waters Ahead As the siblings make their way through the sewers after that basketball game glimpsing a Halloween parade in the process theres the sense of a missed opportunity Leo and his cohorts undoubtedly have a unique subterranean understanding of New Yorks geography and emphasizing the quartets labyrinthine routes might have actually distinguished ""Out of the Shadows"" from the superhero fare it spends nearly two hours aping. Instead we get a ""Dark Knight""-style chase sequence that ends with Shredder escaping police custody in a similar manner to the Joker a retrofitted garbage truck resembling something out of ""Mad Max"" enough infighting to warrant renaming the film ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Civil War"" and an interdimensional hole in the sky straight out of the first Avengers movie. ""Out of the Shadows"" stumbles from one set piece to the next rarely offering viewers much reason to care in between and its halfhearted attempts at moving toward the ""dark and gritty"" end of the comic-book spectrum never land. Also Read Kimmy Schmidt Reality Check Did Chuck Lorre Really Write Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Theme Song? The film is at its best when embracing the inherent weirdness of its source material namely the four brothers ultimate nemesis. Anyone not already familiar with Krang will be struck by how deeply strange the villain is an octopus-like talking brain connected to a robotic body who enlists Shredder to help him take over the world he isnt actually as clever as his appearance suggests. Further down the totem pole but nearly as endearingly odd are Bebop and Rocksteady a pair of henchmen transformed into a warthog and rhino respectively by a purple chemical whose official name in the Turtles-verse is ""ooze."" (See also 1991s ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II The Secret of the Ooze"" still the franchises cinematic high-water mark). In keeping with the proud tradition of casting professional wrestlers as bad guys Rocksteady is portrayed by WWEs Sheamus here following in the footsteps of Kevin Nash who played Shredder in ""Secret of the Ooze."" Other important characters feel miscast from Tony Shalhoub reprising his voice role as the sagacious rat Splinter to Tyler Perry as a power-hungry scientist but at least none of the Asian characters are played by Tilda Swinton.
