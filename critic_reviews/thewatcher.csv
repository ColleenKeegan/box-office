Lack of similar product in current marketplace could work to pics advantage and fair-to-good opening weekend B.O. is a distinct possibility. More likely however ""Watcher"" wont attract many viewers until it reaches vidstore shelves. Despite game efforts by cast-against-type Keanu Reeves and aggressive visual vamping by freshman director Joe Charbanic ""The Watcher"" emerges as a formulaic thriller that plays more like direct-to-video fare than a megaplex-worthy feature. Lack of similar product in current marketplace could work to pics advantage and fair-to-good opening weekend B.O. is a distinct possibility. More likely however ""Watcher"" wont attract many viewers until it reaches vidstore shelves. Top-billed James Spader is competent but less than compelling in the hackneyed role of Joel Campbell a burnt-out FBI agent suffering a mental meltdown while tracking serial killers in Los Angeles. During his last investigation he was unable to catch psycho David Allen Griffin (Reeves) during a frantic foot chase. Worse Campbell also failed to save the wackos latest target -- Campbells married lover -- from a fiery demise. Prematurely retired on a disability claim Campbell moved to Chicago to wallow in grungy obscurity. Trouble is Griffin has developed a perverse fondness for his would-be captor. So the psycho traces Campbell to Chicago and announces his intention to resume their cat-and-mouse game. Not surprisingly Campbell isnt eager to play. Even less surprisingly Griffin isnt the kind of guy who takes rejection very well. As the dual of wits commences writers David Elliot and Clay Ayers introduce the one distinctive wrinkle of their by-the-numbers script. To give his pursuer a sporting chance Griffin establishes a macabre game plan Hours before each murder he sends Campbell a photo of his next intended victim -- an attractive young woman of course -- and challenges the newly reactivated FBI agent to find her before she meets an untimely demise. The trick is Griffin carefully chooses women who are sufficiently nondescript to remain unnoticed among the millions in the Windy City. Despite multi-media exposure of the photos Campbell fails twice to find a victim before deadline. Charbanic a veteran of musicvideos employs a variety of show-offy visual stunts in a desperate attempt to generate suspense. He switches back and forth between grainy video and assorted film stocks and relies heavily on jump cuts slo-mo and p.o.v. shots. Vet lenser Michael Chapman (""Taxi Driver"" ""Raging Bull"") and editor Richard Nord work overtime to ensure ""Watcher"" is if nothing else slick and swift. (Ric Waite is ambiguously credited as ""additional director of photography."") Unfortunately Charbanic often sacrifices narrative clarity and moment-to-moment continuity for the sake of achieving his flashy effects. Pic abounds in sudden actions and jolting images that arent explained until long afterward. (Campbells tragic back-story isnt entirely clear until the final reel of the pic.) But the pretentious obfuscation cant freshen the generic cops-and-killers plot. It doesnt help at all that ""Watcher"" borrows freely and obviously from pics as diverse as ""Seven"" ""Manhunter"" ""The Mean Season"" ""In the Line of Fire"" and ""No Way to Treat a Lady."" Reeves deserves credit for tackling an offbeat role. But his performance seldom rises above the level of a good try even when hes straining for darkly comical effects by bringing a mockingly gee-whiz quality to his line readings. (Truth to tell the actor occasionally sounds like a recent immigrant with an unsteady grasp of English.) Theres a potentially fascinating plot development -- Griffin becomes peevishly jealous of the bond Campbell develops with a compassionate shrink played by Marisa Tomei -- but Reeves does disappointingly little with this element of the killers twisted psyche. Spader is aptly haunted in appearance and stares at photographs with convincing intensity but he brings only technical proficiency to a character that needs more colors more depth. Tomei is stuck with some of the pics worst dialogue -- ""How do you feel about his following you to Chicago? Is it a vendetta?"" -- in a role that calls for only two expressions sympathetic concern and mortal terror. Character actor Chris Ellis makes a strong impression with his scene-stealing work as Hollis a hard-boiled Chicago cop who develops a respectful working partnership with Campbell. Early on Ellis has a terrific scene in which Hollis calmly converses via cell phone with the FBI agent while chasing then rousting a perp. Unfortunately Ellis is progressively less prominent as the pic winds on suggesting that his character was greatly diminished in the editing room. Even so he fares better than Ernie Hudson whose part as an FBI chief is little more than a fleeting cameo. Fiery explosions during pics melodramatic climax are spectacularly cheesy. Other tech credits are solid. The WatcherProductionA Universal Pictures release in association with Interlight of a Lewitt/Eberts-Choi/Niami production.

Comments The Watcher Emotional problems force hard-boiled detective James Spader to stop working until iconic serial killer Keanu Reeves whod eluded him in Los Angeles follows him to Chicago. This thriller largely succeeds in putting quotation marks around its use of genre conventions mixing subtlety and overkill to create a pensive mood that transcends the plot. The detectives frequent expressionist flashbacks and his exposition-laced discussions with psychotherapist Marisa Tomei reveal in increments the history he has with the killer--classic back story whose main points are obvious at the outset. But the movie eschews one kind of suspense to exploit another one day before each murder the killer provides the detective with a photograph of his intended victim challenging the local police and the FBI to find her. Reevess disengaged delivery of his dialogue helps increase the ironic distance a more realist performance might have diminished and the movies few shy attempts at humor are chilling because theyre played so straight. Joe Charbanic directed a screenplay by David Elliot and Clay Ayers. 93 min.

Starring Keanu Reeves James Spader and Marisa Tomei. Directed by Joe Charbanic. (Rated R. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Keanu Reeves as a serial killer? Whoa From replacement player to replacement killer. In ""The Watcher"" a hodgepodge of half-baked visual styles cant disguise the fact that this dismal thriller is all situation and no story. Not many thrills either. Nice explosions though. Reeves puffy but not half as creepy as he needs to be plays a murderer who has stalked a burned-out FBI agent (James Spader) from Los Angeles to Chicago. Its a reverse nemesis kind of thing. Now David Allen Griffin (Reeves) is taunting Special Agent Jack Campbell by sending him photographs of his victims all young women 24 hours before he kills them. ""The Watcher"" is the first feature film directed by Joe Charbanic a director of television commercials and music vid eos who has done videos for Reeves rock group Dogstar. At the end of scenes images go from positive to negative with a great thwack on the sound track. Theres click motion slo-mo blurred images and the most provocative of all video. At first the visual mess seems to be merely the arty product of someones short attention span. There is a method however to the use of video but when it starts to make some sense and gain momentum the idea just falls off the table. The expected follow- through never comes. Marisa Tomei plays Special Agent Campbells psychiatrist. He is a wreck. He pops pills to go to sleep injects meth to keep going during the day and lives in a mess of an apartment that is an accurate reflection of his state of mind. He is as demoralized as the audience will become. After a while holing up in his ratty apartment seems a reasonable alternative to watching the rest of this movie. Reeves makes an effort to give the killer creepy little idiosyncrasies. He talks to his victims in a soft reassuring manner. After they are tied up he does a weird little dance in front of them. Without half trying Spader is better at creepy. The killer is supposed to have a symbiotic relationship with the FBI agent but they should have taken it a step further Reeves and Spader should have exchanged roles. There are a couple of shock cuts in ""The Watcher"" but thats about it. What kind of thriller is this where nothing that anyone cares about is at stake? A pair of infernos provide some of the better moments in this film even if there are holes in this story big enough to drive a flaming car through. One of them involves the FBI mans transformation from hollow-eyed strung-out medication junkie to well- groomed agent. He looks so good they put him in charge of the investigation. -- Advisory This film contains violence. ..

After a while they began to run together into a single montage of Keanu Reeves dressed in black clothes furrowing his smooth brow in bewilderment as he grappled with one metaphysical conundrum after another. In ""The Watcher"" a damp morose bit of gristle directed by Joe Charbanic Mr. Reeves once again dressed in black looks jowly and fatigued perhaps because this time out the role of metaphysical conundrum has been assigned to him. Playing a sicko whose metier is the strangulation of young women Mr. Reeves conveys his villainy by enunciating every syllable with exquisite care and inflecting his utterances with the fastidious sarcasm of a surfer James Mason. Unfortunately bewilderment comes more naturally to him than diabolical intelligence and his line readings aiming for a mixture of suavity and creepiness just sound silly. Of course not even Sir Anthony Hopkins himself could do much with the lines Mr. Reeves is required to deliver ""We need each other we define each other were yin and yang"" he declares at a climactic moment adapting Tom Cruises tearful speech from ""Jerry Maguire"" to a darker purpose. The role of yin -- an F.B.I. agent named Jack Campbell -- is played by James Spader. As any moviegoer knows homicidal maniacs and the law enforcement officers who pursue them are joined together by deep and mysterious psychic bonds. ""The Watcher"" pushes this convention to an extreme by making Jacks torment the killers explicit motive. And Jack is plenty tormented. This we know because he staggers home to a messy apartment stares into his empty refrigerator and takes a lot of pills. He also sees a therapist (Marisa Tomei) who keeps a copy of Psychology Today on her office coffee table. ""Maybe youre just afraid"" she speculates after Jack haltingly tries to explain how being stalked by a murderous lunatic makes him feel. ""I am afraid"" he replies. ""Lets talk about that"" the good doctor suggests. Lets not. Like ""The Cell"" the seasons other serial-killer picture ""The Watcher"" is the feature-directing debut of a filmmaker whose previous work consists mostly of music videos and it is similarly crammed with MTV-style visual effects. The murderers point of view is registered in grainy hand-held video and Jacks inner turmoil reaches us through smeary cut-up flashbacks. The soundtrack swells with spooky techno effects angel choirs and echoey bits of remembered dialogue. All of this moody posturing is evidence of the films aspiration to be taken as what its production notes solemnly call -- daring to invoke the name of Hitchcock -- a ""psychological thriller."" But its about as thrilling as it is psychologically insightful. There are some big explosions and a straight-to-video car chase at the end of which Jack and the entire Chicago police force seem to give up as though the film had kept rolling after the director shouted ""Cut"" This is one of those movies in which the forces of law and order are at once omnipotent -- commanding extraordinary resources of technology and manpower all of which can be summoned by snapping open a cell phone -- and utterly incompetent. ""Its not as easy as you think"" Jack muses about his job but watching him let the killer slip through his fingers again and again you wonder how hard it could be. Early in the movie Jack crashes through his apartment grabs a hypodermic needle and jabs it into a big purple bruise just below his bellybutton. ""Im self-injecting migraine medication"" he tells his worried shrink. By the end of ""The Watcher"" youll need your own prescription. ""The Watcher"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes several brutal killings and a lot of tense F.B.I.-agent-under-pressure swearing. THE WATCHER Directed by Joe Charbanic; written by David Elliot and Clay Ayers based on a story by Darcy Meyers and David Elliot; director of photography Michael Chapman; edited by Richard Nord; music by Marco Baltrami; production designers Brian Eatwell and Maria Caso; produced by Christopher Eberts Elliot Lewitt Jeff Rice and Nile Niami; released by Universal Pictures.

But as The Cell so recently demonstrated little is ever gained by dwelling on the average serial killers motives. At least not in the movies where psychological excavation usually yields cliches involving tortured homosexual desires childhood abuse or a bad church experience. Even in a story as exciting as The Silence of the Lambs the kind of diagnoses favored by screenwriters seem strained compared with the sickening violence of the crimes. But some diagnoses are lamer than others. In The Watcher Keanu Reeves plays David Allen Griffin an aloof psycho (thats giving his blankness the benefit of the doubt) who preys on young unattached women. He likes to study his quarrys routine (hence the existential title). Then he breaks into her home hides until she returns after a lonely day being single dances with her and garrotes her with wire. James Spader plays Joel Campbell the FBI agent who first unsuccessfully tracked Griffin in Los Angeles and as a result has become a pill-guzzling wreck so haggard he makes The Cells Vince Vaughn look well rested. (That Reeves and Spader might have more ""logically"" been cast in their opposite role is the movies only surprise.) Campbell has moved to Chicago where he is being treated by a psychotherapist played by Marisa Tomei a graduate of Dr. Melfis Sopranos school of analysis lots of empathetic looks while sitting very still. And the news that Griffin has come to Chicago too the better to taunt his pursuer -- the criminal sends photos of his intended victims to the cop -- only makes Spader enact migraine pain with even more vein-popping effort. Griffin it becomes clear feels nothing for the young women he slashes and discards; the real object of his obsession -- in a Chuck amp; Buckish sort of way -- is Campbell. At any rate first-time feature director Joe Charbanic evidently feels something special for Reeves if only because the actor previously hired Charbanic to direct videos for Reeves band Dogstar. Reeves is a stiff dancer and he delivers his lines in a full-leather-jacket monotone but Charbanic approximates dynamism by making Reeves a part of the composition -- smoke shadows light rock amp; roll -- while Marco Beltramis busy score tries in vain to suggest Hitchcockian tension. (When hes not running after his perp Spader is photographed so that he appears slack undone.) In one climactic scene Griffin Campbell and Campbells shrink are brought together in a derelict industrial space -- very Diva -- that Campbell has thoughtfully lit with dozens of candles. Well multiple candles may be a universal symbol in movies (and rock videos) for romance and spirituality. But theyre useless in illuminating the deadness of The Watcher.
