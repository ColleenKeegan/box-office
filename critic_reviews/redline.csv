Comments Redline California mortgage lender Daniel Sadek bankrolled this car-porn action flick and loaned out his own collection of expensive wheels for the race scenes. The whole thing is pretty stupid but Angus Macfadyen is watchable as the villain.

"Redline fast cars slow plot - The Boston Globe Todays Globe    Local    Politics    Opinion    Magazine    Education    NECN    Special reports    Obituaries Traffic  |  Weather  |  Mobile Home gt; News gt; Boston Globe gt; Living / Arts MOVIE REVIEW Redline fast cars slow plot By Jonathan Perry Globe Correspondent  |  April 16 2007 ""Redline"" an action flick loaded with cars chrome and silicone is everything youd expect it to be and yet so much less less character development less believability and most unforgivably less escapist entertainment.Like ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" and other car porn masquerading as cinema the array of sexy automobiles (all owned by producer Daniel Sadek ) have more personality and better lines if not curves than the actors driving them.Director Andy Cheng peppers us with shots of sudsy souped-up rear ends getting sprayed with water from long hoses. A few of those even belong to the women.The ludicrous plot centers on aspiring rock singer turned race-car driver Natasha Martin (Rhode Islands Nadia Bjorlin  resembling a taller sharper-witted Carmen Electra). Her dad died in a fiery car crash a few years earlier and to avenge his death and win her band a lucrative recording contract she gets involved with some high-rolling gamblers who bet on illegal drag races.Yet for a movie that worships speed the retreaded storyline and cliche-clogged characters of ""Redline"" made it feel as slow as a 72 VW Bus lurching uphill. Among other diversions we get a kidnapping scheme a war hero (Nathan Phillips) who returns from Iraq to save the day hot moms more dead relatives a psychotic vegetarian (Angus Macfadyen) and the difficulty of finding true love amid all the automatic weapons and slo-mo explosions.All this cartoon color ultimately feels washed out and the film gets flattened under the weight of its own implausibility. Not even the producers Porsche Carrera would make for a fast enough escape from this junk heap of a story. (c) Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

BY Elizabeth Weitzman Saturday April 14 2007 400 AM Ever wish you could live inside your own video game? No need to be embarrassed youre not the only one. Millionaire entrepreneur Daniel Sadek who produced the jaw-droppingly preposterous racing flick ""Redline"" has clearly had the same fantasy. Described in press notes as ""story creator"" for ""Redline"" as well as its ""primary financier"" Sadek also donated his own car collection to the production even sacrificing a Ferrari two weeks ago when star Eddie Griffin accidentally and very publicly smashed it into a wall. (I said accidentally right? Just because this is one of the cheesiest movies ever to detour from the straight-to-DVD route does not in any way indicate Sadek would crash a car just to get publicity.) The story such as it is finds three rich guys - played terribly by Griffin Tim Matheson and Angus Macfadyen - betting increasingly outrageous sums on illegal car races. Among their drivers two stand out daredevil Jason (Jesse Johnson) and Natasha (Nadia Bjorlin) the hotshot daughter of a racer who was killed in a terrible crash. Although the movies artistic merits are virtually nonexistent Sadek does understand his audience most of whom are unlikely to be acquainted yet with two key aspects of the film drivers licenses and women. So while the performances are abysmal and the script bad enough to be inadvertently entertaining all that matters is this Cars race. Guys fight. Girls flirt (and have pillow fights and wash off soapy vehicles while wearing bikinis). Best of all at least for our primary financier Sadek gets to show off the undeniably impressive assets that might otherwise sit unnoticed in his garage. When Macfadyens character solemnly ponders the meaning of the American Dream he naturally concludes it has something to do with cars guns and sex. But if theres a lesson to be found in this shameless vanity project its that money can buy anything. Even a movie. elyzawaol.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Starring Eddie Griffin Nadia Bjorlin Angus Macfadyen and Tim Matheson. Directed by Andy Cheng. (PG-13. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. See complete movie listings and show times and buy tickets for select theaters at sfgate.com/movies.) ""Redline"" received a publicity bump two weeks back when actor Eddie Griffin wrecked the prize possession Enzo Ferrari of producer Daniel Sadek whose real-life stable of exotic cars is featured in the racing film. If that accident keeps us one more step away from a sequel then Griffin deserves an honorary Oscar -- or at least someone at the DMV should remove the points from his driving record. This movie is so horrible that it actually spends some time in ""so bad its good"" territory before getting significantly worse. The sooner B-list comedians wreck all of this mans vehicles the safer moviegoers will be. Despite the movies PG-13 rating it can only be described as car porn. Theres one scene where a shiny vehicle takes up most of the frame while two out-of-focus actors exchange lines of dialogue in the background. Actors are to ""Redline"" what the pizza guy is to X-rated filmmaking. Not that it matters. Other than Griffin few of the main players are recognizable and scenes that dont feature a shiny speeding car appear to have been completed in one take. Even the wardrobe spans multiple generations with one good guy copying Mark-Paul Gosselaars early 1990s fluorescent preppie ""Saved by the Bell"" garb while another borrows the sport coat/scarf/bare chest look of every ""Miami Vice"" villain. All of the above would be fine if the movies badness was played for laughs like last years fantastic testosterone explosion ""The Marine."" Whether he was aware of it or not Patrick Swayze built an entire career out of intentionally horrible cinema. But theres an earnestness to ""Redline"" that could only come from people who think theyre making a good film. The movie is about four wealthy men -- a rap producer a counterfeiter a Vegas kingpin and the stereotypical rich Japanese guy -- who bet on underground races. These contests attract a pretty-boy driver his Marine brother and a hot female racer whose exposed cleavage is the only thing in ""Redline"" that gets close to equal time with the cars. As the writers smack the audience over the head with each development even the characters are introduced by a voice-over that exposes their cliche. ""The war hero -- he fights for what he believes in"" Perhaps worst of all most of the races are boring. While real cars were used theres a clear attempt to make sure the vehicles dont get scratched (in retrospect that seems like a waste of time). As a result most scenes involve quick-edit close-ups or helicopter shots of two cars racing side by side. The old Candlestick Park dot races were filled with more tension. Do yourself a favor and stay home. Griffins 21-second wrecking-the-Enzo video on YouTube is more exciting (and better directed and better acted ...) than anything in ""Redline."" -- Advisory This film contains violence sexual content adult language and an awful band that writes car-themed songs with lyrics including ""You turbo charge me if you like it fast/Cause Im the kind of girl whos built to last.""

A cavalcade of intergalactic speed demons enter a deadly car race in the full-throttle Japanese anime ""Redline."" One of the most visually spectacular toons in recent years pic is a thumping ride for fanboys but the scripts underdeveloped central romance and the fizzling out of intriguing plot threads will impede wider acceptance of this collaboration by helmer Takeshi Koike (""Animatrix World Record"") and scripter-designer Katsuhito Ishii (director of ""Funky Forest The First Contact""). Robust biz can be expected (pic opened Oct. 9 in Japan) and turbo-charged worldwide ancillary seems assured. Manga Entertainment plans a limited theatrical release Stateside in 2011. Produced by brand-name outfit Madhouse pic is a triumph of design and technical execution. Showing the influence of Western graphic novels and the work of French comic artist Moebius (aka Jean Giraud) the visuals have a distinctly different look from that of traditional 2D Japanese animation. Most eye-catching is the elasticity of moving objects Cars buildings and hulking mechanical monsters are bent and stretched in marvelous ways. Playing like a twisted combo of ""Death Race 2000"" ""Speed Racer"" and a 50s hot-rod movie on steroids pic opens with a dazzling 11-minute pre-credits sequence showing competitors vying for berths in Redline an illegal no-holds-barred road race. The main protag and one of the few human characters in a freakish gallery of cyborgs robots and animal-human hybrids is J.P. (voiced by Takuya Kimura) an ultra-cool Redline contender sporting a pompadour big enough to put the Leningrad Cowboys coiffures to shame. Once jailed for race-fixing hes told by alligator-skinned mechanic/manager Frisbee (Tadanobu Asano) to follow betting-syndicate orders on the big day. Story idles long enough to establish that J.P. secretly loves race rival Sonoshee (Yuu Aoi) a crowd favorite who watches TV topless and feels ""wheels are my only love."" But the hyperactive screenplay cant commit to much more than a few longing glances and a perfunctory clinch when the checkered flag falls. The quest for speed at the expense of story cohesion is nowhere more evident than in the lead-up to Redline on Roboworld a military-run planet that has denied permission for the event and promised death to all competitors. At this point a batch of new drivers is hustled through the frame with few making a lasting impression and juicy subplots involving Roboworlds disaffected workers are allowed to fade away. Biggest head-scratcher is Princess Supergrass (Monako Hisa) a charismatic figure who drifts in and out of the picture and seems to be some sort of spiritual supporter of Redline. But action is the name of the game and the final reel does not disappoint. The race to the finish line is genuinely astounding with maniacal drivers and their heavily armed autos melding into fearsome hunks of metal and flesh. HD rendering of candy-colored visuals is first class. James Shimojis crunching techno score dominates with jazz and disco music breaking up the barrage at well-timed intervals.
