Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Victor Frankenstein and Sparky have a special bond in ""Frankenweenie.""Story highlightsA boy who loses his dog brings him back in ""Frankenweenie""Film is based on a short done by director Tim Burton More sensitive children may find the gothic pet cemetery upsettingTim Burtons most enjoyable movie in a long time ""Frankenweenie"" suggests this improbable blockbuster director is at his best when hes playing to an audience of one himself. Its never hard to spot Burtons signature the baroque ghoulish visuals macabre humor and topsy-turvy morality are always front and center. Johnny Depp is usually in there somewhere too. But lately Burton has seemed more like a stylist or a decorator than a director. Though his recent movies retain his signature style and visual panache they seem to lack compelling characters and stories. ""Frankenweenie"" is different. Theres a direct emotional connection. This time its personal. Its also perfectly scaled. JUST WATCHEDFilm reviews Taken 2 FrankenweenieReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFilm reviews Taken 2 Frankenweenie 0517John Augusts witty screenplay is based on a short film Burton came up with nearly 30 years ago the story of a boy who plays Frankenstein to try to revive his dead dog. The running time has stretched by more than 80 minutes but thats still the essence of the new film a lustrous black and white 3D stop-motion animation that doubles as a love letter to old horror movies and a classic boy-and-his-dog story. Victor (voiced by Charlie Tahan) is an introverted youngster but also an ingenious kid who likes to make monster movies starring his best friend Sparky. Encouraged by his dad to get out and play some ball with the other kids Victor enjoys an unexpected moment of glory when he hits a home run. But triumph turns to tragedy when Sparky chases the ball into the street and is struck and killed by a car. And that would be that except that Victors new teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau) inspires him to think big for the science fair; and then there are the electrical storms that are a peculiarity to this otherwise normal small town. Reveling in the expressionist shadowy style of early sound films Burton doesnt quite match James Whales 1930 original ""Frankenstein"" in the resurrection scene but he does have a lot of fun crafting a contemporary echo chamber in which Victors classmates are shrunken clones of old Universal creature feature stalwarts. One kid is a gap-toothed hunchbacked Ygor; another is a sinisterly cerebral Asian; then theres the weird girl who thinks her kittys litter carries evil portent. Creepy as the kids are the parents are worse transforming into a lynch mob when their little darlings start taking too much interest in science. (They do have a point though When several assignments get out of hand the towns parade turns is crashed by a group of rampaging monsters.) But Victor is a fine hero immediately a more sympathetic figure than his famous namesake and the patched-up Sparky has personality -- and limbs -- to spare. In fact bits keeping dropping off and when he takes a drink he leaks a little but its nothing Victor cant fix. After ""Paranorman"" ""Hotel Transylvania"" and ""Frankenweenie"" it appears Hollywood has pretty much got the family horror category covered. More sensitive children may find the gothic pet cemetery upsetting and freak out at the violent climax. Burtons film should appeal most to mom and dad anyone with a soft spot for Boris Karloff and twisted teens looking for ideas to reanimate their own science projects. Just add relish.

Disney What did you do this Columbus Day weekend? Unless you are a significant statistical outlier the answer is not ""went to see Frankenweenie."" Tim Burtons black and white stop-motion remake of his own 1984 short took in just 11.4 million at the box office good for a floppish fifth place. For comparisons sake this is barely one-third the first-weekend haul of Burtons profoundly mediocre Dark Shadows and a hair under a 10th that of his utterly egregious Alice in Wonderland. If one adjusts for inflation (and perhaps even if one doesnt) Frankenweenie is on track to be the second-least popular of all Burtons 16 feature films. The very reasons audiences have failed to flock to the film are the reasons they ought to do so. Which is a shame because its silly title notwithstanding Frankenweenie is Burtons best film since 1994s Ed Wood (perhaps not coincidentally his biggest box-office bomb) or even 1990s Edward Scissorhands. Yes this boy-and-his-undead-dog flick is a tricky sell in any number of ways. Layering the burden of black and white cinematography on top of the already niche taste of stop-motion animation was a substantial gamble. And despite an ultimately happy ending the movie--in which the lovable titular hound dies not once but twice--may at times prove emotionally fraught for younger viewers. (I saw it with my own kids seven and nine years old and there was more than a touch of sobbing.) But the very reasons audiences have failed to flock to Frankenweenie are the reasons they ought to do so. Visually the movie is an absolute treat rich yet uncluttered wonderfully evocative of the classic monster films (Frankenstein and its Universal Horror brethren in particular but ranging outward far enough to encompass Godzilla and Gremlins) to which it offers playful homage. I didnt see the film in 3D (let alone 3D IMAX) and it was the first occasion in a good while when I regretted opting for bi-dimensionality.As for the weepiness factor it was (for me if not necessarily my kids) a pleasant surprise. For all his technical mastery Burton is a chilly clinical director--a trait that has only been accentuated by his recent projects with Johnny Depp which have come to feel like an extended exercise in weirdo one-upsmanship. Its ironic that one needs to go back to Burtons earliest collaborations with Depp (again the two Edwards Scissorhands and Woods) to find the last protagonists for whom the director managed to convey genuine affection. MORE ON FILM ""V/H/S"" Is There Life Left in Found-Footage Horror? The Subtle Mastery of The Master Maybe Prometheus Would Have Been Better Without Any People in It How to Explain the Disastrous The Paperboy To that all-too-brief list may now be added Sparky the adorably reanimated canine hero of Frankenweenie (""voiced"" in another clever nod by Frank Welker the mouth behind Scoobie Doo among many others). The tale is a simple one. After Sparky is run over by a car in the nameless suburb he calls home his odd but amiable teenage owner Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) works his way through the customary familial script a touch of grave robbery; some imprecise needlework; the donning of goggles and rubber gloves; a platform lifted skyward in the midst of a thunderstorm; and zap Sparky lives (unlives?) up to his name. When a few other kids in Victors class--all of them eager to win the upcoming science fair--learn his secret an arms race of catastrophic pet resurrections ensues. As noted Frankenweenie occupies an awkward audience-space a sure thing neither for kids nor adults but (forgive me) pure catnip for those like myself who find themselves at the intersection of its particular cinematic Venn diagram. Though the movie sags a bit in the middle when Sparky finds himself temporarily confined to the attic the early sequences and the late ones (culminating naturally in a showdown at a burning windmill) are a marvel knowing and touching in equal measure. The performances (several of them courtesy of Catherine OHara and Martin Short who each voice multiple characters) are all good and in one case exceptional Martin Landau--whose last significant Burton role as Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood netted him an Oscar--steals every one of his scenes as the notably Vincent-Price-inflected science teacher Mr. Rzykruski. But in the end Frankenweenie is the story of Sparky and the boy who clearly loves him so. And with all due respect to young Victor that boys name is Tim.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings."" Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

Its the story of Victor an awkward schoolboy and a vague alter ego of the filmmakers younger self who brings his dead dog Sparky back to life with the help of lightning. Its Frankenstein softened and reimagined in the postwar American suburbs and it has the gentle stamp all over it of the mid-century American horror movies that Burton grew up on. Its a kids film but one that possesses a delicious sense of the macabre and plays with welcome messages about creativity reason and the search for knowledge rubbing up against conservatism and dogma. Victor has to fight to realise his science project in the face of philistinism and a gym teacher who declares Sometimes knowing too much is the problem. For Burton the project is a fleshing out of a short film he made back in 1984 although this time he tells the story as a black-and-white stop-motion cartoon in 3D a form that brings with it a simplicity and restraint lacking in his mega-budget live-action affairs. The craft is seductive characters are realised with compelling detail from Victors oddball friend Edgar with his oversized teeth and spindly legs to his terrifying eastern European science teacher Mr Rzykruski.The big tease is that by promoting the supremacy of science Frankenweenie takes a sideswipe at creationists - but it does so by reshaping the story of the ultimate freaky creator. Burton might not like square teachers messing with our minds but young inventors rewriting the rules of nature with a little imagination will do just fine.Its Burtons most pleasurable film in a long while and surely his most personal. It descends into a final section of anarchic buffoonery but this is a Tim Burton film with something to say. And thats a rare and precious thing.

In 1984 Tim Burton made a short ""Frankenweenie."" Disney fired him for wasting money and potentially scaring children. Now in 2012 Burtons made a full-length 3-D ""Frankenweenie."" And Disneys proudly putting it in as many theaters as they can. Has Tim Burton changed or have they? Luckily its them -- and possibly a lot of us. Burtons worship of old genre actors his delicious sense of the macabre and his anti-Spielbergian vision of the suburbs as a place filled with childhood angst and pitiless sunlight have somehow gone ... mainstream. And were the richer and weirder for it. The new ""Frankenweenie"" -- which is a stop-motion film now instead of live-action and Burtons best work in years -- shares the same basic plot as the original. A young boys beloved pet dog dies. What to do? Well dig him up snap some electrodes to him and give him a jolt of electricity to bring him back to life of course. Naturally these things never quite work out the way we expect. And this time Burton really raises the ante with a monster rally of a plot that adds several additional fiends and layers of movie memories. The stop-motion animation -- a favorite tool of Burtons -- is given loving attention and the character design is full of terrific touches such as the hulking flat-topped schoolmate who looks a bit like a certain man-made monster. And the black-and-white photography perfectly evokes the creepy old classics. Glen Rocks Charlie Tahan capably provides the voice of young Victor Frankenstein and Catherine OHara and Martin Short are his parents (and a few other characters too). Winona Ryder an early Burton collaborator is the weird next-door neighbor girl (of course) and Martin Landau is an eccentric but galvanizing science teacher. But the one person who gives real voice to this movie -- his own special voice -- is Burton as he recalls a distant world. You know that long-gone cul-de-sac paradise of the suburbs? Those wonderful summer days that wouldnt end full of fireflies and first kisses and extra innings and adventures that were only a bike ride away? Yeah well forget about it. Instead Burton conjures up a land of featureluess houses on manicured streets and parents who dont know why you dont want to play outside on ""this gorgeous day"" -- and the horror films on ""The 430 Movie"" that were the reason. (""But Mom its Vincent Price week"") That was Burtons childhood and while now he may be a multimillionaire good pal of Johnny Depp and live-in companion to Bellatrix Lestrange hes still that pale owl-eyed kid who grew up worshipping old monster movies. Of course some would say in this era of chainsaw killers and ""found footage"" ghosts theres little place for the truly Gothic creatures who haunt the cemetery of our memories. That in the Monsters own words they belong dead. But Tim Burton keeps them deliriously deliciously alive. Ratings note The film contains a few scares and some gruesome images. Frankenweenie (PG) Disney (87 min.) Directed by Tim Burton. With the voices of Charlie Tahan Winona Ryder Catherine OHara Martin Short Martin Landau. Now playing in New Jersey.

Frankenweenie (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Frankenweenie (PG) Tim Burtons loving funny ode to vintage horror movies is a wonder. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com10/5/2012 Editor rating 3.5 Heres how good Tim Burtons Frankenweenie is Its got enough juice to jolt the bad taste of Dark Shadows right out of your system. More Beetlejuice than Alice in Wonderland more Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands than Planet of the Apes this delightfully twisted story about a boy and his (dead) dog showcases precisely what Burton excels at blending the macabre and the heartfelt in a perfect if oddball union. Based on a short film Burton made in 1984 Frankenweenie gets fleshed out -- so to speak -- without ever nearing the point that it feels stretched. The story focuses on young Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan who played Zac Efrons little brother in Charlie St. Cloud). Victor is an outcast really; he has loving parents (voiced by Martin Short and Catherine OHara) but not many friends. He loves science and making monster movies and most of all his dog Sparky. When Sparky is accidentally killed by a car the distraught Victor does what any self-respecting budding genius would do (in a Tim Burton movie anyway) Emboldened by his bizarre teacher Mr. Ryzkruski (Martin Landau) and an experiment involving a dead frog and electricity Victor sets up a Rube Goldberg-style laboratory in the attic and uses a bolt of lightning to reanimate his best friend. Everything is fine more or less until a classmate spots the revived Sparky -- who sports a comic array of stitches and is prone to casually scratch off an ear -- and blabs to the other science whizzes in class. Pretty soon the other kids are digging up their dead and decaying pets in hopes of bringing them back to life to win the school science fair only this time the consequences are monstrous -- and hilarious. Burton has said that Frankenweenie is a personal movie -- Sparky was inspired by the dog he had as a child he says -- and the film feels personal in every scene despite its outlandish premise. That feeling is aided by the terrific stop-motion animation which gives these imaginatively designed characters dimension and heft. Filmed in black and white the movie riffs on the classic Frankenstein throughout of course -- right down to the bolts in Sparkys neck and the climax during which hes chased by angry torch-wielding townspeople. But there are homages to other classic monster films too and they flit by almost too quickly to count. Burton even gives a nod to his own films by casting the great Landau (who won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood) as Mr. Ryzkruski and Winona Ryder (Beetlejuice Edward Scissorhands) as Elsa van Helsing Victors pre-teen Goth next door neighbor. Frankenweenie is a monster movie first and foremost (though its never truly scary even when mischievous sea monkeys come to life to wreak havoc on the town) and its rather pointed message about the importance of science is thoughtful and topical. But what makes it special is the touching relationship between Victor and Sparky. Even the most stoic pet owner cant help but feel a twinge at Victors love for his canine sidekick and that emotion buoys all the humor. The best thing about an animated monster movie with this much heart is Its alive. In the best possible way. Voices Winona Ryder Catherine OHara Martin Landau Martin Short Charlie Tahan.

Frankenweenie Year 2012 Director Tim Burton Studio Walt Disney Pictures Actors Catherine OHara Martin Short Martin Landau Charlie Tahan Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The grownups think hes strange this quiet boy who may be a genius or a menace. He makes bizarre home movies about his beloved pit bull terrier and when the creature is killed he resolves to bring him back to life reanimation through animation. That is the plot of Frankenweenie -- and the story of the young Tim Burton in his first stint at Disney in the early 1980s. Like a few other Mouse House rebels (John Lasseter Brad Bird) Burton felt his imagination was being stifled by a timid hierarchy in bondage to the glorious past. He was allowed to make a 29-minute live-action film Frankenweenie but when early audiences found its preoccupation with a pets death unsuitable for kids execs shelved the movie. They must have been wondering ""What would Walt do?"" before the answer came back ""Fire him"" Score that decision as a loss for Disney and freedom for the 26-year-old director who went on to create weird worlds elsewhere -- in Pee-wees Big Adventure Beetlejuice Batman Edward Scissorhands -- and back at Disney The Nightmare Before Christmas Ed Wood and Alice in Wonderland. (MORE TIME Review Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland) The passage of time and a few changes in administrations -- not to mention the billion-dollar worldwide gross for Alice -- can heal all wounds. So heres a feature-length Frankenweenie rendered in the stop-motion-animation technique used in Nightmare and Burtons 2005 Corpse Bride. This 3-D black-and-white ""family"" comedy is the years most inventive endearing animated feature. In the suburban town of New Holland the boy Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan who was excellent as Natalie Portmans stepson in The Other Woman) lives with his doting if clueless parents Ben (Martin Short) and Susan (Catherine OHara). Shy and studious Victor loves tinkering in the attic and makes little movies starring his beloved Sparky as the monster and the savior. When Sparky is run over by a car Victor is devastated by the loss of his one true friend -- until he watches his science teacher (Martin Landau) make a dead frog move with the application of electric shocks. After digging up Sparky from his resting place in the local pet cemetery Victor borrows all of his moms household appliances takes them to the attic and plugs them in. At the convenient approach of a lightning storm he uses kite power to raise the late Sparky to the sizzling heavens and voila we have a full-fledged Frankenstein pastiche. (MORE TIME Review Tim Burtons Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street) When dragged to the funerals of their grandparents children may get a taste of mortality -- the casket the relatives in black the sepulchral whispers -- but their first real brush with death is likely to come at the passing of an adored pet. With Sparkys demise Victor feels as if he has died too. Yet this death gives the boy a sacred or unholy mission. Victor has to believe not only that Sparky can be revived the way the dead so often are in the Hollywood stories he has imitated in his home movies but also that he a science whiz is the ordained reanimator. Frankenweenies message to the young children should play with dead things. (Maybe the drab minds at Disney three decades ago had a point. We wouldnt recommend this film to kids under say 6.) This being a Burton production Victor is not alone in his precocious necrophilia. Virtually all the other kids in his class have a touch of the macabre from Edgar ""E."" Gore (featuring a precisely hilarious vocal performance from Atticus Shaffer) a hunchback who must have been raised on Peter Lorre movies to the child known only as Weird Girl (OHara again) whose creepy cat Mr. Whiskers will undergo his own terrifying transformation. The whole student body could be the spawn of the clown monsters in Hotel Transylvania but with the special gravity of bright sad children. Even Elsa (Winona Ryder) Victors pretty love interest next door has a hankering for the grave. When told by her uncle Mayor Burgermeister (Short again) that ""a lot of girls would kill to be in your place"" Elsa curtly replies ""Id welcome death."" (MORE TIME Review Tim Burtons Dark Shadows) Burtons first movie project now his latest fits into his career-long fascination with warped domesticity. He sees in any family a dialectic between the weird and the normal -- and really who knows which is which? In Beetlejuice Edward Scissorhands Big Fish Corpse Bride and Dark Shadows family members juggle the deadly and the fantastic; Ed Wood and Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street create improvised families united in their search for art or revenge. Like Edward Scissorhands -- the Johnny Depp character with the cutlery cuticles who is adopted by well-meaning strangers into a suburban home -- Victor feels estranged from the adults in his house as well as the rest of New Holland not by animosity but by his belief that he is a separate species which he is a brilliant kid with a mortal secret. So he necessarily stumbles into the family of classmates who want to reanimate their pets too. This leads to a third act of blended pastiches Frankenstein Gamera Gremlins and a dozen other horror-movie icons spindled mutilated and treasured. For instance when Persephone Elsas poodle goes nose to nose with the revived Sparky she gets an electric shock that leaves her hair with a zigzaggy white streak like Elsa Lanchesters in the 1935 James Whale classic Bride of Frankenstein. (MORE TIME Review Matthew Bournes Ballet Edward Scissorhands) The whole movie is so confident it seems effortless. Yet the stop-motion process is agonizing puppets placed in miniature sets are moved a fraction of an inch for every frame of film. Its work for childlike obsessives for labor in the service of love and the puppeteers at Mackinnon amp; Saunders were up to the challenge. One imagines them as kids helping Victor -- or decades ago Burton -- make his first movies. Frankenweenie has that youthful verve and the ghoulishness of strange kids who will some day be eccentric creators. This movie is an attic experiment for its makers to be proud of and for audiences to give a fond pat on the head.

Starring Catherine OHara Martin Short Martin Landau Charlie Tahan Atticus Shaffer Robert Capron Conchata Ferrell Winona Ryder Director Tim Burton Running time 127 Release Opened Oct 5 2012  Editorial Review One deliciously dark taleBy Michael OSullivanFriday October 5 2012During the next month Americans will be called upon to make a choice between two very distinct visions. No not Obama vs. Romney. Im talking about ""Frankenweenie"" vs. ""Hotel Transylvania."" The two animated monster-movie-themed releases -- both timed to coincide with the pre-Halloween season -- are almost polar opposites. Opening last week to mostly negative reviews ""Hotel Transylvania"" is aimed squarely at the very youngest viewers with tired jokes about flatulence and an insipid lead performance by Adam Sandler as Count Dracula. ""Frankenweenie"" on the other hand arrives this weekend with a very different pedigree and a jolt of jangly energy. The story of a young science nerd who brings his dead dog back to life with a blast from a lightning bolt ""Frankenweenie"" is an expansive new adaptation by Tim Burton of his 1984 live-action short of the same name. Designed to appeal to both discriminating adults and older kids the gorgeous black-and-white stop-motion film is a fresh clever and affectionate love letter to classic horror movies. Warning It is decidedly not for little children. Like Burtons 1984 short which famously got the filmmaker fired from Disney for being too intense for tots ""Frankenweenie"" is a deliciously dark tale. At least one youngster could be heard loudly whimpering during a recent screening begging to be taken home. The grown-ups in the audience however seemed to love it. Transplanting Mary Shelleys 19th-century story to the 1950s ""Frankenweenie"" is the story of 10-year-old Victor Frankenstein (voice of Charlie Tahan) a bookish loner whose best friend is his dog Sparky. After Sparky is hit by a car a desperate distraught Victor applies some half-remembered lessons in electricity from his slightly unhinged science teacher (Martin Landau) and reanimates the pet pooch one dark and stormy night. All is well until some of Victors classmates get wind of the secret experiment and begin resurrecting all of their dearly departed pets too including a hamster and some Sea-Monkeys. (It helps if youre old enough to know what ""Sea-Monkeys"" -- a.k.a. brine shrimp -- even are. ""Just add water"" read the old ad which used to run in the back of comic books.) That they turn into something resembling the evil beasties from ""Gremlins"" is only one of several loving homages to the cinematic world of creature features. One Japanese-American kid Toshiaki (James Hiroyuki Liao) unleashes a Godzilla-like monster when his late pet turtle -- mischievously named Shelley -- turns into a giant rampaging reptile. Its great fun. So is the overall look of the film which portrays Victor and everyone else in it as pallid sunken-eyed (though lovable) ghouls. The boy who first discovers Victors secret is a hunchbacked kid named Edgar -- more familiarly known as ""E"" -- Gore (Atticus Shaffer). You have to say it out loud to get the pun. Screenwriter John August who worked with Burton on ""Dark Shadows"" and other films fills ""Frankenweenie"" with lots of equally wonderful if silly in-jokes. Catherine OHara and Martin Short vividly portray Victors parents along with a variety of other characters. And as Victors next-door neighbor Elsa Van Helsing Winona Ryder seems to be channeling her sardonic character from Burtons 1988 hit ""Beetlejuice."" Its a knowing nod to a great performance rather than a retread. The choice here is clear. Leave ""Hotel Transylvania"" and its soulless Saturday-morning computer animation to the wee ones. But for a touch of Saturday night sophistication you cant do better than ""Frankenweenie."" Contains some scary images and morbid thematic material.

Photo Do as theyre doing Watch ""Frankenweenie"" in glorious 3-D. Frankenweenie is Tim Burtons best film in years. With this expanded beautifully realized and highly entertaining animated version of his famous 1984 live-action short about a young loner and his resurrected dog Burton whose films have gotten progressively more overblown and overproduced goes back to ghoulish basics. Its an endearingly modest and affectionate tribute to the classic 1930s monsters and their influence on daydreaming kids like Burton who grew up in suburbia four decades later. The first black-and-white 3-D feature film since the 1950s ""Frankenweenie is a great retro experience enacted by exquisitely detailed miniature models in slightly jerky stop-motion animation -- a medium Burton previously employed to great effect for ""The Nightmare Before Christmas and ""Corpse Bride."" The excellent voice cast features many veterans of Burtons past films including Martin Short and Catherine OHara in several roles. But the filmmaker has wisely given a rest to his overworked muses Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Charlie Tahan voices young Victor Frankenstein whose only friend the family dog Sparky is run over by a car. Our bereft hero gets an idea when his science teacher (Martin Landau who won an Oscar for playing Bela Lugosi in Burtons ""Ed Wood and here channeling character actor J. Carrol Naish) demonstrates the effect of electrical current on a deceased frog. Borrowing his moms kitchen utensils some Christmas decorations and an assortment of umbrellas resourceful Victor turns his attic into a makeshift laboratory where he harnesses lightning. He manages to bring Sparkys stitched-together corpse back to life though he keeps having to sew the dogs tail back on. Victor is successful at least at first in hiding the re-animated pet from his parents (voiced by Short and OHara) who were concerned about his lack of interest in sports even before he took up his new hobby. The secret is shared with his Gothic young neighbor Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder) whose uncle is the pompous mayor of the town. All heck breaks loose though when a trio of Victors classmates learn about his experiments thanks to the snooping of a hunchbacked misfit named ""E Gore (who sounds just like Peter Lorre). Their own far more problematic experiments wreak havoc at local town New Hollands annual celebration of its heritage which includes a large windmill on a hill that figures prominently at the climax. There are significant overlaps in plot with this summers 3-D stop-motion animated ""ParaNorman -- both films also open with the heroes watching homemade 3-D movies -- which was originally going to be directed by Burtons ""Nightmare Before Christmas collaborator Henry Selick. But ""Frankenweenie is still the most Tim Burton-y of the directors films and not just because it contains a vast catalog of references to his own movies -- everything from ""Edward Scissorhands to the underrated 1989 ""Batman. The films creepy but basically sweet humor and its entire look is pure Burton -- including a cat named Mr. Whiskers who turns into a vampire and a poodle whos transformed by electricity into an iconic female horror character. Burton leaves no horror stone unturned from mummies to werewolves -- and he even throws in giant monsters from 50s Japanese movies for good measure. Even when he turns to spectacle Burton never lets ""Frankenweenie veer very far from the bond between Victor and his imperfectly resurrected pet. Thats what makes this one so special.

Photo Credit Disney Enterprises advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A budding young scientist jolts his dead dog back to life. BOTTOM LINE Quintessential Tim Burton mixing ghoulish humor and childlike whimsy. Landau as a crazed science teacher steals the show. CAST Voices of Charlie Tahan Winona Ryder Martin Landau LENGTH 127 Tim Burton continues his quest to mix the scary with the cutesy the horrifying with the heartwarming in ""Frankenweenie"" a stop-motion animated feature about a little boy who misses his dead dog so much that he jolts it back to life. Though shot in stark black and white like a classic Universal monster movie this is actually a Disney film which means theres plenty of fairy dust sprinkled around. ""Frankenweenie"" centers on Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan) an eccentric kid whose best friend is a bull terrier named Sparky. After Sparkys untimely end Victor gets a ghoulish idea that involves grave-digging a lightning storm and a Ben Franklinesque kite. The result Sparky is good as new save for the unsightly sewing job. Soon nearly every kid in the subdivision is off to the pet cemetery but subsequent experiments turn out a little differently.

Burton has been mining this dark-but-delightful vein for a long time now (""Frankenweenie"" began as a live-action short in 1984) which means this movie cant get by on novelty. The script by frequent Burton collaborator John August feels somewhat thin populated mostly by jokey homages like the mopey Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder) and a hunchback kid named Edward ""E"" Gore (Atticus Shaffer). The films most memorable character is Mr. Rzykruski an Eastern European science teacher given just the right touch of Cold War insanity by Martin Landau (""Ed Wood""); Sparky is also an endearing creation imbued with wiggly waggly dogginess by animation supervisor Trey Thomas and his team. For all its dark shadings though ""Frankenweenie"" is so softhearted that it passes up the chance to confront real issues of death mortality and grieving. Its a quintessential Burton film but also more Disney than a lot of Disney films. PLOT A budding young scientist jolts his dead dog back to life.

Landau as a crazed science teacher steals the show. Tim Burton a boy his dog and a movie Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff Tim Burtons ""Frankenweenie"" features plenty of homages to classic monster movies -- those produced by Universal in the 1930s atomic horror from the 50s; theres even a cameo from Christopher Lee as Dracula in one of Englands Hammer productions. But Burton made sure to note that the movie geek references were just window dressing for a very personal story about processing grief and coping with loss. (""Frankenweenie"" concerns Victor Frankenstein a young boy who borrows a page from Mary Shelleys famous mad scientist to resurrect his beloved bull terrier Sparky after hes hit by a car.) ""I was a boy once"" Burton 54 said. ""I had a dog. It was based on that first kind of pure relationship. It was quite unconditional your first love in a way. He also had this thing called distemper -- they said he wasnt going to live for very long and he ended up living quite a long time but there was always this specter hanging over. Youre a kid you dont really understand it but thats where the whole thing sort of stemmed from."" ""Frankenweenie"" was shot over 21 / 2 years inside a converted warehouse in East London. About 200 puppets -- including 16 Sparkys -- were manufactured for the production. -- Los Angeles Times Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 05 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 05 2012 305PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Tim Burton Written by John August Tim Burton Starring Charles Tahan Martin Short Catherine OHara Winona Ryder Classification PG Genre animation Year 2012 Country USA Language English You have to feel pleased just for the existence of a film like Tim Burtons Frankenweenie. A 3-D black-and-white stop-motion animated film its a one-man blow for cinematic biodiversity. Brought growling and twitching back to life after almost 30 years it was originally conceived as a half-hour short for Disney in 1984 to accompany screenings of Pinocchio . Disney failed to see what was family-friendly in this story of a weird boy and his dead dog and shelved the film instead. A scene from ""Frankenweenie"" CP Movies Video Burton pays tribute to horror films in Frankenweenie Director and producer Tim Burton poses with cast member Winona Ryder at the premiere of Frankenweenie at El Capitan theatre in Hollywood California September 24 2012. The movie opens in the U.S. on Oct. 5 2012 Mario Anzuoni video Video Frankenweenie introduces death loss to kids Screen grab from online trailer for ""Frankenweenie"" Movies Frankenweenie The official trailer After the subsequent successes of Burtons Pee-wees Big Adventure Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice Frankenweenie resurfaced as a home video and DVD extra but Burton always said he wanted to develop it as a feature film. Now its finally here and it all feels familiar - in a good way. The additional hour of running time doesnt add much to the story but it doesnt diminish Frankenweenies bizarre delights either.Born long before the 1990s animation revolution of Disney and Pixar Frankenweenie looks eye-poppingly fresh in its hand-crafted black-and-white design. It also feels soaked in the old Burton sensibility. After more than a decade of adapting other peoples work - from Sleepy Hollow to Dark Shadows - Burton is back on his own sweetly grotesque terrain and the movie has as many echoes of his own movies as it does of classic horror films.The suburban setting immediately evokes Edward Scissorhands and as in Scissorhands we meet another lost soul in that world of stifling conformity. Waifish 10-year-old Victor (voiced by Charles Tahan) lives in New Holland a place known for its soulless tract housing celebrations of all things Dutch and a disproportionate incidence of electrical storms.As in his previous animated films (The Nightmare Before Christmas Corpse Bride) Burtons characters resemble insects as much as humans with oversized eyeballs spidery limbs and often ball-like bodies. Victor whose surname is Frankenstein is a loner who makes home-made disaster movies in his private refuge in the attic all of them starring his irrepressible bull terrier Sparky. The closest person to a kindred spirit in town is his gloomy next-door neighbour Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder) the niece of the towns bullying mayor.Victors kindly parents (voiced by Catherine OHara and Martin Short) who dont want him to grow up ""you know weird"" urge him to do something normal like play baseball. But Victors foray into team sports leads to tragedy when Sparky chasing a ball across the street gets fatally struck by a car. Victor is devastated but during a lab demonstration by his eccentric science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (which seems to be pronounced ""Rice Krispy"") he finds a sign of hope. The teacher (voiced by Martin Landau reprising his Bela Lugosi accent from Burtons Ed Wood) makes a dead frog twitch when giving it a shock of electricity so Victor decides to re-animate Sparky for a science fair experiment. A journey to the pet cemetery is followed by a trip to Victors attic laboratory during a raging storm.Once the premise is established the script by Burtons frequent collaborator John August (Corpse Bride Big Fish) loses some momentum. Victor keeps hiding the animated and stitched-together Sparky and Sparky keeps doing things to draw attention to himself. Eventually the threatening neighbourhood children discover Victors secret and decide to go into the reanimation business themselves reawakening cats turtles and sea monkeys. Soon the town is engulfed in a messy invasion reminiscent of Mars Attacks.In its meticulous visual design mordant humour and happenstance plotting Frankenweenie was the original template and its now a kind of summing up of almost every good Tim Burton movie The misfit hero the special hiding place where he creates and the alarming world outside where chaos can so easily be triggered.

(AP Photo/Disney) Photo Disney Associated Press Frankenweenie movie review 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Frankenweenie Animation. Directed by Tim Burton. Featuring the voices of Charlie Tahan and Atticus Shaffer. (PG. 87 minutes.) Tim Burton once again realizes his ghoulishly beautiful worldview in ""Frankenweenie"" a 3-D mash note to fright-film nostalgia. It is pure retro-cinematic joy in its glorious monochrome; in its tips of the hat to classic villains from Frankenstein and Dracula to the Burgermeister Meisterburger of ""Santa Claus Is Comin to Town""; and in its gloom-and-doomy gothic art design and stop-motion puppetry which return us to the spindle-legged animated Burton-verse of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Corpse Bride."" The overall effect is great cinema good fun a visual feast for pie-eyed Burton fans - and a terrifically warped reminder of just how freaky a PG film can be. Any child whos easily spooked at the movies should stay wide of this one as it ventures into some pretty dark territory pretty darned quickly. As someone observes near the climax ""Reanimating a corpse Its very ... upsetting"" The corpse being reanimated is a dog - a cute little feller named Sparky who gets smushed by a car then put to rest then exhumed then patched up and strapped to a table by his grieving owner. Thats Victor (voiced by Charlie Tahan) a strange pale boy whose strangeness and paleness resemble blushing normalcy next to all the other anemic weirdos at New Holland Elementary School. There a brilliant science teacher with a Slavic accent (Martin Landau) delivers the most illuminating disquisition on electrical storms Ive ever witnessed. From this lecture Victor gleans the raw facts necessary to bring back Sparky. And back he comes though he draws flies loses body parts and leaks on occasion. Where the plot goes from there is easy enough to guess if youve read Mary Shelley watched any Universal horror classics or seen any of the movies many other referents. So you wont be surprised when a hunchbacked boy gets into mischief with a kid who looks and lisps like Boris Karloff (Martin Short). Some of the madness is all Burtons ""Frankenweenie"" is in fact a remake and expansion of his own live-action black-and-white 1984 short which featured essentially the same plot - and unquestionably the same Burtonesque knack for mashing the morbid with the sweet.

Disney photo Disney Edgar ""E"" Gore voiced by Atticus Shaffer in ""Frankenweenie."" Disney photo Disney Victor Frankenstein voiced by Charlie Tahan with Sparky in ""Frankenweenie."" Disney Once upon a time there was a boy who loved his pet. When it was killed by a cruel and indifferent world the boy grieved -- until technology allowed him to reanimate the pet which grew bigger than ever.That boy was Tim Burton whose pet was a half-hour horror spoof called ""Frankenweenie"" which he made for Disney in 1984. The studio hated it and fired the apprentice director who then built a lucrative career elsewhere. Now Disney has bankrolled a full-length animated version of ""Frankenweenie."" Its an infectious labor of love crystallizing the theme of creative rebirth and the look of yesteryear schlock that elevated Burtons live-action ""Ed Wood"" and his animated ""Corpse Bride.""Like the recent and similarly targeted toon ""Paranorman"" ""Frankenweenie"" begins with a boy protagonist watching a B-movie with his family. He is Victor Frankenstein (voice of Charlie Tahan) a student in a town called New Holland that seems embalmed in the era of black-and-white TV. Victor has made a monster movie starring his canine best friend a bull terrier named Sparky. Victor inspired by a wild-eyed teacher with a Bela Lugosi accent (Martin Landau) is excited about the upcoming science fair. But his parents (Martin Short and Catherine OHara) want him to play sports and make friends. When Victor takes a swing at baseball it causes a fatal accident for Sparky and the boy is devastated.But then lightning strikes -- literally -- and Victor is able to raise his dog from the dead. He tries to keep the secret locked in his attic but some science-fair competitors and an Igor-like neighbor sniff it out and by the time of the citys annual carnival freakish beasts arise from the pet cemetery. While the big-headed spindly puppets dont evoke enough emotion to make the movie a must-see Burtons 3-D design team pours its heart into the monochrome surroundings from the suburban decor to Victors laboratory to the carnival midway. And although the movie deals with death the macabre elements are sugar-coated enough for kids while the stop-motion peril is paced like a 50s creepshow rather than a millennial shocker. Some audiences might feel that ""Frankenweenie"" is creaky but those on the same wavelength as Burton will gratefully declare its alive.FRANKENWEENIEThree stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 127  Content Mild peril and mature themes Find theaters and showtimes for Frankenweenie Oct 4 2012 (...)

"Frankenweenie a Tim Burton homage to horror classics movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Frankenweenie a Tim Burton homage to horror classicsThe animated film fleshed out from his 1984 short is a technical triumph with warmly memorable characters but the story has its weak points.October 04 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Victor and his dog sparky in Tim Burtons stop-action animated film... (Disney Enterprises )Tim Burton cinematic champion of weirdos outsiders and overlooked geniuses has long been stitching together broken psyches. Over the years hes taken detours for big-budget reprises such as ""Alice in Wonderland"" ""Sweeney Todd"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" some a better fit than others. In contrast ""Frankenweenie"" his new animated riff on horror classics about a boy with a scientific bent resurrecting his pet dog feels very much a return to form.Actually its more like the filmmaker has come home kicked up his feet and done exactly as he wants in this love letter to the original ""Frankenstein"" a cue thunder and lightning. Indeed an unabashed affection for the entire genre electrifies every labor-intensive stop-motion move that young Victor (Charlie Tahan) his hopelessly devoted bull terrier Sparky and the rest of this eccentric collection of characters make.The artistry reaches absolute perfection. ""Frankenweenies"" characters are a true reflection of the darkly ironic mind of the director and the film overall is a paean to the meticulous craft of stop-motion a process so difficult and demanding you must love it to do it and Burton has never done it better. Even his decision to go decisively black-and-white is made intriguingly vibrant with the addition of 3-D. Its the story that poses some problems.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of FrankenweenieThere are so many horror auteurs Burton wants to thank that the film is absolutely bursting at the seams with knowing nods.Victors parents are the Frankensteins (Catherine OHara and Martin Short doing multiple voices). There is an inspiring science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau) who looks and sounds suspiciously like Vincent Price. Among Victors few friends is Edgar ""E"" Gore (Atticus Shaffer) who has a hunch on his back and the cloying way of Bela Lugosi in ""Dracula"" circa 1931. Mayor Burgemeister ahem lives next door with his niece Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder) whose poodle Persephone has a Madeline Kahn in ""Young Frankenstein""-styled pouf. I wont go on but the director does making it far too easy to get lost in the allusions.A school science fair and an unfortunate accident that involves Sparky a ball and a car are what ignite the reanimation idea in the first place. Victor cant imagine life without his best friend so whats a boy to do?VIDEO Martin Landau talks FrankenweenieA midnight trip to retrieve Sparky from the pet cemetery a massive thunderstorm an elaborate generating system constructed from Moms kitchen appliances a few bolts of lightning and bang Sparky is back in barking business.When Victors nerd competitors at school get a whiff of what hes done suddenly every 10-year-old in town wants to get into the reanimating game. All manner of monsters are born all sorts of pets are supercharged and supersized. And like a scene out of ""Godzilla"" someone has to save the day. Nearly every beat has been dug up from horror films past.Burton is credited with the idea which he first sketched out years ago for a 1984 short that also carried the ""Frankenweenie"" name. Frequent Burton collaborator John August gets credit for the screenplay which was based on a screenplay by Lenny Ripps who co-wrote the 84 short with the filmmaker. Augusts collaboration on the lively and lovely ""Corpse Bride"" and his adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic for ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" were more satisfying.Now to the genuinely genius side of the film. Burtons go-to guy for music the marvelous Danny Elfman has certainly done his part with a devilishly fun score. But its the characters who are so winsome and so winning. They have that signature Burton style a stick-thin limbs that give an elegance to the smallest gestures topped by heads that have the look of an elongated egg. The faces are dominated by golf-ball-sized eyes a mere pinch of a nose and mouths that are so individualized and personality-infused that they become their own graphic talking point.Though Burton has said he chose to go black-and-white as part of the homage to those earlier films in truth the filmmaker tends to favor muted shades of gray. That slightly somber palette colors everything he does whether hes working in live action like his iconic ""Edward Scissorhands"" or in animation; his Oscar-nominated ""Corpse Bride"" had the barest hints of color. Even the rainbow of ""Alice in Wonderland"" had a softness to it.The mutedness serves the moodiness you find in the stories he tells. What is masterful about all the shading and shadows is that it also becomes a way to lighten things up at precisely the right moment and often enchantingly a the final scene in ""Corpse Bride"" with its cloud of butterflies nearly every scene in ""Alice in Wonderland."" He has used that tonality deftly here it keeps ""Frankenweenie"" visually stunning and the sensibility light. Its too bad the tale like Sparkys wagging appendage keeps falling off.---FrankenweenieMPAA rating PG for thematic elements scary images and actionRunning time 1 hour 27 minutesPlaying In general releasebetsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Hollywood back lot moments Latest movie reviews PHOTOS NC-17 movies Why they got the rating MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTim Burton replays his past for FrankenweenieDecember 6 2012Hotel Transylvania Frankenweenie have monster animationAugust 31 2012Frankenweenie is an ode to monster moviesJanuary 15 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowTim BurtonNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-frankenweenie-review-20121005,0,298743.story",200,frankenweenie13,frankenweenie,latimes

And what filmmaker wouldnt relish the chance to redo something he felt he didnt get quite right the first time around either for lack of funds or for lack of support from a studio? Tim Burton probably had every reason to want to refashion his 1984 live-action short Frankenweenie -- about a boy who resuscitates his recently deceased dog using methods straight out of James Whales Frankenstein -- into an extravagant full-length stop-motion feature. Hed made the original Frankenweenie a compact funny and deeply touching bit of filmmaking when he was a young animator at Disney. But because audiences responded to it negatively at early screenings -- some parents deemed it too dark for the kiddies -- the picture was shelved and Burton and Disney parted ways. Now Burton is back with a bigger but not necessarily better Frankenweenie -- again made for Disney -- and the picture is frustrating not because its bad but because of how almost-good it is. The movies first half in particular is surprisingly effective and affecting and for the most part it preserves the joyful-melancholy spirit of the earlier film. That picture rendered suburbia in beautiful radioactively glowing black and white as a place where anything could happen a place where fair-minded authority figures like Daniel Stern and Shelley Duvall might be your parents a place where love -- plus electricity -- is so strong it can even supersede death. But the second half of the new Frankenweenie floats out of Burtons control; its noisy and boisterous and well big -- an overgrown parade balloon and an affront to the gentle intimacy of Burtons original idea. Young Victor Frankenstein (voiced here by Charlie Tahan) is a skinny suburban loner who enjoys tinkering with scientific equipment and playing with his dog Sparky whos also his only friend. Victors parents (Catherine OHara and Martin Short) worry about him Mr. Frankenstein in particular wishes that hed do more normal kid stuff like play sports. i Edgar (Atticus Shaffer) the films Igor character accidentally causes problems for Victor and his pooch. Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Walt Disney Pictures Edgar (Atticus Shaffer) the films Igor character accidentally causes problems for Victor and his pooch. Walt Disney Pictures Victor makes a halfhearted attempt at baseball which leads to the accidental demise of Sparky. (The moment is handled discreetly off-camera though it has the proper amount of emotional weight.) The already-haggard lad becomes despondent until hes inspired by the new science teacher at his school -- a beanpole Vincent Price lookalike with the delightfully unpronounceable name Mr. Rzykruski voiced by Martin Landau -- to raise Sparky from the dead via the wonders of electricity. Victor sets up an elaborate laboratory in his attic and with the help of a lightning storm and a few ordinary household objects (including a toaster and light-up Christmas reindeer) jolts new life into Sparky. Although the Sparky from the original Frankenweenie a bull terrier with two Karloffian bolts sticking out of his neck still wins the top prize for ugly-cuteness this stop-motion Sparky with his expressive eyes and snuffly nose is plenty adorable. But Burton doesnt give us enough of him. He drops out of sight for long stretches and when hes absent the plot gets excessively complicated and includes too many unappealing or uninteresting characters including a grouchy megalomaniacal neighbor Mr. Burgemeister (also voiced by Short) and his wan Goth niece (Winona Ryder). Thats not to say the second half of Frankenweenie doesnt boast touches of great cleverness among them a throng of maniacal overgrown Sea-Monkeys who look all too much like the ones pictured in the back of the comic books -- which is to say they look nothing like real-life Sea-Monkeys those disappointing little curlicues drifting dispiritingly in a glass of water. And Burton shows a great deal of integrity by making the new Frankenweenie black and white as the original was. That will surely be a novelty to plenty of kids but it also gives the picture a classical elegant look. Still integrity can take you only so far. And in terms of its design Frankenweenie stumbles in a few crucial ways notably in the character design of young Victor He looks too much like a post-plastic-surgery Michael Jackson -- his nose has been snipped away to a tiny unappealing nub. That makes him a little hard to look at and even harder to care about. Burton half succeeds in making this revamped Frankenweenie its own distinctive creature pieced together from the essential bits of the 29-minute original. But he just doesnt know when to stop and his overgrown creation gets the better of him. Sometimes small really is beautiful.

Video Trailer Frankenweenie More about Frankenweenie >> Its a far more elaborate animated remake of the live-action short that first gained Burton attention back in 1984. An isolated adolescent named Victor Frankenstein living in the wasteland of suburbia builds a makeshift lab in the attic of his parents house to shock back to life his beloved pet Sparky. The bolt-necked dog its skin stitched together like a crooked quilt creates havoc in the neighborhood. And when Victors spooky classmates duplicate his experiment with other animal cadavers dug up at the pet cemetery the town is overrun. There was a sweetness to the original in which Victor was played by adorable child star Barret Oliver (The NeverEnding Story). In Burtons fully mature vision the boy (voiced by Charlie St. Clouds Charlie Tahan) is a freakishly attenuated figure with giant ghoulish eyes rimmed with black. The closest thing to a heroic character in Frankenweenie is Mr. Rzykruski a substitute science teacher who looks like Vincent Price with three times too many teeth and who sounds like a Hungarian count. (Hes voiced by Martin Landau. Others in the cast include Martin Short Catherine OHara and Winona Ryder.) There are two remarkable aspects to this feature. Its 3-D effects are almost excessively realistic. When Victor starts shoveling in the graveyard you can practically feel the dirt caking to your shoes. Above all else Frankenweenie is a devoted homage to old black-and-white horror films particularly and most pointedly to James Whales 1931 classic Frankenstein with Boris Karloff as the monster. You can see why such a scrupulous tribute would have impressed the veteran filmmakers at the Disney Studio nearly 30 years ago. But who did Burton have in mind - besides himself - when he fashioned this exhaustive animated remake? Kids wont get the references and they wont get the jokes. Adults other than film geeks wont have the patience. Its not so much a miscalculation of his audience by Burton as it is a disregard. What lingers after Frankenweenie far more than its stunning technique is a sad suggestion of solipsism. Frankenweenie  (out of four stars) Directed by Tim Burton. Voices by Charlie Tahan Catherine OHara Martin Short Winona Ryder and Martin Landau. Distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. Running time 1 hour 27 mins.

Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint COLIN COVERT colincovert In the same spurting vein as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""The Corpse Bride"" Tim Burtons delightful ""Frankenweenie"" stitches together macabre comedy and ticklish horror. With stop-motion 3-D animation that feels both handcrafted and elegant it tells the tale of Victor (voiced by Charlie Tahan) one of Burtons patented lonely-boy heroes. The lads introversion and science geekery mark him as an oddball in his sunny conformist suburb of New Holland. His dad (Martin Short) is proud but perturbed by Victors zeal for directing back-yard creature features. ""I dont want him to turn out you know weird"" he frets though that horse has clearly escaped the barn. The mass-produced uniformity of the housing development radiates bright bland despair. While his Goth neighbor Elsa (Winona Ryder) likes him Victors only pal is his mutt Sparky a rat-shaped creature with a jelly bean nose and huge goggle eyes. When Sparky runs afoul of a moving car Victor builds an attic laboratory to reanimate him. The work space is a clever homage to ""Frankensteins"" spectacularly elaborate art deco lab complete with a platform that lifts Sparky skyward to be zapped by lightning bolts. Sparky returns stitched together but frisky as ever his tail still wagging after it falls off. Envious classmate Edgar (Atticus Shaffer) with the posture of a comma and the nasal diction of a junior Peter Lorre discovers that Victor has tampered with natural law and will therefore win the school science competition. He blackmails Victor spreading the secret among his pals who create monstrosities that recall the invisible man malicious gremlins and Japans towering turtle Gamera. Fans of old horror films and Burtons work will find visual quotations in every fastidiously designed frame. The towns portly mayor could have played the burgomaster in a 1930s Universal horror film and Victors immigrant science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau) is a ringer for Vincent Price. Thanks to a clever script by Burtons longtime collaborator John August ""Frankenweenie"" does more than turn the horror classic on its squared-off head. It digs deep into the themes that made James Whales 1931 masterpiece such an indelible experience. Most horror-movie villains simply frighten the audience. Frankensteins monster was misunderstood childish sympathetic an involuntary outcast who simply wanted to be loved. So is Sparky his spindly master Victor and possibly Burton himself who calls making movies ""an expensive form of therapy for me."" Burton keeps telling variations of this story over and over again. In ""Edward Scissorhands"" ""Ed Wood"" and this one he nails it. Disney Disney ""Frankenweenie"" The story brims with self-parody social satire horror nostalgia wit and emotional insight with Burton keeping all the plates spinning. Landau invests surprising subtleties of emotion in his Transylvanian-sounding science teacher firing subversive zingers at thickwits who welcome the comforts that science provides ""but not the questions it asks."" Shaffers wheezy whiny vocal performance is so delirious I beamed every time his character appeared. ""Frankenweenie"" is a welcome rebound for Burton after the poorly paced excesses of ""Dark Shadows."" Hes got his spark back.

There may be second acts in American lives but they hardly ever get to do the same act. And do-overs as gracefully executed as Tim Burtons ""Frankenweenie"" are almost unheard of. The movie a simple yet immensely pleasurable tale of a little boy and his undead dog is good enough on its own. If you know the back story its even better. In 1984 when he was an eccentric young animator working for Disney the young Burton made a 30-minute live-action short called ""Frankenweenie"" about a boy named Victor and the scrappy pet he brings back to life after its hit by a car. The movie was weird it was inventive and it spooked the bejesus out of Disney executives who refused to release it and fired Burton. After the director became famous in the wake of ""Edward Scissorhands"" the company put it out on VHS; it now can be found as an extra on the ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" DVD. The current entertainment landscape has been effectively Burton-ized; this season alone there are two pallid family-film imitations ""ParaNorman"" and ""Hotel Transylvania"" that arguably wouldnt exist had the director not made the world safe for light pop-goth gloom. The new improved ""Frankenweenie"" is thus not only revenge served sweetly -- its being released by Disney tail between its legs -- but a reminder that at his best Burton belongs in the same bleakly charming league as Charles Addams and Edward Gorey. No live actors were harmed in its making; as with ""Nightmare"" and Burtons ""The Corpse Bride"" ""Frankenweenie"" is stop-motion animation. Like the classic horror movies to which it owes its genetic makeup (more on that later) its in black and white; unlike them its in 3-D. Yet the film easily straddles new and old. The puppetry has a handmade careworn quality -- you can see the marks where the artisans have worked the characters over. The 3-D doesnt boink you in the face but instead seduces a viewer into a sparse yet fully realized alternate world. Were in a familiar surreal suburbia perhaps just down the block from ""Edward Scissorhands."" Young Victor Frankenstein (the voice of Charlie Tahan) is a gentle misfit who quite prefers being alone with his inventions and his spheroid little mutt Sparky. The movie doesnt set us up for an anti-bullying things-get-better message as ""ParaNorman"" does; if anything everyones a little monstrous here. Victors schoolmates include a sniveling henchman (Atticus Shaffer) named Edgar Gore -- E. Gore get it? -- who talks like Peter Lorre a towering Boris Karloff look-alike (Martin Short) the slightly depressive Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder) and Weird Girl (Catherine OHara) whose eyes take up most of her cranium and who carries a moth-eaten cat named Mr. Whiskers everywhere she goes. If Edgar Allan Poe ran a day-care center itd look like this. Early on Sparky meets his maker chasing a ball across the street; its not graphic but it sure seems final and the very young and very tender will have a brief rough time of it. Taking inspiration from his sepulchral science teacher (Martin Landau) -- the characters a ringer for Burtons onetime father-figure Vincent Price -- Victor hightails it to his attic fires up the Tesla coils and reanimates Sparky as a frisky affectionate patchwork pet. Mans best fiend. So far ""Frankenweenie"" has followed in the tracks of the 1984 original to the point of similar camera shots. Once Sparky returns it takes off in beguiling new directions. Theres a science fair coming up and all the kids want in on Victors breakthrough; the local pet cemetery is quickly looted battery cables pilfered makeshift operating theaters set up. The results are not as expected. ""Frankenweenie"" is a mere 87 minutes long which turns out to be just the right length; theres not enough time for Burton to go off the rails as he does in so many of his films. Along with ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Ed Wood"" its his most sustained consistent work and it builds naturally to a climax at the local town fair that is a thing of eldritch farce. I wont spoil the fun other than to say that all the nods to horror-movie history that have peppered the movie up to now come to a delirious head. ""Frankenweenie"" doesnt throw these at us with overbearing winkery but rather folds them in like extras in a souffle. Old and new everythings here the phone booth from ""The Birds"" the porta-potty from ""Jurassic Park"" a jigger of ""Gremlins"" a dash of ""Godzilla."" Burton isnt doing this for hipster points but out of love. These movies hes saying are what made him the mad scientist he is today. Is it really for kids? Oh my yes -- kids 8 and up or so and their parents and grandparents and cousins. ""Frankenweenie"" is scary but then its funny and finally its moving both in its foolproof boy-meets-dog sentimentality and in the ease with which Burton connects the dots of his own history and that of the movies he cherishes. The most critical forebear obviously -- Burtons beloved ur-text -- is ""Frankenstein"" the 1931 cinematic classic that loosed Karloff and the iconic figure of the Frankenstein monster upon the world. From the bolts on Sparkys neck to the clanking chains that lift the operating table to the lightning above from the mob to the windmill ""Frankenweenie"" resuscitates director James Whales baroque vision and makes it resonate for a new generation. If your children groove on this film by all that is unholy sit them down with the original and watch their eyes go bigger than Weird Girls as they do the pop-culture math. Burton has created a literal ""Young Frankenstein"" and . . . its alive. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Area theaters. Cinematically speaking this may be the best scary season kids have had in recent memory. ""ParaNorman"" ""Hotel Transylvania"" and now Tim Burtons 3-D charmer ""Frankenweenie"" are paving the perfect path toward Halloween. Packed with visual delights for all ages this black-and-white animated adventure is actually an extension of Burtons 1984 short of the same name. As before he uses a relatively simple plot to pay extensive homage to the classic horror films that have inspired him. Middle-schooler Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan) lives with his parents (Catherine OHara Martin Short) in New Holland a 1950s suburban town thats been run through the Burton mill. The science teacher for example looks like a cross between Vincent Price and Martin Landau (who provides the voice). Victors classmates have names like E Gore (Atticus Shaffer) Weird Girl (OHara) and Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder). Victors best friend however is his dog Sparky. When the poor animal is hit by a car a desperate Victor tries to bring Sparky back to life. The experiment works but not without some pretty severe consequences. Burtons extraordinary powers of imagination are in dazzling bloom from the gorgeous stop-motion animation to the goofy homemade horror movies the children direct. Victor and Sparky in Time Burtons Frankenweenie Burtons previous collaborator John August (""Big Fish"" ""Corpse Bride"") wrote the clever screenplay. Despite the gently macabre tone there are no gratuitous scares or elbow-nudging ironies. Just a witty warm appreciation of cinema science and the creativity of childhood.

Comments click to enlarge Frankenweenie Rated PG  87 minutes  2012 With his early live-action short Frankenweenie (1984) Tim Burton paid loving tribute to the classic Universal monster movies and to amateur filmmaking; with this slick feature-length animation he seems to be paying loving tribute to himself. Essentially a greatest hits exercise it has animated characters resembling those from The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride a squeaky suburban setting that recalls Edward Scissorhands and father-son schmaltz straight out of Big Fish. (Martin Landau giving voice to one of the characters even affects a Hungarian accent as he did in Ed Wood.) Missing however are the authentic feelings of morbidity and alienation that once made Burton an interesting filmmaker. With the voices of Martin Short Catherine OHara and Winona Ryder.

"Frankenweenie | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; frankenweenie ) Frankenweenie (United States 2012) October 04 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Frankenweenie is Tim Burtons animated remake of his live-action 1984 short of the same name. With its unabashed affection for classic monster movies and nods to Universal horror staples Frankenweenie is almost certain to be beloved by fans of the genre. Its mainstream commercial potential is uncertain. Burtons fascination with the macabre is in evidence here - some of the creations in this stop-motion nightmare may frighten young children. And Frankenweenie is in black-and-white - a somewhat gutsy decision on the part of Burton and Disney and one of the rare recent times when style has not taken a back seat to potential box office gain. At its heart Frankenweenie tells two love stories - that of a boy and his dog and that of a man and the movies he cherished as a child. Like Hugo and Super 8 Frankenweenie exists in part as an homage. This is a more personal movie for Burton than one might initially suspect. The very fact that he elected to re-tell this story after 28 years is an indication of how much it means to him. And I wouldnt be surprised to learn that as a kid he had a dog named Sparky. Even as the narrative becomes progressively more ghoulish and a Godzilla wannabe shows up Frankenweenie never loses its heart. The boy Victor Frankenstein (voice of Charlie Tahan) would appear to be a Tim Burton stand-in. He certainly bears more than a passing resemblance to a young version of the filmmaker. Victor has only one true friend his dog Sparky and when Sparky is killed chasing a ball across a street Victor is inconsolable. All is not lost however. Victors school science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau) preaches about the power of lightning and electricity. So Victor digs up Sparky patches him together and constructs a rig that will channel the power of a thunderstorm into the inanimate body. Soon after although a little worse for the wear Sparky is running jumping and playing. As Victors success becomes known schoolmates try the same thing with their extinct pets (rodents sea monkeys a turtle) but the results are not as benign. The 1984 version of Frankenweenie was a pretty straightforward re-imagining of Frankenstein. To beef the material up to three times the original length a variety of elements were added resulting in an oddly paced extended middle section. I enjoyed the sequence with the Godzilla knock-off stomping around town but wondered what this was doing in a version of Frankenstein. Burton hasnt employed so many references to old films since Ed Wood. Theres a nod to Elsa Lanchesters wild hairdo from The Bride of Frankenstein. The girl next door is named Elsa Van Helsing (her voice is supplied by Winona Ryder). Christopher Lees vocals have a cameo (playing Dracula). A dead pet is called ""Shelly"" (as in ""Mary Shelly""). Theres a hunchback named E Gore. And so on... If one was to compile a comprehensive list of every nod to an earlier production it would be longer than this review. Frankenweenie is a creation of stop-motion animation and represents Burtons first venture outside live action in seven years. Burton loves animation because of its ability to empower imagination. Its no coincidence that the best films he had produced in the last decade are this one and 2005s Corpse Bride. The animation is remarkably clean for stop-motion; there are only a few instances when there are minor hitches or stutters in a characters movement. The 3-D falls into the ""unnecessary but not damaging"" category. Since its in black-and-white there are no worries about muted muddy colors. (I believe this is the first bamp;w movie to be subjected to this iteration of 3-D.) Frankenweenie may confound children expecting something bright light and colorful. It is none of those three. The emotional content and visual style will have their greatest impact on sophisticated kids and older viewers. A lot of what Frankenweenie offers will be lost on those who havent seen the Universal horror canon or havent read Shellys novel. Even a familiarity with the directors oeuvre will add to the viewers ability to appreciate what Burton is attempting here. In keeping with a desire to make Frankenweenie low-key Burton avoids Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter instead employing the vocal talents of Charlie Tahan former collaborators Martin Short Winona Ryder and Catherine OHara. In general Im not the biggest fan of remakes but this is one instance in which the result justifies the effort. The 1984 short is entertaining but its transformation from live action to animation and the addition of extra material makes it a more rewarding experience both emotionally and stylistically. In terms of content its appropriate for most children but this is one instance when adults are likely to derive more pleasure than their offspring. Its not often that can be said about an animated endeavor.

"Frankenweenie review Its alive | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFrankenweenie review Its aliveFrankenweenie about a boy who brings his dead dog back to life is Tim Burtons third stop-motion animated movie with nods to classic horror movies from the past.Victor and undead dog sparky in the mostly winsome Frankenweenie.  (Disney)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Oct. 4 2012Frankenweenie(out of 4)Starring the voices of Charlie Tahan Martin Landau Winona Ryder Catherine OHara and Martin Short. Directed by Tim Burton. 90 minutes. Opens Oct. 5 at major theatres. PGTim Burtons comic monster movie mash-up Frankenweenie tosses black-and-white bouquets at the golden age of Hollywood horror.And it shows revenge is a dish best served in 3D with this entertaining stop-motion animated feature reborn from the live-action short that got him fired from studio Disney in 1984.Article Continued BelowBack when Burton made his Frankenweenie short starring Shelley Duvall and Daniel Stern he didnt get much studio love. Your stuff is too dark the brass at the mouse house pronounced. So Burton packed his pencils and went elsewhere to make the likes of Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands along with animated offerings including the Oscar-nominated Corpse Bride. Boo to you too Disney.Burton and Disney made up long ago with The Nightmare Before Christmas and now we have the reanimation (in both senses) of the once-dead Frankenweenie the story of a likeable grade school science nerd named Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan) who figures out an electrifying way to bring his beloved and recently dead pooch Sparky back to life.Its the third stop-motion animation from the filmmakers fertile mind and like Burtons original Frankenweenie embraces an earlier black-and-white time with dramatic shadows and camera angles. Its pretty much a shot-for-shot recreation of the 1984 short expanded with a story by frequent Burton collaborator John August.Burton returns to his favoured setting of suburban Weirdsville U.S.A. (here called New Holland) where the oddball residents treat bizarre behaviour as normal. Check out Victors classmates Edgar E. Gore (E. Gore get it?) Boris Karloff ringer Nassor (voiced by Martin Short) and the aptly named Weird Girl (Catherine OHara) a pale perpetually staring miss who sees prophesies in her devoted cat companions litter box leavings.Victors doting parents (Short and OHara) wish he was as good at making friends as he is at science. Perhaps morose next-door neighbour Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder) could fit the bill. But shes too busy avoiding her blowhard uncle the towns bombastic mayor (Short again).You can easily lose yourself in a game of Name That Classic as the story unfolds with nods to everything from Frankenstein to Gremlins The Fly and Godzillas nemesis Gamera with some Sea Monkeys thrown in. High-concept and stylish Frankenweenie is a playlist of films and characters from Burtons movie-loving childhood. Theres a Valentine to his hero Vincent Prince with creepy teacher Mr. Rzykruski (voiced by Martin Landau). As much a parody as genre love-in the laughs come frequently. Parents shouldnt worry too much about how kids will react to the scene where Sparky meets car and heads to the big fire hydrant in the sky. Victors grief and Sparkys loss are handled with tact and care for young feelings. Its the scary scenes at the climax including a shrieking horror hybrid bat-cat that will likely cause knocking knees.Victors work on the patch job required to get Sparky ready for the ultimate science experiment creates a lovable hound who can still turn the head of the poufy poodle next door the perpetually nervous Persephone.Sparky isnt the only thing stitched together from spare parts. The story gets its extra layers from a long list of movie sources to set the action during the run-up to the school science fair where Victors rivals led by boy genius Toshiaki are inspired to try to replicate the experiment when they find out Sparky is back among the living.Theyre unsure how Victor did it but figure it has something to do with Sparkys recently acquired neck bolts and New Hollands propensity for lightning strikes. Maybe that rickety old mill on the hill has something to do with the lavish lightning one kid observes which is sure to set Frankenstein fans to grinning.The story occasionally lumbers along stiff-legged like Mary Shelleys monster and the sly winks to other films are sometimes a tad too twee but Burton has earned the right to make a personal film. Frankenweenie has his signature on every frame.After all who can blame Burton for clasping his hands and crying ""Its alive"" to see his beloved 1984 creature rise from the cinematic grave?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Frankenweenie Review Its alive Or is it? - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Tim Burtons Frankenweenie Its alive Or is it?  1/2 Frankenweenie Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Before things took off with ""Pee-wees Big Adventure"" and ""Beetlejuice"" Tim Burton made a live-action black-and-white film in 1984 called ""Frankenweenie."" You can find it on YouTube. Its really good.Just about everything we now know as Burtonesque -- passionate devotion to 30s 40s 50s and 60s Hollywood English and Japanese horror; the ""Leave it to Beaver""-but-sinister vision of American domestic life; the black humor always in the corner of the societal outcast and the idiosyncratic artist -- was there from the beginning. Burton took the Frankenstein myth and redid it with a dog. Young Victor Frankenstein and his beloved bull terrier Sparky who stars in Victors homemade monster movies conduct a fantastic science experiment after Sparkys demise (this happens early) involving the re-animation of dead tissue. It works. So did the film.The new expanded but not improved ""Frankenweenie"" arrives in theaters this week again directed by Burton from a script by Burtons frequent screenwriter John August. This time ""Frankenweenie"" is an animated stop-motion 3-D affair though still in black and white. Stretching the story for an additional hour Burton unleashes a gaggle of cutely vicious monsters for a protracted climax including a Gamera-type giant turtle and nasty little flying cats with fangs and wings. In the vein of ""Mars Attacks"" (not one of my favorite Burtons) ""Frankenweenie"" has a somewhat jaded and uneasy air which seems an odd thing to say about a movie that does at heart believe in its boy/dog love story. But there it is.You name it youve seen it in earlier Burton films. The images of manicured slightly antiseptic suburbia? Straight out of ""Edward Scissorhands."" The ""sad underslept"" faces of the characters (my sons phrase) are very much in line with the sallow lineup of ""Corpse Bride."" The growling authority figure Mayor Burgemeister comes right out of ""Nightmare Before Christmas.""The key archetypes in ""Frankenweenie"" adhere closely to the best-known of the classic Frankenstein films James Whales 1931 original and the 1935 ""Bride of Frankenstein."" Victors Igor-like sidekick and the Vincent Price-inspired science teacher (here voiced by Martin Landau so sweet as Bela Lugosi in Burtons ""Ed Wood"") set the tone for playfully macabre scares and mildly amusing riffs. But the balance has been tipped toward horror this time too far for my taste. The monster-movie component of ""Frankenweenie"" stomps all over the appeal of the original 30-minute version. The pathos seems misjudged and a little ruthless; without the proper mixture of chills and whimsy poor Sparkys fate(s) come close to ""Vertigo"" territory which is ambitiously morbid territory indeed. And not quite right for ""Frankenweenie.""I like what actor Charlie Tahan does with Victors hesitant guarded voice and he blends in well with Burton regulars Catherine OHara (Mrs. Frankenstein and two other roles) and Winona Ryder (the timorous outcast-next-door). Martin Short relatively restrained handles three parts with aplomb. The entire project is carefully wrought in visual terms and more than a little familiar. Sometimes even a well-applied pair of jumper cables cant do the trick. mjphillipstribune.comFrankenweenie -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG (for thematic elements scary images and action)Running time 127Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Animation (Movie Genre) Frankenweenie (movie) Entertainment Movies Frankenstein (movie 1931) Igor (movie) Ed Wood (movie) 10 movies to see this fall Five movies to see at Chicago International Film Festival Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising71deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1002-frankenweenie-20121004,0,2191458.column",200,frankenweenie24,frankenweenie,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Strip all the loving references to classic horror movies out of Tim Burtons stop-motion feature Frankenweenie and there wouldnt be much left to it--possibly not much more than the 30-minute live-action short that was the storys first incarnation back in 1984. The references extend from the 1931 Boris Karloff version of Frankenstein to 1965s Gamera to Burtons past work and they invade every aspect of the film the black-and-white color palette character designs scenes shot setups gags dialogue casting and even a sequence where the protagonists parents watch the Peter Cushing/Christopher Lee feature Horror Of Dracula on TV. Every time a new homage pops up those in the know are likely to smile with fond recognition even admiration. But while Frankenweenie is pleasant enough as a curated tour through horrors past it doesnt add much to its present. Like Burtons original short the new animated Frankenweenie starts with a crude science-fiction film-within-a-film made by New Holland resident Victor Frankenstein a lonely slightly odd kid obsessed with moviemaking and his pet dog/best friend Sparky. When Sparky is struck and killed by a car Victor (Charlie Tahan) is inconsolable until a science-class lesson about electricitys effect on dead nerves and muscles sends him scurrying back to his workspace to expose Sparkys corpse to lightning. Soon the dog is scampering around again with giant bolts in his neck and crude stitching just barely (and occasionally not) holding his body together. In the original short his transformation into a canine Frankensteins monster mostly leads to shock and disapproval from easily alarmed neighbors. The feature needs more action and more runtime so it adds a plot where a handful of other oddball kids all eager to win first prize at New Hollands science fair steal Victors technology and perform their own ill-advised animal-resurrection experiments. Theres some enjoyable mayhem in the results of those experiments but its a long time coming and it follows an hour of low-key character interaction and story business that proceeds at a moderate restrained pace and volume as if further aping early cinema rather than reaching for the zippy speed of more modern films. Burton occasionally gets some mild goofery into the subdued extended setup as when he introduces all his grim morbid kids in one science-class scene presided over by a Vincent Price caricature voiced by Martin Landau. And a later scene where that same caricature upbraids a room full of science-fearing parents for their ignorance has some edge in a country still having state-by-state debates about whether and to what degree religion should trump scientific theory in schools. But the films pro-science stance is just one of many ideas that only persists for a scene or two and never develops into anything more thematic or elaborate. Much like the business involving a weird girl (one of three characters voiced by Catherine OHara) with a creepy cat who prognosticates via poop or Victors filmmaking fetish or the question about why New Holland residents are struck by lightning so often its an idea in search of significance continuity or payoffs. Similarly most of the characters--including Victors wan sort-of love interest Elsa Van Helsing (voiced by Winona Ryder)--are underdeveloped conduits for visual gags. Theyre loving callbacks rather than the wink-wink visual puns of say the Shrek movies but theyre no substitute for a story with weight or a sense of significance. And while the stop-motion is fluid and elaborately wrought the puppets are curiously inexpressive with fixed faces and huge unblinking eyes that play well comedically but rarely convey a sense of emotion or involvement. Only Sparky himself--whose design seems to come from the protagonist of Brad Birds ""Family Dog"" in yet another reference--is fully emotive. Which leaves Frankenweenie in a strange place where the director seems to care more about past films than his cast cares about their present. Its a charming enough set of allusions but for more than half its length it doesnt particularly feel like a film itself.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1243 p.m. EDT October 4 2012A boy and his dog prove their loyalty and bravery in this sweet and clever take on the Frankenstein tale.Victor (voiced by Charlie Tahan) brings his beloved companion Sparky back from beyond in the witty instant classic Frankenweenie.(Photo Disney)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of fourVoices Charlie Tahan Winona Ryder Catherine OHara Martin Short Martin Landau; Director Tim BurtonRated PG; Runtime 1 hour 27 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideAt its core Frankenweenie is a love story between a boy and his dog.It is also a beautifully crafted homage to classic horror films a study of grief and a commentary on the mysteries of science and those who narrow-mindedly fear its advances.Drawing on director Tim Burtons trademark fascination with the macabre the tale is leavened with a touching sweetness and sharp wit. He hasnt fused those elements so appealingly since 2005s The Corpse Bride.In Frankenweenie (   1/2 out of four; rated PG; opening Friday nationwide) Burton joins forces with co-writer John August as he has on four previous films. Both the black-and-white palette and the stop-motion animation style in 3-D suit the subject matter perfectly. Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan) is a likable loner whose only true pal is his plucky lovable terrier Sparky.USA TODAY Movies View the latest news reviews amp; coverage of all things filmVictor lives in the well-ordered city of New Holland (a stand-in for suburban Burbank Calif. where Burton grew up). He is fascinated by filmmaking and science but Victors dad (Martin Short) wants him to spend more time outdoors. The results of that effort lead to Sparkys accidental death.Devastated when Sparky dies Victor drags himself to school where he spends class time sadly doodling images of his beloved dog. When he learns about electricity from his science teacher the imposing Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau)Victor resolves to harness its powers and re-animate Sparky.In a scene that directly recalls Frankenstein he revives the carcass of Sparky and to his joy his old friend returns cheerful as ever. Victor tries to hide his stitched-together creation to no avail. His classmates seek to imitate Victors efforts with bizarrely funny mutated results.One of the most captivating characters is Mr. Rzykruski modeled on Vincent Price the actor whose last role was in Burtons Edward Scissorhands. Landau deftly captures Prices distinctive vocal cadences.The tale will resonate powerfully with anyone who has loved a dog and suffered its loss. A few scenes may be a bit scary for the youngest audiences and Victors act of bringing a beloved pet back to life could require a conversation with children about not trying this at home.Stop-motion animation is the ideal medium here bringing puppets to life as it does. Sparky is adorable as a living canine and equally endearing as a stitched and bolted creation. In both forms he has the same spunky personality and eager-to-please wide-eyed grin.Based on Burtons 1984 live-action short of the same name -- and incorporating some of the original drawings -- Frankenweenie is enlivened with beguiling visuals and captivating action sequences. The science is murky at best but the underlying themes are profound and the story is equal parts funny and poignant. Its Burtons most moving film.While the directors trademark stylistic touches are clearly evident -- after his reanimation Sparky casually sheds body parts rather than fur and graveyards are a key location -- the story has an emotional heft thats unusual for Burton who has often been more concerned with the eccentric than the heart-stirring.It has Halloween classic writ large all over it but Frankenweenie is a family-friendly fantasy that will enthrall audiences any time of year.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Director Tim Burton discusses how his latest film Frankenweenie introduces kids to the theme of death and loss and actress Winona Ryder who lends her voice to the movie reveals why she thinks it is a masterpiece.

Fans of Tim Burton 1.0 rejoice ""Frankenweenie"" hearkens back to the directors salad days and in turn to the old-school horror classics that inspired him in the first place. If youve been jonesing for suburban outsiders monster-movie shout-outs and Winona Ryder this is the movie for you. In this remake of Burtons live-action 1984 short young Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan) loves science and scary movies but has no real friends besides his devoted dog Sparky. When the lovable hound gets hit by a car (take heed parents -- its no coincidence that the local cinema is showing ""Bambi"") Victor is inconsolable until he sees his science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau) make a dead frogs limbs twitch by connecting them to electricity. Before long Victor is digging up Sparkys grave elevating him to the sky during an electrical storm (lucky for him his town of New Holland has them every night) and before long Sparkys alive. Alive Even if his stitched-on tail has a tendency to fly off during enthusiastic wagging. Victor tries to keep his reanimated pet a secret but soon his creepy classmates figure out whats going on and in an attempt to keep Victor from besting them at the upcoming science fair they all electrify dead animals and accidentally create horrible beasts that threaten to destroy the whole town. This autumn has seen something of a bumper crop of cool horror-comedies aimed at kids and while this film isnt as tightly plotted as ""ParaNorman"" (John Augusts script starts to run out of steam before the big finale peps things back up) or as gag-a-minute as ""Hotel Transylvania"" the black-and-white stop-motion-animated ""Frankenweenie"" provides the same jolts of pleasure and originality that Burton delivered with his debut feature the wonderfully eccentric ""Pee-Wees Big Adventure."" Here Burton reunites with several members of his repertory -- besides Ryder (who plays the niece of Mayor Burgemeister a nifty reference to the Rankin-Bass animated classic ""Santa Claus Is Comin to Town"") and Landau Catherine OHara and Martin Short voice most of the movies adults -- and revisits favorite themes but ""Frankenweenie"" doesnt feel like just a greatest-hits retread. The film has a timeless feel (the cars and appliances are from the 50s although the plastic water bottles arent) but offers messages that couldnt be more contemporary particularly the idea of science itself as something that people fear and distrust. ""They like the things science gives them"" Mr. Rzykruski says of the local mob ""but not the questions science asks."" Perhaps boldest of all is Mr. Frankensteins admission that ""sometimes adults dont know what theyre talking about."" Its this embrace of kids and their creativity -- not just tolerating a dark and twisted look at the world but actually championing it -- that put Burton on the map in the first place and with ""Frankenweenie"" we discover that the director can still summon that sense of wonder after all these years.

The resulting homage to Frankenstein in particular and horror movies in general is exquisite macabre mayhem and a kind of reanimation all its own. A lovingly detailed work of stop-motion construction in black and white and story-enhancing 3-D the feature-length fantasy began life back in 1984 as a live-action short. But stop-motion animation was always what the filmmaker had in mind. And with this stitching together of material old and new three decades of familiarity with Burtons obsessions pay off Frankenweenie is a cool little flipbook of historical Burtonian style. It even brings back old friends including Beetlejuices Winona Ryder and Catherine OHara. The movie is a romp of escalating ""horror"" as weird suburban neighbor kids (are there any other kind in Burtonburg?) goad the young inventor (and the unstable Sparky 2.0) into danger. And the ghoulishness is in the details the most charming of which are the perfectly lugubrious line readings by Ed Woods Martin Landau as a science teacher by way of every role Vincent Price ever played in every movie that inspired Tim Burton to become the wonderfully strange filmmaker he is.

A distinctly Burtonesque gothic comedy the black-and-white ""Frankenweenie"" lovingly acknowledges a wide range of classic monster movies while showcasing the filmmakers trademark blend of creepy imagery and compassion for juvenilia. While not Burtons greatest accomplishment its his most definitive work in years. Like the half-hour short ""Frankenweenie"" upgrades Mary Shelleys famous tale to the setting of countless Burton films. Among bland California suburbs not unlike those found in ""Edward Scissorhands"" Burton finds middle schooler and only child Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan) leading a solitary existence making 8mm monster movies with his best pal Sparky a peppy canine whose companionship shields Victor from the demands of the outside world. READ MORE The Tim Burton Interview On His Return to Frankenweenie and Why Hes Thinking About Going Indie Even before we arrive at Sparkys untimely demise and Victors now-familiar application of lightening to rejuvenate his dead pet ""Frankenweenie"" constructs a stylishly gloomy atmosphere that hints at the creepiness hovering just above Victors bland surroundings. The Stepford-like community is populated by grinning blue-collar archetypes further exaggerated by Burtons angular character designs and stark colorless imagery which mirrors Victors warped perspective of a limited environment. More than simply inhabiting Victors perspective however ""Frankenweenie"" offers an entire universe of spooky reference points to eke out the tension between the towns conservative values and the prospects of more daring possibilities lurking in the shadows. Of course the voice of reason comes from an unusual place Victor receives sage advice exclusively from his Russian science teacher (Martin Landau) an energetically loony mustache-twirling mad scientist ironically positioned as the movies voice of reason. (Although he hasnt done much lately Landaus charmingly goofy accent helps to distinguish his most enjoyable role in years.) While Victor epitomizes Burtons longstanding sympathies for alienated dark souls its the teacher who provides an exit strategy from the ordinary life challenges Victor faces by encouraging him to think outside the box. Victors true foe is not mortality but the comparatively insipid expectations imposed on him. As Victors parents fret over his social development he attempts to avoid participation in the local softball team but those problems dwindle in value when Sparky is hit by a car. The dogs sudden death and the solemn teary aftermath introduce an abrupt poetic sadness to the proceedings that instantly deepen the movies thematic reach. Then comes the abnormal twist. Facing a difficult rite of passage Victor chooses to ignore its presumed boundaries. After witnessing his science teacher reanimate a dead frog with electricity the boy decides to exhume Sparkys corpse and expose it to a storm above his attic; naturally the experiment brings the decayed animal back to life a mixed blessing for everyone involved. As Victor gets the chance to upend the typical hardships of facing death for the first time Burton wryly updates the conventional coming-of-age mold. In this version of childhood nostalgia lifes harsher mysteries can be unwritten. From the first act onward Burton explores the emotional arc of a death drama in reverse. When another neighborhood kid Edgar -- a leering hunchback and dead ringer for the Igor role -- happens upon Victors achievement the scheming classmate aims to capitalize on the young scientists discovery for the upcoming science fair. Blackmailed into sharing his technology Victor winds up contributing to a rash of lightening-based experiments as more classmates capitalize on his discovery leading to the chaotic outbreak of a supernatural menagerie that wreaks havoc on the town during the delightfully wacky final act. Even during these moments ""Frankenweenie"" retains a modest handcrafted feel due in large part to its retrograde use of stop-motion animation that never falls back on advanced computer trickery. Less ostentatious in terms of spectacle and script than Burtons ""Corpse Bride"" the new movie is nevertheless more narratively refined as it teases out the restrictions of all-ages entertainment. Earlier this year ""ParaNorman"" featured the similar plight of a young loner saving a town from undead forces but it saved the prevailing message about coming to terms with the past for a climactic tell-all speech. ""Frankenweenie"" smartly channels its insight into the modest storyline. John Augusts screenplay is littered with life lessons that deconstruct the myths enshrouding a sheltered youth. ""Its easy to promise the impossible"" Victor learns from his higher ups when their predictions that hell get over his grief fail to come true. Hes not the only one in defense mode. His candid science teacher faces oppression from the community for preaching unvarnished truths. ""You dont understand science because you are afraid of it"" he tells the school board and while the struggle mirrors contemporary debate about the role of evolution in public school curriculum in a larger sense it reflects the risks associated with a rich imagination. Burton counteracts the pressure to play it safe with possibly the most subversive denouement found in an animated Disney movie ""Sometimes adults dont know what theyre talking about."" Only Burton could make this the final takeaway of a movie ostensibly marketed toward children. Elaborating on that idea the silly mayhem in the closing sequence is a gleeful defiance of the rationality to which the grownups in ""Frankenweenie"" adhere. Burtons id explodes onto the screen with a plethora of demonic mutated critters ranging from naughty giant sea monkeys straight out of ""Gremlins"" to a towering reptile that pays blatant homage to ""Godzilla."" Each contributes to the impression of a magical playtime stemming from Burtons uniquely grim toy chest. Despite its spectacular combination of artistry and insight however ""Frankenweenie"" doesnt have the storyline to match. Hardly more than twice the length of the original short the movie barely delivers on its potential before halting the promising trajectory with a tidy resolution. But its never less than a satisfactory showcasing of the precise ingredients that established Burton in the first place. In the wake of the directors ill-received ""Dark Shadows"" update and the critically maligned ""Alice in Wonderland"" the reminder couldnt arrive at a more prescient moment. In that regard ""Frankenweenie"" is a tale of resurrection in more ways than one. Criticwire grade B+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? Disney releases Frankenweenie October 5. The dare elements may scare off some families but Burtons established brand and the dearth of quality animation this year may help the movie gain considerable commercial appeal during its first few weeks of release. Whether it can gain any traction during awards season remains an open-ended question but it will garner plenty of attention as the opening night film at Fantastic Fest and other media events.

Looks like someone didnt do their research. The original ""Frankenweenie"" short was not stop-motion nor was it animated in any way. It was a live action short film. Perhaps what the reviewer is thinking of is ""Vincent"" another earlier Tim Burton short which is in fact animated using stop-motion. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Frankenweenie Fair Director Tim Burton. Cast Voices of Charlie Tahan Winona Ryder Martin Short Catherine OHara. Rating Rated PG for thematic elements scary images and action. His latest auteur effort Disneys ""Frankenweenie"" lands somewhere in between. An embellishment on a live-action short that he directed nearly three decades ago Burtons kid-friendly parody of ""Frankenstein"" is a work of stop-motion animation with a similar look to his 2005 hit ""Corpse Bride"" with two big differences It is filmed in state-of-the-art 3-D and retro black-and-white. Its another juxtaposition in tone which may strike the viewer as either inventive or unnecessary. But theres no question it looks fantastic (with a little boost from CGI animation). The attention to detail from the grease and gleam of a bicycle chain to the thin cloud of smoke rising from the lightning-struck corpse of the titular pooch rivals that of Pixar and thats saying a lot. As for the story well much like the original Frankensteins monster it is a haphazard assemblage of well-aged source materials jolted back to life with new technology but it isnt quite as sophisticated as one might hope. The main character is a boy named Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan) growing up in a town called New Holland in what looks like the early 1970s. His parents (Martin Short and Catherine OHara) worry that he is too much of an outsider but in truth he is one of the more normal-seeming residents of the community. He sports only a hint of black eye shadow for example as if he were merely flirting with the goth subculture unlike the snaggletoothed hunchbacked Edgar ""E"" Gore or the Slavic science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau) who looks like a wax figure from Madame Tussauds whose face has begun to melt. The Addams Family ambiance has the odd effect of undercutting the sense of foreboding when Victor decides to tap the power of lightning to bring his beloved pet Sparky (get it?) back from the dead. Sure the undead dogs tail falls off every once in a while and flies crawl out through the seams of his roughly stitched pelt but considering all the other unsavory denizens of New Holland he hardly seems like a reason to panic. Of course one cannot meddle with the laws of nature without expecting a backlash and inevitably ""Frankenweenie"" explodes into full-on ""Pet Sematary"" mayhem complete with Burtons particular visual wit. Its all perfectly entertaining but never really reaches the heights of hilarity perhaps because everything about the plot is underdeveloped. A pair of love interests -- one for Victor one for Sparky -- are there just to be there and the vintage setting seems to have been chosen just for the art direction as evidenced by anachronisms ranging from a reference to ""computer simulation"" to the inevitable spectacle of angry townsfolk chasing Sparky with torches and garden tools. For all his visual invention Burton has a tendency to forget that the best surprises arise out of the idiosyncrasies of fully developed characters and not from the clever manipulation of familiar stereotypes.

This summers ""Dark Shadows"" was even worse thanks to a batty script and erratic direction. So what a pleasure to see that the Burton we know and love is back. His latest endeavor the playful and sweetly weird ""Frankenweenie"" is a welcome return to form for Burton who helmed such iconic films as ""Beeetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands."" Using imaginative and impressive puppets to bring characters to life Burton crams the new stop-motion animated film with his favorite themes -- the pain of ostracization a celebration of differences and a love for old movies -- then weaves those elements into the framework of James Whales ""Frankenstein"" film from 1931. He tinkers with the classic story quite a bit. The protagonist a lonely boy named Victor (voice of Charlie Tahan) revives his beloved dead pooch Sparky after it was nailed by a car. The Mary Shelley-inspired storyline gives Burton a chance to cut loose with a crazy monster mash-up finale and a rather bold message that heralds scientific advances when used for the right reasons.Advertisement In more ways than one the lusciously animated black-and-white production -- shot to affectionately mirror the texture of old horror flicks -- signals Burtons return to his roots.""Frankenweenie"" expands on his same-titled live-action Disney short from 1984. The redo while not as innovative as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" -- which he co-wrote and produced -- reminds us how weirdly charming and captivating the director can be. As usual Burton runs into some of the problems that have always plagued him. The pacing -- especially at the beginning -- isnt always smooth and the 3-D adds nothing except an inflated ticket price.Mostly though this is a rebound with Burton and co-screenwriter John August (""Dark Shadows"") mining familiar themes played out in his best films -- ""Ed Wood"" and ""Edward Scissorhands."" Certainly it looks terrific. Burton and his team of animators have stylishly captured the 70s-era burbs. Their small town of New Holland a place where all the kids look like theyre love children of Edward Gorey is a feast for the eyes. But be warned Some of what theyve dreamed up is ghoulish so parents should think twice about taking young children. However if dark and twisted is how you like your Burton movies youre in luck. There are quirky misfits aplenty a standout being the serious blonde ""Weird Girl"" who believes the poop of her kitty Mr. Whiskers portends the future. There are also numerous clever movie references. Martin Short and Catherine OHara deserve props for each voicing three characters including Victors parents.Add in an East European science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau deadpan hilarious as a Vincent Price clone) who considers Americans idiots for fearing science a mob of angry parents and a potential romance for Victor with the visiting niece (Winona Ryder) of the towns bulb-bellied mayor and you have a gallery of distinct characters that deserve a Burton copyright. They all make for silly amusing company to keep and like the film itself inspire hope that Burton is just as poised to bounce back for his next live-action feature.""Frankenweenie""    Rating PG (thematic elements scary images and action)With the voices of Charlie Tahan Martin Landau Martin Short Catherine OHara Winona RyderDirector Tim Burton Running time 1 hour 27 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

The man who once thrilled us with the surreal adventures of manchild Pee-wee Herman moved us with the lovelorn longing of Edward Scissorhands and had the bipartisan gall to incinerate all of Congress in Mars Attacks is now a fatigued company man. Once Tinseltowns defiant black sheep hes become a full-on Hollywood stooge (witness CGI-heavy mediocrity like Alice in Wonderland or this years moribund Dark Shadows remake). It makes sense that Burton would return to one of his earliest works the flawed yet promising black-and-white 1984 short Frankenweenie to try and revivify the spirits. He nearly gets there As in its live-action predecessor this 3-D stop-motion-animated redo tells the story of introverted suburban kid Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) who harnesses some inclement weather to bring his dead dog Sparky back to life. Burtons visual imagination runs wild Students at Victors school resemble horror-movie characters like Igor or icons like Boris Karloff. Delightful throwaway gags are plentiful from the dour defacement of the Disney logo to a Hello Kitty gravestone. Theres even an inspired pet-cemetery resurrection that quickly turns into a Destroy All Monsters-style free-for-all. What still eludes Burton is the ability to deepen the superficial allure of his visions. Victor is a brooding bore defined more by his skeletal frame and abyss-black hair than by any genuine human emotion (compare him with the complicated protagonist of the thematically similar movingly messier ParaNorman). And though the tale demands a darker outcome the director disappointingly goes the Mouse House happy-ending route with a reprise of the original short films finale--one that somehow plays with even more cringeworthy sentimentality.

With Frankenweenie he adapts his own work--the first animated short he ever produced for a major film studio and the one which semi-famously got him fired from Disney back in 84. Given the crappiness of the studios Reagan-era output that has to be seen as a giant badge of honor or something. Working for ""the man"" generally entails a minimum of boat rocking and originality and for all of his faults Burtons vision is still unlike any other filmmakers.In Burtons films introverts have access to hidden worlds bat caves the afterlife wonderlands and the surprisingly comfortable interiors of giant peaches all of which become the inner worlds of lonely people. Its kind of remarkable that this entire sensibility sprang so fully formed in that original short.Its in the new full-length as well. You pretty much know the life trajectory of any kid named Victor Frankenstein--sooner or later hes going to tamper with the fundamental forces of nature theres going to be some low-pressure cells moving across the tristate and suddenly he has conquered death via the medium of lightning. Names are destiny yall thats why Adolf and Humbert Humbert are historically unpopular handles for newborns.Film Details Frankenweenie RatingNR GenreComedy Running Time29 More Info So yes when his weenie dog Sparky is struck by a car and killed Victor is inspired by his new science teacher to generate some impressive innovations in the untapped field of reanimation. Victor voiced by Charlie Tahan intends to submit his reassembled and electrically resurrected dog at his schools science fair but hes actually motivated by a broken heart.Naturally any Tim Burton joint is going to include references to vintage films and most of the classic Universal monsters get little tributes in the form of character designs comic bits and minor plot points. Theres a hunchbacked Igor-looking kid in Victors science class a bully who looks like Lon Chaney and one pretty great Bride of Frankenstein-hairstyle gag.The films heavy Mr. Burgemeister is a happy reference to the villainous Burgermeister Meisterburger from the terrifying stop-motion childhood classic Santa Claus Is Comin to Town. Voiced by Martin Short who also plays Victors father Burgemeister is a fussy bitchy next-door neighbor who hates the Frankensteins and their mutt. The character pays tribute to the old Saul Bass Burgermeister puppet design His mouth is a creepily undulant slit and he has some kind of weird supernumerary homodontia thing going on--something like four times the usual number of teeth all of which appear to be incisors. In fact theres a whole orthodontic visual approach to all of the puppet designs particularly with Victors science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (voiced by the scene-stealing Martin Landau) whose mouth kind of resembles that of the Mouth of Sauron character from the four-hour nerd version of The Return of the King.The dog is great. Sparky isnt a cartoon character as much as a behaviorally accurate little canine which is 10 times cuter than if the script had gone in a Dreamworks Animation direction with like Ben Stiller voicing the dog and then a song by Smash Mouth or some damn thing. Sparky--both the live and reanimated iterations--circles the ground before curling up in a little ball intently studies the backyards fence line and wags his whole butt whenever he sees Burgemeisters poodle.Although Burton likes to create imaginative storybook worlds (which sometimes overwhelm his characters) this evocation of 1950s suburbia is rendered and lit with realism and understatement all the better to contrast with the very Tim Burton-y character designs. Victors classmate Elsa Van Helsing voiced by Winona Ryder has long spindly stick legs; many of Victors acquaintances are ball-shaped; pretty much everyone has dark circles around his or her eyes.The imaginative world of New Holland is lively enough that a lot of critics are probably going to say stupid things like ""You dont even notice that its shot in black-and-white"" Not to be all contrary but yes you do notice that its shot in black-and-white. Youll also be aware that youre watching it through the polarized lenses of 3-D glasses because youre observant. Critics man.Burton has always been an uneven storyteller and a dissident critic might even suggest that Batman was a low point in the directors casual relationship with narrative. That seems to be a controversial position even despite Robert Wuhls dialogue the whole Vicki Vale character the worst songs Prince ever wrote a rewrite by the horrible Warren Skaaren during the 1988 guild strike and the inexplicable killing of the Joker. Frankenweenie scripted by John August and based on a screenplay by Lenny Ripps from Burtons original story is tight and brief hitting all the marks youd expect from an animated kids film and enlivened by Burtons visual style. The man should make more small movies like this one.

The beginning is the end is the beginning I suppose for Tim Burtons career. His 1984 short ""Frankenweenie"" about a boy bringing his deceased dog back to life saw the goth auteur-to-be fired from Disney. Yet here we are nearly three decades later staring down a feature-length version of ""Frankenweenie"" greenlit by the very same studio seeing Burton return to classical stop-motion animation (and even black-and-white at that) after the numbing digital parades that were ""Alice in Wonderland"" and this years ""Dark Shadows."" The Frankensteins young son Victor (voiced by Charlie Tahan) is an fledgling inventor who seriously adores his dog Sparky. Mr. Frankenstein wants Victor to broaden his interests though and try out for sports and his first baseball game sadly results in Sparkys running into the street after a fly ball and being struck by a car. The boy is despondent until his intense science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (Martin Landau) suggests that a body could be brought back to life with an electrical surge. Once Sparky is resuscitated Victor tries -- and fails -- to keep him a secret setting off a chain reaction of classmates resurrecting their own dead pets to calamitous effect. Its amusing to see the petty escalation of a science fair of all things serve as the main plot thrust this time and even though screenwriter John August (""Big Fish"" ""Corpse Bride"") worked to expand a 30-minute short thrice over theres very little apparent strain to show for it. Sparky ultimately gets to serve as much more of a hero than a pariah. Even just enjoying more early adventures with him chasing cats and flirting with neighboring dogs makes it seem worthwhile and it feels all the more remarkable for how little dialogue is used for stretches at a time. Augusts dialogue is often snappy when used though -- ""You told me youd bring [Sparky] back if you could"" ""But it was impossible when I said that"" --- and theres even room for one decent poop joke amid all the cleverness. Just as Wes Andersons diorama-like approach was splendidly suited to the animation style in ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" Burtons trademark aesthetic translates well to stop-motion film as per ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" ""Corpse Bride"" and now ""Frankenweenie."" The town of New Holland (where better to have a climactic windmill?) is essentially the quaint 50s-like neighborhood of ""Edward Scissorhands"" with tulips in place of shrubs full of ""modest homes at modest prices"" and filled with colorful characters ranging from the hunchbacked Edgar ""E"" Gore (Atticus Shaffer) to the hilariously wide-eyed Weird Girl (Catherine OHara who also plays Victors mom; Martin Short voices his dad and both actors fill other roles as well). Eccentric knowing details litter each frame. Mr. Rzykruski rants about how lightning strikes are more comparable to ""electrons fleeing to the Land of Opportunity"" than anything else mocks the small minds of the fearful township and gives off a distinct Vincent Price vibe. The original shorts ""Bride of Frankenstein"" nod remains intact. The Frankensteins neighbors are the Van Helsings including young daughter Elsa (Winona Ryder) and the mayor next door is very much designed in the mold of trout-mouthed Rankin-Bass villains. Even Burton regular and Hammer veteran Christopher Lee manages a fitting live-action cameo of sorts. Whats more the nostalgic touches are reinforced by the era-appropriate paranoia and the third acts full-on creature-feature approach. ""Frankenweenie"" has the bad luck to arrive somewhat on the heels of ""ParaNorman"" a superior 80s horror throwback with its own messages of acceptance. However there are still plenty of casually macabre gags -- for instance Sparky chasing the water that sprays out of his seams just after drinking it -- and slightly scary bits to enjoy here. Its the best thing with Burtons name on it in the past five years regardless.

TWITTER Tim Burtons 3D stop-motion film features voice work from Martin Short Martin Landau and Winona Ryder and tells the story of a boy who brings his beloved dog back from the dead. That Tim Burtons new film Frankenweenie is an expansion of a half-hour live-action piece he made for Disney in 1984 merely serves to punctuate the fact that five of the eight films the director has made since 2000 have been remakes of previous films or TV shows. Although this nominally clever take-off of Frankenstein about a boys successful effort to ""re-animate"" his late pet dog is distinctive as the first black-and-white 3D stop-motion animated production of this new three-dimensional era it is nonetheless imaginative in a highly familiar and ultimately tedious way. Burtons name the 3D calling card and small-fry appeal will yield good returns in line with his previous animated productions The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride. PHOTOS Fall Movie Preview 2012 Major New Releases From Spielberg Jackson Tarantino the Wachowskis Burton and More ""I dont want him to turn out you know weird"" says Father Frankenstein as if there were ever any choice in Tim Burtons universe. In a blandly uniform postwar suburban housing development that looks like the next town down from the one in Edward Scissorhands skinny science geek Victor Frankenstein loses his beloved hound Sparky in an auto accident. As in the original short the pooch is ceremoniously buried under a large tombstone in a creepy cemetery on a hill. But a science class demonstration of how the application of electric current can make a dead frog kick its legs gives Victor a bright idea about how inject some spark back into poor old Sparky -- which surrounded by all manner of flashing and fritzing jerry-bilt equipment he manages to do up in the attic on a dark and stormy night. While frequent Burton screenwriter John August has added considerably to the limited concept of the short by inventing a whole second act in which Victors fellow students steal his secret and thereby bring other dead animals to life he has failed to eliminate one major irritant Victors compulsion not to reveal his accomplishment to his parents. Since you know its only a matter of time until they find out all of Victors frantic efforts to hide his deed are extremely tiresome which was particularly harmful to the original 1984 version. PHOTOS Second Times the Charm 15 of Hollywoods Most Notable Remakes This time when the other kids get out their kites wires and electrodes to zap new life into an assortment of critters that includes a cat rat and Sea-Monkeys the result is a small army of monsters seemingly on loan from Gremlins Gamara and Burtons own Mars Attacks But while they cackle and stomp and make funny faces as they invade a festival celebration on Main Street these beasts working under a PG imperative dont actually do anything particularly untoward which is consistent with the toothless not to mention secondhand feeling of the entire enterprise. Theres a palpable sense of Burtons past catching up with him here; Sparkys stitched-together body recalls Edward Scissorhands as does Victors pronounced outsider status while the goth kids huge eyes and mostly spindly torsos are carry-overs from most of the directors work. Creatively the detailed work with the stop-motion puppets horror film-derived production design and visual effects bizarre costumes and hair crisply evocative monochromatic cinematography and loopy musical score are all more than commendable. But just as they pay homage to a beloved old filmmaking style all these elements feel like second-generation photocopies of things Burton has done before. It all feels pretty rote and empty drained of the old Burtonjuice.

The traditional tale of a boy and his dog gets charmingly warped treatment in ""Frankenweenie"" Tim Burtons latest spooky-fun exercise in animation and reanimation. A black-and-white stop-motion toon that pays loving tribute to Hollywood creature features of yesteryear this beautifully designed canine-resurrection saga feels somewhat fittingly stitched together from stray narrative parts but nonetheless evinces a level of discipline and artistic coherence missing from the directors recent live-action efforts. Fusing gentle sentimental emotions and a classically Burtonian obsession with all things morbid and macabre Disneys Oct. 5 release should fetch lively returns from devotees and general audiences of all ages. Though decisively superior to ""Dark Shadows"" the years other Burton-directed release ""Frankenweenie"" merits stronger comparisons with Focus/Laikas recent ""ParaNorman"" another stop-motion spookfest centered around a young boys adventures with the undead. The protagonist here is Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan) who lives with his doting parents (Catherine OHara Martin Short) and his faithful bull terrier Sparky in the Dutch-influenced 1970s town of New Holland. Yet Victor might be described more correctly as a resident of Burtonville a now-universally recognized township where a spirit of deadpan whimsy prevails and even minor characters have been shaped to resemble Igor or Frankensteins monster. A shy science-minded kid Victor spends most of his time cooking up weird experiments in his attic laboratory and casting Sparky as the star of his homemade monster movies one of which is amusingly highlighted early on. But when Sparky chases a ball into the street and meets a tragic end the boys grief is soon overshadowed by a thrill of dark possibility Absorbing the lessons of his gravely eccentric Vincent Price-inspired science teacher Mr. Rzykruski (wonderfully voiced with an Eastern European accent by Martin Landau) Victor sets out to bring the dog back to life. A pet-cemetery raid and a few lightning bolts later Sparky lives -- a bit more decomposed and apt to shed body parts than usual but otherwise still the same sweet lovable not terribly bright pooch. At this juncture John Augusts screenplay begins to elaborate on the story template provided by Burtons 1984 short film also titled ""Frankenweenie."" With boy and dog supplying little in the way of dramatic conflict the story borrows a page from ""Re-Animator"" hinging on the nefarious activities of Victors classmates -- including the loathsome Edgar (Atticus Shaffer) and the entrancing Weird Girl (OHara again) -- and their somewhat ill-motivated determination to steal this confounding new technology. Tucked into the proceedings are some intriguing ideas about the beauty and mystery of science and the ways it can be abused or misunderstood by the small-minded. Yet whether or not it turns moppets into biochemistry fiends the film tilts firmly in the direction of fantasy; any science here is strictly and playfully of the mad variety. As demonstrated by ""Corpse Bride"" and the Henry Selick-directed ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" stop-motion is an ideal medium for realizing Burtons unique worlds of whimsy. The labor-intensive nature of the process which in this case involved about 33 animators working to produce five seconds of film per week apiece imposes a necessary degree of focus and pre-planning in the story department -- a useful constraint for a filmmaker whose visual imagination sometimes overwhelms his narrative sense. Still a certain inertia persists in the storytelling here primarily in the films patched-together midsection. The characters including Victor himself are not particularly well defined and once the pictures twisted premise and playfully grim tone have been established even its more outlandish formulations are fairly foreseeable. Apart from the simple joy of watching Sparky brought to endearing life (a feat achieved with no fewer than 15 puppets) the pleasures of this willfully derivative movie are not of surprise but recognition -- of catching the James Whale reference when a bouffanted poodle gets zapped by lightning or the Godzilla allusion foreshadowed by the presence of a Japanese kid (James Hiroyuki Liao) in the ensemble. If these tie-ins arent clever enough Burton loyalists will have fun identifying the numerous echoes of the helmers prior work. The flat suburban landscape of Rick Heinrichs production design looks awfully similar to that of ""Edward Scissorhands"" (likewise modeled on the directors native Burbank) albeit with the bright colors drained away in favor of a richly expressive monochrome palette whose distinct shadings and textures benefit appreciably from 3D. The black-and-white lensing (by d.p. Peter Sorg) and moviemaking subplot hark back to ""Ed Wood"" Burtons last feature shot sans color; and as a gloomy girl-next-door type voice thesp Winona Ryder more or less resuscitates Lydia from ""Beetlejuice."" August brings to the material the same earnest accessible strokes apparent in his previous collaborations with Burton (""Big Fish"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and ""Corpse Bride"") signaled by the emotional flurries in Danny Elfmans score and the touching if not entirely natural sight of Victor quietly weeping on more than one occasion. Amid the outstanding craft contributions including seamless vfx shots topnotch voicework and a refreshingly unobtrusive evocation of mid-70s America special mention must be made of the puppeteers at MacKinnon amp; Saunders who have a field day cooking up creepy variations on mummies sea monsters and other horror-movie denizens.
