Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 26 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Aug. 25 2011 608PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The opening frames tell us all we need to know about Ned. There he is long hair and beard and loopy grin tending his organic food stand handing out free strawberries to a hungry little girl and a baggie of weed to a uniformed cop. Yep a cop - Ned is generous to a fault and naive beyond the point of imbecility. Of course the kind-hearted goof is a staple of dumbed-down comedies but in Paul Rudds hands this guy is different. Hes truly palpably loveable and Our Idiot Brother should be too. Yet it isnt. What goes wrong? Not what typically goes wrong but more about that later. For now its sufficient to know that Ned after a stint in the slammer thanks to his marijuana largesse heads back to the farm only to learn that his girlfriend has dumped him for another field hand and whats worse she aint parting with his beloved canine companion. Homeless jobless and dogless our beta male eventually wends his way to the big city where he finds rotating shelter in the homes of his three very alpha sisters plus their significant others along with a child or two. So begins the first problem The ensemble is unwieldy and the attendant yarn much too cluttered. Lets add it up. Sister Liz (Emily Mortimer) is an earnest mom living in hip Brooklyn with her husband the documentary-maker (Steve Coogan) a hypocritical liberal with a snooty accent and a roving eye. Their son burdened with the name of ""River"" is one of those abundantly protected kids suffering from underexposure to video games and rough sports. Meanwhile in the West Village sis Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is a Vanity Fair scribe pursuing a tell-all story about some rich royal with a checkered past. Shes also caught up in a slow-to-bud romance with her friend Jeremy. Finally elsewhere in Manhattan theres Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) an aggressive bi-sexual currently dedicating herself to a lesbian relationship albeit with occasional time-outs for male visitors. Already thats quite the tally which puts director Jesse Peretz in an immediate quandary How to introduce and then juggle so many characters all embedded in their separate crises? Answer Haphazardly. Peretz wants the pace brisk but settles for choppy - much of this flick looks to have been edited in a food processor. The conceit doesnt help since Ned is obliged to bounce erratically among his sisterly trio inadvertently wreaking havoc as he goes between wife and hubby parent and child journalist and subject lesbian and lover. Hes here hes there hes everywhere and nowhere - at this stage choppy gets downright messy. Which bring us to the atypical problem. Usually in these cluttered affairs the comedy is as manic as the surroundings and desperately swinging for the big yuks the movie ends as just another loud strikeout. Not here. To the contrary the over-plotted script is consistently underplayed which might have proved admirable if more of it worked. Instead all setup and no punchline entire scenes come and go with scant comic payoff. The quiet treatment just seems weirdly at odds with the wacky premise. Excuse the heresy but you almost find yourself wishing theyd inject a little Adam Sandler into the mix. The exception is the title role. Admittedly Ned isnt a bundle of hilarity either but he is something much rarer - genuinely and contagiously likeable in a Capra-esque sort of way. Hes much more than a dim-but-decent cliche precisely because of what hes not - not cynical not world-weary not self-pitying and unlike Sandler not annoying. This time the underplaying pays dividends as Rudd keeps him from sliding past Capra-esque into Capra-corn. He gives Ned an insouciant amiability that doesnt feel sentimental - just laidback more childlike than childish and oddly assured. Consequently among the secondary characters men and women alike are attracted to him despite themselves and its fun to watch their faces registering surprise as if to say ""It cant be that Im actually falling for this can it?"" Well we fall along with them. Strange then how Our Idiot Brother wastes its lone asset - theres not enough idiot and far too many boring savants.

By Peter Rainer Film critic August 26 2011 Save for later Saved Paul Rudd is shown in a scene from the new film Our Idiot Brother. Nicole Rivelli/The Weinstein Co./AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Paul Rudd stars as the ""idiot"" in ""Our Idiot Brother"" a genial comedy that is too pokey for its own good. Rudds Ned Rochlin recently jailed for selling pot to a uniformed police officer is released into the world without a job a home or even his beloved dog Willie Nelson. (His former girlfriend with whom he lived hippie-style on a biodynamic farm claims custody.)He ends up imposing himself on each of his three very different sisters played by Elizabeth Banks Zooey Deschanel and Emily Mortimer. The locations range from Brooklyns Park Slope to the West Village from bohemia to the gleaming offices of Vanity Fair magazine. Throughout it all Ned is not idiotic exactly just affably clueless.The cast members beginning with Rudd have an improvisatory ease and the director Jesse Peretz working from a script by Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgall doesnt indulge in the sort of nail-on-the-head comedy that currently reigns. Still ""Our Idiot Brother"" too often ambles into inconsequentiality. And predictably Ned becomes a kind of family savior - the idiot becomes the sage. Its Frank Capra for dummies.

Our Idiot Brother (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Our Idiot Brother (R) This drab comedy about a wise idiot and his three sisters insults the viewers intelligence. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald8/26/2011 Editor rating 1 The titular hero of the drab comedy Our Idiot Brother is the well-meaning lunkhead Ned (Paul Rudd) a hopeless optimist who wants to believe nothing other than good about people (he could pass for Forrest Gumps younger brother). That innocence gets Ned arrested in the opening scene in which he sells some pot to a uniformed police officer who asks him if hes holding. Ned feels outraged and violated by the cops betrayal but he gets over it almost immediately. There is little that can ruffle Ned and his shaggy-dog easygoing demeanor for long When he gets out of jail and finds out his girlfriend has dumped him and wants him out of the house they share he moves in with his mother then couch-surfs his way through the lives of his three sisters each of whom is going through a crisis Liz (Emily Mortimer) whose filmmaker husband (Steve Coogan) is cheating on her; Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) a Vanity Fair writer trying to make a name for herself in the industry; and Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) who lives with her devoted girlfriend (Rashida Jones) but winds up pregnant after a casual night of sex with an artist (Hugh Dancy). Our Idiot Brother which was directed by Jesse Peretz (The Ex) and written by his sister Evgenia and her husband David Schisgall attracted an ensemble cast far better than this puny material deserved. The talented actors are game but they are done in by the shallow nature of their characters none of whom behaves in a manner remotely resembling real life (they dont really seem to be related either). Even the usually likable Rudd cant do much with the enigmatic Ned who often behaves exactly in the idiotic manner hes accused of. The film itself doesnt seem to know what to make of Ned Are we supposed to find his stupidity endearing? In the last 30 minutes the filmmakers opt for the sentimental route turning Ned into a teacher of Life Lessons and Important Truths all of which he will convey to his sisters despite their constantly complaining. Yep the tail end of the summer movie season is definitely here. Hurry fall hurry.

"Our Idiot brother review Which one is the idiot again? |       NJ.com comments Our Idiot brother review Which one is the idiot again? Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 26 2011 at 821 AM View/Post Comments Nicole RivelliJanet Montgomery and Paul Rudd in aOur Idiot Brother.a Our Idiot Brother"" -- everyone has one. Maybe its a brother-in-law. Or an old college roommate. Or a childhood friend. Or that guy you worked a summer job with once. Or maybe its even a sister or a niece. But this happy moron has managed to grow into adulthood without ever apparently growing up -- or accepting any responsibility putting down any roots or beginning any career. What an idiot Right? ""Our Idiot Brother"" starts by focusing on a dope like that a pot-smoking small-town farmer named Ned who suddenly finds himself homeless. So his New York City sisters tell him to come on down and move in. Bad idea. ""Our Idiot Brother"" has a great cast -- in addition to the sweetly clueless Paul Rudd as Ned it stars Emily Mortimer Elizabeth Banks and Zooey Deschanel as his sisters and rounds out things with Rashida Jones (as Deschanels nerdy girlfriend) and Steve Coogan (as Mortimers nasty husband). But it doesnt necessarily have much more on the ball than Rudds dopey doper. For one thing there are a few too many characters here -- and not enough development. We understand that Neds supposed to be a dim slacker the sort of tie-dyed sheep of the family. Except Banks is still struggling to make it as a freelance writer. Deschanel does bad stand-up comedy and lives in a free-for-all loft. They hardly seem to have it together either which makes it difficult to see exactly why Ned stands out as such an obvious loser. In fact hes not so much a Cheech-and-Chong burnout as he is a simple innocent someone who thinks the best of everyone. That means that people tend to open up to him. And because he cant keep a secret that leads to all sorts of trouble. Which also unfortunately leads to all sorts of predictable predicaments we can see coming from a long way off -- and a pat ending in which yes the three sisters finally realize that their idiot brother may not be such an idiot after all. Perhaps if the filmmakers were sharper the jokes would be too. But the script is by two first-timers and the directors biggest credit was the unfunny ""The Ex"" from 2006; although he and one of the screenwriters had the good sense to be born well (their daddy owns the New Republic) you cant exactly put a family tree onscreen. Of course with a cast like this other things manage to make it onscreen. Like Deschanels marvelously odd disconnected gaze or the way Banks character flails about trying to get a juicy quote out of a strictly business source. And Rudds Ned is a fully realized delight right down to his awful Crocs. But dude wheres the movie? Ratings note The film contains substance abuse sexual situations nudity and strong language. Our Idiot Brother (R) Weinstein (90 min.) Directed by Jesse Peretz. With Paul Rudd Elizabeth Banks Zooey Deschanel Emily Mortimer. Now playing in New Jersey.

Photo (c)Weinstein Company The brothers dim in this amusing movie starring Paul Rudd. Behold ""Our Idiot Brother"" Ned (Paul Rudd). Mild as milk loyal as a Labrador soft as hummus he is so gullible that even his friends in the crunchy Catskills think hes a hopeless boob. Especially when a uniformed police officer begs him for some weed while hes selling organic vegetables -- and he gives him some. Neds problem is not that hes an idiot but that hes too trusting. We see him sitting on a subway train with a wad of cash. ""Hold this"" he says to the stranger sitting next to him as he deals with a beverage spill. But the guy sitting next to him is so surprised that he gives the money back when asked. Which is exactly what would actually happen in New York City or so Id like to think. Such cute moments are the heart and soul of this tepid but lovable comedy in which Ned after a prison stretch for the drug sale is forced to rely on the kindness of his mother and three sisters. Each gets exasperated and passes him along to the next one. With Liz (Emily Mortimer) a married earth mama whose kids are called Echo and River Ned accidentally unleashes the sons inner Kung Fu Panda in a house thats so anti-violence (and humorless) that no ones ever heard of the Pink Panther movies. Also Ned accidentally discovers Lizs snooty documentary filmmaker husband Dylan (Steve Coogan) is having an affair. Similar mishaps await when Ned tries sponging off Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) a Vanity Fair journalist and Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) a bisexual would-be standup comic and artists model. In all cases Neds serene clarity and openness cause awkward moments of truth for people who would rather be deceived. ""Our Idiot Brother"" takes delicate swats at some low-hanging fruit. Neds ex-girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn) is one of those unbearable crusties who farms her own produce professes pacifism and says when one of his sisters threatens to punch her ""Im not gonna receive that with anything but love."" A self-help/mind control cult bills itself as offering a ""sustainable upgrade"" which is a fairly perfect combination buzzword for 2011. The filmmakers have looked carefully around them and declared the world to be droll. This is not a bad strategy for dealing with existence and the film goes far on its good nature though it is never more than gently funny. Any movie that asks us to sympathize with a beautiful journalist because she may not get sufficiently juicy quotes for her magazine is aimed only at a certain audience. ""Our Idiot Brother"" which is directed by Jesse Peretz (son of the longtime owner of the New Republic) and co-written by his sister Evgenia (who works for Vanity Fair) suffers slightly from the myopia of the urban creative mafia. Such is the Peretz-eye view of reality that when Ned goes to prison -- twice -- it is merely a relaxing lark whereas Mirandas meeting with a demanding fact checker is (meant to be) nerve-jangling. Characters flit through coffee bars and ice cream shops laze on trampolines attend cocktail parties sketch each other in spacious lofts. The Neds of this world are disappointments because theyd rather play around with biodynamic farming than take their rightful places as princes of the media-cultural complex but outsiders may chafe at the way birthright privileges are taken for granted. Money is so distant a concern that Miranda hands Ned 300 as though its a Tic Tac. So this bourgeois-bohemian movie is in a way as serene in its obliviousness to the exterior world as its man-child subject. Its not essential but it is endearing.

Starring Paul Rudd Elizabeth Banks Zooey Deschanel Emily Mortimer Director Jesse Peretz Running time 135 Release Opened Aug 26 2011  Editorial Review Hes not heavy but his sisters areBy Ann HornadayFriday Aug 26 2011""Our Idiot Brother"" turns out to be mistitled. It should be called ""The Brother We Treat Like an Idiot"" and that goes as much for the filmmakers as the dysfunctional family at the core of this easygoing misfire. Paul Rudd plays Ned Rochlin a perpetually blissed-out biodynamic farmer who in the films first scene sells pot to a police officer. When he gets out of jail he embarks on a serial-crash with his three sisters upending their lives with his anarchic honesty and unbridled naivete. Peeking out from a curtain of shaggy hair and a beard Rudd invests Ned with every ounce of the effusive natural warmth that has become his trademark. And like so many movies in his career he makes ""Our Idiot Brother"" much more tolerable than it deserves to be. Screenwriters Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgall play up Neds innocence by making his sisters thoroughly unappealing Emily Mortimer plays a dowdy sad-sack hausfrau married to a pompous documentarian (played with withering contempt by Steve Coogan); Elizabeth Banks flails in a misguided brunet pageboy as a ruthless Vanity Fair reporter; and Zooey Deschanel lends spaced-out self-absorption to a lesbian tempted by a similarly navel-gazing male artist. Director Jesse Peretz happens to be the screenwriters brother but surely hes no idiot. Still one wonders whose idea it was that Deschanels partner - played by Rashida Jones - would take her sartorial style points from Urkel. Or whether the scene-stealing Kathryn Hahn as Neds witchy hippie ex-girlfriend had to be such a witch. ""Our Idiot Brother"" holds Ned up as a paragon of decency and trust to the point where in one scene he cheerfully asks a guy on the subway to hold a wad of cash - and the man does gobsmacked. As Ned himself says if you give people the benefit of the doubt theyll live up to it. But the filmmakers are so intent on demonizing everyone else in Neds life that it suggests they dont believe their own tag line. There are times when ""Our Idiot Brother"" possesses a loping genial sweetness. But it lacks conviction and it doesnt hold a beeswax candle to such similarly themed films as ""You Can Count on Me"" and ""Mommas Man."" Rudd has created a genuinely engaging character in the Candide-like Ned but ""Our Idiot Brother"" gives him very little garden to cultivate.Contains sexual content including nudity and profanity throughout.

Joe Neumaier Friday August 26 2011 400 AM Title Our Idiot Brother With Paul Rudd Elizabeth Banks Zooey Deschanel. A dopey dude blunders into the lives of his sisters.  Director Jesse Peretz (135). R Nudity sexuality language. At area theaters.The problems with ""Our Idiot Brother"" are a lot like the ones with its main character an organic farmer and mini-Lebowski named Ned Rockland Despite a pleasantly laid-back demeanor you wish it would just get focused.Ned is played by Paul Rudd which makes both the man and the movie easier to deal with.Shagginess is a badge of honor for Ned though its as unforced as his guileless smile when he sells a uniformed cop some pot. Thats what lands Ned in an upstate New York jail for a few months.When he gets out he finds a major bummer waiting His girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn perfect) is shacking up with another crunchy dude leaving poor Ned with nowhere to go.She has even co-opted his dog Willie Nelson. So Ned heads to New York City to mooch off his three sisters.Theyre as easy to label as a pint of Ben amp; Jerrys Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is City Power Girl a magazine writer whose big story Ned thrusts himself into.Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is Lesbian Hipster Crunch snuggling with her girlfriend (Rashida Jones) while flirting with a guy doing her nude portrait. And Liz (Emily Mortimer) is Sloping Brooklyn Mommy blind to the philandering of her husband Dylan (funny Steve Coogan) but annoyed that her young son is imitating Ned.Neds supposed to be an innocent but in Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgalls script he easily slips into a kind-of brain-damaged state when hes not ""fixing"" his familys lives.His naivete is an affectation though it does provide the movies funniest moment in which Ned ignores a naked Dylan so he can get a dab of hand sanitizer.When director Jesse Peretz lets some of his actors coast things can get sparky One scene with Rudd Banks and Adam Scott as Mirandas acerbic neighbor has the rhythms of real life.But too often there are would-be ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" moments - like when the girls throw accusations and recriminations at each other - or plot-moving bits of business like Neds friendship with the celebrity Miranda needs to interview.That all makes ""Our Idiot Brother"" feel forced something the genial Rudd is metabolically opposed to. Whether in farces like ""Dinner for Schmucks"" or his Will Ferrell comedies or in Judd Apatows let-it-hang bromances he never wears out his welcome.Rudd even sells Neds dude-isms including ""Like wow just I mean. You know? Wow."" When he says that he can have about four separate meanings. ""Our Idiot Brother"" though harshes our mellow by getting all fuzzy-paper-cutter sit-com-y. Which like aint cool man.Magic moment Just out-of-jail Ned and another hippie face off over Neds girlfriend - and both seem so mellow they could fall asleep.

The Weinstein Company By John Anderson August 26 2011 ""Our Idiot Brother"" about a preternaturally guileless hippie named Ned and his three weird sisters has a title designed to tickle Idiot brother? Some of us have one. Some of us are one. Its a title that seems to tell you everything you need to know about the film--like say ""Snakes on a Plane."" Just one more entry in the seemingly inexhaustible parade of loser comedies. Right? Not quite. View a scene from ""Our Idiot Brother"" starring Paul Rudd. Courtesy Weinstein Company. The muttonhead of the title is portrayed by the eminently likable Paul Rudd who has brought an ironic self-awareness to many slacker comedies a category that would include ""Our Idiot Brother""--if ""Our Idiot Brother"" werent also an allegorical social critique inspired by Fyodor Dostoevsky and his collaborator Jesus Christ. Directed by Jesse Peretz--and co-written by his sister Vanity Fair contributor Evgenia Peretz and her husband David Schisgall--the film finds comedy in contemporary mores; satire in hypocrisy; and inspiration in Dostoevskys ""The Idiot."" In that novel the hero Prince Myshkin possessed such goodness he was judged insane and sent to a sanitarium. Upon emerging his life is dominated by three sisters. Eventually he goes back to the madhouse. Likewise Ned sort of Its his innate decency that prompts him to give a bag of pot to a uniformed police officer; the cop whos been crying the blues to get the pot then insists on paying so he can properly arrest Ned for trafficking. Off Ned goes to the hoosegow where he becomes a popular prisoner and gets released early then meanders back to the organic farm he shared with his girlfriend the loathsome Janet (a great Kathryn Hahn) on the assumption that life as he knew it will resume. No way Janet has taken up with another airhead Billy (T.J. Miller) and unceremoniously evicts Ned from the farm. She wont even give him custody of Willie Nelson his very mellow golden retriever. Paroled and homeless Ned is remanded to that place where when you have to go there they have to take you in Moms. With his long hair beard blissful mien and empathetic nature Ned is the embodiment of those qualities we idealize in theory and often recoil from in the flesh pure goodness; an utterly frank nature; a propensity for saying the wrong (aka truthful) thing at the wrong time. While everyone in his dubious family extended and otherwise is painfully aware of Neds supposed shortcomings he is blithely oblivious to theirs. Which takes some doing Selfish and self-absorbed theyre state-of-the-art hipsters who provide themselves all manner of moral alibis through holier-than-thou lifestyle options. One sister Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is in a committed relationship with lawyer Cindy (Rashida Jones) although she beds down with just about anyone. Another Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) a writer for a monthly magazine is happy to exploit Neds people skills to get a juicy story out of a high-profile subject--and to involve Ned in a cover-up when her ethics are questioned. Sister Liz (Emily Mortimer) and her husband Dylan (Steve Coogan) are helicopter parents. Oppressive. Superior. Hovering. When Ned offers their son a snack he is told in no uncertain terms that the young lad has already had his weekly cupcake. When Ned shows his nephew a movie on his laptop he is chastised by Dad. (""This country is obsessed with screens"") Nevermind that Dylan is a documentary filmmaker. Or that hes sleeping with his next subject a Russian ballerina. Ned meanwhile bounces like a beachball over the speed bumps of life always forgiving except of himself When hes hit on at a party by a couple interested in a threesome Ned tries to go along but ultimately cant--and then apologizes profusely for his inability to shortcircuit his own sexual orientation. Its a very touching scene no pun intended and not exactly apolitical. ""My Idiot Brother"" might have made Ned more of a symbol and less of a person. Where the filmmakers and Mr. Rudd go right is making him such a round and sympathetic figure rather than the desperate pathetic and/or slapstick character he might have been in different hands. ""Our Idiot Brother""--not ""My"" or ""Your"" or ""Their"" idiot brother--is goofily funny and silly and in many ways follows the currents of contemporary comedy into the gulf stream of inanity. And yet Ned turns out to be a strangely moving figure a comic foil worthy of affection perhaps even respect. ENLARGE Sam Riley and Andrea Riseborough in Brighton Rock. IFC Brighton Rock Graham Greenes conflicted Catholicism was the root of his novels spiritual gravitas--""The Power and the Glory"" (1940) being an obvious example. Less well-known is Greenes 1938 ""Brighton Rock"" a pulp-fictional tale of low-lifes scuttling about the English beach resort which has now been given a glorious gloss by director Rowan (son of Roland) Joffe. Expanded visually beyond anything resembling the comparatively claustrophobic 1947 film (which starred a wonderfully scrofulous Richard Attenborough) and imbued with a feverish morality that would have gratified Mr. Greene himself the film is almost distractingly beautiful to look at something that accentuates the tension between the films conflicting quantities i.e. the glories of the physical world and the corrupted humanity it hosts. In keeping with the current media mania for the early 1960s ""Brighton Rock"" has been updated to 1964 and the time of the Mods-Rockers riots. Its was an era when men were men and women were not and a naive waitress like Rose (Andrea Riseborough) could be swept off her feet by the likes of Pinkie Brown (Sam Riley) a not-quite-up-and-coming gangster who has killed a fellow hood and needs Rose as his alibi. As Pinkie wearing a nasty razor slash across his cheek tries to avoid being rubbed out Rose falls stupidly in love with him causing her devoted employer Ida (Helen Mirren) to try and rescue her from his clutches. In the midst of all the noirish goings-on the couples shared Catholicism provides a tortured moral backdrop to their relationship and to Pinkies criminality. His religion doesnt seem to affect his outlook on murder but it certainly governs his relationship to sex and marriage What should have produced cognitive dissonance seems to make sense to our ill-fated pair even as they swirl around the drain to perdition. Mr. Joffe keeps things moving and cinematographer John Mathieson (""Gladiator"" ""Robin Hood"") shooting in a widescreen format makes rapturous use of the sky and sea around Brighton where often below the lower edge of the frame ugly matters are afoot. View a scene from ""Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark"" Courtesy FilmDistrict. Dont Be Afraid of the Dark The original 1973 telefilm frightened a 10-year-old Mexican named Guillermo del Toro into becoming the pre-eminent fantasist of world cinema. So the remake of ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark""--directed by Troy Nixey produced by Mr. Del Toro and starring Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce--would seem to promise a few revelations either regarding the state of cinema or the state of Mr. del Toro. What it has to say mostly regards the importance of casting. Mr. Nixey a comic-book artist short-film maker and del Toro protege forsakes the ha-ha-horror approach to movie dread in favor of an old-fashioned creepfest replete with creatures shadows and imperiled children--in his case Sally (Bailee Madison) who has come to live with her father Alex (Mr. Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Ms. Holmes) in a decaying hulk of a house infested with scurrying ratlike demons. The houses original owner who comes and very abruptly goes in the films gruesome opening flashback (the foyer of the story one might say) was a famous designer a la William Morris and if Alex and Kim can restore the house to its Arts and Craft origins they can get on the cover of Architectural Digest. Daughter be damned. ENLARGE Katie Holmes in Dont Be Afraid of the Dark. Miramax And the daughter dilemma is really the heart of the matter. Sally is an unhappy child shuttled from one parent to another; she feels unwelcome with either parent; she wants to go home without knowing where that is. Sallys initial reaction to the voices and creatures inhabiting the sealed-off rooms of the house is wonder not fear. The little fiends play to her weakness ""We want to be your friend"" they coo coaxing her to unseal the ancient ash pit where theyve been captive for a century. Between the music which evokes Bernard Herrmann and the flashing-camera conceit which suggests ""Rear Window"" Mr. Nixey is doing an Alfred Hitchcock homage within a movie lacking anything as subversive or skilled as Hitchcock. Its never explained but Sally carries around a 1970s-era Polaroid replete with bygone flashcubes with which she captures the creatures; a laptop yes would have been cumbersome. The special effects as per any del Toro project are convincing. The motivations less so. During one screening in Manhattan the film reached the point where young Sally has been traumatized for about the fourth time and Alex moans ""I have no idea what do."" ""I do"" someone piped up and the rest of the room erupted in laughs. When an audience is primed to scoff the movie has problems. Those problems include the performance of both Ms. Holmes who never seems to get much traction and young Ms. Madison who is everywhere and for very little reason. Cute sure; convincing no. Circumstance Among those matters generally filed under ""Mutually Exclusive"" are ""sex"" and ""Iranian cinema"" but theres genuine heat emanating from ""Circumstance"" director Maryam Keshavarzs stylish cry of outrage against Irans criminalization of all things youthful music dancing romance--the gateway drugs of intellectual adulthood. There will be complaints that ""Circumstance"" launches its attack on Tehran from a safe distance both culturally and geographically--the New York University-educated Ms. Keshavarz filmed clandestinely in Beirut--but this is not a documentary nor a solely political film Although the circumstances of the story involve theocratic oppression and rampant villainy this is a movie about longing desire desperation and the abandonment of principle--quite a collection of themes all universal. Its also supremely cinematic In her portrayal of the three principals--the privileged Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) the orphaned beauty Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) and Atafehs crackhead-cum-Islamo-fascist brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai)--Ms. Keshavarz uses the mechanics of moviemaking to create interior dialogues and expose the lie of religious fundamentalism. Although there is little that would be deemed explicit by Western standards there is one scene involving nudity and lesbian sex; one assumes it is the fantasy of one of the movies girls-gone-wild until Mehran wakes up and you realize that one persons pleasantly erotic sex dream would likely be a religious zealots screaming nightmare. ""If you could be anywhere in the world"" a voice asks at the beginning of the film ""where would you be?"" Not in present-day Tehran. But a screening of ""Circumstance"" wouldnt be out of the question. --John Anderson contributes film reviews and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Clueless (1995) Perky fashionista Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) thinks her stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) is something of an idiot in writer-director Amy Heckerlings Jane Austen-inspired masterpiece of teenage manners. Cher eventually comes around of course and so have audiences ""Clueless"" a major career move for Mr. Rudd has long established itself as one of the more beloved films of the 1990s and one that captures a cultural moment as precisely and hilariously as any American comedy. It also co-stars Dan Hedaya as Chers father who warns her date ""I got a .45 and a shovel and I doubt anybody would miss you."" Control (2007) Sam Rileys breakout performance was as the suicidal Ian Curtis the Rimbaud of postpunk and the guiding spirit of the revered rock band Joy Division. The debut feature of Dutch music-videogapher Anton Corbijn ""Control"" chronicles Curtis relationship with his wife Deborah (Samantha Morton) the creation of Joy Division and his suicide in 1980 at age 23. With the exception of the number that accompanies the closing credits (""Atmosphere"") all Joy Division songs in the film are performed by the actors. Mr. Corbijn used his own EUR4.5 million (6.5 million) to finance the film--and he made his money back. Pans Labyrinth (2006) One of the great films of the past decade this Fascist-era fantasy is Guillermo del Toro at his best Otherworldy hallucinatory but always deeply human. Set five years after the Spanish Civil War ""Pan"" pits a deliriously lovely little girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) against her new stepfather Col.

Hes more of a cockeyed optimist.By Nicole Rivelli The Weinstein Co.The films driving force Paul Rudd stars as Ned who stays with each of his three sisters after a stint in jail for selling marijuana.EnlargeCloseBy Nicole Rivelli The Weinstein Co.The films driving force Paul Rudd stars as Ned who stays with each of his three sisters after a stint in jail for selling marijuana.Sponsored LinksSure hes a bit slovenly with his bushy hair and unkempt beard. He doesnt seem to own a pair of pants. But in his daily uniform of dorky tank tops shorts and Crocs hes just a sweet openhearted guy whose honesty keeps getting him in trouble. In contemporary society that can make him seem like an idiot.Paul Rudd is charming as Ned the laid-back title character. Hes surrounded by women he seems to constantly annoy and disappoint. At the top of the list are his neurotic sisters Liz (Emily Mortimer) Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) and Miranda (Elizabeth Banks). His mother (Shirley Knight) treats him like a child and his hippie ex-girlfriend Janet (Kathryn Hahn) pushes him around and refuses to part with their golden retriever Willie Nelson even though everyone sees Ned loves the dog more than life itself.STORY Paul Rudd is just one grateful geeky guyVIDEO Oh BrotherNed is that rare human who is unfailingly upbeat and sees the good in everyone. He loves his family simply and without reservation. They love him too but cant help but be exasperated when his guileless honesty interferes with their lives.Ned is no saint. He indulges in the occasional joint. And weed is what kicks off his spate of bad luck. While at a farmers market peddling organic vegetables he sells marijuana to a uniformed police officer. His punishment is four months in prison.About the movieOur Idiot Brother   out of fourStars Paul Rudd Elizabeth Banks Zooey Deschanel Emily Mortimer Steve Coogan Rashida Jones Shirley Knight Adam Scott Hugh Dancy Director Jesse PeretzDistributor The Weinstein Company Rating R for sexual content including nudity and language throughout Running time 1 hour 30 minutes Opens Friday nationwide""This is what happens when you dont use your head"" one of his sisters tells him. But Ned is all heart and very little head.Once hes out on parole each of his sisters takes a turn housing Ned. His existence may be aimless but his prickly sisters lives are not as rosy as they seem. As various strands unravel Ned emerges as a sweetly trusting fellow who just might end up on top after all. Rudd perfectly captures the perennially cheerful man-child. The laughs are consistent and occasionally outlandish but more often they arise out of recognizable family situations. The movie directed by Jesse Peretz and written by his sister Evgenia Peretz and her husband David Schisgall is more playful than hilarious and it avoids the mean-spiritedness that a movie about a clueless neer-do-well could indulge in.Though the ensemble cast is uniformly strong this is Rudds film. His inherent likability and genial manner are ideal for the character. He plays laid-back especially well. (His aging surfer dude in Forgetting Sarah Marshall was a variation on Ned.) Watching Rudd bring dimension to what could have been a clownish caricature is the best reason to see this good-natured family comedy. Our Idiot Brother is as irresistible and easy to love as a golden retriever. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Starring Paul Rudd Emily Mortimer Elizabeth Banks and Zooey Deschanel. Directed by Jesse Peretz. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Comedy has gotten better - more harsh and honest less safe and formulaic - in recent years and so we get ""Our Idiot Brother"" which easily could have been mildly funny and phony but instead is really funny and true to life. Its directed by Jesse Peretz whose brash style hasnt changed much since he made a low-budget comedy ""The Chateau"" 10 years ago. But now audiences and movies have caught up with the kind of thing Peretz does and so he gets to do it on a bigger scale. Every character in ""Our Idiot Brother"" is a singular creation vivid and with a clear point of view especially the title character Ned (Paul Rudd) a sweet trusting guy who is seriously slow on the uptake. In the opening scene he sells marijuana to a policeman - not an undercover cop but a uniformed officer. Ned does this partly because hes witless but also because the cop claims to be having a bad week and Ned wants to help. Hes openhearted lovable and completely hopeless. Related Stories Review Our Idiot Brother What do you do with a guy like this? Everyone will recognize Ned Pushing 40 never had a real job not a thought about the future surfing from one couch to another and psychologically frozen at about 20 years old - and yet appealing for all those reasons. If you were 8 this would be your favorite uncle ever. Its a curious combination to be so good at life and so ill-equipped for living in the world. Ned gets out of prison around the time the opening credits end and we follow him as he tries to restart his life while staying with each of his sisters. Emily Mortimer plays the eldest a harried wife and mother who has let herself go. Elizabeth Banks is the middle sister a perfectly coiffed control freak and burgeoning journalist. And Zooey Deschanel is the youngest a randomly promiscuous stand-up comedian going through a lesbian phase. The comedy derives from watching Ned who never has anything less than the best of intentions screw up the lives of each of his sisters. Much of this is hilarious benefiting enormously from the care taken by Peretz his cast and his screenwriters (David Schisgall and Evgenia Peretz) to ground in specifics of the sisters needs and personalities. I have to say though as a journalist it hurts to watch him torpedo a big story his sister is working on. Perhaps you have to work in media to understand just how unforgivable that would be - it might take years not days to get over it. Rudd is also nicely contrasted with British comic Steve Coogan (""The Trip"") as the brother-in-law who is everything Ned isnt - smart competent closed off deceptive and fundamentally miserable. ""Our Idiot Brother"" floats along nicely throwing Ned as a wrench into various situations and letting us watch as he screws up the works. Thats about all ""Our Idiot Brother"" has to offer - thats enough - though you may notice the plot machinery kicking into gear about three-quarters of the way in so as to prepare things for a landing. These are touches of awkwardness but easy enough to ignore. Actually ""Our Idiot Brother"" has one more thing to offer and thats the spectacle of people talking and sounding like people in daily life. Its odd In real life Id probably find the relentless vulgarity of the youngest sister annoying or at least ridiculous. But hearing Deschanel curse her head off every other line is amusing and even satisfying in that it means the movie has roped in another aspect of modern behavior. The truer it is the funnier it is.

Handcuffs and a jail sentence quickly follow.When we see Rudds hippie-dippy doofus strolling out of the prison hes got that same goofy grin as he affectionately says goodbye to inmates and guards alike. Welcome to the world of Ned an eternally sunny realm where everyone is greeted as an old friend and everything will always work out fine even when it doesnt.Our Idiot Brother is an easygoing comedy that mostly succeeds with its laid-back ethos only occasionally curdling into laziness. In this way the movie -- from director Jesse Peretz -- aptly mirrors its subject. For Ned too there is a fine line between feeling fine and acting like a loser-idiot. His kindred-spirit mother (Shirley Knight) summarizes his life resume with ""Youve never had a real job there was that jail business and you havent given me any grandchildren.""When Ned discovers that hes been cast out of his organic-farm Eden he drifts into the lives of his three sisters the ambition-overdrive journalist Miranda (Elizabeth Banks); the shut-down stay-at-home mom Liz (Emily Mortimer); and the self-sabotaging lesbian Natalie (Zooey Deschanel). Assembling this triumvirate of comic actresses may be this films greatest achievement. The few scenes in which they are allowed to let loose and interact are almost enough to make you wish the movie was titled The Idiot Brothers Three Sisters.But Paul Rudd being Paul Rudd its impossible to wish away Ned or really want to. With his Woodstock-refugee wardrobe and Jesus hair and beard Rudd plays Ned as equal parts fool child and Zen master. Ned drifts through the movie going whichever way one of his sisters scolds or implores him. He never meets a stranger and he never tells a lie. If this were an ordinary Hollywood comedy that would result in all kinds of frantic forcefully ""hilarious"" consequences. But Peretz working with first-time screenwriters Evgenia Peretz (his sister) and David Schisgall goes for an alternative-comedy experience thats more interested in a slow burn of giggles than flashy explosion of guffaws.For all its abundant slacker charms Our Idiot Brother is full of smartly observed moments and detailed performances. Its an all-star cast of deftly comic actors. Just try picking between T.J. Millers sublimely goofy Billy and Stephen Coogans arrogantly slimy Dylan as best-in-show. It cant be done; theyre both perfect. This is a film of small sharp moments Ned and cool-guy Jeremy (Adam Scott) girl-watching in a coffee shop with Jeremy offering short-story-worthy vignettes of everyone they see; Ned all caught up in a having-a-great-conversation rush asking a beautiful heiress out on a date and she genuinely sweetly responding ""No not really but thanks for asking.""The great ensemble of actors and the unsinkable charm of the characters make it easy to forgive the films few formulaic lapses.Our Idiot BrotherB Starring Paul Rudd Elizabeth Banks Zooey Deschanel Emily Mortimer T.J.

Who doesnt like Paul Rudd? The Rudd appeal is what makes the otherwise indigestible Our Idiot Brother go down easy. Rudd plays Ned Rochlin a slacking stoner in cargo shots ratty Ts and ugly-ass Crocs. Neds not smart. He sells weed to a cop in uniform. But hes not dumb either. Ned speaks the truth. Not in the holy fool ""I like to watch"" manner of Peter Sellers in the immortal Being There - we could only wish - but like a dude whos basically good at heart. Such behavior doesnt play in New York where Ned has just been dumped by his girlfriend (a fun feisty Kathryn Hahn) an organic farmer who has stolen the only thing Ned truly loves. That would be Willie Nelson. Not the country singer but Neds dog. Cue the cutes. Or dont because director Jesse Peretz - yes the former Lemonheads bassist - deserves credit for not going the cloying route.

Enter Neds three sisters. Ned goes to live with each of them in boring lockstep turn. Theres not a sweetie in the bunch. Liz (Emily Mortimer) is a homebody oblivious to her cheating filmmaker husband (Steve Coogan in full slime). Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is a VF writer whod lie cheat and steal for a scoop. And Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is an oversexed bisexual with a cruel streak. The delicious Deschanel Banks and Mortimer dont deserve the cardboard bitchery the script reduces them to. And we Rudd fans dont deserve to see our boy reduced at films end to a hippy prophet teaching moral lessons to the chic and superficial. Our Idiot Brother comes off as a blueprint for a smart script no one really made. Now thats what I call dumb.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Not good but inoffensive ""Our Idiot Brother"" exists in a kind of Dead Zone of entertainment. Its mediocre in a passive energy-sapping way midway between humdrum and ho-hum. Paul Rudd likable in Judd Apatow films but insipid here stars as Ned an affable pothead. We meet him staffing a vegetable stand at a small-town farmers market and we quickly see that Ned is sort of a vegetable himself wide-eyed but unseeing. The character is saddled with enough innocence to make a Clydesdale buckle. Hes established as a sweet goodhearted simpleton by selling pot to a uniformed police officer. When the poor sap emerges from jail on probation his abrasive hippie farmer girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn) sends him packing having found a new stoner to boss around during Neds time behind bars. Too bad; Hahns cameo as a dreadlocked tie-dyed pacifist tyrant is sublime. The brief wrangles between this despotic Earth mother and Ned the passive drooping flower child are the movies most idiosyncratically funny moments. Ned takes his loving goofy kooky act to New York City where he hopes to crash with his sisters Liz Miranda and Natalie (Emily Mortimer Elizabeth Banks and Zooey Deschanel) who regard him as a troublesome mascot. His arrival triggers trivial traumas and flaccid comedy skits. Each actress plays a specific New York type; the problem is that they remain stereotypes never coming into focus as authentic individuals. Mortimer is a striving upscale Brooklyn mom married to an insufferable documentary filmmaker (Steve Coogan displaying none of his usual I-dare-you-to-hate-me charm). Banks is a Vanity Fair writer fretting over her first big assignment a profile of a scandal-tainted English princess. Deschanel is a no-talent standup comedian with promiscuity issues dating a lawyer named Cindy (Rashida Jones) but undecided about which side of the bisexual spectrum she really belongs on. Like a holy fool in cargo shorts and flip-flops hapless Ned bumbles through each womans life just long enough to help her achieve a breakthrough. Liz realizes that shes facing bigger issues than getting her kids into exclusive private schools. Miranda reorders her work and life priorities. Liz gets her act together. Weinstein Co. Star Tribune Paul Rudd in ""Our Idiot Brother."" This is not a story but a jumble of vignettes. The script tries to link the episodes like so many points in a connect-the-dots drawing. But no picture appears. The points provide no more design than random specks on a blank wall. The dialogue is aimless chitchat sometimes amusing but directionless. The sequences intended to be heartwarming are merely tepid. The story depends on our concern for guileless Ned and our affection for Rudd. I felt little in either category. Ned meets every setback with a shrug. This flavorless film deserves the same. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Our Idiot Brother review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review Our Idiot BrotherPaul Rudds delightful fool carries the amiable underachieving comedy.August 26 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Paul Rudd and Elizabeth Banks in ""Our Idiot Brother."" (Nicole Rivelli / The Weinstein...)You can thank Paul Rudd for the natural high that keeps ""Our Idiot Brother"" floating along so amusingly. This amiable if underachieving comedy is about just how much the truth hurts. First cut is the idiot brother a that would be Rudds organic-farming dope-smoking not-a-care-in-the-world Ned. Soon nursing bruises are his three overachieving sisters an eclectic bunch nicely wound into a frenzy by Elizabeth Banks Emily Mortimer and Zooey Deschanel. Things get underway at a rural farmers market with a classic no-good-deed-goes-unpunished moment. Ned shares his pot stash with a cop a despite the uniform (and funny even though the scene anchors those hard-to-miss trailers). When Ned emerges from the jail time that minor infraction bought his losing streak continues. The girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn) wont take him back and worse shes intent on keeping the dog. But really thats just the windup. All of Neds compassion unfiltered honesty and genuine love of mankind is about to be unleashed on his family. Its a case of boundless goodness wrecking havoc though one could argue its sometimes too much of a good thing. Off-screen the film is just as much a family affair. Directing is Jesse Peretz (2006s ""The Ex"" with Jason Bateman) whose comedies tend to fall on the loosey-goosey side. His sister Evgenia Peretz a contributing editor for Vanity Fair and David Schisgall her documentary filmmaker husband co-wrote a screenplay filled with riffs on Vanity Fair and documentary filmmaking. They do their best work however with whimsy or at least thats what Id call the decision to tie a crucial plot point to a very huggable golden retriever named Willie Nelson whose wagging tail is usually accompanied by clever cuts of the real Willie Nelsons songs. The movie is defined by various very recognizable types of people. Neds sisters are basically good folks whove been sidetracked by ambition and the high expectations of their individual New York City niches a the Brooklyn brownstone mommy-track the West Villages stylish smart set and the Bushwick bohemians. Banks is Miranda a writer for Vanity Fair desperate to break out of the cosmetics/beauty trenches to do some serious journalism for the magazine. Mortimers Liz is making a career out of minting her children to PC perfection while her marriage to a pretentious documentary filmmaker (Steve Coogan) is fraying. Deschanel is Natalie a free spirit increasingly tethered to reality by her relationship with hipster/attorney Cindy (Rashida Jones). For the most part the actresses manage to represent clichA(c)s without becoming ones. Ned looking for all the world like a 60s hippie throwback outfitted with a bad wig is there to keep easing things on down the road. Though there is a certain predictability there is fun to be had at other peoples expense primarily as Ned unwittingly exposes the naked truth. And the truth is that humans are most often tripped up by their own foibles. The film has enough of a subversive sensibility that it was popular with the Sundance Film Festival crowd. The ending has been changed since then to tidy things up a bit (making it neither better nor worse). But Peretzs filmmaking style stays the course as languid as the guys who smoke dope on-screen. The comedy isnt always as crisp as it should be but Peretz has the perfect partner in crime in Rudd. The actor has an uncanny ability to create characters that feel completely devoid of avarice angst or anything unseemly. There is nary a worry line on that brow and I dont think its Botox. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESHoliday-season movie releasesNovember 1 2013Movie review Gregory Crewdson Brief Encounters of art...March 8 2013Review A one-dimensional portrait in Blinky amp; MeSeptember 7 2012TV review Citizen U.S.A.

Nicole Rivelli/The Weinstein Company hide caption toggle caption Nicole Rivelli/The Weinstein Company Our Idiot Brother Director Jesse Peretz Genre Comedy Running Time 95 minutes Rated R for sexual content including nudity and for language throughout With Paul Rudd Elizabeth Banks Zooey Deschanel Emily Mortimer Hugh Dancy Busted Busted Credit The Weinstein Company Tourettes Tourettes Credit The Weinstein Company Youre Wearing Food Youre Wearing Food Credit The Weinstein Company A rambling indie comedy about a shambling hippie man-child Our Idiot Brother sets loose a sweetly innocent farmer (Paul Rudd) amongst uptight urban siblings (Elizabeth Banks Zooey Deschanel and Emily Mortimer) and ... well thats about it really. Theres no particular high-concept rationale or low-rent aesthetic to the comedy that ensues. There are laughs -- quite a few in fact -- though somehow not in the sort of sequences that build on one another to achieve outright hilarity. The rhythms are gentle the smiles plentiful the chuckles frequent with the overall effect about as pleasantly innocuous as the films hero. Rudd plays Ned an adorably shaggy organic farmer so innately trusting and generous that in the films opening scene he offers a therapeutic bag of weed to a uniformed policeman who claims to be having a bad week. Released from jail a bit later and evicted by a moody girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn) who decides to keep his dog Ned finds himself with nowhere to go. So he drifts from one sisters home to the next theoretically looking for work but mostly just couch-surfing and annoying his hosts by blurting out privileged information. Its information that he comes by honestly being so open and guileless that folks just naturally confide in him. Im not sure this would actually happen in real life; I suspect most people would become more guarded not less in the presence of someone as dorkily clueless as Ned. But the screenplay (by Evgenia Peretz and her husband David Schisgall) sets up the notion persuasively enough and benefits mightily from having Rudd on hand to sell it. ""I like to think if you put your trust out there"" Ned explains a little too baldly in one scene ""people will rise to the occasion."" Alas this dude has no filter Once he knows something -- and for plot purposes he ends up knowing everything -- its apt to come bubbling up at the least opportune moment to the one person who shouldnt hear it. So one sister (Mortimer) learns abruptly about her hubbys affair while another (Deschanel) has an infidelity revealed to a lesbian partner and a third (Banks) has both a friendship and a job upended. That each of these three is troubled in her own right allows the screenwriters and director Jesse Peretz (Evgenias brother and former Lemonheads bassist) to turn Our Idiot Brother into an overly neat fable about sweetness battling cynicism to a draw. Theres obviously a Gump-ian aspect to this notion of a guileless soul triumphing through the sheer force of good intentions but happily its muted. The calorie count is lower than in that box-of-chocolates confection innocences social impact less all-encompassing. Forrest kept having an inadvertent influence on world-shaking events; Neds a latter-day Candide seeing a best-of-all-possible-worlds where those around him see a more complicated landscape but not having any broader effect. He just ambles into family crises and makes them worse before making them better. i Left to right Liz (Emily Mortimer) Miranda (Banks) and Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) Neds put-upon sisters are each dealing with relationship crises of their own -- made worse but then strangely helped by Neds arrival. Nicole Rivelli/The Weinstein Company hide caption toggle caption Nicole Rivelli/The Weinstein Company Left to right Liz (Emily Mortimer) Miranda (Banks) and Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) Neds put-upon sisters are each dealing with relationship crises of their own -- made worse but then strangely helped by Neds arrival. Nicole Rivelli/The Weinstein Company To sustain the laid-back-Ned/shrill-sisters conflict across 90 minutes the films women have mostly been conceived as grotesquely high-maintenance (Shirley Knight being a notable exception as the clans tippling mom) an approach that would feel borderline misogynistic if the men fared any better. But with Steve Coogans cartoonish sleazebag of a brother-in-law leading a parade of weirdoes (Hugh Dancy as a new-age-cult-pushing artist) and doofuses (T.J. Miller as a farmer dim enough to make Ned seem an over-achiever) Our Idiot Brother cant really be said to pursue a gender-based agenda or any agenda at all really as it drifts toward a too-pat conclusion. Still it finds laughs along the way most of them centered on Rudd (hes in nearly every frame) but arising from the reactions of secondary characters -- say a New York teens astonishment when Ned (whos been unselfconsciously counting cash in a crowded subway car) hands him a thick wad of bills to hold while he cleans up a spilled drink. Rudds demeanor is so affectless in this sort of moment that the performers around him look genuinely thunderstruck which is not to suggest that the star is ever being less than artful. For proof just watch him riffing through a ""Whos the man?"" ""Youre the man"" ""No youre the man"" pep talk with a butched-up Rashida Jones near the films midpoint. Their exchange -- plainspoken natural unforced -- cant last 30 seconds but it so plausibly combines well-meaning incomprehension with sublime comic timing that it plays like vintage Abbott amp; Costello.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + A new Muppet movie isnt scheduled to arrive until November. But for anyone who cant wait theres ""Our Idiot Brother which actually makes say ""Muppets From Space seem like August Wilson and makes you feel like one of the box-seat grouches on the old ""Muppet Show.You want to like the movie that asks you to believe that Shirley Knight could be the biological mother of Paul Rudd Emily Mortimer Zooey Deschanel and Elizabeth Banks. You want to like the movie that delivers Rudd as a dim peacenik named Ned who wears his hair and beard long and his Crocs bright. He could play the bongos for Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem.You want to laugh when Ned catches his brother-in-law (Steve Coogan) naked with a beautiful woman or when he smashes the hand of his nephew in a door. But then you realize that Ned really is an idiot. Hes pathologically free-spirited and fresh out of prison for selling pot to a cop he exists to exasperate the three sisters who live in and around New York by the popping in and out of their lives.You want to laugh at this except the movie is forcing you to do so. Adultery and dysfunction are cute problems. Deschanels character shares a loft with her girlfriend (Rashida Jones underutilized again and still the best thing here) and a gang of bohemians who dont get up to anything interesting. Though Deschanels compulsion to play another Quirky Performance Artist is satisfied. Banks (shrill careerist) and Mortimer (neurotic wimp) conform to type too. Ned makes their relationships harder than they already appear to be. Hes a gimmick and yet without him the movie is just ""Hanna-Barbera and Her Sisters. Either way its all emotionally counterfeit and that bogusness infects the comedy.Whatever authentic eccentricity the director Jesse Peretz once had in movies like ""First Love Last Rites and ""The Chateau an underrated comedy with Rudd and Romany Malco has curdled into the canned eccentricity thats made Deschanel so predictable in movies. Peretz has figured out how to make a happy commercial contraption with eccentric flavoring. This one was flavored by his sister Evgenia who wrote the script with her husband David Schisgall. You can feel them all straining for a hit so desperately and with such condescension that theyve lost any sense of what their movie is about who this family is how its members relate to each other. All they want is your Facebook ""like.I knew we were in trouble when we learn that Neds dog is named Willie Nelson. What feels like a quarter of the movie is spent trying to pry Willie from the grip of Neds ex-girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn) who kicked Ned off the little biodynamic farm she now shares with a bigger idiot (T.J. Miller). The dog is part of the punch line for the last scene which is so sweet the FDA should rate the movie too.I didnt care for ""Little Miss Sunshine but I believed its starting point. I believed the relationships. That movie might be the most important American comedy of the last 10 years. Even if filmmakers arent consciously trying to replicate it some audiences are hoping they do. The studios are still looking for a way to match that movie or top it and part of the appeal of Peretzs film was also the appeal of ""Little Miss Sunshine good actors in a bad family and on the move. At least once in a van. Of course.The best moment in ""Our Idiot Brother isnt funny at all. Ned finally cracks his life-is-good veneer and barks at his sisters during a family game. Theyve lost the innocence that he clings to and wants to preserve in his nephew. Rudd reminds you that when pushed he can summon great rage that his shticks have levels. In other words he woke me up in that scene. I drifted off again when I remembered the game theyre all playing.

Wide-eyed and scruffy Ned is played with slow-on-the-uptake comic cool by Paul Rudd - its a role in Our Idiot Brother that the actor seems to inhabit happily. Hes like a golden retriever with Crocs (OK and with long messy black hair and a beard) trusting eager to please impossible to embarrass. Slideshow No idiot but an aimless goof Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Our Idiot Brother >> In fact Ned has a golden retriever whom he calls Willie Nelson and whos at the center of a custody battle between Ned and his organic farmer ex-girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn). Getting the pooch back after she dumps him is one of Neds more pressing concerns. Pretty much everything else - where to live how to make money what to do with his life - is up for grabs. Our Idiot Brother directed by Jesse Peretz from a screenplay written by his sister Evgenia Peretz and her partner David Schisgall is a suitably laid-back and goofy affair. And of course theres really nothing idiotic about Rudds Ned at all. He just expects everyone else to be as good-hearted and guileless as he is. ""People rise to the occasion"" he explains. Except they dont. And so Ned can be cited as the unwitting catalyst for all sorts of exasperation and agitation among the people around him. These include his three highly dissimilar sisters Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) a tightly wound journalist; Liz (Emily Mortimer) a messy mom with a pre-K son and a possibly philandering documentary filmmaker husband; and Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) a lesbian who works out her stand-up routines in sparsely populated bars on open-mike nights. Steve Coogan is Lizs pompous (and British) spouse. Rashida Jones is Natalies bow-tied and bespectacled partner (shes very funny). And Adam Scott is Mirandas handy and sympathetic neighbor. All of them for better but mostly for worse have run-ins with Ned. Our Idiot Brother isnt scripted as sharply as it could have been. And while this hugely likable cast is indeed hugely likable no ones sweating things at all. The comedys relaxed moony rhythms imbue it with a certain charm but can result in a certain stop-and-start awkwardness too. Our Idiot Brother wraps things up too neatly and too cutely. Its as if Neds niceness bled onto the screen itself creating a rosy resolution when something a little less affirming may have been in order. But thats a cruel and cynical response on my part to be sure. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Comments click to enlarge Our Idiot Brother Rated R  96 minutes  2011 Paul Rudd stars as a small-town hippie so trusting--or is it stupid?--that in the opening scene he agrees to sell pot to a uniformed police officer. Paroled from prison he returns to the enveloping embrace of his mother and his three unhappy sisters (Elizabeth Banks Emily Mortimer Zooey Deschanel) whose generic personal problems are exacerbated by his stupidity (or is it trust?). Like Nicole Holofceners Please Give (2010) this turns on the friction between an unusually altruistic character and the self-centered people around him though screenwriters David Schisgall and Evgenia Peretz never pursue their premise into the sort of moral comedy that so distinguished the other movie. Given the thinness of the script Im surprised so many name actors signed on; rounding out the cast are Steve Coogan Rashida Jones Adam Scott and Kathryn Hahn.

By    Alonso Duralde on August 25 2011  1110 am Follow aduralde Email Print Related ABC Pisses on Weinstein Co.s Idiot Brother Ad Great cast and occasional laughs arent enough to save a comedy that veers from sweet to mean-spirited -- especially when it comes to the female characters From the poster you might think ""Our Idiot Brother"" has all the elements for a great comedy -- Paul Rudd starring as a sweet stoned doofus opposite a cast of hilarious heavyweights like Elizabeth Banks Emily Mortimer Steve Coogan Zooey Deschanel Rashida Jones and Adam Scott. But something went wrong along the way -- while the film does offer its share of zingy one-liners and entertaining character moments the final result is a movie that cant decide if it wants to be snarkily sweet or mean and misanthropic. Also read ABC Pisses on Weinstein Co.s Idiot Brother Ad And its the female characters for the most part that wind up being the object of the movies venom. Rudds Ned is a holy idiot floating through life on a cloud of naivete and pot smoke. His relatively carefree existence gets upended when he sells weed to a uniformed police officer -- the movie isnt called ""Our Idiot Brother"" for nothing -- and when he gets out of jail Neds girlfriend Janet (Kathryn Hahn) has kicked him off of the upstate New York organic farm where hes been living with her and even more troubling to Ned announces that shes keeping Neds beloved dog Willie Nelson. Ned tries moving back in with his boozy mom (Shirley Knight) on Long Island but he eventually heads to Manhattan where he crashes with each of his sisters with disastrous results. While staying with supermom Liz (Mortmer) Ned helps out on a documentary directed by her husband Dylan (Coogan) and realizes that Dylans having an affair; while hanging out with Vanity Fair reporter Miranda (Banks) he gets an aristocratic interview subject to open up about a past scandal but then refuses to stand by the story when the ruthlessly ambitious Miranda tries to publish it; later he blurts out the fact that untalented comedian Natalie (Deschanel) is pregnant despite the fact that shes supposed to be in a monogamous relationship with lawyer Cindy (Jones as the least convincing butch lesbian in the history of cinema). So basically Ned may be a twit but the real problem is that hes so innocent and his big mouth gets his sisters into trouble because hes shattering the lies that theyve all created about themselves. (Liz should let her son take karate and Miranda shouldnt try to work her way up the ladder on someone elses misery and blah blah blah already.) And while theres certainly a way to spin a modern ""Candide"" about a rube who disrupts the life of city folks and their duplicitous ways ""Our Idiot Brother"" gives us a troika of irritating female characters who need their bumpkin brother to show up to fix their lives for them. Toss in the shrewish and nasty Janet and youve got a bubbling cauldron of misogyny -- in a movie thats incidentally co-written by a woman. (Evgenia Peretz sister of the films director seems to be setting out to slander both her gender and her day-job employer Vanity Fair since it paints the magazine as shallow and dirt-hungry.) Still the cast does what it can to keep things lively. From the misguided pot sale onward -- including a memorable moment in which Ned counts out a giant wad of cash on a crowded NYC subway -- Rudd takes a character who could have been unbelievably dopey and makes him a lovable lamb set loose among the wolves. Banks and Scott generate sexy bristly chemistry as two people who dont want to cop to their mutual attraction and Coogan adds to his gallery of hilarious blowhards. Up-and-comer T.J. Miller makes an impression as Billy Janets new boyfriend the one person in the movie -- perhaps on Earth -- whos on Neds wobbly wavelength. He and Rudd have such great comic rapport that director Jesse Peretz tacked on a new ending after the films Sundance premiere to make it clear that Ned and Billy belong together but like in a totally bro way. So its odd then that a movie that had the potential to be such a humanist comedy treats so many of its human beings so poorly. Why such contempt for most of the female characters? Couldnt Ned have had a brother whose life was also a mess? Its the stench of misogyny that makes this indie comedy go so very sour. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Our Idiot Brother Paul Rudd on a Couch-Crash Course Finally an offbeat summer comedy thats more amiable than outrageous By Mary Pols MaryPolsAug. 23 2011 Share Read Later Nicole Rivelli / The Weinstein CompanyPaul Rudd in a scene from Our Idiot Brother Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Given its title and the summers trend towards crassness you might assume that Our Idiot Brother would feature its star Paul Rudd embarrassing his movie-siblings in the tradition of Hangover 2 Horrible Bosses and The Change-Up. The movies appearance in the studio dumping ground of late August doesnt do much to encourage optimism either. But this gently cunning comedy about family ties includes no humiliating moments of public regurgitation or defecation. Rudd plays Ned an organic farmer who just got out of prison after selling pot to a cop in a uniform. (The guy asked nicely.) Returning to his farm he finds that his dreadlocked ex (Kathryn Hahn) has replaced him with an even more daft and malleable boyfriend (T.J. Miller). Ned not ready to move in with his fluttery mom (Shirley Knight) then alternates between the Manhattan residences of his three sisters depending on who is the least irritated with him at the moment. (See Joel Steins profile of Paul Rudd.) Our Idiot Brother is both daffier and more amiable than a Woody Allen film but the sibling filmmakers (Jesse Peretz directed and his sister Evgenia Peretz co-wrote the screenplay) have concocted sort of a Ned and His Sisters. Liz (Emily Mortimer) whos married with kids has the home thats the most spacious but the least fun. Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) an ambitious but untried writer at Vanity Fair (where Evgenia Peretz is a contributing editor) has a decent couch but little patience. Total bohemian Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) shares a place with her girlfriend (Rashida Jones adorable in over-the-top butch outfits) and many others; the freewheeling atmosphere is the closest match to Neds usual digs and hes lucky to get an air mattress. Even Natalie thinks shes more together than Ned but his presence -- his inability to be anything but genuine -- create change in all of the siblings lives. The brother theyd all written off as hopeless has something to teach them and likewise Rudd has a gift for getting the audience on his side. Ned is not exactly a Chauncey Gardiner figure but he is what some might call too good for this world. (When he catches Lizs nasty documentarian husband played by Steve Coogan shooting an interview with a beautiful Russian ballerina in the nude Ned accepts his word that its a technique to get her to open up about her past.) The movie crafted around Ned is a bit of a shaggy-dog story struggling with the climax and coda but the company is so pleasant and the cast so endearing that other flaws are easy to forgive. Theres no sense of a constant straining for laughs making a nice change from the desperation of this seasons gross-out comedies. Theres even some wisdom to be found here and there. When Liz gets mad that Ned has exposed her son to violence via The Pink Panther Ned explains ""Little boys fight. It doesnt mean hes going to grow up to be a frat boy rapist."" Not such an idiot after all. Mary Pols MaryPols Mary Pols has been reviewing film and occasionally books for TIME since 2009.

Our Idiot Brother reviewed Paul Rudd is a charming stoner neer-do-well. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 25 2011 1148 AM Our Idiot Brother A charming comedy with Paul Rudd as a stoner layabout. By Dana Stevens Adam Scott and Paul Rudd in Our Idiot Brother In its best moments Jesse Peretzs Our Idiot Brother (The Weinstein Company) has the translucent sparkle of one of those French comedies that chronicle the romantic follies of attractive cultured young people. This little movie isnt a fully accomplished farce--it veers toward sentimentality--but the fact that Peretz even gestures in the direction of farce is somehow cheering. It indicates that theres room in the current landscape of American comedy for that venerable subgenre alongside the knuckle-dragging dude comedies and cutely glib rom-coms that currently dominate the screens. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Ned Rochlin (Paul Rudd) is a biodynamic farmer so guileless and trusting that he sells a bag of weed to a uniformed police officer. (To be fair the cops ""just between us bro"" act was a clear case of entrapment.) After he serves his time Ned leaves jail to find that his girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn nailing the passive-aggressive hippie type with precision) has been cheating on him and worse wont relinquish custody of Neds beloved dog Willie Nelson. Advertisement The dazed Ned bounces from one couch to another within his large troubled family. He has three sisters Liz (Emily Mortimer) is a stay-at-home mother of two whos married to a successful scoundrel (Steve Coogan). Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) writes for Vanity Fair; ambitious and aspirational she refuses to consider dating her lovelorn scrub of a neighbor (Adam Scott). And Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) lives with her awesome girlfriend (Rashida Jones) in a loft packed to the rafters with bohemians but cant commit to either a partner or a sexual orientation. Though one of Neds sisters does snap at him to ""grow up"" his problem isnt really one of immaturity. Hes not a dumb-and-dumber afraid-to-commit dude type. Neds more of a holy fool the kind of person wholl not only count a pile of cash on the subway but hand the bills to a stranger to hold while he attends to another task. Naive and unaffected to a fault Ned keeps blundering into situations that hurt or embarrass his sisters. When he inevitably finds himself in trouble again will they be there to help him? I was not just amused but moved by Ned a more nuanced variation of a character Rudd often plays the easygoing stoner like the surf instructor in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. (The other common Rudd role is the Jack Lemmon-esque straight man of I Love You Man.) His Ned--a simple dopey guy who enjoys playing charades with his family and misses the hell out of his dog--is a slight comic exaggeration of a person we all know someone who annoyingly oblivious though they might be always attributes the best intentions to other people. When Liz and her husband kick Ned out for disobeying their rigid rules about parenting he loyally defends them to another sister ""They have their own way of doing things."" Neds gentleness toward his sisters human failings is echoed by the filmmakers Though all three sisters act in petty and self-destructive ways at times they dont come off as villainesses (with the possible exception of Banks Miranda whos pretty unrelievedly awful). Their mother played by Shirley Knight should have been given at least one substantial scene and it would have been interesting to know what happened to the Rochlins father (though honestly I was relieved to be spared another lumbering dad-son backstory). The script was co-written by a couple--David Schisgall and Evgenia Peretz who is the sister of the director--and while it strays into overly broad satire the writers have a sharp ear for the way siblings can hurt and betray each other with a single word. I cant quite account for why the whole of Our Idiot Brother seemed to me greater than the sum of its admittedly modest parts. Maybe its just nice to see a comedy thats about something other than ""Will these guys get laid?"" or ""Which one will she marry?"" For most of the film--nearly all in fact--Rudds character is not forced by the story to go a-courtin. There are no sprints through airports or huge laugh lines or grossout set pieces. Yet this movie has a charming sunniness about it not only thanks to the perma-grin-wearing hero but because the New York settings as shot by Yaron Orbach are suffused in a lovely natural light. ""Your rhubarb is gorgeous"" the cop tells Ned in that first scene just before putting him under arrest and we cant help but agree. Our Idiot Brother has a way of placing the viewer (at least this one) in a Ned-like state of stoner bonhomie. Its all good man. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Our Idiot Brother movie review with Paul Rudd as a flake - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Our Idiot Brother puts the fun in dysfunctionRudds stoner brother brings sweet chaos -- 3 starsAugust 25 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticPaul Rudd and Elizabeth Banks in ""Our Idiot Brother.""Floating through life on a personal high only partly provided by cannabis the bearded Crocs-sporting semiprofessional farmer specializing in organics (or rather ""biodynamics"") is played winningly by Paul Rudd in an enjoyable shamble of a picture called ""Our Idiot Brother.""The character qualifies less as an idiot than as the most trusting soul in America a man of limited ambition but infinite warmth crazier about his golden retriever named Willie Nelson than he is about anyone or anything else in his existence.The concept and marketing of ""Our Idiot Brother"" suggests raunchy arrested-development high jinks on the order of ""Step Brothers"" or to name a couple of pictures Rudd personally made better ""I Love You Man"" and ""Anchorman.""This ones different. Its sweet and low-key. Its very 70s in its vibe which helps when the script veers in and out of formula. Even when the characters (particularly the female ones) threaten two-dimensionality the actors have room to maneuver and create moments that stick.As Ned Rudd runs the show but its not a one-person show. Essentially ""Our Idiot Brother"" is Chekhovs ""Three Sisters"" with an idiot brother an unofficial cousin of The Dude in ""The Big Lebowski."" Early in the film this little Lebowski makes the mistake of selling marijuana to a uniformed police officer at Neds local farmers market. Eight months later Ned leaves prison and returns to the farm to find his girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn) has taken up with another equally addleheaded stoner (T.J. Miller). All Ned wants really is his dog. Which his ex wont give up easily.The three sisters have had a lifetime of Ned being Ned i.e. causing inadvertent chaos. Co-screenwriter Evgenia Peretz a Vanity Fair contributing editor surely sees the weaselly magazine writer played by Elizabeth Banks as a repository of all things Ned is not ambitious selfish tightly coiled. Zooey Deschanel plays the sister closest to Ned in spirit a bisexual artists model whose girlfriend played by Rashida Jones of ""Parks and Recreation"" doesnt know her lover has recently zinged back temporarily over the fence.Meantime the third female sibling played by Emily Mortimer has buried her personality inside the disdainful aura of her husband a philandering documentary filmmaker (Steve Coogan). In various ways the grown sibs of ""Our Idiot Brother"" represent different comical aspects of knucklehead liberalism whether its a penchant for clothing made of flax or Neds amusingly guilty reaction to not being up to accepting an offer made by a swinging couple at a party.Peretz wrote ""Our Idiot Brother"" with her husband documentary filmmaker David Schisgall and though the film doesnt feel like a documentary exactly it doesnt operate according to the usual slam-bang rhythms. As Neds guilelessness causes one relational crisis in his extended family after another the jokes rarely land as conventional punch lines. For example Ned tagging along on his writer-sisters interview with a reclusive socialite ends up in an elevator with the profile subject. Theyre getting along. He asks her on a date. The way she turns him down and his reaction cannot be described really -- merely enjoyed. Director Jesse Peretz (brother of the screenwriter) encourages a loose unforced interplay among his cast members. Some of its routine to be sure. But in a world of aggravating ""Little Fockers""-level shrillness or ""Hangover""-style nastiness ""Our Idiot Brother"" -- small but satisfying -- is a pretty smart cookie.mjphillipstribune.comOur Idiot Brother -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for sexual content including nudity and for language throughout)Cast Paul Rudd (Ned); Elizabeth Banks (Miranda); Zooey Deschanel (Natalie); Emily Mortimer (Liz); Steve Coogan (Dylan); Hugh Dancy (Christian); Kathryn Hahn (Janet); Rashida Jones (Cindy); Shirley Knight (Ilene)Credits Directed by Jesse Peretz; written by Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgall; produced by Anthony Bregman Marc Turtletaub and Peter Saraf.

Ned (Paul Rudd) is a freewheeling soul who communes with nature and assumes that most people he meets are worthy of his trust. His city-dwelling sisters -- high-roller Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) hipster Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) and homemaker Liz (Emily Mortimer) -- dont understand him but thats cool. Ned figures that as long as he has his dog Willie Nelson things cant be too bad.But an unfortunate encounter with a police officer sets off a considerable run of bad karma. Ned is forced to seek help from his sisters who cant hide their lack of enthusiasm and are clearly embarrassed by his laid-back world view.Neither is Dylan (Steve Coogan) Lizs hotshot filmmaker husband particularly glad to see him. But the worst part is Neds former girlfriend Janet (Kathryn Hahn) claims custody of Willie Nelson and refuses to give him up. Ned tries hard to fit in and he finds allies in Mirandas platonic pal Jeremy (Adam Scott) and Natalies life partner Cindy (Rashida Jones). Still Ned is all too aware that the sibling animosity is bound to boil over at any second. And how can he get Willie Nelson back?""Our Idiot Brother"" is a major step forward for director Jesse Peretz whose 2001 film ""The Chateau"" also starred Rudd. Like that earlier comedy the new film has an amiable charm based on closely observed behavior. But ""Our Idiot Brother"" is at once more ambitious and more impressive. Working from a screenplay by his sister Evgenia Peretz and her husband David Schisgall Peretz achieves a rare blend of hilarity and heart.

Share Tweet Paul Rudds charm has seldom been taxed as relentlessly as in Our Idiot Brother which might as well be called Paul Rudd Is Charming The Movie. Despite a cast that includes Rashida Jones Elizabeth Banks T.J. Miller Steve Coogan Emily Mortimer Adam Scott and Zooey Deschanel Our Idiot Brother is a one-man show that leans far too heavily on its leads charisma and likability. Rudd ably carries the film while retaining a light touch though even with Rudd in the lead its still a featherweight trifle an afternoon nap of a feel-good comedy. Rudd stars as a farmer leading a life of mellow contentment and good vibes until a uniformed cop baits him into selling weed and he ends up in prison. Exiled from his hippie paradise upon release Rudd meanders back into the lives of his three sisters desperate would-be comedian Zooey Deschanel who tries to compensate for low self-esteem with promiscuity; depressed mom Emily Mortimer; and uptight striver Elizabeth Banks. Life lessons ensue. Rudd plays the lead as a man so sweet and guileless that hes incapable of the white lies evasions and compromises of adulthood. Hes a simple man of enormous moral and spiritual clarity who infects his hopelessly neurotic sisters with his laissez-faire attitude toward life. Rudd might just be cinemas first Manic Pixie Dream Boy the dynamic is the same--impish life-lover devoid of an inner life or personal needs shakes up the lives of the depressed and anxious--even if the gender dynamics are reversed. Our Idiot Brother still represents a male fantasy only this time its an awesome dude shaking up lives and opening minds. Its just too bad the filmmakers feel the need to surround Rudd with shrill misanthropic caricatures so that his decency and lack of pretension stands out in even sharper relief. Our Idiot Brother is an affable enough time-waster custom-made for casual viewing on cable TV but Rudd deserves better.

"Our Idiot Brother | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; our-idiot-brother ) Our Idiot Brother (United States 2011) August 24 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Lately comedies seem to come in two flavors profane raunch-fests that seek to garner laughs via shock tactics and big-screen sit-coms. Despite Zooey Deschanels repeated utterance of the word ""fuck"" and a dud of a threesome Our Idiot Brother falls squarely into the latter category. Its tame and rather bland and the laughter it generates is half-hearted. Director Jesse Peretz commits the unpardonable sin of wasting the considerable comedic talent of Paul Rudd. The funniest thing about Rudd is his Grizzly Adams beard. Our Idiot Brother is like a horse thats slow to get out of the gate. One keeps expecting it to hit its stride make a mad dash and finish strong but it just falls further and further behind. The title character is Ned whos played with a glazed expression by Rudd. Neds a lot like the Steve Carrell character in Dinner for Schmucks except in this case no one is out to get him. Hes good natured laid back disarmingly truthful and unable to keep a secret. When we first meet him he engages in the unfathomable act of idiocy of selling a bag of weed to a uniformed cop. After a stint in jail he discovers that his girlfriend (Kathyrn Hahn) has moved on and so must he. He has three attractive sisters all of whom are willing to help out Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) and Liz (Emily Mortimer). He spends time living with each of them and systematically destroying their lives mostly by revealing infidelities. For Ned his lifes objective is being reunited with is one true love his beloved pooch Willy Nelson. Aside from Ned whos almost too much of an innocent to laugh at in good conscience Our Idiot Brother is populated by a roster of odious characters - the shrewish Miranda the whimpering and impotent Liz the oversexed Natalie plus a raft of equally unappealing secondary figures. One can understand Neds desire to stay in jail when he gets the chance. In true sit-com style however everything works out cheerfully with characters getting happy finishes instead of justly deserved comeuppances. By the time the end credits arrived I felt like I was drowning in honey. What happened to the idea of following a black comedy to its conclusion? Another problem with Our Idiot Brother aside from its anemic comedy is an inability to offer convincing drama. There are times when the movie wants to be taken seriously but the screenplay lacks the conviction to generate honest emotions and Peretz doesnt have the deftness of touch necessary to navigate the thin line between melodrama and farce. The drama is as wishy-washy as the comedy. When Lizs blinders go up and her life collapses its hard to feel anything for her. Shes a shallow character and the depth of her pain is unconvincing. Thats not a knock on Emily Mortimer who is a good actress but theres only so much she can do with an undercooked screenplay. Our Idiot Brother isnt bad; its just a waste of time. It will probably play better on the small screen than the big one where it feels like a film festival darling with no appeal beyond the isolated bubble of an adoring Park City crowd. There are laughs to be had here but they are fewer and less hearty than they should be and Our Idiot Brother offers so little beyond them that it would be surprising if this title did not end up on the fast track to obscurity.

Ned is a sunny Jesus-haired go-with-the-flow kind of dude who sticks to his word tells it like he sees it and finds the good in everyone. Neds three sisters on the other hand are tightly wound malcontents each character fleshed out by a choice comedienne Single lady Miranda (Elizabeth Banks styled as a hard-edged brunette) is a ruthlessly ambitious magazine journalist. Liz (Emily Mortimer luxuriating in hausfrowsiness) approaches married domesticity and motherhood with grim aspirational zeal reinforced by her pretentious snob of a husband (Steve Coogan offering up some of his always-welcome echt Coogan smarm). And lesbian Natalie (indie-world sprite Zooey Deschanel) is a would-be stand-up comedian who feels compelled to cheat on her swell girlfriend (swell Rashida Jones) a lovely bruiser in Bermuda shorts. Mom (Shirley Knight) meanwhile gets by befogged by copious glasses of white wine. At the beginning of this bouncy bighearted comedy of Capraesque life lessons directed by Jesse Peretz (TVs Important Things With Demetri Martin) happy hippie Ned is generous enough to sell a uniformed cop some weed. This act of moronic kindness lands the holy fool some jail time. When hes sprung he learns that his girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn hilarious as a pacifist feminist perpetually spoiling for a fight) has dumped him kicked him off their organic farm and claimed ownership of Neds beloved dog. (The dog named Willie Nelson is shamelessly milked for every awwww a four-legged costar can add to a human-based plot.) Homeless Ned begins an eventful round of crashing at each sisters home and chaos erupts in each household as his inconvenient honesty exposes the lies and pretensions with which each sibling has built her daily routines. The results are enlightening. Screenwriter Evgenia Peretz (shes the sister of the director and co-wrote the sharp script with David Schisgall) is a contributing editor at Vanity Fair. As it happens fictional sister Miranda works at a version of VF where she connives to write an incisive profile of a rich British chick named Lady Arabella (Janet Montgomery) while Ned gets Lady A chatting just by talking to her like a person. I do wish the movies ending werent so squishy. Its been changed from the finale that Sundance audiences saw earlier this year and now reeks of focus-group testing -- well either that or a lack of confidence in the directors comedy rhythms on the part of The Weinstein Company (which bought the movie in Park City for big money). What was once specific and sparkling is now more blandly glossy and sweet. Our Idiot Brother looks like the set might have been the happiest place on earth for its participants who also include Parks and Recreations Adam Scott and improv comedian T.J. Miller (Cloverfield). Like wow dude even Hugh Dancy pops by for a cameo as a self-serious artist while the divine stage actor and TV regular Julie White (Law amp; Order SVU) steals her scenes as a crackpot guru. As Ned would say -- sincerely beatifically with no embarrassment that Woodstock is so 42 years ago Far out. Right on. Peace.

Our Idiot Brother Fair Director Jesse Peretz. Cast Paul Rudd Elizabeth Banks Zooey Deschanel. Rating R for sexual content including nudity and for language throughout. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Paul Rudd R-rated comedies Family gatherings on film A comedy about a trusting immature man who drives his family crazy with his honesty and the trouble it causes the film actually has a much more serious tone than you might be led to believe. Happily Paul Rudd stars as Ned the man-child at the center of all this. But the script by David Schisgall and Evgenia Peretz does Rudd no favors making what is presumably supposed to be sweet-natured naivete something more akin to well idiocy. If Rudd wasnt so innately likable youd want to smack him. A lot of the time you want to anyway. Top 10 fearless comedy roles The film begins with Ned an organic farmer selling marijuana to a uniformed police officer who tells Ned hes been having a bad week. This establishes Ned as either overly trusting remarkably stupid or both. Ned goes to prison for a time and comes out to find his girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn) has dumped him for another affable hippie (T.J. Miller). Worse she refuses to give Ned back the one thing he loves most his dog Willie Nelson (who is annoyingly referred to by his full name in every instance). So Ned has no choice but to move in with his sisters moving on from one to the next as he disrupts their lives. Its temping to say disrupts their happiness but since theyre all miserable theres no need. A put-upon uptight Liz (Emily Mortimer) lives rather unhappily with her children and her husband Dylan (Steve Coogan) a pretentious filmmaker whose intimacy with his documentary subject Ned lets slip. So its on to Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) a cutthroat Vanity Fair writer who thinks nothing of selling out sources - which is to say Ned through an unlikely series of events - to get a story. Shes a real shrew but once Ned does the right thing she gives him the boot. He shows up next at the door of Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) whose affection for her partner Cindy (Rashida Jones) doesnt prevent her from sleeping around with a guy. This leads to complications which of course Ned cant help making worse. In this movie thats more or less his job. Except in the skewed logic of the film Neds a sort of messiah savant; his unerring belief in the goodness of the world and its residents may lead him to mess up his sisters lives but it also shows them the errors of their ways. A too-happy ending threatens to make idiots of us all. Yet there is Rudd to reclaim a few IQ points. The rest of the cast is fine actually but Rudd spares nothing in making Ned a lovable loser with the emphasis on ""loser."" There is a certain satisfaction in seeing people as self-centered as his sisters get their comeuppance I suppose but the reason to watch ""Our Idiot Brother"" is to see Rudd whose presence is always welcome. Ned may be an idiot after all but Rudd is nothing of the sort. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

A wannabe-feel-good comedy that turns out to be as cruel as its title ""Our Idiot Brother"" tells the story of the worlds nicest man-child screw-up and the redemptive havoc he wreaks on his three horribly self-absorbed sisters. Pic needs every ounce of goodwill it can wring from Rudds likable lead performance to offset a sour borderline misogynistic streak for which scattered snickers offer only modest compensation. Cast names should prop up returns for a slick effort that straddles indie and mainstream sensibilities but fails to muster the big laughs and bigger heart that couldve made it a crossover hit. A bearded long-haired slacker so gullible that he gives everyone the benefit of the doubt New Yorker Ned Rochlin (Rudd) makes the colossally foolish mistake of selling marijuana to a uniformed cop. Released from prison shortly after the opening credits Ned finds hes been dumped by his organic-farmer g.f. Janet (Kathryn Hahn recently seen with Rudd in ""How Do You Know"") who has moved on and taken custody of his dog. Homeless jobless and clueless Ned seeks shelter and assistance from each of his three sisters all of whom look down on this underachieving black sheep. First he stays with Liz (Emily Mortimer) a mother of two whos unaware that her filmmaker husband Dylan (Steve Coogan) is cheating on her with one of his documentary subjects. When that living arrangement doesnt work out Ned crashes with Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) a Vanity Fair writer willing to sell her soul for a salacious cover story. Finally he hits up Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) whos not quite ready to commit to lesbian partner Cindy (Rashida Jones). Ned keeps moving of course because he drives each of his sisters crazy. As played by Rudd finding every comic grace note in the characters often maddening stupidity Ned is so friendly carefree and lacking in guile that he naturally invites others to share their secrets with him; unfortunately he also has a habit of innocently dropping those secrets in casual conversation with disastrous results. Yet the crux of Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgalls screenplay is that Ned for all his screw-ups is the one person onscreen who understands whats really important in life -- love and laughter family and friends -- and therefore the one person capable of indirectly showing his shrill sisters how hollow miserable and unfulfilled they are. In short with the exception of Neds kindly mother (Shirley Knight) whose sole vice seems to be a slight alcohol dependency to be a woman in ""My Idiot Brother"" is to be a heartless hippie a weak-willed spouse a bitchy careerist or a callous nymphomaniac. (Admittedly men dont have much more attractive options judging by Ned and the supporting roles played by Adam Scott Hugh Dancy and T.J. Miller.) Any attempt on the part of helmer Jesse Peretz (who previously directed Rudd in 2001s ""The Chateau"") to present complicated messy lives onscreen is canceled out by the scripts alternately soapy and sitcomish formulations all of which are tidied up with a veritable montage of canned happy endings. Mortimer Banks and Deschanel appealing actresses all are ill-served by a script that at one point has the audience all but clamoring for their blood. Tech credits are topnotch notably Yaron Orbachs polished lensing of various Gotham locales.

Rudd portrays Ned Rochlin a happy-go-luck organic farmer abruptly busted for selling pot to a police officer. Kicked out of his home by his moody ex-girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn) Ned loses possession of his faithful dog and winds up crashing at his moms house. There he seeks help from his three sisters played by Elizabeth Banks Zooey Deschanel and Emily Mortimer. Director Jesse Peretz guides them through an innocuous mostly unmemorable series of events in which Ned introduces added dramas to each of their lives. The only reason to keep watching is Rudds investment in the business of being funny. [Editors Note This review was originally published during indieWIREs coverage of the 2011 Sundance Film Festival where ""Our Idiot Brother"" had its world premiere. The film hits theaters this Friday August 26 through The Weinstein Company.] The crux of the story finds Ned drifting from one sisters home to another vaguely attempting to find a job but mostly just hanging around. Spending time with his ostensibly settled suburban sister Liz (Mortimer) he ends up corrupting her spoiled seven-year-old son and inadvertently discovering the adulterous behavior of her documentarian husband (Steve Coogan). Neds antics impact lesbian sister Natalie (Deschanel) as well when he accidentally lets loose about her heterosexual trysts to her faithful partner (Rashida Jones). With journalist sister Miranda (Banks) Ned accidentally throws her job into jeopardy. After each of these incidents Ned finds himself alienated by his kin and fed up with the way he has been viewed as a failure. A few developments later and the stage is set for reconciliation. Intermittently engaging ""My Idiot Brother"" proceeds through several lackluster scenarios until its overly neat ending a resoundingly uninventive setup that asks very little of its talented ensemble cast that hasnt been hashed out a million times before. The end result feels by and large quite tolerable -- but simply humming along isnt enough to justify a full-length feature. In fact the name and the premise of ""Our Idiot Brother"" would work better for a sitcom or maybe several of them. Rudds commitment to Neds free-spirited behavior takes his performative abilities in an intriguing direction departing from the everyday joe hes embodied in recent mainstream comedies. Peretz gives Rudd plenty of opportunities to display his range but not enough substance to the scenario for the character to stand on firm ground. Going through the usual motions ""Our Idiot Brother"" is about as oblivious as Ned. HOW WILL IT PLAY? Snatched up by The Weinstein Company for several million dollars after its world premiere at Sundance the movies diverse star power means it will be positioned as having strong commercial appeal. But no trailer could possibly sell it as anything other than a conventional middle-of-the-road comedy so even a strong opening wont sustain it for very long. criticWIRE grade C+ This Article is related to Reviews and tagged In Theaters Our Idiot Brother-2 More From IndieWireHow to Scare Yourself Shtless This Halloween A Viewers Guide (VIDEO)Exclusive Aja Naomi King Talks About Sci-Fi Thriller Reversion and the Power of Memories - Now in TheatersTwo Limited Release Films Also Opening This Weekend That You Might Be Interested in Seeing...Here Are All the Movies Opening Today January 9.

Ever since he broke out in the 1995 Jane Austen-goes-to-the-Valley romp Clueless earning teen idol status for the somewhat questionable act of kissing his underage onscreen step-sister Paul Rudd has carved out a niche for himself in Hollywood as the go-to hapless everyman. Most of his roles fall into two categories the hapless disarming romantic lead (I Love You Man How Do You Know) and the hapless hammy sidekick (Anchorman The 40-Year-Old Virgin Wet Hot American Summer). But in Our Idiot Brother a warm and witty comedy from brother-sister team Jesse and Evgenia Peretz Mr. Rudd has found a perfect role that showcases his considerable charm and comic talent without robbing him of his hap. This is not to say that Ned the titular ""idiot brother"" isnt occasionally very unlucky. A laid-back biodynamic farmer fond of Crocs and Fair Isle sweaters Ned finds himself in jail after naively selling pot to a uniformed police officer only to return home a few months later to find that his girlfriend (Kathryn Hahn sporting a head full of dreadlocks and an air of delightful deluded self-righteousness) has taken a new lover/farmhand and wants him gone. Robbed of his paycheck his dignity and his beloved golden retriever Willie Nelson Ned moves back in with his mother (Shirley Knight) but soon prevails upon his three Manhattanite sisters to put him up while he figures out his next step. One by one he unwittingly ruins their lives with his granola-crunchy goodwill. The oldest sister Liz (Emily Mortimer) is a mousy insecure stay-at-home mom married to pompous documentary filmmaker Dylan (Steve Coogan in a role that seems to be a send-up of first-time screenwriter--and real life documentarian--David Schisgall). Dylan reluctantly agrees to give Ned a low-paying production assistant job in exchange for free childcare but neither works out well. To Liz and Dylans horror Ned allows their son River to watch The Pink Panther after bedtime and teaches him mixed martial arts after noticing how badly River wants to join a karate class instead of the all-girls modern dance class his parents have enrolled him in. And at work Ned walks in on Dylan in flagrante with his prima ballerina subject (ever the innocent Ned buys Dylans excuse that nakedness encourages uninhibited interviews). When Liz and Dylan send him packing Ned takes up residence on the couch of middle sister Miranda (Elizabeth Banks playing a variation of her ruthlessly ambitious utterly narcissistic 30 Rock character) a neurotic Vanity Fair staffer--just like co-writer Evgenia Peretz--on the verge of her big break a feature interview with an heiress fresh out of a scandalous relationship thats been the toast of the tabloids. But Miranda doesnt have the grace or guts to ask tough questions coming away with a puff piece about the socialites pet charity. Its only the gregarious Ned whos able to unwittingly coax the real story out of the buttoned-up P.R.-wary subject and Miranda wastes no time in attempting to exploit her brothers knowledge for professional gain. But Neds good intentions get in the way of his sisters agenda--in addition to sabotaging her article he meddles in Mirandas personal life trying to make sparks fly with her next-door neighbor and best friend Jeremy (Adam Scott)--and soon hes pounding the pavement once again. The final youngest sister Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is a struggling stand-up comedian in a loving lesbian relationship with a woman named Cindy (Rashida Jones forced for some reason by the costume designer to dress like Peewee Herman) who maintains a dangerous flirtation with a male artist friend (Hugh Dancy). When Natalie makes an impetuous mistake with life-altering ramifications Ned is there to support her--until he accidentally spills the beans to Cindy. Now all three sisters arent speaking to him he still misses Willie Nelson and hes back in jail thanks to an ill-advised heart-to-heart with his parole office (turns out youre not supposed to tell them when you get high with the kid across the street). With his Jesus beard earnest eco-friendliness and childlike naivete Ned is unquestionably a stereotype (think The Big Lebowskis The Dude merged with Tom Hanks in Big) and in the hands of any other actor his hippie-dippy laissez-faire follies might become unbearable after the first 30 minutes. But Mr. Rudd imbues Ned with an easy charming sweetness and unpatronizing wisdom that make him seem simply guileless not stupid. Indeed the greatest flaw of Our Idiot Brother is in making Ned too saintly--despite the title its clearly the sisters who are the morons. Petty vapid and criminally self-absorbed they blame Ned for being the only person to identify the problems keeping them from being happy ... until they realize in a neat somewhat lazy wrap-up that qualifies in Oprah-speak as an ""aha moment"" that by ruining their lives Ned actually has fixed them. Oh well. It is to the credit of the filmmakers that they manage to recoup and give the movie an ending thats as winning and winsome as its star. Our Idiot Brother may not be perfect but Crocs and all Paul Rudds performance is idiot-proof. ulamarcheobserver.com Running time 90 minutes Written by Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgall Directed by Jesse Peretz Starring Paul Rudd Zooey Deschanel Elizabeth Banks Emily Mortimer 3/4 Comment Filed under Columns Comedy Elizabeth Banks Emily Mortimer lifestyle Mothers Superior movie movie reviews opinion Paul Rudd Zooey Deschanel Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Milo Yiannopoulos Does Not Deserve Twitter Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/08/paul-rudd-charms-as-an-ingenuous-drifter-in-our-idiot-brother/,200,ouridiotbrother34,ouridiotbrother,observer

In the films first scene Ned is ""entrapped"" into selling pot at a farmers market to a uniformed police officer and is swiftly sent to jail.As stupid as he may seem from the get-go Brother doesnt want us to write off Ned as an actual idiot--selling pot to a cop is obviously dumb but its also the result of a genuine selfless faith that other people are not only as pure-hearted as he is but also that when they talk theyre actually saying what they mean. After being released from jail Ned enters a world in which slippery language covers for adaptable notions of right and wrong and the process by which he realizes this--and even tries to good-naturedly fight against it--is the movie.Post-prison Ned discovers that his longtime girlfriend Janet (Kathryn Hahn) has taken up with a new dude rendering Ned both homeless--which he seems more or less prepared to roll with--and also estranged from his beloved dog Willie Nelson who Janet insists is rightfully hers being that the drifter who left the pooch at their place was her friend. Determined to reunite with his dog but first needing to get back on his feet Ned surfs the couches of his three sisters in the City. First dowdy mom Liz (Emily Mortimer) offers her brother pocket money in exchange for minding her young son and assisting her documentary-filmmaker husband (Steve Coogan) a pompous sleazebag who uses his camera as a key into his subjects pants. After Neds oblivious ways burn that bridge he ends up at the bachelorette pad of Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) a high-maintenance low-scruples would-be reporter working on her first big assignment for a glossy magazine. Neds guileless naivete causes problems there too and soon hes crashing with his bi-curious hipster sis Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) at the loft she shares with her lawyer girlfriend Cindy (Rashida Jones masculinized in shorts and bow ties in a costume departments ludicrous notion of Williamsburg butch). Would you believe that Ned is doomed to screw up this cohabitation too?This rarely laugh-out-loud dysfunctional-sibling comedy is in some sense a family affair It was directed by Lemonheads bassist-turned-filmmaker Peretz from a script by his sister Vanity Fair contributor Evgenia Peretz and her husband documentary filmmaker David Schisgall. If its intended as a roman a clef of the clans actual dynamic its more narcissistic than comically incisive or revealing. Coogans husband is a cartoon villain and Miranda the character who would seem to be informed by Ms. Peretzs professional experience (she said in an interview that Graydon Carter ""suggested some changes to make it more realistic"") is defined primarily by her hairstyle and addiction to fro-yo. (Banks does have nicely barbed chemistry with Adam Scott playing a cynical love/hate interest in a subplot given too little time.) And with the movie siblings given no father to speak of theres no counterpart to the Peretz family patriarch former New Republic editor Marty--a shame as the elder Peretzs tendency toward controversy (rumored to be not-so-secretly gay blogging slurs against Muslims) could have given this film some much-needed dramatic friction and maybe even forced some semblance of the real world to bleed into its bourgie bubble.The few direct lines drawn by the filmmakers to their real lives are all the more striking because Our Idiot Brother does such a half-assed job of reflecting the ways in which real people communicate. Its roundelay of shallow types (played by beautiful movie stars) treating one another badly and having whiny conversations about said treatment is such a whisper-soft version of social critique that it makes the autobiographical films of Nicole Holofcener (Please Give Friends With Money) look as cutting as the films of Jean Eustache.And then it gets worse In the films final act the Ned character is revealed as a patent device to teach everyone around him the lessons that will transform them into Better People--to the point where the character exits the City with the line ""My work here is done"" That may be Our Idiot Brothers one gift to the indie ensemble-com canon. In allowing wayward white people to find salvation from a selfless outsider-drifter-saint who is actually part of their own bloodline the film gives permission for a genre already prone to solipsism to finally close in on itself entirely.

TWITTER It may be no worse than Paul Rudds latest vehicle ""How Do You Know"" but its yet another leading role that fails to live up to the actors talent. Paul Rudds Ned Rochlin recently released from jail and broke wanders through his three sisters homes inadvertently revealing that each has as much to answer for as their brother who sold dope to a policeman in uniform. Each episode yields laughs but the many parallel screw-ups dont build to the kind of crescendo the film needs; it may be no worse than Rudds latest vehicle How Do You Know but its yet another leading role that fails to live up to Rudds talent and its hard to imagine it approaching the commercial success of his more high-concept studio comedies. The script doesnt play to anyones strengths in fact requiring each member of this top-flight cast to play a part slightly (sometimes more than slightly) duller and less likeable than his usual fare. Sisters played by Emily Mortimer Zooey Deschanel and Elizabeth Banks are respectively de-sexed dumbed-down and unbelievably self-centered; their ample flaws might have been humanized if it werent for the contempt they show their only brother. READ Elizabeth Banks Qamp;A The filmmakers arent so kind to Ned themselves. Screenwriters Evgenia Peretz and David Schisgall try to have it both ways by assigning a ""give everyone the benefit of the doubt"" philosophy to his seemingly low-IQ behavior but this rationale appears in just one small chunk of dialogue and hardly explains the clueless things they require Ned to say and do. Much is made of a dog named Willie Nelson stolen from Ned by his hateful hippie ex-girlfriend and seemingly the only entity (aside from his alcoholic Mom) who offers the kind-hearted lug the unconditional love he deserves. Willie serves as the fulcrum of the movies ludicrous redemption sequence but more persuasive evidence of Neds soulfulness languishes on the sidelines -- a friendship with his overprotected nephew derailed by an accident so dumb viewers might decide protestations notwithstanding that this movie really doesnt think much of its hero. Editors note This film was reviewed under the title ""My Idiot Brother.""
