Alexandre Dumas classic tale of injustice and comeuppance revenge and redemption is rousingly retold in ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" a lavishly mounted and appealingly old-fashioned swashbuckler with nary a trace of wink-wink irony or revisionist embellishment. With a well-cast Jim Caviezel establishing star credentials in the title role and a first-rate supporting cast led by Guy Pearce and Richard Harris pic boasts a compelling human element to complement lively storytelling and sporadic action highlights. Strong cross-generational appeal should ensure good-to-excellent biz during theatrical run and countless rentals when pic resurfaces on homevid. Scripter Jay Wolpert does an intelligent job of compressing and reconstituting his source material remaining faithful to the spirit -- and to a surprising degree the letter -- of Dumas original narrative. Wolpert even manages to clarify for contemporary auds the squabbles of opposing political forces in 19th century France in the wake of Napoleon Bonapartes banishment to Elba. Drama begins as Edmond Dantes (Caviezel) an idealistic young French sailor leads a boatload of companions to Elba in search of medical help for their ships captain. Unfortunately the captain dies. Even more unfortunately Dantes naively accepts a message from Bonaparte (an authoritative cameo by Alex Norton) to deliver to one of the banished emperors friends back in France. Once home Dantes resumes his romance with the beautiful Mercedes (Dagmara Dominczyk). But Dantes best buddy Fernand Mondego (Pearce) a moneyed and amoral libertine also desires the fair maiden. And hes not the kind of guy who lets friendship get in the way. With the eager assistance of Villefort (James Frain) a magistrate desperate to hide his fathers inconvenient allegiance to Napoleon and Danglars (Albie Woodington) a veteran first mate with long-standing grievances against our hero Mondego arranges for Dantes to be arrested for trying to deliver the message from Elba. Dantes is summarily shipped off to Chateau DIf a hellish island prison where the sadistic warden (Michael Wincott) celebrates the anniversary of each prisoners arrival with a brutal flogging. Dantes endures 13 such whippings before Abbe Faria (Harris) a long-imprisoned solider-turned-cleric mistakenly burrows into Dantes cell while attempting to escape. As the two men forge strong bonds during long months of tunneling Faria teaches Dantes how to handle a sword and where to find a long-hidden treasure. After making his escape briefly joining a band of pirates and earning the unstinting loyalty of Jacopo (Luis Guzman) a comic-relief cutthroat who becomes his faithful companion Dantes follows Farias directions to the fortune stashed on the island of Monte Cristo. Armed with more money than you can shake a stick at plus the stick he returns to France and establishes himself as -- yes you guessed it -- the Count of Monte Cristo. Disguised with a new identity he launches a meticulous plot to punish his betrayers. And hes all the more eager to mete out rough justice when he discovers that Mercedes thinking him dead married Mondego. Helmer Kevin Reynolds has previously tried his hand at larger-than-life adventure stories -- ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" ""Waterworld"" -- with wildly uneven results. With ""Count of Monte Cristo"" however he proves to be fully on top of his game infusing the grandly melodramatic permutations of the plot with firm conviction and stylish gusto. Under Reynolds direction Caviezel offers a galvanizing performance as a guileless innocent who must evolve into a remorseless avenger before finding peace and contentment. Pearce effectively underplays in a role rife with opportunities for scenery-chewing and Harris makes his every onscreen moment count as a font of hard-won wisdom. Dominczyk doesnt appear to age a day but shes otherwise credible as a sympathetic pawn in a deadly game. Even when it comes to shading the dead-serious adventure with darkly comical touches Reynolds maintains a sure steady hand. Guzman is richly amusing (and acceptably anachronistic) while Wincott makes a deliciously hissable villain as the warden. But each actor is attuned to the overall tone and neither pushes too hard. Other supporting players are first-rate. Tech package is exceptional. Special credit must go to Andrew Dunns splendid color lensing of locations in Ireland and Malta as well as Tom Rands evocative subtly character-defining costumes; from the look of Dantes Near Eastern-flavored attire after he becomes the mysterious count aud gets a vivid impression of just how far he traveled while on the winding road toward a final reckoning.

USATODAY.com - Classic Count is pleasant if a bit hammy Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 01/28/2002 - Updated 0921 AM ET Classic Count is pleasant if a bit hammy By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Richard Harris in The Count of Monte Cristo. Lets count the many Cristos. There have been at least four films made of Alexander Dumas classic tale of betrayal and retribution three TV movies and another three TV series. Its unclear why filmmakers think the story needs to be retold. Yes its a swashbuckling tale of romance adventure and retribution but the retellings underscore how Hollywood tends toward retreads rather than the new and innovative. But putting that aside and judging purely on its merits this Count adds up to pleasant diversion. This adaptations plot holds no big surprises. Jim Caviezel plays Edmund Dantes who seems bound for a happy life until Fernand Mondego (Guy Pearce) falsely accuses him of treason and steals his fiancee (Dagmara Dominczyk). Dantes is exiled to prison where he languishes for 13 years consumed by thoughts of revenge. He escapes enacts his vengeance and finally finds peace. The Count of Monte Cristo (out of four) Stars Jim Caviezel Guy Pearce Richard Harris Luis Guzman Dagmara Dominczyk Director Kevin Reynolds Distributor Walt Disneys Touchstone Pictures Rating PG-13 for adventure violence/swordplay and some sensuality Caviezel manages to be both brooding and dashing as Dantes the principled innocent who hardens into a shrewdly determined cynic. His dark good looks and penetrating blue eyes coupled with his action-hero moves should attract lots of new fans. But besides being handsome Caviezel is compelling as he progresses from God-fearing do-gooder to a faithless prisoner and finally to a mysterious and worldly gentleman. The ease with which he makes these transitions is all the more marked when played against the over-the-top posturing of Pearces Mondego. In the book Mondego is a distant acquaintance of Dantes but in this version he is Dantes jealous childhood friend turned mortal enemy. Pearce snivels and smirks his way through the movie coming off more mincing than menacing. Richard Harris plays Dantes fellow prisoner and mentor Abbe Faria. During their confinement Faria educates the illiterate Dantes and provides a means for his escape. Alas Harris occasionally slips into his Professor Dumbledore persona from Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone intoning and pontificating with wizardly wisdom. The worst acting of all though belongs to Luis Guzman as Jacopo Dantes right-hand man. Guzman inexplicably plays his role with a thick Bronx accent which drew laughs at inappropriate times from a packed screening audience. Guzman has given superb performances in several films including Steven Soderberghs Out of Sight The Limey and Traffic so his performance here is mystifying. Despite these flaws Kevin Reynolds direction is well paced and suspenseful (unlike his work on the waterlogged Water World starring that other Kevin). For younger audiences drawn by the attractive actors this might be their introduction to the Dumas epic. At least its an effective and rousing version.

Starring Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce. Directed by Kevin Reynolds. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This new movie version of the Alexandre Dumas classic is the stuff of high romance brought off with considerable wit too. People are going to love it. In the title role of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" Jim Caviezel (""The Thin Red Line"") is completely sympathetic as the foolishly trusting and wrongly imprisoned man who turns into an unrelenting avenger. If Guy Pearce often seems to be acting with impacted teeth he still has his moments as the villain who steals his friends betrothed. It is the Napoleonic era and naive sailor Edmond Dantes (Caviezel) not only meets the great man on Elba but he also gets set up and ends up in a dungeon. Able he was ere he saw Elba . . . LOVER STOLEN Treacherous Fernand Mondego (Pearce) comforts the heartbroken Mercedes (Polish stunner Dagmar Dominiczyk) all the way to the boudoir. Thirteen years pass. This movie falls into three parts like an ex-cons life riding for a fall hard time and rehab except in this case it isnt rehabilitation but elaborate revenge which is even better. Thats why they call it sweet. Caviezel is the big surprise. In a film such as ""Pay It Forward"" the actor comes across as twitchy and needy which works fine for him in ""Monte Cristo"" when hes just an innocent and apparently not too bright sailor. The surprise comes after Dantes transformation into the formidable and fabulously wealthy count. Caviezel turns into a splendid romantic hero the effect enhanced by his light-textured voice. If Ralph Fiennes isnt careful Caviezel may elbow him out of the way. Pearce is something else. The star of ""Memento"" and ""Priscilla Queen of the Desert"" has always reminded me of an alley cat. In the last segment of ""Monte Cristo"" Pearce leads with his teeth (""Can you tone down the sneer a bit Guy?"") and Fernand has developed a very peculiar accent after 13 years of marriage to Mercedes. Pearces weasellyness works in the operatic climax and he also is a very aggressive swordsman. ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is filled with yeasty characters. Richard Harris is especially good right from the moment of his unexpected entrance during the dungeon years as an imprisoned priest who becomes Dantes mentor. For Samp;M fans Michael Wincott is the warden who visits Dantes once a year to give him a beating like the clock striking midnight on New Years Eve. Director Kevin Reynolds collaborator with Kevin Costner on ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" and ""Waterworld"" has made a movie that is better than either of those. It is totally absorbing. Reynolds employs an indirect manner of storytelling that allows key points to dawn on the audience. The absence of heavy-handedness is very refreshing. INTENTIONALLY HOKEY In other respects the movie tilts toward a hokeyness that seems intentional. The count makes his entrance Cirque du Soleil style in a hot- air balloon. Luis Guzman as Dantes servant is permitted to overact -- a little hot air there too. In prison the thought of revenge keeps Dantes alive. By the time the climax rolls around this movie offers the viewer an opportunity to identify with anger -- a deep smoldering anger -- and vengeance all the while maintaining a tone of high-mindedness. Not a bad combination. Advisory This film contains scenes of brutality.

Oddly the absurdities have nothing to do with Reynolds who has brought us Kevin Costner as a blow-dried Robin Hood in ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" (1991) and cigar-chomping post-apocalyptic Jet Skiers (and Costner again) in ""Waterworld"" (1995). This ""Monte Cristo"" screenplay -- by Jay Wolpert a former producer of ""The Price is Right"" -- proves yet again that what plays brilliantly when youre turning the pages of a good book can look especially silly on a big screen. Dont be surprised if youre chuckling at this one even as youre getting lost in Dumas intricate story line. Jim Caviezel plays Edmond Dantes an uneducated sailor who for reasons that are hardly evident has been the lifelong friend of a conniving elitist named Fernand (Guy Pearce). When their ships captain falls ill from ""brain fever"" Edmond and Fernand row him ashore at the secluded island on which British soldiers are holding Napoleon Bonaparte (Alex Norton) captive. Once there Napoleon hands Edmond a letter that he wants secretly delivered to a friend on the mainland. Edmond who cant read accepts the letter thinking its an innocent correspondence. Whoops.
