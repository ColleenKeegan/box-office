In fact this ad-agency-like adaptation of Louis De Bernieres 1994 book-club favorite turns the historical novel into a travel brochure. Which is a problem since the book is about big stuff like romantic passion patriotism moral conflict and World War II. The movie by contrast is Pearl Harbor for the English Patient crowd - a movie that reduces history as well as eros to a postcard. As directed with no points for subtlety by Shakespeare in Loves John Madden from an empurpled script by Shawn Slovo the Greek townsfolk in this history-inspired story glow with ethnic pride. Then they dance. Life is hard but photogenic. Put it this way Handsome Christian Bale plays Mandras the fisherman who becomes a partisan and handsome Irene Papas glowers Zorba-riffically as Mandras mother. Then life gets even harder and occasionally tragic Mussolini sends Italian troops to occupy the island; the mandolin-wielding Italian captain of the title (Nicolas Cage) a Romeo with a fondness for Puccini arias falls in love with Pelagia (Penelope Cruz) a beautiful Greek maiden; her physician father (John Hurt) worries and philosophizes; Mandras fumes because Pelagia is his intended; and the spilled blood of war stains the soil of Cephalonia itself. As with Pearl Harbor the battle scenes display more ardor than the ""hot"" triangular love story. And similarly Mandolin miscalculates the weight the romantic leads are capable of bearing. Both Cage and Cruz (ever since shes been hugged by Hollywood anyway) are such slo-mo creatures so prone to conveying dampness when they aim for smolder that the passion between Corelli and his Pelagia is indistinguishable from the affection the captain demonstrates for his mandolin. On this island theirs is a tourist kind of love.

But pic still boasts enough physical values to play a pleasant enough tune with general auds looking for an uncomplicated two hours in the cinema. Succulently shot on the actual Greek locations ""Captain Corellis Mandolin"" strikes too many false notes on the dramatic side to add up to a satisfying emotional experience. As the Italian officer of the title who plucks a Greek girls heartstrings during WWII Nicolas Cage never really convinces despite game playing by Penelope Cruz as his vis-a-vis and some fine supporting performances. Notwithstanding this central weakness and a failure to distill the sheer richness of Louis de Bernieres bestselling novel to the bigscreen pic still boasts enough physical values to play a pleasant enough tune with general auds looking for an uncomplicated two hours in the cinema. However this Working Title production will fall way short of returns enjoyed by companys other cult-book-to-pic ""Bridget Joness Diary."" It world-preems May 4 in the U.K. and is set for an August release Stateside through Universal. The 1994 novel by former British schoolteacher De Bernieres enjoys an almost iconic status in the U.K. where it reportedly has sold 1.5 million copies. However the sheer scope of its narrative (stretching from 1940 to 1993) its rambling construction and its immensely detailed depiction of Greek life and history present almost insuperable problems for any screen adaptation. (Corelli a rather indistinct figure only appears a third of the way into the novel which is emotionally centered on the Greek girl Pelagia.) Much as in ""Bridget Jones"" which is equally unfilmable in its book form the decision was wisely made to flatten out the novel into a more regular wartime romance between a local and a representative of the occupying forces. However the script by Shawn Slovo (""A World Apart"") while remaining true to the book in several incidentals lacks a big enough vision of its own to completely replace De Bernieres template. As well as featuring a final reel that cant seem to make up its mind whether to go for an old-fashioned happy ending several characters -- from Pelagias mother-in-law to an Italian soldier who has an unrequited passion for Corelli -- are sidelined to such an extent that they confuse matters by still being there. Impressive opening taken straight from the novel promises an adaptation that will catch something of De Bernieres quirky semi-ironic style as the grizzled Dr. Iannis (John Hurt) extracts a pea from the ear of a deaf local (Gerasimos Skiadaresis) in Argostoli on the island of Cephallonia in 1940. Greece is not yet a part of WWII and life on the idyllic island is carrying on as it has for centuries with Iannis pretty teenage daughter Pelagia (Penelope Cruz) enamored of a local fisherman Mandras (Christian Bale). With Stephen Warbecks bigscreen score and John Tolls luscious widescreen lensing theres an impressive romantic sweep to the movie in the opening stages as well as a sardonic tone that captures much of De Bernieres literary style. When news comes that the Italian army has invaded nearby Albania Mandras after formally becoming Pelagias fiance sets off to fight the enemy leaving both Pelagia and his saturnine mom (veteran Irene Pappas) behind. As time rolls on Greece loses the war and Italian troops occupy the island while the Germans take over the mainland. In a particularly funny scene the proud locals say they will officially surrender only to a German officer. The soldier whose job it is to translate is Capt. Antonio Corelli (Cage) who ends up lodging at Iannis home. With their easygoing attitudes and love of music the Italians soon win the liking of the Cephallonians and life almost returns to normal. Sparks also begin to fly between Pelagia who thinks Mandras died on the Albanian front and Corelli whose own love of music extends to the mandolin. However when Mandras secretly returns alive as a member of the guerrilla movement and the Allied forces advance on Greece relationships are thrown back into the broiler especially when Italy surrenders to the Allies and the German forces under the command of Capt. Weber (David Morrissey) are instructed to first disarm and then dispose of the pesky Italians. With its multitude of characters and historical-political backgrounding theres enough material in the novel for an epic three-hour movie. Early on Slovos script clearly decides to go for the romance between Corelli and Pelagia but theres a singular lack of chemistry between the two actors to match the physical scope of the picture. Never at his best in straight romantic roles Cage looks stiff and uncomfortable as the Italian officer capturing neither the characters attractive brio nor the romantic soulfulness expressed through his mandolin playing. In a key scene where Corelli plays a soulful melody dedicated to Pelagia one night in a taverna the movie momentarily nails the attraction between the two that cannot be expressed in words. But when the storys tragic gears start to lock later on the love story becomes just one of too many subplots jostling for attention. Although she doesnt really look the part Cruz is fine within the constraints of the script; but against Cages low-wattage playing shes largely paddling upstream. In a role he could play standing on his head Hurt is very good as Cruzs rambunctious but understanding father and Morrissey also is excellent as a ""good German"" torn between simple humanity and orders from above; but other thesps including Bale and Pappas make little impression in diminished parts. Pics physical look is always impressive with lifelike in situ sets by production designer Jim Clay and impressive action sequences late on as first Allied bombing and later an earthquake devastate the protagonists lives. The fumbled final reel however fails to either satisfactorily resolve the central love story or recapture the pics opening tone as the villagers seek to re-establish traditional values. Decision to equip everyone with slight accents gives the movie an old-fashioned feel but is acceptable in the circumstances especially given the mixed nationalities of the thesps themselves. Helmer John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") came on board at a late stage after skedded director Roger Michell (""Notting Hill"") suffered a heart attack prior to start of filming in May 2000.

During World War II the Italian army with support from its German allies occupied Greece and her massive chain of islands. When Italy fell to the U.S. Army the Italians on the Greek island of Cephallonia refused to turn their weapons over to the Germans correctly predicting that the Germans couldnt be trusted. For nine bloody days the Italians held out before being overwhelmed and then rounded up and executed by their former allies. A reported 10000 men were murdered. From this hideous chapter of history came the acclaimed book by Bernieres and this screenplay by Shawn Slovo which has been made into a film by Oscar-nominated director John Madden (1998s ""Shakespeare In Love""). Superimposed on this historical event is a ill-fated love triangle between a beautiful local island girl Pelagia (Penelope Cruz) a handsome fisherman Mandras (Christian Bale) and a soulful Italian soldier Captain Antonio Corelli (Nicolas Cage). Life on the idyllic island of Cephallonia is calm slow and predictable. Pelagia the daughter of the islands only doctor (John Hurt) is betrothed to Mandras with the approval of his formidable mother Drosoula played by the legendary Greek actress Irene Papas.

Then after they see how Shakespeare in Love director John Madden has reshaped it for the screen expect a few more. Far beyond debates over what has been cut and what stayed the movie triggers the age-old fissure between those who do and dont mind it when big-scale storytelling takes its time to play out.

The movies other virtue is Penelope Cruz as the town doctors daughter. As her fisherman fiance (Christian Bale) is off fighting the war she must temporarily share her house with Cages Corelli. Cruz is so passionate resisting then falling for her easygoing enemy that one wonders what happened to her in All the Pretty Horses. John Hurt is warm if not too Greek as Cruzs father but the British veteran is more convincing than Cage is tapping his Italian roots. And David Morrissey recalls a younger version of the ""good Nazi"" whom Curt Jurgens made a career of playing in postwar movies. Its the Germans heavy-handedness that alters the storys relatively harmonious Italian-Greek dynamics after Italy surrenders which turns what has been a tentative romance into a combat film. The result is far from perfect but to its many merits add timing. You never get a movie with this kind of story in mid-August when studios usually dump youth-audience dogs before the kids go back to school. Sometimes novelty value makes a movie seem better than it is but this one scrores points just for putting ""mandolin"" on a marquee.

CAPTAIN17-C-15AUG01-DD-HO Italian officer Antonio Corelli (Nicolas Cage) and Greek villager Pelagia (Penelope Cruz) find unexpected love during Italys World war II occupation of Greece. Photo HANDOUT Captain plays on emotions / Cage-Cruz tearjerker set on Greek island 1 / 1 Back to Gallery CAPTAIN CORELLIS MANDOLIN Drama. Starring Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz. Directed by John Madden. (R. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As wartime weepers go ""Captain Corellis Mandolin"" has a lot of pluck. In the romantic drama department it manages to outmaneuver the summers other love-in-the-ruins-of-battle movie ""Pearl Harbor."" This is thanks in large part to the presence of adroitly cast Penelope Cruz as a young villager on an occupied Greek island in World War II. Cruz delicate and strong at the same time plunges ahead and delivers her lines as if she intends to ignore how overblown they sometimes can be. Works for me. She could sing them they are operatic enough and it would fit right in. A surprisingly self-effacing Nicolas Cage plays a mandolin-toting Italian officer with a platoon of opera-singing troops in this drama of divided loyalties and shifting alliances. The Italians when they arent frolicking in their wet underwear in the sea and singing Verdis ""Anvil Chorus"" and such are part of an occupying force on the island that includes their sometime partners the Germans. Christian Bale as a Greek partisan completes the romantic triangle. The movie was directed by workmanlike John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") based on the 1994 novel by Louis de Bernieres. For all its flirting with hokeyness ""Captain Corellis Mandolin"" is bound to remind some viewers of 1996s ""The English Patient"" with Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas. People who enjoyed getting their tears jerked by that film are likely candidates to line up for this one. Maybe the best thing to do is just go with the flow. Even having her hair braided and wrapped across her head in the traditional style cannot make dewy-eyed heavy-lidded Cruz plain. She is Pelagia daughter of the local physician and a willing participant in a betrothal ceremony with her village beau Mandras (Bale). Radio reports of the mainland fighting interrupt the island idyll and Mandras goes off to fight. The Greeks have pushed back the Italians but Hitler will come to Mussolinis aid. The Italians eventually will surrender to the Allies in 1943 and the balance of power on the island will shift. Everyones paths cross on the island and they all -- Greeks Italians and Germans -- speak English with melting-pot accents that might be more likely in New York. At any rate Cages Italian accent as plucky Capt. Corelli does not make him a caricature. Cage not only plays the mandolin he also sings in a nice tenor a snippet of ""O mio babbino caro"" from Puccinis ""Gianni Schicci."" The Germans may heil Hitler but Corelli responds ""Heil Puccini."" A reluctant soldier who has never aimed a gun at anyone he is besotted by music and asks almost everyone he meets ""Do you sing?"" After Corelli plays with touching concentration a piece on the mandolin he tells Pelagia he wrote the song because he loves her. Those mandolin strings will later be put to far different use. Handsomely weathered John Hurt as Pelagias father gives a performance of such unhackneyed dignity that it provides a moral compass for the action and helps to keep the ricocheting emotional content of the film in balance. Upright and rock-steady Hurt cautioning Pelagia brings off through sheer force of personality a speech about the ""temporary madness"" of falling in love. Love itself he says ""is whats left over."" Even with the presence of Cruz the main attraction is the precariously gorgeous -- it is earthquake-prone -- Ionian island of Cephalonia where the story is set and the film was made. Anyone whose mind wanders can concentrate on the wonderful rustic house Pelagia and her father share and fantasize a Mediterranean retreat. Bale sometimes underrated always brings a unique penetration to anything he does. Here he is beefier than he was in ""American Psycho"" but cannot help making the inarticulate suitor Mandras telling even if he will come to look a bit too much like Che Guevara. Piero Maggio makes the small role of Corellis friend Carlo stand out when he takes charge and tells Pelagia he will look out for her. It turns out he will look out for Corelli too. During the final credits the current self-infatuated public television singing phenom Russell Watson audacious enough to set himself up as Pavarottis successor no less sings ""Ricordo Ancor"" also called ""Pelagias Song"" which I imagine well be hearing more of. By the time it arrives the movie has softened up most resistance. Advisory Contains graphic battle violence.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.
