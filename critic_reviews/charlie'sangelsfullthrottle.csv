"Charlies Angels three bodacious babes one awful director. Slate Sign In Sign Up Charlies Angels three bodacious babes one awful director. Charlies Angels three bodacious babes one awful director. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 27 2003 119 PM Fallen Angels Babes? Yes. Director? No. By David Edelstein Full camp It was an ominous sign when star and co-producer Drew Barrymore told the press that the first Charlies Angels picture (2000) was a seat-of-the-pants affair and that this time--in Charlies Angels Full Throttle (Columbia)--the filmmakers really knew what they were doing. I thought ""Oh shit."" I liked the first Charlies Angels --a wittily self-aware Hong Kong-style riff on the old brain-dead TV series. The movie was reportedly a shambles that needed to be thoroughly overhauled in post-production but I didnt mind its slapdash editing which seemed giddily in synch with its leading lady. Barrymore is a gifted comic actress but part of her charm comes from her amateurishness--from her slightly clumsy unsculpted body and her sibilant ""s."" The subtext of the film was Barrymores pipe dream ""Wouldnt it be a blast if someone like me could be a Charlies Angel?"" Advertisement The subtext of Charlies Angels Full Throttle is the punishing megalomania of its director who goes by the name of ""McG""--which could be short for ""Mecha-Godzilla."" McG is a lot more confident this time He wants to make sure you know hes in on the joke even if that means upstaging his own movie. So Full Throttle is full-throttle camp Its like a third-rate AustinPowers picture cut to the whacking attention-deficit-disorder tempo of Moulin Rouge (2001). McG turns every costume change into a rib-cracking nudge and he loves to zoom in on his actresses thighs and cleavage and butt cheeks. But he doesnt trust them to carry any scenes. He chops up their performances and throws in low-comic sound effects and jokey music cues. (When the Angels are drenched by a lawn sprinkler we get B.J. Thomas singing ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head."") The script has a fair amount of funny lines (including an in-joke in which an actor boasts that his latest big-budget action movie must be good--""It had 13 screenwriters"") but McG gives the gags no room to breathe. His jokes are like left hooks to the skull. You dont talk about actors in a movie like this you talk about victims. Chief among them alas is Barrymore who tries too frantically to signal that shes having a great time and who doesnt look so good either. (Shes acted off the screen by Jaclyn Smith whose face is so tight that its a wonder she can even open her mouth.) Hot on Barrymores tail is the new Bosley Bernie Mac who does an all-out minstrel-show turn I cant even bring myself to describe the performance--its in a different sphere of consciousness than his work on television and in movies like Oceans Eleven (2001). Lucy Liu is lucky to get the best lines and to play a handful of scenes with John Cleese as her father whos under the mistaken impression that Charlie is her pimp. If Cleese didnt script these bits himself they were written by someone who studied FawltyTowers and got the rhythms down cold The double-entendres are right on the button. Cameron Diaz is the movies thoroughbred Shes impossible for the camera to violate and her timing shines through in even millisecond bursts. One of the happiest things to happen to movies in the new millennium has been the absence of Demi Moore. Shes baa-ack. You have to admire Moore for going bod-to-bod with Diaz in a string bikini--and her bod looks fine more lithe than it did when she was a teenager. But her face is faintly wizened and her acting cheerless. The last time Moore looked like she was having any fun onscreen was St. Elmos Fire (1985) when she was still a throaty comedian with a touch of baby fat before she developed a steely obsession with selling herself as the Body Beautiful Featuring Hollywoods Most Capacious Tear Ducts. I figured at least she wouldnt cry in a Charlies Angels movie. But her character an ex-Angel has much pent-up resentment toward Charlie and the sound of John Forsythe over the speakerphone is simply too painful to bear. ... Next up for Moore Tosca on Gilligans Island. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

"The Angels Forced Fun washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen The Angels Forced Fun Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 27 2003 SO Charlies Angels -- that would be Natalie (Cameron Diaz) Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and Alex (Lucy Liu) -- are driving a military truck thats hauling a helicopter. Someone fires a missile at them from behind. Then a tank in front of them fires. Two missiles coming at them one fore and one aft. So they swerve the rig off a bridge. As they fall toward the water below the helicopter comes loose and all three Angels disentangle themselves climb into the helicopter and start that sucker up before they hit the surface. Thank goodness for slow motion. Not to mention gymnastic buffed bodies falling through the air. If this rocks your world then ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle"" is for you. But dont expect the giddy charm of the first film. The 2000 ""Charlies Angels"" had an invigorating liberating credo girl action figures should have the same fun as boys. But in ""Full Throttle"" that sense of fun is jackhammered into our skulls. The tongue that was so firmly in cheek last time has punctured through muscle and bone. The Angels are adorable okay and theyre not just having fun -- theyre having an over-the-top good time as they smile incessantly toss their heads back in laughter exchange high-fives and participate in a sort of extreme-sports version of a movie. There are costume changes and new high-kicks for every scene. The music is of course relentlessly loud and the use of ""Matrix""-style bullet-trajectory slow motion seems to have become required viewing in every action film. The plot? Apparently the FBI has been watching a few too many ""Lord of the Rings"" sequels. It seems that the entire software database of whistleblowers informers and former victims whose identities have been changed under the Witness Protection Program can be found within two rings. When both go missing its up to the Angels team to retrieve them. Their loopy mission brings them into contact with surfers motorcycle riders and recurrent sinister figure the Thin Man (Crispin Glover) who with his slick suit and center-hair parting suggests a demented banker from the 1940s. We also spend time with repeat suitors Pete (Luke Wilson) and Jason (Matt LeBlanc) who are suitably sweet and backgroundish. Bosley (Bill Murray) from the first film has gone to other better things. Hes replaced by a suddenly revealed brother amusingly played by Bernie Mac who could turn any throwaway character into someone memorable. The fine-tuned balance of zaniness and action has become a shriller question of franchise interests. Is co-producer and co-star Barrymore getting an equitable share of screen time with Diaz (who is obviously the crowd favorite of the three)? Can the physically retrofitted Demi Moore who plays a fallen Angel with treacherous ways bring in the older oglers? Should director Joseph McGinty Nichol or McG as hes called ratchet up the action tenfold or twentyfold? How many music videos can a man string end-to-end and call it a movie? And can Diazs character get any crazier? In this movie her blundering Ill-try-anything shtick is practically nuclear-driven. She could inspire a new psychotic condition called GOS giddy overdrive syndrome. The central theme is that despite everything the Angels have each other. But its hard to believe these one-dimensional beings have the human machinery to care about one another. They seem too busy competing for the biggest smile or the best line. ""Full Throttle"" is hardly the kind of movie to merit the slightest modicum of critical scrutiny. But if the Angels had a clue as to who they really were we might find them more compelling which would make the action cooler. But McG is too busy creating a pornography of self-reverential mayhem to care much about such matters. His eyes and hands are firmly on the throttle not the storyline. Obviously you can have fun with this kind of experience. Its just that youll be enjoying the military-industrial-complex version.

"Deviled Ham washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living >> Follow Style On Movies Deviled Ham Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday June 27 2003 You know youre in for a painful sit when the opening credits of ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle"" begin with ""A film by McG."" ""A film by Orson Welles"" okay. ""A film by Alfred Hitchcock"" by all means. But McG (nA(c) Joseph McGinty Nichol) whos made precisely one movie and whose biggest claim to fame before that was directing a Korn video? Well lets just say his arms are way too short to box with the cinematic gods. Nichols first movie of course was ""Charlies Angels"" an admittedly fun if birdbrained action comedy starring Drew Barrymore Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz. That first movie took the premise of the hit 1970s TV show -- three lissome lasses who solve crimes and kick major tushie in the process -- and ramped it up in velocity throw-weight and sexual heat. Although the first ""Charlies Angels"" movie was ostensibly about the subversive grrrl-power pleasures of watching three hotties get just as down and dirty as their male action-hero peers it was really about watching Diaz shake her groove thing in progressively skimpier outfits. Nichol in his infinite wisdom has taken that fundamental truth and stretched it into a nearly two-hour exercise in chaotic action and coarse annoyingly coy sexuality. Make no mistake ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle"" is Cameron Diazs movie. In any other instance this would be a good thing -- many observers note that as a blond bombshell with a knack for self-deprecation shes this eras answer to Carole Lombard. But the meat-headed ham-handed Nichol manages to make even Diaz almost unwatchable by the end of the movie. By then weve seen so many pratfalls impromptu dance-striptease numbers and fetishized shots of fanny-spanks and catfights that all sense of play of flirtation and seduction has been forcibly wrung out of them. To synopsize ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle"" would be to stipulate a plot of which there is nary. Put most simply super-spies Dylan (Barrymore) Alex (Liu) and Natalie (Diaz) have been assigned by their unseen boss Charlie (the voice of John Forsythe) to locate two titanium rings that hold the identities of people in the federal witness protection program. This will place Dylan in the path of an ex-lover a gangster with an Ed Grimley haircut named Seamus OGrady (Justin Theroux). It will introduce the girls to a legendary former Angel named Madison Lee (Demi Moore). And more important it will call for scads of costume changes in which Diaz plays respectively a Scandinavian tourist riding a mechanical yak a butch crime scene investigator a bikini-clad surfer chick a leather-clad biker chick a nun a welder a burlesque dancer and a bellhop. Had Nichol simply allowed Diaz and her co-stars to camp it up as cheerfully -- and beguilingly -- as they did in the first movie ""Full Throttle"" might have been an unobjectionable lightweight summer romp. Instead hes crammed the movie to bursting with fireballs chase scenes and slow-motion visual effects that were hackneyed by the time ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" stopped crouching and went into hiding. Presumably in an effort to bone up for his next directorial effort -- Mattels ""Hot Wheels"" movie I kid you not -- Nichol takes a particularly long and incoherent time with the chase scenes. The opening sequence of a narrow escape in northern Mongolia is a scattershot mess of trucks and tanks and planes (where did they come from?); later the Angels do time at an interminable motocross meet. These sequences plus showdowns at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles and the San Pedro shipyard culminate in a final Grand Guignol of trashy visuals slashing sound effects and a crypto-Sapphic encounter between Diaz and Moore that will no doubt immediately enter heavy rotation in adolescent male fantasies everywhere. Indeed kinky sexuality beats a near-constant tattoo throughout ""Full Throttle"" from crude puns and the predilections of the mysterious Thin Man (Crispin Glover) to the bump-and-grind antics of Diaz and Co. and the dominatrix chic of Moore (who it must be said proves that even after three kids and a 40th birthday she can still afford the best personal trainer on the planet). No doubt ""Charlies Angels"" co-producer Barrymore and her co-stars will insist that in winking at male fantasies and giving them such exaggerated life theyre not trafficking in Tamp;A as much as making fun of it. Maybe maybe not -- their teenage audience surely wont care. In fact with ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle"" that great auteur McG raises what may prove to be the defining question of his career When does an attempt at parody merely become an excuse to pander? Charlies Angels Full Throttle (111 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for action violence sensuality and language/innuendo.

Further lowering the seasons cinematic IQ is Charlies Angels Full Throttle. Full Throttle is all noise and no purr. AP Shot in grainy washed-out color and packed with all the bruises bullets and booty a hypocritical PG-13 rating allows the big screens second attempt to reconstitute Charlie cheese from the 70s TV show is a series of ho-hum production numbers musical pugilistic and one involving airborne dirt bikes. Review of the movie Charlies Angels Full Throttle ( out of four) Stars Cameron Diaz Drew Barrymore Lucy Liu Demi Moore Bernie Mac Justin Theroux Director Rob Reiner Distributor Columbia Rating PG-13 for action violence sensuality and language/innuendo Opens Friday nationwide In between is a nominal plot Someone has stolen the names of people being hidden by the federal witness protection program but here come Cameron Diaz Drew Barrymore Lucy Liu and a lot of wigs trying to track down the culprit. Despite having only one scene in the first 85 minutes 40-year-old Demi Moore poses the pre-release hypes central question Is Demi really back? And the answer As a fallen former Angel who becomes the movies dominant villain the actress unambiguously aces her bikini test. In a beach scene with Diaz Moore makes a persuasive claim that she can have any man she wants of any age from Methuselah to ET. She out-babes the leads. The rest recalls the lamest secret-agent spoofs of the late 60s after Matt Helm had gone flat. Not even Bernie Mac as work colleague Jimmy Bosley (literal brother of the first Angels Bill Murray character) is good for much fun in a listless lark so laden with skewed gene pools that John Cleese plays Lius father. Also around in lazily written roles of varying sizes are Bruce Willis (though not with Moore) Matt LeBlanc Terminator 2s Robert Patrick Carrie Fisher as a nun Crispin Glover acting (again) as if he has been bitten by Willards most rabid rat and in a jiffy cameo Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen. Listen up girls Take that obscene stash of cash youve made and apply it toward college so you wont be tempted to be Angels someday. There are only so many times you can see a slow-motion kickboxing scene or a figure sail off a skyscraper before you want to spend a nice cozy evening with the Dead Sea Scrolls. Hard-sell and impersonal the second Angels outing may be full throttle but its running on an empty tank.

Its not supposed to. / Its Charlies Angels. And Mick LaSalles glad hes not the target audience for this shameless sequel. 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Charlies Angels Full Throttle Action comedy. Starring Drew Barrymore Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu. Directed by McG. (PG-13. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its not just that the story of ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle"" is incoherent but that its meant to be. Its not just that the special effects look artificial but that theyre intended to be. And its not just that the jokes are witless but that they celebrate witlessness -- in a kind of ironic commentary on the notion of wit. Clearly this is something rare a movie that insulates itself against its own rottenness by being lousy by design. It should be dismissed out of hand if only for being irritating except that I have the nagging suspicion that theres some real communication going on here. Moreover I think its a communication designed to bypass me just as ""Flashdance"" bypassed middle-aged critics 20 years ago. If ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle"" is a strange land its the strange land of a new generation coming into awareness. Even the films splashy ineptitude is emblematic of modern youths attitude toward life -- cynical to the point of giddiness coarse to the point of exuberance and impatient. Jaclyn Smith Farrah Fawcett and Kate Jackson the original TV angels were cool customers compared with the new crew Drew Barrymore Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz who go through the movie giggling like junior high school girls. The reason is obvious. Theyre playing junior high school girls but in womens bodies. The latest ""Charlies Angels"" caters to the misconceptions of a generation of young girls. But maybe thats just an uncharitable way of saying it speaks to a generations fantasies. The angels are sexpots superheroes and sweeties. They have the nastiness (to outsiders) and the solidarity of an elite high school clique. They can leap as high as Hong Kong action stars and they can dazzle men -- clobbering them either with their fists or their sexuality. Maybe theres a feminist statement in all this but the most obvious one is that a womens action movie can be as loud and frenetic as any mans. The only worthy opponent for such amazing women could be another woman and in this case its Demi Moore as an ex-angel and Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist named Madison Lee. We first meet her on a beach flashing some of the whitest teeth since Johnny Carson and looking as distressingly gaunt as a Cinemascope body compressed to fit into a TV screen. Now we know what Moore has been doing in her long hiatus from films. Bleaching her teeth and working out. The director who calls himself McG begins ""Full Throttle"" with a full- blown action sequence that takes place somewhere with a lot of stuff happening -- its all too much its hard to remember. The women get out OK though because next thing we get is one of several obligatory sequences of Diaz dancing around the house wiggling her rear end. Diaz wiggles a lot in ""Full Throttle"" and its supposed to be either seductive or funny or both. Its embarrassing. Then the women impersonate forensic specialists. This is followed by -- theres no logical sense to this -- a chase on motorcycles done almost entirely through cheap-looking computer graphics. Thats the first 15 minutes. Enough plot please. In addition to Moore ""Full Throttle"" comes with an assortment of auxiliary villains the meanest of which is Justin Theroux as Seamus an Irish mafia boss who wants to take revenge on his former girlfriend Dylan (Barrymore) whose real name turns out to be Helen Zaas (say that three times.) Crispin Glover also reprises his role in the previous film as the Thin Man though his connection to the story is a mystery. After a frenetic first third ""Full Throttle"" slows down long enough to provide some amusing moments. The movie is enlivened with cameos by Bruce Willis (wearing a rug) Jaclyn Smith (looking great) and Eric Bogosian (playing a corpse). There are also references to Hammer ""Flashdance"" and Andy Gibb designed to appeal to a generation raised on the pop culture of three decades. Best of all in a minor role theres John Cleese as the father of Alex (Liu). Dad becomes convinced that his daughter has become a call girl and everything she says convinces him even more. Its just a minor part of ""Full Throttle"" but it may be indicative of something In this hyperactive modern comedy the funniest thing is a conceit straight out of 19th century farce. This film contains sexual situations and cartoon-like violence.

"CNN.com - Review Charlies Angels has the power - Jun. 27 2003 The Web CNN.com Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Overview | Gallery | Quiz Review Charlies Angels has the power No plot but who cares? By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Charlies Angels 21st century version Lucy Liu Drew Barymore and Cameron Diaz. Story Tools VIDEO At 40 Demi Moore returns to the spotlight in Charlies Angels Full Throttle. CNNs Janine Sharell reports. (June 27). PLAY VIDEO RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive (CNN) -- With Drew Barrymore co-producing and director McG once again back at the helm the sequel ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle"" soars to the same comedic heights reached by the original 2000 feature film (based on the TV show). And as the title implies this time around the Angels really push everything into high gear. Theres more action more stunts and of course theres Demi Moore too. The ""Ghost"" and ""Striptease"" star has chosen this film for her highly publicized return to an industry that she used to have tied around her little finger. Emerging from a self-imposed retirement the 40-year-old actress proves she can still hold her own -- even with some of the hottest actresses in town Barrymore Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu. Good thing shes looking so good. With this ""Charlies Angels"" franchise it seems that the skimpier the costumes the skimpier the plot. So lets just say the costumes are really really skimpy. But who cares about the story? The filmmakers certainly dont seem to be concerned in the least. In a nutshell -- and it fits perfectly -- the Angels are after two stolen rings engraved with encrypted information revealing the names of people in the governments Witness Protection Plan. One by one people are dying and Natalie (Diaz) Dylan (Barrymore) and Alex (Liu) are the only ones in the whole wide world who can stop the evil plan. Adding to the mix Cameron Diaz in familiar Angel surroundings in ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle."" In addition to Moore playing a fallen Angel named Madison there is one other new cast member -- Bernie Mac. Three years ago Bill Murray played the character of John Bosley the only connection between the Angels and their mysterious boss Charlie (again voiced by John Forsythe who did the same duty for the TV show). Due to reported creative differences Murray did not reprise the role and Mac has stepped in as Bosleys brother Jimmy. Yes I said brother. Let it go. As with the original the movie begins with a high-octane action scene. This time we find ourselves in a bar in Outer Mongolia where the Angels are undercover in order to rescue a captured federal agent in possession of one of the rings. With the music track blasting the action continues as the Angels kick dance wiggle giggle pout and kung-fu their way through one wild scene after another while tracking down the evil gangs in search of the rings. In the process of course they never break a sweat or a nail. Having a good time The Angels get involved in one wild escapade after another including Barrymores outing as a wrestler. This tongue-in-cheek different kind of ""chick flick"" confection never takes itself seriously as it whips its way through one ludicrous situation after another. The Angels go from dressing up in nun habits to stripping down to bikinis. Theyre awash in sequins or full body latex -- all without missing a beat. Barrymore Diaz and Liu were obviously having the time of their lives making this sequel. Theyve taken an old TV show and made a great franchise out of it. This is no mean feat when you consider all the horrible films that have taken that same recycled path from TV to the big screen. Somehow this movie manages to be sassy yet completely juvenile smart yet moronic and totally mindless all the way -- yet very entertaining. Thats not an easy trick. ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle"" is all about girl power and that powers still turned on.

Sweet spirited kick-ass action comedy will be a crowd-pleaser across the board and a turbo-charged money machine in all markets with its crowning achievement a keen appreciation for what both male and female viewers yearn to see. This review was corrected on June 26 2003. Bigger sleeker and better than the first sequel ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle"" is a joyride of a movie that takes the winning elements of the year 2000 hit to the next level. Sweet spirited kick-ass action comedy will be a crowd-pleaser across the board and a turbo-charged money machine in all markets with its crowning achievement a keen appreciation for what both male and female viewers yearn to see. Opening action is huge with Angels (Drew Barrymore Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu) infiltrating a roiling crowd of fur-suited barbarians in a Mongolian bar. Comic tone is set when Diaz takes a slo-mo sensual spin on a mechanical yak but before the titles unfurl the ladies have leapt through a sugar-glass window blown up an M-60 tank and flown though a canyon dangling from a helicopter. Plot provides at least a filament of logic with the angels in pursuit of a pair of rings that put together crack the code on the whereabouts of everyone in the federal witness protection program. Personal stakes come in when its revealed that Dylan (Barrymore) is herself in danger having blown the whistle in her secret past life on a killer (Justin Theroux) whos now coming after her. But storys merely a catch-all for the fun that ensues. Helmer McG returning from the original has a rare gift for making the action fresh clean and cohesive and pairing it with a party mix of pop cultural elements and a cross-generational wall-to-wall soundtrack that are spot on for todays cable-primed culture-savvy auds. At one point the girls are helping Natalie (Diaz) move in with her boyfriend (Luke Wilson) but distracted by an MC Hammer video playing in the living room they drop their packing boxes and dance together. Editing is so seamless as to make the action inevitable and a prime example of the playfulness and sisterhood at the heart of the movies appeal. Standout sequences include a sexy speedy motocross contest in which the high-flying bikers compete in a coal dump; and a bump-and-grind dance number that will ensure brisk sales around the world. Bruising fight scenes -- some built around martial arts and wirework -- kick the action into the hardcore arena but even then McGs talent for keeping it light and for churning out indelible movie images makes the violence exhilarating rather than numbing. Diaz whose salary soared to 20 million for the sequel flashes megawatt star power exuding lunatic charm and klutzy puppy dog lovability paired with a killer bod and a smile as wide as a highway billboard. But Barrymore as both co-star and producer also makes as big a contribution. Her up-from-nothing hip-bumping air-guitar playing Dylan is the movies sisterly soul and her guiding vision of the franchise as a place where male and female viewers can find equal satisfaction is its masterstroke. New chapter features the return to the screen of Demi Moore exuding steely intensity and strong fighting chops as a vengeful dark angel who goes bikini-to-bikini with Diaz in a beach scene -- and holds her own -- and the introduction of Bernie Mac suitably funny in a kookily conceived turn as the brother of the original Bosley (the absent Bill Murray). Adding interest are a slew of cameos including a chiseled Bruce Willis Eric Bogosian and OA (original angel) Jaclyn Smith. Production makes marvelous use of iconic Los Angeles locations from Griffith Observatory (not seen in cinema to this extent since ""Rebel Without a Cause"") to the Hermosa Beach strand to Musso amp; Frank Grill and is one a series of recent actioners (""The Italian Job"" ""Hollywood Homicide"") to film extensively on revitalized Hollywood Boulevard.
