But the roots of this upbeat if uneven debut from succesful US sketch comedians Jordan Key and Keegan-Michael Peele stretch a lot further back to the small-screen 70s when sitcom writers took pleasure in picking apart macho stereotypes and social snobbery. Imagine The Likely Lads with weed jokes and youre most of the way there. Rell (Peele) and Clarence (Key) are suburban middle-class guys stewing in their respective traps. Rell is recently dumped and mourning while Clarences loving but complicated marriage is making him question his manhood. When Rell adopts runaway kitten Keanu his life snaps into focus - until said feline is catnapped for reasons too complex to go into by drug baron Cheddar (Method Man) and his tooled-up cronies. Can our not-exactly-street-savvy heroes win him back? When it sticks to character comedy Keanu is glorious the unabashed affection between its writer-stars is infectious and the script is loaded with great gags some of them disarmingly sweet (training consultant Clarences efforts to bond a group of perplexed drug dealers) some flat-out crude (a visit to a strip club called Hot Party Vixens with the acronym in flashing red neon). But as the plot thickens things start to wobble. That all this mayhem is sparked by the hunt for an adorable kitty is charming but its not enough to overcome a general sense of familiarity as the bullets fly and the car chases kick in. It doesnt help that the women get sidelined Tiffany Haddishs tomboy bruiser Hi-C starts out tough as nails and ends up stuck in love-interest limbo. Its ironic but Keanu might be a better movie if it was more like TV 90 plotless minutes of Key and Peele just goofing around on the mean streets mightve been something really special.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Its easy to think based on the marketing that the first feature film from acclaimed comedy duo Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele will be 100 minutes of an adorable kitten dressed in a do-rag and gold chain for easy laughs but Keanu is so so much more than that. And also not.Through every minute of Keanu its evident were watching a movie made by people who love movies. They know all the cliches of action films and rom-coms but they also circumvent them. Its as if they read Blake Snyders Hollywood screenwriting bible Save the Cat -- which advises you to give audiences what they want and among other things literally save the cat if theres one in peril in your story -- and then made an entire movie around the cat. The felines name even seems like a wink at a film with some uncanny parallels to this one Keanu Reeves electric murdered-pet revenge flick John Wick.Film Details Keanu RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time100 min. More Info Trailer In the very first scene we get our trailer-promised slow-motion shots of a kitten soon to be named Keanu dashing through total carnage as two goons who look like the Crow meets Blade shoot up a drug den employing Matrix-level moves to flip upside down while firing guns. The goons -- or the ""Allentown boys"" (also played by a heavily made-up Key and Peele) -- obviously fall in love with the wide-eyed kitten who melts their hearts until the police burst in and ruin the fun. From there the kitten traverses the city to end up on the doorstep of Rell (Peele). And so begins our story of a cat who steals hearts and leads humans into terrible situations to save him. We could really stop right there and it would be funny enough but to their credit Key and Peele never settle for just the easy joke. The duo has honed a beautiful comic partnership over the course of their Comedy Central series a kind of odd-couple friendship that feels more influenced by Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder than any contemporary performers. Both are biracial and this status informs how their characters deal with race and class like when Rell bumps N.W.As ""Fuck tha Police"" in his cousin Clarences (Key) minivan and a cop pulls up prompting Rell to turn down the music smile and wave. The cops drive off and Rell fronts ""Roll on po-po"" a ridiculous statement that Clarence does not let go. Their characters constantly bounce their racial and gender insecurities at each other. Are they black enough? Are they manly enough? EXPAND What bad guy wouldnt fall in love with this cat? Courtesy of Warner Bros. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm When they end up at the strip-club HQ of the Blips (the gang that took over for the Bloods and Crips) to find their stolen cat theyre in the lions den of what they fear theyre not the ""blackest"" and most manly of men. These are guys -- and one woman Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish) -- who use the N-word as if its a conjunction and nothing could make Rell and Clarence more uncomfortable. Watching the heroes squirm while strippers gyrate on the poles is absolutely joyous because for once we get to see two guys onscreen who are actually genuinely conflicted about their roles as men in this scenario. It only gets more cringe-comic when the two are mistaken for those Allentown toughs and have to role-play as cold-blooded assassins to infiltrate the Blips and rescue Keanu from their leader ""Cheddar"" (Method Man).One of the funniest moments comes from a long scene with Anna Faris playing a drug-addicted samurai sword-wielding version of herself. Rell has to sell her a new super-drug and endure her psychopathic desire to see a man die. Meanwhile Clarence oblivious hangs out in Faris driveway in his minivan with the rest of the Blips -- Trunk Stitches and Bud -- teaching them of the glory of George Michael until they all break out in song proclaiming their love for their new ""father figure.""Key and Peele somehow infuse an emotional reality into this scene and others despite how absurd the premise sounds. In Hollywood movies a hapless hero forced into a situation where he has to kill someone would just do it and wed never think twice about the body count. But Clarence and Rell react as regular humans do scared as shit. Key and Peele never resort to turning their characters into despicable people for a laugh. Maybe I sound like an old woman even thinking this but its damn refreshing to see nice characters in an American comedy again.That brings us to the mind-bogglingly adorable feline. Whoever trained the seven cats that collectively play Keanu deserves an Academy Award. Sure anyone can film a cat and America will love it but director Peter Atencio elevates cat videos to an art form with gorgeous slow-motion tracking shots surrounded by explosions that would make Michael Bay proud. Key and Peele have a special kind of magic theyve brought to their first feature but its also a crazy-simple formula Keep saving that damn cat.

Entertainment The Key and Peele movie Keanu poses a question for brainy cult figures who want to make slapstick action comedies for the multiplex Do they have the courage of their deadpan? The parodies that make up TVs Key and Peele are outlandish but theyre played more or less straight-faced and the seemingly meandering conversations that break them up are buoyed by the stars deliciously tricky rhythms. You need a special kind of pacing for comedy like that -- the kind that gives studios the heebie-jeebies which get passed on to tyro filmmakers. The upshot is a business littered with the bones of cult comics who tried to make mainstream movies and lost their distinctive pulse. Keanu is cause for hope. In my frequent role as ""laugh accountant"" for mainstream comedies Id estimate two-thirds of it works and when its good its sooooo good -- good enough to make you want to see Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key and director Peter Atencio and co-writer Alex Rubens do it again and go farther out. Here they begin with a classic premise for movie clowns Two distinctly un-macho guys are forced to impersonate manly men of action. In this case the pair have to play two frightening hooded assassins (also played by Key and Peele) known as the Allentown Brothers. Early in the ruse Rell (Peele) advises Clarence (Key) to try not to sound like Richard Pryors legendary reedy tremulous impression of a white man which leads to one of the duos favorite dichotomies black men acting a little too insecure effeminate stereotypically ""white"" versus black men acting a little too alpha cocky and stereotypically ""black."" What kicks off Keanu is a ""feminine"" idea Rell -- having just lost a woman -- develops a deep love for a fiendishly cute kitten that shows up on his doorstep and that he names ""Keanu"" because he thinks its Hawaiian for peace. When Cheddar (Method Man) leader of the gang the Blips (rejects from the Bloods and Crips) mistakes Rells house for one belonging to the stoner dealer (Will Forte) next door the drug lord makes off with the cat -- which he names ""New Jack."" (The cat is also beloved by a Hispanic gang which calls it ""Iglesias."") To retrieve the cat our heroes infiltrate the Blips under the names Tectonic and Shark Tank. They use the N-word liberally if not always artfully. Their bizarre comebacks spin your head ""Who the fuck are you?"" ""Who the fuck arent we?"" For Rell the cat is all but Clarence has a larger goal to develop a persona that will appeal to his wife Hannah (Nia Long) whos off on a trip with the couples daughter the daughters friend and the friends father -- a white man (Rob Huebel) with clear designs on Hannah. The stereotypes here are not especially innovative but Key and Peele are a scream when their sensitive natures keep overriding their attempts at fitting in with the gang members. Its a fabulous gag when Clarence -- forced to ride along with the menacing gang -- asks each to introduce and say two things about him- or herself and funnier yet when the members go along with it and prove rather sweet. There is one sublime extended centerpiece which cuts between Rell and the surlier-than-the-male female Hi-C (Tiffany Hadish) as they make a drug delivery to a Hollywood mansion and Clarence in the car with the others attempting to account for why hes got so much George Michael music. (""He had no positive role model in his life."") The ever-treasurable Anna Faris (as herself) is the owner of the mansion. Shes glittery-eyed and manic and the scene builds inextricably to carnage -- it could be a Tarantino parody. And the George Michael inserts take the sequence to another level. The more formula parts of Keanu frankly stink. The climax is a shoot-out and car chase that the director doesnt know how to stage and edit. Worse its a grim reminder that Key and Peele have presumably had to pander to their presumed audience to get the movie made. Everything thats good in the movie slows down or distends or interrupts the dumb plot. Everything that drags it down is for the sake of pepping it up. Two-thirds though not bad for a first feature. And a mad-cute kitten. Help it make some money this weekend so they can all do it again.

Does this wild idea work? It does--just maybe not in the way you expect it to Key and Peele the duo of Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are best known and loved--for the Comedy Central sketch show bearing their name which ran from 2012 to 2015. These small bits were blissful mini-works of casual genius In the days when our current president seemed too reluctant to stand up to Congress Key created and played Luther Obamas ""anger translator"" who stood on the sidelines spewing all the things the Commander-in-Chief just couldnt bring himself to say. Then there was the ""East/West College Bowl"" pregame routine in which the two played an assortment of fake college football stars introducing themselves on-camera with increasingly outlandish made-up names (Jackmerius Tacktheritrix Davoin Shower-Handel Swirvithan LGoodling-Splatt). The routine wasnt just an example of masterful wordplay; it worked because Key and Peele created a mini-personality for each player. Some were street some were so soft-spoken they might be addressing their grandmas. Some would face the camera with a glassy-eyed stare as if the lens were a robber of souls. A few betrayed an obvious lisp. The gag was as intricate as an infinitesimal set of Russian nesting dolls. If these guys were all stereotypes there were so many variations that you could hardly stereotype them. That was the heart of the joke and the brilliance of it. But Key and Peele obviously masters of sketch comedy havent headlined a movie together until now. In Keanu they play cousins who tangle with a fake Los Angeles street gang (theyre called the 17th Street Blips) as they search for a missing kitten. Does this wild idea work? It does--just maybe not in the way you expect it to. The movies rhythms take some getting used to--it feels strange to adjust to the idea of Key and Peele playing essentially only one character apiece for a stretch of some 90 minutes. Peele is Rell Williams the kittens owner Hes just broken up with his girlfriend when this tiny tabby charmer shows up at his door. ""Oh--can I help you?"" he says in response to the small aliens mewed greeting. (Peeles timing in this moment may be the most perfect thing in the movie.) Key plays Rells cousin Clarence a straight-arrow guy whose wife (Nia Long) has gone away for the weekend instructing him to loosen up for a change. He and Rell start with a trip to the multiplex ""That was the best Liam Neeson movie I have ever seen"" But Rells kitten--whom hes named Keanu because its possibly the best cat name ever--is a cat with a past. And because he is so amazingly cute everybody wants him and so he gets cat-napped. Clarence and Rell trace his whereabouts to the lair of Cheddar the grand fromage of the 17th Street Blips (hes played with faux-somber menace by Method Man). To ingratiate themselves with Cheddar and get the kitten back the two turn gangsta They adopt dumb fake names (Rell is Tectonic Clarence is Shark Tank) and they work hard to fit in because they have to. The other members among them Bud (Jason Mitchell the superb actor who played Eazy-E in Straight Outta Compton) and Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish) would knife them soon as look at them. And so Clarence and Rell become people who are figuring out how to fit in. Clarence even though hes big on enunciation and given to wearing trim plaid shirts and light-colored pants slips into gang life with ease He has a marvelous sequence in which he tries to sell his new friends on the merits of George Michael. Rell dressed in a pastel aqua hoodie and with a face that radiates placid cherubic innocence has a harder time of it. When he talks tough he gets the words right; its the inflections that are all off. He may as well be speaking a Martian language. Its funny at first. Then it isnt. And then somehow its funny again. The pleasures of Keanu (which was written by Peele and Axel Rubens and directed by Peter Atencio who also directed the Key and Peele Show) are different from those of the sketch routines. Key and Peele hilarious as they are are subtle performers not raucous ones. And at certain points the movie temporarily loses steam. Maybe its because you unconsciously expect them to shift into other personas and theyre stuck in the same ones for the span of the movie. But once you settle into Keanu it works. And in many ways its of a piece with everything else Key and Peele have done. When youre a person of color in this country everyone else it seems gets to decide who and what you are. Rell and Clarence know who they are. But in their mission to reclaim a kitten of all things they have to play at being stereotypes--and even then their individuality is defiant. Without even trying Key and Peele tease out the connections and distinctions between racial identity and personal identity. Sometimes the two are the same and sometimes they couldnt have less to do with one another--when youre busy just doing the work of being a human being how do you even know where one leaves off and the other begins? Key and Peele are about (among many other things) the impossibility and the foolishness of making hard-and-fast rules. Keanu does have one flaw Not enough kitten. The captivating smidgen of fur appears only occasionally at one point wearing a tiny do-rag and a mini gold medallion. Otherwise he is naked as he should be. Actually it took seven tabbies to play Keanu which means Key and Peele were far outnumbered by cat performers. Still they hold their own. Theyre movie stars now and sometimes that means being cool with letting another cat steal the scene. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

If it werent the whole endeavor would have fallen apart in the opening scene where an underground drug operation is raided by two merciless gangsters and an adorable tabby kitten the titular hero pops its head out of a pile of dollar bills and makes a break for freedom. Keanu is the first feature film starring the comedy duo Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele who electrified the sketch-comedy genre with their show Key amp; Peele. While they certainly lend to the movies overall charm the whole violent loony caper wouldnt make a bit of sense--nor would it be nearly as delightful--without the darn cat. Related Story Key amp; Peele and Hannibal Buress Highlight Comedy Centrals Evolution Perhaps in an homage to the mercurial Hollywood icon its named after Keanu is a zany comic take on the Keanu Reeves-starring John Wick only this time all the gangsters are doing battle over a kitten instead of a photogenic beagle. Its also a take on the phenomenon of ""code switching"" digging into Hollywoods one-dimensional take on African American masculinity with occasional sharpness as two nerdy protagonists are drawn into a world of gun-toting and drug-dealing stereotypes and struggle to blend in. It has all the hallmarks of a classic Key amp; Peele sketch which in the end is its undoing; even with a 98-minute running time the premise just cant sustain a madcap full-length effort. But the charm of its stars--and their furry on-screen partner--is enough to at least keep things entertaining as the film delivers a sharp spoof of Hollywoods often empty-headed blockbuster tendencies.Keanu begins with the aforementioned shoot-out which introduces the kitten as an L.A. drug lords pet who seems to long for a simpler life. How else to explain Keanus mad bolt for freedom at the beginning of the movie into a gentler suburb where he runs into Rell (Peele) a nerdy stoner recovering from a break-up. The two hit it off but the film unfortunately fast-forwards through their bonding to the moment of Keanus kidnapping by a rival gang which draws Rell and his straight-laced pal Clarence (Key) into an intricate web of mistaken identities and cartoonish violence. Keanu is that obscure object of desire hunted by the cartel he escaped prized by Cheddar (Method Man) the gangster who kidnapped him and pursued by two anonymous assassins (also played by Key and Peele) who get drawn into the comedy of errors. Its implied (but never explained) that the cats primary value to everyone involved is its cuteness--a hilariously simple and effective device that allows Rell and Clarence to infiltrate a world they dont understand.Rell and Clarence bear some physical similarity to the two assassins cutting a bloody swathe through town which is enough to grant them entry to Cheddars gang. With that the genre spoofery begins--Keanu is a light-hearted parody of a slew of L.A. gang movies like New Jack City and Boyz n the Hood while incorporating Key and Peeles own brand of subversion. Clarence a happily married business consultant who blares George Michael in his Honda minivan taps into some buried font of stereotypical masculine posturing and is exhilarated. The films best side-plot which could have done with more exploration sees him gleefully teaching Cheddars gang about team-building skills and delighting in their improvements during a climactic shootout (""Theyre communicating"" he yelps with glee).Keanu has all the hallmarks of a classic Key amp; Peele sketch which in the end is its undoing.Rell is exposed to the nastier side of gang life as he tries to win the respect of Cheddars lieutenant Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish) which is where the film tends to drag. Haddish a comedian who also appears on NBCs brilliant Carmichael Show is Keanus most luminous human star but shes too often pushed into a dull enforcer mode as things get darker and more violent and Rell and Clarence struggle to keep up. The mistaken-identity trope gets old quickly--Key and Peeles ""gangster"" personae are worth some laughs in the first 20 minutes of the film but are too flimsy to drive Keanus overly complex plot. After an hour its hard to believe that anyone would buy these guys as hardened assassins even in such a heightened comedy.Keanus core premise is a sharp one that even though the gangster facades Clarence and Rell slip into are silly and reductive theres something appealing in their simplicity and in the bloody mayhem that ensues. Anytime viewers are enjoying the films high-octane action excess (competently directed by Key and Peeles TV collaborator Peter Atencio) then the joke is on them. When Keanu seems like its pandering to the lowest common denominator one recalls a spate of purportedly serious action dramas that do the same with zero self-awareness. The joke wears out sooner than it should but the stars of Keanu (including yes that terrific cat) do a decent job distracting from that.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Movie Quiz Pittsburgher movie quiz for yunz Is Birdman star Michael Keaton the best actor with western Pennsylvania ties? Click here to play the Tribs tongue-in-cheek attempt to find out. If you watched the trailer for ""Keanu"" -- starring Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key of Comedy Centrals beloved series ""Key amp; Peele"" -- and wondered ""is this a real movie?"" youre not alone. Its understandable as most know ""Key amp; Peele"" as a veritable factory of genre-bending viral sketches that engage with the tropes of Hollywood. But yes ""Keanu"" is a real movie a real funny one at that. Its also understandable if you might have assumed that ""Keanu"" was a parody of the Keanu Reeves actioner ""John Wick"" since the stories of both films revolve around missing pets and the owners who will do anything for them. But no ""Keanu"" was in the works before ""John Wick"" came out so that connection is simply a happy accident. Directed by Peter Atencio ""Keanu"" allows Key and Peele to take their specific brand of humorous cultural commentary and blow up the scale from the small screen to the big. Peele plays Rell a hipster stoner and artist in L.A. suffering from a bad breakup. When a wayward kitten finds its way to his doorstep Rell learns to love again naming the feline Keanu. His cousin Clarence (Key) is a dorky corporate communications executive whose wife (Nia Long) wants him to learn how to relax. During a bachelor weekend Rell and Clarence return from a ""Liam Neesons"" movie to discover that Rells place has been burgled and Keanu is missing. With intel from his pot dealer-neighbor Hulka (Will Forte) the two set off on an epic cat repossession adventure getting mixed up in the drug dealing Blip gang lead by the intimidating Cheddar (Method Man). Much of the humor is centered around the cultural code-switching that Key and Peele are so adept in mining for humor. Their characters are two sort of lame dorky guys who feel the need to act hard and posture when they are thrust into this situation as a self-defense mechanism. As biracial men Key and Peele have always been uniquely poised to explore the gray areas of the performance and presentation of racial and cultural identity and ""Keanu"" is no exception. They happily skewer the stereotypes of gangster culture especially with an extended gag involving the music of George Michael. At the same time the film presents the gangster life as an opportunity for hedonistic liberation from repression and constraint with appropriate consequences of course. At the center of this wild violent melee between warring drug gangs and assassins is Keanu the kitty so cute that it seems absolutely worth all the trouble. Seven kittens were used to portray Keanu and the performances of the animals are quite remarkable. ""Keanu"" is hilarious in the way you might expect from Key and Peele but on a much larger and more grandiose level -- the jokes hit harder and the scenarios are more outlandish resulting in a legitimately epic action comedy that is at once a send up and love letter to the genre.

The pacing of a comedy sketch or even a half-hour sitcom isnt enough to hold a movie audiences attention for 90 minutes so even if the jokes are great the downtime between them has to engage as well. Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele stars of Comedy Centrals ""Key amp; Peele"" havent quite licked the downtime problem in their first joint big screen outing ""Keanu"" but when the laughs come they are hearty and frequent. This crime comedy doesnt consistently deliver but the highs make the lows worth enduring. Also Read Kitten Comedy Keanu Purrs to 560000 at Thursday Box Office Much of the humor on ""Key amp; Peele"" derives from the two comedians performance of masculinity and of a specific kind of blackness; their persona is two nerdy soft-spoken guys who will when necessary puff up their chests and deepen their voice to play-act at he-man brutishness and cold-eyed gangster swagger. The performance itself finds the humor in these stereotypes and the fact that Key and Peeles nebbishes inevitably overdo the act makes it all even funnier. That gag sets up the premise for ""Keanu"" The titular adorable kitty runs away from its owner a drug cartel kingpin who gets shot in the first five minutes and makes its way to the apartment of Rell (Peele who co-wrote with Alex Rubens a vet of the TV show). Rells been in the dumps since his last girlfriend ditched him but the appearance of Keanu has given him a new passion for living. Rells uptight cousin Clarence (Key) is on his own for a few days while wife Hannah (Nia Long) is on a weekend trip with their daughter and the two have a boys night out at a Liam Neeson movie. (Fans of the show know how these two will inevitably pronounce the actors name.) When they return home they discover Rells place has been broken into and Keanu has been stolen. Rells dealer Hulka (Will Forte) -- speaking of performances of blackness -- points them in the direction of Cheddar (Method Man) leader of the ""Blips"" (a joint venture of the Bloods and the Crips). Also Read The Story Behind Key and Peeles Keanu How the Kitten Got Its Name Cheddar of course has been entranced by Keanu as well and Rell and Clarence must pretend to be hard thugs the ones who killed the cartel guy to get their cat back. Along the way they teach Cheddars street team including Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish ""The Carmichael Show"") a few things about teamwork (Clarence is a corporate trainer) and about the power of George Michaels music. The two leads completely understand these characters and where to find the gags -- Clarence turns on a dime from refusing to say the n-word to not being able to stop saying it -- and the grandly violent set pieces are a clever parody of action-movie tropes. But since ""Key amp; Peele"" so brilliantly copied the look and feel of so many film genres (and director Peter Atencio is credited with 54 episodes of the show) its a surprise that ""Keanu"" is shot so poorly so often its exteriors hazy while the interiors are overcluttered. When the film isnt directly commenting on action movies it has no look of its own on which to fall back. Also Read Jungle Book Set to Roar Past Keanu Mothers Day for 3rd Weekend Win And while there are amusing ideas interwoven throughout (Cheddar headquarters at a strip club called Hot Party Vixens the unfortunate acronym of which is plastered everywhere) the pacing is frequently slack leading to too many sections of the film where the air gets sucked out of the room while we wait for the next big comedic explosion. Still Key and Peele are such gifted performers with such provocative things to say about race and gender that ""Keanu"" merits a look. Now that they have their ""Take the Money and Run"" out of their system they may well have an ""Annie Hall"" in their future.

Now theyre taking their partnership to the big screen with the occasionally sloppy but frequently hilarious Keanu starring alongside one very tiny but very charismatic kitten. Longtime Kamp;P writer Alex Rubens penned the film with Peele who stars as Rell a heartbroken stoner wallowing in his own misery after being ditched by his girlfriend. His savior appears in the form of a life-changingly adorable kitten who he dubs ""Keanu."" ""I think it means cool breeze in Hawaiian"" he tells his cousin Clarence (Key). Unfortunately Rell and Keanus happiness is short-lived as a group of notorious drug dealers known as the Blips (the guys who got kicked out of the Bloods and the Crips) break into Rells house and catnap poor Keanu. As a result the decidedly suburban Rell and Clarence pose as a pair of bloodthirsty thugs to infiltrate the Blips and steal back their fuzzy friend. In some ways Keanu feels like a special extended episode of Key and Peele. There are the relentless pop culture references (George Michaels music plays a big role) the commentaries on black masculinity and code-switching and even a few callbacks to specific Kamp;P sketches. (Before all the murder and mayhem Rell and Clarence head to the movies to see ""Liam Neesons"" in Substitute Teacher referencing two of Key and Peeles most popular sketches and the duos enduring love of the Taken star.) Peter Atencio who directed nearly every episode of Key and Peele makes his feature directorial debut with Keanu and although the films bigger budget means a few more explosions and slow-mo shootouts it doesnt look all that different from the highly stylized and cinematic Kamp;P. Thanks to Key and Peeles top-notch comedic chemistry the jokes are more hit than miss including a psychotic cameo by a female star and a trippy self-referential voiceover by Keanu Reeves himself. Less innovative is Keanus predictable storyline which meanders and gets lost in unnecessary subplots. What made Key and Peele the TV show so brilliant was how it felt like nothing else on television. Keanu has its clever (and adorable) premise but the rest feels like your standard action-comedy and even at one hour and 38 minutes things start to drag towards the finish line (especially when Keanu himself isnt on screen). Even if it cant compete with the best highlights from their TV show Keanu is a solid first step into movie stardom for both Key and Peele. But the true breakout stars are the seven fluffy kittens who played the movies namesake. There may not be an Academy Award for Best Supporting Feline Actor but if there was the Oscar would most definitely go to Keanu.

A suburban dad (Keegan-Michael Key) and his slacker friend (Jordan Peele) go undercover as gangsters in an effort to recover the slackers new kitten. (It seeks him out after escaping a slo-mo drug massacre in a church presumably because it can sense his heartbreak over a recent breakup.) And what do you know a little street does em both some good Dad learns to unwind and assert and slacker finds drive and purpose. Indeed the ease with which they adopt their new identities as Sharktank and Tectonic is almost enough to make you wonder if the other stuff -- the boring nonviolent stuff -- wasnt the real put-on. Itd sure help to explain why the pairs horror when shit gets real seems so fake and why theyre so good at being badass. The unfortunate result however is the devolution from bold-ish black-on-black comedy to plain old action-comedy. Theres pleasure in the easy rapport between the leads but as events take their course its a good thing that cat is cute.

Yeah maybe. But I laughed my ass off. First of all the cat is effing adorable. And Key and Peele score big whenever director Peter Atencio and screenwriters Peele and Alex Rubens stop piling on the action-flick cliches. The pair play middle-class cousins in suburban Los Angeles. Key is Clarence a husband and father. Peele is Rell who needs comforting when his gf dumps his sorry weed-smoking ass. Thats when a kitty shows up on his doorstep. Its instant love. Rell a John Wick superfan calls him Keanu. He even makes a Keanu calendar by photoshopping the feline into scenes from such fave films as Fargo The Shining Crimson Tide and Point Break.

Hes just escaped from a drug deal gone wrong - great scary bloody funny scene. And now hes fallen into the clutches of a gangbanger named Cheddar (Method Man) who puts Keanu in a do-rag and names him New Jack. To get Keanu back Rell and Clarence are forced to help Cheddar pull off a certain-death job with his crew the 17th Street Blips (a combo of Bloods and Crips). That means the two wussies need to start acting gangsta taking street names and making deals for a new drug called ""Holy Shit"" which Cheddar says makes you feel like ""youre smokin crack with God."" Clearly something was being smoked during the making of this movie. Im not complaining. You might notice that Keanu doesnt figure in every scene. Big mistake. The cat is a playa. But so are Key and Peele and its a kick to see them get laughs out of everything gangsta. ""You sound like Richard Pryor doing an impression of a white guy"" Rell tells Clarence. Snap. And even when the laughs dont always snap Key and Peele are ready with another one or a dozen that do. These dudes really are the cats meow.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 29 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 29 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Peter Atencio Written by Jordan Peele and Alex Rubens Starring Jordan Peele Keegan-Michael Key and seven very cute kittens Classification 14A Country USA Language English How do you mock something while simultaneously celebrating it? That was the dilemma Edgar Wright faced when making 2007s Hot Fuzz a riff of the over-the-top theatrics of buddy cop movies that was itself an over-the-top buddy cop movie. Because Wright is one of the most skilled and savvy filmmakers working today he was able to both satirize the genres flaws - the needless explosions The whiplash-inducing cuts The fetishization of guns so large theres no question as to what theyre compensating for - and embrace them creating a fully aware comedy that was as sly as it was stupid. Its not a trick that every filmmaker is able to pull off quite so easily a fact Peter Atencio surely must have realized while making his feature debut with Keanu. The comedy eagerly wants to both ape and admire another narrowish genre - the dumb and fun urban crime thriller familiar to fans of New Jack City Training Day and True Romance. But Atencio can never quite balance his competing desires to poke fun at the genre and reinvent its cliches. Normally this would be a fatal flaw but lucky for Atencio Keanu has him working with two of the most innovative comedians of their generation Jordan Peele and Keegan-Michael Key.Best known for their frequently brilliant if now concluded sketch-comedy series Key amp; Peele the two performers save Keanu from the depths of genre overkill. Which is a bit odd as Atencio also served as the director for all 54 episodes of the pairs Comedy Central show playing an undeniably huge part in its success. But no matter Any of Atencios directorial missteps are greatly overshadowed by the easy charm and wit of his leading men who find themselves revisiting and fine-tuning familiar Key amp; Peele themes of racial stereotyping and toxic masculinity to hilarious effect.The plot is threadbare but cutely disarming in its own way. While enduring the aftermath of a breakup Rell (Peele) discovers an impossibly cute kitten on his doorstep which he names Keanu. It turns out though that the cat was once the prized possession of a local drug dealer and the pet quickly ends up in the hands of a rival. Enter Rells strait-laced George Michael-listening cousin Clarence (Key) who reluctantly agrees to help rescue the furball. (Its worth noting that while Keanu isnt necessarily named after the Matrix star Reeves references abound - and its no coincidence that the actors 2014 film John Wick was about one mans violent quest to hunt down those responsible for harming his puppy.)Theres not much more you need to know about the story save that it affords Key and Peele the opportunity to endlessly spoof black culture or rather what Hollywood imagines black culture to be a crass world filled with tattooed thugs and so many utterances of the N-word that even Quentin Tarantino would blush. But this is not broad comedy - Key and Peele are sharp comic actors and know exactly how to prick and push an audience into a realm of delightful discomfort.They also know how to be generous co-stars with Peeles gruff assertiveness toned down just enough to bounce off Keys prickly neuroticism. Its the type of easy chemistry you would expect from performers whove been working together for years (including an undernoticed stint on MADtv) but its delightfully surprising to encounter all the same. As is several casting surprises sprinkled throughout the rest of the film including one cameo that takes a quietly brilliant meta turn halfway through.Theres no question Keanu could have been more - an outrageous ode to outrageousness rather than a splattered love letter to action tropes. But just when you think Keanu should be put to sleep all three of its stars (nine if you count all seven cats who play the title character) remind you that good things can come in messy packages.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Keegan-Michael Key a beanstalk of nervous energy and Jordan Peele stockier and smoother fit the profile of a classic comedy duo; they earn plenty of laughs just standing side by side. But theyre also sketch-comedy chameleons meaning that they rarely settle into a static dynamic. On their brilliant now-defunct variety show Key amp; Peele the two would take turns playing foil for each other like actors in a two-man stage show swapping parts night to night. Keanu their first big-screen starring vehicle finds a way to preserve that role-playing component Key and Peele appear as ordinary buttoned-up dudes forced to masquerade as cold-blooded badasses--a premise that allows both to be cutups and straight men to go wildly over the top and fish-out-of-water reactive all depending on the scene. The film is a one-joke comedy but the joke is decent and it helps that the actors know how to deliver it.Okay theres a second joke too and it involves a cat so adorable that even the most hardened career criminals would risk their empires to hold onto it. Narrowly escaping the bloodbath of the opening scene--the culprits are the aforementioned badasses two silent assassin bogeymen--a mewling grey kitten ends up on the doorstep of recently dumped stoner artist Rell (Peele) who instantaneously bonds with the animal. When someone catnaps Keanu as his new owner names him Rell and his uptight family-man cousin Clarence (Key) go poking around on the wrong side of Los Angeles eventually stumbling into the strip-club HQ of gangster Cheddar (Method Man). Its here that Rell and Clarence are confused for their doppelgangers--both played naturally by Key and Peele--and haphazardly rechristen themselves Tectonic and Shark Tank adopting alter egos to find the cat.Keanu builds most of its gags around this mistaken-identity plot in which two normal nerds try to walk talk and behave like streetwise killers. Its a grand bluff and the stars have a lot of fun with the charade especially during the scene where Rell and Clarence blatantly suppress their panic-attack relief after surviving their first meeting with Cheddar. The pair are so consistently funny bullshitting their way through every situation that its sometimes possible to ignore how thin the movie around them really is. A scenario is much harder to sustain for 90 minutes than for three and the script--written by Peele and Alex Rubens--often betrays the sketch-comedy background of the stars. Some gags get repeated ad nauseam like Clarences undying love for George Michael (which culminates in a drug-trip recreation of the ""Faith"" video that just kind of sits there). Other times the film kills time with labored detours as during a protracted exchange with Anna Faris playing herself. Not since Lets Be Cops has an action-comedy relied so heavily on chemistry trumping material.Like its main characters Keanu plays tough (there are flashes of sudden violence) but its soft and gooey at heart pushing Clarence and Rell through programmatic actualization arcs. Will the former learn to stand up for himself and earn the respect of his wife and daughter? Will the latter get over his heartache and woo gangbanging beauty Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish)? What you end up missing most is a little satirical bite. Keanu often plays like a vague stoner-comedy relative of the Harold amp; Kumar series with a purring feline (inevitably voiced by his namesake in a fantasy sequence) serving the same plot-advancing function as a bad case of the munchies. But the Harold amp; Kumar films for all their broad hijinks consistently managed to slip in some sly racial and cultural commentary--and so for that matter did Key and Peele themselves just about every week on television. Keanu flirts with really getting into the identity politics implied by its premise; theres a very funny tossed-off bit in which Clarence and Rell argue about who grew up in a rougher neighborhood each insisting that he was beat up by bigger scarier guys. Mostly though the film just coasts on the expert bluster and hysterical shtick of its headliners. The best deserve better.

Keegan-Michael Key (left) and Jordan Peele find themselves in a difficult spot as they try to rescue a cat in ""Keanu."" Photo Steve Dietl Associated Press Keanu a fun tribute to 80s action comedies 1 / 3 Back to Gallery For a movie with such an original premise ""Keanu"" is saturated with familiarity. The gangster/stoner/kitten heist comedy features Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele at peak ""Key amp; Peele"" while adding recognizable beats from 1980s/early-90s buddy action movies. Its effective both as a thank-you to loyal supporters after their five-season television partnership ended last year and a love letter to the makers of ""New Jack City"" and ""48 Hrs."" ""Keanu"" seems as if its on cruise control most of the time ultimately to a fault. But theres a balance here that wasnt easy to accomplish. It gives fans what they want while also working most of the time as pulse-pounding escapism. Even though he has almost nothing to do with the actual movie the spirit of a ""Speed""-era Keanu Reeves is present throughout. The biggest trap co-writers Peele and Alex Rubens needed to avoid was feeling like the movie was a five-minute sketch that goes on 93 minutes too long. Instead they completed a project that might be considerably less funny without its stars and its core gimmick but could still exist as a coherent film. Clarence and Rell (Key and Peele) are cousins who live in the suburbs stuck in respective ruts. When Rells beloved cat ends up in the hands of a gangster (Method Man) the friends must cloak themselves in stereotypes to infiltrate the criminal underworld. None of the above is to be taken seriously which makes the added melodrama of the Jerry Bruckheimer-era action movie vibe such a great cover. The best of those movies from ""48 Hrs."" to ""Bad Boys"" operated in self-parody reveling in the fantasy worlds they created. The ""Keanu"" writers and director Peter Atencio traffic in action movie tropes both obvious and subtle including a finale at a mansion that were pretty sure was also used at the end of ""Beverly Hills Cop."" There are jokes in between too many of which have been spoiled in the trailers. Will Forte is excellent as the drug dealer who tells Rell and Clarence about the existence of the 17th Street Blips a gang made up of outcasts from the Bloods and the Crips. A running joke involving Clarences minivan and love of George Michael never gets old even after six or seven callbacks throughout the film. At times the movie seems like a pop culture test filled with nods and winks for those who watch way too many movies and TV shows. For instance Method Man plays a gang leader named Cheddar no doubt a relative of the gangbanger named Cheese he portrayed in ""The Wire."" There are also ""Key amp; Peele"" references including inside jokes seemingly embedded in other inside jokes. The duos sketch ""Substitute Teacher"" is reimagined as a real film with Liam Neeson in the starring role. As they do in their television show Key and Peele seem most assured when theyre toying with the audiences racial preconceptions then turning those expectations upside down in the name of comedy. If theres one big negative its a lack of ambition. Beyond the original concept and the unexpected action movie DNA ""Keanu"" is Key and Peele operating in their comfort zone with a joke success/failure rate no better than their sketch comedy show. Peele will presumably try something more unexpected when he goes Key-less with the upcoming horror film ""Get Out."" But whether this is ""goodbye"" or ""so long for now"" its a solid piece of entertainment by two actors about to head in different directions. One more familiar Key amp; Peele project before we see what kinds of surprises Key and Peele can come up with on their own. One final note Theres an adorable kitten on the movie posters so know before buying a ticket that this is an R-rated film with a strip club as a primary setting and should be seen only by adults. Not since the puppet-filled and profane ""Team America World Police"" has a film held such a high risk of small children accidentally losing their innocence on opening day.

Its funny. It should be funnier. Keanu has a handful of good laughs but fans of the Comedy Central duo will probably be disappointed by how often the whole thing stalls. The movie begins with a drug factory take-down all in beautiful balletic slo-mo. Acrobatic gunslingers dressed in black (also Key amp; Peele) shoot up a rival operation and in the midst of the chaos a gangsters kitten runs away. The kitty-cat finds shelter at the home of Rell (Peel) a broken-hearted slacker whose romance has just evaporated. The adorable animal quickly becomes the centre of Rells life. Rell names the cat Keanu. Later he and his geeky cousin Clarence (Key) are stunned to return from a movie (a Liam Neeson movie of course) to find Rells apartment has been robbed. Keanu is missing Getting him back involves their interaction with some badass bad guys. Turns out Keanu is now the pet of a drug dealer named Cheddar (Method Man); our gormless heroes pretend to be stone cold killers to ingratiate themselves with the gangsters striking a deal to get the cat returned. The gangsta pose (and how clumsy it is) permits Key and Peele to goof with racial stereotypes. As the story progresses they get to mock Hollywoods usual take on black and Latino characters but there isnt much else going on; getting that kitten back seems to take a long time involving plenty of cartoon violence and a lot of meandering storytelling. Theres a funny bit organized around George Michaels music but it goes on too long. Same could be said about a drug-induced hallucination featuring a talking kitty. And ditto a comic drug sale scene (with a surprise actor cameo) that both goes on too long and rapidly stops being funny. Popping up in the story -- and sadly underused -- are Tiffany Haddish as a menacing gangster moll Will Forte as a druggy neighbour Nia Long as Clarences wife and Luis Guzman as a crime lord. Its a credit to the chemistry and charisma of Key and Peele that the movie works at all. Overall Keanu comes off as lazy and this comedy duo deserves better.

Steve Dietl/Courtesy of Warner Brothers Pictures hide caption toggle caption Steve Dietl/Courtesy of Warner Brothers Pictures Keegan-Michael Key as Clarence and Jordan Peele as Rell in Keanu. Steve Dietl/Courtesy of Warner Brothers Pictures With Monty Python as the exception that proves the rule the big screen has been historically unkind to sketch comedy teams hoping their offbeat sensibility will survive the leap from five-minute bits to 90-minute features -- and from cult fervor to mainstream success. Some fail outright like Mr. Shows Run Ronnie Run or The Kids in the Hall Brain Candy while others are embraced by fans after tanking like The Lonely Islands Hot Rod or The States Wet Hot American Summer. But the creative risks are always the same Either they attempt to string together sketches on a bigger scale which can make a film lumpy and episodic or they take a thin comic premise and stretch it well past the breaking point. For their first outing Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele the duo responsible for the brilliant Comedy Central show Key amp; Peele fall squarely in the latter camp. Keanu doesnt have nearly enough story to go the distance sputtering through an 80s-style action-comedy that follows a feline MacGuffin through an L.A. gangland misadventure. And yet Key and Peele have such a sensationally giddy chemistry together that the films raggedness plays in their hands like a kind of spontaneity. Whenever the fish-out-of-water jokes seem completely wrung-out theyre standing over the script with defibrillators tossing in a one-liner or a look or an inspired digression to shock the corpse back to life. By title and description Keanu sounds like a parody of the Keanu Reeves action favorite John Wick with Key and Peele infiltrating an army of bad guys on behalf of an adorable pet. Significantly more roundabout than Reeves puppy-revenge tale the film casts the pair as best friends with divergent lives Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key) is a straitlaced corporate manager with a wife a kid and George Michael on shuffle and Rell (Peele) is a bong-hitting slacker whos struggling through a recent break-up. Rell finds instant salvation when the worlds most adorable kitten turns up at his doorstep but loses the animal just as quickly when someone breaks into his apartment. Acting on a tip that a gang ran off with the cat Clarence and Rell toughen up their conspicuously dopey middle-class vibe and step into a seedy strip club that serves as headquarters for ""The 17th Street Blips"" -- so named for being castaways from the Bloods and the Crips. The Blips leader Cheddar (Method Man) mistakes them for a pair of feared assassins and Clarence and Rell roll with it dubbing themselves ""Shark Tank"" and ""Techtonic"" and affecting a toughness that doesnt come naturally. Before handing over the cat however Cheddar enlists them to teach his young dealers how to distribute a new synthetic drug thats poised to take over the streets. So begins a long surreal urban night in the vein of Adventures in Babysitting or After Hours with the buddies unwittingly taking center stage in an all-out turf war. Keanus go-to joke plays up Clarence and Rells pitiful attempts at gangsta authenticity which at best seem borrowed from half-engaged viewings of New Jack City. Key is particularly funny as an effete teetotaler whose Members-Only tough-guy routine reminds Rell of Richard Pryor playing a white guy. The film also gets laughs from ""Shark Tank"" and ""Techtonic"" persuading young hoodlums to see the virtues in corporate team-building exercises and Michaels post-Wham ballads. The mission to rescue the kitten sends Clarence and Rell pinballing from one life-threatening situation to the next to the point where Keanu feels sloppier and more haphazard than it actually is. Working from a script Peele penned with Alex Rubens the pair asks the audience to hang on for the ride along with their characters and their shaggy anything-goes approach reflects the shows spirit better than a more straightforward action-comedy might have. And beneath the silliness is the bittersweet story of a longstanding friendship withered by adulthood. Rell wants the kitten back so badly because he cant rely on his other companion. Keanu is about finding them both.

Comments Keanu Video Rated R  100 minutes  2016 Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele of the Comedy Central sketch program Key amp; Peele make their big-screen debut with this weak gangster farce which begins with a silly premise and follows it to its barely amusing conclusion. After a kitten gets loose from a violent drug lord Peele finds and adopts it naming it after his favorite underappreciated actor; bad guys break into his home and steal the cat so he and Key set out to rescue the little thing. As a comedy team the stars come off like Costello and Costello each peddling his own brand of ironic weirdness (Key spends much of his screen time trying to indoctrinate hardened thugs into the music of George Michael). The incongruity between their white-bread delivery and the bad guys jive generates a few laughs but not enough to salvage this thing. Peter Atencio directed a script by Peele and Alex Rubens; with Will Forte Nia Long Luis Guzman and Method Man. By J.R.

EntertainmentMovies Keanu a funny caper with comedic duo Key and Peele -- and one cute kitty Originally published April 28 2016 at 1209 pm Updated April 28 2016 at 240 pm Keegan-Michael Key left and Jordan Peele star in ""Keanu."" (Steve Dietl/Steve Dietl) ""Keanu"" Brilliant comedic duo Key and Peele play regular guys who go undercover in drug-gang territory to rescue a tabby kitten. 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Here kitty kitty kitty ... OK why dont more movies have kittens in them? I can think of a dozen recent ones off the top of my head (most egregiously this weeks ""Mothers Day"") that would have been vastly improved by an adorable miniature cat. Thats the hook of the uneven but thoroughly enjoyable ""Keanu"" in which a couple of regular guys infiltrate a gangland drug operation. Youve seen that movie before with guns and violence blending with gallows humor but theres a twist. The title character is a tabby kitten so ridiculously cute that everyone who sees him wants to keep him -- even dangerous druglords. (And me. If the Humane Society had a kiosk outside the theater door theyd do a brisk business.) ""Keanu"" is the brainchild of Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele the creative minds behind the Comedy Central series ""Key and Peele."" Here they play cousins Clarence and Rell; respectively a tightly wound family man and a stoner artist depressed after a breakup. Rells spirits are lifted by the arrival on his doorstep of said kitten whos quickly christened Keanu (a joke that pays off later but youll have to listen carefully) -- and who just as quickly disappears. Movie Review    Keanu with Keegan-Michael Key Jordan Peele Method Man Tiffany Haddish Luis Guzman Nia Long Will Forte. Directed by Peter Atencio from a screenplay by Peele and Alex Rubens. 100 minutes. Rated R for violence language throughout drug use and sexuality/nudity. Several theaters. The Blips -- outtakes from the Bloods and Crips -- are suspected and Clarence and Rell must transform their language their bearing their clothing (Clarence tries without much success to pull his khakis down low) and even their names to enter gang territory and get Keanu back. ""Were in the market"" Clarence explains in his best tough-guy-from-the-movies voice ""for a gangster pet."" Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson? Here are their policy positionsA great loss 3 dead 1 injured in Mukilteo shooting  WATCHDoctor who killed partner child in Seattle penthouse gets 49 yearsAP FACT CHECK Misfires in Hillary Clintons speech6 Seattle spots for truly great pizza  VIEWUnlimited Digital Access. 1 for 4 weeks.The transformation from sketch comedy to full-length feature film (this is Key and Peeles first) can be a rocky one -- see or rather dont see the long list of failed ""Saturday Night Live""-inspired movies. And ""Keanu"" its true often feels padded; you sense that lurking in this movie is perhaps the funniest 10-minute sketch ever. But Key and Peeles fast-talking chemistry as they shift their language instantly from suburbanite to street (a theme in many of their sketches) make Clarence and Rells transformation into bellowing gun-wielding tough guys and back again feel fresh and often very funny. (In one perfect scene Clarence has to switch instantly between personas on the phone to his wife who wants to know why hes suddenly talking like hes in a gangster movie.) And oh that kitten. (Or rather seven kittens; it took a village.) In the early scenes Keanu runs slow-motion across the streets of South Central his too-long legs tangling beneath him; later he squeakily meows up at the camera with that alert angelic innocence kittens exude. Give that kitty an Oscar right now. And then send him to my doorstep. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

While devastating for a fan - I was a diehard - it was also exciting. They are such fresh sharp and funny voices that Im down for any new medium they want to try their hands at. Slideshow Keanu Key and Peeles action comedy a bit of a letdown Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon Perhaps thats why Keanu their first foray starring in feature films feels like such a letdown. Its a comedy that has its moments but it cant sustain the energy and buzz that crackled throughout their sketch show. Written by Peele and Key amp; Peele alum Alex Rubens Keanu is about the theft of an adorable kitten by a gang of drug dealers and the attempt to get it back. The feline focus makes the movie seem like it was written for the Internet age. But in a lot of ways Keanu hearkens back to movies like Die Hard and Lethal Weapon action movies with a sense of humor. Its smarter than those movies because Peele and Rubens seem less concerned with getting a joke onto every page of the screenplay and more concerned with the transformation of the duo at the storys center. Key and Peele play Clarence and Rell nerdy cousins - ""You sound like Richard Pryor doing an impression of a white guy"" Rell tells Clarence - who have an argument about whose childhood neighborhood was harder based on who got beat up the most. Rell is distraught after a breakup but finds solace in Keanu a stray kitten that formerly belonged to a fierce drug dealer. When the kitten is kidnapped by another group of toughs - led by the menacing Cheddar (Method Man) - Rell and Clarence decide to go undercover as their own sort of gangster in order to get Keanu back. The movie is about how we code-switch to fit in when were in different situations and around different people and how that can be fun - although in the case of Keanu its somewhat deadly as well. But Keanu doesnt go far enough. Key amp; Peele was searing and incisive about race and American culture and Keanu doesnt even scratch the surface. Its occasionally funny - there are two great cameos by very game performers one in voice only and Key and Peele remain an incomparable comedic duo. But after five glorious seasons of Key amp; Peele I know what their first movie could have been. Not even a cute cat can change that. meichelphillynews.com215-854-5909 Keanu Directed by Jeremy Saulnier. With Joe Cole Imogen Poots Alia Shawkat Patrick Stewart and Anton Yelchin.

Key and Peele get in too deep while pursuing a cat thief Director Peter Atencio (Running Time 140) R Violence language throughout drug use and sexuality/nudity. Area theaters. Key and Peele are unlikely action heroes in their first feature comedy -- and to let the cat out of the bag it works For five years Keegan Michael-Key and Jordan Peele have been making fans laugh with their biting satirical sketches on their Comedy Central show. In ""Keanu"" opening Friday they bring their brand of humor to the big screen playing two nerdy friends Clarence and Ralph who get caught up in a gang war between drug dealers. Their unlikely escapade happens when Ralphs kitten Keanu is taken by a gang called the 17th Street Blips led by a thug named ""Cheddar"" (rapper Method Man). In over their heads Clarence and Ralph pretend to be a duo of gang assassins and are conscripted to help the Blips with their drug deals. Keegan-Michael Key (l.) and Jordan Peele in ""Keanu."" (Steve Dietl/Warner Bros. Entertainment) KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY OF KEY amp; PEELE MIGHT FLEE TO CANADA IF TRUMP WINS In a particularly funny gag the assassins for whom the main characters are mistaken hitmen so deadly they wipe out dozens of armed foes in the opening scene are played by Key and Peele as well. The title star is ready for his closeup. (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Clarence has extra incentive to prove he can be a tough guy since back home hes a meek family man henpecked by his wife (Nia Long). Ralph just wants his beloved cat back. Thats when the fur really flies. Method Man stars in the film as Cheddar alongside Tiffany Haddish as Hi-C. (Steve Dietl/Warner Bros. Entertainment) ""Keanu"" takes most of its cues from buddy action-comedies like ""Bad Boys"" ""Pineapple Express"" and even Method Mans own ""How High"" and never tries to reinvent that wheel. It also wouldnt be nearly as funny with anyone but Key and Peele in the lead roles because it allows them to do what they do best -- creating exaggerated characters and playing them up for the biggest laughs. Granted ""Keanu"" is mostly made up of two or three jokes stretched paper thin -- Clarences love for George Michael for instance is milked longer than the pop singers actual career -- and some of the bits may have worked better in a five-minute sketch. But when all else fails the comics can rely on their adorable scene-stealing kitten co-star to keep the audiences attention. Peele even sees a little romance from the Blips sole female member (Tiffany Haddish). Maybe ""Keanu"" would have been stronger in the hands of a more experienced director -- they brought Peter Atencio over from their show -- but Key and Peele know how to deliver the laughs and killer chemistry.

Photo Warner Bros MOVIE REVIEW KEANU Running time 98 minutes. Rated R (violence language nudity). ""You sound like Richard Pryor doing an impression of a white person"" Jordan Peele barks at Keegan-Michael Key in their first movie outing a funny shambling buddy comedy that mostly serves as a vehicle for our two stars to do what they do best which is riff on race and pop culture. And of course theres that kitten. They dont make em much more adorable than the fuzzy tiny-voiced Keanu whose namesake shows up in brief voice-over just to make the whole thing delightfully meta. Keanu who arrives one day on the doorstep of the depressed Rell (Peele) is abducted by the 17th Street Blips (theyre a rogue combination of Bloods and Crips see) necessitating a rescue mission by Rell and his cousin Clarence (Key) two deeply suburban dudes who must masquerade as murderous gangstas to rescue the little puffball. Yes its basically a really long ""Key amp; Peele"" sketch but if you were a fan of that show this will be welcome news -- and if you werent well ""Keanu"" is a reasonably good introduction having been directed by Peter Atencio who helmed every episode of the highly cinematic ""Kamp;P."" The manic Key has a slight comic edge here with his Beaker-like reactions to violence and his characters obsession with George Michael and Wham (In one scene a carful of drug dealers listens rapt as he concludes a story with ""And nobody ever sees Ridgeley again."") Method Man is sufficiently menacing as Cheddar the drug honcho with a soft spot for kittens while Luis Guzman turns up as a rival gangster and Will Forte sports awful cornrows as Rells hapless weed dealer. One comic actress puts in an amusing surprise cameo as the worst version of herself and Key and Peele do double duty as a pair of zombie-like drug lords stalking Rell and Clarence. ""Keanu"" isnt perfect; it could all have been tightened up a bit -- and perhaps the duo shot themselves in the foot by making the films trailer so very good. But like the Pryor-Wilder pairing the duo has been name-checking as their career role model it also leaves you eager to see what these two incisive comic minds come up with next.

At GTA theatres. 99 minutes. 14AKeanu is named for Keanu Reeves only in the drive-by sticking sense of Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele whose dearly departed Comedy Central show adored absurdity.The movie should more accurately be titled Worlds Cutest Kitten since the Keanu in question is an adorable gray-and-white furrball who manages to melt the hearts of L.A.s most dangerous gangstas and wannabe gangstas along with the tickers of everybody in the audience.Article Continued BelowWhen the cat is in the picture the movie is a whisker away from comedy purr-fection and who cares about Key and Peele? In their big-screen debut directed by their TV helmer Peter Atencio and scripted by Peele with show writer Alex Rubens the duo bravely ignore the dictum often attributed to W.C. Fields ""Never work with children or animals.""The worlds cutest kitten is the star of the show in new action comedy Keanu.  (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture)   Keanu stars Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele.  (Steve Dietl / Warner Bros.)  Even when Keanu (or WCK) isnt in a scene the film is still pretty funny although the racial humour gets as repetitive as the gangbanger shootouts.Key and Peele are above-mentioned wannabes Clarence and Rell mild-mannered cousins and BFFs who adopt a stray kitty to restore Rells reason to live. Hes been dumped by his girlfriend who couldnt abide his couch-surfing and bong-boosting ways (go figure).Clarence and Rell dont know that Keanu is the fleet-footed survivor of a crime-turf massacre seen in the opening frames led by the sinister cloaked figures of the shadowy Allentown gang who still have Glocks to cock. Our hapless heroes are also brought up short when Keanu ends up in the paws of a drug lord named Cheddar (Method Man) who also loves kittens -- and dont let that cheesy name fool you into thinking Cheddars a mouse.Clarence and Rell adopt street names and attitudes to bluff their way into Cheddars posse which is guarded by the no-guff Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish).This scenario allows free rein for patented Key and Peele riffing on race rap and drug stereotypes while also freestyling on pop-cult obsessions -- namely Clarences insane love of the vanilla music of George Michael while the hoods white drug dealer (Will Forte) is mad for hip-hop.None of these jokers can scratch up a laugh or sigh like Keanu who is assured of a sequel through a plot twist thats as goofy as the films celebrity cameos.

Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele in Keanu Keanu      (out of five) Director Peter Atencio Cast Keegan-Michael Key Jordan Peele Method Man Rating R (violence strong language throughout drug use and sexuality/nudity) Running time 98 min. Related links Meet the kitten stars of Keanu By Preston Jonespjonesdfw.comPosted 1106am on Thursday Apr. 28 2016 Thursday Apr. 28 2016 Sunday May. 01 2016 By Preston Jones Fort Worth Star-Telegram If the premise of Keanu -- two adult men spending a violent weekend searching for a lost kitten -- seems far too slender for a feature film well you underestimate the abilities of Key and Peele.That would be Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele the dazzling comic minds behind the acclaimed Comedy Central television series that concluded its run after five seasons last fall. In the series glorious run the comedians introduced the world to the concept of Liam Neesons baroquely named college football players and a couple multiplexes worth of cinematic parodies. Its that last element of Key amp; Peele most evident in Keanu a riotous homage to a very specific strain of action filmmaking.Those who grew up with (or have a deep affinity for) the oeuvres of John Woo Tony Scott or John McTiernan or appreciate the blood-spattered efficiency of sleek harsh B-movies like last years John Wick will find much to love here. Director Peter Atencio a longtime Key and Peele collaborator (he directed every one of Key amp; Peeles 53 episodes) working from a script by Peele and Alex Rubens grounds what is an absurd story -- with a handful of ludicrous detours -- with well-rounded protagonists kinetic set pieces and some genuine shocks. Key stars as suburban nebbish Clarence Goobril an uptight father and husband whose cousin Rell (Peele) is reeling from a breakup as the film opens. (Before the audience is introduced to the pair there is a frenetic bullet-riddled sequence set in a church -- also featuring Key and Peele as taciturn assassins -- that would bring a tear to Woos eye.)When Rell discovers a kitten at his front door the briskly paced story kicks into gear. In short order said feline (dubbed Keanu by Rell ""I think it means cool breeze in Hawaiian"" he explains to Clarence) is stolen from him by a group of murderous drug-dealing thugs led by the vicious Cheddar (Method Man).The narrative unfolds over the course of one wild spectacularly violent and drug-fueled 36 hours as Clarence and Rell pose as sinister callous killers they are not in order to reclaim the adorable Keanu. (The crowd let out a contented ""aww"" nearly every time the kitten appeared at a preview screening I attended.) Much of the films delights lie in its surprises so revealing more of the plots twists and turns would spoil the fun -- although it is worth noting Keanus abundant and seemingly unironic affection for George Michaels solo catalog which could change forever the way the world hears his hit single Faith.What keeps Keanu from slipping into mindless lunacy is the nuanced sensitive work of Key and Peele (who yes slip in a Liam Neesons reference). Even while the supporting characters are generally playing broad stereotypes the pairs effervescent chemistry propels the film and makes the familiar narrative seem fresh even as it hits the expected beats. Pitched as a sort of film Hollywood struggles to make in an age of endless sequels and franchise-building -- an action comedy that manages to portray both elements convincingly -- Keanu also draws upon a deep well of satire and dry wit exploring race and gender in ways most blockbusters avoid altogether. (That said Clarences wife played by Nia Long seems to exist purely as a plot device which is surprising given Tiffany Haddishs fully realized gangbanger Hi-C.)The pair also understands the value of brevity -- Keanu is a lean 98 minutes a refreshing change of pace from Judd Apatows two hour-plus comedy marathons of late -- and the judicious usage of cameos (again flying in the face of star-packed-for-no-reason comedies such as the recent Zoolander 2) to achieve maximum impact. The movie ends exactly when it should and crams in plenty of high- and low-brow jokes along the way. Keanu is fueled by a clear love of not only the action genre but moviemaking in general -- one of Rells hobbies is making a calendar (strictly for personal use) of Keanu posing in recreations of scenes from Reservoir Dogs Mad Max Fury Road and Nightmare on Elm Street.The appreciation for the rhythms and visual language of a certain style of movie animates nearly every frame of Keanu -- Key and Peele kid because they care.Whats more by lovingly tweaking Hollywood conventions Key and Peele also manage to deftly transition from the small screen to the silver screen. (Key and Peele have each appeared in numerous other films in bit roles but Keanu marks the duos first official joint cinematic effort.)That leap is far more difficult to make than it might seem. Melissa McCarthy moving from her CBS sitcom Mike amp; Molly is perhaps the current patron saint of such a move and Amy Schumer also eased from her critically acclaimed Comedy Central series to the multiplex with last years Trainwreck. But Keanu instills confidence that together or apart Key and Peele will handle Hollywood just fine.

USA TODAYAt times ""Keanu"" feels like a ""Key amp; Peele"" sketch stretched thin but thats not necessarily a bad thing.Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key) and Hannah (Nia Long) are husband and wife in ""Keanu.""(Photo Steve Dietl)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4 out of 5 stars""Key amp; Peele"" only ran four seasons on Comedy Central but it already seems destined for classic status among sketch shows. Stars Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele -- each the son of one White and one Black parent -- served up consistently witty and irreverent riffs on the complex racial dynamics in the multiculti 21st century code-switching merrily as they skewered stereotypes of every stripe.They defined ""Blackish"" before ""Black-ish"" did.The friends feature-film debut picks off where their series left off and if ""Keanu"" sometimes comes off as another sketch stretched a little thin that doesnt put it in too shabby of company. It may not be as great as ""The Blues Brothers"" but its up there with ""Waynes World"" -- and light-years ahead of ""Coneheads.""Cousins Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key left) and Rell (Jordan Peele) have their hands full with ""Keanu."" (Photo Steve Dietl)As usual the two stars play versions of themselves. Key is Clarence Goobril a nerdy suburban dad and Peele is Rell Williams a slightly hipper pot-smoking photographer. In the dumps over a breakup Rell finds a new love when a tabby kitten shows up on his doorstep. But when the preternaturally adorable Keanu is kitty-napped by a local drug kingpin named Cheddar (Method Man) the dorky duo find themselves toughing it up in the hood on a quest to rescue the wee beastie.What follows is a gleefully profane cartoonishly violent sendup of movie tropes both gangsta and otherwise (""The Matrix"" is a favorite target). And of course the characters fish-out-of-water status in gangland is the primary driver of the punch lines.Will Forte plays a drug dealer in Keanu."" (Photo Steve Dietl)Pressured to come up with an intimidating street name Clarence dubs himself ""Shark Tank"" and draws on his expertise as a corporate team-builder to help a crew of drug dealers up their game. ""Wordness to the turdness"" he exclaims at one point somehow never raising suspicions about his murderous bona fides.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Pinterest""Keanu"" reaches the heights of hilarity in an extended scene in which Rell and his newly appointed ""trainee"" Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish) make a designer-drug delivery to the home of a onetime Hollywood starlet (a surprise cameo that wont be spoiled here). As their sales call takes a violently surreal turn worthy of ""Pulp Fiction"" the camera cuts to Clarences minivan where our second fake-it-till-he-makes-it gangster has the rest of the crew grooving to George Michael (""Yeah hes light-skinned""). Its sublimely silly.Clarence (Keegan-Michael Key right) and Rell (Jordan Peele) try to rescue ""Keanu."" (Photo Steve Dietl)The action half of this action-comedy takes over in the third act which generates fewer laughs as it spins out a series of too many climaxes (call it the ""Face/Off"" effect). But the comic momentum never quite grinds to a halt and even if the occasional attempts at genuine pathos come up short ""Keanu"" is still an entertaining extension of the ""Key amp; Peele"" aesthetic.Oh and the kitten is as heart-tuggingly cute as anything youll find on YouTube -- and hes kind of tough too.Reach the reviewer at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.AZCENTRALKeanu (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsKeanu 4 starsDirector Peter Atencio.Cast Keegan-Michael Key Jordan Peele Method Man.Rating R for violence language throughout drug use and sexuality/nudity. 30 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/26xini0 More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

Watch the trailer for Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peeles ""Keanu."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune We expect our comedies to be hit-and-miss. Theyre different from action movies which in recent years have become numbingly relentless -- hit-and-never-miss unless youre third thug from the left and swarthy and your job is to shoot and then die.Now we have the strange case of ""Keanu"" starring two extremely funny people Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele just off their five-season sketch comedy TV run in their first theatrical showcase as a comedy duo. Written by Peele and ""Key and Peele"" alum Alex Rubens directed by fellow ""Key and Peele"" veteran Peter Atencio the movie is hit-and-miss in an unusually clear-cut way. Its funny for 45-50 minutes. Then its strained and abrasive and entirely too devoted to action-movie tropes for 45-50 minutes minus end credits. I can recommend the first half.MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR In fact ""Keanu"" is recommendable if only for the bit where Peele and Key who play LA cousins one a sad-sack stoner the other a tightly wound minivan owner and family man in salmon-colored shorts are sitting in a car arguing. The cousins are about to get mixed up in a drug war and the pursuit of a very popular kitten. Theyre in the car debating and in expertly varied degrees of subtlety both actors refuse to let the other one have the last word. The bit keeps going and its fantastic -- completely off-plot (who cares about plot with a movie like this?) daringly extended but in the end just right.You cant force comic chemistry in case you hadnt noticed. You can however make the mistake of forcing your stars into settling for weaker material than they deserve. We meet the kitty star of ""Keanu"" in the prologue when the prized pet of a ruthless drug lord escapes a gangland slaughter and ends up on the doorstep of Rell (Peele) whose girlfriend has recently bailed on the relationship. ""She said my life wasnt going anywhere"" Rell says weeping in bed while lighting up a bong.The cat changes everything and the light comes back into Rells eyes. But then one night Rells place is ransacked and Keanu is cat-napped. The rest of the movie follows Rell and Clarence (Key) on an odyssey of feline retrieval that puts them in direct conflict with drug lord Cheddar (Method Man); his crew dominated by Hi-C (Tiffany Haddish); the notorious Allentown killers (Key and Peele in cameos) who had the cat before them; and an increasingly violent and wearying script. Keanu review Steve Dietl Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele in ""Keanu."" Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele in ""Keanu."" (Steve Dietl) Movies generally do not collapse within a specific scene but ""Keanu"" does or did for me at least. In a key drug-deal sequence in order to assert their street cred and recover the cat our pretend-thug heroes accompany Cheddars crew as they deliver a nasty new recreational hallucinogen to the Hollywood home of ""Scary Movie"" regular Anna Faris (convincing as herself). While Clarence turns his newfound colleagues on to the musical glories of George Michael in the minivan outside Rell and company navigate an escalating situation inside. The scene plods on offering a few stray laughs but no momentum. And before you know it ""Keanu"" is in trouble. The second half relies on bug-eyed panic and screaming and blood squibs and the obvious in all the obvious directions. The actors nearly get lost in their own movie. On the other hand people love these guys so much for such evident and entertaining reasons that ""Keanu"" may find its audience after all.

The film is less about plot -- there isnt much of one -- than about debunking African-American stereotypes. At its best ""Keanu"" is reminiscent of Woody Allens early funny films such as ""Take the Money and Run"" and ""Bananas"" which were also uneven but frequently hilarious.Working from a screenplay by Peele and Alex Rubens director Peter Atencio maintains an engaging balance between humor and mayhem.

USA TODAYKeegan-Michael Key left Jordan Peele and a kitten in the action comedy Keanu.(Photo Steve Dietl)Putting a tiny kitten in an action film sounds like a bonkers idea. That is until you see the bizarrely wonderful sight of a tiny kitten in an action film.The little guy in director Peter Atencios action comedy Keanu (1/2 out of four; rated R; in theaters Friday) is fast and furious -- and furry -- and complements the culturally relevant comedy of stars Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. They bring their talent for creating entertaining character duos from the small screen to the cineplex for the first time though Keanu doesnt on the whole match the sheer hilarity and brilliance of the Key amp; Peele TV sketch show.Peele who co-wrote the script with Alex Rubens stars as Rell a newly-dumped guy who is in a serious funk until a small cat shows up at his door. His milquetoast cousin Clarence is a L.A. corporate team-builder type told by his wife (Nia Long) to ""be himself"" while she and the kids are away for the weekend and hes also enamored with this ball of fur that Rell has named Keanu.USA TODAYKey and Peele scratch their way into Hollywood with KeanuAfter a night out at the movies the pair return home to find Keanu gone and Rells apartment ransacked. They find out from the drug dealer next door (a gonzo Will Forte) that the 17th Street Blips are to blame and Clarence and Rell go undercover as violent killers to get Keanu back from the Blips leader Cheddar (Method Man).Key and Peele showcase their skills in a series of progressively worse situations for Clarence and Rell. From a strip club with the fitting name HPV to a shootout at a palatial mansion the two middle-class African-American dudes have to be as hardcore as possible even though theyre usually the geekiest guys in the room. ""You sound like Richard Pryor doing an impression of a white guy"" Rell tells Clarence after one of his early gangsta-speak misfires.Its a sketch-type conceit stretched to movie length that wears thin at times. When the stars are on their game though they keep the laughs coming -- Keys Clarence teaching a trio of thugs about the wonders of George Michael is priceless as his musically tinged drug trip and Peele also has some nice moments with Tiffany Haddish who plays Bliptown tough girl Hi-C.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Key and Peele tell us about the epic George Michael dance scene in Keanu. USA TODAYKitties litter the set of Key and Peeles KeanuKeanu borrows stylistic references and slo-mo moves from action movies such as Bad Boys and Point Break (that other Keanus presence is felt in multiple scenes) although the films most special effect is its title critter. The kitten gets a decent amount of screen time scratching up a photo of Rells ex and cuddling in Cheddars tattooed forearms but hes missed when hes not around.

TWITTER 4/29/2016 Key and Peele leave cable TV behind for a big-screen walk on the wrong side of the law. A tale of code-switching the enduring appeal of George Michaels Faith and a feline who is all kittens to all people Peter Atencios Keanu marks the first big-screen vehicle for Comedy Central sensations Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele. Playing middle-class cousins forced to impersonate gangsters so they can rescue the movies eponymous pet (what do you mean you dont follow that logic?) the actors make the transition with ease in a consistently funny action-comedy. This may not be adequate compensation for the end of their series which gave them so many more opportunities to try on new personalities and take one-gag ideas for a spin but it will delight the shows fans while winning over others unlucky enough never to have seen it. The actors do in fact get to play two extra roles here. They enter the film as a pair of ""phantom"" drug dealers from Allentown who shoot up a rival druglords operation in a Carmina Burana-blasting sequence that could easily have been a Key amp; Peele parody. During the mayhem we witness the escape of the victims pet a tiny gray-and-white kitty so precious that even a hypothetical couldnt-be-real movie critic with a deep-seated dislike for cats would find him adorable. The kitten scampers across L.A. winding up at the doorstep of Rell (Peele) who has been in a heartbroken stupor since his girlfriend dumped him. Suddenly life has meaning again. Naturally Rell names his savior Keanu. Two weeks later Keanu vanishes in a break-in. (In a jab at film conventions typical of these comedians the sky erupts with rain just in time for Rell to find the cat gone.) Rell and his family-man cousin Clarence (Key) whose wife and daughter are gone for the weekend set out to find the cat theyre sure has been kidnapped. Which is less likely That the men go to a rough-part-of-town strip club expecting to find Keanu or the cat is there -- renamed New Jack and now doted on by Cheddar a drug merchant played by Method Man? Though they enter the club wearing their dorkiest duds Clarence and Rell try to fit in with thugspeak and puffed-up posturing. They claim to be the Allentown assassins when the opportunity arises and stumble into an arrangement that could only make sense here If they go out on a drug deal with this crew theyll be given New Jack as a gesture of respect. Long before the men have run out of funny ways to flub the epithet-laden slang theyre trying to recreate based on movies theyve seen Clarence and Rell are neck-deep in actual crime. While making a delivery of Cheddars new drug (called ""Holy Shit"" it makes you feel ""like youre smokin crack with God"") they find themselves at a movie stars home and wind up leaving with blood on their hands. (Lets not spoil the surprise cameo but her performance is enjoyably deranged.) They also leave their new crew changed in a way few viewers will be able to predict. Getting Keanu back cant be this simple and it isnt. The kitty has won hearts all over this City of Angels and our newly emboldened (if not exactly toughened) heroes will stare death down or more likely cower before it a couple more times before this quest is complete. Tragically for Key amp; Peele fans none of their daring feats require cross-dressing. Thats an oversight that simply must be corrected in the pairs next feature.

In under three minutes the boisterous snippets from comedy duo Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peeles first starring vehicle delivered the hilarious essence of their high concept action-comedy Stoner movie geek Rell (Peele) overcomes a recent breakup with the discovery of an adorable kitten at his doorstep which is abruptly stolen by a local gang. With his buttoned-up cousin Clarence (Key) by his side Rell ventures into an arena of bullets and car chases in an absurdly reckless attempt to recover his feline companion. And...scene Pairing dramatic imagery with an adorable MacGuffin and two faces known for their goofy TV routine the trailer could almost have functioned as a tossed-off bit on the duos now-defunct Comedy Central Show ""Key amp; Peele."" The very existence of an entire movie made on studio dime represents some kind of subversive victory but its not a complete triumph. Tinged with the same playful upending of racial stereotypes found in ""Key amp; Peele"" along with the zaniest use of shootouts and explosions this side of ""Pineapple Express"" the trailer for ""Keanu"" not only epitomizes the movies appeal; it highlights the parts that work. Like a greatest hits compilation that runs out of steam this jovial buddy comedy formula (co-written by its stars) returns to variations of the same punchlines again and again. Wildly entertaining in parts ""Keanu"" overstays its welcome and just keeps going showing the growing pains of sketch comedy drawn out to epic proportions. Fortunately as far as that formula goes the ""Key amp; Peele"" team comes equipped with a built-in chemistry and keen satiric focus. While gentler than ""The Chappelle Show"" the duos gags about black identity in America involve an amusing contrast with their own distance from it. The funniest bit in the ""Keanu"" trailer finds the two men venturing to a seedy strip club on the path of their missing kitty and realizing that they need to adopt ""urban"" mannerisms to blend in. (""You sound like Richard Pryor doing an impression of a white guy"" Rell tells Clarence.) That ends up setting the stage for the main twist as Rell and Clarence face down drug lord Chedder (Method Man) disguised as a pair of local hit man and agree to accompany his minions on a delivery in order to get the cat back. From the exaggerated gangster nicknames the duo dream up for themselves (""Techtonic"" and ""Shark Tank"") to the name of the gang itself (The Blips because theyre dropouts from the Bloods and the Crips) ""Keanu"" offers plenty of imaginative ways to mess around with the hollow signposts of black identity in mainstream storytelling. Directed by ""Key amp; Peele"" regular Peter Atencio at a fast clip with the polished feel of a genuine Michael Bay-level blockbuster the movie also provides a genuinely fun black action buddy comedy just two months after ""Ride Along 2"" defined the market standard. Whenever it starts to drag ""Keanu"" delivers another satisfying bit to remind viewers of the talent in play. There may be no better recent example of cultural disconnect than the scene in which Clarence talks a carful of gun-toting criminals to appreciate the melodies of George Michael. Of course the best parts of ""Keanu"" have less to do with edgy satire than pure outrageousness particularly when it comes to the title character. Rells obsession over his new little buddy whom he photographs at home in a series of classic movie scenes (""The Shining"" is a highlight) reflects the duos commitment to making the right jokes stick. However while it never vaults off into the gleefully wacky heights of the ""Harold amp; Kumar"" franchise it similarly turns a pair of minority characters into 21st century slapstick heroes. Spiced up with one fantastic cameo from a comedic actress who doesnt do enough these days ""Keanu"" reads like a plea for more diverse dumb comedies. (Take that OscarsSoWhite.) But ""Keanu"" never fully reconciles the comedy with the action so that as the final act fills up with shootings and explosions theres no discernible punchline aside from their very existence here. On a certain level ""Keanu"" mainly exists to celebrate Hollywoods latest hope for renewing old formulas (theyre already attached to produce a reboot of ""Police Academy""). While that kind of filmmaking could use some fresh blood its a challenge that falls beneath these savvy comedic artists. Rather than delivering much in the way of cutting-edge satire ""Keanu"" is just as stupid as it looks. Grade B- ""Keanu"" premiered at the 2016 SXSW Film Festival. It opens nationwide on April 29.

March 13 2016 | 0441AM PT Key and Peele reteam on the big screen with this lamer-than-expected feline-felony action-comedy. A two-hour online cat-video binge would yield as many ""awws"" and probably far more laughs than ""Keanu"" an initially amusing but fatally overstretched action-comedy that marks a lamer-than-expected big-screen outing for Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele following the conclusion last year of their frequently brilliant cable series. Enjoyable for a good 15 minutes or so mostly due to the scene-stealing powers of the adorable much-coveted kitty whose name gives the movie its title this is otherwise a stale repetitive effort whose one-joke premise -- two suburban buddies forced to pass themselves off as gangsters in a grimy underworld where they clearly dont belong -- never achieves comic liftoff much less the richly subversive dimensions typical of Key and Peeles best work. The Warner Bros./New Line release debuted as a ""work-in-progress"" at SXSW ahead of its planned April 29 release though it would take more than a few technical tweaks to significantly improve what feels at the moment like 100 minutes of hit-or-miss comic purr-gatory. That the movie reteams a number of collaborators from Comedy Centrals ""Key and Peele"" -- including director Peter Atencio and screenwriters Peele and Alex Rubens -- would seem to bear out the notion that their distinctive brand of double-edged satire is best served and consumed in five-minute sketches. ""Keanu"" by contrast is one flabby tabby that seems to be overstaying its welcome at the half-hour mark and leans heavily thereafter on over-the-top violence whenever its clear the jokes arent landing. That tendency is apparent in the opening sequence in which the notorious Allentown brothers (imagine darker longer-haired more offensive versions of the Salamanca cousins from ""Breaking Bad"") stage a bloody attack on a church where drugs are being secretly manufactured. The lone innocent bystander is the aforementioned kitten who through some miracle of CGI rendering manages to survive dodging bullets left and right in slo-mo and even winning over the brothers cold black hearts before escaping and making its way to the suburbs of Los Angeles. There the tiny furball winds up on the doorstep of Rell (Peele) a pot-smoking underachiever who having just been dumped by his girlfriend embraces the kitten as a divine offering and christens it Keanu. And why not? Much like the actor whose name he borrows kitty Keanu makes an effortlessly expressive camera subject and requires no dialogue -- only a nimble physicality and a series of cute quizzical reaction shots -- to thoroughly magnetize the screen. Further cementing the connection the movie is intended in some ways as a parodic riff on ""John Wick"" the thrilling (and soon-to-be-sequelized) 2014 action film in which Keanu Reeves avenged the murder of his own beloved pet. Audiences familiar with Key and Peeles pop-cultural savvy will be unsurprised by the various on-screen allusions to crime thrillers like ""Heat"" and ""New Jack City"" plus throwaway comic references to ""Fargo"" ""The Shining"" ""Crimson Tide"" and ""Point Break"" (all of which figure into one of the movies better visual gags). The movie under scrutiny alas seems unlikely to ascend to the level of even a minor classic. The best scenes are those of Keanu bonding with his new owner Rell and his best friend Clarence (Key) a family man whose wife and daughter are conveniently sent out of town for narrative purposes. When Keanu goes missing in a burglary one night Rell becomes hellbent on getting him back and together with Clarence beats some helpful information out of his in-the-know drug dealer (Will Forte in dreads). From there the duo make their way to the strip-club hangout of the notorious 17th Street Blips (""the ones who got kicked out of the Bloods and the Crips"") led by a formidable thug named Cheddar (Method Man). Sure enough Cheddar promises to give back the purloined puss if these two self-styled heavies join his crew and help them out with some of their dirty work. Key and Peeles signature talent for tweaking and exploding racial stereotypes gets a moderate workout here as their characters are forced to ditch their plain-vanilla manner of speaking and load up on N-bombs and 12-letter expletives. But under the weight of the pro forma shootouts and car chases that ensue all the code-switching culture-clash comedy feels weak and belabored here -- particularly a running gag involving Clarences efforts to sell the hip-hop-loving Blips on the paler charms of George Michael. (Presumably the studio paid a pretty penny for the rights to ""Father Figure"" given how often it surfaces on the soundtrack.) Still the leads remain masters at mining improvisational gold from even the thinnest material Peele can register panic in a few hilariously shifty eye movements and the motormouthed Key retains his flair for both the over-the-top pronouncement and the deadpan non sequitur (""Wordness to the turdness"" he notes in a failed attempt at gangsta speak). There are a few standouts in the supporting cast as well including Tiffany Haddish as the lone female Blip (who of course must shoulder the burden of Rells emotional baggage) plus a delightfully self-mocking cameo from an actress who in the interests of preserving one of the films few legitimate pleasures shall remain nameless here. Ditto the actor who does the kittens very Reeves-like voice in one bizarre hallucination; suffice to say that as game imitations go its not half bad. ""Keanu"" alas is another story. If only the creatives involved had followed their choice of subject matter to its logical conclusion they might well have realized the ideal format for their story wasnt a movie but a meme.
