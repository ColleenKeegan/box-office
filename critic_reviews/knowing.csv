The premise is compelling but the execution is over-cooked. A string of numbers scribbled by an obsessive schoolgirl back in 1959 is given to the son of MIT astrophysicist Nicolas Cage when a time capsule buried fifty years before is disinterred. Although Cages father is a pastor since the death of his wife he has believed that life is just a random string of accidents. Then he finds patterns in the numbers that seem to correspond to the dates of disasters and starts to wonder if our fates really are predetermined. Unfortunately consideration of these weighty issues soon gives way to what feels like an episode of The Twilight Zone on steroids. There is hard scientific talk about unusual solar flare activity and intimations of a global ecological disaster. But then the pale-faced Whispering People start handing out smooth black stones and rationality gives way to portentous religious talk about Gods prophet Ezekiel. By the time single mother Rose Byrne daughter of the now-dead 50s schoolgirl takes Cage and his young son to the crazy ladys abandoned mobile home in the woods its easy to predict where this is headed. The apocalyptic images are impressive but what do they all add up to? You may end up asking yourself in the spirit of Erich Von Daniken Was God An Astronaut?""

As for the movie makers depiction of Ezekiels Biblical vision very good rendering. The scenes that include stones build up toward the final close encounter to where they are everywhere beneath Cages feet taking on a behavior of their own were also significant in the Bible "" and the rocks will cry out "" I enjoyed the film the plot heads in the right direction.

Im in a media studies lesson at school studying this film. Reading some of these comments upsets me slightly. i thought the plot was original and i love anything to do with Exogenesis and ""new beginnings"" This film clearly gives that idea out. Agreeeably Cages acting skills do slightly falter on occasion but i think thats the same with many of his films especially World Trade Centre. This is why i had deducted a star. If it wasnt for Cage the folm would recieve 5 stars.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 18 2011ClaresyFeaturedIm watching it again now for the probably 20th time. I actually really like this film you dont have to be religious to like or understand it the plane and train crashes are spectacular however I dont think it would happen like that but still the scenes are impressive I always laugh at the plane crash because Mt Cage is screaming at a bloke who was just in the plane crash and on fire which might hurt a bit and he is screaming at him to do what I dont know it is a really curiouse part. But anyway loved it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 29 2010RobertFeaturedThis is a truly great movie. The whole story is very good and is gripping and is a bit mysterious. The ending is emotional for a moment I tought that they were the 4 riders of the apocalypse but then I saw those other ""flying ships"". Great movieFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 30 2010Sandi45FeaturedJust watched the rented DVD. The film was disappointing. It didnt live up to the expectations after watching the trailer. The storyline started well with predicting incidents but the ending was rubbish. Even Nicholas Cage couldnt save the film (and he is a good actor)FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 11 2010LeeFeaturedWithout a shadow of a doubt this was the worst film I have had the misfortune to sit down and watch. Complete nonsense from start to finish. Its like someone had an idea for a movie but without any idea of where or how to end it so fell back on the old Alien Cliche. And why were the aliens modelled on Rydian from X Factor Pointless American Drivel. Id guess there was some originality in the script. The hero didnt end up saving the world from solar destruction. Instead the Rydian Aliens saved a few kids and dumped them on a new planet full of cornfields. Youd have thought that after that all that time looking after the kids and then saving them from certain death the least they could have done was to give them a house to live in.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 28 2010Hawklord67FeaturedI personally think the film was really good apart from some low quality acting from cage and his new girl friend. People seem to be missing the point and take the film too seriously Afterall it is only a fictional film and nothing more. This film makes people come to their own conclusions and I had my own as did my wife. Whether your a Christian or not it has to make you wonder what life is all about Doesnt it?FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 23 2009BazzaFeaturedProbably a bit too overrated although some good ideas and a fantastic ending. Typical of most people to want a happy ending where everything is great Dissapointing to see that most people didnt have the concentration span to spot multiple UFOs arriving on the new planet. Good religious conotations e.g Noahs Ark and Adam and Eve although slightly ridiculous frequency of distasters and links to the main characters. One to watch for the ending alone.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 24 2009Big AlFeaturedOnly in America what a load of codswallop. The storyline was predictable and weak full of quasi religious undertones (and overtones) the acting was putrid. This movie was totally unconvincing from start to finish. As you would expect the special effects were brilliant but who would watch a film just for special effects?. This is a film made by the stupid for the stupid. Do yourself a favour and save your money.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 30 2009callumFeaturedfor the first hour or so i was absoloutely gripped to this film. the intricate story line mixed with the dark and almost gothic style that brought a new side to the usual sci-fi style. however the ending was a complete joke. i understand some people saying they enjoyed it - and thats fair enough but for the writers to dump the whole story line and go ""brilliant. aliens explain evertything"" was the complete kop out in my view. it was SUCH a dissapointment.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 27 2009WordoftheGunFeaturedSpoiler Alert I would like to say this movie did hit up in my top 10 (end of the world) type of movies. And for the idiots who didnt understand this movie heres the simple breakdown of the key parts people didnt quite understand or just didnt watch mainly the ending part there wasnt only 2 kids there was multiple ships because you cant just breed 2 kids and not have inbreeding so they had to get more kids. They took them young due to start over fresh without all the bs the world was in today Just basically wing-it from the start. Just like Adam and Eve. This movie was like a Noahs ark story with a more believable story than the bible. I didnt say I dont believe theres a god just I there is something greater just everyone has there own depiction. I guess people just want to see a face and make money off donations. Anyways this movie is a must see on a suspense scale from 1 - 10 Id say its about a 7. As of the story/plot its about a 9 ( the CGI couldve been a little better at the very end made me thought they were in toonworld lol)FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 11 2009TezzaMFeaturedWhat a load of typical American dross the film was way too dark in parts and as for Nicolas Cage well he mumbled only slightly less than Christian Bale in Terminator Salvation.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 8 2009123amyFeaturedThe film was fab The plane crash is the most amazing part in the film. i wasnt able to close my mouth. i had to go back and watch it again it was spectaculer plus the train crash AWSOME The strange people in the darkness also known as the whisper people in the film really do create the suspense. The begining was very interesting...and once you see the numbers you feel so into the film. All of it is absoloutly outstanding untill you come to the point when you find out that they are aliens well that is ok but the ending was terriable and really dissapointing. I was really looking forward to the ending because everything else had been just great. These aliens seemed to be so advanced with there technology why could they save everybody on earth or stop the suns flare from destroying the earth? just because these kids can hear some voices in their heads. And seeing them not leting the dad go with him was really upsetting. The ending could of been alright but they just had to put an adam and eve shot in the end. WHY?WHY?WHY? it totally killed the ending.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 8 2009KNFeaturedIt was not only two children taken away as some people here perceived. You see many lighting alien vehicles lifting upFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 6 2009BryFeaturedJust watched this movie tonight and loved it I did not expect the ending but it was a great twist if Nick had gone with Caleb then that would have made for a boring end but when he was saying goodbye it was so sad and made for such a good film everyone in my family agreed that it was the best movie we had seen in a long time. I dont understand why people think the ending was bad as i think if it had been how people wanted it too be then it would have been extremely boring and not emotional at all i loved everything about the film. Absoloutely amazing.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 30 2009DavidosFeaturedBought Time Out yesterday read the review for this one thought might be worth a watch went to the video shop and got it... really not too bad until about 3/4 way through but you really should have prepared me for the fact that this is clearly a Scientology propaganda film... drivel by the time it gets to the end... to those who wonder about the ""amazing"" combination of science religion and action get yourselves down to the local Scientology meeting youve found your calling.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 26 2009MisterHydeFeaturedSpoiler Content Ahead - Expect Delays My favorite part was the plane crash although being as it may it portrayed my absolute greatest fear. Aye the fear of witnessing twisted metal spiraling into its impending doom and exploding into a burst of flame is very lovely thing to witness. But Im very glad they did in such a way that I was glad to be tormented whilst they destroyed the aircraft. Anyway as comments said before me they have noted that Knowing had patterns derived from other movies with end of the world plots and aliens. To be honest however what these past movies had captured before was what set them apart from others and thus made them into such classics. I found that this movie shall I say over emulated these other movies and interwove way too many common themes? Since I do enjoy developing stories and creating original ideas I found that they butchered themselves in the writing department with an overflow of clichA(c) ideas. So my point being it needed to be more original. The most magical moment was the ending. With the easily noted CGI effects and the children giggling in the wheat fields of some planet in the far end of the universe how could anyone decline its presence on film? cough But besides what I thought was terrible my surprisingly distant related cousin Nicholas Cage did a rather good job acting and I did enjoy many elements that occurred during the movie. So it wasnt all bad. By the way can someone get me the dentist of that alien that blinded Nicholas Cage? Look at them pearly whitesFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 25 2009nickFeaturedThis movie was ridiculous i just went to all that suspense for aliens to be the answer to all the numbers1111 that is bull crap im so frusturated right now i cant beleiv this crap that was a waste of life why why whyFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 13 2009SamFeaturedI am extremely disappointed with many comments about this film particularly those people opposed to what they perceive as a religious angle. Knowing follows in a ling line of excellent science fiction film dealing with ""end of the world"" scenarios. Inevitibly these types of fims (at least the best of them) address metaphysical or spiritual issues (we are speaking here about the demise of humanity after all). This film leaves enough to the imagination for the viewer to apply his or her own beliefs to the ending. Religion is at least partly a cultural phenomenon. Whether a Buddhist Christian Jew Muslim etc. I believe all religions have the common thread of attempting to understand what lies beyond this life and dealing with realities outside our own. To me science describes the mechanizs of how the Universe works. Religion approaches the ""why"" of the universe. They are truly different sides of the same coin. I believe this film joins the spiritual with the scientific very well. That is what attracted me to the film. I think that many people were put off because such a film provides a modern context within which give the tales in scripture believability to people living in a modern environment. People ambivalent about religion are uncomfortable about this. That is too bad because they are missing much. A scientific life without spiritualism is quite empty. Ask a believer like Einstein. he would attest to this.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 13 2009Gary RidenourFeaturedThis movie made my clothes smell If the aliens were so powerful to see into the future and travel between galaxies then why didnt they just shield the Earth or turn off the flare.If they cared so much about life why did they let six billion people fry to save two kids. Who do the kids kids procreate with? No wonder it is out in DVD alreadyFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 11 2009snakeFeaturedI thought this movie was unique although the ending was not so great thats was the only thing i did not like about this movie. but nicklas cage did a fantastic job on the charter he played. so i give this movie must seeFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 11 2009NinjaFeaturedOkay well Ive read some of these comments and I have to say some of you are idiots. Those of you who say the movies ending was terrible and didnt make sense I would like to let you know if you possessed a brain youd realize that the ending was beautiful for the way the director melded religion science and spiritual beliefs in one movie. I would like to take into consideration that there are many not-so-intelligent people in this world but even with that said the movie was spectacular visually and mentally. Not a big fan of Nicholas Cage but I have to give it to the man much better than Mark Walberg in ""The Happening"". And for those of you who still disagree with the opinion that the ending of the movie was brilliant i would like to tell you one thing. I am 14 years old and I could figure out the plot and understand the ending.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 8 2009MissyFeaturedSPOILER ALERTS Theres actually people who do that God and his angels are exterrestrial- that alien is the divine.. and they can tie a lot of Biblical passages and elements of the Bible together to support that theory. The loosely touched one was the Ezekial notion. If you care to research theres a quite a few. But with any theory if you believe it enough you can find evidence in anything and make it tie together. I thought the movie was excellent because it tied multiple elements together - science religion action suspense ; however I must agree with others that they needed a different actor besides Cage. He is too predictable and drawn out. Also I agree with the comment that a plot gap was him figuring out the message but not being saved. If it was destined that the child was to be saved it would of happened regardless. I guess you couldnt make a movie just off of that alone however. The purpose of his decoding I believe was for him to meet that women and the other child but besides that null.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 2 2009JonFeaturedI dont realize the stupidity of people untill situations like these bring it out in the open. WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING IN AN APOCALYPTIC MOVIE? I found it hilarious how many people were either confused or found the ending to be terrible. My favorite quote from this comment page is ""When the plot was discovered the entire cinema groaned."" First off WOW. If you couldnt figure out the plot of this story within the first 10 seconds of the freakin trailer you must be either mentally challenged or have failed the 1st grade. Look. The old woman the prophet was predicting events that would happen were people really expecting the entire chain of events to break off for one point and have Nich pull something out of his arse and save the world? The aliens I found that they tied the alien and bible references together masterfully most directors may shy away from producing such a theory in a film. Acting wise I believe Nich did a fine normal job for him not always my favorite actor but I usually enjoy the movies he is in. Im not really sure the name of the prophets daughter but I found myself nearly screaming at my screen because of how many hollywood mistakes she made in the movie. Basically like when you are watching a horror movie where the victims walk around in complete darkness with no freakin defense. I actually laughed so hard when she died and I was overjoyed. I have seen a lot of hate comments about how the ending was bad I challenge anyone to come up with a better ending. Have everyone just die including the kids?...No because that would defeat the purpose of even having the numbers. There is no better way I would have ended the movie. Judging by the grammar and the shortness of most peoples comments on the end they are probably ignorant to all of the biblical references present. The one and only problem I had with the ending was the fact that it really didnt matter that Nich figured out the coords because he wasnt getting taken anyway. The aliens kidnapped the children without Nich even being there I found that to be a type of gap in the plot. All in all I enjoyed the film and found many clever references with a neat storyline. Amazing special effects and a GOOD ENDING. )FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 25 2009Nicholas CageFeaturedfor those saying the story was rubbish they didnt call it a sci-fi movie (based off a sci-fi book) for nothing. its just a movie - cant expect everything you see in a movie to be real can you?? The special effects were great and there was quite a bit of reference to religion. At the very end it shows references to the very first chapter in Genesis (from the Bible).FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 23 2009RuthFeaturedI loved this movie too and completely agree with Andrew and Informers reviews. I also wondered what movie were the people watching to those who didnt like it. From their comments it is obvious they dIdnt predict the whisperers being aliens ( obvious) or understand the that solar flares can anielate a planet and the Adam amp; Eve reference at the end. The fleeting Ezekial reference is a reference to how Ezekial in the bible is taken by God without dying by going up in the sky. Some people think is could have been aliens even back then. Definitely a GREAT Sci Fi with GREAT disaster effects and yes it helps if you already understand that solar flares could indeed end life as we know it (not to mention interfere with satellite communication devices - - already happening) AND I LOVE everything Nicolas Cage is in so of course that was a bonus for me.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 21 2009simonFeaturedvery disappointed good effects in the disaster scenes but overall it was boringFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 15 2009PriFeaturedOkay so I thought that the trailer looked damn good but what they dont mention in the trailer is the ending. (which is clearly where the whole movie unraveled in story line and CGI). This movie was terrible It had a good 1st half but the story started out semi-realistic and then ended up being about aliens So what if its sci-fi I wouldnt have bothered watching it if I knew it was a mix of better sci-fis. All in all not a great movie and was not worth the time or effort.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 4 2009IrFeaturedThe question that really tortures me after this movie was it sponsored by the creationists? And this overwrites it all clichA(c)d dialogues clichA(c)d scenes a too old too worn out Nicolas Cage with his too unconvincing over-dramatic stray puppy look (maybe if we hadnaEUR(tm)t seen it in the every other movie he has ever made?) Yes in the end as the world was burning down alive (oops am I not supposed to give away this part of an apocalyptic film?) I couldnaEUR(tm)t help laughing. Ridiculous. Waste of time. ThataEUR(tm)s my verdict.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 4 2009HannahFeaturedI loved this movie. Saw it and couldnt stop thinking about it. I ws full on but the plane and train had to be the best bits to me. Didnt understand the ending and was stupid but a great movie all roundFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 4 2009XanderFeaturedWHAT A MOVIE Ok this film is designed to make you think. A ""what if it COULD happen?"" scenario. The film is tailored for those of us out there with an open mind to possible scenarios. Yes it did go into some ""science jargon"" as someone previously wrote but they failed to mention that the ""jargon"" actually made sense and applied to the movie. Film lovers out there with a brain I 100% reccommend this movie. Its based on science fact mixed with hollywood glam. ""the aliens"" pat of the film. And the ""religious"" side others have referred to is a nice twist. And really it only refers to this at the end - which by the way was spectacular. Its nice to see hollywood churn out a film thats different from the rest. In the real world The family doesnt go home all singing and dancing to a ""well done you saved the world"" ending. This film is one for the DVD collection. Outstanding.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 3 2009abidFeaturedbest movie ever seenFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 3 2009wolverineFeaturedThe plot toward the end did not make much sense to me.

I thought that it was an entertaining sometimes unforgiving gruesome clever and different take on a classic sci-fi story. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish (yes I said to finish because although quite sci-fiesque what were people expecting it is after all a sci-fi movie). OK so the writer borrows from numerous other successful sci-fi movies for some of its characteraEUR(tm)s relationships and the plots of the film (I wont say what bits because that might spoil the movie for those who have not seen it or know the plot) but AI Signs The Day After Tomorrow Contact and ET were all represented but offered with a slightly different take. The rawness of the violence at times was a little difficult to watch (but thats just me) because the way it was shot pulled no punches when people died you saw them exploding in a mess of blood or being engulfed in flames but this was such a small part of the movie that it was soon forgotten and I was on the edge of my seat again looking to see what happened next. Great movie. Not an all time favourite or a classic but a damn good evening out.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 23 2009Daniel CullinaneFeaturedKnowing is quite a impressive and entertaining little thriller but with a pointless and terrible ending to the film.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 23 2009MIkeFeaturedabsolutely stupid ending.... ruined what could have been a good movie. i feel dumb after watching itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 22 2009Darren CaskerFeaturedTidy film well done until the naff ending.

It has depth and some spirituality unlike the usual transparent titillating violence that seems to prevail. It poses many questions and is not necessarily a religious film. It only seems to be religious to those people who seem think there nothing in life other than what you see. I though the acting was terrific and the story line excellent. I would certainly recommend it. It is not for you if you prefer play station game like films. Well done Nicholas Cage.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 18 2009Ray NewtonFeaturedThe worst film I have ever seen. I dont know how Nic Cage would put his name to such dribble .FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 18 2009Alessandro M SassoonFeaturedWhat could have been an interesting movie about the power of mathematical predictions became what I have concluded to be propaganda from the evangelical lobby in Hollywood. The characters at MIT are potrayed as morons all while Cage gives his concerned look for over half the film. The daughter of Lucinda is a non-character and Abby is there only to complete the picture of Adam and Eve and the garden of Eden. The alien idea could have actually worked had it not been in the blatant tasteless religious context (they even spawned wings in the end). The object of this movie was to strip the scientific explanation for things of credibility while maintaining that ""science"" and theology can co-exist. The film also seemed to be a drama-horror-thriller-action-suspense movie with sweet special effects as to invigorate young audiences into thinking its hella-awesome and that ""it makes total sense the holy bible is proved by Nicolas Cages MIT math skillzzz and there is higher power (which for some reason sits idly while the earth burns and saves just 2 kids who will populate a new world [talk about a really small gene pool])FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 17 2009JuliaFeaturedAlthough I think that Nicholas Cage is an exceptionally talented actor this movie was awful. No wait what I meant to say was that the ENDING was awful. The movie itself was very entertaining and kept you on the edge of your seat. However the aliens at the end were a joke. The movie made you think that it would end in some psychological and intelligent conclusion whereas the actual ending completely destroyed the movie. With a different ending this movie could have been one of the greatest releases in 2009. If you enjoy disappointment I would recommend this movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 17 2009TylerFeaturedThis is the worst movie in the history in the world.

If you want to know how inept the movie is...well its so inept that you may wish you were watching an M. Night Shyamalan version of the very same premise. At least Shyamalan in his dud The Happening is a compulsive audience-gooser whereas Alex Proyas (The Crow) the director of Knowing has no idea what to do between calamitous set pieces. Theres one terrifying moment (its featured in the television promos) where a jetliner comes hurtling out of a stormy sky with a nightmare suddenness that is up close and vivid. But Cage gaunt and haunted (or maybe just vacant) spends far too much time doing his antsy-perturbed thing as he tries to decipher a sheet of numerals dug up from a time capsule -- a code that foretells every global disaster of the past 50 years as well as a few that have yet to happen. As he ponders and marinates we have time to consider questions like Why in the midst of this vaguely millennial muddle does Cages prof live in a mansion thats lit like the setting for a Disney ghost story? And what are those nicely attired blond alien attaches who could be refugees from a Depeche Mode video up to? You may also wonder what Cage at this point in his career does to psych himself up for a scene in which hes driving and screaming lines like ""We have to go where the numbers want us to go"" Knowing is a trash-compactor hodgepodge of Deep Impact The Number 23 Close Encounters and The Day the Earth Stood Still. Too often though its the movie that stands still as it counts down to one of those ""mind-blowing"" digital cataclysms that dissipates the moment you walk up the aisle.

Non. Nein. Neg ative. Sept. 11 is not to be used as the setup for a cheesy disaster prophecy flick. In the fiercely ridiculous ""Knowing"" Nicolas Cage plays John a widowed MIT professor looking at a page of random digits when the series 91101 leaps out at him. Its followed by the number of people killed that day. Other disasters listed include 041995 for the Oklahoma City bombing and 022307 the day ""The Number 23"" was released. The numerals dropped into a time capsule by a disturbed little girl 50 years ago include the date location and death toll of every natural disaster in that period plus a few into the future. The next ones here so naturally John zips from Boston to Manhattan by the most logical method the Brooklyn Bridge. He knows the disaster could be anything including a plane crashing on that spot yet he thinks he has a scientific MIT-ish method for foiling danger to stand around looking for suspicious characters. Soon hes randomly chasing a guy whose crime appears to be wearing a jacket. Johns an agnostic who doesnt believe life has any meaning. ""I think s - - t just happens"" he says. I can vouch for that having seen ""National Treasure 2"" but someone is sure helping to make it happen. Like Cage who sticks to his habit of shouting punch lines like a 16-year-old at a midnight screening of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" (Example ""Im just trying to understand why THIS IS SAYING THEY WILL"") John in world-saving mode winds up in the middle of more disaster areas than Anderson Cooper. Did you know that when a plane slams into the ground at high velocity everyone on it initially survives? Yep apparently they all get out and run around yelping as they burn. Now I know why the stuntmen call these scenes ""fire gags."" Amid chatter about global warming the sinister doings of whispery figures pursuing Johns son and the secrets known only by the daughter (Rose Byrne) of the girl who originally wrote the prophecy the movie directed by Alex Proyas (""I Robot"") at least manages to keep you interested if your eardrums are in the mood for a pummeling and your eyeballs like to drink up apocalyptic images. At one point a woman on one side of me at the screening had both hands over her ears while the girl to the other side had both hands over her eyes. I felt like the speak-no-evil monkey in the middle but speak I must. The movie begins shameless grows stupid and winds up silly. If the ending had less of the air of a crackpot religion and more pretentiousness you could almost call it Shyamalanish. KNOWING Duh-saster. Running time 121 minutes. Rated PG-13 (disturbing disaster sequences brief profanity). At the E-Walk the Lincoln Square the Orpheum others.

Knowing. (PG-13) Summit (122 min.) Directed by Alex Proyas. With Nicolas Cage. Now playing in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS. Hollywood spends millions running focus groups and tracking surveys to gauge peoples interest in a movie. What a waste of money. All I have to do is tell people I have an extra ticket to a screening and see who wants to come. ""The Last House on the Left""? No interest whatsoever. ""Knowing""? Requests from the moment the trailers showed up. Thats understandable. The ads hint at a series of numbers that somehow foretell disasters. The idea feeds simultaneously on our pessimism (its the end of the world) and our optimism (but maybe we can stop it). As brought to the screen though the mix is a little less smooth. Nicolas Cage carefully coifed and strangely waxen plays a professor of astrophysics who happens to come across a sheet of numbers scribbled down 50 years ago by a strange girl. Its all gibberish of course. But then he sees a pattern. The numbers arent random. Theyre specific dates arranged chronologically. Dates of plane crashes earthquakes even the Twin Towers attacks. Followed by the precise number of casualties. And there are some very big dates just ahead. The movie unfortunately is very big too and a little lumbering as a result. This is the sort of thing that works best as a short story ""Twilight Zone"" episode or out-of-left-field sleeper like ""The Mothman Prophesies."" It needs to move quickly elusively. Director Alex Proyas however -- whose signature credits are the dead-on-arrival ""I Robot"" and the ahead-of-the-curve dark fantasy ""The Crow"" -- seems determined to be Significant. On the plus side that means at least three drop-your-popcorn disaster spectaculars -- including a New York train wreck that is going to leave commuters feeling very uneasy. On the minus side that means an uneasy blending of sci-fi and religion fate and faith -- the same mish-mash that has bedeviled most of M. Night Shyamalans recent movies and leaves this film leaden with self-importance. There are some saving graces. Cage makes a few interesting choices -- antic line readings bits of business -- that will make fans recall the long-ago days of ""Leaving Las Vegas."" He was a surprising actor before the action films took over and it would be nice to renew that acquaintance. The effects are quite wonderful -- although as the movies set in Boston it seems unfair to set at least two major scenes of destruction in Manhattan. Hasnt that city suffered enough in movies? Cant Hollywood give it a break and just beat down on Beantown for awhile? Ultimately though the movie goes on a little too long and by the time it staggers to its ending things are both unpleasantly bleak and unbelievably sentimental. Its an upbeat downer. A sermon to self-involvement too. This is like ""Signs"" one of those movies that believes that death comes to other people -- entire worlds even -- just so the hero can grow as a person. Its the Gospel According to Hollywood in which of course its always all about Me. But I bet its going to have a great opening weekend. And thats one set of numbers you dont need a strange haunted-eyed little math whiz to correctly predict. Rating note The film contains violence substance abuse and children in jeopardy.

Rose Byrne and Nicolas Cage in ""Knowing.""ROSE BYRNE and NICOLAS CAGE star in KNOWING a Summit Entertainment release. Photo Vince Valitutti PHOTO BY VINCE Summit Entertainment Movie review Knowing funny for a thriller 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Knowing Science fiction. Starring Nicolas Cage Chandler Canterbury and Rose Byrne. Directed by Alex Proyas. (PG-13. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) If you see only one bad movie this year definitely make it ""Knowing."" The first major disappointment from director Alex Proyas is a disaster movie a horror picture a ""Da Vinci Code""-style thriller and an end-of-days religious film all at once. And with all of those genres represented the film still succeeds best as a comedy. Theres something about Nicolas Cage delivering apocalyptic lines (""I can still see their faces ... burning ..."") that never stops being funny. ""Knowing"" is a disappointment for fans of Proyas who had a strong record making science-fiction films including the excellent ""Dark City."" This one isnt worthless but its a surprisingly messy effort from the director who made ""The Crow"" seem less than ridiculous. Cage is John Koestler a professor at MIT very heavy drinker and widowed father of a precocious young boy who unearths a letter filled with seemingly random numbers. Koestler figures out that the numbers are a code predicting the date location and body count of every major disaster from the past 50 years. Three more are coming. Will he be able to avert the inevitable? There are dozens of ideas in ""Knowing"" but few are adequately explored. Even the scene where Koestler breaks the code is handled with almost zero excitement. (No doubt youve had a harder time solving the Jumble.) The gaunt Cage who is known for putting an exemplary amount of effort into lousy roles (see ""Ghost Rider"") borders on ridiculous here in part because of a script that gives him little to do but freak out or act depressed. Proyas seems equally uninspired. He deserves credit for creating a pure science-fiction film with bold ideas. But the exploration of these ideas is so shallow and often so contradictory that the effort becomes patronizing. The filmmaker does succeed with most of the special effects including an amazing plane crash sequence. Less successful is a scene in the woods with animals running away from an unseen inferno. Its pretty much impossible to take the rest of a film seriously once youve seen a flaming moose running toward the camera in slow motion. -- Advisory Strong language children in peril and disaster sequences that involve combustible woodland creatures.

Night Shyamalan tossed in a heaping helping of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and written most of the cheques on his rumoured 50 million budget for CGI trickery.What are Rose Byrne and Nicolas Cage looking for? The Knowing plot?  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. March 20 2009(out of 4)Starring Nicolas Cage Rose Byrne and Chandler Canterbury. Directed by Alex Proyas. 121 minutes. At major theatres. 14A With Knowing director Alex Proyas (The Crow; I Robot; Dark City) has scooped up a little M. Night Shyamalan tossed in a heaping helping of Close Encounters of the Third Kind and written most of the cheques on his rumoured 50 million budget for CGI trickery.But it doesnt all add up to much when the end-of-days sci-fi thriller is based on a confusing plot and wonky script that careens among some stock cliches before screeching to a laughable ending. Eye candy doesnt always make for a satisfying meal.Nicolas Cage plays John Koestler a widowed astrophysics professor who hates the world but has an abiding love for the bottle. Hes struggling to raise his precocious son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) not only because he misses his wife but because John is hardly Mr. Warmth. Theres lots of ""do your homework"" talk going on. And was there ever a parent so intense?Article Continued BelowMeanwhile Calebs school is preparing to unearth a time capsule buried as a class project 50 years before. Its a metal tube filled by drawings of the future as envisioned by the 1959 pupils. Also inside is a page filled with mysterious numbers furiously scribbled by a strange child named Lucinda as she responds to frantic whisperings only she can hear.Caleb brings Lucindas page home. A late-night rendezvous with the Scotch bottle leads John to study the odd collection of numbers and start looking for clues with the help of Google and his GPS unit. It dawns that the seemingly random numbers add up to predictions of global disasters including the date and number of dead.Whipped into a scientific frenzy that owes much to Richard Dreyfuss mashed potato model-building scenes in Close Encounters John starts to investigate and the CGI floodgates open. The effects are chilling and over the top - a plane crash with a chorus line of staggering fire-engulfed victims a subway train spectacularly peeling off the rails a forest burning as tortured animals flee for their lives. John is convinced the numbers point to events in his own life and is terrified that three future sets of numbers just days hence spell disaster for his family.Along the way John finds Lucindas grown daughter (Rose Byrne pretty much wasted here) and her little girl who claims she too is contacted by the same ""whisper people"" who dictated the numbers to her Grandma Lucinda. Caleb is hearing them too - or maybe not. He wears a hearing aid but isnt deaf. Confused?And who is that weird guy who looks like Rutger Hauer in a trenchcoat who keeps hanging around in the misty shadows staring at the kids?Meanwhile John discovers this October heat wave the area is enduring is only going to get much much worse.The frustrating thing about Knowing is the story is worthy. But director Proyas tries to cram too much in as if the tricks and effects wizardry are all that really counts.

Starring Nicolas Cage Chandler Canterbury Rose Byrne Director Alex Proyas Running time 201  Editorial Review I know things. Terrible things. Shall I share them with you?No unlike John Koestler (Nicolas Cage) the hero of ""Knowing"" who comes across a 50-year-old list of numbers that somehow seems to have predicted -- down to the precise date and location -- every major disaster of the last half-century plus a few that havent happened yet I cannot see into the future. But I have seen the movie. And I can tell you thisThere will be creepy kids in it. Kids who stare off into space hear voices and have visions.There will be creepy adults in it too. Adults who lurk in the woods wear trench coats and look like Rutger Hauer circa ""Blade Runner."" (Theyre the ""whisper people"" who talk to the kids without opening their mouths.)There will be a protagonist (Cage) whose problems -- alcohol abuse the recent death of his wife -- make him sound unhinged when he tries to warn people of the coming apocalypse.There will be the discovery of a creepy room plastered with creepy old newspaper clippings.And there will be a constant and mysterious shortage of overhead lighting necessitating the frequent use of flashlights and creepy string music.Yes ""Knowing"" is creepy at least for the first two-thirds or so in a moderately satisfying if predictable way. And it nicely plays off the zeitgeist of dread about the future and our still-lingering regrets about whether -- if wed only heeded the warning signs -- we could have prevented such things as the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.But the narrative corner into which this movie directed by Alex Proyas (""I Robot"") paints itself is a simultaneously silly and morbidly depressing one.Well before the film neared its by turns dismal and ditzy conclusion I found myself knowing -- yet hardly able to believe -- what was about to happen.-- Michael OSullivanContains disturbing scenes of carnage and brief vulgar language.

Three predictions remain which becomes the task of astrophysicist widower and consequently atheistic convert John Koesler (Nicolas Cage) to prevent -- or at least try to. His son who was the recipient of the letter when it was extracted from the time capsule also seems to carry the same gift for prognostication that the author of the code did before she as an adult took her own life. This is the concept behind Knowing and I have to say its a good one. One of the better concepts Ive encountered in the past year or so too so I obviously had high hopes for the movie when I sat down to screen it. The Good ... That concept I mentioned for one. It certainly lends itself to the perfect action formula start with a great idea add clearly defined tasks deliver satisfying resolution. Hell even Hercules knew this when he set out to complete his twelve labors. Knowing also enjoys two outstanding action sequences that are arguably worth the price of admission. The first a plane crash is thrilling enough when it begins since well I like FX-laden cinematic carnage I admit it. But as conceived by director Alex Proyas it quickly deteriorates into surprisingly terrifying horror. The second a subway train crash continues to escalate -- or is that ""degrade""? -- the same way. One begins excited by the sight of a derailing train the close calls the flying shrapnel -- but it doesnt stop there. That train keeps plowing through the crowd and I mean plowing. Bodies explode against the windshield like bugs. The result is just as jarring as the plane crash aftermath with victims staggering about covered in white dust a la 9/11 as emergency teams arrive. And finally for astronomy dorks out there Koesler and his son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) reference the Drake Equation in their opening scene together. Its a small thing but I appreciated that the screenwriters all three of them went there. The Bad ... Nicolas Cage and Rose Byrne. First Cage doesnt even bother with a performance here. And by that I mean he doesnt even bother playing Nicolas Cage the Wackily Eccentric Dude he does in every other movie he appears in. A waxwork of Nicolas Cage being wacky has more life than he brought to this role. Byrne as the daughter of the girl who wrote the code is almost as bad. If youve ever seen Byrne act she basically plays a drowsy girl. Perhaps even a heavily medicated one. Who knows? Point is shes sleepwalking here. Next up the spooky-looking dudes that lurk in the forest around the Koeslers farmhouse. They all look like Spike from Buffy the Vampire Slayer but without the charm. In the middle of what seems like a sci-fi movie with religious overtones these pigment-challenged ""whisperers"" who obviously have some connection to Caleb keep showing up like supernatural horror movie extras. The Ugly ... The twist of the movie what explains the Bible the code the Spike clones and maybe even the Madea movies (okay not that last one) is so damn laughable that it makes the ending of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull seem brilliant by comparison. Despite the concept despite the relatively solid and even exciting first half the last fifteen minutes of Knowing left me squirming in my seat. Seriously. The guy next to me gave me several dirty looks because I couldnt stop moving around but thats what I do when I feel embarrassed. Embarrassed for the human race that it could produce something this stupid. Then again maybe thats why you should buy a ticket. To finally confront how far our race has devolved in the last 100 years.

ABOUT THE MOVIEKnowing 1/2 Stars Nicolas Cage Rose Byrne Chandler CanterburyDirector Alex ProyasDistributor Summit EntertainmentRating PG-13 for disaster sequences disturbing images brief strong languageRunning time 2 hours 1 minuteOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY ""If you want to believe you go ahead and believe."" Nicolas Cage speaks these words to his son about life beyond Earth. But it might as well apply to Knowings absurdly jumbled plot. If youre of a mind to believe a dreary and far-fetched thriller about numerology-crazed alien life forms then you may find the movie mildly diverting. But if you prefer an actor who has more than a couple of expressions and a story that makes sense then remain un-Knowing. Cage plays a widowed science professor with a precocious son (a lively Chandler Canterbury). The boy receives a portentous message in a time capsule buried at his school. Once the message gets into Cages hands he begins scrawling numbers on walls and growing weirdly distraught. Its increasingly hard to believe that Cage won an Oscar in 1996 (for Leaving Las Vegas). In the past decade he has made some awful choices and his range has seemed to grow more limited. Here with his lugubrious hangdog expression its hard to buy that he could be capable of saving the world. ""How am I supposed to save the world?"" he howls about an impending phenomenon that makes global warming look like an ecological hangnail. Knowing closely follows the guidebook for mystical thrillers with paranormal themes. Cliches abound. And when all else fails in this by-the-numbers numerological thriller director Alex Proyas turns up the volume of the bombastic score to 11.

(Valitutti/Summit) Joe Neumaier Thursday March 19 2009 445 PM There are things that need to be decided before going into ""Knowing."" The first is do you want to know anything about it? Another is do you mind if the filmmakers couldnt decide what they were making - an apocalyptic chiller? Disaster flick? Alien horror movie? Paranoid religious parable? If the answers are yes and no read on.This Nicolas Cage weird-a-thon throws in everything but the kitchen sink and that may be hiding in it too. The plot seems simple enough A time capsule buried by schoolchildren in 1959 included a list of numbers written by a spooky little girl who knew the dates and locations of future catastrophes. Fifty years later an astrophysicist (Cage) and his son find the note - and dad figures out its chilling meaning. Yet the 12 people who saw Jim Carreys ""The Number 23"" know numerology cant be trusted ... to provide excitement. Watching Cage - who seems disengaged but isnt as bad as he too often can be - figure out the pattern is as electrifying as watching someone do a Jumble puzzle. Soon ""Knowing"" becomes an extended ""X-Files"" episode that reaches for sci-fi relevance but just keeps getting sillier like when four mysterious guys with shiny blond hair show up looking like Rutger Hauers family reunion. This is the kind of movie where Cages academic character lectures his class and lays out the underlying theme. Oh the universe is designed or left to chance; got it. That comes before director Alex Proyas delivers very ugly images of Manhattan devastation and a disturbing airplane crash. Was there a prediction of this laughably bad movie in ""The Mothman Prophecies""?

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Where to begin? How to respond to a fiasco on the scale of ""Knowing"" the insane numerological thriller starring Nicolas Cage as an MIT prof whose scientific rationality is shaken by predictions of doom? Do you start on the micro scale with miscues and oops moments? Its hard to place much faith in a thriller where police search for a lost child in a schoolhouse by flashlight when they could just turn on the lights. Or to believe that a Boston astrophysicist would drive a globe-warming Ford F-150. Or that Cages Prof. John Koestler a boozing recent widower would be focused enough to glance at a page of tightly packed number strings from a 50-year-old time capsule and recognize the month day year and fatality toll of the World Trade Center attacks. Maybe its best to open on the macro scale challenging the storys ""Close Encounters of the Theological Kind"" premise which squanders a mysterious setup in promiscuous eruptions of sentimentality and New Age brain fog. Cribbing shamelessly from M. Night Shyamalans ""Signs"" the film gives us Cage as a rationalist who sees existence as sheer coincidence. Hes the resentful son of a pastor and what little faith he had was erased after his wife died. When Johns son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) opens a note from his schools time capsule crammed with data relating to high-fatality disasters over the past 50 years its clear that John will have to wrestle with the demons of his skepticism. The stakes are life and death because the final three clues point to imminent catastrophes. Soon menacing figures are appearing in Calebs bedroom frightening him with images of horizon-filling forest fires. Cage whose name on movie posters has become a kind of Mr. Yuk warning label acts with the grimace of a man suffering a savage stomachache. When he chases an intruder into the woods pounding his baseball bat against a tree as a warning the moment teeters from drama to unintended comedy. Its best not to be too specific about the later acts of the story except to say that a great deal of money was spent simulating global disaster. The resolution of the mysterious visitors mission and Johns crisis of faith feels more like an excuse to stage some hellacious cataclysms than the product of a genuine belief in anything at all. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Although made mostly of spare parts ""Knowing"" is a not-bad supernatural-tinged sci-fier that has more on its mind than the run-of-the-mill effects-driven extravaganza. Absorbing and able to be taken seriously most of the way Alex Proyas generally somber look at a small group of people tipped off about the imminence of doomsday doesnt smoothly synthesize all its elements and the effects could have used a budget stimulus. Genre fans always looking for something new and awesome may feel like theyve seen most of this before but the conceptual and emotional strength of Summits Nicolas Cage starrer largely carries the day which should spell sturdy B.O. in all markets. The 1959-set prologue of Ryne Douglas Pearsons original story gets its hooks in by virtue of that reliable standby a disturbingly creepy kid. Asked by their elementary school teacher to draw pictures of how they see the future to include in a time capsule all the pupils in the Boston-area school oblige except for Lucinda (Lara Robinson) a haunted-looking child who instead covers her sheets of paper with thousands of numbers. Come time to open the capsule 50 years later Lucindas inscrutable jottings land in the hands of Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) a precocious boy depressed over the recent death of his mother. Dad John (Cage) an astrophysics professor at MIT is in the dumps himself and struggling to forge a stronger bond with his son while living at a run-down old Victorian house out in the woods. At night a tired and somewhat drunk John puzzles over Lucindas numbers and shortly concludes that many of them beginning with 9/11/01 refer to calamitous incidents that involved massive loss of life; he soon thereafter learns the remaining numbers provide even more specific information. But three sets of numbers at the end of the long list lie in the future -- the very very near future. Naturally John has as much trouble convincing anyone else about his deductions as Costello ever did insisting to Abbott that Dracula and Frankenstein were alive and well. But a plane crash virtually in his backyard confirms the first remaining prediction and what he at length learns from Diana (Rose Byrne) the troubled daughter of Lucinda -- who herself has a daughter (Robinson again) whos Calebs age -- deepens and makes even more apparent the ominous nature of the numeric scribblings. That there is something truly unearthly at play is suggested by Calebs occasional sightings of the Stranger (D.G. Maloney) a silent and sinister albino-ish figure sometimes seen in the company of others who stalks the boy. Such events naturally trigger questions of what to make of it all and ever more urgently what to do about it. When John figures out the exact time and place of the second forecasted catastrophe hes forced to a wrenching decision but has sufficient knowledge -- more than anyone else on Earth in fact -- to know what to do. Unfortunately the climax consists of a special-effects fireworks display that because similar images have been conjured before with greater resources cant help but look secondhand. Although he may not fit the received image of an MIT prof Cage slimmed down to the edge of gauntness generally suppresses his more wildly emotive tendencies to deliver an acceptably thoughtful performance. Byrne has the gravity to pull off Dianas perpetual state of distress without annoyance and Canterbury and Robinson are rock-solid as the two crucial kids. Rather than just sharing his suspicions with one of his colleagues a worthwhile additional scene to the script (by Pearson Juliet Snowden and Stiles White) might have had John calling a meeting with several MIT brainiacs just to get multiple and eccentric reactions to his reading of the numbers. Lensed almost entirely in Melbourne Australia with a bit of second-unit work on the East Coast to rep Boston and New York the pic was shot by d.p. Simon Duggan with the Red One digital camera system and has an agreeably soft desaturated autumnal look. The old-dark-house central setting and threatening surrounding forest come with certain B-feature connotations that are never entirely shaken but Marco Beltramis vigorous score buttressed at key moments by Beethovens Symphony No. 7 is strictly A-level.

Johns a widower (his wife died in a hotel fire) with a young son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury). He drives his kid to school goes to work they come home eat dinner he reads Caleb a story or lets him watch TV and then John drinks himself into a stupor.But when a time capsule is opened after 50 years in the ground at Calebs school the Koestlers routine goes kablooey. Caleb brings home a paper from among the many kids drawings in the capsule a page covered front and back in numbers - the work of a scared little girl whom we see in the prologue.At first John thinks its just gibberish but then a pattern emerges numbers such as 9/11/2001 - the dates of disasters from Lockerbie to Katrina. Pretty much all the worlds major catastrophes over the last 50 years and gulp a few yet to come.Determinism to the nth power.Cage works best when hes tamped down (Leaving Las Vegas) or going at odd angles in conventional romances (Moonstruck). But left to his own devices - which director Alex Proyas seems to have done - Cage can become well simply hysterical.Its not that the situation in Knowing doesnt warrant a bit of hysteria as our hero rushes around trying to save lives. (""Why hasnt this intersection been sealed off?"" he demands of a New York cop after calculating the longitude and latitude of the next mass tragedy.) Its just that theres something at once annoying and absurd in Cages demeanor - no wonder Rose Byrne as a single mother with ties to the time-capsule girl is freaked out when she meets him. (It doesnt help that hes been stalking her.)Knowing has about a half-dozen screenwriter credits which may explain why scenes crash up against one another - smart stupid far-fetched compelling. And the trouble is that Cage walks (or runs) through them all treating each with the same level of intensely goofy seriousness.Proyas of I Robot and The Crow stages a couple of breathtaking disasters a passenger jet slashing sideways onto a traffic-jammed Boston highway a subway train rocketing off its tracks onto a platform in lower Manhattan. But his attention to detail borders on - no crosses over to - the morbid.As for Knowings ending well it would be irresponsible for me to discuss. But Ill say this It borrows from L. Ron Hubbard the Rapture Index and a mess of apocalyptic sci-fi movies - quite a few of which are vastly more interesting and more fun.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

You have no idea. The stars latest ""Knowing"" starts off mildly ridiculous ascends to the full-blown ludicrous and finally sails boldly off the edge of the absolutely preposterous. Throughout it all Cages grim sense of purpose stays in place as does his hairpiece. You have to admire such dedication amid apocalypse even as youre hooting through your fingers in disbelief.Based on the trailers ""Knowing"" at first glance appears to be an amalgam of Cages last few movies mixing the numerology games of the family-friendly ""National Treasure"" series with the future-tense prophecies of last years dud thriller ""Next."" Trust me though Where this movie goes you do not want to take a child along.Cage plays a Boston-area astrophysicist and single dad named John Koestler - works at MIT lives in Lexington - whose young son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) retrieves an odd document from an unearthed time capsule at his elementary school. The sheet is nothing but a series of numbers but John sees meaning in the randomness deducing that the 50-year-old piece of paper has correctly predicted every major disaster between then and now down to the dates number of victims and geographical coordinates. Three more disasters are yet to come. The last one looks like a biggie.This knowledge allows Cage to dash around the Eastern seaboard desperately trying to confirm his fears and convince others. An MIT colleague (Phil Beckman) and a young mother (Rose Byrne) - the daughter of the girl who wrote the sheet a half-century ago - are initially skeptical but too many weird things are going on. Who are those creepy figures standing outside Johns house at night and what are they telepathically whispering to his son?The director is Alex Proyas who made a name for himself with the visual stylistics of ""The Crow"" ""Dark City"" and ""I Robot."" The mans not a hack. ""Knowing"" takes itself so seriously that its hard not to get the giggles but then Proyas comes through with a breathtaking single-take sequence in which John watches a commercial airliner plummet to earth yards away and runs into the flaming wreckage searching for survivors. The same goes for a terrifying NYC subway crash which the director choreographs as a catastrophic you-are-there experience.Unfortunately the films human interactions are pitched at the same constant white-knuckle level - Cage has never seemed so stiffly absent - and Proyas keeps everyone jumping over plot holes. At times ""Knowing"" feels like the highlight reel for a longer but much less silly movie.The story line keeps getting wider and wider in its implications and at a certain point you realize its fearlessly going all the way into - well the Book of Revelation would make a handy study guide. ""Knowing"" works itself up into a thundering sci-fi/Christian metaphor in which both sides have equal weight and it will be taken as oh-wow gospel by impressionable young audiences and those who believe (as this movie does) that were all sinners except the kids. That audience may be quite happy to see Manhattan at last get what they think it deserves.Proyas is a real filmmaker though and ""Knowing"" rockets along with urgency if not realism or even common sense. At its lunatic best the films a version of ""The Happening"" in which something actually happens. At its worst its a bad-movie rapture.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Isnt it cheating to cast Nicolas Cage as a man trying to warn everyone else that the worlds going to end? In these later years of Cages career a bug-eyed expression suggesting that everyone around him has gone insane has become his default mode. If anyone ever wanted to make a story about the prophet Jeremiah hes their man. But what Cage doesnt do convincingly anymore if he ever did is act normal. By the time Knowing the latest thriller from Alex Proyas (Dark City; I Robot) rolls around to its apocalypse-now second half Cage is in the zone. Its the early scenes in which he has to play a hard-drinking coldly logical astrophysicist grieving his dead wife while raising a son (Chandler Canterbury) that make him look like a weirdo. When Canterbury helps open a time capsule at his elementary school Cages logic is put to the test. Unearthing a sheet of paper covered in numbers scrawled by a doomed girl in 1959 first the son then his father suspect it might hide a code. After a whiskey-soaked night circling numbers Cage comes away convinced that the digits have predicted every disaster of the last 50 years and a few yet to come. At this point Cages performance and the film around him go a little nuts in ways its difficult to talk about without spoiling what comes next. This detail should suffice Canterbury is pursued by black-clad Aryan-types he dubs ""Whisper People."" Or maybe this one Cage is required to run around like a madman trying to prevent the disasters to come. Then theres this Cage delivers a lecture about cosmic determinism vs. randomness but hes stuck in a rigidly deterministic script in which nearly every line doubles as foreshadowing. So pay attention to some early concern about Cages atheism and estrangement from his minister father. Knowing frequently feels one Revelation quote away from turning into a chiding fundamentalist-friendly end-of-the-world movie in the Left Behind mold. Instead the film lets viewers read those damning verses between the lines.

Having spent time squatting while being raised by a single mom Webber has been an outspoken activist against urban poverty thus his all-star indie cast tends to serve as collective mouthpiece for his lefty politics. The lived-in performances include Lou Taylor Pucci as the artist who has to sell pot to survive Paul Dano as a struggling actor battling the melancholia of an unhelpful world Rosario Dawson as the working-class mother of a young asthmatic (newcomer Francisco Burgos a tad too precocious for his own good) and Tariq ""Black Thought"" Trotter as Jimmy Fallons new house-band emcee -- but also a vegan entrepreneur. Executive-produced by Jim Jarmusch and lensed with luminous saturation by Patrice Lucien Cochet the film is confidently polished and thankfully more sweet-tempered than preachy given that every narrative thread has an underlying theme of social injustice. As it leads up to a neighborhood-wide rally that brings every character together its a shame that Webber (in a marching cameo) has already surrendered his drama over to a last-act tragedy (povertys fault of course). For that I too protest. (Sunset 5) (Aaron Hillis) GO  THE GREAT BUCK HOWARD No one does raging unlovability quite like John Malkovich whos a total gas when he drops the bombast that often bogs down his more serious roles. Not that Buck Howard the once-great mentalist now playing to half-empty theaters in Hicksville lacks for pathos -- or for glory. His lounge act is excruciating his standup terrible but his one gift locating his paycheck in the clothing of an audience member has never let him down -- until now it goes without saying. Based on a magician known to writer-director Sean McGinly this loudly dressed insecure blowhard with a pumping handshake and severe anger-management problems may also be an ambivalent tribute to Jerry Lewis. Either way Malkovich swallows up the screen and when hes out of frame the movie feels slack and slow. Hobbled by lack of definition Bucks assistant and McGinlys alter ego Troy (Colin Hanks) a law school dropout with dreams of writing comes across as pallid and passionless while the talents of Emily Blunt as a go-getting publicist and Steve Zahn as a small-town fan go wretchedly to waste. While it laments our decaying faith in magic and mystery The Great Buck Howard is rarely mawkish. McGinly sheds no tears for this clown and he makes a beguiling case for following your bliss all the way to Bakersfield if thats where it lies. (The Landmark; Sunset 5; Playhouse 7) (Ella Taylor)KNOWING Carefully coded so as not to scare away secular audiences who just wanna see stuff blow up this lugubrious thriller is still the closest Hollywood has come to addressing the question What would a Christian Apocalypse movie look like with a big budget a talented director and star power of higher wattage than a discount Baldwin brother? Here comes the answer like a glum hybrid of the Final Destination movies an Irwin Allen disaster bash and the kitschiest parts of Darren Aronofskys The Fountain. Nicolas Cage plays a widowed scientist who discovers that the time capsule his kid brought home from school is actually a numerically coded map to 50 years of calamities -- essentially prophecy from the Book of the Number 23. The template has changed little since the Mark IV Rapture shockers and Ron Ormond Christploitation epics that traumatized church youth groups in the 1970s Disbelievers will get face time with Revelation undergo a foxhole conversion realize their pastor father was right all along etc. -- but by then itll be too late. What has changed significantly is the expense of the scare tactics. I Robot director Alex Proyas helming a project once meant for Donnie Darkos Richard Kelly withholds and deploys his show-stopping CG catastrophes with unseemly zeal Its hard to take the movies high-minded talk about determinism seriously with p.o.v. shots of human bugs splattering on a subway windshield. By the time winged messengers arrive from on high one longs for the hardheaded heresy of Michael Tolkins The Rapture. (Citywide) (Jim Ridley)MISS MARCH ""Thats four years worth of poop"" a doctor remarks when Eugene (Zach Cregger) -- who wakes up from a coma after his best friend Tucker (Trevor Moore) wallops him with a baseball bat only to discover that his virginal highschool sweetheart is now a Playboy centerfold -- voids his bowels. Miss March which Whitest Kids U Know Cregger and Moore also co-wrote and co-directed sprays like an exploding colostomy bag for 89 minutes. Only a moron would expect a dude road-trip-sex comedy to be more than an aggressive expression of male sexual anxiety. But really when did women become such vile creatures that they must be stabbed in the face with a fork after a botched blowjob become near roadkill and drink dog pee (and love it)? To make assholes respect you ladies try this Become a Bunny to pay your vegetable boyfriends medical bills while saving yourself to have sex with him or a Slavic lesbian who ingeniously transforms a Perrier bottle into a dildo. Hugh Hefner shows up to give an addled lecture after Eugene and Tucker make it to the Playboy Mansion and you think Wasnt it just last summer that he so sweetly played himself in The House Bunny?

Sep. 13 600pm GO  PERESTROIKA On the evidence of his new movie Slava Tsukerman who made the 1982 cult movie Liquid Sky would make a brilliantly entertaining dinner guest. The Russian writer-director who thrives on confusion has emptied the contents of his very busy head and heart into this crowded talky but immensely likable movie about almost everything in a rapidly changing uncertain postperestroika world. Tsukermans test case for this modest ontological inquiry is a post-Soviet alter ego named Sasha Greenberg played strong and silent by Sam Robards who returns in 1992 to his beloved Moscow from self-imposed exile to take in the shock of the new. An astrophysicist who left Russia a traitor and returns a hero poor Sasha is torn between America and Russia between science and morality and between the four satellite women (Ally Sheedy snippy as ever plays his wife) who complicate his inner life. Adding to the overstuffed ambiance is a blithely experimental way with form that will keep you busy separating past from present as Tsukerman ruefully notes the durability of Russian anti-Semitism with or without regime change. His aphoristic screenplay (""Sometimes the price of freedom is collapse"") may sometimes gild the lily but the amused tenderness with which he treats his hero -- if thats the word for such a porous fellow -- and every other blitzed soul in his orbit is completely beguiling. (Sunset 5) (Ella Taylor)SIN NOMBRE Before setting pen to paper Sin Nombre writer-director Cary Joji Fukunaga purportedly rode the rails in the company of real illegal immigrants traveling from Mexico to the U.S. But from the looks of it he spent even more time studying Brazilian director Fernando Meirelless slicked-up slum porn City of God diminutive kids with guns -- check; carefully lit and art-directed shantytowns -- check; doomed teen romance -- yep that too. In fairness Fukunagas film isnt quite as ostentatiously vulgar as Meirelles Its loftier aspirations are obvious from the opening shot of El Casper (Edgar Flores) a young initiate in the fact-based Mara Salvatrucha gang staring fixedly at a photo enlargement of a leafy wooded landscape -- a signal flare (along with his teardrop tattoo) that hes really a soulful poet-dreamer trapped in a violent existence. After his girlfriend is raped and murdered by the gangs more elaborately tattooed leader Casper makes a break for it hopping the same U.S.-bound freight train on which Honduran teen Sayra (Paulina Gaitan) and her father are heading to the promised land. Meanwhile Caspers best friend Smiley (pint-sized Kristian Ferrer) is dispatched to track the fugitive down -- hmmm do you think these two amigos will find their personal loyalty tested by obeisance to La Mara? Lushly photographed and meticulously sound-designed Sin Nombre is visceral without being vital researched without ever seeming lived-in. The best that can be said is that its a more honest film on the subject of immigration than the recent Crossing Over -- but then again so is Beverly Hills Chihuahua. (ArcLight Hollywood; The Landmark; Monica 4-Plex) (Scott Foundas)SUPER CAPERS The geeks who came of age thrilling to blockbusters like the original Star Wars trilogy and Back to the Future are settling into contented adulthood and the joys of child-rearing. But just as George Lucas recently unleashed The Clone Wars as a way to lure his fans progeny into his lair so too does writer-director Ray Griggs juvenile Super Capers target the next generation hoping that kids will be interested in a witless send-up of pop-culture detritus like light sabers Batmobiles and ""Hasta la vista baby."" The film concerns Ed Gruberman (Justin Whalin) a mild-mannered do-gooder with dreams of being a superhero despite his lack of any discernible powers who befriends a group of burgeoning caped crusaders. In the revolting tradition of Superhero Movie and Fanboys Super Capers isnt so much a filmed entertainment as it is a patchwork of ""Hey remember this movie?"" references separated by plot machinations so torturous you start to long for the mind-numbing familiarity of the parody sequences. Wielding dopey humor and a vaguely pro-Christian message Griggs seeks to create a family-friendly kids film that pays homage to the comic-book and sci-fi movies of his childhood. But considering how moldy its satirical targets are Super Capers will probably just convince young people that what their parents loved sucks. (AMC Broadway; Mann Chinese 6) (Tim Grierson) GO  TOKYO Does anyone remember Japan? The tri-part Tokyo revisits the Land of the Lost Decade -- or at least its largest city -- courtesy of tourist filmmakers Michel Gondry and Leos Carax plus South Korean neighbor Bong Joon-Ho. Mutants abound as each episode trips the light fantastic. Gondrys opening ""Interior Design"" is a vaguely Jarmuschian hipster entertainment about an aspiring filmmaker and his slacker girlfriend who arrive in Tokyo and immediately succumb to the inexplicable hassles of metropolitan life -- with the girlfriend making the more radical adaptation. ""Interior Design"" evokes Gondrys pet distinction between animate and inanimate in Japanese terms; ""Merde"" the first Carax film of the 21st century is a more confrontational riff on the most celebrated of Japanese monsters. Carax regular Denis Lavant emerges from a Tokyo manhole -- barefoot and green-clad with one milky eye and a crooked red beard -- and accompanied by a pastiche of Akira Ifukubes Gojira score staggers through the garish yet orderly Ginza grabbing eating smoking and licking alarming pedestrians (when theyre not documenting his antics on their cell phones). Dubbed the ""Creature From the Sewer"" by deadpan newsreaders who link him to al Qaeda Aum Shinrikyo and Siberian witchcraft this chaotic eruption is shown to embody Japans historical repressed as well as Europes guilty conscience. The creature discovers a subterranean memorial to the Heroes of Nanking and launches an even more destructive attack; captured and put on trial hes defended by a French lawyer with a matching milky eye who translates the creatures squeaky-voice nattering about his god. As much a form of performance art as a movie ""Merde"" offers the funniest urban rampage since Bongs The Host. Bongs own ""Shaking Tokyo"" is a quieter monster movie that addresses hikikomori a specifically Japanese form of agoraphobia in which a young person retreats into his or her room sometimes for years. A love story (possibly involving a robot) its the anthologys least flashy filmmaking but the truest to its location -- lugubrious a bit sentimental and hopeful that Japan will again emerge from its shell. (Nuart) (J. Hoberman) GO  VIRTUAL JFK This elegantly constructed if misleadingly titled class lecture written and delivered by Brown professor of international relations James G. Blight and directed by a former student Koji Masutani asks the question Can an individual leader take a nation to or keep it from war? The conclusion Individual temperament matters and John F. Kennedys example proves it. Professor Blight an associate of Kennedy defense secretary Robert McNamara argues that Kennedys 1000-day reign was basically one continuous crisis -- with Cuba Berlin and Indochina as a cycle of blinking flashpoints. Kennedy was traumatized by the Bay of Pigs debacle and was thereafter per Blight the most pressured president in U.S. history. Regarded by the military brass as a ""young punk"" and taunted by Republican opponents as a wimp Kennedy was put to the test six times and each time successfully avoided armed confrontation with the Soviets -- at odds not only with the Pentagon but also his own advisers. As Wilsons Ghost a treatise on idealism and American foreign policy which Blight wrote with McNamara was haunted by Kennedys ghost so Virtual JFK conjures the specter of George W. Bush. Theres no need to raise the question of whether Al Gore would have responded to 9/11 by going to war in Iraq. Upon its release in New York last September Virtual JFK seemed a virtual paid political ad for Barack Obama. (Music Hall) (J.

"Knowing | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; knowing ) Knowing (United States 2009) March 18 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Knowing is a classic case of a movie that is crammed with interesting ideas but is unable to conceptualize them in a compelling fashion. Knowing doesnt fail because of a lack of ambition or scope but because of flaws in execution. The movie tries to accomplish a lot of things but it doesnt do many of them well. The structure is confused with a setup that is long and uninvolving a middle section that is largely unnecessary and an ending that is rushed. There are numerous red herrings; in fact the first 90 minutes could be classified as such. The allegorical conclusion is also disappointing mainly because it is anticlimactic. As cinematic failures go at least this one is interesting in some aspects but not to the degree that I can recommend it. The film opens with a prologue set in 1959 at a Massachusetts elementary school. A time capsule is buried on school grounds with the view that it wont be opened until 2009. Each student is asked to submit a drawing depicting their idea of what the world will look in 50 years. Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson) is hearing voices and they instruct her regarding what she should put on her sheet a seemingly random series of numbers. A half-century later once the capsule is opened that sheet comes into the possession of Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) who shows it to his astrophysicist father John (Nicolas Cage). John becomes obsessed by the paper and determines that its a ""crib sheet"" listing all of the major disasters that have occurred over the past 50 years date death latitude longitude. Three future catastrophes are listed and John is obsessed with trying to prevent these to the point where he tracks down Lucindas daughter Diana (Rose Bryne) and granddaughter Abby (Lara Robinson doing double duty) in the hope that they can somehow help. Meanwhile mysterious strangers watch John and Caleb from afar whispering in the night. For a while Knowing touches on some interesting ideas including questions about fate chance and predestination. Theres also the concept of numbers forming the ultimate underlying foundation of the universe - a belief that is shared by some mathematicians and mystics alike. Unfortunately although the screenplay spends an inordinate amount of time with numerology and questions of whether the future can be known or predicted these elements dont have a lot to do with the narratives final trajectory. They are tangential obfuscations - ways to misdirect the audience and make the resolution ""surprising."" The director is Alex Proyas whose previous efforts include The Crow Dark City and I Robot. Knowing represents the weakest script he has worked on to date. He squeezes some atmosphere from it (not unlike that which permeated The Crow and Dark City) and there are some generally creepy moments involving the strangers in the woods (recalling Dark City) but all these aspects accomplish is to make the film seem like less of a time-waster. The disaster sequences are effectively staged although the heavy reliance upon CGI is evident. The train crash for example is less convincing than something similar in Die Hard with a Vengeance. Knowing also concludes with a needlessly spectacular effects sequence where something simpler and less ostentatious might have been more poignant. Theres a sense that characters often act in certain ways for no reason other than thats what the script needs. For example theres a scene in which John races to the projected disaster site in New York City and starts yelling at a random cop that the area needs to be cordoned off. This is followed by a silly chase lots of special effects and ultimately no ramifications. The point of the scene is to give us a close-up view of the crash but its a complete throw-away. The character of Diana is introduced awkwardly and no attempt is made to integrate her into the story in a meaningful manner. And the leap of logic made by John regarding a field trip to the elementary schools basement (which results in him extracting a door) is the kind of thing that would make Sherlock Holmes envious. The titters heard from the audience during this scene are reasonable. Nicolas Cage is in manic pseudo action hero mode which is fine except that he never radiates much in the way of humanity. We recognize that John loves his son because we are told that by the screenplay not because Cage sells it. The character never feels fully formed but its possible that a lot of stuff got left on the cutting room floor. (Knowing feels like a much longer movie that was gutted to trim it down to two hours.) Rose Byrne channels Jennifer Connelly; its easier to empathize with her than with Cage. Fortunately the film doesnt try to force a romance where one would not be appropriate. Because its not a run-of-the-mill dumb disaster movie Knowing proves to be more frustrating than simplistic fare like Independence Day or Armageddon. There is potential here for something thought-provoking viscerally exciting and ultimately transcendent. But there are too many problems with the script for Proyas to develop things to the point where we can see more than the skeleton of a missed opportunity. Science fiction fans will feel gypped disaster movie fans will appreciate about 10 minutes of screen time and be bored by the rest and no one else will care. The marketing campaign will put a few butts in seats but its hard to imagine many of those viewers being satisfied on any level. Someone should have known better.

Knowing Director Alex Proyas. Cast Nicolas Cage Chandler Canterbury Rose Byrne. Rating Rated PG-13 for disaster sequences disturbing images and brief strong language. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Cage keeps his cool for Knowing TV role enables Rose Byrne to make Knowing Movies about the apocalypse Nics back flicks The movie begins as a surprisingly good mystery with supernatural elements devolves into an adventure that you wouldnt rush out to see but might stick with if you caught it while channel-surfing cable before finally giving up the ghost as a special-effects-laden sci-fi head-scratcher. Its a shame really as director Alex Proyas gets a better performance out of Nicolas Cage than weve seen in ages. But ""Knowing"" eventually collapses under the weight of its ever-changing story. Cage plays John Koestler an M.I.T. professor of astro-physics whose wife died in a hotel fire. That leaves him as a devoted single parent to his son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) but shut off from the rest of the world. Only his friend and colleague Phil (Ben Mendelsohn) has much luck engaging him. A time capsule is opened at Calebs school and each student is given an envelope children placed inside 50 years ago. Caleb winds up with a sheet of paper with a seemingly random series of numbers while everyone else gets a drawing of a spaceman or robot or some other view of the future. As weve seen in flashbacks an odd little girl (Lara Robinson) obsessively wrote the numbers. By chance Cage discovers an odd fact in one series of the numbers the date of the 9/11 attacks and the number of victims. Fueled by whiskey and a sudden curiosity he manages to calculate from the sheet every disaster of the past 50 years and the number of its victims. And there are three still to come. Meanwhile Caleb is visited by a spooky silent man in a black coat with spiky blond hair who gives him a black rock. Its all very creepy satisfyingly so. Then John decides that he must prevent the disasters and were suddenly in a disaster film complete with huge loud crashes and explosions. It turns out that while John isnt able to prevent much he is able to at least be present for a couple of massive tragedies proving to him that the numbers are indeed a reliable predictor. He enlists the aid of Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne) the daughter of the girl who wrote down the numbers in the first place. Shes understandably suspicious at first but comes around and wants to help John get to the bottom of the mystery. Some snooping around in her late mothers remote trailer leads them to believe that the next disaster is far worse than they feared. From there ""Knowing"" becomes a full-on science-fiction film about which it is almost impossible to say more without giving away too much. And while the conclusion might - might - have been more satisfying in a different context which is to say in a movie it belonged in here its just weird. For all that Cage is quite good with Canterbury and when he is wrestling with the numbers and his own demons late at night. Hes good in the first third of the film in other words. When it turns into an action film he returns to more familiar turf of late; by the end of the movie he seems as surprised as the rest of us.

"Knowing Nicolas Cage and numerology - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Knowing -- 1 out of 5 stars A scene from Knowing Summit Entertainment A scene from Knowing A scene from Knowing (Summit Entertainment) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic ""I KNOW HOW THIS SOUNDS"" Nicolas Cage has occasion to repeat this line time and again in Knowing an apocalyptic blend of sci-fi horror and faith that is almost certain to be the most harrowing hooey you see in a theater this year. ""Harrowing"" because director Alex Proyas (I Robot; Dark City) and his effects team know how to stage calamities. And ""hooey"" because this is basically a cinematic defense of numerology the practice of finding meaning in numbers that might to the rest of us appear random.Cage plays John Koestler an M.I.T. astrophysicist whose son comes home with a slip of paper he took from a newly opened time capsule. Its covered with numbers. And dad drinking to forget his dead wife starts to see patterns in the numbers ""09112996."" Thats 9/11 and the death toll from the Sept. 11 attacks written on a piece of paper by a haunted little girl whose work ended up buried beneath a school 50 years ago.""Stay with me"" the professor tells a colleague (Ben Mendelsohn). ""I KNOW HOW THIS SOUNDS.""He breaks the code sees other disasters in sync with other numbers. And then he finds the dates of disasters that havent happened yet. He seeks the child who wrote the note. She died still flinging prophecies around so he settles on her daughter Diana (Rose Byrne). Koestler makes his approach.""I know how this sounds"" Koestler frantically heads to places where accidents will happen -- spectacular horrific crashes that will knock you back in your seat. Can he change the future?Meanwhile the son (Chandler Canterbury) is hearing ""The Whispering People."" So is Dianas daughter. Theyre being stalked by silent pale men in black trenchcoats who leave black pebbles as calling cards.""I know how this sounds""The five-writer script sucks in Biblical prophecy a nonbeliever son estranged from his preacher dad and the threat of End Times transforming this screwy thriller into a Left Behind with a budget.But Cage bless him sells this material. As off-the-wall as Knowing gets he never lets us see him doubt what hes playing. His chemistry with the kid isnt good -- the boy is not the most convincing child actor. Proyas doesnt appear to have given the kid enough takes to give a convincing line reading.And you can fault the director for shooting too much script. The dizziness of it all might not have been so obvious had we not had a long prologue and a finale that climaxes with two or three anti-climaxes a couple of them laugh-out-loud silly. That should have been obvious in the cutting room.But then maybe he didnt know how it sounded.
