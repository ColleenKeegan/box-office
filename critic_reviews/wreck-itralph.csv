A wordless black-and-white romance combining hand-drawn and computer animation techniques its a graceful fusion of twenty-first-century wizardry and old-school Disney warmth. By contrast the Mouse House manages only half that equation in Wreck-It Ralph a fluorescent funride through an imagined arcade game universe that bludgeons the viewer with cleverness and state-of-the-art nostalgia but is found rather wanting in the charm department.The premise might seem alien to anyone younger than Sonic the Hedgehog. Ralph (John C Reilly) is the building-demolishing antagonist of a rudimentary 8-bit video game in the Donkey Kong vein. Yearning to be a hero he sets forth into the complex inner universe of the arcade to find an alternative game that can cast him differently. But he finds himself mired in the hot-pink purgatory of girly go-kart race Sugar Rush Speedway where he joins forces with fellow outcast Vanellope (the delightful Sarah Silverman) to play the system at its own game as it were. Theres a lot more than that to this rule-ridden story world but the initial excitement of the films zigzagging between artificial environments soon becomes exhausting particularly with so little human feeling to underpin the dazzling spectacle. Disneys found a lot to play with here but you may find yourself itching to take the controls.

FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 23 2013TREGGLE2000FeaturedThis film was pure excellence I saw it the other day and it blew me away it has lots of copyright things that make it better but it wasnt as good as I was told it was. Sonic is in it for 5 seconds and so is bowser and PAC-MAN so dont get excited about that part but overall it is a very good film and touching in one or two parts it is definitely a great family film. If you are not sure about watching it in the cinema or buying it when It comes out on DVD I will leave it up to you because its is a 50/50. 3.5 starsFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 9 2013JamesFeaturedBeing a student animator I look forward to seeing just about every new animated feature film (with the exception of Hotel Transylvania) and the fact that games have had quite a heavy bearing on my life would assume that this movie should have ticked crossed and dotted all my boxes. It does however fall a bit flat. There is an enormous amount of potential (managing to aquire all the rights for games characters mustve been no mean feat) but its focus on a somewhat shallow relationship between a (good) bad guy and his quirky side kick pulls the movie away from areas that would have been better explored. Again the animation is top drawer as is the rendering and their new techniques into subsurface scattering and transluscent shaders are there for all to see. It is just a shame that in their attempt to stay away from using the game characters to sell the movie and focus on characters that dont have much weight as they couldve help create a story that is at time uninteresting. It lacks the wit that weve come to expect from the writers and developers at Pixar. Were so used to seeing quirky yet believable worlds that when its easy to get dissapointed when it isnt done as well as it should be especially with a movie of such potential. It felt as though these characters lived in this world but never belonged there. This may have been counter balanced by the story but unfortunately that left a lot to be desired. As it never played on the characters or the world as much as it couldve it was up to the narrative to make amends but it never really gets going. There is a few times when you know there is supposed to be a connection between the two main characters but it never fully materialises and it ends before you ever get a chance to bond with them. Paperman alone was worth the price of a ticket. Wreck it Ralph for me was just a welcome bonus.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 9 2013IanFeaturedAgree with the review virtually word for word. Paper man is excellent the main film not so good. Perhaps I am being a bit cynical but it does have the feel of a corporate promo about it. In days gone by Disney would have done so much more with this. Enough to keep the kids happy but for me it seems to ladle on the schmaltz and cliches just a little too much.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 16 20130 of 1 found helpfulJustin BerkoviFeaturedThe first time EVER Ive agreed with a TIME OUT review of a film Wreck it Ralph has some great ideas - what impressed me a lot was the 8 bit type animation of some of the characters I loved that. Some of the animation and effects were also very well done. However Time Out hits the main problem with the film here - the complete lack of emotional engagement between us and the characters. It just doesnt get you the way something like Pixars incredible Ratatouille does. After a while all the bright colours and explosions just tend to bore and the formulaic ending and final attempt at pulling the heartstrings just doesnt get it right. Not bad but not really one of the greats. And yes the short film at the beginning is magical.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/wreck-it-ralph,200,wreck-itralph0,wreck-itralph,timeout
"Wreck-It Ralph Review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Wreck-It Ralph Fun runs out of quarters  1/2November 01 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie critic""Wreck-It Ralph"" the exhaustingly dazzling new Walt Disney Animation Studios feature qualifies as the most manic baby sitter in town clever and detailed in its kaleidoscopic depiction of the private lives seething resentments and yearning dreams of video game characters both ""Donkey Kong"" retro and ""Call of Duty"" modern.Certainly 2012-era moviegoers of a certain age who blew a fair number of hours playing ""Donkey Kong"" or ""Centipede"" (I liked ""Centipede"" for the richness of the character development alone) represent a ripe market segment for ""Wreck-It Ralph.""But theres enough firearms fetishism and splattery violence on display to interest preteen gamers whose adult guardians are stupid enough to let them agitate their nervous systems with M-rated first-person shooter games. (I am one of those parents.) Also the film visits a ""Candyland""-inspired game world evoking a female-driven unofficial sequel to the Disneys ""Cars"" and ""Cars 2."" This movie cant lose.The storys nominal arcade setting as critic Eric Kohn observed recently in an Indiewire review already marks ""Wreck-It Ralph"" as a period piece a trip back to the days when kids didnt hunker down in a dark basement and kill recreationally while in physical isolation.Our antihero is the title character the adversary in a herky-jerky eight-bit 1982-era arcade game called ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" Wreck-It Ralph is weary of his prescribed lot in life He destroys so that the arcade customers controlling Felix Jr. can rebuild. Hes not a bad guy he figures. So why is he the bad guy?Through the dense convolutions of the script the Hulk-like hulk teams up with a snark-filled digitally glitchy heroine Vanellope von Schweetz as he strives for victory in battle in the bug-infested shooter game ""Heros Duty"" (theres a gold medal he wants to win). Meantime the anime-styled Vanellope prepares to enter the ""Sugar Rush Speedway"" rally up against a passel of mean girls who want nothing to do with a ""glitch.""Were in ""Toy Story"" territory here with more than a dash of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" as the gaming worlds collide and mix it up with often sinister results. The movie asks the question What happens to the video game characters we know and love when were not calling the shots? John C. Reilly makes an apt and expressive Ralph; Jack McBrayer from ""30 Rock"" puts the ""gee"" in ""gee-willikers"" as can-do Felix; Jane Lynch is tougher than granite as the ""Heros Duty"" commander; Sarah Silverman is better than her material as Vanellope.I found the first 30 minutes of ""Wreck-It Ralph"" a lot of fun the second and third 30 minutes progressively more routine. Also I found the crucial friendship between Ralph and young Vanellope to be a sketchy thing crowded by too much head-bonking slapstick (with weirdly realistic sound levels) and a formidable array of visual worlds competing for attention.The cleverest and best idea in ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is the simplest the notion of Reagan-era eight-bit characters guided by variations on stop-motion animation while the newer creations such as the Lara Croft-esque ""Heros Duty"" protagonist photorealistically maneuver through whatever world shes in at the time. Directed by Rich Moore (""The Simpsons"") and written by Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee the movie imparts an insular ""Tron""-y claustrophobia with all its talk and imagery involving coding and power surges. Youll either love it or youll admire it while wishing it would calm down and I dont know maybe pick up a book for a while.For some of us the highlight will be the beguiling opening animated short a late-1940s-set romance titled ""Paperman"" taking place in a black-and-white urban wonderland (with a smidge of red). And what do you know? The kids at the screening the other night applauded it.mjphillipstribune.comWreck-It Ralph -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG (for some rude humor and mild action/violence)Running time 141 MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesVideo game world built for Wreck-It RalphOctober 31 2012Comic-Con 2012 Twilight Breaking Bad The Hobbit...July 4 2012Find More Stories AboutWalt Disney Animation StudiosWreck-it RalphShooter GameTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-11-01/entertainment/sc-mov-1030-wreck-it-ralph-20121101_1_wreck-it-ralph-fix-it-felix-video-game-characters,200,wreck-itralph1,wreck-itralph,chicagotribune

Its a licensers wet dream (many favorite games are name-checked here) and it initially makes for some reasonably entertaining antics as well thanks in part to the vocal efforts of John C. Reilly. The actor has always been good at playing the proverbial bull in a china shop a guy whose awkward klutzy frame betrays his soft somewhat dim personality. As you might expect hes more of a physical force this time visually rendered in a mixture of high-end modern CGI and the retro-cubist stylings of the classic arcade games of yore. But at heart hes still the old softy. Ralph has been smashing things for three decades and he joins a ""Bad-Anon"" meeting to commiserate with his fellow video-game villains (including the ghost from Pac-Man) over his life choices. A short-tempered but ultimately kind-hearted lug who destroys things in order for his nemesis Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) to repair them Ralph decides that he might be able to gain newfound respect in the eyes of his video games inhabitants the Nicelanders if he can gain a medal elsewhere in the arcade. So he travels into a first-person shooter and then into a stylized racing game where he finds himself first at odds and then allied with a mouthy young girl voiced by Sarah Silverman who wants to compete in one of the races. Meanwhile Fix-It Felix also leaves his own game and makes the cross-arcade trek looking for Ralph. Its all mostly predictable stuff -- think Toy Story meets Shrek meets Scott Pilgrim. And the script gets about as mileage as it can out of the notion of a video-game universe where characters have some of the same everyday concerns as your average working stiff; were reminded at one point that a steady villain gig is ""nothing to sneeze at."" But its mostly enjoyable thanks to the likable cast and the visually engaging idea of blending a broad range of video-game imagery into one eye-popping mash-up hyperdetailed CGI warrior chicks living alongside 8-bit simpletons and so on and so forth. Theres some real style here too. Without overstating the case Wreck-It Ralph manages to use the arcade ethos to a somewhat interesting artistic end; director Rich Moore mimics the speed and pace of a video game where tiny gestures can have enormous consequences. Still it does eventually become a bit tedious and for all the breathless kineticism of the films second act you may find yourself twiddling your thumbs. Its a cool game to be sure but watching someone else play it gets old after a while.

Reilly voices the big and clumsy but well-intentioned title character of aWreck-It Ralpha which also features voice work by Sarah Silverman Jane Lynch and others. Unsatisfied with the role he has to play in a video game Ralph makes a daring attempt to create a new life for himself in a different game. There is a certain kind of person who is a dedicated-to-the-end gamer. Who watched avidly as pinball gave way to ""Pong"" as arcade games gave birth to home systems. Who spent years in the company of Mario and Luigi locked in ""Mortal Kombat"" with ""Sonic the Hedgehog."" I am not that person. But I still enjoyed ""Wreck-It Ralph."" And if youre the sort of person who grew calluses from playing ""Space Invaders"" is on a first-name basis with the ""Pac-Man"" characters and thinks Chuck E. Cheese is a fine place for your anniversary dinner you may love it. The picture starts inside a video game where Wreck-It Ralph is sick of being the bad guy in something called ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" He breaks things the uncomplaining Felix puts them back together and on and on it goes until the quarters run out. So Ralph makes a break for it and jumps into another game hoping to hit the reset button and change his life. Of course its not that easy. And before long the characters from several cyber-worlds have gotten mixed up together -- with Ralph stuck in a kiddie game ruled by an evil king and everybody under attack from giant shape-shifting cy-bugs. Its a comical pop-culture casserole. The sticky-sweet kids universe seems to be made up out of parts of the Candyland board game and the old ""Perils of Penelope Pitstop"" cartoon while the alien insects (and the pumped-up soldiers pursuing them) are right out of ""Aliens."" And through it all stumbles big clumsy Ralph. Its fun although the movie doesnt have as much fun as it could. The characters mostly look like CG cartoons instead of video-game denizens. And Ralph comes from an older first-gen world; it would have been terrific if his animation were more crudely retro too. But the terrific John C. Reilly does a fine job with this lovable lugs voice and Jack McBrayer is perfect as the gee-golly-whiz Felix. And while Sarah Silverman is only chirpily annoying as Ralphs little-girl sidekick Alan Tudyk gives the eccentric king the gulping giddiness of Ed Wynn. Best of all is Jane Lynch who plays the soldier in charge of the cy-bug exterminating force -- a tough-as-Kevlar warrior whose drill sergeant obscenities always remain safely and amusingly euphemized into PG-friendly nonsense. And if youre a gamer ... well then another level of humor opens up as a variety of characters make surprise appearances throughout the film. (Not Mario and Luigi alas who wanted too much money. But hey you try getting a plumber on short notice.) True the script is a little slack in parts (and way too reliant on poop jokes) and a little of Silvermans bratty baby voice goes a very long way. But the candy-coated sequences are incredibly inventive and for a Disney-grown product the film takes some risks (even including a sly shot at the companys princess worship). For anyone with a grade-schooler and a free Saturday its a pretty safe and painless bet. And a great excuse to go up to the attic later and see if you can dig out your old Atari 2600. Ratings note The film contains bathroom humor and some scary violence. Wreck-It Ralph (PG) Disney (93 min.) Directed by Rich Moore. With the voices of John C. Reilly Sarah Silverman Jack McBrayer Jane Lynch Alan Tudyk. Now playing in New Jersey.

Disney The most delightful part of Disney Animations latest offering Wreck-It Ralph may be the 10 minutes that take place on screen before the film even begins which feature a la Pixar a touching introductory short entitled ""Paper Man."" When Disney acquired Pixar back in 2006 as part of the Mouses ongoing hegemonic conquest of American childhood John Lasseter became Chief Creative Office not only of Pixar but of Disney Animation as well. And ""Paper Man""--a wordless elegant little romantic fable set in a Mad Men-y Manhattan--may the clearest sign to date that he is intent on remaking the latter in the image of the former. MORE ON FILM Star Wars Will Survive Whatever Horrible Thing Disney Does to It What Reservoir Dogs Got Right 20 Years Ago People The Earthly Disappointments of Cloud Atlas Stanley Kubricks First Film Isnt Nearly as Bad as He Thought It Was Alas the entree does not live up to its appetizer. Its true that Wreck-It Ralph offers about as Pixarishly high-concept a premise as one could ask for. Hulking titular Ralph (John C. Reilly) is the villain of an early-80s arcade game tearing apart a pixelated apartment building while the player joysticks a little repairman Fix-It Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer) back and forth to undo the damage. After three decades of wrecking however Ralph has grown tired of being the bad guy and so begins jumping from video game to video game eager to prove that he too can be a hero. So far so good--but the film never gets much farther. Despite its clever conceit (and promising trailer) Wreck-It Ralph is a substantial disappointment overplotted and underdeveloped cloyingly cute for long stretches and jarringly violent for short ones.Begin with the vocal talent which also includes Jane Lynch as the hard-bitten sergeant of Heros Duty a human-versus-alien-bugs shoot-em-up. Neither she nor Reilly nor McBrayer is bad exactly but all are typecast so meticulously that their performances are largely devoid of inspiration or surprise. (Contrast with for example the wittily counterintuitive casting of Casey Affleck and Christopher Mintz-Plasse in ParaNorman.) Rounding out the primary characters is professional provocatrix Sarah Silverman who voices Vanellope von Schweetz the gung-ho underdog of a candy-colored car-race game called Sugar Rush. The evident gag here--she has preadolescent potty-mouth--quickly grows wearisome. Not as wearisome however as the piling on of video-game nods and references which could astonish even the most jaded specialist in rights acquisitions Space Invaders Centipede Pac-Man Asteroids Qbert Sonic the Hedgehog Street Fighter and many others I no doubt missed. And thats before we even get to the confectionary cameos that blanket the landscape of Sugar Rush Oreos Devil Dogs Mentos Nestle Quik Laffy Taffy... Rather than tap the human core of a story about toys or robots Lasseter delivered a movie with the soul of a video game. The movies principal flaw however is its failure to develop a compelling narrative or genuine emotional connection. Unlike the Pixar films toward which it aspires--which marry sophisticated conceits to straightforward storylines--Wreck-It Ralph consistently gets lost in its own intricate plot mechanics. If a character dies in her own game she can regenerate but if she dies in another she cant; a character whos correctly ""coded"" can jump to other games but a character whos a ""glitch"" cant; the Cybug monstrosities of Heros Duty cant destroy their own game from within but they can destroy others; and who exactly is this mysterious ""Turbo"" to whom everyone keeps referring? Over the course of its 93-minute running time Wreck-It Ralph offers nearly as many twists as a full season of Homeland. The movie is not without its moments of course and kids will enjoy some elements that adults may find off-putting--in particular the alternating saccharine tone and high-fructose velocity of the Sugar Rush portions. But Lasseter who executive produced was clearly aiming for a Pixar-level achievement here. And rather than tap the human core of a story about toys or robots hes delivered a movie with the soul of a video game.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Stephanie Loos/Reuters The Elusive Manipulative Adopted Child Tina Traster Learning how to bond with my daughter who found comfort in the familiarity of being alone has come through understanding reactive attachment disorder. My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight or sleep Last month my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests--the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way.

"Movie review Wreck-It Ralph scores big - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowMovie review Wreck-It Ralph scores bigBeneath the Disney films well-crafted world of video game characters the 3-D animated features major asset is its humanity.November 01 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Its not just the joystick junkie in me that admires ""Wreck-It Ralph"" Disneys wacky new comic adventure with a lovable lug of a video game character at its center. The movies subversive sensibility and old-school/new-school feel are a total kick.Its 3-D animation antics are colored by an 80s-era arcade look that is retro deluxe while its antiheros destructive tendencies have him working a very au courant 12-step program.John C. Reilly Sarah Silverman Jane Lynch and Jack McBrayer voice the anarchy that is about to hit one particular arcade in capital fashion. Though the film is theoretically set in present day everything about it evokes the not-too-distant past when a quarter would buy a kid a lot of time on a computer game and the arcade was still considered a cool hangout by the adolescent set.PHOTOS Familiar Wreck-It Ralph baddiesA bit like ""Tron"" the film exists mostly within the games themselves. The various good guys and bad guys live ordinary lives when the kids arent there making the moves. The film is far more clever in playing off our connection to everything that is wired in this world a a kids crushing disappointment when a game is on the fritz is a classic moment.But ""Wreck-It"" digs deeper without getting too heavy about the ways in which the electronic world has redefined human interaction a the isolation it can breed the inculcation of a winner/loser class divide the very social strata that turn out to be remarkably fragile when someone resists.Consider the games that define ""Wreck-It Ralph."" The action shifts through three each with a distinctive visual style and cultural subtext. It starts with Ralphs (Reilly) home base a simple one called ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" that is built around the big guys demolition skills and Felixs (McBrayer) mess-fixing magic hammer. Even the character design is working-class a Ralph bulked up Felix smaller but equally efficient.MOVIE REVIEWS Whats playing this weekendNot far away is the hyper-violent and hyper-styled war game ""Heros Duty."" Here all the bodies are hard especially Sgt. Calhouns (Lynch) a svelte soldier in skin-tight fatigues who has never met a man she didnt want to order around.And then theres the movies sweet spot a the anime-influenced ""Sugar Rush"" a a go-cart extravaganza built out of mouth-watering confections so enticing it will make your teeth hurt. There lives a spunky little glitch (think of it as a computer version of a character flaw) named Vanellope von Schweetz that Silverman milks for all its worth. She wants her shot at winning a race but the game wont allow ""glitches"" to compete and theres a mean-girl group around to make her life miserable. Vanellope keeps pixelating at the most inopportune times a maddening when its happening on your laptop genius in the way it keeps the story rocking. Shes about to enlist Ralph in her game-changing efforts and a fragile friendship will be born. The testing of their bond does much to shape events in the film but it will take Ralph a little time to get there.Ralphs journey begins as so many do these days with a little soul-searching during a support group session with other arcade villains. After 30 years in the demo game hes having second thoughts. Destruction is only his day job but at night Ralph is still on the outside looking in. He feels miscast and misunderstood.So he sets out for a game that he can win and a gold medal that he can claim a certain thats the key to acceptance back home. His going rogue sets in motion all sorts of problems with Felix and Sgt. Calhoun in hot pursuit a ""hot"" being the operative word for their surprisingly sizzling connection.There is great attention to detail in the creation of Ralphs universe a both in design and in intent. Take the transit system that runs through the electric cords a not only does it look cool it allows the characters to break out of their own boxes. And who doesnt need that on occasion? Game Central Station a grand and meticulously conceived a is the gateway to the inner-arcade world. Echoes of a certain New York City Beaux-Arts terminal are surely intended and is but one of many delicious visual allusions.The ever-present fear for the game pieces is that a bug will corrupt their system a fear that soon threatens to become reality. From the invading bug and the way it spreads to the computerized innards of the games the animators have had a field day.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWreck-It Ralph Flight open strong despite stormNovember 4 2012Wreck-it Ralph cheat code Which video games get...November 3 2012Henry Jackmans 8-bit trek from the Commodore to Wreck-It...November 2 2012Wreck-it Ralph to crush competition; Hurricane Sandy is...November 1 2012Schwarzeneggers Behavior on Film SetsOctober 5 2003MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainmentVideo GameCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-wreck-it-ralph-review-20121102,0,7169592.story",200,wreck-itralph6,wreck-itralph,latimes

Dave McGinn The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 02 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Nov. 02 2012 1108AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Rich Moore Written by Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston Starring John C. Reilly Sarah Silverman Jack McBrayer Jane Lynch Classification PG Genre animation How much you will like Wreck-It Ralph may depend on a fundamentally important generational question Do you know who Qbert is?If the answer is yes then youre the right age to remember feeding quarters in to video games at arcades and you will love every sight gag and in-joke from the 8-bit era.If the answer is no then youre either too young or too old. But the good news is even though you wont get every joke its so well constructed in its plot and imagery that it moves brilliantly along leaping from one perfectly rendered world to the next like Frogger in Frogger - who yes is one of many characters to make a cameo. (Ask your dad.) Screen grab from the online trailer for ""Wreck It Ralph"" Movies Wreck It Ralph The official trailer Jack McBrayer plays Fix It Felix Jr. in Wreck-It-Ralph. For The Globe and Mail news With Jack McBrayer Mr. Nice Guy isnt just a character John C. Reilly plays Wreck-It Ralph the building-smashing bad guy in a game called Fix It Felix Jr. As the game is about to celebrate its 30th anniversary Ralph is tired of being the bad guy. Every day its the same smash a building and then watch as Fix-It Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer) with his magic hammer repairs the damage and picks up a gold medal while Ralph is tossed off the roof left to go sleep on a big pile of bricks. To prove hes not a bad guy he ""game jumps"" travelling through the wires that connect every machine in the arcade to win a gold medal of his own. What he doesnt know is that he might destroy every game by doing so.Sound like its got a Toy Story vibe? Its no coincidence. Executive producer John Lasseter directed both Toy Story in which beloved childhood entities have a secret life of their own and its sequel. But the movie never feels like a second-rate rip-off. And even though it doesnt have the same emotional pull and its storytelling drifts much more toward the conventional it stands alone on its own merits.Chief among them is how it completely nails video-game imagery from the 1980s on through to the first-person shooter games of the modern era. When Ken and Ryu knock off after a long day of Street Fighter to share a cold one at Tapper both games are perfectly rendered. And Heros Duty the game where Ralph meets Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) battling ""Cy-Bugs"" looks and feels indistinguishable from Halo and its ilk.Its impossible not to feel a strong sense of nostalgic amusement if not sheer delight at the comings and goings of all these characters. I dont own an MRI machine but I guarantee that just seeing Sonic the Hedgehog lights up the Gen X amygdala like a house on fire.Even though kids might not catch Paperboy references the movie always manages to play to the younger sets sensibilities whether its the humour of a bad guys anonymous meeting or the flat-out genius of Lynchs characters ""most tragic backstory of all.""Its when Ralph lands in a racing game called Sugar Rush - designed with all the trippy psychedelics of Mario Kart - that the movie finds its emotional core. Forced to partner with a young would-be racer named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) Ralph will have to put aside his own quest and learn what it really means to be the good guy.If that strikes you as too saccharine or cheesy then I suggest you take that locked-up heart of yours and press up up down down left right left right B A.

Reilly is quite fruitful as the voice of the title character (left) in the Disney 3-D animated feature ""Wreck-It Ralph.""       Photo Photo courtesy of Magnolia Pictures When the hero says ""I wreck things. Professionally"" I thought I had wandered into ""The Barack Obama Story"" but the speaker in Disneys visually dazzling intermittently funny ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a depressed video-game villain who yearns to be the good guy. As in good enough to make this movie an arcade version of ""Toy Story."" Despite a promising start the movie doesnt rise that high. After work when the kids have gone home Ralph (voiced by the brilliant John C. Reilly) the designated destroyer in a retro 80s-style video game similar to Donkey Kong sleeps in a dump -- literally -- and resents the penthouse partiers led by the games hero Felix (Jack McBrayer) who wont even invite him to a 30th- anniversary celebration of their electronic universe. Ralph resorts to hanging out in glum support groups with other villains such as the ghost from Pac-Man (possibly in the same therapists office frequented by the Incredibles). Ralph is funny and endearing and the films 3-D animation is spectacular but the movie goes wrong when Ralph jumps into another game Sugar Rush a Willy Wonka-fied Oz that gives us a lot of candy puns -- and a saccharine heroine Vanellope von Schweetz. Shes voiced in a gratingly cutesy style by Sarah Silverman who never notices that Reilly does far better by giving a grown-up comedy reading to his lines. Vanellope is a fellow outcast handicapped by an e-birth defect Shes a ""glitch"" meaning her avatar fades in and out and from here on in the script flickers too. The story line initially about Ralphs quest for a medal (which wouldnt seem to reverse his pariah status anyway) gets clouded as Vanellope prepares for a race in a homemade car fashioned out of candy. Moreover her character is irritating -- an unattractive combo of pandering and political correctness. In other words she has to be ""empowering to little girls"" to maximize toy sales but the four screenwriters become prisoners of feminism. Buzz Lightyear didnt need to carry a message. He was just funny. Vanellopes condition reminds us that were all special and nothing can ever stand in our way Candyland meets Clicheville. Lots of other stale treats are on offer too Jane Lynch does her standard tough-talk shtick as a character from a military shoot-em-up game the big race looks like a girlied-up ""Cars"" and McBrayers lines sound like theyre straight out of ""30 Rock"" ""I dont have to do boo for you forgive my potty mouth."" Jane Jack Time to freshen up the act a little. Still If youre 6 or under I suppose this will all seem new. And amid all the boring crashing and chasing and slapstick there are some brilliant flashes of wit (particularly a reference to the guards in the Wizard of Oz). Vanellope -- with her feisty one-liners (""stinkbrain"" she calls Ralph which doesnt even make sense) her hoodie miniskirt and striped tights -- reminds me of Poochie the surfing dog ""with attitude"" on ""The Simpsons"" who wickedly illustrated corporate pandering to kids. Ralph has a line whose self-evident lameness would have been mocked on ""The Simpsons"" but here its actually delivered in earnest to cheer up Vanellope ""Youre a winner And youre adorable And everybody loves an adorable winner"" Yes and lets not keep score and give everyone who plays the game the same prize afterward. Starting with this movie which gets a big blue ribbon labeled ""Enthusiastic participant.""

Starring John C. Reilly Jack McBrayer Sarah Silverman Jane Lynch Adam Carolla Jamie Elman Rachael Harris Dennis Haysbert Mindy Kaling Edie McClurg Director Rich Moore Running time 148 Release Opened Nov 2 2012  Editorial Review Clever idea but too much sugarBy Michael OSullivanFriday November 2 2012Heres what the reviews would say if ""Wreck-It Ralph"" were an actual video game and not a video-game-themed movie Great concept and graphics weak story mode. The 3-D animated comedy is the story of a goofy bad guy out of a retro arcade game who ""game jumps"" leaving his cloistered universe -- and prescribed role as the heavy -- in search of fulfillment in other games. Its a clever and original idea with lots of cute sight gags. (One of the ghosts from ""Pac-Man"" is the leader of a support group for misunderstood villains.) But the narrative itself is overly busy noisy and unengaging with little of the charm and heart that won viewers over in the ""Toy Story"" franchise allowing that film to transcend its roots in the world of inanimate playthings. The voice casting here works well. In the title role of a hulking destroyer whos only good at smashing things but who dreams of becoming a hero John C. Reilly manages to evoke the pathos of the outsider. And Sarah Silverman is pretty perfect as Vanellope von Schweetz a tomboyish pre-adolescent driver in a kiddie drag-racing game called ""Sugar Rush"" that Ralph serendipitously finds himself in. Like Ralph Vanellope aspires to video-game greatness. Vanellopes world may be almost nauseatingly pink and sugary -- its overstuffed with product placements for such junk food as Devil Dogs and Nesquik -- but the actress brings an acerbic tartness to the role. That and the characters salty if juvenile tongue helps cut some of the sweetness out of the setting. Vanellope makes much of the fact that Ralph visited a sci-fi war game called ""Heros Duty"" before arriving in ""Sugar Rush."" (She of course pronounces it ""doody."") The unexpected friendship between Ralph and Vanellope is one of the nicest things about the movie. Hes a misfit runaway and shes a ""glitch"" a character whose digital computer code has begun to malfunction threatening not just her livelihood as a driver but also her life. Together they try to realize their own -- and each others -- dreams. That unsurprisingly involves a lot of frenzied racing and other miscellaneous action. Following Ralph into ""Sugar Rush"" is his old nemesis Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) a goody-two-shoes with a magic golden hammer and his own discontents. ""Why do I fix everything I touch?"" he laments after trying -- and failing -- to break something. Then theres Calhoun (Jane Lynch) a pneumatic-bosomed warrior whos trying to exterminate the alien ""cybugs"" that Ralph has inadvertently introduced into Vanellopes world of gum drops and lollipops. (Dont buy Milk Duds at the concession stand or youll have a sugar crash.) Thats a lot of plot and thats not even the half of it. That may please hardcore gamers who are used to processing complex seemingly never-ending story lines but its needless clutter in a movie geared toward a young audience. Plus it distracts from the ""human"" element of the tale if thats not a contradiction in terms. Its actually not. Theres a kernel of genuine feeling in the relationship between Ralph and Vanellope. Themes of self-sacrifice and being true to oneself also are there if subtly. But those themes are largely lost under the films candy coating which emphasizes action and eye-popping visuals over emotion. Contains mild video-game violence and bathroom humor.

Reilly provides the voice of Wreck-It Ralph (left) a character in a 1980s ""Donkey Kong"" clone. Photo Disney Associated Press Wreck-It Ralph review A winner 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Wreck-It Ralph Animated comedy. Starring the voices of John C. Reilly Sarah Silverman and Jack McBrayer. Directed by Rich Moore. (PG. 93 minutes.) The best eras of animation occur when filmmakers are encouraged to follow their muse. Think of how many different ways a shortsighted modern studio head might shoot down ""Fantasia"" or ""Wall-E"" if given the chance. If there were focus groups involved with ""Wreck-It Ralph"" it doesnt show in the finished product. The Disney tribute to arcade gaming is delightfully off the rails offering a grown-up-friendly tone and merging of visual styles that are reminiscent of the studios 1988 animated homage to film noir ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" This film lacks the expert pacing of ""Roger Rabbit"" but it gets the details right. Powered by nostalgia while throwing out most of the rules its rare that a minute goes by without at least one inspired moment. Wreck-It Ralph is a character in an early 1980s ""Donkey Kong"" clone called ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" After being thrown off his blocky retro animated building and into the mud one too many times he tells a support group of video game villains that he doesnt want to be a bad guy anymore. The resulting heros journey takes Ralph through the arcade settling in a modern racing game called ""Sugar Rush"" - where he mentors Vanellope von Schweetz a character whose ""glitch"" properties have made her an outcast. The similarities to ""Monsters Inc."" and the ""Toy Story"" franchise - particularly the recent animated short ""Small Fry"" - are obvious on the surface. (Pixars John Lasseter executive-produced ""Wreck-It Ralph."") But the style and tone are unique with a frenetic pace and a lowbrow humor that separate it from its Pixar cousins. The comedy is often slapstick and occasionally base but its not cheap. John C. Reilly and Sarah Silverman (as Ralph and Vanellope) are allowed to bring enough of themselves to the roles that their potty-humor banter never seems forced or gratuitous. Screenwriters Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston keep an edge on the comedy throughout. Qbert is homeless in ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and the send-up of the shapely female space marine leader from the fictitious ""Heros Duty"" game is vicious in its hilarity. As much as the dialogue the visuals offer enjoyment especially for geeky older viewers who once made an arcade their second home. Residents of the retro ""Niceland"" all move in simple almost teleported jumps. (An exploding cake creates a blocky 8-bit mess.) Characters from the newer games have their own modern neuroses victims of too much adrenaline and an almost gross sexuality. Someone at Wellesley College is going to write a really great term paper about the deeper meaning of this film. Action nostalgia and humor power the movie until the final act when the filmmakers penchant for rewriting the rules as they go becomes a liability. The story twists may be too convoluted for even the adults in the audience. Given the excellent opening - maybe the best first 20 minutes for an animated film since ""Up"" - the big finish feels underwhelming. But like a good arcade classic from the 1980s much of the enjoyment is in the experience not the critical analysis of the plot. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a rush. If its not the ""Pac-Man"" of animated movies its definitely in ""Dig Dug"" territory. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is the bad guy in the popular video game Fix-It Felix Jr. For 30 years the muscleman has punched the same building only to be defeated time after time by hero Felix (Jack McBrayer) who repairs the damage with his magic hammer.The repetition and isolation of the game is getting to him.Directed by Rich Moore the Disney film ""Wreck-It Ralph"" has two target audiences kids who love animated movies and adults who grew up at the arcade. It doesnt always hit the bulls-eye for either group but it comes close. At his support group Bad-Anon Ralph confides to Clyde the Ghost (from Pac Man) Bowser (from Super Mario Bros.) and other fellow baddies that hes tired of being a villain. More iconic creatures (pity poor Qbert) roam around Game Central Station where characters converge when their work is done for the night.Ralph searches for a place where he can be the hero and finds himself battling alongside the commanding Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) in the first-person shooter Heros Duty. In his continuing quest he ends up in another game Sugar Rush.In this pastel land a world of sweets ruled by King Candy (Alan Tudyk) he meets spunky Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Sliverman) a determined girl who has one big problem Shes a glitch who cant win in her own game. The fun of ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is discovering the worlds of these characters and the clever 3-D graphics of each game. Fix -It Felix pays tribute to 80s classic Donkey Kong Heros Duty takes on the military aggression of Call of Duty and Sugar Rush is like an animated Candy Land.But while its sweet to see Vanellope and Ralph bond as outcasts fighting for acceptance and the voice cast is spot-on the storyline grows convoluted in the second half. And with all the potential game tie-ins and candy brand mentions the movie at times feels more like a marketers dream than a story for kids. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a lot like video games and candy light entertainment but fun while it lasts.What ""Wreck-It Ralph""  Three stars out four  Rating PG  Run time 141  Content Some rude humor and mild action and violence Jody Mitori is the Post-Dispatchs assistant managing editor for features.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Nov. 1 2012 758 p.m. ET Four years after Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic and became a global hero the humorist James Thurber published a New Yorker magazine piece ""The Greatest Man in the World"" about a fictional pilot named Jack ""Pal"" Smurch. Mr. Thurbers aviator flew around the world nonstop in a rickety airplane he had built then revealed himself to be a braggart a fool and a generally despicable human being. The airline pilot played by Denzel Washington Whip Whitaker is far from despicable--he is after all played by Denzel Washington--but hes no Chesley Sullenberger either. ""Flight"" which was directed by Robert Zemeckis soars when Whip is at the controls struggling to save a seemingly doomed airplane. When hes back on the ground and struggling with himself the film takes a surprising turn into a drama of addiction and moral exploration. One unwelcome surprise is how shopworn the storys components prove to be. Still theyre enhanced if not redeemed by Mr. Washingtons stirring portrait of a skillful prideful pilot hitting bottom. White-knuckle fliers may want to pass on ""Flight"" altogether though theyll be missing an early sequence thats right up there with the best of the incipient-disaster genre Think ""Airplane"" without the laughs. Whats unclear is whether Whip who shouldnt even be sitting in the cockpit will be up to the challenge. Whats abundantly clear from the outset of the midair crisis is that a cascade of malfunctions will make his airplane uncontrollable. (However wildly over the top the sequence may seem to be its only a heightening of what actually happened off the California coast in 2000 when a loose jackscrew jammed the horizontal stabilizer of an Alaska Airlines MD-83 sending the airplane into a dive from which the pilots tried unsuccessfully to recover by flying upside down.) Crisis has been a major food group for many of the characters Mr. Washington has played; hes such a quick-witted star with his flashing smile and mercurial spirit that he ingests danger gleefully and thrives on it. Not this time though. Its a shock to see the shape hes in--overweight unkempt a star stripped of his charisma for a role that keeps him in a garishly unflattering light. And Whips experience and demonstrable skill may not be enough to save him even though hes first hailed as a hero. Too many secrets threaten to bring him down in the investigation that follows his fateful flight. Watch a clip from the Robert Zemeckis film ""Flight."" An airline pilot (Denzel Washington) saves a flight from crashing but an investigation into the malfunctions reveals something troubling. Also starring Nadine Velazquez. (Photo amp; Video Paramount) When movie stars choose roles that make them unattractive theyre often praised for their courage even though doing so can amount to adventurous career management. Id rather praise Mr. Washington for the eloquence solemnity and disarming humor of his performance as a man whose body and soul are beset by the contending forces of probity and deceit a good man whose addictions to drugs and booze have turned him into a shameless liar. That said the script by John Gatins brings mixed blessings at best. Instead of hurtling to a climax the story moves in fits and starts loses momentum injects itself with cockeyed comedy-- John Goodmans Falstaffian drugmeister is the damnedest deus ex machina youve ever seen--lumbers through 12-step thickets and finally resolves into an old-fashioned morality play. Mr. Zemeckiss direction is similarly a mixture of thrilling action incisive characterization overblown set pieces--the federal crash investigation is staged like a full-scale congressional hearing--and shameless though effective melodrama. The cast includes Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood both of whom give the movies star valuable support and Kelly Reilly who as another addict in Whips life turns tepid writing into passionate humanity. Watch a clip from the Disney animated film ""Wreck-It Ralph."" A video game villain (John C. Reilly) wants to be a hero but his quest brings havoc to the whole arcade where he lives. Also with Jane Lynch amp; Sarah Silverman. (Photo amp; Video Disney) Wreck-It Ralph Can it be that three decades have passed since video arcade games such as Pac-Man and Donkey Kong first unleashed their jumpy choppy charmingly blocky characters on a pop-eyed public? Disneys DIS 0.04 % latest animated feature evokes nostalgia for that bygone era of barebones 8-bit technology and simple gameplay rules with a genially simple scheme. Just as Pixars ""Toy Story"" trilogy revealed the secret life of toys ""Wreck-It Ralph"" follows characters from a game called ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" a takeoff on Donkey Kong. On duty theyre exuberant primitives. Off duty theyre fully drawn creatures in a 3-D world. Ralph voiced by John C. Reilly is the games bad guy a sensitive hulk who wants desperately to win a medal as a good guy. To that end he flees his consoles confines travels around the arcade electronically and patches himself with chaotic consequences into a succession of modern high-definition games. Its a lovely pretext for dazzling visuals yet the production is diminished by the clumsiness of an 8-bit script. Thats a major or a minor matter depending on how addicted you may have been to those early games many of whose characters make cameo appearances; whether the film will connect with todays young kids is a major matter soon to be resolved. The story begins promisingly with Ralph in an envious funk. He has always been compelled to wreck things--the rules of his game are inviolable--while Felix ( Jack McBrayer) has always gotten praise for fixing things with his magic hammer. A 12-step group for bad guys doesnt do much for Ralphs bruised psyche so the first stop on his pilgrimage is logically enough a game called ""Heros Duty."" There he impersonates a robot and meets Vanellope von Schweetz ( Sarah Silverman) a shrill and glitchy character--she suffers from visual static--who has been evicted from her own game of ""Sugar Rush."" ENLARGE Wreck-It Ralph and Vanellope von Schweetz Disney The film was directed by Rich Moore in his feature debut and written by Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnston. Its narrative core concerns the fraught friendship of Ralph and Vanellope which in turn poses the question of whether a bad guy can really transform himself into a good guy. (Spoiler alert Yes he can.) But character gets trampled as the action goes turbo Vanellopes voice grows ever more shrill and we find ourselves trapped along with Ralph in a Sugar Rush surround of oppressively pretty colors and numbingly repetitive races and chases. A further question posed by ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is whether brilliant animation alone can sustain a film that comes up short in dramatic development. (Spoiler alert No it cant.) Watch a clip from the film ""This Must Be the Place."" Cheyenne (Sean Penn) a retired rock star returns to New York to find the man responsible for a humiliation suffered by his recently deceased father during WWII. (Photo amp; Video Weinstein Co.) This Must Be the Place Sean Penn stars as Cheyenne a burned-out American rock star living in Dublin and trapped in a second passive childhood plus full Goth regalia. At several points Cheyenne says ""Somethings not quite right here I dont know exactly what it is but something...."" Before I get to what that something might be let me touch on several relatively right things about this remarkably lifeless film which Paolo Sorrentino directed from a script he wrote with Umberto Contarello. Mr. Penns performance depressed by the nature of his sad-clown character is self-regarding in ways that are simultaneously dismaying and fascinating. The music by David Byrne and Will Oldham is exceptionally varied and characteristically rich. The cinematographer Luca Bigazzi finds one striking vista after another when Cheyenne leaves Dublin and criss-crosses the U.S. ENLARGE Sean Penn and Frances McDormand The Weinstein Company Whats wrong here ludicrously and groanworthily wrong is the reason for Cheyennes criss-crossings. He is it develops on a hunt for the Nazi war criminal who did some unspecified something to his late father during the Holocaust. As juxtapositions go regressed Goth rock star and Holocaust could hardly be more bizarre and bizarre can be good when its done deftly. In this case however its done ponderously and sententiously. The movies title is taken from the classic Talking Heads song which is subtitled ""Naive Melody."" Cheyenne is a faux naif in a faux tone poem. DVD Focus ENLARGE Unstoppable Unstoppable (2010) Denzel Washington at his most irresistible in an action thriller by the late Tony Scott that gives new meaning to the notion of a one-track mind. The premise is simple to the point of primal--a runaway freight train hurtling through Pennsylvania with a load of lethal chemicals and no one in the locomotive. On the same track heading toward it is another freight train pulled by a locomotive with the movies co-stars at the controls Mr. Washington is the veteran engineer and Chris Pine is the rookie conductor. Rosario Dawson is Connie a yardmaster who knows her stuff. ENLARGE Seth Gordons documentary The King of Kong A Fistful of Quarters is about the quest for the worlds highest score in Donkey Kong. Picturehouse/Everett Collection The King of Kong A Fistful of Quarters (2007) Seth Gordons documentary sees the craziness of it all--the quest for the worlds highest Donkey Kong score; the beeps and boops emanating from the big retro boxes; the pervasiveness of pinnacle-and-fame disease that prompts outwardly sane people to seek enshrinement in the Guinness Book of World Records. Yet Mr. Gordon also understands the roiling passions that underlie the virtuosity and hes got a great eye for spotting real-life heroes--or antiheroes as the case may be. ""The King of Kong"" is blessed with one of each so feed this DVD to your player and press Play. ENLARGE Sweet and Lowdown Sweet and Lowdown (1999) Sean Penn is Emmet Ray a fictional 1930s jazz musician in Woody Allens mock documentary which uses real jazz critics as earnest commentators. Emmet is as lowdown as a man can get. Vain selfish fatuous and casually cruel he is the personification of insensitivity; his idea of good clean fun is shooting rats in garbage dumps. Give him a guitar though and hes an angel channeling the music of the spheres. The movie represents Woody in a minor mode but its marvelous all the same. Samantha Morton is the childlike Hattie a mute waif with a clouded mind. -- Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com and follow him on Twitter JoeMorgenstern.

Its called Fix-It Felix Jr. Note who gets the games star billing. More about Wreck-It Ralph >> When a player puts her quarters in Fix-It Felix Ralph a wrecking ball disguised as a muscleman decimates a city block. Quicker than Ralph can shatter windows and masonry  Fix-It Felix  (think Bob the Builder) repairs them with his neon hammer. For this he wins medals and the love of the citizens of Niceland who shun Ralph as a bully. But Ralph is determined to change his reputation in the diverting Disney animation Wreck-It Ralph. Though Ralph imagines video-game characters in identity crisis the movie fails to communicate their inner lives. In other words this pleasant diversion lacks the emotional pull of Toy Story. After 30 years of being jeered as demolition man while Felix gets cheered as rebuilder Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) joins a support group that includes other vid-game villains looking for a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t. The group includes Pac-Man and Bowser from Super Mario. To paraphrase classic toon vixen Jessica Rabbit theyre not bad - theyre just drawn that way. Ralph is emboldened to seek his destiny outside the fixed rules of Fix-It Felix escaping through a charger cable to see if he might be a hero in another arcade game. He commences his search for validation in the movie which fuses the narratives and visuals of Tron and The Wizard of Oz before it exiles Ralph to a retro video game called Sugar Rush which resembles an arcade Candy Land. For the adult viewer who picks up the references the effect is mind-bending. The 8-year-old for whom the movie is intended will be too enthralled with the electric-Kool-Aid color and with Ralph breaking the rules of the game to notice. Like the cowardly Lion from Oz who wants a medal for bravery Ralph wants a prize of his own. Venturing to a video game called Heros Duty he aids Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch armed with wisecracks and something semiautomatic) and gets his gold. Then the villain who would be hero surfaces in the video game Sugar Rush. There he befriends Vannelope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman chirpily funny) an outcast believed to be an electronic ""glitch"" a programming error. Naturally the villain rehabilitating himself comes to the aid of the girl trying to redeem herself. Like a video game Rich Moores 3-D film is colorful noisy and pixel-deep.

Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Walt Disney Pictures Wreck-It Ralph Director Rich Moore Genre Animation Running Time 93 minutes Rated PG for some rude humor and mild action/violence With John C. Reilly Jack McBrayer Sarah Silverman (Recommended) Watch Clips Not Going Turbo Not Going Turbo Credit Walt Disney Pictures Not From Here Not From Here Credit Walt Disney Pictures After a very long engagement that began with the original Toy Story Disney finally made an honest woman out of Pixar in 2006 when it paid the requisite billions to move the computer animation giant into the Magic Kingdom. But Disneys spirited 2010 hit Tangled made it abundantly clear that Pixar had a say in the creative marriage The story of Rapunzel may be standard Disney princess fare but the whip-crack pacing and fractured-fairy tale wit felt unmistakably Pixar. From now on it would seem Mickey Mouse and Luxo Jr. might remain separate icons but theyre marching under the same banner. With that in mind see if the premise of Wreck-It Ralph sounds familiar A collection of synthetic characters -- some new some recognizable and beloved by people of all ages -- are playthings for children but they come to life and interact when nobody else is around. Replace the toy box with the arcade machine and Wreck-It Ralph is basically a repurposed Toy Story movie suffused with the same mix of adventure and nostalgia and themes of friendship and the existential crises that come with age. A cynic might dismiss the film as reheated leftovers. But that cynic would be wrong because those leftovers are delicious. Directed by Rich Moore who had a hand in several all-time great Simpsons episodes (""Marge vs. The Monorail"" and ""Cape Feare"" among them) Wreck-It Ralph is pop nirvana a headlong rush through classic arcade games and Nintendo standards thats not too busy playing spot-the-reference to keep from paying off in laughs and heart. It may deploy the Pixar formula shamelessly but the world of video games -- particularly for those who feel affection for them -- is uniquely immersive and Moore and his team of animators have evoked it with equal parts sweetness and wit. Adding another character to his gallery of ingratiating lugs John C. Reilly voices Wreck-It Ralph the 8-bit villain of Fix-It Felix Jr. a 30-year-old arcade favorite that bears a striking resemblance to Donkey Kong. He doesnt mind hurling debris at Fix-It Felix (30 Rocks Jack McBrayer) the chipper young go-getter with the magic hammer but the ""bad guy"" label stays with him after hours when the kids have gone home and the characters inside the game are still shutting him out. After commiserating with various other video game villains -- including one of the ghosts from Pac-Man who hosts ""Bad-Anon"" meetings -- Ralph vows to shed the label by infiltrating another video game and winning one of those ""Hero"" medals that so frequently adorn his rival. Wreck-It Ralph succeeds in part by building carefully conceived elaborately detailed video game worlds. Disney hide caption toggle caption Disney To that end Ralph ventures into Heros Duty a modern first-person shooter game that couldnt be further removed from the quaint mechanics of his 8-bit home. (The differences in the way characters from separate gaming eras move are one of the films most subtle distinct pleasures.) But his adventures eventually land him in Sugar Rush a Candyland cart-racing game where he teams up with Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) a fluttering ""glitch"" who dreams of glory but lives in exile from the tyrannical Willy Wonka-type who lords over the circuitry. Wreck-It Ralph is overstuffed with narrative business -- a major subplot sends Felix in pursuit of Ralph with the Lara Croft-like heroine of Heros Duty voiced by Jane Lynch -- and the borders and safeguards that rule its world-within-a-world are similarly dense. But none of it gums up the films relentless momentum A lot of thought has been put into how Ralph might interact with the gibberish-spouting Qbert or the beer-slinging bartender from Tapper and the story moves fluidly between several richly imagined gaming environments all connected by a power strip that serves as Grand Central Station. Though its full of touches certain to tickle stand-up arcade game fanatics -- the Pac-Man Fever team of Buckner amp; Garcia contribute the closing-credit song and the many bleeps and music cues on the soundtrack have been ported over from decades-old classics -- Wreck-It Ralph makes good on the core relationship between Ralph and Vanellope a villain and a glitch who come together as outsiders in their own homes exiled by their peers. Gaming nerds can certainly relate.

He goes hopping from game to game in the arcade and inadvertently unleashes a powerful new enemy. Claudia Puig USA TODAY 510 p.m. EDT November 1 2012The universe of arcade games is a vast one and Wreck-It Ralph sets out on a trek to transcend his programmed limitations and go from bad guy to hero.Video game characters Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) and Felix (Jack McBrayer) come to life in Wreck-It-Ralph the latest animated film from Disney.(Photo Disney)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourStars John C. Reilly Jack McBrayer Jane Lynch Sarah Silverman Mindy KalingRated PG; runtime 1 hour 48 minutes; opens Friday nationwideWith Halloween bags still brimming its an ideal time for the inventive candy-colored fun and wicked humor that is Wreck-It Ralph.The dazzling 3-D animated tale is set in the world of video arcades and a large portion of it takes place in Sugar Rush a cart-racing game that resembles a more elaborate and vibrantly hued Candyland.With Wreck-It Ralph (1/2 stars out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) Disney is clearly trying to do for the video arcade world what Toy Story did for tangible playthings which is to humanize them into fully realized engaging characters.Though the story is not groundbreaking and none of the characters are quite as lovable or potentially iconic as Woody Buzz and their Toy Story brigade the farcical story is cute the dialogue witty and the players charming.WLOSZCZYNA Wreck-It Ralph is a Disney animation game-changerPHOTOS Wreck-It Ralph video characters get their game onJohn C. Reilly is spot-on as the titular brawny character with a voice that captures the characters good heart and rough exterior. The 9-foot-tall 643-pound bad guy from the 80s arcade game Fix-It Felix Jr. is tired of being ostracized for his destructive tendencies. He cant help it if he was programmed that way. After 30 years hes tired of his demolition job. Ralph just wants to be loved.The big guy decides the only way to win his cohorts affection is to earn a medal. To prove his mettle he goes to the most likely place -- the Heros Duty game via Game Central Station vividly modeled after New Yorks Grand Central Terminal.In Heros Duty he crosses paths with tough Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) and ends up in the land of Sugar Rush -- which incorporates elements of Japanese anime. In this vibrantly hued land of cupcakes cookies and candy he meets the sharp-tongued and scrappy little misfit Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman). Initially Ralph sees her as a pest but as the story plunges deeper into her back story he feels the stirrings of compassion. A glitch in her character -- a pixelating programming error -- has caused the other residents of Sugar Rush to marginalize and mock her. Even the ruling King Candy (a very funny vaudeville-style Alan Tudyk) has a part in the cruelty. Both outsiders Ralph and Vanellope ultimately connect in an endearing father/daughter-type friendship.When Ralph leaves his game in search of a medal his actions have serious consequences. The game cant function without someone around to wreck things for Fix-It Felix Jr. (30 Rocks Jack McBrayer) to repair. The arcade owners are about to pull the plug. Felix rushes off to find Ralph and set things right to keep the game alive.Actors were well-cast for their vocal talents and their one-liners are some of the funniest in any Disney animated film.The game worlds depicted just scratch the surface of arcade possibilities so sequels are a no-brainer. But unlike so many franchise films that are just attempts at squeezing more money out of moviegoers additional movies set in this universe make sense and would be a welcome addition to family films provided that the overall quality stays as high as this one.Wreck-It Ralph is a bouncy hilarious and heart-warming game-trotting trip. Unlike a sugar rush it provides lasting enjoyment.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare John C.

Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Zany rambunctious and visually stunning ""Wreck-It Ralph"" plunders the world of arcade video games to create a fantasy/comedy where onscreen avatars party like merry hell after the playland closes. Think ""Tron"" with belly laughs. Or ""Night at the Museum"" with any laughs. John C. Reilly delivers an inspired vocal turn as the title character a Popeye-armed lummox whose role is to damage a building that players repair with the help of Fix-It Felix Jr. Its a repetitive unappreciated gig (can you feel it dads in the audience?) and Felix gets all the adulation from the games other characters. Ralph yearns for his own taste of heroism. He gets little help from the members of his Bad Guys Support Group (attendees include ""Street Fighters"" burly Zangief a ""House of the Dead"" zombie and Inky the Ghost from ""Pac-Man""). So moving through the arcades circuitry he infiltrates a futuristic war game and makes off with a heros medal. Disrupting that games reality sets off a domino chain of collateral disorder. The only way to set things right is to enter a racing game a few cabinets over and join forces with a spunky underdog girl driver (Sarah Silverman in delectably bratty form) who glitches out in moments of high stress. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a visual tour de force juggling the look of flat herky-jerky old-school games and the slick high-def sheen of the current generation. The film cleverly hedges its bets with jokes and references for young and older audiences alike. Theres a quick cameo by the new electronica star Skrillex (who contributed a song to the soundtrack) and jokes for duffers who memorized the up-down left-right secret codes for Nintendo game pads. Though young moviegoers probably play their games on iPhones rather than quarter-gobbling standup consoles the films impish energy will surely carry them along. Older gamers should feel sweet pangs of nostalgia when Q-bert that tube-nosed jumping eggplant of yore drops in to goose the plot along. The Disney Animation project was overseen by John Lasseter chief of the Pixar brain trust and its a relief to see him back in his element after the live-action fiasco ""John Carter."" Alongside Emmy-winning director Rich Moore (""The Simpsons"") Lasseter makes ""Wreck-It Ralph"" a colorful rebuke to the established Disney formula of recent years. Theres less reliance on movie-star vocal turns musical numbers and goofball sidekicks but more whitewater pacing character development and wit alongside the standard Mouse House sentiment. Disney Associated Press Ralph voiced by John C. Reilly left and Vanellope Von Schweetz voiced by Sarah Silverman in ""Wreck-It Ralph."" Beneath the whirligig fun theres a message or two to chew on with bad guys who are really good and good guys who are truly villains. Jane Lynch is a hoot as Sgt. Calhoun a two-fisted military heroine whose macho mannerisms guard a heart as soft as sweet creamery butter. And Alan Tudyk delightfully mimics Ed Wynns giggly quavering voice as King Candy the Oz-meets-Mayor-McCheese sovereign of gameland. Tudyk knows how to say funny things and how to say things funny. The film is all about being ones best self under pressure reaching out to outcasts and trying to understand the rules that other folks operate by. But theres not a preachy or heavy-handed moment in it.

BOTTOM LINE Witty adventure and a heartfelt homage to arcade games past. CAST Voices of John C. Reilly Sarah Silverman Jack McBrayer Jane Lynch Alan Tudyk. LENGTH 133 Has Qbert a soul? Does Pac-Man dream? What lies beyond the land of ""Mario Go Kart""? And in the human comedy of free will versus not can we change what we are or are we simply the result of our programming? Such questions resonate throughout the animated Disney feature ""Wreck-It Ralph"" in which the titular video-game bad guy tired of being ostracized and looked down upon by the fellow denizens of the arcade game ""Fix-It Felix"" runs away from home basically -- a brilliantly minimalistic take on the root of the classic heroic journey. From there the simple striving Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) finds allies fails hits bottom and -- hardly a spoiler -- ultimately helps himself and others by coming to terms with who he is. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? That ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is also a miraculous mesh of dry comedy-of-manners and silly kids humor only adds to its all-ages appeal as does the risky but ultimately home-run casting of R-rated comic Sarah Silverman as Ralphs little-girl ally Vanellope von Schweetz -- a misfit whose snarky bravado pretty well hides her primal fear that as a software glitch she was never supposed to exist in the first place. Ralph meets her in the candy-coated racing game ""Sugar Rush"" after first leaving his own game -- in which hero Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) races to repair the huge-fisted Ralphs destruction of an apartment building -- and then masquerading as an armored soldier in the first-person shooter ""Heros Duty"" where sexy ramrod Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) leads her men against flying rapidly multiplying Cy-Bugs. When Ralph unknowingly sets that menace loose all of gamedom is threatened. A loving homage to arcade video games with cameos by everyone from the Street Fighters to Sonic the Hedgehog ""Wreck-It Ralph"" blends poignancy and a piston-powered plot that revels in both visual inventiveness and a vaudevillian sense of timing.

Wreck-It Ralph review 80s replay | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWreck-It Ralph review 80s replayDisneys latest 3D animation goes back to the 1980s arcade for the story of misunderstood Wreck-It Ralph.Wreck-It Ralph voiced by John C. Reilly just wants to be a good guy for a change.  (Disney / MCT)  The pre-feature short Paperman is a delight writes Linda Barnard.  (Disney)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Nov. 1 2012Wreck-It Ralph(out of 4)Starring the voices of John C. Reilly Jack McBrayer Jane Lynch and Sarah Silverman. Directed by Rich Moore. 93 minutes. Opens Nov. 2 at major theatres. GWreck-It Ralphs not bad. Hes just pixilated that way.Disneys latest 3D animation takes us back to the arcade for the story of misunderstood basher Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) the villain of an 80s smash-and-build videogame called Fix-It Felix Jr.Article Continued BelowRalphs old-school 8-bit animation -- and cameos by the game stars of yesteryear when Pac-Man fever was in full flush -- will serve as a nostalgic hook for the moms and dads who buy the movie tickets. Theyll love the in-jokes -- both visual and verbal -- that will send them back to the days of acid-washed jeans and afternoons at the arcade.Their little ones will get caught up in the hyper-realism and brilliant colours of the more modern games invented for the flick. Its win-win for Disney even if the movie starts out as a funny high scorer but limps into a second half as flat as those quarters we once pumped into arcade machines long ago.After the machines are turned off for the night inside Mr. Litwaks arcade (which is something of an anachronism in itself) Ralph gives in to dreams of a better life. Hes sick of being a homewrecker and wants to be a good guy just like that darned Felix (voiced with a hopeful grin by 30 Rocks Jack McBrayer).For 30 years Felix has been fixing the fancy apartment building home of the likable Nicelanders as soon as Ralph starts wrecking it. Their hero gets cheers pies and shiny medals while Ralph nets only scorn and fear. Its enough to give a 9-foot-tall 643-pound guy a complex.Ralph shares his angst with the rest of the video game evildoers including Dr. Eggman from Sonic The Hedgehog and Zangief from Street Fighter at a support session Bad-Anon. Held after hours at the arcade and facilitated by Clyde the orange ghost from Pac-Man sorrows can always be drowned later at Tapper.Borrowing from the behind-the-curtain sensibilities of Monsters Inc. the game characters can escape their machines and move from game to game via power ports emptying into Game Central Station. But that freedom isnt without risk as poor Qbert has learned.Inadvertently stumbling into the modern mayhem of new and frighteningly realistic shooting game Heros Duty gives Ralph inspiration to nab a medal of his own after he sees one is up for grabs for the top-scoring player. Hell have to get past pneumatic Space Marine Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) a gal who is packing a nasty attitude and lethal weapons to match. She leads square-jawed platoons in a quest to exterminate vicious mutating Cy-Bugs. A word to parents these scenes are intense and more than a little scary so have a hand ready to offer for younger audience members.Ralph bolts for the candy-coloured world of race game Sugar Rush reluctantly teaming up with smart-mouth shorty Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman making so many duty-doody jokes you want to flush her) to keep his medal and his honour.Its here that Wreck-It Ralph crashes thanks to a sugar overload. And the race games boss King Candy (Alan Tudyk) works a strange effeminate vibe thats kind of creepy.First-time feature director Rich Moore (Futurama The Simpsons) teams with writers Phil Johnston (Cedar Rapids) and Jennifer Lee to give us a cast of characters worried about becoming obsolete or worse locked out of their games. The message that not only is there no place like home but you should be content with your place in it (and not forget how deep the friendship pool runs) comes through loud and clear.Noisy frenetic and colourful Wreck-It Ralph is the kind of popcorn muncher that lures families to the multiplex with a promise of keeping kids quiet for 90 minutes. It doesnt come close to Pixars hallmark of delivering animation with a compelling story and fully developed characters but if your aim is to keep a 10-year-old entertained you could do worse.There is an Easter Egg included thats not hidden in a video game and for that make sure you get settled in seats in time to see the lovely (mostly) black-and-white silent short Paperman. The animation is set in 1960s New York where a paper pusher has a chance encounter with a fellow Manhattan office worker who may just be the girl of his dreams. Helmed by first-timer John Kahrs its pure magic.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

No. Wednesday October 31 2012 at 4 a.m. By Nick Schager 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Its hard out there for a video game villain always being attacked never given the benefit of the doubt and forever pigeonholed into a role no one wants to see you escape. Such is the fate of Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) the bad guy in an old-school arcade game called Fix-It Felix Jr. in which players control sprightly magic-hammer-wielding repairman Felix (Jack McBrayer) mend the damage Ralph has wrought upon a high-rise apartment building and win a gold medal by tossing Ralph off the roof. With gigantic hands a round face and overalls strapped over one shoulder Ralph resembles a human Donkey Kong and after 30 years of his smash-and-growl routine he has grown tired of his station in life. Once the arcade has closed at a therapy session for like-minded scoundrels including Super Mario Bros. Bowser and Street Fighters Zangief and M. Bison Ralph wonders aloud why he cant ever be the hero. A Pac-Man ghost responds ""We cant change who we are.""Wreck-It Ralph the latest non-Pixar animated outing from Disney is a saga rooted in refuting that notion charting Ralphs escape out of his game and into others via the arcades surge protector known as Grand Gaming Central. His goal to win a gold medal that will gain him the acceptance of his sneering peers. With bouncy CG thats given greater depth by 3-D director Rich Moores film blends the secret-lives-of-toys reality of Toy Story with the self-actualization vibe of Bolt with the former proving far more electric than the latter. Theres an invigorating energy to the first 20 minutes with Reillys ho-hum-glum narration hilariously establishing Ralphs discontent and Ralphs travels through the game world marked by one winning cameo after another including 2-D icons Pac-Man (detested by Ralph) and QBert (now homeless). With access to any of the arcades games Ralph is poised for a quest of genre-hopping madness of diverse worlds to explore and clashing styles to confront.Thus its more than a bit disappointing to find Wreck-It Ralph squandering the opportunities it sets up. After an inspired visit to gritty HD sci-fi first-person-shooter Heros Duty nets Ralph his gold medal he finds himself blasted into a candy-land racing game called Sugar Rush. There he meets a little girl named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) who fulfills the dictate for an adorable wiseass child character and he finds himself attempting to retrieve his medal by helping Vanellope--whos a glitch and thus vilified by the rest of her comrades--qualify for the big race against the wishes of King Candy (Alan Tudyk). This turn of events grinds the film to a halt precisely because it confines Ralph for most of the storys remainder to Sugar Rush a milieu far less electric than Ralphs other pit stops and whose villain King Candy comes across as a second-rate slightly more lucid Mad Hatter.Film Details Wreck-It Ralph RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time108 More Info Opting for a consistent locale undercuts the tales whiplash vitality. Fortunately Ralph and Vanellopes spiky kid-adult banter occasionally makes up for this lack of momentum as does a subplot in which Felix--fearful that Fix-It Felix Jr. is about to have its plug permanently pulled because its unplayable without Ralph--teams up with Heros Duty badass Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch) with whom he soon shares inter-game romantic sparks. Whenever it splices together creatures of incompatible digital genera Wreck-It Ralph feels charged with possibility. And its pairing of familiar eight- and 16-bit game characters with fictionalized ones that feel like they could have existed results in an overarching sense of authenticity that makes the films retreats into static be-yourself territory all the more dispiriting.Convinced that hes more than just a ""bad guy"" Ralph finds in Sugar Rush proof that he can determine his own character. In doing so he shows others (Vanellope Felix Calhoun) that they too can be whatever they want to be programming be damned. That pro-autonomy message might have carried more weight if it werent so clearly outlined at the outset and then simply confirmed without complication by Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnstons straightforward script. As with its narrative Wreck-It Ralphs themes dont develop by branching out in wild unpredictable ways; instead they simply become narrower and more monotonous. Perhaps thats the directors canny way of replicating the fundamental nature of 80s-era games like Wreck-It Ralph which were predicted on basic repetitive action.Yet for all the wink-wink inside jokes peppered throughout its quest (the best a nod to the NESs famed secret controller code up-up down-down left-right left-right B-A start) Wreck-It Ralph feels like so many modern AAA gaming titles--a promising starting point for an inevitable improved sequel.

Disney SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Wreck-It Ralph Great 5 stars Director Rich Moore. Cast John C. Reilly Jack McBrayer Sarah Silverman. Rating PG for some rude humor and mild action/violence. InterviewJack McBrayer By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Nov 1 2012 1133 AM ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is smart funny sweet and sassy. And thats just Sarah Silvermans character. The movie is a treat for kids and the parents they drag to see it. Or maybe itll be the other way around. Either way. It doesnt matter how you get to it. Just get there. The story about a bad-guy character in a video game who dreams of being good sounds like something that could be played too cute too precious especially coming from Disney. But John Lasseter the genius behind Pixar is running the animation studio now and his imprint is all over the movie. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" directed by Rich Moore could fit comfortably among the better Pixar films. Ralph (voice of John C. Reilly) is a character in Fix It Felix an arcade game that has managed to remain popular for years even as higher-tech (and more expensive to play) games have taken over the arcade. The gist of the game involves Ralph climbing up a building in Donkey Kong fashion and breaking windows. Then the hero Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) comes along with his magic hammer and fixes the windows while Ralph now on the roof tosses barrels down at him. Like ""Toy Story"" ""Wreck-It Ralph"" imagines a world in which toys or in this case video-game characters have a life separate from their day jobs. Inside Ralphs game everyone loves Felix who lives and parties with other characters in the game in the building Felix fixes. Ralph is relegated to a smelly dump sleeping on a pillow made of bricks. You can move from game to game as long as youre back by morning when the arcade opens. One day Ralph stuns the other members of his AA-like Bad-Anon meeting (members include the ghost from Pac-Man) by telling him that he wants to be good. This isnt just surprising its dangerous If Ralph goes ""turbo"" as the game characters call it it could threaten the story lines of the games until eventually theyre labeled out of order and put out to electronic pasture their characters left homeless. (For instance we see the unfortunate Qbert begging on the digital streets). Undaunted Ralph wants to be a hero. So he goes first to Heros Duty an action game along the Call of Duty line so that he can win a heros medal. Its tougher than he anticipates and he winds up in another game the aimed-at-girls Sugar Rush pursued first by the tough-as-nails Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) who thinks Ralph might have unwittingly brought along a game-eating virus and then Felix whose game wont work without Ralph. Ralph also winds up fighting with and then helping Vanellope von Schweetz (Silverman) a seemingly cute little girl whos also a hilariously scrappy smart aleck. Shes a glitch in the game who wants to win the race the game is based on so that she can be a permanent character -- something that King Candy (Alan Tudyk) desperately wants to prevent telling Ralph itll plunge the game into anarchy. (Believe me this is the short version). The film flies off in all sorts of directions all of them rewarding. But the best trick is how screenwriters Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee bring everything back together even the seemingly least-related elements. Actually theres an even better trick than that. Its how Johnston and Lee play to the strengths of the personas of the actors involved. Ralph is goofy but intense as are many of the characters Reilly plays. Felix is hilariously over-the-top cheerful like McBrayers Kenneth the Page on ""30 Rock."" Sgt. Calhoun is angry and mean like ... well like just about everyone Lynch plays. (The ridiculous wartime cliches she spouts are pretty great too.) But Silvermans Vanellope is the real treat bringing a bracing humor to her little-girl sweetness something Silverman does in much more profane ways in her stand-up act. If you are or have been a video-game fan anytime in the past 30 years youll take extra delight in how characters from various games are used. But even if youre not youll take great delight in ""Wreck-It Ralph"" anyway. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Reilly Sarah Silverman Jack McBrayer Jane Lynch Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture This has been a dreary year for family movies. It was rife with sequels even the most decent of which like Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted were not particularly memorable. The adaptations were gruesome (The Lorax Mirror Mirror). Lively hits like The Avengers were too overwhelming and violent for most young kids. And Pixars Brave didnt fulfill its promise of a new spin on the princess story. But now at the eleventh hour in the eleventh month comes Wreck-It Ralph the most inventive and entertaining family movie Ive seen this year packed with wickedly smart humor and joyful animation. Creatively speaking it is cut from the same appealing cloth as Toy Story with something for boys girls their parents and even those who have never changed a diaper. I was not an easy sell. Although Wreck-It Ralph was executive-produced by John Lasseter the mind behind Toy Story it features an entire set of characters from video games (not all imaginary; Pac-Man is a running joke) and every frame takes place within a video arcade a world I generally find about as enticing and engaging as discussing cigars or dressing a deer. Its the story of a designated bad guy in a video game who longs to be good and Tron-like. Most of the action happens within the machines themselves cleverly depicted as connected by a train service that runs through the power cords. After a long day of destruction over at Fix-It Felix Jr. our antihero Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly doing sublime voice work as the sad but powerful sack) can pop by Root Beer Tapper (circa 1983) for a consoling chat and a beer then board a train at Game Central Station to return to Fix-It Felix Jr. where he sleeps unloved and unappreciated at the dump. His desire to earn a medal and thus the respect of his colleagues -- just like the Cowardly Lion -- spurs his wanderings into other games and the films narrative. (MORE TIME Qamp;A with John C. Reilly) Fix-It Felix Jr. is old school way more Pac-Man than Terminator Salvation. Ralph turns an apartment building into rubble with his Hulk-like fists and then an apple-cheeked Bob the Builder-type called Felix (voiced to perfection by Jack McBrayer from 30 Rock) fixes it with his golden hammer. Residents of the building bounce up and down in gratitude. As a 30-year-old totem of nostalgia the game is in constant peril of being unplugged and discarded. And the first step to that fate -- akin to Toy Story 2s Jessie being left curbside -- is having an out-of-order sign slapped on its screen an act that casts an ominous reddish-yellow glow on the world within. If a character doesnt show up for duty while a human is playing -- if hes say out visiting the fancy high-definition Heros Duty or the Oz-like Sugar Rush as Ralph does on his quest for self-esteem -- the threat of an out-of-order sign looms. Ralph could ruin the game for everyone at Fix-It. Unplugged the best-case scenario for his colleagues would be begging at Game Central Station. (MORE Review of John C. Reilly Movie Cyrus Scary Romantic Comedy) Those who disdain video games might be appalled Now were anthropomorphizing video-game characters? That was my knee-jerk reaction upon seeing the trailer. I got over it mere minutes into the movie when Ralph confesses all at a ""Bad Anon"" meeting led by Pokey from Pac-Man. The way director Rich Moore (whose credits are from television and include The Simpsons and Futurama) working with Jennifer Lee and Phil Johnstons screenplay builds conversation and drama around code viruses and glitches is enthralling not appalling. Visiting Sugar Rush Ralph bonds with the feisty Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced brilliantly by Sarah Silverman potty mouth cleaned up) who is taunted for being a glitch by other avatars. Vanellope periodically freezes and turns into blue pixels; the only hope for her is a reset. But the way these virtual toys struggle for (and achieve naturally) dignity respect and longevity makes for much more compelling entertainment than live-action movies based on video games like Lara Croft Tomb Raider which seem to exist primarily to make it less creepy for gamers to have sexual fantasies about avatars or to make methodical destruction seem more satisfyingly real or both. Wreck-It Ralph is even smart enough to speak directly to parents like me who tsk-tsk over video games. When Ralph sneaks into Heros Duty where armor-clad musclemen led by a hilariously sexy female commander (Jane Lynch) fight bugs in a dystopian setting hes horrified. ""When did video games get so violent?"" he asks. (MORE TIME Capsule Review of Lara Croft Tomb Raider) Theres also a gentle undercurrent of mockery directed at our societal obsession with video games. Perhaps the best of Wreck-It Ralphs visual delights aside from Mentos falling in the Diet Cola Hot Springs are the windows between reality and the games. Moore shows both worlds three dimensionally but each views the other as only two-dimensional. Looking out at the person playing the game Ralph sees flat moving images within a small frame. Ditto for the gamers looking in. As a little girl gazes into a screen with only the audience privy to the lively far more complex world teeming inside the message is And were satisfied with this? Wreck-It Ralph celebrates video games but it also makes a subtle plea for participation in a three-dimensional world. At least thats what Im going to tell myself when I take my PlayStation-Game Boy-Xbox-deprived kid to see it this weekend.

Wreck-It-Ralph (PG) | miami.com Home Events Guides Review Wreck-It-Ralph (PG) This adventure set in the world of video games has something to offer for parents and their kids. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/1/2012 Editor rating 3 The characters in Wreck-It-Ralph all have day jobs They just happen to be characters in video games re-enacting the same roles in the same universe over and over again like stock players in a theatrical company where the play never changes. Some like Mario and Pac-Man and Sonic are heroes; others like the hulking but kind-hearted Ralph (John C. Reilly) are bad guys relegated to smashing and destroying buildings and public property of a popular vintage arcade machine until the player runs out of quarters. But at night when the arcade closes these pixilated creatures dont switch off. They lead lives outside of their respective games. The good guys throw parties and romp and celebrate. The villains attend Bad-Anon meetings which are like AA sessions to help them deal with the strain of having to be bad all the time. The unfortunate characters whose games fell out of fashion and are no longer active hang around like vagrants begging for food. But by morning when the arcade reopens everyone is back in their places ready to be manipulated by joysticks and trackballs and buttons. Part of the fun of Wreck-It-Ralph is discovering how much meticulous detail director Rich Moore has brought to his imaginary world of electronic characters (here truly is a computer-animated movie that makes sense because its protagonists all exist on motherboards). An old 8-bit character stares in awe at a modern high-def warrior in all its glossy shiny detail. Theres a war-themed first-person shooter shown from the inside out that will tickle anyone who has ever spent time playing Call of Duty. Cameos abound around the edges of the frame The filmmakers have as much affection for popular games such as Frogger as they do for less-known titles such as Burgertime. Wreck-It-Ralph was executive produced by John Lasseter the former Pixar honcho who now oversees all of Disneys animation. His presence is felt in the films sense of humor the manic speed of its storyline and the tactile reality of its imaginary world. But aside from the nostalgia factor Wreck-It-Ralph is aimed primarily at kiddie audiences with Ralph sneaking into a Candyland-themed racing game to help a glitchy outsider (Sarah Silverman) who has been brushed aside by her mean-girl competitors become an option kids can choose while playing the game. The movie doesnt resonate the way the best Pixar and Disney movies do and the humor is broad and pitched to young viewers. But the visuals are never less than eye-popping and the video game theme will hold the attention of older viewers even when the story doesnt. Wreck-It-Ralph is a gorgeously rendered story that will play just as well to children as to their parents albeit for different reasons. Playstation and Xbox junkies will be equally pleased.

Send Feedback. Share Tweet For just a moment early on Disneys Wreck-It Ralph looks like its attempting to ape Pixars Toy Story. There are certainly superficial similarities Both animated films initially focus on the relationship between children and their playthings. Both address what those playthings--some of them original creations some of them familiar nostalgia-evoking icons--do in their downtime when no human beings are looking; both draw on the irresistible idea that the rich elaborate lives children imagine for their toys arent an illusion but are just the tip of the iceberg compared to their actual worlds. And given that both films are nominally aimed at kids theres some similarity in the messages about the importance of both being yourself and liking yourself and about the redemptive power of friendship. But Wreck-It Ralph has loftier ambitions than imitating a previous success. Its a wildly exciting ride the fastest-moving most enthusiastically kinetic kids action film since The Incredibles. But its also a surprisingly ambitious crafty gimcrack that piles subplot upon subplot building a teetering tower of ideas that seems more suited to a full season of television than a single feature film. As it turns out its largely an elaborate shell game Time and again the script presents important plot points disguising them as offhand comments or throwaway ideas then reveals their significance at a crucial moment. Eventually this process leads to a glorious collapse of the tower as all the seemingly unrelated or unresolved threads pull together at once. Its a terrific trick and it makes for a film thats both viscerally enjoyable and narratively thrilling. And while the film begins in an arcade where kids gather to play the characters games and it intermittently addresses how the in-game world and the players world interact its much less interested than the Toy Story movies in the importance of human contact. To the videogame avatars of Wreck-It Ralph their game functions are essentially jobs which may be rewarding terrifying or just a daily chore. Where the Toy Story protagonists live for meaningful contact with the kids who own them Ralphs characters are clock-punchers who have to find their own meaning in a much larger richer and more complicated interior world. John C. Reilly stars as Wreck-It Ralph the cranky lunkish villain of a Donkey Kong-meets-Rampage arcade game in which he perpetually smashes a fancy apartment building built atop his former home. The games hero is Fix-It Felix Jr. (30 Rocks Jack McBrayer) a perky handyman who battles Ralph by repairing whatever he smashes. For 30 years Ralph has thrown retributive temper tantrums and chipper Felix has cleaned up the mess at least when their arcade is open and their game is in use. After hours in the much more lavishly rendered shared inner world of videogames Ralph glumly retreats to his solitary home in the dump or to the bar from the arcade game Tapper while Felix hangs out in his newly repaired apartment building enjoying the respect and adulation of its bouncy little inhabitants. (The visual gag contrasting those subsidiary characters smooth modern CGI design with their ultra-jerky 8-bit movement is one of the best subtle jokes of a movie thoroughly packed with them.) Eventually Ralph decides hes tired of his assigned role and wants to be part of the social world of his games and after a disastrous attempt at fitting in he becomes fixated on the idea that hell be accepted if he can just earn a medal like the one his game awards Felix after every successful play. So he abandons his game and steals a medal from a more modern Starcraft-meets-Gears Of War battle game presided over by grim-and-gritty squad leader Sergeant Calhoun (Jane Lynch). Then he loses the medal to perky sprite Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) a driver-wannabe within a nauseatingly cute Japanese-inspired racing-cart game called Sugar Rush where the entire world and most of its occupants are made of candy. (Vanellopes name is pronounced like a blend of ""vanilla"" and ""Penelope""; most of the other racers in her game somewhat resemble Strawberry Shortcake characters and have distinct flavor themes.) Events in both those locales spawn ongoing storylines which Wreck-It Ralph aptly juggles long enough that its enticingly impossible to tell at times what the movie is really about. Meanwhile since Ralph isnt present to wreck things in his own game the arcade owner (Ed ONeill) decides the machine is on the fritz and plans to junk it so Felix heads out to find Ralph and bring him home to save their little world. Wreck-It Ralph rivals Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World for the sheer number of videogame in-jokes. It would take many viewings to sort out all of the background characters licensed from other games though some of them get significant screen time--particularly Pac-Man and his orange-ghost enemy Clyde Street Fighters Zangief and the entire displaced and homeless cast of Qbert. A handful of established videogame talents also turn up to voice characters theyve done in the past Roger Craig Smith as Sonic The Hedgehog Gerald C. Rivers as M. Bison and more. Theres a cute use of the Konami Code and the occasional cutaway from the videogame inner world into what people might see on the arcade machines screen. And there are any number of non-videogame references as well ranging from a ridiculous but adorable Wizard Of Oz visual joke to Firefly/Dollhouse star Alan Tudyk voicing Sugar Rushs daffy mostly affable King Candy in direct imitation of chortling Disney vet Ed Wynn (the Mad Hatter from 1951s Alice In Wonderland and Uncle Albert in Mary Poppins). Various events and significant moments throughout the film are noticeably reminiscent of movies from The Iron Giant to Shrek to Who Framed Roger Rabbit. And yet all the familiarity doesnt keep Wreck-It Ralph from finding its own tone a Pixar-worthy mixture of authentic feeling and reckless joyful energy. First-time feature director Rich Moore is an animation-industry veteran whose directorial credits include more than 70 Futurama episodes a stint on The Critic and dozens of early Simpsons episodes including the nigh-unbeatable ""Marge Vs. The Monorail."" His directorial work on tearjerkers like Futuramas ""Jurassic Bark"" and The Simpsons ""Lisas Substitute"" proves his capacity for juggling humor and pained pathos both of which are in evidence here. And screenwriters Phil Johnston (Cedar Rapids) and Jennifer Lee have produced a structure unusual for a kids film one where the storys seemingly obvious primary goal gets obscured along the way subsumed into new goals and at times lost entirely among terrific setpieces like the ""mini-game"" where Ralph and Vanellope design a candy racing car together. The way the film wanders through in-jokes and narrative byways without losing its relevance or momentum is half its appeal. The way it remains coherent consistent and compelling throughout though is a marvel. Its tempting to ascribe at least some of the credit to Disney execs and Pixar vets John Lasseter and Ed Catmull particularly since Wreck-It Ralph has such a consistent balance of the elements that make the best Pixar films a sense of heart and of thoroughly earned emotion combined with a rip-roaring pace and a fantastic attention to detail. Sugar Rushs absurd candy-constructed world is particularly stunning but the conscious effort to differentiate the different types of games is well-observed and sometimes hilarious. Every moment of the film feels thought-out from the way characters change designs when visiting other games to the way Sergeant Calhoun clears her throat and visibly snaps into character mode before delivering her standard introduction to the player whos just inserted a quarter into her game. That kind of focus the attitude that no line of dialogue is wasted and no visual detail is unimportant makes Wreck-It Ralph more than another standard cutesy reference-fest with some exciting chases and an eventual upbeat message. It gives it the kind of depth that creates new worlds and makes them seem plausible and suggests the boundless potential just on the other side of that glass arcade screen. Note Wreck-It Ralph screens with a charming seven-minute animated short ""Paperman."" Its a strange fit with the feature--a magical-realist black-and-white romantic fantasy that visually evokes old-school Disney cel animation and 50s cinema. Its the proof-of-concept piece for a new software suite that blends CGI modeling and hand-drawn art producing a classic Disney look but with beautiful depth and shading. Kids may not go for its mildly offbeat boy-meets-girl swooning but its a lovely piece visually and the innovative technique makes it a likely candidate for this years Best Animated Short Oscar.

"Wreck-It Ralph | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wreck-it-ralph ) Wreck-It Ralph (United States 2012) October 31 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli With Wreck-It Ralph the video game/movie synergy is complete. Heres a movie that isnt based on a video game; it literally takes place within the world of video games. The concept is a little like that of Toy Story the characters in video games have existences of their own and once the arcade is closed they can roam around even crossing over into other games. Wreck-It Ralph never does anything groundbreaking with this idea but its cute and clever and evokes nostalgia for gamers of the 80s and 90s. The story is standard-order animated fare about a character discovering his inner hero but all the references to video game titles from 20 years ago (or more) provides a strong layer of appeal to older viewers. Wreck-It Ralph (voice of John C. Relly) is the antagonist of a simple early-80s style game that bears a resemblance to Donkey Kong. In this scenario Ralph is DK (before he became the hero in Nintendos 90s franchise) and Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer) is a Mario clone. The games straightforward goal is for Felix to make it to the top of the building without getting knocked off by objects tossed at him by Ralph. For 30 years these characters have been at it day-in and day-out while many of the games surrounding them have come and gone. Now after all this time Ralph has begun questioning his role in the order of things. He no longer wants to be the bad guy who gets thrown off the roof at the end of every loss. He wants to taste the good life. So he heads off into another game Heros Duty to win a medal. Once that is achieved however he takes an inadvertent detour into Sugar Rush on his way home. There an annoying little girl named Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) steals his medal and uses it to pay the fee to enter a cart race. Determined not to return until he has reacquired his medal Ralph inadvertently risks destabilizing two games (Fix-It Felix and Sugar Rush) and having them turned off. The production design alone betrays familiarity with the simple 8-bit arcade hits of the 80s and their slightly more sophisticated home console descendants of the 90s. Fix-It Felix is a dead-on imitation of many of the most popular arcade games of the early 80s. First-person shooters are represented by Heros Duty. Sugar Rush is a mash-up of console platformers and cart racing games. There are ""cameos"" by the likes of Pac-Man Bowser Qbert and Sonic the Hedgehog. Terms like ""power ups"" ""boss battle"" and ""hidden bonus level"" are in the movies vocabulary. There are also plenty of retro sounds and visual effects - enough to make anyone a little teary-eyed for the days of yore. Wreck-It Ralph can be watched like any other Disney movie; it has the necessary structure and narrative drive. Ralph is a Despicable Me-type hero - a bad guy who ends up being heroic. The films emotional core comes from his friendship with Vanellope. The settings are colorful and the pace brisk. But theres a whole other ""meta"" level to the way the film plays out. One wonders whether there will be a game based on Wreck-It Ralph (the movie). Talk about recursion... The 3-D in Wreck-It Ralph is neutral. Theres nothing in it that in any way detracts from the viewing experience. The brightness levels have been adjusted theres no evidence of motion blur and the images appear crisp and sharp. However while watching Wreck-It Ralph I mostly forgot it was in 3-D. This is a great example of how the format can be used subtly but its hard to argue that a minimalist approach is worth an extra 3 or 4. Just as the film gains little by being seen in 3-D so it loses little in 2-D. Putting aside Tim Burtons Frankenweenie which is an animal of a different sort (black-and-white stop-motion) Wreck-It Ralph is probably the most effective animated family offering thus far in 2012. Unlike several of the earlier big-budget productions it remembers that there might be a few audience members over the age of 9. Theres something very old fashioned about the core ingredients of Wreck-It Ralph; these blend well with the ""hip"" elements. Still I cant help but wonder whether this is all just one big product placement for something aimed at the home video market. It seems like a game designers wet dream.

"Review Wreck-It Ralph a delightful romp - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Wreck-It Ralph a delightful rompBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 10/31/2012 120000 PM PDTUpdated 10/31/2012 060459 PM PDTIn his heart and soul Wreck-It Ralph is a good guy -- even if he is a 9-foot hulk with massively oversized hands and a propensity for destroying everything he touches. In fact he is a sensitive sort who wants nothing more than to be invited to a party and maybe have a piece of cake.The problem for Ralph is that he is the villain in a 1980s-era arcade game called ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" (think ""Donkey Kong"") in which his job is to wreak havoc on a building so Felix the good guy can rebuild it. Every time a kid drops a quarter in the machine its the same thing -- over and over again.No wonder Ralph complains ""Its hard to like your job when no one loves you for doing it."" Finally after a meeting of arcade game bad guys (ghost from ""Pac-Man"" Zangief from ""Street Fighter"") enrolled in the ""Bad-Anon"" support group Ralph decides hes had enough. Hes going to be a hero even if it means bolting his game for another one -- a decided no-no in game world.And with that were off on the delightful romp that is ""Wreck-It Ralph"" a new Disney toon that busts the studios normal formula and embraces the edge and smarts of a Pixar film (John Lasseter of Pixar executive-produced). Its adult-friendly for those who avoid the sugar rush of modern-day Disney flicks and a great visual treat for the kids with just enough low comedy to keep them laughing.Advertisement What is particularly good about ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is how director Rich Moore (""The Simpsons"") and screenwriters Phil Johnston (last years very funny ""Cedar Rapids"") and Jennifer Lee build an entire world with its own cultures and rules. Each of the games in the arcade for example is connected through Game Central Station i.e. a power strip with surge protectors acting as security guards. You can jump into another game although almost no character does because if you ""die"" there you dont come back to life. Worse theres a good chance that if you die while going rogue the rest of your game will die too.So its a big deal when Ralph decides he needs a medal for heroic deeds to make himself popular with the folks of ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" and makes a break for ""Heros Duty."" Its a newer one-person shooter game with a lot of violence as space marines led by a female sergeant named Calhoun fight a never-ending battle against nasty cyberbugs.Ralph gets his medal but he also gets thrown into yet another game along with one of the cyberbugs. Its a Candy Land-style go-cart affair called ""Sugar Rush"" which also has overtones of ""The Wizard of Oz."" There he meets Vanellope von Schweetz a character with serious tude which may be explained by the fact that she is a ""glitch"" in the games programming.Its the relationship between these two outsiders that gives ""Wreck-It Ralph"" a firm emotional core with their determination and strong bond leading to the movies satisfying conclusion.The writing by Johnston and Lee is funny smart and pop culture-savvy particularly when it comes to including cameo appearances by game characters ranging from Sonic the Hedgehog and Qbert to the little-remembered Tapper. Moore and his crew do a fine job of meshing the visual styles of the various games with the look of the characters when they are off duty.In addition the voice cast is pitch perfect. John C. Reilly is splendid as Ralph and Sarah Silverman brings sass (and more than a bit of rude humor) to Vanellope. Jack McBrayer (Kenneth on ""30 Rock"") gives Felix more depth than you might expect and Jane Lynch takes her Sue Sylvester to a whole different level with Calhoun. Perhaps the best work comes from Alan Tudyk (TVs ""Suburgatory"") as King Candy the ""ruler"" of ""Sugar Rush"" who comes off as a slightly demented cross between Ed Wynn and Frank Morgan in ""Wizard of Oz.""In the end ""Wreck-It Ralph"" comes up a little short when it comes to the depth of storytelling that Pixar brings to its best work. But its a fine piece of moviemaking that has a little something for kids who dont remember when games were played in arcades and adults who will delight in the tweaking of a bygone era.wreck-it ralph    Rating PG (for some rude humor and toon violence)Voice cast John C.

Reilly voices a video game character tired of being a villain (Disney) B+ Wreck-It Ralph Genre Animation; Starring Jane Lynch John C. Reilly Sarah Silverman; Release Date Wide 11/02/2012; Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Posted November 9 2012 -- 1200 AM EST Nostalgia has been digitized. In Wreck-It Ralphs byte-size universe of arcade games a pixelated panoply of characters (both copyrighted and made-up) commingle each day after the final quarter has been dropped. But for Ralph the bulldozer-handed villain of the 1980s arcade relic Fix-It Felix Jr. life isnt all power-ups and extra lives. An 8-bit brute with a heart of gold Ralph (voiced with hangdog perfection by John C. Reilly) escapes his game on a quest to prove to the world that theres more to him than just being bad. As the well-meaning Fix-It Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer) and a rough-and-tumble space soldier (Jane Lynch) pursue him Ralph ends up in Sugar Rush a racing game set in a confectionary wonderland of cotton-candy clouds peppermint forests and innumerable dessert puns of varying tastiness. There he encounters a young racer named Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) whose glitchy nature invites the ire of the crazed Ed Wynn soundalike King Candy (Alan Tudyk). The story itself risks getting overly sweet at this point but miraculously it never melts into a syrupy wash. There are more videogame cameos and winks than you can shake a Wiimote at -- even the Konami Code the gamers paternoster makes an appearance -- but the real success of the film is its emotional core and the relationship between the two misfits. It doesnt quite carry the heft of Toy Story but theres a lot of heart packed into these zeroes and ones. B+ Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Boasting an innovative premise offering up a whimsical style and featuring excellent characters this is a treat for children and adults alike. If you like movies games well-executed family films or comedy youll find much to enjoy here. Essentially and crucially this is a very diggable film. Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) is the bad guy in ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" an arcade game thats physically located smack dab in the middle of an ocean of racing shooting and retro games. Ralphs days are rote and unimaginative. Hes always wrecking things - thats his role within the game - so he never gets any invites to the hip soirees. Felix (Jack McBrayer) is a nice enough hero within Ralphs world but thats the precise issue hes the hero that Ralph will never be allowed to even aspire to be. ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is what happens when Ralph stops wrecking things ... and starts getting real. Theres a bad guy therapy group a Grand Central Station where all the video game characters congregate and some legitimate internal logic to the world of the film as in if you die outside your approved game you gulp die for all-time. And then your game gets mothballed Egads certainly but this is the world Ralph finds himself immersed in - he badly wants to be the hero but lacks the appropriate gear with danger lurking around every pixelated corner. So whats a bad guy to do? Ralph game jumps and this is where the film gains huge momentum as his quest to become ""good"" will lead him directly to Vanellope (Sarah Silverman) and the game shes a ""glitch"" in appropriately named ""Sugar Rush."" Vanellopes game is a teeny-bopper racing effort but shes having a similar issue - she cant even get into the competition Ralph and Vanellope team up to great comedic effect and ""Wreck-It Ralph"" soars from there. What definitely clicks with ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is the game within the game - when youre not being treated to gaming references youre being inundated by punchlines. This leads to approximately zero percent of the film coming off as slow or boring. This is the rare film that works on about four different levels. Fans of video games will find approximately a billion Easter eggs to enjoy here. From ""Street Fighter"" to King Koopa this one has more in-references than a comic-con. The world of ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is dynamic and though there are jokes in abundance they dont come at the expense of the plot momentum. Silverman adds huge amounts to the entertainment quotient her smart alec delivery contrasting nicely with Reillys earnest nature. While were on the subject of the voicework Jane Lynchs Sergeant Calhoun gives Ariel Belle and Jessica Rabbit a run for the ""foxiest and funniest virtual creation"" title. Sergeant Calhoun plays a similar role to Buzz from ""Toy Story"" her extreme seriousness about her duty juxtaposed nicely against the surreal and often silly animated background. Indeed all four of the primary voice actors are exceptional here providing yet another feather in ""Wreck-It Ralph""s already burgeoning cap. As such this is a movie youll want to witness in the cinema the bright colors and brighter themes providing maximum captivation. This feels for all the world like a Pixar classic even though its a Disney movie. Clearly the merger has led to some creative intermingling and the short that plays before ""Paperman"" is also vibrant and compelling. Overall ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is as cute as it is clever a truly adorable winner. And who doesnt love an adorable winner?

A wordless black-and-white romance combining hand-drawn and computer animation techniques its a graceful fusion of twenty-first-century wizardry and old-school Disney warmth. By contrast the Mouse House manages only half that equation in Wreck-It Ralph a fluorescent funride through an imagined arcade game universe that bludgeons the viewer with cleverness and state-of-the-art nostalgia but is found rather wanting in the charm department.The premise might seem alien to anyone younger than Sonic the Hedgehog. Ralph (John C Reilly) is the building-demolishing antagonist of a rudimentary 8-bit video game in the Donkey Kong vein. Yearning to be a hero he sets forth into the complex inner universe of the arcade to find an alternative game that can cast him differently. But he finds himself mired in the hot-pink purgatory of girly go-kart race Sugar Rush Speedway where he joins forces with fellow outcast Vanellope (the delightful Sarah Silverman) to play the system at its own game as it were. Theres a lot more than that to this rule-ridden story world but the initial excitement of the films zigzagging between artificial environments soon becomes exhausting particularly with so little human feeling to underpin the dazzling spectacle. Disneys found a lot to play with here but you may find yourself itching to take the controls.

Reilly and Sarah Silverman lead a talented voice cast in this tale of videogame characters who want to be more than the sum of their programming If youve suffered through ""Super Mario Bros."" or ""Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li"" or almost anything from the oeuvre of Uwe Boll you know that videogames have had a hard time transitioning to the big screen. Whats exciting and interactive on your home system somehow turns stiff and unengaging when adapted to a single-path narrative. Perhaps realizing that the problem with videogame movies is that the characters are stuck in an overly proscribed scenario the new Disney animated feature ""Wreck-It Ralph"" shakes out its characters and lets them interact so that the heroes of various different arcade faves can meet over root beers in the Tapper machine while a Pac-Man ghost moderates a 12-step group for villains. One of those bad guys is Wreck-It Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly) a brutish lug with massive forearms and squared-off fingers. Hes spent the last three decades trying to demolish a building in the game Fix-It Felix Jr. only to have Felix (Jack McBrayer) mend things with his magical hammer save the day earn a medal and win the affection of the tenants. When Ralph finds that hes been left out of the 30th-anniversary festivities (they even invited Pac-Man who always devours all of the hors-doeuvres) he sets out to earn his own medal and to overcome his programming as a bad guy. The characters from different videogames mix and mingle in their communal power strip after the arcade shuts down at night so Ralph decides to run away from his game in his quest to become a hero. Along the way he encounters Calhoun (Jane Lynch) the tough-talking squadron leader in a first-person shooter game and Vannelope (Sarah Silverman) an adorable anime-influenced moppet who wants to enter her games go-cart race despite the fact that shes shunned by her peers as a ""glitch."" Life lessons about being true to yourself are learned along the way delivered with all the subtlety of Felixs hammer but ""Wreck-It Ralph"" actually makes us care about these videogame characters and their dreams for a better life. Even when the plot twists and character arcs in Phil Johnston (""Cedar Rapids"") and Jennifer Lees screenplay feel familiar the voice performances particularly from Reilly and Silverman keep things fresh. (And funny too If you thought youd heard every witty reference to ""The Wizard of Oz"" this movie has a new one for you.) Granted if Silvermans adorable-little-girl voice rankles your nerves you may find yourself stretched to the breaking point but she actually manages to find both laughs and pathos in her misunderstood character. And if youre a fan of the comic stylings of the late Ed Wynn youll enjoy Alan Tudyks homage to the legendary character actor in his performance as Vanellopes nemesis King Candy. While the movie is loaded with inside jokes for gamers (e.g. the Fix-It Felix tenants move and talk stiffly in the games totally 80s style while Calhoun has the more lifelike realism of a motion-capture character) you dont have to know Qbert from Centipede to get whats going on here. Its not unlike the situation with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" another film in which disparate animated characters crossed paths with each other for the first time It certainly helped if you knew who Betty Boop was but if you didnt there was still plenty to enjoy. Director Rich Moore (a vet of ""Futurama"" and ""The Simpsons"" making his film debut) takes full visual advantage of the game setting creating a number of eye-popping worlds (ranging from a grim post-apocalyptic terrain to a candy-colored wonderland) even transitioning the Fix-It Felix world from the old-school 8-bit graphics that the players see to the more three-dimensional look of the world as perceived by the characters who live in it. Even if youve never had Pac-Man Fever (and kudos to whoever decided to hire novelty tunesmiths Buckner and Garcia to write a song for the closing credits) ""Wreck-It Ralph"" is a sweet and often hilarious animated adventure that will charm Generations Pong and X-Box alike.

Vanellope is the reject of her game( society) a metaphor for the rejects of society due to a glitch that others in the game perceive to be a threat to her and their world. In the end vanellope is loved and embraced glitch and all with the allusion that the glitch actually gives her a superior advantage in her world.its sad and pathetic that western popular culture has become obsessed with gay storylines and allegories. Why? If this were a truly oppressed group it wouldnt be so over-represented in the media. Im liberal but i resent the fact that homosexuality Is shoved down our throats all the time.

TWITTER Sarah Silverman John C. Reilly and Jane Lynch voice a lively cast of characters in this antic animated 3D adventure. As the fright season begins to give way to the holidays Disney looks to capitalize right out of the gate Nov. 2 with 3D animated comedy Wreck-It Ralph. An homage to classic video-game culture wrapped in an adventurous road movie Ralph is poised to sweep the family-friendly demo in the first few weeks of the month before any significant challengers emerge. Guided by executive producer John Lasseter Walt Disney Animation Studios has clearly devoted significant resources and talent to Wreck-It Ralph recruiting a top-notch cast and a diverse array of animation visual effects and lighting artists to contribute to the distinct and varied vid-game styles. With a mix of retro eye-candy for grown-ups and a thrilling approachable storyline for the tykes the film casts a wide and beguiling net. VIDEO New Wreck-It Ralph Trailer Offers Sonic Yoshi and More Video Game Stars Emulating a lo-res 80s video game Wreck-It Ralph envisions the titular character as the short-tempered sledgehammer-fisted 600-pound bad guy competing against goody-good nemesis Felix in a game located in Mr. Litwaks (Ed ONeill) video arcade thats known as ""Fix-It Felix Jr."" As Ralph (John C. Reilly) tells some fellow evildoers at his first ""Bad-Anon"" meeting hes a reluctant villain tired of always being the culprit who tears down the apartment building inhabited by the Nicelanders who worship Felix (Jack McBrayer) for his superior repair skills. After 30 years of taking the blame Ralphs ready for a change - he thinks maybe if he can earn a medal the Nicelanders might give him some respect and invite them to one of their frequent cocktail parties. Traveling through the arcades power cords and surge protectors Ralph journeys to Game Central Station the gateway to every game in the store. Hearing that first-person shooter challenge ""Heros Duty"" awards a medal for bravery Ralph suits up to join no-nonsense Sergeant Calhouns (Jane Lynch) platoon to battle the Cy-Bugs a nasty computer virus in the form of cyber spiders. Escaping hi-def ""Heros Duty"" with the coveted service medal Ralph crash-lands one of Calhouns spaceships into ""Sugar Rush"" a Candy Land-styled race-car game after hes attacked onboard by a massive Cy-Bug. He quickly loses his citation to pint-sized Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) a little girl determined to compete in one of Sugar Rushs prestigious races. Her bratty attitude and refusal to return the medal which she can use to stake her spot in an upcoming competition enrage Ralph but hes powerless to force the girl to do his bidding. VIDEO Wreck-It Ralph Teaser Trailer John C. Reilly Gets Animated Following an unpleasant encounter with Sugar Rush dictator King Candy (Alan Tudyk) Ralph allies himself with Vanellope in a plan to recover his medal and help the kid win a spot in the race. But first theyll have to in break into the Kings specialized factory and build a competitive race car - and it might be a good idea for Vanellope to actually learn to drive it. Meanwhile Felix has abandoned the Wreck-It Ralph game and the Nicelanders joining up with Calhoun on a quest to retrieve his friend and protect Sugar Rush from the Cy-Bugs before the game gets flatlined. Although the script is an original by Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee with its tortured toy characters facing obsolescence and searching for freedom and meaning it bears a distinct Pixar DNA signature. Johnston and Lee dont stray too far from the Disney template however and although the characters are digital their emotions are very recognizably human. Since Ralph and Vanellope are both outcasts their struggles for acceptance are comfortably similar and familiar. Making his feature film debut Emmy-award winning director Rich Moore (The Simpsons) ably manipulates the action by tantalizingly shifting the characters between game worlds. Effortlessly orchestrating a dizzying variety of visual elements Moore consistently manages to keep the focus on Ralph and his comrades multiplying perils. Visually Pixars influence is also evident in the level of detail lavished on the wide range of quirky characters and nearly every setting and background scene. Fortunately the more sugar-coated sentiments are mostly dialed back in favor of genuine character development and rousing digitally realistic 3D action. PHOTOS Fall Movie Preview 2012 Major New Releases From Spielberg Jackson Tarantino The audiences POV is occasionally represented by a girl who frequents the ""real world"" of Mr. Litwaks video arcade where she interacts with all of the games depicted in the film. Game-play visual elements are used to enhance the impression of actually playing the arcade consoles which can sometimes get distractingly disorienting as the narrative slips in and out of the video arcade setting. An enthusiastic cast lends voice to the characters led by Reilly capably evincing the role of Wreck-It Ralph. His sad-sack sentiments however are frequently overshadowed by the hyperactive and super-snarky Vanellope. Silverman fully inhabits the character marvelously calibrating her voices volume insinuating tone and emotional impact to match the characters antic facial expressions and unpredictable behavior. Tudyk is ridiculously over the top as the punning Mad-Hatter meets Wizard of Oz-like King Candy while McBrayer and Lynch add surprising dimensionality to the increasingly smitten pair of Felix and Calhoun. Editor Tim Mertens modulates the sometimes frenetic pace with brief interludes of introspection and camaraderie that help fill in the characters. Henry Jackmans lively score is supplemented by musical selections from Ramp;B star Rihanna electronica artist Skrillex and classic Kool amp; the Gang among others.

In the tradition of ""Toy Story"" ""Wreck-It Ralph"" imagines the secret lives of childrens playthings only here its videogame characters who come to life after an arcade closes its doors. Tired of being bad a Donkey Kong-style demolition expert quits his destructive day job to become a hero inadvertently wreaking havoc as he travels from game to game in search of redemption. With plenty to appeal to boys and girls old and young Walt Disney Animation Studios has a high-scoring hit on its hands in this brilliantly conceived gorgeously executed toon earning bonus points for backing nostalgia with genuine emotion. From Maleficent to Scar as long as there have been Disney animated movies the villains have stood out as their most memorable characters. Flipping that dynamic a la ""Wicked"" the story team behind ""Wreck-It Ralph"" -- director Rich Moore and scribes Phil Johnston (""Cedar Rapids"") and Jennifer Lee -- decided to position a classic 8-bit baddie as the center of their affectionate homage to the world of videogames. The fun begins at a ""Bad-Anon"" sharing session where various villains have gathered -- in Pac-Mans ghost home of course -- to commiserate about their sorry lot in life. Unlike humans these hard-coded characters dont enjoy the benefits of free will. Instead they have been programmed to be aggressive -- and ultimately beaten by the heroes in their respective games. For Ralph (John C. Reilly a naturally comedic star with a voice ripe for animation) that means being thrown in the mud and having to sleep in the junkyard every night while Fix It Felix Jr. (""30 Rocks"" ultra-peppy Jack McBrayer) parties with the Nicelanders. Lucky for Ralph he can hop the train to Grand Game Central a giant surge-protector terminal where digital creations are free to mingle after dark offering licensed cameos from Qbert Sonic the Hedgehog and Tapper for the benefit of those old enough to remember them. But Ralph mustnt forget the key rule ""If you die outside your own game you dont regenerate ever."" Truth be told there are a staggering number of rules governing the gameplay in ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and one of the toons greatest pleasures comes in how intuitively audiences discover those parameters as the story unfolds. For example Ralphs key ally is a candy-coated ""glitch"" named Vanellope von Schweetz (Sarah Silverman) running loose in ""Sugar Rush Speedway"" a ""Mario Kart""-style racing game set in a literal Candyland. No one really knows what would happen if Vanellope outcast because of her buggy condition were to compete though spritely-voiced Silverman infuses the underdog character with such untamed passion her instant fans cant wait to find out. Of course landing a knockout concept is a cake walk compared to finding the storytelling angle that takes full advantage of the incredible world theyve invented. Under the leadership of executive producer John Lasseter helmer Moore (a ""Simpsons"" vet) and his team begin with the bright idea of paying tribute to retro games find an inspired way in by focusing on an affable antihero determined to make good and then allow auds to sample several games along the way. Ralphs first stop after abandoning the relatively tame ""Fix It Felix Jr."" environment is an intense ""Halo""-esque game called ""Heros Duty"" a quarter-eating first-person shooter console in which no-nonsense Sgt. Calhoun (Jane Lynch) leads troops in a neverending battle against mutant ""cybugs."" The fact that Moore manages to divide the films time between this intense guy-centric game and the super-girly Sugar Rush without alienating the sort of people who would gravitate to either one is a testament to the rock-solid emotional foundation on which the story stands. Couple that with some truly inspired voice casting (none more uproarious than Alan Tudyk as the lisping King Candy) and the ensemble is positively irresistible as in-jokes and saltier-than-usual PG humor keep the laughs coming. While the quick-to-anger Ralph discovers the value of friendship by agreeing to help Vanellope romance sparks between Felix and Calhoun who team up to track down a rogue cybug before it destroys the entire arcade. All four characters are enriched by backstories cleverly revealed over the course of the film (stick through the end credits to hear the ""Fix It Felix Jr."" song that explains why Ralph is so upset as well as AKB48s fizzy J-pop ""Sugar Rush"" theme) and animated in a way that incorporates the limitations of their original lo-fi design while still allowing them to benefit from state-of-the-art CGI including an intuitive use of 3D that enhances dramatic and action scenes alike. The vintage gaming influences permeate every aspect of the production from the 8-bit Disney logo that opens the film to Henry Jackmans dynamic score which supplies a different sound for each world while tipping its hat to Koji Kondo and the composers of classic Namco and Nintendo themes. The art department clearly had a blast building the various worlds especially the diabetes-inducing Sugar Rush Speedway while character designers responded to the challenge by creating familiar-looking avatars that could entertain in any environment. Making the package even more delightful is John Kahrs black-and-white (with romantic splashes of red) hand-drawn short ""Paperman"" a six-minute mood-setter about a gangly paper-pusher who meets the single gal of his dreams on the train and spends the rest of the day trying to get her attention using the only tool he has a million paper airplanes. Christophe Becks score is the cherry on top this slice of animated perfection.
