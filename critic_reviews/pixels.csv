Entertainment The Geek Fantasy Its Time To Banish Why these new gamers-save-the-world stories arent actually about geek empowerment. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Michelle Monaghan Adam Sandler Josh Gad and Qbert in Pixels. Sony Pictures ID 6369441 Pixels is about how Adam Sandler saves the world from invading aliens using the skills and know-how he picked up playing arcade games.As premises go it isnt more outlandish than those of Sandlers other movies in which hes played the favorite son of Satan a guy able to control time using a magic remote control and nightmarishly his own twin sister. Sandler has been turning out the high-concept low-commitment comedies for two-plus decades even though he seems less engaged each time -- were a long way from the anarchic energy of Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. And there are scenes in the surreally lazy occasionally funny Pixels in which Sandlers face slips into the exact same weary disgruntled expression he wears in Funny People in which he played a comedian trying to distance himself from the broad inane films that made him famous.The idea of extraterrestrials attacking in video game form is more than just a viral video concept thats been inflated into Sandlers latest pean to arrested development. Its having a moment courtesy of how Pixels has intersected with the release of Ernest Clines Armada earlier this month a book with a strikingly similar premise. But where Pixels uses its setup of grown arcade rats as unlikely heroes for comedic action sending Pac-Man rampaging through Manhattan and offering up a cowering Qbert as a prisoner of war Armada is very serious about how its 18-year-old protagonist Zack Lightman becomes humanitys savior using the skills hes built up over years of obsessive gaming. View this image > Crown Publishing ID 6369446 Armada is the second novel from Cline the author of the best-selling nerd tome Ready Player One and one of the screenwriters of Fanboys. It is a work of earnest exhausting fandom that ties itself into influences and predecessors like Enders Game and Star Wars with the care of an academic tract. Pixels directed by Mrs. Doubtfires Chris Columbus and co-written by frequent Sandler collaborator Tim Herlihy is more like a bro in nerds clothing offering up a shrugging barrage of 80s references in hopes some will stick.And yet both end up doing the same maddening thing which is find the point where geeky affirmation becomes barefaced pandering and blow right past it. These are not stories about how underdog nerds save the world. They are stories in which world destruction has been carefully arranged to give its heroes a chance to prove themselves special.Both Pixels and Armada are clear on how their protagonists gaming skills havent yielded real-life benefits. Brenner the character Sandler plays in Pixels made it to the 1982 arcade world championships before losing out to a preening mulleted guy whos played as an adult by a very entertaining Peter Dinklage. As a grown-up himself Brenner is divorced installs home electronics and isnt even a gamer anymore -- but he still declares himself a nerd when he gets turned down by a customer Violet (poor Michelle Monaghan) whom he labels a snob. ""Im an amazing kisser. All us nerds are because we appreciate it more"" he tells her.Violet not long after this is revealed to be a DARPA scientist which by any classical definition would make her the nerd and an apparent genius one at that given her convenient ability to whip out anti-alien weapons in little to no time. But Pixels is not about genuine nerdiness as it might pertain to someone smart shy or with obsessive interests. When Brenner uses that term what he means is that hes someone who doesnt feel appropriately appreciated for who he is -- that he knows hes great and Violet should kiss him even though he admits he didnt bother to brush his teeth that morning. View this image > Sandler and Gad in Pixels. Sony Pictures ID 6369452 As the movie unfolds and as the aliens arrive having interpreted the contents of an 80s NASA time capsule as a declaration of war Brenner gets to not just be the hero but to be the man lecturing Navy SEALs on the nuances of Asteroids and getting toasted by a bar full of soldiers. ""Ive never been happier or more alive"" he yells while shooting his way through a giant version of Centipede. He Eddie (Dinklage) and Ludlow (Josh Gad) get custom uniforms; a gala is thrown in their honor in between alien attacks; Eddie demands Serena Williams as his date -- and gets her ""Im just a loser whos good at old video games"" Brenner says as the universe hes in assures him this is the most important thing he could possibly be.Zack from Armada is unlike Brenner still a teenager though hes also mired in 80s pop culture ephemera thanks to his obsession with the father he never knew. Zacks eponymous game of choice is a space combat simulator at which hes become good enough to earn a top ten spot of which hes proud while admitting the time hes put in has hurt his grades and cost him his girlfriend. Like Brenner Zack is recruited and immediately promoted above actual soldiers when the aliens attack. He gets a nifty uniform of his own (""I actually looked pretty sharp like an intrepid young space hero"") and while theres little time for galas in Armada which has a much higher body count than Pixels he arrives at base to find his favorite snacks (Lucky Charms no milk) already laid out for him.Like Brenner Zack knows better than the military leaders he clashes with and also like Brenner (""We Will Rock You"") Zack (""Another One Bites The Dust"" ""One Vision"") takes his gaming soundtrack with a lot of Queen. The two have no interest in making games which just emphasizes its not authorship or the industry theyre interested in -- its being the best at playing. Theyre both convinced theyre destined for greater things even if Brenner has longer to wait. View this image > Pixels. Sony Pictures ID 6369456 Pixels and Armada are descendants of movies like The Last Starfighter and War Games Armada explicitly so. But they flail against an absence of oppression. Neither Sandlers movie nor Clines book can really muster up an argument for its main character as a misunderstood representative from a maligned subculture because both are set in a modern world in which gaming is a billion-dollar industry and a mainstream form of entertainment. Armada does cough up one 80s-style bully who calls Zack a ""videogame nerd who cant get laid"" but the story quickly counters this claim by having a military aircraft land on school grounds in front of all Zacks classmates (including his ex) to zip him away to training where he immediately bags a fantasy girl won over by his in-game rankings.Its a moment in which the underlying sentiment in Armada as well as Pixels shines through and its not actually one of geek affirmation or nerd triumph -- an inarguable point in our age of Comic Con and Marvel movies in which were all some degree of nerdy. No its a more ordinary and less inclusive sort of wish fulfillment that streak of ""someday youll be sorry"" that has nothing specific to do with being a gamer or being a geek and everything to do with the feeling of deserving more respect and appreciation. View this image > Serena Williams and Dinklage in Pixels. Sony Pictures ID 6369466 Its a recognizable human sentiment if an unpretty one that desire to be celebrated and rewarded for some hidden greatness thats going unrecognized -- greatness that in the case of Pixels and Armada the main characters have conveniently achieved in their own time the work already done. Genre fiction is filled with underdog characters who manage heroics but those stories are about what they go on to do strengths they find journeys they make the things they achieve not the indulged hobbies they already have. Maybe its time to give this self-congratulatory idea a rest -- at least until were ready for a story in which the only person who can save the world is one with an unprecedented ability to mainline multiple seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer on Netflix in a single sitting living only off of pints of Haagen-Dazs.

The right touchstone can make the most discerning movie-goer forgive a film as lazy as ""Pixels."" Almost. Most of the pleasures of ""Pixels"" -- Adam Sandler and Kevin James new family comedy -- come from its arcade game hook. All of its annoyances hail from exploiting that fact. The movie opens in 1982 with Cheap Tricks ""Surrender"" blasting. Friends Sam and Will head to the new video arcade where Sam proves to be a pattern-recognition whiz. Lickety-split hes going up against Eddie ""The Fireblaster"" a blow-hard with an accent and a shapely entourage in a world competition. Unlike the stars Peter Dinklage brings some acting to this toss-off. Will (James) grows up to be president which in light of the broadening GOP field seems possible. Best friend Sam (Sandler) becomes a Nerd Brigade technician. Michelle Monaghan is cast in the ridiculous role of love interest/naval honcho. All of this setup is rushed in order to get to the battles between the adult ""arcaders"" and the video game characters sent by aliens to vanquish Earth. Those game-on battles are pretty cool. And almost all of the old-school games get their due Centipede Galaga Donkey-Kong Space Invaders. Playing against type PAC-MAN makes a wild appearance leading to one of Sandlers best lines. And QBert steals the show. A movie like ""Pixels"" was just begging for DPTV crossover.

Mankinds extinction is nothing a few cheap 80s references a slovenly attitude and some celebrity cameos cant fix.A tired-looking Sandler plays a former video game whiz who now installs home entertainment systems and is generally down on his luck. His childhood friend played by Kevin James grew up to become President of the United States because this is an Adam Sandler movie and of course Kevin James is the President of the United States.Together they team up with a pair of fellow video game nerds to ward off an alien race who communicate through 1980s iconography -- Max Headroom ""Fantasy Island"" etc. -- and send real life versions of old arcade games down to wreak havoc on Earth.And because Sandlers character and his pals studied the patterns of those old school games -- they were the only ones who did apparently -- they are uniquely qualified to save the world. All those smart people with their fancy degrees and those stuffy military types? Theyre foolsLike most Sandler movies ""Pixels"" is proudly defiantly lowbrow a dismissal of intelligence that lazily celebrates schlubs and everyday Joes. Its references and soundtrack are locked in the 1980s territory Sandler more successfully mined in ""The Wedding Singer"" which may leave younger audiences scratching their heads. (Do kids know Qbert?)The bright spot is Peter Dinklage who plays a Billy Mitchell-type rock star video gamer and sleazebag. Wearing his hair in a hideous mullet Dinklage delivers all his lines in the cadence of an Ramp;B loverman and effortlessly steals the show whenever hes on screen.Not that anyone else is trying that hard. In Sandlers world effort is for losers and at this point hes stopped trying to win.agrahamdetroitnews.comgrahamoramaPixels GRADE C-Rated PG-13 for some language and suggestive commentsRunning time 106 minutes 8 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1RXAbho MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/07/24/movie-review-pixels/30611861/,200,pixels2,pixels,detroitnews
"Pixels | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pixels ) Pixels (United States 2015) July 24 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Adam Sandler slide continues. Sandler once a box office giant whose stock has plummeted in recent years no longer seems capable of making a watchable movie. His latest Pixels an homage to the early 1980s video game craze offers an appeal to nostalgia to go along with little else. The screenplay is arguably the most brain-dead high concept tripe to come out of Hollywood since the original Transformers. Sandlers brand of brash comedy is neutered to the consistency of diarrhea by the constraints of the PG rating. The ""characters"" vary from slightly annoying to unbearable - this is a film in which a viewer can be forgiven for rooting for the old video game icons to annihilate humanity. God help us if the best savior we can muster is Sandler. The premise for Pixels doesnt sound like it could support a feature film and it proves unable to. Aliens intercept video footage of a 1982 video game tournament and use giant recreations of Pac Man Donkey Kong Centipede Galaga etc. as part of a plan to conquer Earth. Its up to Sandler and his cohorts to take them on. Thinking about the logic of that may cause a brain aneurism. In fact watching the movie may cause a brain aneurism if you can stay awake long enough. Im not sure who thought this was a good idea and who greenlighted it. The film has zero appeal for anyone who isnt an (older) die-hard gamer. And how many (older) die-hard gamers are going to venture to a movie theater to see it?  Worse still the nostalgia allure is polluted by Sandler whose mugging for the camera becomes as tiresome as his unfunny attempts to tone down his crass humor to family friendly levels. Even Kevin James whom I normally like is a square peg in a round hole looking like Chris Christie searching for a buffet table. The expectation in some quarters might be that the special effects would at least give Pixels a degree of visual appeal. Unfortunately the computer-generated imagery appears to be more cut rate than cutting edge. Its sloppy and garish - as if the graphic designers Lite Brite had a seizure. Yes the 8-bit representations populating early 80s video games were blocky but its possible to poke fun at this without making the results so ugly. (See Wreck-It Ralph for a primer on how to do this.) Paying to see this in 3-D is just throwing good money after bad. The films so-called ""action"" scenes which feature Sandler and co-stars James Peter Dinklage Michelle Monaghan and Josh Gad using big guns to zap the invaders are contrived to the point that its impossible to become engaged. Everything is visual graffiti with no point. Even the worst movies usually make an attempt vague and vain though it might be to make sense but Pixels seems proud of its inanity. The ""dramatic""  and ""romantic"" sequences are so cringe-worthy that they made me long for the love scenes between Padme and Anakin. Sandler and director Chris Columbus might think theyre honoring the classic console age. In fact theyre making everyone heave a sigh of relief that we have moved on. This is what happens when Hollywood starts out with a bad idea miscasts all the roles and executes everything badly in production and post-production. Game over.

"Put a Ring on It Jake Gyllenhaal Fights for Love in Southpaw While Adam Sandler Fights Donkey Kong in Pixels << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Put a Ring on It Jake Gyllenhaal Fights for Love in Southpaw While Adam Sandler Fights Donkey Kong in Pixels The Weinstein Company Movies July 24 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Sometimes you want to see an actor leave everything on the floor. Were sadists that way we moviegoers. But when the acting is as masochistic as Jake Gyllenhaals is in Southpaw you wish hed keep a little something for himself. He plays a Hells Kitchen light heavyweight champ and whenever he opens his mouth you half-expect one of the DJs from Hot 97 to blast an air horn. (That accent is where somebody thinks hip-hop lives.) Gyllenhaal has made himself intimidatingly fit. The muscles on his fatless body ripple. The veins and striations form an interstate coursing with God only knows. His big eyes go Powerball crazy. If hes playing king of the boxing world Gyllenhaal makes sure the throne doubles as an electric chair. This weve been told is actors acting the explosiveness the training that accent. But one reason to wish Gyllenhall had gone for 7 or 8 out of 10 instead of 14 is that the movie isnt very good. To his credit this isnt the sort of performance designed to transcend a film; its meant to complement it. The movie written by Kurt Sutter and directed by Antoine Fuqua takes almost every boxing cliche imaginable but doesnt combine or stir them up. Each banality just sort of paces shamelessly back and forth flashing at you like a body in a red-light district. Gyllenhaals character Billy has just won his 43rd fight and his wife Maureen (Rachel McAdams) thinks thats a good number at which to hang it all up. Shes worried about his health and wants their 10-year-old bespectacled daughter Leila (Oona Laurence) to have a father. But Billys being taunted by a young upstart and at a banquet where Billy has just mumbled his way through a speech the kid and his crew take their shot -- and not just with their fists. A sloppily shot and edited melee ensues the fallout of which leaves Billy collapsed into addiction. He disobeys his wife and takes a fight for money (hes been overspending) then hits a referee during a bout and winds up losing his money home and family -- and has to you know fight his way back not just to the top but to Leila who gets sucked into the foster care system where she pretends to be better off. On one of Billys visits a friend asks ""Is that your dad?"" Leila does her best impersonation of an aggrieved girlfriend and answers ""I dont know anymore."" Later she slaps him and says she wishes he were dead. (Theres more where that came from.) Every time you think this guy has reached bottom the movie plunges him through yet another floor. The climb up requires a gym and a trainer and a job. Thank goodness for Tick Wills (Forest Whitaker) whos able to provide Billy with all three. Messy old Tick is all washed up as a fighter which makes him ideal to turn his life over to Billy. Hes not just a rung to recovery; hes the whole ladder. Tick gives Billy all the skill hes never had including rhythm and good defense surprising weaknesses for a titleholder who when the movie starts had never lost a fight. Anyway Billy gets clean gets fit and tries to get beyond supervised visitation. Fuqua brought us Training Day and The Equalizer titles that easily apply to this new movie. ""Southpaw"" of course refers to Billys left hand and he deploys a last-minute in-ring head fake that sends ringside commentators Jim Lampley and Roy Jones Jr. into a tizzy. It must be said that this seems like an awful lot of movie just to discover that this guy can hit with his left. And Billys training sequences are canned into a montage that feels like a poor excuse to dump a new Eminem song into the soundtrack. (On the other hand the score is by James Horner who died in June. The movie has been dedicated to him and its the films most elegant touch.) Otherwise Fuqua seems content to make everything as basic and obvious as possible and Sutter who brought us the biker melodrama of Sons of Anarchy has cut-rate notions of emotional manipulation. (Dammit his is a custody battle fight drama) I dont know how you make an original boxing movie anymore. I dont think the first boxing films were all that fresh. Even in 1931 The Champ must have seemed old-fashioned. But there was natural pathos in its hoariness. In taking from evoking or just failing to think past that movie and about a dozen others Southpaw just makes this one seem tired. Its idea of pathos is mechanical and its depiction of an elite white boxer pads a Hollywood romance that no longer aligns with the reality of a sport that for 50 years has been dominated by black men and Latinos. (Andrew Lindsay explored this preoccupation in his book Boxing in Black and White A Statistical Study of Race in the Ring 1949-1983.) But what Sutter and Fuqua are doing with Southpaw feels like trolling. They dont even make Billy Italian American or ethnically Irish Hes just an orphan The black characters are here to support the white ones. (Naomie Harris plays a foster care administrator whose sole job it seems is to nanny Leila. 50 Cent plays Billys manager who knows to move on when Billy bottoms out.) And if youre going to make an original movie about a white boxer without setting off certain alarms of disbelief perhaps a name other than Billy ""The Great"" Hope is a good place to start. But this movie doesnt care for decorum. Its possible someone thought omitting the ""white"" after ""great""was a nod to subtlety. This kind of egregiousness threatens to upstage Gyllenhaals hard work which in itself is pretty flagrant but honest too. Hes now where Christian Bale was before The Fighter and American Hustle an aggressive mannerist. Hes got a clearer sense of humor and his daring has more than one note in movies like Source Code and End of Watch; he just played nerdy Seymour in a quickie revival of Little Shop of Horrors. But you long to see him take all of that skill and create something soulful or organically weird as opposed to the flamboyant nutjob he came up with for Nightcrawler where the work kept getting in the way. What if he took the lunatic flight that Nicolas Cage took while realizing unlike Cage that one side effect of going out on a limb is that the branch could break? The trouble with how hard Gyllenhaal goes in Southpaw is that hes in the service of weak material so you notice the effort. At some point as Billy Gyllenhaals screaming into a mattress with a gun and a bullet nearby and I found myself thinking Whos going to clean up the snot? Its a blinkered and anguished piece of acting committed to a movie that doesnt deserve it.  IFC Films Theres preposterousness and then there are the movies of Christian Petzold. Petzolds a German whose suspense melodramas -- 2009s Jerichow 2012s Barbara -- hinge on coincidences and plot twists so impossible so desperate that they just work anyway held together by his confidence in his storytelling. You might think his movies are dependent on insane collisions of conveniences. But for Petzold theyre part of a grand moral cosmos. Now hes back with Phoenix the strangest and most ambitious of his three most recent movies. Its also the most devastating in its efficiency and elegance. The story concerns Nelly Lenz (Nina Hoss) a Berlin lounge singer and Holocaust survivor whose horribly disfigured face is surgically reconstructed. The new one eventually looks just like Hoss fine-boned and enticingly big-eyed. This is the kind of movie -- or rather Petzold makes the kind of movie -- in which Nelly learns that Nazis have killed her family but all she wants to know is whether her husband Johannes (Ronald Zehrfeld) made it. You cant believe it but when you get a load of him (he definitely made it) all you can say in distasteful arousal is never mind. Zehrfeld is a strapping hunk with Clark Gables mustache and Gables way of a romantic kind of rudeness. Together before the war he and Nina were a musical duo. Now hes lifting boxes and wiping stuff down at a bar called Phoenix and doesnt recognize this arisen woman. Which is perfect since hes got a proposition His wife died in the camps and he needs someone to pretend to be her in order to collect the inheritance her family left. Nelly consents out of some combination of shock relief and intrigue against the wishes of the friend (Nina Kunzendorf) who has arranged for her new life. Theres no point in explaining where all of this goes. But Petzold is in command of it. By the time you know what hes up to the movies over and youre in a stupor. The endings brilliantly abrupt. Petzold continues the German tradition of melodrama that Rainer Werner Fassbinder took up during his peak in the 1970s and 80. There are many tensions here (sexual conjugal moral cosmetic artistic) that forget to breathe. Petzold mixes up many thrillers and films noir (from Hitchcocks to Georges Franjus) and extracts from them the drama of the double. At the Phoenix a pair of cabaret singers performs as a tandem. At some point a different act is seated at the bar and from behind they appear to be twins. Poor Nelly tolerates the advances of an American soldier only to hear someone inform him that hes caressing the wrong girl. In this second life she goes as Esther the biblical queen who deploys her secret Jewishness strategically. Petzold is having a ball with all of this resurrection and recombination -- and with Johannes who once went by ""Johnny"" exactly the sort of noir name a dame shouldnt trust. The movie itself is a reincarnation of Barbara which was set in 1980 Germany under the watch of the Stasi and in which Hoss and Zehrfeld were lovers in distrust. The deluded omniscience Zehrfeld played in Barbara is a willful obliviousness here. Johannes is so thoroughly convinced by Esther that you have to ask what did Nelly originally look like? Were her voice and demeanor reconstructed too? These are questions that Petzold in his baldness forces you to ask but here you accept the whole scheme -- his hatching it; her going along -- as entwined trauma. Thats all that Hoss is playing aftershock. She has to keep organized the layers of performance and pretending to grasp the order of the masks shes wearing and what it means to let one slip or to remove them entirely. Hoss has to do this while appearing to do very little at all to be hiding behind smiles and frowns. Its warm beautifully intelligent soulful acting thats confident enough to know that her cold stillness can singe. Shes the phoenix yes. But shes also the flame.  Sony Pictures Late-middle-period Adam Sandler is a crank nostalgist. ""Was"" is better than ""is"" adolescence better than adulthood fun better than family and with Pixels 1980s arcade games beat whatever single-player nonsense youre playing on your bed. The conceit is that once upon a time somebody space-launched a capsule loaded with classic video games which some alien race construed as an act of war. Out of plausible options the president (Kevin James) recruits his childhood best friend (Sandler) -- a former arcade-game champion turned lowly home-electronics technician -- to help the military vanquish Galaga and Centipede Pac-Man and Donkey Kong which in 3-D have just the right animated glow and sizzle as they attack live-action D.C. and London. But the movie just feels like a knocked-off Ghostbusters right down to the cheap coveralls and light guns. (Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage fill in the rest of the personnel blanks.) But wheres that movies screwball lunacy? This is just a lot of chomp-chomp-chomp and point tallies wafting upward whenever something game-oriented is blown up. Chris Columbus seems like the ideal director for stakes this low. His expertise is mildness. Im almost never quite as sorry I came to his movies as I thought Id be. Theres usually something. Here there are the threats from the aliens delivered by digitally manipulated 80s-era icons like Ronald Reagan Tammy Faye Bakker and chipper young Madonna. This is the movie at its most inspired. Theres a comic chill of doom in those warnings. Otherwise theres not much else just thoughtless government lacquer. But playing the president is the rare sign that Jamess onscreen self-image might have a capacity for loftiness. He even looks only mildly cowed by his scenes with Fiona Shaw who as the prime minister of England goes whole hog in speaking British gibberish. Dinklage puts on a trashy black-pimp accent and wants to be paid for his services in days and nights with Martha Stewart and Serena Williams. And the older and grouchier Sandler gets the more he seems like deadbeat Humphrey Bogart. To that end Michelle Monaghan as a pathetic divorcee who also happens to be a Defense Department muckety-muck is on hand to play verbal air hockey with him. As the first lady Jane Krakowski is on hand to impersonate air. As if the ho-hum-ness werent enough theres a procedural hypocrisy at work in the nostalgia. Most of the action set pieces are only loosely executed the way youd play say Donkey Kong. When a giant spaceship releases thousands of game characters over Washington the movie becomes the sort of dull shoot-em-up its railing against. Thats a problem only insofar as the movie doesnt actually know what game its trying to play.

Photo Credit AP / Sony Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Classic video game characters invade Earth. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE Often fun and fanciful though kids may not get the endless 1980s references. CAST Adam Sandler Michelle Monaghan Josh Gad Peter Dinklage LENGTH 145 How old are Adam Sandlers fans? A safe bet would be roughly his age which at the moment is 48. The biggest clue came with the success of ""The Wedding Singer"" a 1998 rom-com set during Sandlers formative years in the 1980s. Driven by British synth-pop nuggets and jokes about Michael Jackson jackets ""The Wedding Singer"" became a 123 million hit and Sandler has since made a habit of inserting nostalgic references into many of his movies from ""Grown Ups"" to ""Thats My Boy."" Sandlers latest vehicle ""Pixels"" is yet another ginormous 80s joke. Its about aliens who discover a time capsule from 1982 and get the idea to attack Earth in the form of massive arcade-game icons -- notably Pac-Man Centipede and Donkey Kong. Humanitys best hope is Sam Brenner (Sandler) a one-time video game champ who peaked as a teenager. Along with some fellow nerds from his past Brenner must use his hand-eye coordination skills to save the world. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Sandler excels at playing underappreciated guys like Brenner but the other characters are a mixed bag. Josh Gad as conspiracy nut Ludlow Lamonsoff tends to grate while Peter Dinklage as Donkey Kong champ Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant speaks in a slightly unsettling African-American dialect. Michelle Monaghan playing Lt. Col. Violet Van Patten does what she can as Sandlers love interest. Wearing tailor-made jumpsuits these four arcaders only vaguely resemble the ""Ghostbusters."" Kevin James is likable as their bumbling sidekick Will Cooper who also happens to be the president. ""Pixels"" directed by Chris Columbus is based on a 2010 French short film that lasts just more than two minutes which may explain why this 105-minute version feels both overstretched and underdeveloped. The effects are delightful -- its fun to see Washington D.C. transformed into a giant Pac-Man grid -- but the script by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling feels thin. The aliens are poorly explained All we know of them is that they send threatening messages disguised as Hall and Oates. Those are two of many figures in ""Pixels"" that wont mean much to anyone outside of Sandlers target demographic. Speaking of which Arcaders of a certain age may object to seeing giant Tetris blocks attack a skyscraper. Its a cool idea but that game wasnt created until 1984. ----- FOUR MORE MOVIES WITH A VIDEO GAME THEMEIts game on for ""Pixels"" which hits theaters Friday. The arcade vs. aliens saga is the latest player among movies including these four with a video game theme. advertisement | advertise on newsday TRON (1982) -- A software engineer-turned-hacker (Jeff Bridges) gets thrust into the inner workings of a video game and joins forces with a computer security program called TRON to escape. A box-office disappointment upon its release the movie has become a cult classic and inspired a 2010 sequel ""TRON Legacy."" THE LAST STARFIGHTER (1984) -- It may be game over for an arcade- addicted teen when he is recruited to play his favorite game as part of an alien defense team. Notable as the screen swan song for ""The Music Mans"" Robert Preston. THE WIZARD (1989) -- ""Rain Man"" meets Pac-Man in this tale of a mentally challenged video game prodigy (Luke Edwards) who runs away from home with his brother (Fred Savage) and heads to the West Coast to compete in a video game tournament. WRECK-IT RALPH (2012) -- In this animated Disney flick an unloved video game villain tries to go from zero to hero and in the process nearly pulls the plug on the entire arcade where he lives.

JOHN SEMLEY Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 24 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 24 2015 1125AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Chris Columbus Written by Tim Herlihy Timothy Dowling Starring Adam Sandler Kevin James Josh Gad Michelle Monaghan Peter Dinklage Classification PG Country USA Language English Midway through Billy Madison - the first of many many many Adam Sandler vehicles to cast the pout-faced schlub as blubbering man-child en route to redemption - Sandlers title moron rolls into a high school parking lot in a vintage Trans Am decked out in an REO Speedwagon T-shirt and popped-collar denim jacket blasting Billy Squiers 1981 masturbation anthem The Stroke. Hes met with derisive half-embarrassed reactions by a gaggle of justifiably jaded nineties teenagers who see straight through his excruciating attempt to pass as cool. Poor Billy. At the world premiere of Pixels in New York Adam Sandler Kevin James and Josh Gad talk about the video games-inspired comedy caper. (July 20) AP Video Video Video How Adam Sandlers Pixels took over Times Square The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way Imagine the same scene playing out in 2015. Billy rolls up to Knibb High. Same car. Same dorky band shirt. Same crappy song. Except this time the Trans Am is seen as a cherry-condition classic. Billys peers regard the perfectly faded Speedwagon tee - which would likely fetch in excess of 100 (U.S.) on eBay - as an ironic accoutrement an attempt to reclaim the music of mom and dad. Everyone would be nodding in approval singing along as Billy Squier chants ""Stroke Stroke"" The hopeless class clown would become the prom king - or at least the cool guy in antique aviators hanging out in the smoke pit.This is for all intents and purposes the world of Sandlers latest film Pixels. It is also despairingly our world. It was one in which the garbage of the past that clutters up our minds and memories is bathed in the glimmering redemptive light of nostalgia. Its a world in which extraterrestrials attack Earth taking the form of 1980s videogame baddies and Sandler and a gaggle of other hopeless nerds adept at old arcade titles are called up to save the day avert the apocalypse get the girl etc. etc. etc. ""Looks like all the time we wasted as kids playing videogames is finally paying off"" beams Kevin James a.k.a. Paul Blart Mall Cop who plays the President of the United States of America which in its way says everything about this film the culture of vaunted boobery it emerges from and the same culture that it feeds right back into.In its own awful way Pixels feels like the culmination of the whole nerds vengeance narrative in pop culture. In 2007 director Seth Gordon crafted a quietly compelling documentary The King of Kong about two men vying for the world championship title in the arcade game Donkey Kong. The year 2011 saw the publication of Ernest Clines Ready Player One a novel in which characters enter a virtual world and are rewarded for their knowledge of late 20th-century pop culture while simultaneously patting the reader on the back for possessing that same knowledge. In 2012 the kiddie film Wreck-It Ralph tapped into videogame nostalgia dressing up a boringly rote ""be yourself"" movie with licensed arcade characters.Pixels repackages this same sycophantic nostalgia-baiting geekery. It is the ultimate fantasy of ""eighties kid"" fatuousness. It offers a scenario whereby one day all your useless non-skills may somehow avail themselves as not only useful but Earth-savingly valuable.Beyond the gamer geek stuff everything in Pixels is mapped to appeal to people who can valiantly recognize things they may have been familiar with as kids. The soundtrack is loaded with period hits Queen Tears for Fears Surrender by Cheap Trick (a song which is itself nostalgic for the previous era of radio rock n roll).At one point Sandler attempts to woo his love interest (Michelle Monaghan playing a character as far out of Sandlers league as Veronica Vaughn way back in Billy Madison) by promising her that all geeks are good kissers. This of course is a line borrowed from 1984s Revenge of the Nerds. Robert Carradines character says it after he rapes a co-ed in an inflatable bouncy house.Pixels is a movie without wit without jokes with nothing to say but plenty to regurgitate. Anyone who feels sincerely interested in being flattered by Pixels who takes comfort in the adulation of a mainstream movie telling them they are good and cool and noble for being able to recognize Qbert and Frogger would do best to save their 15 stay in draw the blinds sink into the self-gratifying strains of Billy Squier and stroke stroke.

"Review Pixels never comes into focus as a real picture - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Pixels never comes into focus as a real picture Review Pixels never comes into focus Sony Pictures A Pac-Man chomping its way through New York is among the outer-space video-game invaders in ""Pixels."" A Pac-Man chomping its way through New York is among the outer-space video-game invaders in ""Pixels."" (Sony Pictures) Mark OlsenContact Reporter Some movies are so interminable that it seems they might never end while others are assembled with such indifference that you are essentially left waiting for them to start. ""Pixels"" somehow manages both.Ostensibly a hybrid of an Adam Sandler lovable schlub vehicle with a kids picture nostalgia piece ""Pixels"" imagines that an alien invasion takes place in the form of vintage video game characters attacking major metropolises around the world. The movie tries to explain this in a semi-plausible way via recordings of 1980s video-game competitions sent into space in NASA time capsules -- just play along -- yet the most suspension-of-disbelief straining idea in the movie actually is Kevin James portraying a sitting U.S. president. INDIE FOCUS Sign up for Mark Olsens newsletter about filmThe film plays something like a knock-off ""The Goonies"" for the arrested-development set. Sandler plays a competitive teenage arcade gamer in the 80s turned present-day grown-up tech installer. His childhood best friend (James) is now the president and when the alien invasion breaks out the two realize that it will be vintage gamers who can save the day. So they draft two former fellow competitors (Peter Dinklage Josh Gad) to join a team overseen by Lt. Col. Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) to face off against their enemy in a series of challenges. Directed by Chris Columbus -- writer of ""The Goonies"" and ""Gremlins"" and director of ""Home Alone"" and the first two ""Harry Potter"" pictures -- the film takes its spectacular premise and then treats it flatly with no sense of wonder. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link Who knows what Hollywood foul Columbus committed to be tasked with overseeing junk like this? This is not the sort of thing that lands a filmmaker in the mythical purgatory of ""director jail"" -- this is director jail.Written by Timothy Dowling and Sandler regular Tim Herlihy the film is based on a 2010 short by French filmmaker Patrick Jean. Unofficially the film also borrows some of its character dynamics from Seth Gordons 2007 documentary ""The King of Kong A Fistful of Quarters"" about what became of arcade game champions later in life.""Pixels"" is all the more frustrating for the few stray interesting ideas that are left hanging because they would require thinking and work to draw them out. Exactly how a stock Kevin James character became president isnt really explained and the movie does amusingly treat it kind of just like any other job. See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link The films best sequence is one in which the video game ""Centipede"" plays out across the sky over Londons Hyde Park a psychedelic-tinged bit of weirdness that has an energy totally lacking elsewhere. (Maybe its the games mushrooms.) The ""Pac-Man"" sequence that follows shortly afterward in which small cars race through New York City streets feels like a low point shoehorning in a chase and overlong.It is rarely a good idea to think too closely on the logistics of something like ""Pixels"" but how is it that the team of nerdy middle-aged video game players are also all expert drivers of real cars in real life? Or after the required jokes that Sandler is out-of-shape how does he have the physical strength and endurance to climb up the steel girder structure that makes for the ""Donkey Kong"" finale?No one working on ""Pixels"" seems particularly interested in the movie. Near the end of the story there is mention of a treaty negotiation with the invading aliens that might have made for you know a good scene. Two female characters -- the mother of Josh Gads character and the wife of Brian Coxs warmonger admiral -- are just disembodied voices nagging from somewhere offscreen. Serena Williams and Martha Stewart make brief cameos as themselves looking awkward and vaguely embarrassed.The film stood to be some kind of summation of the long-standing 80s fixation in Sandler movies from ""The Wedding Singer"" to ""Thats My Boy"" but no one involved was engaged enough to make that so. Rather it takes a solid idea with built-in charm and squanders it. These ""Pixels"" never snap into focus remaining blurry and diffuse scattered parts that never come together in a coherent whole.mark.olsenlatimes.comTwitter IndieFocusMORE MOVIE REVIEWSSouthpaw has solid Jake Gyllenhaal in ring but a contrived scriptTrainwrecks Amy Schumer is raunchy funny and heartfeltMarvel comes up big with playful Ant-Man Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Reviews Movies Adam Sandler The Goonies (movie) Josh Gad Peter Dinklage Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-pixels-review-20150724-story.html#navtype=outfit,200,pixels8,pixels,latimes

Its easy to picture the scene. ""Remember when we were kids and our parents told us that you cant make a living playing video games? What if you could?

Credit Sony Pictures Releasing Poor Washington is having a bad summer. The city was destroyed on television Wednesday night in Syfys ""Sharknado 3 Oh Hell No"" and it takes a beating again in theaters with Fridays release of ""Pixels"" in which it is attacked by giant versions of 1980s video-game characters. Expect some of those many presidential candidates to begin dropping out of the race this weekend.""Pixels"" is a special-effects eyeful burdened by the fact that it is also yet another film in which Adam Sandler plays a man-child who somehow turns the head of an attractive woman. In this one his character Brenner was an arcade superstar as a child but grew up to be a schlump. His old skills prove useful when extraterrestrials who misunderstood a message sent into space during Ronald Reagans administration attack Earth with giant Pac-Men Centipedes and such.Josh Gad Kevin James and -- if you cant get a ""Game of Thrones"" actor these days dont bother making your movie -- Peter Dinklage play his comrades in arms. Michelle Monaghan is a lieutenant colonel who besides helping to fend off the attack has to gradually find Brenner appealing.The special effects are pretty cool but the film is working nostalgia already thoroughly mined in movies (including the video-game-themed ""Wreck-It Ralph"") and television (""The Goldbergs"" and such). So its not as original as it wants to be despite having the able Chris Columbus in the directors chair. When the story shifts to New York for the climactic battle the unlikely saviors might call to mind the ""Ghostbusters"" gang -- another 1980s reference -- and make you wish the film had the wry freshness the original installment of that franchise did.""Pixels"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) though it neednt have been; its harmless.

Comments (1) Pixels Rated PG-13  106 minutes  2015 Adam Sandler stars as a onetime arcade champion who puts his talents to good use when extraterrestrials attack the earth with giant versions of 80s video game characters. This amiable Ghostbusters knockoff is unusually competent for a Sandler comedy; director Chris Columbus (Home Alone the first two Harry Potter films) actually devotes some care to such niceties as pacing and characterization--things that Dennis Dugan Sandlers regular director seldom bothers with--and he strikes an even balance between situational humor and special effects set pieces. As for the humor its the typical Sandler shtick about arrested development and public humiliation; the big joke here is that the old-school gamers recruited to save the world have little aptitude for anything other than video games. With Kevin James as a nitwit American president modeled on George W. Bush and Michelle Monaghan as Sandlers arbitrary love interest.

Pixels review No quarter for Adam Sandler | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPixels review No quarter for Adam SandlerWith this latest movie eruption Pixels Adam Sandler wastes a good idea about space aliens using 1980s video game characters to invade Earth.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. July 23 2015PixelsStarring Adam Sandler Kevin James Josh Gad Peter Dinklage and Michelle Monaghan. Directed by Chris Columbus. 106 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. PGTorontonians have a special reason to be peeved at Pixels the latest eruption from Adam Sandlers gas factory.This sci-fi comedy of invading outer-space arcade gamers was filmed last summer on our major downtown streets adding to already considerable traffic jams. They closed Adelaide St. for this?Article Continued BelowBut everybody can get steamed about what a waste of a good idea the movie is despite the directorial efforts of Chris Columbus who did the first two Harry Potter movies.Pixels writers Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling adapt their screenplay from a brilliant French short film of the same title and theme which exhibits more creativity in two brisk minutes than Sandler and his team do in nearly two droning hours. The feature-length Pixels also steals mightily from Ghostbusters. Sandler teams with a hyperactive Josh Gad and a pixel-chewing Peter Dinklage as middle-aged versions of geeks who in the early 1980s excelled at playing video games like Pac-Man Donkey Kong and Space Invaders. None of these guys have done much with their lives since then. But when an alien race misinterprets their old-school amusements as a real-time intergalactic threat and starts attacking Earth with monstrous versions of these pixellated pals then who you gonna call?Kevin James plays the U.S. president doing the calling. He just so happens to be the childhood buddy of Sandlers Sam Brenner. Hes also illiterate for no particular reason other than a lame attempt at political humour.Such dull contrivances pile up like Tetris tiles in Pixels which also adds Michelle Monaghan as the token female invader battler and obligatory Sandler love interest. The film really bogs down midway when the action abruptly stops so Sandler and Monaghan can get their own game going.The special effects are good -- a car chase with a giant-sized Pac-Man is well done -- and Torontonians will have fun playing Spot the Landmark even though our city is once again subbing for New York.You can see Queens Park at the end of a barely disguised University Ave. during a scene where digital beasties run amok.But while the concept is a cut above the usual Sandler swill the comedy isnt. The script might as well have been penned by the same clueless aliens doing the invading. Sandler seems so listless and disconnected hes like E.T. another 1980s character. You know the stranded and lonely extraterrestrial who just wanted to phone home.Josh Gad on the run from a Pac-Man turned bad in the high-concept low-comedy Pixels.

Theres a minimum of sexist ""check out the hot fox"" hubba-hubba and zero Rob Schneider. Whats not to enjoy?  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune July 23 2015 -- 711pm Sony Pictures Ludlow (Josh Gad) is chased by a giant ball of pixels. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Adam Sandlers output has been so terrible for so long that the opening logo of his Happy Madison productions became the anti-Miramax. Viewing it before his movies promised that what youre about to see will be third-rate idiocy. How surprising that his latest ""Pixels"" is good-natured laugh-out-loud fun. Under the firm control of veteran director Chris Columbus who gave us ""Home Alone"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and the first two Harry Potter films things are so much better. ""Pixels"" was inspired by an eye-popping short of the same title that portrayed New York being invaded by classic 8-bit arcade characters from outer space. The new sci-fi action adventure comedy plays as if it wasnt designed for Sandlers fan base by his drinking buddies. The stars usual cloud of floating anger is reduced to a mere hint. Laughs are triggered not by gross-out buttons but clever writing and slick performances. Theres a minimum of sexist ""check out the hot fox"" hubba-hubba and zero Rob Schneider. Whats not to enjoy? The film opens in 1982 a date pretty close to the appearance of ""Ghostbusters"" which clearly influenced this re-imagining. We meet our main characters as youthful video game arcade pals. Played at the opening by young look-alike dramatis personae Sandler is an upcoming champion gamer Kevin James his nebbish sidekick Josh Gad a smart socially incompetent dweeb and Peter Dinklage their snarly nemesis a brash rival for the gamers world championship. A video of their digital Donkey Kong competition is launched in a NASA rocket by none other than Dan Aykroyd (those ""Ghostbusters"" references pop up all over). Zoom ahead to the current era of Nintendo Xbox and Wii. The weaponized shooting skills of Halos space soldiers have long replaced the speedy strategic approach that earned top scores in Galaga and Space Invaders. Sandler is now a second-rate electronics installer whose playtime skills could save the planet following an attack by aliens who assumed the 1982 space probes old arcade game recording was a declaration of war against them. Sony Pictures Inky Binky Clyde and Pinky in ""Pixels."" As the extraterrestrials send giant versions of Pac-Man and his friends Sandler is placed at the head of U.S. defense by the president. The chief executive is played by James whose worrisome much-mocked character is deliberately presented as the plots least credible twist. Sandler reunites his old crew to join the fight handling his role more as the likable straight man than the comedy standout. Dinklage sporting an absurdist mullet and delivering a totally cuckoo performance as the cocky little so-and-so instantly wins that race. A wonderful chemistry unites the guys as Sandler avoids the usual malcontent edge of his earlier movies. This is a film about goofs drawn together by teamwork and it works. Theres even a dozen good jokes for the female supporting character a weapons expert played by Michelle Monaghan fresh off last summers impressive dramatic turn in HBOs ""True Detective."" The battle scenes are joyfully goofy with familiar 8-bit figures from the past chewing fire trucks apart and throwing endless supplies of barrels at Earthlings. Theres a spirit of carefree nihilism in their pixelated destruction and since their troops are play-pretend creatures blasting them doesnt carry the slightest smidge of real revenge. ""Pixels"" is one of the highlights of the summer a teenage dream for all ages. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Updated July 30 2016  353 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Video-game comedy Pixels does not compute By Joe Williams St. Louis Post-Dispatch Joe Williams Jul 23 2015 (...) Every time theres a new Adam Sandler release I am legally required to print this disclaimer ""The Wedding Singer"" was a good movie. The first two-thirds of ""Funny People"" was a very good movie. And ""Punch-Drunk Love"" was a great movie. So I try to approach every Sandler movie with an open mind.But God knows my open mind has gotten a lot of garbage poured into it. Could hell itself be worse than ""Little Nicky""? Is there a big enough pail of water to drown the memory of ""Jack and Jill?"" Wasnt an entire generation stunted by ""Grown-Ups""?A few years ago a friend of mine actually dropped dead while watching Sandlers ""Bedtime Stories."" And that was supposed to be a warm and fuzzy one Sandler is back in family mode for ""Pixels."" An open mind will note that it was directed by someone from outside of Sandlers playpen Chris Columbus whose resume includes ""Home Alone"" ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" and the first two ""Harry Potter"" movies. But nope theres no comedy magic here. ""Pixels"" is a movie for a very particular audience -- the 12-year-old version of Sandler and his infantile posse.In 1982 a new video arcade opens in suburban Sandlerville. Video-game champion Sam and his friend Will excitedly grab their bicycles -- and a jar full of quarters from a little girls lemonade stand. More than 30 years later Sam is a lowly installer for an electronics store while idiotic Will (Kevin James) is the president of the United States. Of course.Yet theyve remained hang-out buddies. Now the president needs Sams expertise. Aliens have discovered time-capsule footage of 1980s American culture and are challenging the people of Earth to a do-or-die competition with classic arcade games on a galactic scale. Puzzlingly this is an alien-invasion movie where we never see the aliens. They communicate with the Earthlings via video messages modeled after the footage in the time capsule. Thus they take the guise of Ricardo Montalban Daryl Hall and Max Headroom. (Sadly the ""Wheres the beef?"" lady seems to have been left on the cutting-room floor along with any actual jokes.)Sam doesnt seem especially concerned about the fate of the Earth but working on the project allows him to get cozy with defense analyst and sexy single mom Violet (Michelle Monaghan). It also lets him reunite with some rival gamers from yesteryear including arrogant hotshot Eddie (Peter Dinklage who steals the movie) and fawning nerd Ludlow (Josh Gad). ""Pixels"" is not in the same universe as the animated ""Wreck-It Ralph"" a loving tribute to the history of video games. Here the early-generation games being played in the skies above London and New York are blocky and bland. Theres little sense of danger as the humans fire laser cannons while dodging badly rendered asteroids and rolling barrels.Long before youve gotten a nickels worth of entertainment out of this dumb unfunny flick youll be wishing for the flashing sign that says ""Game over.""What ""Pixels""  11/2 stars out of four  Run time 145  Rating PG-13  Content Some mature language and suggestive comments Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Adam Sandler Pixels Josh Gad Peter Dinklage Joe Williams Chris Columbus Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Aliens attack Earth using 1980s arcade games as inspiration. Comedy-action film starts with a nice mix of whimsy and nostalgia but it runs too long and feels like it was edited with garden shears.Fun references can only take a movie like ""Pixels"" so far.(Photo Sony Pictures Releasing)Story HighlightsPixelss choppy pace diminishes what little fun it has.The film boasts visual flair and little else.2 1/2 stars out of 5.""Pixels"" boasts a high-concept plot that aims to appeal to youngsters and nostalgic Gen-X parents. Aliens attack the Earth using 1980s arcade games as their inspiration. Giant Tetris blocks crash down on the street while a huge Pac-Man eats everything in its path.Sounds fun? Well it is for a bit. However it manages to achieve the weird feat of feeling overlong and choppy at the same time like someone edited the film with a pair of garden shears.The movie opens in 1982 and follows three youngsters who love video games. The initial mix of sentiment and whimsy is nice with the kids tossing about references to Sheena Easton and Samantha Fox (Anachronism alert The latter didnt get famous until 1986.) Director Chris Columbus knows this kind of territory having made the fun ""Adventures in Babysitting"" in 1987 and two Harry Potter movies more recently.Itd be nice if Sandler actually tried to be someone other than himself. (Photo Sony Pictures Releasing)Things then jump to modern times and we meet the adult versions of the kids. Sam (Adam Sandler) has a Geek Squad-style job Ludlow (Josh Gad) lives at home with his grandmother and Will (Kevin James) is the president of the United States. James makes an unlikely POTUS but its in keeping with the general nature of things. Sandler in particular doesnt even try to create a character he just recites his lines and coasts by on his sheer Sandler-ness.Throw in an abrasive arcade champ (Peter Dinklage from ""Game of Thrones"") and Sams flirtation with a lieutenant colonel (Michelle Monaghan who outclasses the material) and you have enough subplots rolling around to keep the young ones diverted in between the alien attacks. Still the pacing never feels quite right and characters come and go with little logic. Jane Krakowski plays the first lady though it takes a scene or two to figure out who she is.AZCENTRALPixels (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe visual effects are impressive and there is a certain kick to seeing the human characters dodging barrels in a life-size Donkey Kong.

Photo Sony Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Pixels Running time 106 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity suggestive humor). ""Pixels"" started off lazily enough with nothing more on its mind than ripping off ""Ghostbusters"" with video game characters. But it stumbled onto an accomplishment truly awe-inspiring It makes ""Battleship"" and ""The Watch"" look good. Kevin James (from left) Michelle Monaghan Adam Sandler Josh Gad and Peter DinklagePhoto Sony Pictures Hiding Adam Sandlers participation on the poster of the film is understandable but the studio should have taken the logical next step and made the entire film disappear or at least have shot it off into space like the clips of 1982 pop-culture highlights which in ""Pixels"" are seen by aliens. They mistake images from classic arcade games as a military threat and respond by disguising themselves as Centipede and Pac-Man and attack the Earth. Its sporting of them to offer us a best three-out-of five contest for galactic domination so that any record of the struggle would look a lot like a formula blockbuster with different wacky villains for each battle. Sandler whose team produced the film plays an underachieving former teen video game champ whose equally dim best friend played by Kevin James grows up to be the president. Of a bowling league? No of the United States. Between Kevin James and a meatball parmigiana for president Id say the sandwich is more plausible. And based on the actions of James President Cooper the sandwich would make wiser decisions. The Prez is goofing around dumping sprinkles on a cake in the midst of alien attacks on Guam and the Taj Mahal. Couldnt they make him or the movie dumb in an interesting way? Adam SandlerPhoto Sony Pictures Though Sandlers character Brenner grows up to be a loser who installs TVs for a living hes the first one the President calls when the space invaders arrive. A customer (Michelle Monaghan) Brenner was trying to flirt with turns out to be the presidents colonel in charge of superduper secret weapons and Brenners other boyhood gamer pal Ludlow (Josh Gad) joins the alien-repelling force along with Brenners archrival Eddie (Peter Dinklage). Dinklage for reasons best known to him seems to be trying to sound like a black guy but then again this is the kind of anything-goes affair where a mad four-star officer (Brian Cox) appears to belong to a different branch of the military every time we see him -- and the genius scientist instantly figures out how to defeat the aliens with what look like Super Soakers wrapped in tinfoil on the way to the set. Do you sense that the movie is as adolescent as a zit? And yet I havent even told you about the hubba-hubba see-the-pretty-lady slavering of the boys the soundtracks cement-head rock (Loverboy ""We Will Rock You"") and dire one-liners like ""Have you been playing Space Invaders? Youre invading my space"" or ""Its totally tubular"" Mainly the movie is a thin excuse to digitally wreck buildings as video game characters crumble into pixels. These bits look like little plastic cubes colored by glow sticks -- and yet theyre the main special effect. You get the feeling the boys spent the nine-figure budget on trips to Hooters. Sandler has found it vastly profitable to remain a mental middle-schooler into middle age but crucially hes stuck in a 1982 kid time capsule His jokes are as fresh as the antique store. This movie isnt for todays teens its for dudes born in the 1960s who never let go of their joysticks.

Close Join the conversation... On Facebook On Twitter With Britton Peele Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Nostalgia is a powerful thing. Show a classic video game fan a cool live-action recreation of Centipede or play them some sound effects from Galaga and you can elicit happy memories and feelings of joy.But nostalgia can only get you so far and if you were to take the well-known arcade icons out of Pixels and replace them with generic characters you would be left with a bland illogical mess of a sci-fi movie. The experience is an exercise in cringing at bad one-liners and stomaching dumb plot devices before saying ""Aww look Q-Bert"" In 1982 Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler) narrowly loses a video game championship that is filmed and sent into space by NASA. Years later aliens have found that footage and taken it as a challenge to come to Earth and battle for supremacy in gigantic recreations of 80s-era arcade games.Brenners childhood friend Will Cooper (Kevin James) is somehow the President of the United States despite displaying little to no aptitude for the job during the course of the movie. Of course he calls in Brenner and a couple other acquaintances from their past (Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage) because the U.S. military is no match for the likes of Donkey Kong or Breakout the world needs gamers.Its a familiar fantasy for those who have spent a long time (perhaps too long) playing games. The idea that maybe just maybe having the highest score in Joust will one day get you a job an attractive spouse and the adoration of the world at large is intoxicating. Winning a major tournament or ending up in the Guinness Book of World Records would be cool enough but saving the world? Thats got to feel great right? This photo provided by courtesy of Sony Pictures shows Michelle Monaghan from left as Violet Adam Sandler as Sam Brenner Josh Gad as Ludlow and Qbert in Columbia Pictures ""Pixels."" The movie opens in U.S. theaters on July 24 2015. Courtesy Sony Pictures/AP When it works Pixels feels like an attempt to write a love letter to old-school gamers and the games they loved but even when the geeks of the movie are heroes they tend to be ripe for ridicule. In these moments the movie doesnt feel like a heartfelt tribute it feels like a shameful attempt to cash in on the people who do fondly remember arcades.The main protagonist is not great with women and he pulls off flirtatious moves with a just-divorced Lieutenant Colonel (Michelle Monaghan) that shouldnt work yet somehow do. Gads character is a conspiracy nut whose social awkwardness puts the 40 Year Old Virgin to shame. Though hes supposedly based loosely on real-world video game champion Billy Mitchell Dinklages character is the kind of over-the-top jerk that nobody would ever want to hang out with in any capacity.Oh and Gads love interest (Ashley Benson)? Shes a fictional video game heroine with zero lines of dialogue who exists only to look beautiful. Its no secret that video games in general have not had the greatest track record with female characters but do we have to spread that failure to video game movies as well? This photo provided by courtesy of Sony Pictures shows Peter Dinklage from left as Eddie Ashley Benson as Lady Lisa and Josh Gad as Ludlow on the streets of Washington D.C. in Columbia Pictures ""Pixels."" The movie opens in U.S. theaters on July 24 2015. George Kraychyk/AP If you want to enjoy Pixels dont try to pay attention to its story. One major plot point involves one of the main characters somehow using a cheat code in a real-world version of Pac-Man causing the invading aliens to declare all-out war because the humans ""broke the rules."" Just one problem with that (well OK one of many problems with that) the aliens themselves already broke the rules of the games theyre claiming to imitate. You know Centipede? Yeah the titular monster in that game shouldnt be able to just leave the field of play to wreak havoc on some nearby apartment buildings.To be fair the mess of a plot is mostly there to loosely tie together the big CG set pieces which can be legitimately entertaining. The aforementioned Centipede scene is a fun ride that at its best manages to accurately capture the old coin-op feeling of shooting frantically at bugs as they get closer and closer to the ground. Isolate a few scenes like this and you could have a series of mini films that rival the 2010 original Pixels short which this movie attempts to stretch to a worthwhile feature length. Classic video games come to life in ""Pixels."" (Photo courtesy Sony Pictures/TNS) Handout/TNS But even the nostalgia play goes too far and Pixels leans so heavily on it that the whole thing collapses. There is a reference to the notorious message board 4chan that exists for no reason other than to be a reference. At one point in the movie fictional British AI Max Headroom makes an appearance despite being only tangentially (at best) related to video games. Time after time Pixels trots out something from the 80s as a crutch to cover up a lack of clever writing.Pixels is disappointing largely because of what it could have been. Other movies (like the documentary King of Kong) have proven that competitive video games can be exciting while other mediums (like the novel Ready Player One) have proven that you can have a better narrative excuse for revisiting arcade classics. It has some fun moments but Pixels probably isnt destined for its own place on the movie high score board. PIXELS (C-)Directed by Chris Columbus.

(SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT) ""Pixels"" is the cinematic equivalent of a Buzzfeed listicle entitled ""50 Things Only 80s Kids Can Understand."" ""Remember Pac-Man?"" the movie asks us. ""Wasnt it awesome?"" It was. But a movie has to be something more than a parade of nostalgia-inducing images. There has to be some excuse for clips of first-generation Madonna and Max Headroom all slicked-back hair and stuttering syllables. In ""Pixels"" that something more turns out to be an Adam Sandler movie. Its one weve seen before An immature deadbeat woos a lovely otherwise intelligent lady. Few things strike greater fear in the heart of a moviegoer than the logo of Happy Madison Sandlers production company that unleashed such dogs as ""Blended"" ""Here Comes the Boom"" and ""Joe Dirt 2 Beautiful Loser."" The action comedy ""Pixels"" fares slightly better thanks to the clever premise of a 2010 short by Patrick Jean which inspired this film. When intergalactic aliens misunderstand a video feed of classic arcade games as a declaration of war they attack Earth in the form of video game characters. A group of old-school arcade players are the only hope for the planets survival. (  / Sony Pictures) In that short New York is attacked by characters from classic video games. Frogger takes out taxis; Tetris pieces destroy buildings one floor at a time. Set in the near future Sandlers feature-length version adds a bit of back story In the 1980s the United States tries to make contact with alien civilizations by launching a time capsule into space including the eras most popular arcade games. But when those extraterrestrials intercept the message they mistake the playful payload for a declaration of war responding with their own hostile version of Donkey Kong and Lady Lisa. The only way to beat them is to win a large-scale version of Centipede Galaga or any of the other retro games that the enemy wants to play. Dont bother thinking too deeply about this. Sandler plays Sam Brenner the 1982 Pac-Man world champion who hasnt amounted to much since then spending his days installing electronics. His best friend from childhood Will Cooper (frequent Sandler collaborator Kevin James) is the borderline illiterate president of the United States making Sam well-positioned for heroism once the alien invasion begins. No one knows 1980s video games like Sam and his other longtime friend Ludlow a creepy conspiracy theorist played by Josh Gad. Navy SEALs are powerless so nerds have to save the day. The world may be at stake but the movie is more concerned with whether Sam will get the girl an army colonel played by Michelle Monaghan. Having been recently ditched by her husband (for a 19-year-old named Sinnamon) shes unreasonably susceptible to Sams ""charms"" even though shes his better in every way looks smarts maturity fight moves. The action sequences are the most enjoyable part of the movie. Director Chris Columbus is no slouch when it comes to big-screen adventure having directed ""Home Alone"" and the first two ""Harry Potter"" installments (not to mention having written both ""The Goonies"" and ""Young Sherlock Holmes""). In one standout scene Pac-Man attacks New York while four ghosts -- in this case four Mini Coopers -- chase him up and down city streets. Product placement has rarely been so much fun. The comedy is less effective. Sandler doesnt appear to be trying terribly hard and Gad gets sucked into that humor vacuum going after laughs with a palpable desperation and adopting Sandlers signature move of yelling for no apparent reason. Meanwhile the normally funny Jane Krakowski is utterly wasted as an irrationally jealous first lady relegated to a scene in which her husband is afraid to admit that another woman is pretty. The women-are-bonkers bit is as fresh as a Borsht Belt joke circa 1960. Golden Globe winner Peter Dinklage sporting a mullet fares no better with the humor of his one-dimensional character relying on his egotism and attempts to have a threesome with Serena Williams and Martha Stewart. Lazy humor and familiar plotting aside ""Pixels"" at least gets a little mileage out of its affection for the 1980s. But why bother spending time or money on a movie when you can indulge that nostalgia on your Facebook news feed? PG-13. At area theaters.

"Pixels (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Pixels (PG-13) Supporting cast cool effects make Pixels worth your quarters. Share Print Save to your profile By Katie Walsh | Tribune News Service7/22/2015 Editor rating 2.5 ""Let the nerds take over."" This is an official order handed down by President Cooper (Kevin James) during an alien invasion where earth is being attacked by extraterrestrial life in the form of 1980s arcade games. In Pixels directed by Chris Columbus the 40-something self-described losers who spent too much time at the arcade are the ones who will inherit the earth -- led by their benevolent leader Adam Sandler of course. Sandler plays Sam Brennan a video game whiz kid we meet in a 1982 prologue with his best friend Chewy the one who inexplicably grows up to lead the free world -- somehow the giant Pac-Man chomping through New York City requires less suspension of disbelief. Sam his confidence destroyed after losing to Eddie ""Fireblaster"" in the ""Donkey Kong"" world championships hasnt gone as far as his pal. Hes ended up as a self-deprecating aw-shucks but defensive employee of the Nerd Brigade installing Playstations. When a mysterious alien invasion that looks eerily similar to ""Galaga"" hits a military base President Cooper has no choice but to call in his big guns Sam and their conspiracy theorist wing-nut childhood pal Ludlow (Josh Gad). The two are to use their finely honed expertise to train the Navy SEALs but it turns out you cant send special ops to do a nerds job. The only ones who can combat this invasion are the Arcaders -- Sam Ludlow and former nemesis Firecracker (Peter Dinklage) sprung from the clink for the occasion. Pixels is a blast of energetic fun though it doesnt attempt to stray outside the lines or reflect on its Godzilla-style formula; the novelty of nostalgic video game characters as space invaders sustains the film thanks to the spectacularly executed and original effects. While Dinklage shows his comic side with a wild mullet and bizarre accent Gad is the real standout giving an effervescently full-bodied performance as the paranoid passionate Ludlow. Sandler is barely putting in effort and Sam could have been played by anyone. At this point Sandler seems to put in appearances only to get movies financed. One has to wonder who this movie is truly for. With a broadly humorous PG-13 tone it feels like a kids film but niche references to 80s ephemera like Fantasy Island and Max Headroom will only hit with the Gen-Xers in the audience. Theres quite a bit of ""back in my day"" grumbling arguing that arcade games are inherently better than todays video games a message that feels stuffy and backward. It also must be mentioned that the female characters truly get short shrift. Theres only one named female character who actually gets to speak (unless you count ""First Lady"" as a name or ""Serena Williams"" as a character). Poor Ashley Benson plays a literal ""trophy"" who doesnt have a single line while Michelle Monaghan is forced into a sexy scientist stereotype far below her talents. However expecting more than that from an Adam Sandler joint is futile. Despite these unfortunate shortcomings Pixels has its funny and fresh moments thanks in large part to the supporting comic actors and inventive special effects.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Pixels rests on a terrible implausibility. Not the idea that aliens might intercept broadcasts of early 80s arcade games and misinterpret them as an act of war sending large-scale versions of those games to attack Earth in retaliation. That requires minimal summer-movie buy-in (though even the anything-goes Futurama in its concisely hilarious version of this story told it as a non-canon what-if episode--and eight years before the short that serves as basis for this feature). No behind Pixels high-concept silliness lurks a conceit that further challenges rational thought the idea that in this movie Adam Sandlers character self-identifies as a nerd.Sandler is probably capable of playing a nerd. Hes not a bad actor and many of his earliest routines turn on a malcontented outsider status that isnt so far removed from nerdiness though that status often metastasizes into bullying aggression instead. But Sam Brenner the guy Sandler plays in Pixels acquires his imagined nerd status purely on paper He is very very good at video games specifically arcade versions of games like Pac-Man and Centipede which he has beaten by learning their patterns. After losing an arcade competition as a teenager he failed to attend MIT as planned--or rather failed to attend the MIT of plans instead matriculating at the ""Mississippi Institute Of Technology"" a pretty good joke that the movie muffles in the delivery--and winds up working as a disappointed technology installation guru. Meanwhile his childhood buddy Cooper (Kevin James) has improbably become president of the United States. They still get together for beers and burgers so Cooper can tell Brenner that he was ""meant for something more.""Through this point Brenners personality hasnt really registered as nerdy despite his arcade prowess; hes just another middle-aged Sandler Guy wearing shorts and delivering low-energy quips. But when he goes on an installation call and sort of connects with Violet (Michelle Monaghan) he tries to rouse those low-energy quips into quasi-romantic banter. Director Chris Columbus handles the scene with such typically leaden pause-heavy reverence to the material (or in this case the lack of material) that Sandler not nimble enough as a romantic lead to pull off the love-hate bickering (weirdly and awkwardly photocopied from Blended) appears not just out of his comfort zone but fully unaware of it.Brenners flirtatious spat with Violet is capped with an assertion that as a nerd hes a really good kisser; nerds after all are more grateful for romantic attention than confident handsome rich guys on yachts. But that pandering line doesnt seem to understand nerdiness so much as conflate it with the slobs-versus-snobs dynamic Sandler loves--and in case thats unclear Brenner then specifically calls Violet a snob. In true Sandler fashion this becomes a feeble imitation of a running joke which is to say he repeats unimaginative variations on the insult (theyre all basically ""Okay there snobby"") ad infinitum. Its banter reduced to a playground taunt a routine Sandler continues when Cooper asks him to consult on the video game invasion (alongside Violet who turns out to be a weapons specialist for the White House) including another molasses-paced scene where Brenner methodically and lamely insults everyone in the Situation Room. Joylessly obsessed with video games and impotently insulting anyone who disagrees with him? Maybe Brenner does fit a nerd profile after all Hes a poster man-child for angry internet trolls. Even on its own silly terms Pixels is not a very good movie; its painted up like a Ghostbusters-style fantasy-comedy but plays like so many slapdash Happy Madison productions before it. But its not the least funny Sandler movie of recent years mostly because of its non-Sandler recruits. To game the Earth to safety Brenner teams up with Ludlow (Josh Gad) an oddball conspiracy theorist and Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) who beat Brenner at Donkey Kong years ago must be sprung from prison and is clearly modeled after Billy Mitchell the villain of Seth Gordons documentary The King Of Kong. Both actors are doing zany shtick but at least theyre doing it with energy and their characters outlandishness seems to inspire screenwriters Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling to write some better jokes. (Ludlow for example believes that the Zapruder film was edited to hide the fact that ""JFK shot first."") In plenty of other movies Gads sweaty-weirdo routine feels like second-rate Jack Black; in a Happy Madison production he almost counts as inspired. Gad also does a decent job assaying a broad version of what Toby from American Splendor would call a ""genuine nerd."" Sandler for his part just steps back and looks tired in a checked-out performance that invites idle thoughts about whether his fondness for product placement has expanded to include Dan Aykroyds Crystal Head Vodka. (Signs point to yes Both Aykroyd and a vodka-filled skull make brief separate appearances.) Sandler barely interacts with any of his co-stars--including the special effects which are brightly colored but rarely exciting awe-inspiring or even particularly funny. A giant Pac-Man comes the closest but the film never seizes on animation as an opportunity for nerdy visual jokes in the style of Futurama or Wreck-It Ralph. Rather it wants credit just for showing up in the style of 2015 Adam Sandler.

A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Heres a shocker In Pixels his latest Adam Sandler plays a stunted man-child who turns out to be very very special. Thats his ecological niche the Manic Potbellied Dream Dork or if you prefer the fragile Sand-Man. Sandler films have predictable scripts In two hours or less hell transform from loser to hero often tacking on an improbable girlfriend and often without transforming at all. (An Oscar for the first costume designer who gets him to wear a shirt that fits.) Instead its everyone else in the cast who must about-face and appreciate him. And if we dont admire him fast enough hell call us snobs.Sandler didnt invent snobs-versus-slobs comedy. He didnt even perfect it. But he has conquered the genre by refusing to age out of it. He gets older but his inner dork stays the same age. Pixels directed by King of the Kiddos Chris Columbus (Home Alone Adventures in Babysitting) freezes Sandler as preteen video game legend Sam Brenner whose life peaked when he placed second in a Donkey Kong championship. An egomaniac named Eddie (Peter Dinklage channeling Billy Mitchell in the superior doc King of Kong) took first crushing Sams dreams with a barrel. If youve followed Sandlers insensitive misadventures on the set of his cowboys-and-Indians spoof The Ridiculous 6 the good news is Pixels doesnt make a single joke about Dinklages height. The bad news is it doesnt even acknowledge his majestic blond-streaked mullet the most outrageous head of hair since Fabio.Film Details Pixels RatingPG-13 GenreAnimation Running Time106 min. More Info Sams a failure. His polo shirt literally reads ""Nerd."" But in Sandlers world failures always win. Just look at his childhood best friend Will Cooper (Kevin James). Hes an illiterate loudmouth and he still grew up to be president. Implausible? Absolutely. But Columbus includes a familiar classroom scene of President Cooper bumbling through a childrens book to remind us that morons can succeed -- just 15 years ago real-life voters made it happen. (And God forbid might again.) Outside the school citizens vilify their commander-in-chief. Only in a Sandler film where the stars self-esteem is the highest priority would the president be less concerned about leading the country than he is fixing his best friend advising him that in todays world his arcade skills are as futile as ""being a great blacksmith.""Luckily ego and approval ratings intertwine when the planet Volula mistakenly interprets a VHS tape of Sams Donkey Kong competition shot out to space for lord only knows what reason as a declaration of war. The aliens invade Earth with weapons they believe well understand Galaga drones giant Centipedes skyscraper-gobbling Tetris blocks and angry-pickle escapees from Burger Time. (In the movies best joke they also use 80s celebs to communicate Reagan Tammy Faye and offscreen the ""Wheres the Beef?"" granny.) If Sam Eddie and buddy Ludlow (Josh Gad) cant best the Volulans two out of three the Earth is lost. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Theres a perverse humor in the backflips Pixels does to let these pinball gizzards prove their worth. Sam Eddie and Ludlow are so giddy abut sticking it to those useless muscle-bound Marines that Armageddon feels like a goof. Even they arent serious about the stakes. When Michelle Monaghans lieutenant colonel Sams love interest asks if the government should place all its trust in him Sam whines ""I dont know if I wanna do it now -- shes being kind of mean.""To Sandler this is flirting. Hes never evolved past the ""Ew Cooties"" phase of courtship but on screen that always lands him a babe. And Columbus indulges Sandlers delusions forcing Monaghan to play a role thats equal parts tough soldier lonelyheart and mommy. In one of her romantic scenes she coos to Sandler ""You brushed your teeth"" What was ""You went potty"" too erotic? Worse in Pixels women are rewards If the guys save the world their prize is a beauty -- even Eddies fantasy of a threesome with Serena Williams and Martha Stewart. Kudos I suppose to Williams and Stewart for braving a cameo.At least the space invaders look great. Zapped humans dissolve in a Picassoesque swirl of cubes the face going last so we can hear their screams. Qbert appears acting as generic as a sassy cartoon dog. (Apparently his ""?"" translates to a PG-13 approved ""Bull crap"") Theres a glint of pathos when Pac-Mans inventor (Denis Akiyama) is crushed to see his creation chomping Manhattan. ""Deep down hes kind gentle"" whimpers his Dr. Iwatani. A final battle of Donkey Kong with five levels of ladders and a furious gorilla is as scary as this movie dares get. I sucked in my breath -- that game is deadly -- and then grumbled to realize that Pixels wasnt going to bother actually following the rules.Still Sandler is following his own rules Every year hes gotta star in an expensive anti-intellectual gasbag that anoints him the Best Boy in the World. And audiences are running out of quarters. Its time to take higher-level advice from Eddie the Donkey Kong conquerer ""Playing by the patterns doesnt do the trick anymore.""PIXELS | Directed by Chris Columbus | Written by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling | Sony Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic ""Pixels"" the action/comedy in which Adam Sandler leads a team of former arcade-game champions to save the world from an invasion of 1980s video-game characters wants badly to be ""Ghostbusters."" Except it doesnt want to be ""Ghostbusters"" quite badly enough to make much of an effort and the end result is an inexpensive-looking cheerfully lazy semi-adventure. And Sandler is not Bill Murray to put it mildly. Movie Review 1/2   Pixels with Adam Sandler Kevin James Josh Gad Michelle Monaghan Peter Dinklage Brian Cox. Directed by Chris Columbus from a screenplay by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling. 106 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some language and suggestive comments. Several theaters. (Now that I think of it Both Sandler and Murray could be described as performers in similar terms -- effortless deadpan a trademark persona. Its just that Murrays apparent lack of effort -- or perhaps the amount of effort he puts into looking like he isnt trying or maybe just his naturally funny charisma -- adds up to something compelling. Sandlers regular-dude-who-happened-to-wander-onto-a-film-set shtick is less so.) Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Thats how he winds up front and center when for reasons Ill skip over 1980s video-game creatures like Pac-Man Centipede Frogger and Donkey Kong begin to attack the great capitals of the world. To fight and destroy them Brenner is joined by the president old gaming pal Ludlow (Josh Gad) old gaming nemesis Eddie (Peter Dinklage) and requisite Sole Woman In The Movie With More Than Three Lines Lt. Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) whos some sort of military scientist in tight pencil skirts. Theoretically this could have been a lot of fun particular for those with fond memories of 80s video gamery. (Hey wheres Ms. Pac-Man?) When attacked buildings -- and people -- turn into pixels and crumble away complete with goofy arcade-game sound effects. ""Pixels"" directed by Chris Columbus has a couple of laugh-worthy moments particularly a kid in India who responds to the pixelling of the Taj Mahal by (what else?) taking a selfie and a very funny cameo from a well-known sports figure. But the special effects are competent rather than dazzling and the whole enterprise quickly runs out of steam long before its end. Who you gonna call? Not these guys.

A pre-emptive alien attack causes widespread anachronistic mayhem in ""Pac-Man"" which has some good jokes. Photo Handout Washington Post Pixels -- inventive comedy at least half the way 1 / 4 Back to Gallery With a novel idea at its center and some good jokes scattered throughout ""Pixels"" is a relief from the self-serious action films that invade movie theaters at this time of year. For most of the way its good enough to enjoy and for the rest of the way its good enough to root for. But ultimately its not quite good enough ... to be good enough. Its at its best and at its most original in its first half when the movie is establishing its premise and setting its tone. Its about a war to save the planet only this time the war is based on a misunderstanding. Back in 1982 a time capsule was sent from Earth into outer space and among the cultural markers contained was footage of people playing the popular video games of the era. Apparently the aliens misinterpreted the video game footage as a threat and developed their own versions of Pac-Man etc. Now in our era theyre staging a pre-emptive attack. The movies combination of inventiveness and sloppiness is evident in its handling of the 80s era. Its very funny for example that the aliens choose to talk to earthlings using images wed understand -- and so we get computer-altered images of 1980s personalities issuing the aliens threats. But if these images were derived from a time capsule sent in 1982 why would they send back a video of Madonna talking in either 1984 or 1985? For that matter why would the aliens reference the ""Wheres the Beef?"" commercial for Wendys which didnt run until 1984? And why would American boys in 1982 be expressing their lust for Samantha Fox when she was completely unknown until 1983 and then only in Britain? These are small matters but they indicate a larger casualness which becomes a problem midway through when the story runs out of gas. Instead of finding new ways to be inventive the screenwriters rely on action-movie tropes and director Chris Columbus and the actors are left to try to make these scenes interesting. They almost do. Adam Sandler is appealing in a straight-man role in which he must react to the absurdity of others. A former champion video-game player he is now installing home entertainment systems but his seemingly useless gaming skills become crucial when the aliens attack and it just so happens that he is a childhood friend of the president. Traditionally movies have the president resemble the sitting president but ""Pixels"" takes place in a post-Obama near future with Kevin James as an overweight president from the Northeast of a similar look and vintage as Chris Christie but without the latters bluster. All the scenes involving the president and the White House are comic and effective. The president here is a beaten man cowed by his own national security team and hemmed in by low approval ratings. When he steps out in public he waves and utters pleasantries while angry crowds yell at him. But once ""Pixels"" becomes a series of alien attack scenes it loses its spark. The sight of Pac-Man gliding through the city street gobbling up everything in its path is amusing in the moment but without any real sense of threat the action cant really hold interest for an entire long sequence. Still though ""Pixels"" may be hard to respect or fully endorse its also impossible to dislike. And thats not a small thing. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Photo Sony Pictures ""Am I high right now?"" I scribbled in my notes during the second half of the new Adam Sandler gamesploitation flick Pixels. Dont get too excited The film is bad -- worse even than it looks probably -- but by that point it had achieved such throwaway weirdness that instead of staring stone-faced at how bland and unfunny it all was I found myself giggling at its sheer idiocy. Thats probably the idea to some extent as any movie where Kevin James plays the president of the United States clearly doesnt want you engaging with it on a deeper level. But its hard not to look at Pixels and feel like Sandler amp; Co. missed a huge opportunity here. While its a lot more kid-friendly and CGI-heavy than the usual Happy Madison fare Pixels is at heart another harebrained Sandlerian teenage wish-fulfillment fantasy. This time instead of scoring his hot eighth-grade teacher or getting back at jocks or fast-forwarding through the boring parts of life hes asked to save the world by playing a giant real-life 1980s video game Enders Game meets Grown Ups. So the film begins in the summer of 1982 when Sam Brenner (Anthony Ippolito in his youth Sandler in the present-day) was a dorky teenage arcade king often accompanied by chubby pal Will Cooper (Jared Riley in his youth James in the present). But when Sam loses to the preening be-mulleted and perfectly named Eddie Plant (a very good Andrew Bambridge in his youth an even better Peter Dinklage in the present) he is shattered. Years later we find our hero working a dead-end job as a TV and electronics repairman when Will now a lousy president with plunging poll numbers calls him in for help with an ominous new enemy Something is attacking the Earth and it appears to be Galaga. It turns out an alien race has misinterpreted all the video-game signals beamed into space over the decades as a challenge. So theyve reprogrammed and supersized all our old video-game characters and have come to battle humanity for the fate of planet Earth. (And because this is another 80s love-fest from Sandler the aliens menacing exhortations come via video clips of Ronald Reagan Hall amp; Oates Madonna et al.) Sam and Will are joined by Eddie now sprung from prison (in exchange for helping he wants clemency freedom from taxes and a threesome with Martha Stewart and Serena Williams) and Uber-geek conspiracy-theorist Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) to face off against these giant pixelated monsters. Helping lead them is Lt. Col. Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) a beautiful divorced single mom who first has to endure Sams pathetic advances before its revealed that shes a military official. Then she has to endure his pathetic barbs about what a snob she is because she wouldnt go out with him. I know I know -- good times. At his best Sandler plays characters who are mired in self-loathing and disassociated from the world. When the camera focuses on him especially in his earlier films something surprisingly dark emerges from behind that casual devil-may-care facade. And there is a promising idea here Sam as a kid masters video games because he can see the patterns -- everything he thinks fits into a preprogrammed routine. As an adult he adheres to the same philosophy. When Violet first rejects him (""I dont think my rebound guy is a 210-pound guy who fixes TVs for a living"") he launches into a vision of the world that fits everybody into preassigned roles Shes a snob hes a nerd etc. If you squint really hard you might discern a theme there. Sam cant progress in the game of life because he sees everything as predetermined. ""The only way to beat these things is to calculate the numbers"" he tells Violets young son as they bond over video games. But the boy raised on first-person shooters in a post-Atari world has a different existential philosophy ""Pretend youre the guy and you dont want to die."" Jean-Paul Sartre eat your heart out. Alas Sandler plays it all so awkwardly that any meaning is lost amid a queasy sea of awkward pauses and halfhearted line-delivery. I say this as a fan He seems tired. Not merely lazy lets-just-cash-the-check tired. Its a drained get-me-out-of-here tired. This could have been the ultimate Sandler movie -- its allA 80s in-jokes -- but hes barely there for it. And his total lack of involvement brings his fellow cast members down Monaghan is always a welcome presence with a fine gift for comedy but her scenes with Sandler feel like shes running lines against a cardboard box. James meanwhile has taken Sandlers lead and phones it all in. Josh Gad for his part doesnt need any help He has already achieved cosmic levels of tedium with that patented high-pitched screaming of his. The only actors who manage to shine are the aforementioned Dinklage in part because his characters whole shtick is to steamroll anyone else around him and Brian Cox clearly having the time of his life as a gung-ho admiral who just wants to bomb the crap out of random countries. Even the directorial choice largely backfires. Perhaps to help with the somewhat more ambitious sci-fi plotline Sandler amp; Co. airlifted in Chris Columbus -- he of Home Alone and the first two Harry Potter films. But Columbus despite a considerable string of box-office hits isnt known for the energy of his films. Sure he can showcase the energy of a whirlwind performer as he did with Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire. But when his somnolent direction is matched with a somnolent actor like Sandler the energy drains at an exponential pace. But then something odd happens. Pixels is so slow so dumb so filled with empty pauses and non sequiturs ... that it starts to approach cult-film levels of weirdness. Some of this is clearly intentional The aliens at one point actually give the earthlings a trophy for their victory in battle -- a real-life Qbert both cuddly and terrifying that whimpers and pees itself when scared. But most of it comes from the sheer rudderlessness of the movie an actor who doesnt want to be there a director who doesnt know what to do a conceit that runs on autopilot and a muddle of tones that feels like the screenwriting software is crashing around us as we watch. That results in isolated moments of dopey charm but the film itself cant be saved. A movie like Pixels should be stupid and energetic not stupid and lifeless.

Some of that is outside the control of director Chris Columbus who despite all his years as a competent Hollywood craftsman and a resume that includes not one but two major landmarks of popular entertainment (""Home Alone"" and the first Harry Potter movie) is stuck here making an Adam Sandler vehicle that features Kevin James as the president. (No not the president of the PTA or the service workers union or the Hair Club for Men. The president of the United States of America.) But a lot of ""Pixels"" is also sad on purpose in a way that percolates through the whole enterprise with a distinctively awful flavor not unlike that of Folgers mountain-grown coffee.Thats a somewhat appropriate reference for a movie in which aliens contact us by way of the ""Wheres the Beef?"" lady the Hall amp; Oates video for ""Shes Gone"" the ""Lucky Star""-era jewelry-bedecked Madonna and other antique cultural signifiers most of the audience probably wont recognize. Those random absurdities are by far the funniest things about ""Pixels"" along with the supporting performances by Peter Dinklage as an arrogant and unscrupulous video-game wizard named Fireblaster and Josh Gad as a deranged conspiracy nut about two micrometers shy of full-on psychosis. When we get to the purported main story about Sandler saving the world from alien space invaders who have interpreted the arcade games of the 1980s as a summons to an intergalactic throwdown the pain and pathos become nearly intolerable.""Pixels"" which was written by Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling and based on an original short film by Patrick Jean is more than just another lazy Adam Sandler movie in which he is actually the coolest guy in the universe but badly misunderstood (especially by the ladies). It is also another lazy Adam Sandler exercise in 80s nostalgia in which blah blah blah. Ladies please Form a line. Early in the movie Sandlers character an orange-jumpsuited tech installer named Sam Brenner finds himself in the closet - I know I know thats so funny but its an actual closet Where was I? Oh yeah so theres Sam inside a big walk-in closet with a hot divorcee played by Michelle Monaghan who is crying because her ex-husband is about to marry a 19-year-old Pilates instructor named Sinnamon with an S. (That sly touch must have gotten a high-five in the writers room because it comes up over and over again.) Its a mediocre meet-cute at best and then Sam bogarts the whole scene by complaining about his failed marriage and how his ex-wifes fertility doctor got her pregnant without bothering to use a turkey baster if you catch his drift. Women What can you do?I dont know why that level of narcissism should surprise me at this point. Sandlers entire performing career is that of a person who cant resist his compulsions and can barely be bothered to disguise them. Every time I sit through one of his movies and marvel once again that millions of apparently normal people find him amusing I feel like American guys are in worse shape than I thought. Sandler cant seem to stop himself from making movies in which ancient adolescent traumas must be revisited and avenged. In ""Grown Ups"" perhaps the most egregious Sandler film of them all (although thats a high bar) it was a long-ago basketball game won by the dirtbag locals over Sandlers character and his cool friends.This time around the Parsifal-like unhealed wound is the legacy of a video-game competition way back in 82 where 10-year-old Sam was bested at Donkey Kong by Fireblaster. (And where the accompanying music was oddly non-contemporaneous We hear ""We Will Rock You"" and Cheap Tricks ""Surrender"" over and over both of which are 70s hits.) And as in that scene in the closet with smokin weepin Divorce Mom Sandler cannot help thrusting himself into the limelight and baring his wounds even when hes supposed to be playing a decent and sensitive guy who relates well to women. Heres a dating tip fellas Announcing that youre a decent and sensitive guy and then launching into a monologue about your pain and loneliness sends kind of a weird signal. If you need further elucidation on this point please see me during office hours. You Might Also Like This problem only gets worse later in the movie to the point where you have to wonder whether anyone at Columbia Pictures who read this script has ever had contact with social media or for that matter contemporary social reality. Theres a scene thats meant to seal the deal between Sam whose true awesomeness has been revealed and Monaghans character who despite her closeted crying turns out to be a high-security military officer working closely with Sams old friend aka the dancing ignoramus POTUS as played by James. Literally the only tack Sam takes in this conversation is to praise this hardass sheath-skirted lieutenant colonel for her beauty ridicule her ex and goad her into dishing dirt on the aforementioned Sinnamon specifically her flounder-like eyes. I mean some of that could theoretically be funny in the right context but as packaged herein the message could not be clearer Doesnt matter if shes a military intelligence officer or a florist guys. The only thing she cares about is that you think shes cute. As for the elaborate CGI action sequences in ""Pixels"" when aliens attack our planet taking the form of hostile entities from Galaga and Centipede and Pac-Man and so on - dont worry fans the filmmakers are aware that Pac-Man is not evil and that becomes a plot point of sorts - I mean whatever. Its all perfunctory and embarrassing psychological theater designed to prove that Adam Sandler is way more of a badass than an entire team of Navy Seals put together. I enjoyed the appearance of Qbert an especially beloved and peculiar icon of that era but as someone who played various iterations of Donkey Kong for many hours when I was supposed to be reading Thucydides or Stendhal I have to say that the filmmakers have rendered the deeply strange metaphysical universe of that game in dumb and simplistic terms. So there.Everything thats actually amusing or lighthearted in ""Pixels"" is found on the periphery of the story. Josh Gad playing a deeply maladjusted and perhaps dangerous loser who lives with his grandmother in his 40s seems far more joyful and alive than Sandlers dead-eyed faux-cheerful world-redeeming hero. If you still want proof that money and fame do not guarantee happiness consider this dude who has always made movies about his own desperate quest for affection and acceptance and is now a comedian pushing 50 spinning a fable about how the wasted years of his youth will yield glory at last. Theres an accidental revelation at the dark heart of ""Pixels"" a competently executed film with an imaginative premise and a soul-sucking emptiness at its center. Dudes need to step up and face down evil for sure but its found in a much more treacherous place than the gator-clogged river of Frogger. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

(George Kraychyk) Peter Dinklage Ashley Benson and Josh Gad in ""Pixels"" (George Kraychyk) From left Michelle Monaghan Adam Sandler Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage (George Kraychyk) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday July 22 2015 156 PM Title ""Pixels"" Film Info Aliens use classic video-game characters to attack Earth (146). PG-13 Lewd humor. Area theaters. In 3-D where available. Someone please retire Adam Sandler. ""Pixels"" is the last straw for this has-been. Sandler and director Chris Columbus may have had the noblest intentions in their new movie -- they came to celebrate the affection Gen X guys have for classic video games. Instead they bury that warm feeling under moronic jokes lame action drooling for ""hot chicks"" and sad-assed middle-aged neuroses. Thanks to that ""Pixels"" is right down there with ""Jack and Jill"" as Sandlers dumbest flick ever. Here the boy-man plays a loser named Brenner. In 1982 Brenner and his pal Chewie are middle-schoolers who love arcades where Brenner comes in second in a gaming contest. Flash-forward to the present when Brenner is a mopey cable TV installer and Chewie (Kevin James) is -- wait for it -- President of the United States. But President Chewie has a problem Back in 82 NASA sent a video of Brenners arcade contest into space to say hello to aliens -- only the interstellar beings mistook it as a declaration of war. Ashley Benson in ""Pixels"" (George Kraychyk) As a result they unleash hell on Earth in the form of giant replicas of the creatures in Galaga Pac-Man and Centipede. Chewie needs his friends old-school gaming expertise to save humanity. Theyre aided by Col. Van Patton (Michelle Monaghan) a soon-to-be-divorced babe Brenner hit on while he fixed her TV; and two guys Brenner and Chewie knew as kids the jailbird Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) and the paranoid Ludlow (Josh Gad). They train Navy SEALS in Joust Asteroids and Defender and acquire a life-sized QBert as their mascot. Then an all-out assault requires the loser team to enter a mothership and fight a King Kong-sized Donkey Kong. Look I spent every weekend in 1982 (and all of my paper route money) in arcades but that didnt fry my brain enough to make ""Pixels"" fun. Every few summers something like this appears -- ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" ""Evolution"" ""R.I.P.D."" ""The Watch."" They want to be ""Ghostbusters"" but are just lousy. ""Pixels"" ratchets up the atrociousness. Every joke is forced every special effect is un-special. When the aliens use various Reagan-era pop-cultural artifacts (Max Headroom Hall amp; Oates Madonna) to deliver warnings its not even worth a smirk. Worse the movie twists itself around all of Sandlers tics. Forget ""Harry Potter"" director Columbus; this movie is a one-player game. All the stars usual signposts are here moronic middle-ager winning over an attractive woman; a kid looking up to a doofus as a role model; people making up nicknames based on appearances. As for Sandler himself he shlumps around so lazily hes like a Robotron. James just follows his pals lead enduring jokes about his weight. Gad is momentously annoying. Dinklage speaking in an odd urban patois thats incongruous and offensive (and also unexplained) is the only real actor here but is stuck in a clown show. A ragtag group of goofballs fighting bigger-than-life forces can work but the dipstick ""Pixels"" is as much fun as a broken joystick and not even half as smart. jneumaiernydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews adam sandler kevin james peter dinklage josh gad michelle monaghan ashley benson Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Do you love the arcade classics like Centipede and Pac-Man? But didnt you always wish those games had Adam Sandler yammering strategy on the sidelines? The makers of Pixels really hope that people like you exist as well as anyone who can stomach Sandler at all. Dont concern yourself too much with the plot (they didnt). You only need to know that aliens are invading earth disguised as beloved 8-bit avatars and the coin jockeys of yore including Sandlers lonely tech geek are our only hope of survival. Stranger things happen in Pixels Kevin James can play the President of the United States (proving theres still hope for Chris Christie) and rise heroically to the occasion when the battleground calls for a stone-cold expert at that descending claw game. The usually appealing Michelle Monaghan as a military officer can somehow fall for Sandlers schmo without requiring him to brush his teeth (a running joke) or shape up at all. But the truly mystifying thing about the movie is how desperately it caters to Gen-X junk nostalgia without bothering to think that maybe those Reagan-era kids have grown up a bit. Pixels plays the Ghostbusters card hard clothing its warriors in matching jumpsuits and swarming them with cheering New York crowds. But these gestures feel unearned. The movies graphics have a blockiness that registers as cheap not sly while even the presence of Peter Dinklage as a vain videogame champ cant help but play like a casting stunt. Sandlers exhaustion is obvious. How many extra lives does the guy get?

Actually you probably wouldnt imagine such a scenario because thats not just a lazy fantasy but a fantasy about laziness and when most of us envision ourselves being the best that we can be its not because we want to put in the least amount of effort and growth possible. Perhaps it should be expected though that Adam Sandler the movie star many of us most readily associate with creative sloth and arrested development stars in a space-invader movie in which all the hero has to do is play video games from his childhood. Sure the live-action versions of Pac-Man Donkey Kong and Centipede require some real-life gun-zapping and platform-jumping but the point of ""Pixels"" -- other than some genuinely thrilling special effects of matter evaporating into digitized blocks of confetti -- is the dumb message that guys who peaked in middle school totally deserve hot girlfriends because of their awesome gaming skills. Also Read Adam Sandlers Pixels Tilting Toward Soft 25 Million Debut at Box Office ""Pixels"" begins like many a Sandler film with a crisis of masculinity framed in cheap utilitarian camera work (from director Chris Columbus). Schlubby tech set-up guy Brenner (Sandler) gets upset when his beautiful emotionally vulnerable customer Violet (Michelle Monaghan) rebuffs his attempt to kiss her in her closet where shed been drinking and weeping about her impending divorce. Instead of slinking away for being a shady creeper hes eager to show Violet who happens to be a high-ranking military officer that she should have made out with her handyman all along because his childhood buddy happens to be the president (Kevin James bringing just slightly more dignity to the Oval Office than Donald Trump would). The silver medalist at the 1982 Worldwide Video Arcade Championship Brenner is the first to figure out the scripts moronic conceit that aliens are attacking Earth through the form of old-school video games. Brenner his former rival (Peter Dinklage) and a fellow video-game prodigy (Josh Gad) from the old days are then recruited by the military to fight the space invaders because this version of America apparently contains only three people who have ever played arcade games. Also Read Adam Sandler Plays Lip Flip Belts Out a Duet With Jimmy Fallon (Video) Theres a six-minute sketch on the classic animated series ""Futurama"" with the same exact scenario and Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowlings script -- adapted from a short by Patrick Jean -- fails to bring anything new to the table. Gad gets to show off his ace comic timing while Dinklage is frequently amusing as a mulleted convict who talks like a 70s pimp. But ""Pixels"" is ultimately a thoroughly numbing experience not least because all the characters are doomed by a psychological flatness more two-dimensional than any arcade-game screen. Even by the standards of a B-movie ""Pixels"" sinks because Sandlers nasty punch-down insult comedy is aimed at anyone who isnt a ""good guy."" Fat guys get fat jokes female divorcees are generalized as ugly and one older supposedly not-hot-enough woman is compared to Gandalf. (The only ones who escape these jokes are Serena Williams and Martha Stewart who appear as themselves and apparently got deals protecting them from the films ""screw everyone who isnt exactly like me"" ethos.) Also Read Hotel Transylvania TV Series in Development at Sony Sandler may have signed on to ""Pixels"" to cash in on fading nostalgia for the 80s and Reagan era-set cultural products (like his own ""Wedding Singer""). But the films aggressive self-pity abrasive insularity and repellent male entitlement -- however seemingly benign their iteration here -- speak to the contemporary video-game culture too.

The goofy Jean-Claude Van Damme action movie nearly tripled its 35 million budget internationally but it was universally panned by critics. Perhaps the biggest flaw was the eventual appearance of fan favorite character Blanka -- a ferocious beast in the game who just looked like a poorly-costumed actor in the movie. ) ""Wing Commander"" (1999) Box Office 11.57 million. This movie bombed in theaters and was booed by critics. But at least this Freddy Prinze Jr. movie really really REALLY makes you appreciate ""Star Wars.""

What happens when Eric Roberts rounds up a bunch of hot fighter chicks to fight for a 10 million prize ""any time anywhere""? Nothing good. ) ""In the Name of the King A Dungeon Siege Tale"" (2008) Box Office 13 million. Jason Statham Ray Liotta and Burt Reynolds may have thought they were starring in the next ""Lord of the Rings""-style fantasy epic (or they just needed a paycheck). But in reality this adaptation of Microsoft role-playing game ""Dungeon Siege"" was just the next Uwe Boll bomb. ) ""Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li"" (2009) Box Office 12.7 million (2009). Hopes for some kind of redemption for the beloved Capcom fighting game -- or a Chris Klein comeback -- were immediately dashed when this ""Street Fighter"" got a beating from critics. ) ""Need for Speed"" (2014) Box Office 43.6 million. In his first lead big-screen role post-""Breaking Bad"" Aaron Paul failed to rev up audiences playing a street racer who joins a cross-country race with revenge in mind.

Daily Edition Login to download Pixels Film Review 900 AM PDT 7/22/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Fun for a bit but overstays its welcome. TWITTER The ghosts of video games past arise in Chris Columbus slice of 80s nostalgia starring Adam Sandler Kevin James and Michelle Monaghan. Within the rarefied realm of 1980s video game nostalgia Pixels is no Wreck-It Ralph. At isolated moments a tolerably amusing send-up of alien-invasion disaster movies in which the attackers are video arcade-era renegades arrived to gobble up as many famous landmarks as possible this one-note comedy runs out of gas within an hour (it is based on a short film) and should have been trimmed to a neat 90 minutes. Although ostensibly aimed at 40-somethings who grew up on Pac-Man Donkey Kong and all the other games revered by first-generation players this mildly suggestive PG-13-rated romp may well play best with the veterans little kids who will find Frogger and Qbert oh so cute. For those adults without any deep emotional investment in the early totems of modern geekdom the most intriguing aspect of Chris Columbus first directorial outing since Percy Jackson amp; the Olympians five years ago is the opportunity to sample a potential Chris Christie presidency via Kevin James. Even if the comparison stems from nothing more than their both being plus-sized gents the fact of the matter is that we havent had a roly-poly president since William Howard Taft more than a century ago so the mere sight of a a chief executive with button-busting girth is sufficiently novel to provoke an ongoing double-take. That this fictional leader of the free world is a clueless buffoon in an Adam Sandler movie is another matter. As a kid James Will Cooper was the best friend of Sandlers Sam Brenner which explains why the latter a sad sack lifes-passed-him-by home video system installer gets called to the White House in an emergency. The president remembers Sams one brush with greatness back in 1982 when the kids brilliance at recognizing patterns in video games made him legendary in Pac-Man circles and earned him second place (behind Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant) in the Donkey Kong championships. Read more Pixels 1980s Arcade Nostalgia Permeates Premiere of Adam Sandlers New Movie While the military is clueless as to the source of the pulsating glowing cubes raining down on Guam and eating away at soldiers Sam knows the perfect Sherlock for this case fellow childhood nerd and full-time conspiracy theorist Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) who recognizes the source at once Galaga the beloved 80s intergalactic shooting game. Ludlow further deduces that aliens have intercepted a capsule that was sent into deep space bearing copies of video games and have interpreted them as a declaration of war by the planet Earth. As have modern monsters from Godzilla to Transformers to Team America these space invaders harbor a particular attraction to architectural landmarks so the Taj Mahal gets chomped on before their attention turns to London where the Allies resolve to take a stand. When conventional methods prove ineffective the portly president commands ""Let the nerds take over"" (apparently unaware that they already have) to the dismay of a macho British commando leader (Sean Bean) and a trigger-happy U.S. admiral (Brian Cox) who dont understand that pixels will withstand a nuke much better than will people. Next on the invaders list is New York City where bad-boy long-ago champ Fire Blaster (Peter Dinklage) is released from prison to help the cause. But the predictable city grid provides an ideal playing field for jumbo Pac-Men to move block by city block chomping obstructions like so many pac-dots. Chances are that by this point most grown-ups will feel theyve indulged in enough nostalgia for youthful hours frittered away in arcades at least for one evening. But since 60 minutes doesnt quite qualify as a feature-length running time screenwriters Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling needed to pad things out with a lengthy state dinner that serves two purposes to allow Sam and lovely army officer/White House insider Violet (Michelle Monaghan) some non-stressed time together after a marathon of sparring and to provide big-talking little guy Fire Blaster with his dream a date with Serena Williams. Gamers finally grasp their moment of glory at the climactic Washington D.C. showdown during which agitators currently arguing for the defacement or destruction of certain honorific monuments will no doubt feel a charge of excitement. For everyone else including President Christ-- ... er Cooper their misspent youths are suddenly vindicated and rewarded while the nation can rest easy until the next wave of aliens monsters and/or giant creatures arises like another ghost from a machine. With the exception of Monaghan who seems like a beautiful member of some other species amid this ragtag bunch of comics and slumming character actors everyone here is doing shtick theyve long since mastered underplaying in Sandlers case to sometimes mildly amusing effect and charging ahead like bulls where James and Gad are concerned. The 3D proves undeniably effective in some of the gaming and attack interludes.

"Pixels Review Its Adam Sandler vs. Pac-Man | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Pixels Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 33 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Sony July 22 2015 | 0900AM PT Adam Sandler presses a lot of buttons but mostly phones it in with this dim-witted 80s nostalgia trip. An adorable life-sized version of Qbert is easily the most engaging character in ""Pixels"" a dimwitted 80s nostalgia trip best appreciated by those who have waited years for Adam Sandlers fine-grained intelligence and Chris Columbus filmmaking mastery to finally converge. For the remaining 99% of the moviegoing population this slapdash casually sexist revenge-of-the-nerds fantasy offers some mild visual distraction with its massive CGI renderings of Pac-Man Donkey Kong and other old-school videogame characters that have been co-opted here by malevolent space invaders challenging Earth to the mother of all intergalactic arcade battles. Commercially the somewhat novel combination of Sandlers bro-comedy antics and an unexpected dose of geek appeal should help Sonys July 24 Stateside release enjoy a few late-summer bonus rounds at the box office aided by strong awareness and 3D ticket premiums. Commercial returns should remain steady even if word-of-mouth reactions fail to rise much above the level of ""Well at least that was better than Grown Ups 2."" Which ""Pixels"" probably is insofar as its highly marketable gaming elements and ostensibly kid-friendly appeal have diluted some of the more offensive aspects of Sandlers comic signature. There is alas more than a little residual misogyny in the insulting development of the movies female characters (if thats the word) and in this case the sexism feels not just reflexive but almost obligatory given the male-dominated videogame culture being celebrated in the high-concept low-ambition screenplay by Tim Herlihy (""Grown Ups 2"" ""Big Daddy"") and Timothy Dowling (""Just Go With It""). It begins with a formative moment at the 1982 arcade-game world championships where 13-year-old gaming enthusiast Sam Brenner (Anthony Ippolito) narrowly loses first place to a mullet-wearing smartass named Eddie ""the Fire Blaster"" Plant (Andrew Bambridge) after an ill-fated game of ""Donkey Kong."" Some 30 years later Sam (now played by Sandler) works a dead-end job installing home-entertainment systems in Washington D.C. Faring somewhat better is his childhood best friend Will Cooper (Kevin James) who is now president of the United States -- a development that is wisely left unexplained. Conveniently POTUS winds up turning to Sam and their other pal Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) after a series of mysterious attacks by what appear to be characters from ancient videogame templates. The explanation is clear -- dumb but clear. Evil extraterrestrials intercepted an 80s-era NASA time capsule containing footage of those old single-player classics and mistook them for a declaration of war. Now theyve returned the challenge by scheduling a series of skirmishes with Earth each one taking on the interface of a different videogame; if we lose its game over for the whole planet. Happily Sam and Ludlow wind up proving themselves early on (and shaming the overgrown military jocks played by Brian Cox and Sean Bean) by clobbering the aliens in a few rounds of ""Centipede."" Next they manage to track down their old nemesis Eddie (now Peter Dinklage) for a rowdy game of ""Pac-Man"" a car-chase sequence in which the beloved yellow dot-gobbler has been reborn as a villainous giant sphere munching his way through the streets of New York. (Denis Akiyama turns up as original ""Pac-Man"" creator Toru Iwatani while the real-life Iwatani makes a brief appearance elsewhere.) Its here that Columbus past experience with f/x-heavy fantasy (on the Harry Potter and Percy Jackson franchises) comes into play. In bringing these outmoded videogame creations to mammoth destructive life the director and his visual-effects team have at once updated their crude low-resolution look and skillfully integrated them into live-action the effect amplified somewhat by the films 3D conversion (as stated in the press notes a more accurate title would have been ""Voxels""). If the edges look a bit rougher than usual thats wholly in keeping with the games relatively primitive aesthetic. As for the movies apocalyptic stakes theyre treated with no more consequence than an air-hockey match a few smashed-up historic landmarks notwithstanding. At its silliest and most endurable ""Pixels"" plays like an extended ode to not just Nintendo culture but also 80s culture in general; that much is clear from the soundtrack with its generous sampling of Zapp Tears for Fears and Loverboy plus two different flare-ups of ""We Will Rock You VonLichten."" And then theres the aliens amusing habit of communicating with Earth by way of old Madonna clips Hall amp; Oates musicvideos and (at one point) a giant talking replica of Max Headroom. Pop-cultural nostalgia of course practically constitutes its own genre by this point and ""Pixels"" is hardly the first feature-length valentine to our fondly remembered mass-entertainment touchstones. If only the movie in front of us actually fit that description or truly conveyed the addictive pleasures of gaming rather than serving up another barrage of witless one-liners strained reaction shots and aggressively inane celebrity cameos. (Serena Williams turning up randomly at a soiree ""They promised me an island if I did this."") Really the viewer would be better off spending 98 minutes browsing old ""Bomberman"" walk-throughs on YouTube than trying to care what happens to Lt. Col. Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) a tough-talking weapons expert who supplies our heroes with pixel-blasting light cannons. Her real purpose alas is to carry on a cringe-inducing chemistry-free flirtation with Sam when shes not watching him fight from the sidelines. Violet also has an earnest young moppet (Matt Lintz) and an ex-husband whose infidelity sends her weeping into her bedroom closet with a bottle of hooch -- all told the sort of ""character development"" that makes you wish the writers had made her a brainless bimbo and been done with it. Still Monaghan might as well be playing Medea next to Ashley Benson who gives a wordless eye-candy performance as Lady Lisa the scantily clad sword-wielding fantasy heroine of Ludlows dreams. Even more grievously wasted is Jane Krakowski as the First Lady whose most important scene requires her to laugh and decorate a cake. This isnt exactly ""Gamergate The Movie"" but intentionally or not it captures the movements boorish ethos with dispiriting accuracy. James beer-guzzling POTUS is at the very least a welcome alternative to Paul Blart and Dinklage has his usual fun playing a small chap with a big attitude. Gad who scored a mid-sized hit earlier this year with ""The Wedding Ringer"" goes crazily over-the-top as the eccentric nerd-crackpot of the group standing in sharp contrast to Sandler who has rarely seemed like such a nonentity onscreen. Over the years the actors delight in playing the egregiously stupid man-child has slowly calcified into laziness bordering on fatigue; where Sandler once exulted in our outrage (and frequently our laughter) he now seems barely capable of mustering enough effort to carry a scene let alone advance to level 255 of ""Galaga.""

Steve Johnson says March 29 2016 at 1057 pm In the movie Pixels at the word tournament there are 2 discrepancies I found. First is at kick off of the tournament there is a guy who makes reference to the karate kid. Although a very good 80s movie it did not come out til 1984 the tournament is to take place July 26th 1982. Second is after being beaten Cooper and Sam are talking Cooper tells Sam not to worry because he is still going to go to MIT and invent something that will make him a millionaire and marry Olivia Newton John Sam in return says he was thinking Samantha Fox. Although Samantha Fox was in deed a 8os female artist she was only 16 in 82 and not yet the sexy sing we came to know her as. The third thing was in the same conversation where Sam ends the conversation by saying ""well there is always Madonna"" . We all know Madonna is a 80s icon but she didnt release her first single until late 1982 and wouldnt have been known by these boys in July of 82. Im not taking anything away from this movie because I really loved it as I do most ALL of Adam Sandler movies. I just felt compelled to point out those few things. Reply Thomas lewis says December 29 2015 at 704 pm I think the movie was pretty cool I loved it Reply Steven Arnold says October 14 2015 at 1154 pm Just saw the movie on DVD. I found it enjoyable somewhere in the middle scale of Sandlers films. My reaction to your review is if you dont like nerd comedies and bro-mance films dont review them. There is a lot of classic Sandler here. But Im getting tired of seeing him raked over the coals for purely political reasons (""misogynistic"" etc.). Pixels is a fine film certainly popcorn-worthy and great for little kids. My one complaint would be that as Sandlers films become larger ensembles theres less space in the movie to enjoy Sandlers own characters. But thats his choice as a filmmaker. Reply Anybody says May 17 2016 at 1007 am Seriously? Did you REALLY say ""If you dont like ""___X___"" you shouldnt review it""???? THATS your logic? Do you not understand how utterly ridiculous that statement is? Reply Michelle says August 8 2015 at 836 pm Pixels is actually very funny. I do like Adam Sandlers comedy style and I know hes not everyones cup of tea. However this is not supposed to be a deep emotional award-winning drama. Most movie goers arent looking for the next Oscar winner. Just the hope of escaping reality for a couple of hours and laughing. I got my moneys worth. Reply Liam says July 27 2015 at 438 pm So the first topic of your review is that you bash Sandler. Basically you bash his intelligence by giving a sarcastic remark about his ""fine-grained"" intelligence but do not seem to back up that claim. Intelligence being a very subjective term needs reinforcing evidence. Take ""Punch Drunk Love"" for example a very sweet odd indie-type film. He really acts in this movie and puts thought into his character ""Barry"". The humor albeit dark is also very cute and fun. However there is a central plot and theme easy enough to follow. Another example Mr. Deeds Sandler plays a sweethearted character who is knew to the New York world he learns what it is like to be stabbed in the back. Next time instead of bashing Sandlers intelligence as the very first thing you said you should make this reviews topic about the movie. Reply Michael P. Shipley says July 26 2015 at 1129 am Grown Ups 2 made 246984278 (80m budget) and had a Cinemascore of B. Eveyone loves that movie except Variety and most of the other media intelligentsia. Why so anti Sandler? Seems like a petty personal vendetta to me. Didnt he give enough to your LGBT charities or higher enough blacks or treat all women like the princesses they are? Reply Stanley O says July 26 2015 at 1007 am Mr. Sandler doesnt give a sht about Varietys ongoing attempt to destroy his career. Its time for this lame BS to stop. Move on. Reply Gaia Glockner says July 24 2015 at 313 pm I dont care what this says. I believe that Adam Sandler and Kevin James are a great duo and Ive been a fan of Sandlers movies since I was a child. Just because you didnt enjoy that movie doesnt mean you have to flat out tell people to not see it. Everyone has different tastes in humor and may find this movie hilarious. Those who didnt enjoy it okay thats fine with me but not try to ""convince"" me that any other movie would better than this and that Sandler is the worst actor ever. Just back off And Chris Columbus has made great movies. I loved the first two Harry Potters they really captured the books image and thats that. The Percy Jackson movies could have been better but were still good visually. And this movie is hilarious. I loved it and thought it looked visually amazing. But everyone is entitled to their opinions. Reply Tara says July 24 2015 at 130 pm I just saw this movie with my kids and they loved it and so did I. They laughed so hard they continued to laugh while we traveled back home. I think Adam Sandler and Kevin James make a good team. In my opinion Adam Sandler is up there with Jim Carey. What ever ingredients Adams comedian act have is just who he is as a funny actor and I would not want him to change. Furthermore the fact that Kevin James being the president of the United states in this movie is an explanation in its self because as children we are told that we can become whom ever we choose to become as long we work hard at it and never give up. Reply Kade says July 24 2015 at 1117 am I dug the trailer until I saw Adam Sandler Kevin James and Josh Gad. I said nope not gonna waste my money on this garbage. I find all three to be painfully unfunny. Reply profnickd1967 says July 24 2015 at 944 am You did the Social Justice Warriors the favor of using the buzzword ""sexism"" in the preface to the review so they not only know its verboten to see the movie but they also dont even need to read the rest of the review. Reply CharBarn says July 24 2015 at 620 am You lost me at ""sexism."" Reply mortimer aeinhard. says July 23 2015 at 420 pm Oh pipe down. All you people with your bad reviews. So what if it was based on a short video? Lots of movies or shows are based on short videos and end up a success thats not a viable reason to call it terrible. It wasnt sucky or a bore Ive been going through a panic attack and watching the movie tonight actually made me forget about stuff and relax a little. It was funny and who wouldnt want to be in actual video games? Only thing I didnt like was Qbert turning into Lady Lisa and making little Qbert babies with Ludlow. Over all it was an okay movie certainly doesnt deserve all you people attacking the cast just because. Reply Todd Jacobs says July 23 2015 at 1247 pm Sandler did to his movies the same thing that venereal diseases did to sex. Except theres no cure for Sandler. Reply Todd Jacobs says July 23 2015 at 1244 pm Sandler is horrible and unfortunately Sandler doesnt realize it... Reply Moviecritic says July 22 2015 at 655 pm If this movie is a disaster can you image how bad the Netflix Movies are. Reply dmoney666 says July 23 2015 at 540 am That deal INFURIATED me. Of all the talented people out there HE gets a deal like that. I love Netflix but that was an awful call. I hope they like burning money. Reply rjbailey says July 22 2015 at 541 pm Reblogged this on Locating Frankensteins Brain and commented Almost exactly what I thought it would be. Reply stevenkovacs says July 22 2015 at 249 pm Filmed in Toronto[?] Reply ScratStitch says July 22 2015 at 123 pm ""a dimwitted 80s nostalgia trip best appreciated by those who have waited years for Adam Sandlers fine-grained intelligence and Chris Columbus filmmaking mastery to finally converge."" So wheres your Punch Drunk Love? How about your Harry Potter movies? Yup. These guys are total failures right? Reply anon says July 22 2015 at 325 pm Punch-Drunk Love is a Paul Thomas Anderson movie that Adam Sandler happened to star in. Chris Columbus only directed the first two HP movies and they are arguably the weakest of the series. Reply Gaia Glockner says July 24 2015 at 316 pm Not a Harry Potter fan are you? The first two were the best They looked amazing and had every little detail that was in the books. The weakest was the 5th and 6th one where they screwed everything up and left out crucial details and just...changed the story completely. anonymous says July 22 2015 at 1259 pm I wont go see this unless there is literally nothing to do this weekend...oh wait paddle boarding going outside american beer and girls....ya way better than sitting staring at giant screen like a zombie Reply anonymous says July 22 2015 at 1253 pm I really want to see Adam Sandler as Happy Gilmore again. Reply Oy Vey says July 22 2015 at 1220 pm Its this years R.I.P.D. -- which means Not Good. Reply John Miller says July 22 2015 at 1114 am Sandler needs to be banned from movies. Easily the laziest ""actor"" in recent memory. Reply Judi says July 22 2015 at 1133 am This sounds like typical Sandler absolutely dreadful. Reply Mike says July 22 2015 at 1050 am Ugh - Columbus has always been a hack - and teaming with Sandler and James just shows that hes actually given up on ever trying to be a real director. Reply Royal Graffiti says July 22 2015 at 1013 am Reblogged this on Royal Graffiti. Reply dmoney666 says July 22 2015 at 949 am I wish I could understand how Adam Sandler is even allowed to step foot in Hollywood anymore. Seriously. I REFUSE to waste another dime or another minute of my life watching any more of his horrible movies. He hasnt been funny for 15 years. Yet hundreds of talented people who are dying to break in to the business continue to struggle on. Amazing. Reply Gayle Cornell says July 28 2015 at 657 pm With all the trash on the big screen you grip about this; I thought the movie was fun and all the adults I was with loved it and the kids laughed all the way till the end. I think there is a lot of people out there still loving Sandler films and we are college educated and all age groups. Dont waste your money on a fun filled film go watch the trashy stuff you seem to enjoy. Reply Matt says July 22 2015 at 949 am Do we ever get to see the actual aliens?

For the kind of cheap joystick fun that only a musty video arcade can bring? Well have I got a movie for you. Its called ""Wreck-it Ralph"" and it came out three years ago. That wildly inventive cartoon is not however to be confused with the new ""Pixels"" an extremely loud live-action mess starring Adam Sandler and Kevin James and currently invading theaters. The idea behind this chuckleheaded comedy is that more than 30 years ago film of a video-arcade gaming contest was sent into space along with other modern pop-cultural artifacts in hopes that it would be discovered and watched by some alien civilization. And it was. Except they saw it as a declaration of war - and are now invading Earth using weaponized skyscraper-sized versions of some old gamer classics. Who can we turn to? Who else but those pasty nerds who used to spend their afternoons blasting away the original space invaders? Its a pretty silly idea even for a comedy and its not helped by its stars. Sandler continues in his well-worn rut of playing a smart sensitive underachiever surrounded by hapless idiots; James plays the biggest one of those idiots an old pal and illiterate schlub whos also by the way the current president of the United States. Hey it could happen. But the movie never happens. James idiocy is far from endearing and Sandler never drops his smirk - even as hes wooing the out-of-his-league Michelle Monaghan. (Who of course falls for him anyway - stuff like that always seems to happen in Sandler movies especially when hes producing.) Supporting actors Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage do at least bring some commitment and comedy to the proceedings as two other eccentric gamers; Dinklage sporting a groovy hair-metal look is particularly funny as a preening lothario. And director Chris Columbus gets a few mild smiles out of a decades detritus by scoring the whole movie to thundering early MTV rock and having the aliens using other crudely artificial 80s icons - Max Headroom Madonna - for their digitized messages. But those small pleasures are lost in a picture which lurches from scene to scene without the tension ever building or the jokes ever paying off. You can see the calculations of the filmmakers - Hey lets put in a cute kid Lets add a funny animated sidekick - but you cant see why they wanted to make this film in the first place. Ultimately the whole thing turns into just a low-grade ""Ghostbusters"" knock-off with our heroes running around in matching jumpsuits shooting ""light cannons"" at CGI menaces (and unfortunately nothing nearly as funny as the Stay-Puft Marshmallow man to shoot at). Theres a happy ending one more slightly risque sex joke and roll credits. ""Game Over"" the movie declares. But that was true before it even started. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Pixels (PG-13) Sony (105 min.) Directed by Chris Columbus. With Adam Sandler Kevin James Michelle Monaghan Peter Dinklage Josh Gad.
