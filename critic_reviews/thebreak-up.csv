As Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) spends hours preparing for a lavish dinner Gary (Vince Vaughn) returns home without the shopping and puts his feet up in front of the sports channel. It may sound like lame stereotype-driven humour but sharp dialogue and detailed observations make it a good deal funnier than you might expect. As in most of Vaughns other comedies (Wedding Crashers Old School) unexpected biting remarks bring bursts of laughter. Shes been through a lot protests Brooke when Gary criticises her troubled sister. Of dick he proclaims.Clearly this is no PC outing Brookes camp brother is ridiculed (albeit mostly for his refusal to come out) and Vaughns regular sidekick Jon Favreau makes a virtue of his sexist remarks. But Favreaus bold character Johnny is one of the funniest in the film Brookes sex-mad art gallery boss and her camp assistant are less successful comic figures. This is at its most amusing when the warring couples attempts to aggravate each other backfire such as when Brookes token date - designed to make Gary jealous - ends up bonding with Gary over a computer game. The Break-Up is at its least successful when addressing the issue of romance. While implying that the pair love each other deep down the film is uncertain about their ultimate compatibility which - however realistic - makes it less emotionally affecting than many of its contemporaries. Still at least its funnier.

Shes a saint. Just split already 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Break-Up Romantic comedy. Starring Jennifer Aniston Vince Vaughn and Joey Lauren Adams. Directed by Peyton Reed. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Romantic comedy is the most formulaic of genres and so any romantic comedy that breaks from the formula deserves credit for being adventurous -- even ""The Break-Up"" which is in many ways a misbegotten conflicted mess. At least they tried something new a romantic comedy with serious moments designed to get by on more than charm that explores the pitfalls of relationships. This can be done -- ask Woody Allen -- but its not easy and ""The Break-Up"" doesnt come near succeeding. Instead of investing in the identity of the characters the movie is happy to leave them in the usual cardboard zone of capable career woman and glib good-natured oaf. Instead of finding a story to match the movies seriousness of purpose it devises a mechanical setup for jokes A man and a woman in an estranged relationship each refuses to leave the condo that they own together. Yet having devised this comic mechanism the movie offers nothing funny just a series of sour situations. Making a romantic comedy into a somber exercise is not the same as making it serious and making it unpleasant is not the same as making it significant. ""The Break-Up"" provides a series of nonsensical confrontations played neither for laughs nor for frowns nor for verisimilitude. Imagine watching Bergmans ""Scenes From a Marriage"" except without good scenes without a marriage (legal or spiritual) and without people worthy of anybodys attention even each others. Now imagine something even worse. ""The Break-Up"" has received a lot of publicity as the movie that Jennifer Aniston made after her own breakup with Brad Pitt which marked the beginning of a romance with Vince Vaughn. If thats the case lets hope that Vaughn is nothing like the slob he plays here. Among the many discordant elements is that the breakup depicted is not one involving two people of goodwill coming to an impasse. Rather it involves a good woman coming to realize that shes with a boring inconsiderate stupid lout. And the audience is supposed to root for them to get back together. Huh? If the movie has anything to recommend it aside from novelty its that the handful of argument scenes have the ring of truth and director Peyton Reed (""Down With Love"") lets them breathe and develop. Conversations are extended and go in unexpected directions which is unusual in modern movies. The talk may be about things like who forgot to buy lemons and whos not washing the dishes and why the boyfriend wants a pool table in the living room and thus of limited interest. But it feels like real talk and thats something. Aniston is up for it emotionally ready ever-reactive always thinking. She plays Brooke the manager of a Chicago art gallery who has been living with Gary (Vaughn) for two years picking up his socks cooking his meals and suppressing the impulse to scream when he comes home every night and plays video games. After a pre-credits sequence showing how they met the picture takes up their story just as the relationship is hitting the skids. The romance is gone. Hes selfish. He thinks shes nagging him. They decide to split up. So far so good but from there on the movie is at odds with itself. The condo-sharing thing might have been funny except that he is torturing her a lot more than shes torturing him. It becomes disturbing. Likewise the story of a woman coming to terms with a pointless relationship might have borne fruit as well except that the movie is locked into the notion that she secretly wants him back. Theres no satisfaction in watching this. Vaughn who co-wrote the story suffers the worst for it. Unlike Aniston who has a sympathetic and largely reactive role Vaughn has the impossible task of taking his uncouth persona and giving it a sensitive soul. The combination is lethal. In moments he might have seemed funny Vaughn is insufferable and in scenes in which hes supposed to be sensitive hes lost. In several of his emotional encounters with Aniston he gets a frozen smile on his face that doesnt look like love but indigestion. Aniston can do better than this. Clearly she wants to do something serious something different but this isnt it at least not in a good way. She needs to follow Meg Ryans path out of the boyfriend movies and out of the land of perky and find out what shes really about. In the meantime anyone who wants to see a serious relationship comedy that works should skip this and see ""The Puffy Chair."" -- Advisory Sexual situations and Aniston says a naughty word once.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 2 2006 425 PM Lets Just Be Friends The awkward scenes of The Break-Up. By Michael Agger Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston in TheBreak-Up About 10 minutes into The Break-Up (Universal) the new comedy with Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughn I was overcome by a strange feeling. Aniston plays Brooke an uptight gallery worker. Vaughn plays Gary a ""wacky"" Polish-American tour guide. They stand in the Chicago condo they share bickering over who should do the dishes. The argument escalates into more personal territory with Aniston accusing Vaughn of not caring enough about her. The scene keeps going and going and then it occurs to me These two are actually going to ... act. Did I walk into a Woody Allen movie by mistake? Im in favor of more acting in Hollywood movies but its a lot to ask of our celebrities. Once they establish a persona we do not like them to deviate from it much and it would be hard to find at present two stars more trapped in their personas than Vaughn and Aniston. In The Break-Up Vaughn is meant to be an overweight working-class schlub but he cant remove that winners glint from his eye. (Hes entered Bill Murray territory; you like him just for showing up.) Aniston fares slightly better as a neurotic but ""fun"" girl capable of eating a hot dog at a Cubs game. Sometime during the Brad Pitt years however she acquired model-perfect posture and a general air of unease. Watching her stiff performance brought to mind a great John Updike quote ""Celebrity is a mask that eats into the face."" Advertisement The Break-Up does have two advantages Like those penguins slithering across the Antarctic ice men and women everywhere search for a mate and The Break-Up is a tolerable date movie. It also provides an opportunity to indulge your inner tabloid reader. Aniston and Vaughn became a couple during the making of the film but I couldnt detect much evidence of their off-set liaison. Its probably bad news for the movies fortunes that Vaughn generates more sparks with his old Swingers flame Jon Favreau--who plays Garys best friend--than he does with Aniston. Vaughn is at his best when the movie allows him to revert to type. He has several tour-bus scenes that are basically occasions for stand-up and he may be the best trash-talker in the history of cinema--who else could ad-lib a cascade of insults (directed at a 12-year-old) during a game of Madden football? For her part Aniston does not have many occasions to cut loose and show off her inner Rachel--in one scene her character is declaring her independence; in the next shes thinking up some trick to get Garys attention. This may be an attempt to portray a realistic pingponging of emotions but mostly Anistons eyes appear very very moist all the time. It also doesnt help matters (in terms of characterization) that the camera lavishes the sort of attention on her midriff that was once given to Marlene Dietrichs legs. The midriff keeps showing up framed in expensive tailored ""casual"" outfits as though it were trying to steal the movie. Chicago as always seems extremely attractive on-screen (there is only the barest hint of the towns cruel winter). The art direction and clothes are true to a certain cross-section of young professionals from that town where everyone looks like they just came from a Banana Republic shopping spree. Of the supporting cast Jason Bateman has a funny mock-sinceredelivery as a creepy real-estate broker and John Michael Higgins earns some cheap laughs appearing as the dreaded a cappella singer. With this genial bunch and the occasional good line theres no reason not to see The Break-Up but theres also no reason assuming the date is going well not to skip it and order dessert.

Couch-potatoey guy in a long relationship with fed-up gal buys the wrong number of lemons for a party and later fails to express excitement at the prospect of washing dishes. This prompts fed-up gal to break up with couch-potatoey guy. But both couch-potatoey guy and fed-up gal refuse to leave their condo. Guy plays video games with gals date. Gal gets body waxed struts naked in front of guy. Guy ogles gal. Rat-a-tat humor and screwball sexual byplay prevail. Thats the preview give or take. It promises a sharp funny comedy about the end of a relationship -- and no question its often hysterically droll. But dont head into The Break-Up expecting a frothy summer romance or even a frothy summer post-romance because it isnt. This is a much darker and more desperate film than the trailer suggests a seriocomic portrait of two lovers crash-and-burn that features some of the most rancorous convincing arguments Ive ever seen in a mainstream Hollywood comedy. Bile spews with alarming realism. Director Peyton Reeds two previous features films the mannered Down With Love and the sprightly Bring It On share with The Break-Up a restless intelligence that itches to enliven stock situations and characters. And at first sight couch-potatoey guy (Gary played by Vince Vaughn) and fed-up gal (Brooke played by Jennifer Aniston) could not seem more pre-fab. Gary is a gaming-addicted sports-obsessed slobby insensitive lump. Brooke is a controlling career-focused judgmental Type-A nag. What saves this pair from mere melodramatic huffing is Reeds two leads whose vicious electric chemistry sparks an on-screen relationship more believable than any Vaughn-Aniston liaison announced in the tabloids. As bitter embattled exes waging all-out war theyre made for each other. Vaughns warp-speed self-pitying witticisms (who else can say ""Ill hang myself with waxed dental floss""?) are a thing of comedic beauty. And Aniston? Heave a sigh of relief for her because shes finally found her vehicle. She is hilarious and sad and steely and sympathetic all at once all persuasively all with radiant humanity. Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavenders screenplay (with help from Vaughn) nails every petty urge from jealousy to revenge but it nails the softer longings too. For a film this grim its surprisingly low on cynicism. Lesser characters enlivened by a rich supporting cast -- including Jon Favreau (in Swingers with Vaughn) as a bartender-sage Jason Bateman as a mild-mannered real estate agent and Judy Davis as a she-wolf gallery owner -- have tiny moments of wisdom and compassion that salve some of the movies rawest wounds. All of this makes for some wicked mood swings in a film being pumped as summer 2006s first marquee comic confection. It might not be the frosted lemon tart thats been advertised for months but it is solid satisfying fare -- flecked with humor grounded in pain. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Apple Sale at eBay Up to 60% off + free shipping Polo Ralph Lauren Mens Shoes for 20 + 5 samp;h Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Whos afraid of Virginia Woolf? Well not Vince Vaughn. The fast-talking wise- cracking star of ""The Break-Up"" cooked up this tale of a couple in the throes of collapse with newbies Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender who wrote the off-kilter screenplay. If 7 Up is the un-cola consider ""The Break-Up"" also starring Jennifer Aniston the un-romantic comedy. Its not that this film is as dark as Mike Nichols 1966 ""Woolf"" but boy is it as loud. At a Cubs-White Sox game at Wrigley Field Gary Grobowski (Vaughn) zeroes in on Brooke Meyers (Aniston) whos sitting in the same row. Buddy Johnny O (Jon Favreau) wears his black Sox jersey in a sea of Cubbie fans just spoiling for a fight. And the guys testy banter signals its safe for guys to slide into this movie. Of course with the slew of fella-tweaked romantic comedies - ""Wedding Crashers"" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" and ""Failure to Launch"" - out there they shouldnt have had to work so hard. How cute you find Gary and Brookes meeting depends on whether you think his dogged style is charming or stalkerlike. Often the very thing that makes Vaughn so watchable or listenable - his sharp edge blunted by banter - makes him a complicated romantic lead. As the opening credits roll its clear Gary won. They both did. Because what follows is a montage of snapshots featuring the two up until the time they bought a condo together. Geez they look sweet together almost like a real couple. But ""The Break-Up"" is bent on proving reality can bite. Two years into the relationship the unmarrieds unravel after a spat about dishes. Anyone whos been here - and havent we all? - knows thats a load of crockery. Yet once it becomes about plates or the number of lemons needed for a centerpiece or ... or ... or ... any truths will get lost in translation. Mars no hear Venus and vice versa. George and Martha had years of marriage and 86-proof fuel to ignite the bonfire of their relationship in ""Woolf."" That ""War of the Roses"" duo had put plenty of miles on their marriage before that engine blew and they began their battle. It is tougher to grasp Gary and Brookes reasons for self-immolation. Sure hes got a real gift for self-justification. The middle son in a brother-run touring company he self-medicates with video games. Her days are as long as his. Marilyn Dean (Judy Davis) the imperious gallery owner she works for trumps his older tongue-tied brother Dennis (Vincent DOnofrio) any day of the week. Brookes frustration seems reasonable until she decides on humiliation as a make-up strategy. A contest of wills ensues. Will he apologize? Will she get over it? With the help of a real estate agent-friend played by Jason Bateman (who knows arrested development when he sees it) those questions morph into one Who will move out of the condo? Of course the movies hook is will Gary and Brooke mend or forever rend their relationship? We take for granted they love each other. Though come to think of it the only evidence is in those snapshots. Each has his and her sounding boards. Cole Hauser plays younger bro Lupus whose name aptly invokes wolves and illness simultaneously. Brooke has better luck with married best friend Addie (Joey Lauren Adams). If only shed listen. Singed as it is ""The Break- Up"" wasnt intended to be a black comedy. Peyton Reed showed his talent for the buoyant with ""Down With Love."" But the director cant strike a balance. Gently bobbing the camera when Brooke and Gary verbally spar doesnt help. Along the way to emotionally extra crispy ""The Break-Up"" hits some funny notes. Some are silly like Brookes brother Richard and his male chorus the Tone Rangers. One of the best comes late and gives Vaughn and Favreau a whos-on-first routine that could turn into an instant classic. The best news isnt exactly kind That other truly hard breakup seems to have given Aniston a new heft. This is the first movie where her indie gifts mesh with studio-picture demands. Still who knew the most anticipated romantic comedy of the summer would turn out to feel like a quasi-documentary? ""The Break-Up"" doesnt come with a warning (and the PG-13 is overly generous). Perhaps it it should The makers of this film are not liable for any misunderstandings parking-lot arguments or ruined dates.

The Break-Up Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2006) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-break-up-2006,200,thebreak-up14,thebreak-up,rogerebert
"The Break-Up Split to Splat washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Break-Up Split to Splat With friends like these Vince Vaughn upstages Jennifer Aniston in their romantic comedy. (By Melissa Moseley -- Universal Studios) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 2 2006 Nobody likes a fight thats fixed except the backroom boys making the deal. Which is why ""The Break-Up"" a romantic comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston may have its share of laughs but isnt much fun . Thats because Vaughn -- also one of the films co-writers and producers -- seems to have awarded himself the championship belt before the opening bell. He gets all the laughs. And Anistons the pretty palooka who takes the fall all too early. Viewers hungry for glimmers of Anistons off-screen relationship with Vaughn -- so fresh on the heels of that Other Break-Up with Brad Pitt -- wont find more than the usual meaningful glances between any actors playing lovers. And there are no nudge-nudge wink-wink one-liners to get the audience chortling or sighing over Brangelina or Vaughniston. Vaughn plays Gary a tour guide in Chicago who charms tourists with his slightly risque jokes. His idea of a good time is shooting pool watching the Cubs on widescreen TV or firing up a video game while his live-in girlfriend Brooke (Aniston) kvetches in the background. Thanks to his hilarious turns in films such as ""Swingers"" and ""Wedding Crashers"" were conditioned to guffaw at everything he does -- cluelessness couch-potato slovenliness and all. (""Get some"" he yells clicking at the console as his favorite character blows cops into smithereens.) Theres no question whose corner were supposed to be in. Brookes a humor-impaired art dealer who has a sharp eye for fine paintings ballet and Garys domestic shortcomings. Her reactions amount to three Shes appalled thunderstruck or upset by his actions. When she weeps her face concertinas into a wet squishy mess. She seems perpetually miserable. (Aniston clearly fails the A-list actress challenge of still looking beautiful while crying -- think Meg Julia -- and instead just blubs like the rest of us.) When in the heat of an argument Gary makes a point about Michelangelos ""16th chapel"" its Brookes straight-gal job to inform him its the Sistine Chapel. Shes right but hes funny. And in comedy smart alecks lose and endearing goofballs win. Round 1 to Gary. When Brooke decides to end the relationship both parties refuse to leave the condo they bought together. So they agree to an estranged coexistence with Gary spending his nights on the pullout sofa. But even though hes lost the bedroom and is clearly heartbroken Gary remains on top. When Brooke brings in a new suitor named Mike for instance Gary persuades him to sit down for a quick game of virtual football. Mike soon forgets hes supposed to be taking Brooke out on a date. ""I cant take all the credit"" Gary says when Mike expresses admiration for his video-clicking prowess. ""I gotta thank those little digital guys with the big hearts."" Brooke reads in the background pretending not to care losing again. Aniston showed peppy spirit as Rachel Green in years of TVs ""Friends"" and she was a ticklish surprise as Joanna in ""Office Space."" But in this movie she never gets to show those comedic abilities; shes cast as a cute killjoy. When Garys beaten up by Brookes gay brother Richard (John Michael Higgins) whom he previously dismissed as a wimp Brooke snickers when Gary recounts the story. But even then she doesnt win the round; Gary loses it on his own. It takes two to tangle -- a couple evenly matched ready to fight tooth and nail. Take a speedy rewind through the best romantic matchups of the past Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy or Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal in ""When Harry Met Sally"" or Cher and Nicolas Cage in ""Moonstruck."" Its as comical to watch Crystal getting flustered as Ryan Hepburn as Tracy. Its enjoyable to wonder whos going to get the upper hand -- even as we conveniently forget the inevitable result a heartwarming tie. Because the main event in ""The Break-Up"" is such a disappointment were reduced to finding amusement in the supporting characters who are frankly the best thing about the movie. Higgins best known for his turns in ""Best in Show"" and TVs ""Arrested Development"" steals every scene he shares with Vaughn. At one point -- and to Garys horror -- he enlists an entire dinner gathering of family to accompany his a cappella rendering of the Yes song ""Owner of a Lonely Heart."" Then theres Andy (Peter Billingsley) the henpecked husband of Brookes best friend (a surprisingly muted Joey Lauren Adams) who can hardly speak without a signal from his wife. Vincent DOnofrio who plays Garys brother has one of the finest scenes of all a real tour de force as he wordlessly expresses his frustration with Gary by uncricking his neck and peculiarly using the corners of a handkerchief to clean the wax out of his ears. The routine is so off-the-wall you cant help laughing. And you know when youre chuckling at moments like this you are craving a better comedy. The Break-Up (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for profanity sexual content and some nudity.

Comments The Break-Up Vince Vaughn (who collaborated on the story) plays a Chicago tour guide whos into sports; Jennifer Anistons character works in an art gallery. The unlikely couple meet at Wrigley Field; by the time the opening credits are over theyre sharing a condo but shes ready to call it quits. This strange comedy is nothing but curveballs after that; like director Peyton Reeds previous Down With Love it has to do with real estate and the way we live. Its full of pain and quirky characters standing at oblique angles to one another and while it doesnt add up it held me throughout. With Jon Favreau Joey Lauren Adams Judy Davis Vincent DOnofrio Ann-Margret John Michael Higgins and Jason Bateman. PG-13 105 min.

Sitting through it is almost as painful as going through the demise of a relationship. To watch two unsympathetic people squabble and snarl for almost two hours is about as grating it gets. Their quarrels come in two volumes non-stop bickering and all-out screaming matches. If you have a taste for some good vengeful sparring then rent Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf? or War of the Roses. If its laughter you seek skip The Break-Up. The ads misleadingly present this as a wacky romantic comedy but its far grimmer. The romance is encapsulated during the opening credit sequence. Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) and Gary (Vince Vaughn) meet at a Cubs game. Overbearing Gary insists Brooke take a hot dog he has purchased. Then he lures her away from her date. The two fall in love and buy a condo. They throw a dinner for their families and their resentments bubble to the surface. If we had any idea what had drawn the characters together in the first place we might care what happens when they break up. But we dont. Neither character is terribly endearing. Gary a Chicago tour operator is immature and addicted to video games. Brooke who manages an art gallery is long-suffering and manipulative. Although Vaughn has some funny moments he doesnt come close to the comic heights of last summers Wedding Crashers. A few supporting characters shine however. John Michael Higgins almost steals the movie as Anistons closeted brother. His scenes warbling with his a cappella choral group -- The Tone Rangers -- are among the movies funniest. Judy Davis has some acerbically humorous moments as Brookes eccentric boss. Jason Bateman is a hoot as the real estate-agent friend who wont waive his commission on the sale of their condo. Most of the movie is about the couple digging in maliciously Gary clings to the condo while Brooke schemes to get him back by making him jealous. Its not clear why shes bothering. If you value your time and your relationship dont see this on a date.

If you go to it expecting a good movie you will also be severely disappointed.As Varietys Brian Lowry wrote ""The Break-Up"" may be ""the first last-date movie - the one you see with someone youre about to dump."" If thats your intention there can be no better choice.Its not just that this film isnt funny. Ad campaigns after all are often intentionally misleading and no one should expect a film to be just like its trailer. The problem is that this unfunny holler fest doesnt work as a serious film either. Its only reason for being apparently is as fodder for the Jennifer Aniston/Vince Vaughn tabloid rumor mill. Both give clenched one-note performances more suitable for the soaps. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Things go wrong with the movie right away. Gary (Vaughn) a bus-tour operator in Chicago spots Brooke (Aniston) an upscale art-gallery employee at a Cubs game and immediately puts the rush on her even though shes with a date. Garys motormouth come-ons are reminiscent of what Vaughn spewed to much greater comic effect in ""Wedding Crashers."" Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 What follows is a lickety-split montage detailing the upward trajectory of the relationship. They end up sharing an elegant condo - much too spiffy for their salaries but well let it pass - and right away things grind to a halt as we witness the first of an interminable series of arguments. She wants him to clean up after a dinner party and he wants to play video games.They come apart before we have had a chance to see what brought them together. Why should we care since nothing is at stake?Brooke threatens to leave and Gary calls her bluff. But because both want to remain in the condo they end up living in separate battle zones around a common area. He puts in a pool table and sleeps on the couch; she mopes in the bedroom and tries to make him jealous by bringing dates around.Of course director Peyton Reed (""Down With Love"") and screenwriters Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender conveniently avoid any nasty consequences by constantly devising ways for Brooke to avoid having sex with her suitors. And Gary seems more interested in playing poker with the guys.Why would these two be together in the first place? Shes a culture vulture and he unknowingly refers to the Sistine Chapel as the ""Sixteenth Chapel."" She has to drag him to the ballet when hed rather be beering with his buddies. Yes opposites have been known to attract. They can also repel.The filmmakers seem to be taking the position that Gary and Brooke should be together because deep down they love each other. Meanwhile we cant wait for them to do the right thing and break up. Its always a problem when the audience is way ahead of the people who made the movie. If it wasnt for some marvelous supporting turns by the likes of Judy Davis John Michael Higgins and especially Vincent DOnofrio there would be no reason to stick around at all. DOnofrio plays Garys sulky brother and as usual he gives the role a wonderfully eccentric physicality a hulky grace. Its always inspiring as well as depressing to watch a great actor give his all to tripe.There have been terrific films about breakups - try renting Ingmar Bergmans ""Scenes From a Marriage."" But I cant recall any other couples movie that so blithely avoids the most basic rudiments of what makes men and women split up.""The Break-Up"" is about relationships but it looks like it was made by people who have never been in one. Grade D+ Rated PG-13 for sexual content some nudity and language.Sex/Nudity 10 instances. of innuendo 3 instances of posterior nudity. Violence 3 scenes with violent video games. Profanity 66 instances including 27 harsh. Drugs/Alcohol/Tobacco 10 scenes with drinking 1 of smoking.

"Break-Up The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; break-up-the ) Break-Up The (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli If you have a powerful desire to see Jennifer Anistons bare butt The Break-Up is not to be missed. But if the former Mrs. Pitts posterior isnt high on your list of sights to see the film is better left to unspool in theaters unviewed. The Break-Up is like Danny DeVitos The War of the Roses but without the wit the acid and the blacker-than-black humor. In fact The Break-Up is most effective when it lumbers into the realm of melodrama which it does a few times too often for something being touted as a ""romantic comedy."" For a movie with that label theres surprisingly little romance and less comedy. There may be a laugh or two sprinkled throughout but for the most part on those occasions when the script tries to be funny the attempts are thin and awkward. More surprising however is the fact that The Break-Up doesnt try hard or often to solicit chuckles. There are times when its seriousness is almost unsettling. The film begins with the obligatory ""meet cute."" Gary (Vince Vaughn) and Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) lay eyes upon one another at Wrigley Field as the Cubs are in the process of being mauled. One opening credit sequence later they are living together - the perfect couple in the perfect relationship until one disastrous evening. There are issues and they all come pouring out in one knock-down drag-out argument. Brooke thinks Gary is a thoughtless slob who never goes anywhere with her never helps out around the house and would rather lie on the couch in his underwear playing video games than do the dishes. Gary thinks Brooke is too controlling too rigid and doesnt appreciate him. She breaks up with him but neither is willing to move out of the condo they co-own. So they stake out their territory and try to figure out ways to drive the other person off the premises. If the storyline sounds derivative of a sit-com thats because it is right down to the underdeveloped characters. In 1989 Danny DeVito directed Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner in the underrated The War of the Roses which employed a similar premise. After watching the earlier film its easy to see where The Break-Up goes wrong. It pulls its punches. It wants the audience to like the characters. It loses its edge and becomes sappy. And it includes too many scenes that dont work and seem to go on forever. (Consider for example the family dinner in which Brookes brother starts a sing-along or the tense ""game night"" when Gary cant guess Brookes Pictionary drawing.) Director Peyton Reed (Down with Love) cant figure out what he wants the film to be a comedy a romance or a drama. It ends of being a little of all three but isnt very good as any of them. The ending which was apparently re-shot offers little in the way of a conclusion or a catharsis. Like the rest of the production it doesnt know which way to lean so it stumbles down the middle. In The Good Girl Aniston proved she has the chops to handle dramatic roles. Occasionally that ability serves her in The Break-Up. The best sequences by far are those in which Aniston goes for the heartstrings. When she cries you feel for her. Vaughn on the other hand with the exception of the scenes in which he is partnered with old buddy Jon Favreau (playing - you guessed it - Garys sharp-tongued best friend) seems a little lost. His best comedic part to date was in Wedding Crashers where he played second fiddle to Owen Wilson. Thrust into the spotlight in The Break-Up his comedic abilities have diminished. Or maybe its just that the script fails him. The supporting cast is eclectic Ann-Margret Judy Davis helium-voiced Joey Lauren Adams Vincent DOnofrio Cole Hauser Jason Bateman and (drumroll) Peter Billingsley. Yes that Peter Billingsley - little Ralphie Parker (A Christmas Story) all grown up. People expecting a riotous evening from The Break-Up are going to be stunned by what ends up on the cinematic menu. Hype and expectations are likely to be the films biggest enemies because it does not deliver what the advance publicity promises. That in and of itself wouldnt be a bad thing if the movie substituted something of value. Unfortunately The Break-Up fails to satisfy on any of the many levels on which it could have succeeded. Its an uneven mess with a confused tone. The number of scenes that work are dwarfed by those that dont and some nice acting by Aniston is wasted. The Break-Up is too badly fractured to be deemed repairable.

Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston play a Chicago couple who end their relationship but keep trying to live together. There are some energized arguments even if most of them arent very funny. This is really the story of a nice girl who makes the eminently sensible decision to dump a psychotically selfish lout.

The core story is almost relentlessly unpleasant. Pics built-in curiosity about the onscreen Vince Vaughn-Jennifer Aniston pairing should quickly dissipate as word of mouth spreads. Misleadingly marketed as a boisterous comedy ""The Break-Up"" may be the first ""last-date movie"" -- the one you see with someone that youre about to dump. Sporadic rays of sunshine emanate from the broad and gifted supporting cast but the core story is almost relentlessly unpleasant like sitting through a dinner party where the host couple does nothing but bicker. Pics built-in curiosity about the onscreen Vince Vaughn-Jennifer Aniston pairing should quickly dissipate faster than one of Vaughns rat-a-tat riffs as word of mouth spreads. Ill-conceived virtually from the opening frame as a self-described ""anti-romantic comedy"" Vaughn plays Gary a Chicago tour operator who meets Brooke (Aniston) at a Cubs game. Their entire romance then unfolds in a series of pictures flashed during the opening credits so when the audience meets them theres no sense of why they connected. Instead the two are already engaged in the kind of shrill exchanges that generally persist for the rest of the film. After a disastrous dinner party where Gary refuses to help clean up Brooke dubs him an ""inconsiderate prick"" and its hard to argue. Both however are committed to keeping the posh condo that they jointly own so they continue living together even as Brooke goes on dates trying to stir jealousy in Gary who takes up residence in the living room and does little more than watch sports and play videogames. There is vulnerability in these performances but its an uncomfortable mix -- especially because the rest of the cast seems to be performing in an entirely different movie during the limited screen time afforded them. Those taking best advantage of the showcase are John Michael Higgins in an amusing turn as Brookes closeted brother Judy Davis as her eccentric art-gallery owner boss and Vaughns ""Swingers"" pal Jon Favreau as Garys loutish friend. Gamely as the others try though what transpires between the leads is painfully awkward and often not the least bit funny from her asking their couples bowling team to oust him to him erupting at her during a game of Pictionary. Nor does the comedic conceit of broken-up people cohabiting -- the central image of the movies ad campaign -- ever quite materialize despite vague echoes of ""The Odd Couple"" an inspiration cited by producer Vaughn (who also shares story credit with first-time writers Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender) in the production notes. Vaughns verbal dexterity remains impressive and he exhibits genuine pain as well as flashes of the comedy chops that arguably were the strongest element in last summers hit ""Wedding Crashers."" Helmer Peyton Reed (""Down With Love"") has clearly given his producer-star free rein to improvise but theres not much evidence of any direction and the character proves almost consistently unlikable which works against the film. As for Aniston she too delivers persuasive dramatic moments but has been so overexposed in undistinguished romantic comedies as to be ill served by showing up in another one even if its considerably darker than expected. And the movies supermarket-checkout line aspects can only go so far as a marketing hook. Pic does make reasonably good use of its Chicago locales and song score though given how obnoxious Gary is its hard to imagine his bus tour representing a major attraction. Near the end a weary Brooke concedes ""I dont know how we got here."" Its a sentiment most of the audience will doubtless share.
