Comments Youve Got Mail The medium is not the message in this old-fashioned romantic comedy (1998) about an on-line flirtation between the owner of a small bookstore (Meg Ryan) and the heir of a giant bookstore chain (Tom Hanks) who dont realize theyve met each other in the real world. His Manhattan store means to put hers out of business but the movie shamelessly uses ideas about the relationship between culture and economics mainly as structural devices making the story seem pleasantly retrograde rather than stodgy or pretentiously political. The coincidences that make the destined lovers paths cross arent contrived with much finesse but the characters get in some decidedly clever lines. Director Nora Ephron wrote the screenplay with Delia Ephron based on the 1940 movie The Shop Around the Corner.

Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. Directed by Nora Ephron. (PG. 115 minutes.) Every time ""Youve Got Mail"" is about to choke on its own cleverness its resuscitated by its extremely likable -- oh heck lets just call them lovable -- stars. The ever-perky Meg Ryan and the always reliable Tom Hanks play Kathleen and Joe New York singles having a fling on the Internet. What these two dont realize in the heat of their strictly anonymous correspondence is that they already know and fiercely dislike each other. And for good reason Kathleens childrens bookstore is on the verge of being put out of business by a big fat chain owned by Joes family. The last time Ryan and Hanks paired up in ""Sleepless in Seattle"" they had hardly any screen time together. Nora Ephron who directed both movies must have realized that she blew a chance to showcase her stars chemistry. Theyre all over each other in ""Youve Got Mail."" Much of it is verbal sparring as Kathleen accuses Joe of seeing books only as a way to make money and he counters with a defense of capitalism. Meanwhile their softer sides are revealed in cyberspace. The best scenes come toward the end when Joe courts Kathleen in real space. By this time he has caught on that she is the ""shop girl"" hes been fervently messaging. Kathleen still knows Joe only as a corporate suit but falls for him anyway. Unfortunately Ephron isnt content just to let her actors work their magic together. The script suffers from an acute case of cuteness. Ultimately ""Youve Got Mail"" bursts at the seams from having a comedy routine stuffed inside it.

MacyJulianne MooreViggo MortensenRita WilsonRobert Forster Philip Baker Hall William H. Macy Julianne Moore Viggo Mortensen Rita WilsonUniversal B Psycho (Movie - 1998) Genre Horror Mystery and Thriller; Starring Anne Heche Vince Vaughn Robert Forster Philip Baker Hall William H. Macy Julianne Moore Viggo Mortensen Rita Wilson; Director Gus Van Sant; Author Joseph Stefano; Producer (person) Brian Grazer; Producer (group) Imagine Entertainment; Release Date Wide 12/04/1998; Runtime (in minutes) 105; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Universal Posted December 18 1998 -- 1200 AM EST The possibility that Tom Hanks is the anonymous correspondent with whom you have been exchanging intimate e-mails for weeks while sitting on the couch in your sweatpants eating nonfat Haagen-Dazs out of the carton is the reason why Internet services like America Online are a multibillion-dollar phenomenon and why the romantic fabric of America today is woven with modem connections. Actually the anonymous correspondent is more likely to be Bill Maher. But its the dream of Hanks that keeps hope alive and keeps Youve Got Mail alive too. Nora Ephrons mightily unsteady ultimately seductive romantic comedy seduces in huge part because Hanks a 42-year-old Californian is so effectively endearingly light-footedly convincing as a New Yorker in his indeterminate 30s. Hes Joe Fox the attractive wealthy hard-charging owner of the kind of book-superstore chain that regularly puts small neighborhood bookshops out of business. And what Joe doesnt realize is that the anonymous woman on the other end of the blinking cursor -- the unknown online enchantress whose every thought is far more captivating than any Ephronish barb falling from the sharp tongue of his aggressive editor girlfriend (Parker Posey) -- is Kathleen Kelly the gentle owner of one of those very shops (a childrens literary Eden no less) he likes to devour. And that they live in the same adorable highly cultured Upper West Side neighborhood that Nora Ephron lives in. And that the e-mail enchantress is Meg Ryan (In real life shes more likely to be Courtney Love.) Youve Got Mail steals from the best. ""Parfumerie"" Miklos Laszlos charming 1937 story about a Budapest shop girl who doesnt realize that her lonely hearts pen pal is a fellow employee was first turned into The Shop Around the Corner (1940) one of the most irresistibly beguiling romantic comedies ever made by master beguiler Ernst Lubitsch. (The story also inspired Judy Garlands film In the Good Old Summertime and the Broadway musical She Loves Me.) Lubitsch of course cast Jimmy Stewart opposite Margaret Sullavan. So right away theres a shimmer of gold dust on Ephrons project since Hanks appealingly decent persona is so constantly compared to Stewarts. But pretty as it is Youve Got Mail also frequently veers from that great adaptation. For one thing the director collaborating with her sister Delia Ephron on the script cant resist making the story something weightier than Lubitschs gossamer romance. Addicted to social satire she digresses to comment on the culture of laptops of bookstore economics of literary cocktail chat even of attempting to pay with a credit card in the cash-only aisle of the famous foodie heaven Zabars. And with so many pauses to toss off zingers the pleasurable build-up to the satisfying clinch is thrown off-kilter; Ephron the writer is still in better shape than Ephron the director who could have used someone to tell her ""Funny But lose the scene."" We know Kathleen is meant for Joe but the entire last quarter of the movie drags while Ephron juggles her arch throwaway subplots Kathleens boyfriend (Greg Kinnear) is a vain newspaper columnist; the old bookkeeper in her shop (Jean Stapleton) once had an affair with a man who ""ran Spain""; Joes father (Dabney Coleman marvelously dry as zwieback) dates a string of young girlfriends etc. (The rest of the supporting cast -- including Dave Chappelle as a superstore executive -- is uniformly terrific.) Then theres the Sleepless in Seattle conundrum Since Hanks and Ryan first clicked so lucratively for Ephron as circling soul mates five years ago she is understandably loath to mess with the formula too much. And this doesnt leave much room for freshness. Joe may represent corporate greed but hes also after all Tom Hanks who eventually feels truly sorry about the business hardship he has caused. Kathleen may run her own independent enterprise but she is finally twinkly nose-crinklingly cute Meg Ryan who in the morning after her boyfriend goes to work takes perky-pooky baby steps in her pjs and woolly socks to read her e-mail from the most ideal fella a lonely AOL user could ever imagine. (You know shes reading because her eyes pop and she grins busily; Ryan never does anything quietly not even read to herself.) Hanks though he reads like real men read (alert but available to his dog). As Joe he writes like women can only wish men would write men who know theres more to online seduction than openers like ""What R U wearing?"" For giving millions of electronic-letter writers hope alone this valentine to modern love in New York deserves the letter B.

"Youve Got Mail (PG) Related Items Read a Post feature about AOLs product placement Play our Meg Ryan movie quiz ""Youve Got Mail"" showtimes Mail Pushing Your Buttons By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 18 1998 Net gain Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan woo each other through e-mail in ""Youve Got Mail."" (Warner Bros.) Director Nora Ephron Cast Tom Hanks; Meg Ryan; Hallee Hirsh; Dabney Coleman; David Chappelle; Greg Kinnear; Michael Palin; Parker Posey; Jean Stapleton; Steve Zahn Running Time 1 hour 56 minutes Contains a smattering of profanity As I staggered zombie-like out of a screening of ""Youve Got Mail"" an insistent voice kept sounding in my head Must . . . enroll . . . in America Online . . . now . . . I also had a strange craving for a tall non-fat decaf mochaccino. Maybe its not so strange after all. The protagonists of Nora Ephrons new romantic comedy spend so much time either logged on to their e-mail accounts or ordering designer coffee that the film feels like an extended commercial for AOL and Starbucks. In between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan somehow manage to fall in love despite circumstantial barriers that threaten to prevent them from realizing that they were made for each other. If the cast director and plot sound familiar they ought to. Its ""Sleepless in Seattle"" all over again. Except that here instead of a radio call-in show its e-mail that brings the lovers together and instead of geographic undesirability its the fact that theyre business rivals that keeps them apart. In 1993 if memory serves that winning formula went over like gangbusters and I see no reason why ""Mail"" shouldnt repeat the phenomenal success of ""Seattle."" And yet . . . and yet . . . For some reason this film made me feel like a Christmas goose being fattened for slaughter. Its force-fed diet of whimsy cloyed long before the eagerly anticipated romantic payoff arrived to put me out of my misery. Okay so misery is too strong a word. But I can only take so much adorable nose-scrunching by the adorable Ryan as she pads around her adorable apartment in her adorable little pjs. As Kathleen Kelly Ryan plays the proprietor of a quaint childrens bookstore called the Shop Around the Corner. She dreams of butterflies on the subway and dresses up in princess headgear to read aloud to her wee customers. Her cute AOL address is Shopgirl. As Joe Fox Tom Hanks plays the dapper scion of a family that runs a chain of book superstores that threaten to put Kathleens independent shop out of business. He has a fluffy golden retriever named Brinkley and gets along great with kids. His no-nonsense online tag is NY152. For several months now Shopgirl and NY152 have been conducting a computer affair sneaking virtual visits with each other behind the backs of their respective significant others (Greg Kinnear and Parker Posey). Since they have agreed not to exchange any personal information the keyboard correspondents have no idea that in reality each cannot stand the other. Well thats not entirely true. They initially hit it off when Joe accidentally meets Kathleen over the cash register of her store; the animus doesnt set in until she finds out he is a corporate greed-head. (He isnt really but she cant see past their adversarial entrepreneurial relationship.) When will these two crazy kids come to their senses and realize their love was meant to be? Professional standards prevent me from giving away the ending but I can tell you that about half-way through Joe figures out that Kathleen and Shopgirl are one and the same so a substantial portion of the films suspense dissipates early on. Just as there was nothing terribly wrong with ""Seattle"" theres nothing seriously amiss here especially if you can convince yourself that lurking in the next AOL chat room might be a Tom Hanks or a Meg Ryan and not some drooling 300-pound loser with bad skin. The script written by the director and her sister Delia is clever enough but the Ephron sisters are at their best when they are at their nastiest. Poseys tart brittle character is a joy to watch and Kathleen is most palatable when she is dissing Joe and not batting her big Bambi-eyes at him. Steve (""Out of Sight"") Zahn is funny as Kathleens slightly spaced-out employee and Jane (""Happiness"") Adams makes an amusing cameo appearance as a flirtatious TV interviewer. Nevertheless theres nothing really new or original here except that Ephrons five-year-old movie has been updated to incorporate our modern obsession with electronic communication over good old-fashioned conversation in a singles bar. E-mail may give ""Mail"" its oh-so-trendy zip but it is also its chief downfall. After all how exciting is it to stand over someones shoulder and watch him type?

The reteaming of the ""Sleepless in Seattle"" combo of costars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan and director Nora Ephron puts a fine contempo spin on the time-tested premise first used onscreen in Ernst Lubitschs ""The Shop Around the Corner."" ""Youve Got Mail"" is an attractively wrapped package expressly addressed to holiday audiences. The long-awaited reteaming of the ""Sleepless in Seattle"" combo of costars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan and director Nora Ephron puts a fine contempo spin on the time-tested premise first used onscreen in Ernst Lubitschs ""The Shop Around the Corner"" (1939) and reworked for the musical ""In the Good Old Summertime"" (1949). The story of anonymous affectionate pen pals who dislike each other in person this winning romantic comedy and great date movie will be propelled to hefty B.O. by its alluring high-powered stars and lack of other competition in this genre. In many ways new pic is the most successful version yet of this familiar premise. Originally penned as a play ""Parfumerie"" by Miklos Laszlo Samson Raphaelsons script for ""The Shop Around the Corner"" used a curio shop as the backdrop for the relationship that blossoms between feuding co-workers and secret correspondents Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan. In Robert Z. Leonards 1949 remake set in a music shop Judy Garland sparkles although she and Van Johnson lack the chemistry of the earlier duo and Leonards less subtle approach suffers without the Lubitsch touch. Hanks and Ryan meanwhile already proved their chemistry in ""Seattle"" a pic in which ironically they were rarely onscreen together. In this their third outing as co-stars (the first was the less-successful ""Joe vs. the Volcano"") they show why they are two of Hollywoods most bankable and in many ways most traditional stars. Hanks meshes the boyish charm of Jimmy Stewart with the earthy integrity of Spencer Tracy and Ryan blends Kate Hepburns determined sensibility with the infectious ebullience of a Jean Arthur turning in one of her best comic parts since the Ephron-scripted ""When Harry Met Sally."" Set in Gotham pic boasts an opening sequence that nicely demonstrates how a pair of New Yorkers can walk the very same route every day without ever connecting. As corporate heir Joe Fox (Hanks) and shop owner Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) wend their way to work on the Upper West Side they are mere footsteps -- and yet worlds -- apart. Joe is planning to open a mammoth commercial book store a la Barnes and Noble while Kathleen runs a tiny childrens bookshop dubbed in a loving nod to Lubitsch the Shop Around the Corner. While Fox Books promises a cappuccino bar snazzy architecture and sales discounts the Shop Around the Corner offers a knowledgeable caring staff intimate group reading sessions and crafts for children. Nora and Delia Ephrons script keeps some of the salient elements of the Lubitsch-Raphaelson version but adds some commendable new ones. Most pointedly the writers provide very good reasons for the friction between the two lead characters. Theres a genuine professional rivalry between Joe and Kathleen as his store threatens to put hers out of business. When Joe and Kathleen meet romantic sparks fly but when she later learns hes the mercenary entrepreneur about to steamroll her shop her appreciation of his quick-witted charm gives way to disapproval of his soulless guile. Both are involved in dull relationships she with narcissistic columnist Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear in a good turn) he with shallow editor Patricia Eden (Parker Posey sparingly used in a rare studio outing). Unwittingly however Joe and Kathleen are each others cyber soul mates. Exchanging daily e-mail under pseudonymous screen names they discuss their favorite literature (hers is ""Pride and Prejudice"") and films (his is ""The Godfather"") and share their various aspirations. Pic makes expert use of familiar Upper West Side locales that serve nicely to advance the storyline. Desperately trying to avoid Joe in the upscale grocery Zabars Kathleen reluctantly finds he is her only ally when a cashier refuses her credit card. Ephron directs this scene and others with great economy and liveliness finding welcome opportunities for her actors to use their gifts for physical as well as verbal comedy. When the cyber pals finally agree to meet Joe brings his colleague Kevin (David Chappelle) to size up his cyberpal through a cafe window. Realizing to his chagrin that she is the same woman who has publicly disparaged him Joe balks but later returns. Without revealing his online identity he fakes a chance encounter and though he tries to be pleasant they end up quibbling. This scene lifted almost directly from the two earlier versions still works mighty well. The trick then for Joe is to convince Kathleen to fall for him and subtly to undermine her unflagging adoration for her cyber friend -- or at least to convince her that he is a worthy rival for her affection. As they slowly build a friendship Hanks has great fun with these scenes and Ryan plays nicely off him realizing to her surprise that she is starting to like him a great deal. When Joe has Kathleen where he wants her he arranges for the final revelation which goes a bit too smoothly to be truly convincing. While stopping short of waxing philosophical ""Youve Got Mail"" makes a good point about the difference between public personae and private selves indicating correctly how we can be more open with people we barely know and how preconceptions and misapprehensions can endanger relationships. Its also extremely timely for the late 90s era of online dating. Tech aspects are tops and just right for the genre. John Lindleys lensing renders Gotham almost squeaky clean and positively cozy. Veteran editor Richard Marks keeps the film well-paced and fast-moving especially in sequences that alternate between Joe and Kathleen weaving them together yet pulling them apart. The soundtrack filled with well-chosen oldies and classic hits is assembled with a savvy eye toward CD sales. On the down side a good supporting cast is largely wasted in throwaway parts. Jean Stapleton Steve Zahn and Dabney Coleman are among those done a disservice by roles either underwritten or cut almost to the point of total insignificance. Macintosh computers and America Online should benefit from their product placement here as should the prominently featured Starbucks which Joe and Kathleen visit daily. Theres a deeply ironic note to that last point Starbucks of course being the coffee giant that has challenged so many little coffeehouses and reportedly pushed more than a few of them out of business.

"Youve Got Mail | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; you-ve-got-mail ) Youve Got Mail (United States 1998) A movie review by James Berardinelli Tom Hanks can act. You need look no further than this years Saving Private Ryan for proof of that. Meg Ryan can also act. For supporting evidence check out Prelude to a Kiss and Courage Under Fire. However in Nora Ephrons latest romantic comedy Youve Got Mail (an update of Ernst Lubitschs 1940 movie The Shop Around the Corner) all thats required of these two popular performers is that they effervesce. Any acting that goes on is incidental. Hanks and Ryan were hired for two reasons both are instantly likable and as proven in two previous outings (Joe Versus the Volcano and Sleepless in Seattle) they work well together. In their quest to assure that Youve Got Mail is adored by movie-goers the film makers have spared no expense. Actually Hanks is playing one of his least-agreeable recent characters. Joe Fox part owner of the Fox Books Superstore chain (a Barnes amp; Noble clone) is a cold businessman who puts the competition out of business without a second thought. As things develop Joes character follows a Scrooge-like arc. He isnt haunted by ghosts but events gradually open his eyes to the evil of his ways and he undergoes an attitude change. By the final reel Joe gives us exactly the kind of Jimmy Stewart personality we expect from someone played by Hanks. (Note Stewart essayed this part in The Shop Around the Corner opposite Margaret Sullavan.) Kathleen Kelly on the other hand is pure Meg Ryan from her chirpy pep to the tilt of her head. And can anyone cry quite like Ryan? Kathleen who owns a small childrens bookstore called The Shop Around the Corner finds herself in direct conflict with Joe whose nearby superstore is stealing all of her customers. But thats not the whole story. To this standard rivals-who-fall-for-each-other tale Ephron adds a great opening credits sequence (a view of ""cyberManhattan"") and a heavy dose of fate the element that made her Sleepless in Seattle a 125 million blockbuster. For while Joe and Kathleen are locking horns in business their on-line alter-egos (""NY152"" and ""Shopgirl"") are falling in love. The Sleepless angle is illustrated perfectly in an early scene when Joe and Kathleens physical paths criss-cross but the two dont meet (at this point they know each other via e-mail but not in person). However unlike in Sleepless (and this years Next Stop Wonderland which has a similar premise) we are given a chance to see the two romantic leads interact before the final ten minutes. Consequently Youve Got Mail is the more satisfying film. Youve Got Mail is appropriately rated PG because while Hanks and Ryan play well off of one another there are no sparks. This film is about pure old-fashioned romance unsullied by things like lust and sex. Such was the case with Sleepless in Seattle and Ephron reminded of her success with that movie (and longing to erase the sting of two failures Mixed Nuts and Michael) has elected to reproduce it here. Fortunately there are enough differences that this particular journey into the realm of romantic coincidence doesnt seem like a re-tread. And the idea that two people who exchange intimate e-mail could pass each other unknowingly on the street is inherently interesting. With all of the cyber affairs begun in chat rooms across the world it was only a matter of time before a mainstream movie used an on-line romance as a plot device. On a technical level the movie is reasonably accurate (although many of the characters e-mail sessions seem like extended advertisements for AOL). But theres still a heavy element of fantasy here. I mean how likely is it that two on-line partners are going to end up looking like Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks? Although the success of Youve Got Mail rests squarely on the shoulders of Hanks and Ryan they are given able support by a diverse cast. Greg Kinnear plays Frank Kathleens technophobe boyfriend. Former independent movie queen Parker Posey in a rare mainstream role is Patricia Joes hyperkinetic significant other (his description of her ""Patricia makes coffee nervous""). David Chappelle Dabney Coleman Steve Zahn and Jean Stapleton all have minor parts. Youve Got Mail is peppered with Ephronisms (the kind of exchanges that characterized both When Harry Met Sally and Sleepless in Seattle). In Sleepless the movie that embodied a womans fantasies was An Affair to Remember; for men it was The Dirty Dozen. Here the approach is the same but the text is different. For Kathleen Pride and Prejudice is the Bible. In Joes case The Godfather is ""the sum of all wisdom."" For the most part the script despite being predictable is smart and quirky although the final line of the film delivered by Ryan to Hanks is a miscalculation. The punctuation mark would have been there without the neon sign to point it out. Youve Got Mail has the virtue of delivering exactly whats expected from it. Its a feel-good movie that offers enough comedy and romance to warm the heart without risking a sentimental overdose. Fans of Sleepless in Seattle will almost certainly fall in love with the similar-yet-different nature of the production; only die-hard cynics will be turned off by all of the unabashed good will. If there are messages to be found here theyre that romance is still thriving in our technological era and that well-written romantic comedies starring Hanks and Ryan dont represent much of a gamble for the financing studio.
