Meredith has spiky designer heels and conservative views while Everett has a deaf gay brother with a black boyfriend. Clearly hes the winner in the PC stakes along with his entire family. Everett does little to protect Meredith from the interrogations of his aggressively liberal parents brothers and sister and as Christmas Day approaches it becomes clear theyd both be better off with someone else. Ah but who?This takes a clumsy approach to match-making assuming that a few moments of lingering eye contact is enough to establish a lifelong connection. The characterisation is also at fault the Stone family wears its liberal credentials like a badge but its hard to believe that characters such as Sybil (Diane Keaton) really believe the monologues they spout.When not preaching to the converted the film succeeds in creating a broad culture-clash comedy. Its refreshing to see a female control freak making the pratfalls Merediths nervous throat-clearing habit amuses as does the constant failure of her plans to gain the familys approval (by refusing to share a bedroom with Everett out of respect she unwittingly ousts sulky sister Amy from her room). Luke Wilson also draws easy laughs from his stoner character Ben whose fetish for uptight women couples him with Parker in some of the films funniest scenes. For all its sermonising and half-hearted romance The Family Stone is amusing enough to succeed as a festive family time-passer.

"Family Stone The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; family-stone-the ) Family Stone The (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its a tough thing for a dysfunctional-family-at-Christmas movie to avoid doses of melodrama and its fair to say that The Family Stone contains its share. But the nice thing about the movie is that it avoids overt manipulation. Theres some - its virtually impossible for a movie of this sort to generate an emotional response without any - but its kept to a minimum and doesnt come at the viewer like a sledgehammer. Instead of having to sit through a Terms of Endearment scene we are offered something more tasteful. Meeting ones prospective in-laws is always a daunting prospect but combine the following factors - youre going to meet them all at once youre not comfortable with large family gatherings and its Christmas - and you have a recipe for a really bad holiday. For Meredith Morton (Sarah Jessica Parker) this is a nightmare come to life. Meredith is a repressed buttoned down type with impeccable manners. People warm to her like they do to a glacier. She has accompanied her boyfriend Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) home for the holidays. In addition to introducing her to his family hes thinking of proposing marriage. The Stone family reacts to Merediths arrival like a pack of wolves and they pounce with fangs bared. The worst of the lot is Everetts youngest sister Amy (Rachel McAdams) who has a barbed comment for every occasion. Sybil (Diane Keaton) Everetts mother isnt much better - she instantly recognizes that Meredith isnt right for her son. Everetts dad Kelly (Craig T. Nelson); deaf brother Thad (Tyrone Giordano); and pregnant sister Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser) take a wait-and-see approach. Only Ben (Luke Wilson) the black sheep of the Stone clan seems willing to cut Meredith a break. After less than a day with the Stones the frazzled outsider feeling the pressure checks out of the house and into a nearby inn. She also calls in reinforcements in the person of her sister Julie (Claire Danes). What proceeds to complicate matters is that Everett finds himself attracted to Julie while Ben and Meredith discover a connection when they attempt to fly her ""freak flag."" I have seen The Family Stone categorized in some places as a ""screwball comedy"" but this is an inappropriate label. There are a few mildly comedic moments sprinkled throughout the production but this belongs in the drama category. Laughter although it may occur (and hopefully in all the right places) is not the primary goal of writer/director Thomas Bezucha. He wants The Family Stone to touch a deeper chord. For the most part he succeeds. Theres nothing extraordinary or groundbreaking about the film but it understands what its doing and does it effectively. The key for a movie like this is getting the characters to seem more like people than caricatures and Bezucha acoomplishes that. The film comes with an epilogue and it is needed because not all the subplots can be wrapped up in the three-day span that restricts the primary action. This five-minute sequence which offers closure to almost everything has an underlying sense of poignancy that the director could have mishandled. The atmosphere is ripe for manipulation of the kind that will ensure theres not a dry eye in the house. But Bezucha is restrained. Hes smart recognizing that we dont need violins to feel the undercurrent. The talented cast helps. Sarah Jessica Parker finding that there is life after Sex in the City has no difficulty with Merediths arc. Of all the characters in the movie she undergoes the biggest transformation and Parker aces it. Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson settle comfortably into the matriarch/patriarch roles and there is one especially touching scene between the two of them. Luke Wilson brings his special brand of relaxed ""dont worry be happy"" performance to the proceedings. Rachel McAdams 2005s ""it"" girl (see also Wedding Crashers and Red Eye) imparts a dose of charisma. Claire Danes on the comeback trail is appealing. And Dermot Mulroney needs little more to get by than his good looks. Its worth mentioning that this is the best adult holiday film in a while. (Of course competition has been thin - Christmas with the Kranks Surviving Christmas etc.) The box office life of The Family Stone will be short. The movie is so drenched in Christmas spirit that it will seem a little stale once the holidays are past. Even taking this into consideration its worth two hours for those who appreciate this kind of workmanlike low-risk drama.

Afraid so. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""The Family Stone"" with Claire Danes Diane Keaton Rachel McAdams Dermot Mulroney Craig T. Nelson Sarah Jessica Parker Luke Wilson. Written and directed by Thomas Bezucha. 102 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some sexual content including dialogue and drug references. Several theaters. If every family was as warm and accepting and loving as the Stones in Thomas Bezuchas ""The Family Stone"" nobody would need holiday movies. Based in a beautifully decorated New England home and headed by a snugly sweatered Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson the Stones are a dream family serving up picture-perfect holiday meals and surrounding their members with unconditional love. That is until one of them brings home a new girlfriend for Christmas and nearly every Stone family member immediately decides that they hate her. This girlfriend it should be noted is played by Sarah Jessica Parker a performer of such charm that the movie is immediately thrown into some sort of strange bizarro-world. Who could hate Parker even when she has her hair in a bun (which in this movies shorthand conveys ""uptight"" just as a Stone sisters NPR tote bag conveys ""free-spirited"") talks on a cellphone a lot and keeps putting her nicely stilettoed foot in her mouth? Her character Meredith is actually rather sweet Shes trying hard to make a good impression and failing miserably. Desperate for support Meredith calls her sister Julie (Claire Danes) to come join her for the holiday and then things get even more surreal. Everett (Dermot Mulroney) the eldest Stone son is on the verge of proposing to Meredith -- until he picks Julie up at the bus stop and realizes that he kinda likes her too. (Julie you see has long flowing blond hair an angelic smile and no apparent cellphone.) Conveniently stoner Stone son Ben (Luke Wilson) sees something in Meredith that nobody else seems to see. Meanwhile almost as an afterthought somebody has cancer. Bezucha whose previous film was the 2000 gay romance ""Big Eden"" has crafted a fairly outrageous plot and hasnt added enough wit to make it palatable. (The films occasional random pratfalls seem a desperation tactic.) And too many of the characters are flat Younger sister Amy (Rachel McAdams) is annoyingly bitchy; gay brother Thad (Tyrone Giordano) is saintly; married sister Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser) has no personality at all. You wonder if shes got some secret plotline perhaps involving her absent husband but he shows up belatedly at the end as if Bezucha suddenly remembered his existence. Things eventually get sorted out more or less and ""The Family Stone"" leaves us with some heartwarming thoughts about family love and holiday tradition. Some will find it touching some will be too weary of the plot contrivances and the smug Stone family to care. For me the movies only moment of genuine emotion came from another movie as the Stone television shows us Judy Garland singing that minor-key holiday classic ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" A Stone sister is curled up cozily on the couch watching ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" -- which seems now that I think of it a far better idea than watching this movie.

Starring Sarah Jessica Parker Diane Keaton. Dermot Mulroney Luke Wilson and Rachel McAdams. Directed by Thomas Bezucha. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) This is just a guess but from clues on the soundtrack -- where the music gets sentimental raucous or whimsical -- it seems that writer-director Thomas Bezucha was trying to make a certain kind of holiday comedy with ""The Family Stone."" Something heartwarming about a zany but lovable family. Something with a touch of romance too and a respect for the mysteries of love sex and attraction the sparks by which families come into being after all. Instead he made something perverse a feel-bad holiday film about a repellent family with a milquetoast dad and a smug devious harpy of a mom. He has created a story about a creepy clan that closes ranks when the eldest sibling brings his girlfriend home for the holidays. As if we needed a demonstration Bezucha has made a movie that shows that even awful people celebrate Christmas. It makes for an odd experience. Bezucha could have characterized the Stones in extreme terms from the beginning in ways that might have signaled comedy as was done with the family in ""Meet the Parents."" Instead he draws them realistically and lets them emerge as repugnant people. Before the new girlfriend Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) even arrives the mean-spirited youngest daughter (Rachel McAdams) is gossiping about her. It takes nothing to turn the family against Meredith because the family -- in particular the smiling malicious mother Sybil (Diane Keaton) -- has a major mean streak. Meredith gets the freeze the minute she walks through the door. Perhaps it was a mistake to cast such a ragingly likable actress as Parker as Meredith. The movie establishes her as stiff and self-conscious a slight prig with a tendency to stick her foot in her mouth. But as played by Parker theres nothing in her manner to suggest someone who couldnt be loosened up by a little kindness. Perceptive intelligent people could easily recognize that and the Stones are not presented as stupid. My guess only a guess is that from Bezuchas point of view neither Meredith nor the family is at fault; its just a case of oil and water. But from the audiences view Meredith is the victim. That direction could have proved fruitful making ""The Family Stone"" into the anti-holiday movie something to suck in audiences with the expectation of the usual warm emotions only to do a reversal by characterizing the family -- and by extension all families -- as a vicious tribe all sour emotions and backbiting. But thats not where the movie goes. It goes in the direction of sentiment and wistfulness of eyes brimming with tears as the snowflakes come down and people choke up remembering past Christmases. What movie do these characters think theyre in anyway? Keaton is riveting. Its possible she believed she was playing a nice person but what we get is someone who has learned to mask her hostility through a veneer of fake smiles and high-spirits. Mom is the prototype of someone whos angry but doesnt know it who mistakes her progressive politics for personal virtue and her murderous aggression for forthright honesty. The scenes between her and her children are fascinating in that Bezucha the director seems unaware of the brutality of the mothers emotional manipulation which he reveals in his screenplay. This is one of those bad movies that are almost better bad than they ever could have been if successful. At least this way its weird and different. The actors more than survive. Luke Wilson as the easygoing slacker Stone is relaxed and appealing. McAdams as the horrible daughter shows the authority of a star which she soon will be. Parker is lovely and funny and Dermot Mulroney as the eldest son ... well he should have played Johnny Cash instead of Joaquin Phoenix. He has the lived-in face the low voice the dark good looks and the magnetism. Why is it up to me to notice these things? Arent there casting directors in Hollywood? Do I have to tell these people everything? I know. By now weve deftly veered off the subject of ""The Family Stone."" But really thats a good thing. -- Advisory Sexual situations and sex banter.

And though even the beguiled may feel manipulated the next morning (or when hitting the exits) the players put it over by a nose. Happy holidays. Sarah Jessica Parker far left meets Dermot Mulroneys family Craig T. Nelson Diane Keaton and Rachel McAdams in The Family Stone. 20th Century Fox Plunked from an intended earlier opening date into todays warm and fuzzy mid-December slot (a sign of studio confidence) this is the seasonal family comedy that emerges at the end of every year the kind thats safe for Grandma. You sense this in the coming attractions when an uptight Sarah Jessica Parker falls in some kitchen-floor goop. Primitive chuckle anyone? (Related video Watch a clip from The Family Stone) About the movie The Family Stone    (out of four) Stars Claire Danes Diane Keaton Rachel McAdams Dermot Mulroney Craig T. Nelson Sarah Jessica Parker Luke Wilson Director Thomas Bezucha Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for some sexual content including dialogue and drug references Running time 1 hour 42 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Of course you wouldnt know from the same ads that fatal illness is a key plot component that one of the familys five siblings is deaf and gay and wants to adopt or that a seemingly straight-arrow dad likes funny stuff in his brownies. You can argue over whether these issues add depth to or distract from the more conventionally comic romantic entanglements that are the source of some solid laughs. But this is one busy wannabe heart-tugger. The scorecard and you need one goes like this. Dermot Mulroney (his best performance ever) is an overachieving elder son in a miscast courtship with neurotically edgy Parker (never better). Younger sisters are married and pregnant Elizabeth Reaser and snooty cutie Rachel McAdams. Brothers are hearing-impaired Ty Giordano and a frequently stoned what-me-worry-ish Luke Wilson (never better). Welcoming all to their New England home are their somewhat unconventional parents Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson. But daughter McAdams (the one sibling who has already met Parker) is aggressively rude to Mulroneys not-quite fiance. Whereupon Wilson rather inexplicably starts to see something beneath Parkers pitifully gauche facade. Whereupon Parkers more composed silky-haired sis (Claire Danes) shows up and Mulroneys eye starts to wander. You could compose an entire movie (or maybe a poem) about being a young single guy and having Danes show up for Christmas unexpectedly. This one shoots out in myriad but mostly entertaining directions depending on that old movie standby that has an element of truth. If you want to unfreeze a Parker-like prig pump her with booze and some Maxine Nightingale at a neighborhood bar. Though mostly untested writer/director Thomas Bezucha lays it on mighty thick at times he is obviously gifted with actors. The same studio Fox has another family comedy opening next week the predictably phony and phoned-in Cheaper by the Dozen 2. At least this holiday entertainment shows a little heart even if its flashing in neon on its sleeve.

"Blood from Stones. Slate Sign In Sign Up Blood from Stones. Blood from Stones. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateReel TimeRunning thoughts on movies and their makings.Dec. 16 2005 347 PM Blood From Stones Riches in The Family Stone and  wretchedness in The Producers. By David Edelstein The Family Stone yields a holiday gem The Family Stone (20th Century Fox) directed and written by Thomas Bezucha is a very heavy-handed home-for-the-holidays romantic sitcom with cancer thrown into the mix--which makes it both a would-be crowd-pleaser and a wriggling hunk of Oscar bait. There are cringe-worthy passages and an overly sentimental structure (everyone pairs up so very tidily) but the performances are delightful and the picture comes together. Advertisement The liberal sturdy nurturing Stone parents Kelly (Craig T. Nelson) and Sybil (Diane Keaton) have five children and all things considered theyve turned out handsomely. Everyone signs lovingly in the presence of the deaf son Thad (played by the deaf actor Tyrone Giordano) and the family has nothing but affection for his African-American husband Patrick (Brian J. White). Although forlorn in the absence of her traveling-on-business spouse the very pregnant Susanna (Elizabeth Reaser) has a spunky daughter (Savannah Stehlin) to keep her spirits up. Amy (Rachel McAdams) is a tad sardonic but an attractive presence. Ben is a bit of a rover--but hes played by Luke Wilson so hes sensitive and well Luke Wilson. So wheres the conflict? Its the new girl. Everett (Dermot Mulroney) has arrived with a brittle stuck-up illiberal and overly ambitious fiancee Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker); and despite the familys assurances that they like her very much they dont like her a bit--especially when she wrecks Christmas Eve dinner by suggesting that a gay child (as opposed to a ""normal"" one) might be something that a parent wouldnt wholeheartedly welcome (because you know its such a tough life). Happily an ethereally beautiful alternative to Meredith arrives in the form of Merediths do-gooder sister (Claire Danes never more ravishing). Despite the destabilizing shrew--who is nevertheless endearing in her insecurity--The Family Stone depicts a fundamentally healthy ecosystem. In fact its the most idealized family imaginable. I mean where do I sign up? I dont buy them but theres a part of me that wants to--and thinks a movie like this gives us all something to emulate. The brisk dialogue and the actors who deliver it usher The Family Stone into the realm of real. Sarah Jessica Parker-haters will be awed by the bang-up job she does as the highest of high-strung fiancees that populate these sorts of movies--and her big drunk scene in which her inhibitions explode explodes whatever inhibitions we might have about her. Nelson and Keaton have a gentle and comfortable rapport--unusual for Keaton whos usually the high-strung one in a movie. This is the latest in a long line of stupendous Keaton performances. Her Sybil is an unusual but irresistible combination of warmth and tartness of the determinedly upbeat and the haunted. She is not ""the mother."" Shes a woman with strong maternal feelings who nonetheless has to work at the job--i.e. a real person. At long last--a failure There are no real people in The Producers (Universal)--only actors laboring to dispel whatever magic they once were thought to possess. The director Susan Stroman has brought the Broadway smash to the screen (where it began almost 40 years ago) with cataclysmic results. The stage performances havent been scaled down Everything is pitched to the second balcony. And Mel Brooks material--especially the retro queeny stereotypes--is excruciatingly dated. On stage Nathan Lane gets by on hamminess and good timing but on screen theres no subtext nothing in reserve Hes more one-dimensional than the average cartoon character. Broderick in the footsteps of the peerless Gene Wilder pops his eyes and speaks in a strangled voice thats completely artificial. If this were the only thing Id seen him do Id conclude he was wholly without talent. Uma Thurman sings well and slinks better but the songs are short on melody and the role is a bimbonic disgrace. The only time I laughed was when an actor auditioning for the role of Hitler said ""I was in No No Nietzsche and Lane said ""You were Nietzsche?"" and the actor said ""No no."" Amid the shrillness second-rate vaudeville patter lands on the ear like Shakespeare. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

"A Christmas gift - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Tears A Christmas giftmovies - review`The Family Stone is just what the holiday needs -- laughs romance and a tear or twoDecember 16 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticWe need a little Christmas. Right this very minute.And we dont need the Fockers or Tim Allen to take us to that funny familiar emotional movie Christmas that weve wanted from Hollywood ever since Its a Wonderful Life introduced an angel named Clarence.The Family Stone is a holiday hybrid a romantic tragi-comedy with a little bit of everything including politics. It is Blue State sophistication meets Red State sentiment. And if it goes down like that last bite of inedible fruitcake thats by design.Sarah Jessica Parker is Meredith a high-powered and high-maintenance conservative whom Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) wants to bring home to Mom (Diane Keaton).Meredith is uptight. Meredith is nervous. Meredith is a bit tactless and politically incorrect.And Mom may not approve.Sister Amy (Rachel McAdams) the girl with the NPR totebag leaves no doubt.""I hate her""She tries to rally opposition to this Harriet Miers in their midst. Dad (Craig T. Nelson) is patient and on the fence. Gay deaf brother Thad (Ty Giordano) and pregnant sister Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser) are leaning Amys way.Only pothead documentary editor Ben (Luke Wilson) is inclined to cut the new woman some slack.Meredith tries but fails to win them over. She tries harder but fails worse. The cracks start to show in her relationship with Everett who was about to propose.So she calls in the cavalry her adorable not-uptight tolerant younger sister (Claire Danes) a woman who is everything she is not.Writer-director Thomas Bezucha juggles huge heartfelt laughs with big heart-won tears. Hes in Pieces of April territory with holiday stress family squabbles terminal illness and a Christmas present so perfect that it will just break your heart.The juggling is a bit neater than in real life but the actors make it messy. Parker is a coiled spring of nervousness and resentment; Mulroney manages nicely with his latest beau-next-door role. Wilson has never been this charming on the screen.""Youve got a freak flag"" he tells Meredith as if hes the only guy in this house who ""gets"" her. ""You just never fly it.""Danes is radiant. And Keaton and Nelson have the movies best moments usually tucked in the middle of some painfully awkward family dispute. Keatons is the first face we see quiet in repose comfortable with herself and how her family has turned out.The Family Stone argues with passion and with sign language. They casually translate their conversations even the heated ones so that the deaf son can join in. Theyre judgmental but they have a stake in who ends up with whom and how they will carry on.And theres this weight of knowledge that some of them carry and some of them carry on without.Its movie comfort food -- a few good laughs a few winks of recognition a few tears. You may not want to marry into it yourself but this Family Stone is a family that works.

Christmas cant be that bad can it? Turns out its not in The Family Stone where an outsider not the Christmas crunch sparks friction during a reunion. Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) is the prim tightly wound girlfriend of dutiful oldest son Everett (Dermot Mulroney). When he brings her home to meet his family all through the house not a creature is purring. They loathe her. For good reason. Meredith fumbles and intrudes and tries too hard to please. When Mom (Diane Keaton) suspects her son may propose things get stickier. The ensuing dramedy balances heart and humor with generous holiday wish-fulfillment. It plays almost like Terms of Endearment crossed with the feel-good yule romance Love Actually. Director-screenwriter Thomas Bezucha deflects cloying sentiment with wit and eccentricity touching your funny bone as often as your heart. The cast couldnt be much better but the script could be. By juggling so many characters Bezucha drops a few and even prominent ones succumb to contrivance with absurdly quick shifts in allegiance. Yet many will recognize larger truths in the Stone familys quirky comfy closeness which plays as if characters really have known each other all their lives. A diverse group theyre still as tight as a large family can be and they share a liberal tolerance -- except toward Meredith. Her eventful stay ultimately includes her younger more-charming sister (Claire Danes). And when Everetts laid-back slacker brother (Luke Wilson) tries to help Meredith loosen up the snow hits the fan. A strong but neglected character is Everetts other brother Thad (Tyrone Giordano) who arrives with his longtime gay partner (Brian J. White). Thad is deaf and the family often speaks both orally and in sign language a welcome layer of added expressiveness. Especially good at it is Rachel McAdams who has moments as the younger sister with too much tude. Parker plays the woman out without slipping into caricature. Meredith may be a pain but for all her fidgets and meltdowns shes only human and she only wants to be loved. Thats what The Family Stone serves most big juicy helpings of holiday mush buoyed by picture-postcard beauty and a nostalgic 70s score. Its lack of mean-spiritedness also is refreshing. The Family Stone may not be your cup of eggnog but clearly it means well. No one owns the large ensemble but Keaton comes close as the protectively feisty mama for whom this reunion means everything. Craig T. Nelson is sweetly grounded as the supportive husband who knows his place as one more soul within his wifes glowing embrace. By all means Everett should lead his own life and marry whomever he wants. But as he doubtless learned years ago Mom tends to know best. Thats because her heart more than anyones doesnt lie. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals 4-Panel Abstract Wall Art by Jon Allen for 145 + free shipping Defiant LED Flashlight 3-Pack for 10 + pickup at Home Depot ThinkGeek Summer Clearance Sale Up to 65% off + free shipping...

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""The Family Stone"" creeps up on the audience. Were sitting there thinking Ah another shameless attempt at a holiday tear-jerker. What an irritatingly insular family. What a cliched role - as the uptight city girl - they crammed Sarah Jessica Parker into. Suddenly were wiping away tears glancing around to make sure no one noticed we had fallen for this steaming cup of melodrama. The ending hits with a quiet moving beauty and symmetry. Those smug family members seem like friends. That big Massachusetts house feels like a great place to be at Christmas. And performances start to shine through the emotional blur. Diane Keaton is mean and judgmental and we like her more than ever. Craig T. Nelson sheds his Eternal Coach and plays the warmest most accepting grandfather you could ever wish for. Dermot Mulroney finally gets a good role. Tyrone Giordano and Brian White play a gay couple with an easy grace. In other words ""The Family Stone"" is a pretty darned good shameless holiday tear-jerker. The Scrooge in me hates it when that happens. Writer-director Thomas Bezucha sets us up for these double-takes with his perfect Currier amp; Ives opening. Through the snowy woods the adult children of the Stone family make their way to the big white house with the porch and the evergreens and the bottomless pot of coffee. Gay son Thad (Giordano) and partner Patrick (White) are the family favorites. Bratty college student Amy (Rachel McAdams) insults everyone. Pregnant Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser) mends quarrels. Pothead Ben (Luke Wilson) mellows out. Prodigal son Everett (Mulroney) brings home his fiancee the prickly Meredith (Parker). Madcap family high jinks ensue but theres an edge to all of it. Everyone is just a bit too mean to poor nervous Meredith; the Stone family prides itself on tolerance but a self-absorbed Manhattan girl is apparently the one affront they cant accept. Bezucha wants to explore family cliches but sometimes he uses a few too many movie conventions to escape the culture hes critiquing. Parkers character is too shallow to draw all our sympathy - she immediately starts shouting all conversation at the Stone brother who is deaf one of the dumbest movie canards ever employed. When its time for her character to change it takes only a few beers at the local bar to loosen her up. But Bezuch had some good ideas in mind that make for key turning points. Meredith gives the family a gift that hits home and theyre all stunned. She also initiates a terribly uncomfortable dinner-table conversation about whether parents would want their children to be gay if they had a choice in the matter. She mangles her delivery and it becomes a squirming mess that seems painfully real. The revelation of ""The Family Stone"" comes when it ends. Much as we might have resisted the characters or doubted their situations Bezucha has made us care. Its a nice trick and a welcome gift for the season.

"Family comes with a liberal dose of laughs - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Family comes with a liberal dose of laughs By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  December 16 2005 In The Family Stone"" Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) brings someone new home for the holidays. Shes not a he. (The Stones already have a gay son who by the way they adore.) And shes not black. (Been there doing that The gay sons partner.) Shes Sarah Jessica Parker playing an uptight white businesswoman named Meredith.The Stones happen to be one of those upper-middle-class New England clans whose temperament runs toward the bohemian. So naturally Diane Keaton is the matriarch Sybil Stone. Those of you expecting Peter Fonda as dad will have to settle for a perfectly nice Craig T. Nelson as her large puppy of a husband.The movie is a holiday romantic comedy that wants to put the holiday romantic comedy out of business. Somebody is gravely (and secretly) sick. Food crashes to the floor. And the wrong people are in love. Yet the sweetness is doled out with a pint of vinegar so the whole experience is not unlike one of those Hallmark Shoebox Greetings cards Sarcasm leaking from the heart.The problem is that no one in this liberal nest of turtleneck-wearing idealists thinks Meredith is right for Everett. She cant hug. Her demeanor runs conservative. She yells when she speaks to Thad (Tyrone Giordano) the gay hearing-impaired son. And she doesnt handle the withering contempt of Amy Stone (Rachel McAdams) nor the flirting from Ben (Luke Wilson) the slacker-stoner Stone. Desperate for moral support she calls in her more agreeable little sister Julie (Claire Danes) to be at her side for the holiday. To Merediths consternation Julie fits in immediately.The first half of The Family Stone"" is several movies happening at once and theyre all simultaneously overwritten and not fleshed out enough. Writer-director Thomas Bezucha is often less a filmmaker and more a shepherd of pratfalls. Youre no one in this movie unless you topple over. (This is his second film; his first was a wonderfully corny little romantic comedy called Big Eden"" which came out in 2000.)Nonetheless most of the cast knows how to navigate the chaos. McAdams is an actress I like more with every movie. Shes smart and sly. And Keaton knows how to finesse the movies drama and comedy -- even though she spends the movie wildly overdressed and her hair has a terrible white streak in the front.But a few of the actors never come around. As the movie goes on Parker turns luminously alive drunk and high with the engaging Wilson. Yet Mulroney mumbles to Danes until her otherwise natural performance is locked up in the halting mannerisms of Shopgirl.""Its to Mulroneys disadvantage that we find out almost too late why Everett so desperately wants his mother to give him a family heirloom to slip on Merediths finger. His thinking suggests a psychologically richer movie.Instead The Family Stone"" continues to beat up on poor Meredith whose crime is that shes too much like Martha Stewart for this household. Shes also required to be a little bit bigoted to Thad and his boyfriend Patrick (Bryan J. White). The price they pay for not being mincing queens is that they have to be billboards for tolerance We love our deaf gay son and his black boyfriend who are about to have a baby Why cant you?The urge to be progressive and politically correct short-circuits The Family Stone.""

"The Many Sins of Casting the First Stone washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Many Sins of Casting the First Stone ""The Family Stone"" with Craig T. Nelson left as the father and Sarah Jessica Parker center as the sons new fiancee is a festival of bad casting decisions. (By Zade Rosenthal -- Twentieth Century Fox Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 16 2005 On the subject of families Tolstoy famously said essentially that all happy families are the same but all unhappy families are different. Now take the Stones -- please take the Stones Braying self-righteous predictable morally superior and worst of all loud they are the subject of a film called ""The Family Stone"" that means to celebrate them but only denigrates. You wouldnt wish them on your worst enemy though of course heh heh I would. Mysteriously prosperous (no reason given) they live the good life in a generic Northeastern suburb where their seeming preoccupation is to notify strangers of their own superiority and the strangers inferiority. What they have done to earn this exalted status is never quite specified but it must have been pretty great. Youd think they cured cancer from the way they carry on though as the movie progresses it proves -- inevitably -- that there isnt yet a cure for cancer only a temporary accommodation. In any event the ordeal that unites them in scorn and smugness this Christmas season is the arrival of favorite and most successful son Everett (Dermot Mulroney) with his soon-to-be fiancee Meredith (Sarah Jessica Parker) and poor Meredith just isnt up to Stone snuff as everybody knows. One look at her tight constricted hair-in-a-bun her perfect girl makeup her prim twitchy body language her need to succeed and her willingness to be the bad guy in a workplace situation and we know Shes an emissary from the empire of repression. That makes her a mortal enemy of the wonderful Stones who stand for freedom tolerance nurture humanity compassion and of course hate the guts of anybody who dares disagree with them. Poor Meredith Its sure as rain and taxes shes gonna get a Christmas turkey in the lap at the dinner table but the movie has a big surprise for her and us -- it isnt a turkey that writer-director Thomas Bezuchas script contrives to dump on her oh no. Its an egg casserole. Well there are many ways to define the shrieking awfulness of ""The Family Stone"" from the general lack of wit to the cheap exploitation of cancer to the casual cruelty that Bezucha thinks is humanity that undergirds it but lets find another approach the casting. Casting -- the art of finding the right person to play the right part -- is one of the secret skills of the old movies. The studios knew this had specialists and thats why so many old films have a magic the newer ones lack. It really goes awry here This film is a festival of bad casting decisions. As mre and pre of the Stone clan Diane Keaton and Craig T. Nelson are completely wrong. This is nothing against either performer or really against either performance though they do seem to be in different movies Keaton possibly a biopic on the late Susan Sontag for shes suddenly acquired that white flare in the crest of her hair. No its a question of the secret principles of showbiz appropriateness Keaton is a true movie star with a pedigree that goes back of course to ""Reds"" ""Annie Hall"" and ""The Godfather."" She is royalty and protocol demands that any movie shes in -- her last one found her opposite Jack Nicholson -- acknowledge such or it feels wrong. Nelson is a TV guy. You cannot marry a movie queen to a TV guy. You cannot marry Charlize Theron and Kiefer Sutherland. When Sutherland was making movies you could; now you simply cannot Again this is nothing against Nelson but hes just so far out of his weight class so overmatched the miscalculation throws the on-screen chemistry off. You just sit there thinking Hmmm what is wrong with this picture? Then theres Mulroney as Everett. Hes 42 in real life and way too old for this role. Hes so far beyond juvenile its almost embarrassing to see him in the role of a fellow who brings a gal home for his familys approval. You think Grow up tool. You dont need anybodys permission to marry the person you love. Hes also got the wrong kind of face for the sensitive expressive Stone clan the compleat perfect liberal family He has harsh tough street-boy features a kind of pugnacity to him. As hes aged and picked up character lines he could play a cop a crook a cowboy even a lawyer. But not a Stone. Maybe a Rolling Stone but not one of these Stones. Then in the movies switcheroo he ends up with an even younger person an actress (I labor to preserve the twist ending) whose ultimate union with him seems perverse like Woody Allen ending up with a teenager or Jerry Lee Lewis with his 14-year-old cousin. Then theres Tyrone Giordano as brother Thad who happens to be not merely gay but also deaf so that the family in toto has mastered sign language as a token of their fabulous compassion; Thads black lover is a constant presence. Excuse me but the movie which gives itself a great deal of credit for its political correctness on this issue and considers itself a document of tolerance is quite the opposite It trivializes Thad by dumping so many issues on him so that theres no room whatsoever for a character. Hes the least well realized of the three boys and Giordano is fey and unprepossessing a straight cliche of gayness that even the movies admirers will find difficult to stomach. Rachel McAdams is Amy the angry daughter who is particularly snarky to the unfortunate Meredith. Shes so impossibly pretty that youre disconcerted by her bitchiness and wonder what the point is. Well there is no point. Finally Luke Wilson is the laid-back third brother who looked like trouble to me from the get-go. Hes a ""documentary filmmaker"" in California which generally means ""unemployed layabout"" and I kept awaiting the arrival of the FBI to haul him off but of course the Stones are too perfect for all that. As for poor beloved Sarah Jessica shes again wrong for the part adorable as she is. Shes too adorable. You cringe at her humiliation. An actress with an edge of ego and intractability would have worked much better. Agh the whole thing gave me the willies. Other than its smugness its pomposity and its shallowness I liked ""The Family Stone"" a lot. Except of course for the cast the script and the fact that everybody drove a Volvo. The Family Stone (102 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for drug references and sexual content.

Delayed from a November opening producer Michael Londons ""Sideways"" follow-up reps a classy holiday release for Fox that should connect with auds of all ages. The culture clash between a high-strung New Yorker and her boyfriends free-spirited kin yields a smart tart but mildly undercooked Christmas pudding in ""The Family Stone."" Writer-director Thomas Bezuchas lovingly mounted ensembler has many heartfelt moments and a keen ear for the rhythms of domestic life which make the neatly gift-wrapped outcome somewhat disappointing. Delayed from a November opening producer Michael Londons ""Sideways"" follow-up reps a classy holiday release for Fox that should connect with auds of all ages though Sarah Jessica Parkers distractingly out-of-sync performance will likely spur mixed reactions. From its postcard-worthy opening credits featuring wintry snapshots of a New England country house set to the tune of ""Let It Snow"" pic frames itself as a homage to that quintessential movie about family holidays and the inevitability of change ""Meet Me in St. Louis."" But where Vincente Minnellis 1944 classic spent a whole year with the family Smith allowing for a beautifully rounded portrait of their resilience in the face of everyday crises ""Stone"" which unspools over one dizzyingly hectic holiday reps a comparatively ungainly blend of screwball comedy romantic drama and Lifetime weepie. That it plays as well as it does is no small testament to Bezuchas palpable love for his characters. The one character arguably exempt from that embrace is Meredith Morton (Parker) a chronically uptight Gotham career woman who dreads the prospect of spending Christmas with boyfriend Everett Stone (Dermot Mulroney) and his family. The Stones are her polar opposites -- a loose slightly wacky bohemian clan thoroughly accepting of their own quirks but less tolerant of others. The most critical of the bunch is Everetts mom Sybil (Diane Keaton) a cheerfully outsized personality whose hairstyle suggests a more matronly Susan Sontag. Sybil and husband Kelly (a terrific Craig T. Nelson) have four other kids gentle Susannah (Elizabeth Reaser) married and pregnant with her second child; Ben (Luke Wilson) a droll slacker who dwells comfortably in Everetts shadow; prickly tomboyish Amy (Rachel McAdams); and Thad (Ty Giordano) who is gay deaf and completely lovable and whose partner Patrick (Brian White) is also staying for the holidays. From the moment she walks in the door Merediths stiff dont-touch-me posture and her habit of saying the wrong thing cause her to be ostracized. Amy lays a series of surprisingly cruel psychological traps that drive Meredith to the local inn while Sybil refuses to give Everett her blessing -- or his grandmothers ring the other ""stone"" of the title -- when he announces his intention to propose to Meredith. ""What I dont understand is what he sees in her"" Kelly wonders and neither Meredith nor the script provides an answer. Merediths more offensive faux pas border on social retardation and feel out of place coming from a sophisticated Manhattanite. By contrast the Stones for all their eccentricities essentially can do no wrong and if they sometimes feel a bit too good to be true theyre pleasurable company regardless. Bezucha tosses the viewer into every conversation headfirst deploying a rough at times disorienting visual style that works in rhythm with the layers of overlapping dialogue to deliver a pleasingly antic semi-improvisational feel. Helmer also knows exactly when laughter should give way to a lump in the throat handling an especially sensitive plot point -- which might have landed the film in perilous ""Stepmom"" territory -- with considerable tact. But while individual scenes have an authentically off-the-cuff feel the narrative structure as a whole feels a tad schematic never more so than when Merediths sib Julie (Claire Danes) drops by the house at her sisters request. Young beautiful and artistically inclined Julie charms the socks off the Stones initiating a string of confrontations and switcheroos that carry pic through to its not entirely believable denouement. Parker in a brave but calculated departure from breezy ""Sex and the City"" territory cant help but go overboard in her portrayal of a twitchy neurotic. Still thesp gets to show some impressive range in the third act when Meredith goes on an all-night bender and then must cope with the aftermath. Keaton embodies the formidable Stone matriarch with an offhand sense of humor that cuts like a knife. As Amy a deglammed but still radiant McAdams proves once again that shes the real deal delivering a deliciously feisty performance in an entirely different key from her work in ""Mean Girls."" Nelson makes a wonderfully affectionate father figure whose anger when provoked is fearsome to behold. The usually stiff Mulroney does some of his best least inhibited acting as Everett while Wilson as Ben appears to have taken a few smart tips from older brother Owen. Using tight compositions and closeups cinematographer Jonathan Brown induces a pervasive sense of claustrophobia within the Stones manse itself a marvelously idiosyncratic piece of production design by Jane Ann Stewart. Michael Giacchinos score inevitably more straightforward than his pulse-pounding orchestrations for ""The Incredibles"" and ""Lost"" is supplemented by a steady stream of vintage holiday tunes.
