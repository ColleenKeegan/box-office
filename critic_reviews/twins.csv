Director Ivan Reitman more than delivers on the wacky promise of Twins in this nutty storybook tale of siblings separated at birth and reunited at age 35. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Julius Benedict a perfect specimen of a man in both body and soul raised as an orphan in pristine innocence on a tropical isle. Created in a genetic experiment he has a twin brother on the mainland. Lionhearted Julius filled with familiar longing rushes off to LA to search for bro - only to discover hed have found him faster by looking under rocks. Danny DeVitos Vincent Benedict is a major creep a guy you wouldnt mind seeing get hit by a car. To him Julius is a dopey nut who makes a good bodyguard. They finally set out to locate their mother but Vincent still is on his incorigible path. Schwarzenegger is a delightful surprise in this perfect transitional role to comedy. So strongly does he project the tenderness nobility and puppy-dog devotion that make Julius tick that one is nearly hypnotized into suspending disbelief. DeVito is a blaze of energy and body language as Vince articulating the part as though hes written it himself. TwinsProductionUniversal.

The result of a scientific experiment in which their mother was impregnated with a sperm milk-shake derived from six male geniuses the twins were separated at birth. Arnie is now a naive super-intelligent virgin DeVito a small-time hustler. So when Arnie finally tracks down his long-lost brother its hardly fraternal love at first sight. The subplots about DeVitos problems with loan sharks exposing his residual avarice help to flesh out what is essentially a one-joke scenario; but more emotionally revealing are DeVitos selfish venal desire for Chloe Webb and Arnies innocent affection for her long-limbed sister (Preston). DeVito displays his remarkable ability to shift from fast-talking cynicism to affecting sentiment while Arnie reveals a reasonable talent for light comedy.

The reports that Arnold Schwarzenegger has a gift for comedy based on isolated double-entendres he has delivered in such films as Red Heat and The Terminator turn out to have been premature. In his new film Twins which is supposed to be funny the former Mr. Universe and pint-sized Danny DeVito play twins the result of a genetic experiment that went awry. To the extent that Twins is carried by anybody it is carried by Mr. DeVito. Mr. Schwarzenegger is dead weight. The gimmick is this having been separated at birth the brothers finally meet 35 years later in Los Angeles. The big joke is that Julius (Mr. Schwarzenegger) raised on an idyllic desert island is a perfect specimen of a man a genius pure in body as well as spirit. He is also - hold on to your sides - a virgin Vincent (Mr. DeVito) self-described as genetic trash is Juliuss opposite. Kicked out of the orphanage at age 14 after getting a nun into trouble Vincent is a womanizing con artist car thief and fast-talker. He also has enormous aplomb. While running down the street to escape an irate husband he uses an electric razor to take off his 5 oclock shadow. In the past Mr. Schwarzeneggers chief asset has been a willingness to send up what is taken to be the body builders arrogance and self-assurance. Its something else to play a naif which is as far out of his range as Henry V. Hes also beginning to look physically reconstituted. Its one of the oddities of Twins that though Mr. DeVito is balding overweight and undergrown he appears to be younger than his twin. The film is the latest in the list of sloppy comic extravaganzas directed by Ivan Reitman the auteur who earlier brought us Meatballs Stripes Legal Eagles and Ghostbusters. The direction is no less lame than the screenplay which has to do with the brothers search for their parents with industrial espionage with Mr. Schwarzeneggers losing his virginity and in one scene with Mr. DeVitos teaching his co-star how to waltz. Twins which opens today at the National and other theaters is the sort of movie that seems to be made of Styrofoam. Its instantly disposable but it wont quickly disappear. Twins which has been rated PG (Parental Guidance Suggested) contains some mildly vulgar language.

"Twins (PG-13) Twins (PG-13) By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer December 09 1988 ""Twins"" -- heres the long and the short of it Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito. A star vehicle from its onset this peculiar mediocre comedy strains to accommodate the talents of both Mutt and Jeff Terminator and troll. Its a Frankensteinian thing an unsettling combination of two-fisted beefcake and mean-spirited shtick. And theres enough sugary male bonding to warrant a Sensitive Guys Red Alert. Schwarzenegger a beatific -- or is it idiotic? -- smile on his Easter Island mug makes his comedy debut as stiff but lovable Julius in this freaky fantasy of brotherly love. And DeVito everybodys favorite little big man eases the transition for the brawny superstar crackling and popping off like a bowl of breakfast cereal. He is the shiftless Vincent the younger of the genetically engineered fraternal twins. Six geniuses combined sperm donations -- never mind the one-sperm-to-an-egg business -- so that the boys beautiful and talented mother might bear a superior child. Julius the brilliant bilingual Visigoth is that child. Vincent poignantly describes himself as ""a side effect."" When they are separated at birth Vincent is placed in an orphanage where he gets nuns in trouble while Julius is reared by a kindly tutor on a deserted South Seas island. Upon learning the truth the joyful Julius goes to Hollywood to find his brother. Though they have certain mannerisms in common they are not only physically but spiritually mismatched. Vincent a car thief womanizer and parking ticket welsher involves his naive brother in his shady dealings (a plot turn that gives Schwarzenegger a chance to kick butt and lift Cadillacs). But eventually he responds to his big brothers support and affection. Meanwhile Julius shakes off his innocence when he makes love for the first time. And Schwarzenegger loses his on-screen virginity rather sweetly -- though he remains one of our most romantically impaired leading men. Kelly Preston is Schwarzeneggers love interest one of the shapely blond sisters in salami-skin-tight skirts who accompany the twins on a search for their broodmare mommy. Chloe Webb love-interests DeVito and Bonnie Bartlett carried the genetically engineered darlings to term. Producer-director Ivan Reitman of ""Ghostbusters"" commissioned two pairs of writers to tailor this script to the heroes and it fits them like a cheap off-the-rack suit. Just say bro.
