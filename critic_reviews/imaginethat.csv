Especially when it suggests that the perpetrators of the credit crunch were spending too little - not too much - time listening to their seven year olds. Thats exactly what Denver exec Eddie Murphy does in this dreadfully flat family comedy since the financial advice of his daughter (Yara Shahidi a natural) and her imaginary friends rather spookily outdoes his own market soothsaying. Needless to say he becomes reliant on her suggestions with consequences that leave yawning gaps between anything even vaguely resembling a half-smile as the plot grinds its way towards some chastening lessons for workaholic daddy. Murphy at least tries to stay in character rather than overdoing the silly voices and physical knockabout but maybe the material was so blah that he felt it wasnt worth the effort. So there you have it a movie in which the innocence of a child helps her parent become a better capitalist all to the strains of sundry Beatles covers. Does one detect just the teeniest hint of cynicism?

Did you have to drag The Beatles down there with you? ""Imagine That"" which is studded (infested?) with simpering covers of Beatles songs that sound like they were produced by Barney stars an extravagantly miscast Murphy as a buttoned-down financial manager too busy to make time for the 7-year-old daughter (Yara Shahidi) whose custody he splits with his ex (Nicole Ari Parker). Murphy is the opposite of what we need which is an actor who is hard to picture cutting loose and acting childish when his girls chatter with her imaginary friends turns out to yield unerring stock-market tips. (No explanation is ever given for this gift not even one as weak as the fortune-telling machine in ""Big."") Evan (Murphy) bonds with the girl in pretend visits to her magical world so he can get her market views which he passes along to his clients verbatim One firm he notes is about to get its pants pulled down (this turns out to mean a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation) and those pants are filled with poop (fraudulent accounting). Cutesy? My pain was acutesy as the entire plot yawned before me. An hour and three-quarters to show Evan being a distant father getting in touch with his inner child making a lot of money but ultimately realizing that family is more important? That isnt three acts -- its three minutes or should have been. If youre hoping for some imaginative special effects dont. We never see the girls make-believe world just a few hundred scenes of Murphy frolicking dancing singing and (internally) suffering as his character extracts info from the girl. If at some point he had used eyelid Morse code to blink out an SOS -- like a hostage alerting the commandos -- I wouldnt have been surprised. At work Evan is taking heat from a rival (Thomas Haden Church or at least I think thats him under a wig that looks like an animal pelt) who presents himself as an American Indian guided by spirit wisdom (""In the middle of the night the dream sparrow comes to me"") that sounds more like peyote talking. Since no Hollywood studio is likely to poke fun at Native Americans its obvious from the start that his character is lying about his ancestry but the movie saves this as its idea of a twist. As for its idea of wordplay try this ""You make huge deals every day. Im sure youll find a way to deal with her."" Throughout the actual financial advice (""Buy long sell short. Sell short buy long"") given by supposed pros is such distilled gibberish as to suggest the screenwriters simply cut and pasted random words found in the Wall Street Journal. Murphy in a scene meant to reassure us that he is a whiz is shown guaranteeing his clients a return of 9 to 11 percent a year a textbook warning sign of fraud. Why dont the SECs poop police come and pull his pants down? Come to think of it in a bold new era of regulatory experimentation why arent there script inspectors tasked with notifying movies that theyre imaginatively bankrupt? kyle.smithnypost.com IMAGINE THAT Junk bonding. Running time 106 minutes. Rated PG (mild profanity brief questionable behavior). At the E-Walk the Magic Johnson the 84th Street others.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Imagine That Comedy. Directed by Karey Kirkpatrick. Starring Eddie Murphy. (PG 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Imagine That"" director Karey Kirkpatricks live-action debut has a few nagging problems none of which are Eddie Murphys fault. Thats the good news. For the first time in close to forever he exhibits some of the old hopped-up sassiness and Gumby elasticity that made him a star. Hes also starring in a comedy without any high-concept CGI or lowbrow fat suits. Theres not a single pompous micro-alien (""Meet Dave"") or distended latex tummy (""Norbit"") to be found in ""Imagine That"" a mostly innocuous affair - outfitted with folksy Beatles covers - that revolves around a divorced high-finance hotshot named Evan (Murphy) and his darling but troubled daughter Olivia (Yara Shahidi). Olivias been bringing her security blanket to school. She flops it over her head for long chatty visits with her imaginary friends a family of princesses - and one queen plus a dragon - in a magical forest kingdom in and around Denver. You never see it or them. You never hear them either. But they certainly are an opinionated and investment-savvy bunch judging from their repeated interference with Evans work life. It seems they can foretell mergers acquisitions and sudden financial cave-ins with the cutthroat business acumen of inside traders. For Evan this imaginary intel arrives not a moment too soon. Hes been stressing but not for the usual reasons; the entire movie takes place in a shiny alternative dimension where the stock market never crashed. No the bane of Evans life is Johnny Whitefeather (Thomas Haden Church) a co-worker whos been poaching his clients and sucking up to the boss (Ronny Cox Murphys ""Beverly Hills Cop"" compatriot). Whitefeather calls Evan ""Little Elk"" and intones like a dime-store shaman (""Its not the paint that makes the warrior"") while Evan angling for a promotion stays up late analyzing reams of tedious data on his computer. This is another one of the movies problems - investment opportunities tend to bore anyone who isnt making money off them. ""Imagine That"" bears a passing resemblance to Adam Sandlers ""Bedtime Stories"" but it reminded me more of Dwayne Johnsons ""The Game Plan"" an innocuous little message movie about an ego-tripping workaholic who learns life lessons from his impossibly cute daughter and her fondness for sparkles. In ""Imagine That"" the plot turns distasteful and shrill before its tidy resolution at the close. By all means let us witness the dragged-out humiliation of Evan - thats kind of the point - but why traumatize little girls in the process? -- AdvisoryMild language and brief questionable behavior.

(Bruce McBroom) Eddie Murphy is charming opposite Yara Shahidi.(Bruce McBroom) Imagine That Add to ... Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 11 2009 358PM EDT Last updated Wednesday Jun. 17 2009 547PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Imagine That Directed by Karey Kirkpatrick Written by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson Starring Eddie Murphy Thomas Haden Church and Yara Shahidi Classification G Imagine that - an Eddie Murphy comedy thats actually endearing. After his string of fat-suit and groan-inducing family comedies ( The Haunted Mansion  Daddy Day Care ) Murphys new film opening in time for Fathers Day is a mildly pleasant shock. Murphy plays Evan Daniels a Denver-based financial whiz whose estranged wife (Nicole Ari Parker) insists he needs to spend a week bonding with their seven-year-old daughter Olivia (Yara Shahidi). Obsessed with his computer charts and cell phone calls Evan treats the presence of his daughter like a professional handicap but Olivia listens to everything he says. Hiding under her blue security blanket and talking with a trio of imaginary princess friends she starts offering advice on what decisions he should make. When Evan inadvertently parrots her intuitions hes unexpectedly successful and soon begins enjoying the double benefit of earning kudos at work and getting to know his kid. Even more unexpectedly Murphy is low-key and charming playing opposite his scene-stealing co-star. The two have a terrific rapport through some extended scenes - fighting playing imaginary games learning to sing and making messy pancakes with disgusting toppings. In contrast to Adam Sandlers similarly themed Bedtime Stories  the filmmakers have made an astute choice to avoid any special effects. Murphy and Shahidi march around his condo stepping from a spot on the floor they call France to another which is designated as a fairy-tale forest. Together they pacify dragons dodge hurled rocks and talk to Olivias imaginary royal friends who apparently hover just over Evans three computer monitors. The script by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson ( Bill amp; Teds Excellent Adventure and its sequel) is similar to a 1994 episode of The Simpsons  Lisa the Greek in which Homer gets close to Lisa when he discovers she can predict football scores. The message in each case is about the dangerous confusion of love and money. Naturally theres a turning point (around the time Evan is screaming outside a neighbours house desperately trying to recover Olivias blanket) where the child begins to wonder whether her father really loves her or just her profitable talent. As long as the movie involves just Murphy and the child director Karey Kirpatrick (the writer of such childrens films as Over the Hedge  Chicken Run and James and the Giant Peach ) does a good job reining in Murphys mugging and capitalizing on the stars considerable warmth. Outside of Evans tony bachelor pad though the movie gets a lot less subtle as Evan brings his inner child into the board room (""This company is do-do stinky ca-ca""). There are too many scenes of Murphys character doing motor-mouth improvising about mergers bauxite mines and fibre optics then could possibly interest either children or adults. Theres also a subplot about Evans rival - played by Thomas Haden Church as a transparently fake Native American financial ""rainmaker"" named Johnny Whitefeather - whose nonsense sales pitches are a combination of Native American mysticism and motivational blather. Though Haden Church is great at projecting complacent ridiculousness the shtick isnt funny enough to justify its prominence. Finally given the movies early creative promise the ending is disappointingly trite. Its possible that some children wont guess what will happens when Evan must choose between a big job interview and an important event in Olivias life - but frankly its hard to imagine that.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Shes so pretty yet unassuming. Just what a director might want in a co-star to a ham like Eddie Murphy someone who catches your eye makes you wonder how much she would shine in a better film. Were not talking about Yara Shahidi the impressive newcomer who plays money manager Evan Danielsons 7-year-old daughter Olivia in the middling family comedy ""Imagine That."" Shes the real deal -- darling but not too. So who then? Why Denver. ""Imagine That"" is set and was partially shot in the Mile High City. Small wonder the film commission and local filmmakers and crews continue to push for tax incentives. Our town looks good in this story about a dad whose fortunes change when he enters his neglected daughters imaginary world. Her portal to that realm of princesses and a queen with an unerring grasp of market forces is a blanket she calls her ""Goo-gaa."" Financial whiz Evan (Murphy) is being given a run for his money at his firm by new guy Johnny Whitefeather (Thomas Haden Church). His hair is long his pitch polished like the silver on a squash- blossom necklace from a roadside stand. From the start Whitefeather seems like a huckster of Native American spirituality. Its hard to believe any client or boss would fall for it. But tumble they do. Chant they do. As Evan and Johnnys competition heats up the career-obsessed dad is finally being forced to act like a father. He and wife Trish (Nicole Ari Parker) are separated. DeRay Davis is sweet as Evans friend/client and a former Bronco who embraces his daddy duties with aplomb. Parker who often finds an emotional foothold even in slippery comedies doesnt have a lot to do as Trish. But she expresses frustration without falling back on antagonism. Kid-marketed movies too often seem pitched to the so-called grown-ups in the multiplex. They wink they nudge. ""Imagine That"" raises questions about its true target audience but for a different reason. Its not that the jokes are aimed at adults. The lessons are. Its a fable about fatherhood directed toward boneheaded value- confused pops. Unfortunately Evans transformation rings tinny. The music guides us to the appropriate moods (This is magical This is goofy) because Murphys performance doesnt. The most satisfying laugh may be a scene between the money manager and Nuggets stars Carmelo Anthony and some guy we traded for beloved Chauncey Billups. Where was the Goo-gaa when the filmmakers were thinking up that scene? ""IMAGINE THAT"" PG for some mild language and brief questionable behavior. 1 hour 47 minutes. Directed by Karey Kirkpatrick; written by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson; photography by John Lindley; starring Eddie Murphy Thomas Haden Church Yara Shahidi Nicole Ari Parker Ronny Cox and Martin Sheen.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. June 12 2009Eddie Murphy Thomas Haden Church and Yara Shahidi. 107 minutes. Directed by Karey Kirkpatrick. G Imagine That is a family-friendly popcorn muncher that reminds us of two things imagination is a wondrous thing and while adults are busy acting their pants off a smart little girl with curls can always make off with the picture.Eddie Murphy brings his familiar arsenal of voices quirks and jerks as an absentee dad who professes to love his daughter while not having much time for her.A player in the pre-meltdown financial planning world Evan (Murphy) is a Denver financial whiz who specializes in fattening portfolios while his parental skills stock tumbles into the red.Estranged from his wife (Nicole Ari Parker) Evan hasnt got a clue how to deal with their precocious 7-year-old daughter Olivia (Yara Shahidi) when its his turn to look after her for a week. Whats worse the girl spends a great deal of time huddled under her blanket whispering to her trio of imaginary princess pals and their queen.Article Continued BelowEvan has enough to worry about what with rival Johnny Whitefeather (Thomas Haden Church) the offices slick mullet-sporting market mastermind using corny native pseudo-wisdom about brother salmon and dream sparrows to lure Evans clients away.But Evans lack of interest in Olivia does a 180 when the royal figments of her fertile imagination suddenly start sharing some very savvy market advice. Soon uptight Evan is happily hopping around his lavish condo with Olivia dodging dragons scooting through France and inching along imaginary caves to consult with the princesses. Director Karey Kirkpatrick (Over the Hedge) lets us use our imaginations on the journey wisely avoiding CGI trickery.Murphys antics are genuinely funny in these daddy moments and young Yara Shahidi shines as Olivia. Soon Evan is repeating the princesses market advice drop poopy-pants stocks and grab the one with pretty hair and sparkles.Dads stock rises at home too and he and Olivia are bonding like never before - so long as the magic blanket stays in the picture and the princesses keep picking winners.Reworked Beatles tunes make for a pleasing soundtrack and theres a solid supporting cast including Martin Sheen as a corporate bigwig. The kids tend to fare better than the adults in comic roles watch for Bobbe J. Thompson as a larcenous youngster in a bit part.The plot is obvious as can be and theres nothing about Imagine That destined to follow you home. But heres a summer movie that kids will laugh at and parents can take them to without worrying about sex violence language or projectile vomiting jokes.

Mark Kelly looks back at the series which includes The Bourne Identity The Bourne Supremacy The Bourne Ultimatum and The Bourne Legacy. Image Universal Pictures/Everett Collection By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 29 2016 710 p.m. ET 79 COMMENTS Heres to truth in advertising. Go to the official website for "" Jason Bourne"" and what pops up immediately is a nonstop loop of riots raging fires car chases car crashes and brutishly ugly hand-to-hand combat interspersed with occasional glimpses of Matt Damons scowling countenance. Loops are by definition nonstop and the only way you can get rid of this one is to close the window. Still its a fair representation of the movie which puts its hero through a much longer loop of heavy-duty punishment interspersed with familiar sequences of omniscient electronic surveillance. Bourne used to be an anguished amnesiac. Now he remembers who he is but this fourth episode of the franchise forgot to make him human. Instead of using the last pieces of his self-discovery to open him up the film makes him more tightly shut down than ever a relentlessly grim avenger who wants to expose yet another nefarious program being hatched by a CIA that aspires to ""full-spectrum surveillance"" or watching everyone all the time. The chases are exciting up to a point; the director Paul Greengrass is a virtuoso filmmaker. But oh how they do vroom on. And when Bourne isnt being chased by a villainous agency assassin played by Vincent Cassel or by cops in various countries who do the agencys bidding hes being tracked by an array of technologies that give new meaning to whats become an obligatory phrase in high-tech thrillers ""Give me eyeballs on him."" (The most prominent snoops are the CIAs director Robert Dewey who is played by Tommy Lee Jones and his deputy Alicia Vikanders Heather Lee.) More Reviews Gleason Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films Those all-seeing eyes of a digital god include as in previous episodes satellites a seeming infinitude of CCTV cameras and facial recognition systems that can pick Bournes face out of every crowd he tries to hide in. Omniscient surveillance has to be sure become an action-thriller staple even though it drains suspense by making chases easier just as computers have weakened police procedurals by making investigations easier. Whats newish here is the numbing amount of time the film spends on people halfway around the globe watching Bourne on myriad screens while giving his pursuers turn-by-turn directions that Waze users could only dream of. If you want to be generous toward the all-the-worlds-a-network screenplay that Mr. Greengrass wrote with the films editor Christopher Rouse its a lively sampling of themes ripped from the headlines or from classic films cyberwarfare; Edward Snowden; ""The Terminator"" (the villain drives a destructo truck); ""The Manchurian Candidate""; the cybersecurity conflict between personal privacy and public safety ( Riz Ahmed is Aaron Kalloor aka Steve Zuckerberg Gates a Silicon Valley titan whos been in bed with the CIA and wants to climb out). But if youre not feeling generous--and I leaned to the Not side after less than an hour--its a collection of repetitive tropes that Mr. Rouses pumped-up editing has turned into a two-hour version of a 100-yard dash. ( Barry Ackroyd did the flashy cinematography.) Watch a film clip from Jason Bourne starring Matt Damon and Julia Stiles. Photo Universal Pictures Mr. Damon is as always a strong presence; its remarkable that he can do such a buoyant man on Mars and such a dour Jason Bourne. Ms. Vikander taking over where Joan Allen left off makes up in appealing ambiguity what she lacks in Ms. Allens steeliness. Julia Stiles is back and welcome as Nicky Parsons. Mr. Jones has been made up--some of that is makeup isnt it?--to look like a cross between Lucifer and Nixon and he does his airy-authority number with well airy authority. He also gets--and earns--what is by my count the only laugh in the entire film. You dont go to a Bourne movie to laugh of course but neither do you go to get worn down. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download The Martian (2015) Matt Damons astronaut Mark Watney doesnt just struggle to survive on Mars after his crew assumes he has died during an epic storm and leaves him behind. He lives a rich intense life sustained by wry humor piercing intelligence and an irrepressible spirit of invention.

"Movie Review Eddie Murphy Shows Off Comic Skills in Imagine That washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Talk +| Comments Movie Review Eddie Murphy Shows Off Comic Skills in Imagine That In ""Imagine That"" Eddie Murphys Evan Danielson tries to learn the stock secrets hidden in the imaginary world of his young daughter Olivia (Yara Shahidi). (By Bruce Mcbroom -- Paramount Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By John Anderson Special to The Washington Post Friday June 12 2009 Dignity and comedy probably sound as complementary as hors doeuvres and anvils especially for those whove grown up in the desperation era of Jim Carrey Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg. But fractured dignity is the lifeblood of great comedy and has defined the great comedians -- Charlie Chaplin Buster Keaton Harold Lloyd Woody Allen. Even the man whose dignity is so abused in ""Imagine That."" This StoryA Funny Eddie Murphy? ImagineFind Imagine That Showtimes TicketsSummer Movie GuideDiscuss Predict the Weekend Box Office WinnerView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Eddie Murphy. There. I said it. I know what youre thinking Eddie Murphy? Dignity? The man who appeared in ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash""? Just thinking about going to an Eddie Murphy movie at this point can make you walk lopsided. On one shoulder theres this tiny little angel whispering "" Shrek . . . Dreamgirls . . . Mr. Robinsons Neighborhood. "" On the other theres a Hummer-size demon bellowing "" Norbit . . . Daddy Day Care . . . Dr. Dolittle"" You dont need a movie. You need a chiropractor. But ""Imagine That"" in which the comedian plays a buccaneer stock analyst redeemed by fatherhood and fantasy is also a redemptive act for Murphy whose often deliriously misguided efforts have made us forget what a naturally gifted and virtuosic comedian he is. Through pure comic timing he rescues whats wrong in a movie in which very much is right. And to a large degree he reasserts why hes great and others arent Watching him as the desperate Evan Danielson singing a song to an invisible princess in his daughters invisible fantasy world because he thinks the princess can give him a stock tip you feel a lot of things. Hilarity certainly. But also pain. Which makes it all the funnier. If Murphy were Seth Rogen we wouldnt even blink. ""Imagine That"" is not a masterpiece by any means and it follows a fairly hackneyed premise Although its beyond belief Evan has discovered that his strange little daughter Olivia (Yara Shahidi) the one he shares custody of with his ex-wife (Nicole Ari Parker) the one who wont give up her blanket (a.k.a. the Goo-Gaa) is channeling stock tips out of her imaginary world. Where was Olivia when AIG needed her? Okay sometimes the tips come in the form of ""she has nice hair"" or ""he doesnt play well with others"" but its all code for ""buy"" and ""sell."" All Evan has to do is go there. Its refreshing that in a movie out of an effects-besotted Hollywood Evan and Olivia only imagine their travels rather than running a gantlet of computer-generated hallucinations; they still look the same to us as they gather their tips. This may turn out to be one of the more endearing aspects of ""Imagine That"" at least to its youngest audiences the ones who are still able to travel widely via the special effects inside their heads. Shahidi is beautiful and natural as Olivia; she could give a good name to kid actors. But the really distinguished supporting player is Thomas Haden Church as an inspired character -- Johnny Whitefeather a faux mystic who parlays Native American spirituality into snake-oil salesmanship and stock portfolios. Meanwhile Murphys Evan is believable sympathetic and often very funny. And the movie which may be an anomaly in the career of Eddie Murphy takes a step toward reasserting his place as the comic heir not just to such obvious models as Richard Pryor (whom he is supposed to be playing in an upcoming biopic) but also Groucho Marx. The return of Eddie Murphy? Imagine that. Imagine That (107 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mild language and questionable behavior. >> This StoryRead +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  A Funny Eddie Murphy?

ABOUT THE MOVIEImagine That  out of four Stars Eddie Murphy Yara Shahidi Thomas Haden Church Nicole Ari Parker Ronny CoxDirector Karey KirkpatrickDistributors Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon MoviesRating PG for some mild language and brief questionable behaviorRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesOpens today nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Its not hard to imagine how nearly every scene in Imagine That will play out. Eddie Murphy stars as a workaholic father too distracted by his work to engage in flights of fancy with his adorable daughter. Murphy mugs and grimaces pulling off physical contortions with manic energy. Yara Shahidi who plays his daughter fares better. She has an innate charm that contrasts with Murphys over-the-top efforts. Their few relaxed scenes together are among the movies best. Its too bad theres little to distinguish this predictable tale from any other comedy about an overly busy father who finally connects with his child. Reminiscent of The Game Plan a surprise 2007 hit that benefited from the charisma of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson Imagine That feels like a pallid imitation. Once a clever comedian Murphy lost his edge a while ago. This movie has even fewer laughs than MeetDave though its better than Daddy Day Care. Imagine spends too much time in the boardroom and too much time on the adult world to be viable family entertainment. But it does have moments of sweetness. Murphy plays Evan a financial executive who is obsessed with upward mobility. He and his ex-wife Trish (Nicole Ari Parker) are the parents of spunky 7-year-old Olivia (Shahidi). Evans work-obsessed life and sterile-looking bachelor pad are ill-suited for the complications of child-rearing. At the same time his career takes a downward spiral. Evan is annoyed by the new-agey piffle of Johnny Whitefeather (Thomas Haden Church) a Native American whose inane pronouncements are taken by clients as financial wisdom. After his daughter draws him into her elaborate fantasy world Evans work improves. Olivias vivid imagination appears to hold the key to his success insider stock tips from a queen and princesses who inhabit an imaginary kingdom. But its not always clear whether Evan is tapping into his inner child to connect with his daughter or to exploit her talent for predicting financial winners. Shahidi is an endearing natural presence and she and Murphy have some likable moments. But the story doesnt focus enough on the strengthening bond between father and daughter instead wasting time on office shenanigans and discussion of commodities and mergers. Though Imagine Thats message is benign its adult focus is off-base and every move feels too familiar formulaic and telegraphed.

She brings out in Murphy whats been missing from films such as Norbit - spontaneous play. Shahidis and Murphys scenes together have such warmth tenderness and joy that they elevate this cookie-cutter comedy into homemade fun.Evan has two problems. One Whitefeather (Thomas Haden Church) his Native American colleague is aiming to steal his clients. Two Olivia upset by the estrangement of her parents will not surrender her security blanket at school where she talks more with her imaginary friends than her real ones.In this gentle fantasy from director Karey Kirkpatrick (who wrote the screenplay for the recent Charlottes Web) it may be that Olivias imaginary friends are crack stock analysts. And that her security blanket is a ""securities blanket"" - a magic cloth accurately predicting market outcomes.Thankfully the fantasy elements are implicit rather than explicit; the movie is not an inventory of special effects like the recent Bedtime Stories. Thus the audience like Evan accepts what Olivia says on faith.The daddy/daughter sequences are wonderful particularly a scene in which Evan teaches Olivia how to sing without really singing. Less successful is the corporate one-upmanship though when Evan and Whitefeather fight each other it has the feel of the schoolyard.While Imagine That falls short of its feel-good aim its feel-nice vibe is a good Fathers Day diversion for Dads and their spawn.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Imagine That | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; imagine-that ) Imagine That (United States 2009) June 11 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Watching Imagine That I was beset by a feeling of intense depression. Is this what Eddie Murphy has become? Once moviedoms most high-octane comedian a combustible mixture of raunchy non-holds-barred verbal repartee and kinetic physical mayhem Murphy has now become a sad parody of his former self. These days his comedic set list includes juvenile gross-out material (with mismatched condiments standing in for bodily functions this time around) mugging for the camera and lame pratfalls. He has devolved below the least common denominator targeting his material for the six-year olds who have become the strongest cornerstone of his fan base. I laughed once during Imagine Thats interminable 107 minutes and the longer I watched Murphys desperate embarrassing attempts at provoking laughter the worse I felt. Granted the actors recent resume offers little reason for optimism but it took Imagine That to convince me that the man who dazzled in Trading Places and 48 Hours will never again grace the screen. I feel like Im writing an obituary. If the failure of the comedy isnt reason enough to avoid the movie its dramatic missteps are even more unforgiveable. The movies central relationship is between a workaholic father and his poor neglected daughter. The filmmakers pull out all the stops making their interaction stomach churningly mawkish. If theres a manipulative tool eschewed by director Karey Kirkpatrick I dont know what it is. Theres also a sense that Imagine That wants to have its cake eat it and regurgitate it for second-hand consumption. Talk about mixed messages. Are we supposed to be rooting for this narcissistic jerk to find redemption with his daughter? Suddenly everything turns out okay because he makes a dramatic last-minute entrance? What kind of twisted moral is Imagine That embracing regarding parenting? This is the kind of thing one expects to see in deep dark satires not in family-oriented dramedies. The movie believes that because the girl is over-the-top cute well cheer the happy ending. But happy endings have to be earned and this one is not. Its dishonest and repugnant. Evan Danielson (Murphy) is a financial analyst at a Denver investment firm that is about to undergo a major restructuring. Longtime CEO Tom Stevens (Ronny Cox) is selling the company to a Donald Trump figure Dante DEnzo (Martin Sheen) who intends to fold the new acquisition into his empire. He initiates an Apprentice challenge to Evan and his biggest in-house competitor Johnny Whitefeather (Thomas Haden Church). Whoever impresses him the most will get a top position in the conglomeration. Evans situation is complicated by the presence of his seven-year old daughter Olivia (Yara Shahidi) who is staying with him for the week while her mother (Nicole Ari Parker) is otherwise engaged. Desperate for her fathers attention Olivia dips into her make-believe world and consults a group of princesses about how certain stocks and corporations will fare. At first Evan ignores her advice but when the predictions start coming true he re-evaluates the validity of her imaginary friends. Although he cant see them he starts to play along and soon becomes obsessed with spending time with his daughter not because of who she is but because of what she can do for his career. The title implies that the movie explores the realm of fairy tales and childlike creativity but that belief is as delusional as the one that Imagine That is anything other than pandering tedium. Those wanting to see a genuinely creative exploration of make-believe can cross A Bridge to Terabithia which accomplishes the difficult task of cinematically embodying the elusive magic of a childs imagination. Even Adam Sandlers mediocre Bedtime Stories does it better as hard as that may be to visualize. In Imagine That its reduced to Murphy running around his home after his daughter and dancing in front of a crowd of mocking bystanders as he tries to attract the attention of one of the princesses. (Or is it the queen?) Since we never see any part of Olivias world (budgetary constraints?) were forced to imagine it and the film doesnt come close to getting us to the point where were able to clear that hurdle. While Murphys recent resume (excepting Dreamgirls) might lead to low expectations for his cinematic endeavors the involvement of director Kary Kirkpatrick could have been a cause for limited optimism. Kirkpatricks resume is solid. His only previous directorial outing was Over the Hedge an amusing animated effort but he has written a number of noteworthy screenplays including those for The Spiderwick Chronicles and Chicken Run. Perhaps the problem with Imagine That is that he wasnt involved in the writing. Whatever the case this is as disappointing a live-action debut as one can envision. Still its hard to consider Imagine That an unmitigated failure. It will probably entertain the most undiscriminating and uncritical portion of its target audience young children most of whom will sit through anything featuring live-action figures imitating cartoon characters. Theyll love Eddie Murphys trampoline encounter and his pancake meal. For parents absorbing the blow necessary to entertain their offspring it will take more than an active imagination to make believe that Imagine That is anything more than two hours of torture.

Imagine That Director Karey Kirkpatrick. Cast Eddie Murphy Thomas Haden Church Yara Shahidi. Rating PG for mild language and questionable behavior. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Spotlight Eddie Murphy This time Murphy low-keys it as Evan Danielson a financial exec who learns that when his daughters imaginary friends speak hed better listen. Evan you see is gearing up for a big promotion when his estranged wife (Nicole Ari Parker) asks him to take daughter Olivia (Yara Shahidi) for a week. Its clear that Evan wants to be a good dad but his parenting skills could use a lot of work particularly when it comes time to separate the girl from her beloved security blanket. He has second thoughts about that task when Olivia lets him in on a secret The blanket is a doorway to a magical kingdom where the royal family has remarkable insight into such financial fine points as derivatives and corporate mergers. And director Karey Kirkpatricks plot now is on track for Predictable City. If you think its hilarious when Murphy mugs and dances and sings in falsetto to earn the favor of tip-dispensing princesses well you can have my share of the laughs. If not at least Murphy doesnt wear a fat suit. But the actors scenes with movie daughter Shahidi have an undeniable sweetness and Shahidi is adorable in a role that easily could have seemed manipulative. Meanwhile Thomas Haden Church lubes up as unctuous corporate rival Johnny Whitefeather who awes clients with New Agey Native American-ish hoo-ha and Martin Sheen plays a finance wizard. Enjoy the new boat Mr. Sheen. Its all very light and silly. But save for one unusually leaden scene in which a group of kids led by junior extortionist Bobbe J. Thompson pelts Murphy in a ball pit (that the screening audience didnt so much as titter restores my faith in humanity) theres barely a mean or crude bone in this body. This from an industry that has come to equate flatulence jokes with family comedy. Imagine that.

(Paramount Pictures) Joe Neumaier Thursday June 11 2009 145 PM Title Imagine That A financial executive saves his job when his daughters play world inspires him. With Eddie Murphy. Director Karey Kirkpatrick. (136). PG Mild adult situations. At area theaters What a happy surprise. Unlike the easy wish-fulfillment of Adam Sandlers recent ""Bedtime Stories"" ""Imagine That"" respects both the younger and older members of its audience and ends up earning an emotional payoff. And for the first time since ""The Nutty Professor"" Eddie Murphy successfully mixes his adult and kid-film personas -- imagine that. Much of the movie skews a bit older than its 6-year-old heroine due to the early attention the screenplay by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson gives to career obsession. Evan Danielson (Murphy) a self-centered driven financial analyst is in the midst of a marital separation thats impacting his daughter Olivia (Yara Shahidi). To ease her pain Olivia pretends that under her blanket is a magical land of princesses dragons and limitless love. When Evans future at his firm is endangered by a wily co-worker named Johnny Whitefeather (Thomas Haden Church) who uses a vague Native American heritage to justify some hilariously New Age-y dances with numbers Olivia recommends Evan ask her make-believe princess friends for help. And by the sheer power of play Evan taps into a winning work strategy that naturally brings him closer to his child. Yes it sounds treacly. But all the covers of Beatles tunes help as does the fact that inside ""Imagine That"" are two movies co-existing peacefully. One is an 80s-style workplace comedy manifested in Haden Churchs muscular parody of the Wise Old Hippie. Stomping around with his cool-guy hair -- a bolo tie and feather announcing his spiritual credentials -- Haden Church almost steals the show as a guy who knows how grownups (i.e. corporate clients) want to believe in forces stronger than themselves. Contrasting that is Olivia her blanket and the make-believe world she knows isnt true but wants her dad to dive into anyway. Murphys always best when he doesnt let us forget the edgy comic he once was and thats here keeping the sweetness from becoming saccharine. And the movie doesnt tie things up with a third-act marriage salvation; the point is Evan and Olivia reconnecting. And its about Evan rediscovering not his inner child but the ability to be raw and delirious. As the adorable Shahidi leads Murphy through an invisible fairy-tale world the gusto with which he talks to the (thankfully unseen) princesses is a response to his overall desperation If he has enough fun maybe itll change his reality. Look what that theorys already done for its star. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

First you have to get past the dragon and its master who can be persuaded by a song-and-dance number then shuffle through a cave until you get to a beach--and be sure to keep a smile on your face At the end of the line there are two beautiful princesses and if you sweet-talk them enough theyll grant you the most splendiferous wish anyone has ever conceived Surefire stock tips Has there ever been a less enchanting idea for an imaginary world than that one? Or any worse timing for it than now when the stock market is viewed as ephemeral and corrupt and the wizards of Wall Street are being chased with pitchforks? Given his growing track record of odious kiddie fare its no surprise to see Eddie Murphy squandering his talents as another in a long line of movie dads who are too wrapped up in their jobs to pay attention to their kids. Murphys responsibilities as a market maestro and a father combine harmoniously when he discovers that daughter Shahidis imaginary friends are like little Charlie Sheens--a font of inside information. This helps Murphy get the jump on rival Thomas Haden Church who uses gimmicky Native American schtick to give him an edge. As an example of how crudely Imagine That establishes Murphy as a slickster with his priorities out of whack here are a few signs that hes a neglectful father He has Bluetooth in his ear gazes at three computer monitors side-by-side and lives in an apartment with a private-access elevator hardwood floors and impractical furniture. Though he commits to a lot of embarrassing silliness Murphy projects so little genuine warmth that his transformation barely registers especially when the sellout ending doesnt require a shred of real sacrifice.

(Bruce Mcbroom) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / June 12 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Imagine That"" is family-movie mediocrity (lately it seems that unless were talking about Pixar theres no other kind). A workaholic dad bonds with his creative 6-year-old daughter who brings him to her imaginary world which due either to lack of money or well imagination the audience doesnt get to see. You can take the title any number of ways as a command the beginning of a sentence that trails off what someone says when surprised by a bit of news or how one feigns that surprise. Eddie Murphy in another mediocre family comedy? Imagine that.But the movie ho-hum as it is manages to be oddly worryingly of interest. You want to see how much the cynicism can swallow up the wholesomeness. Its like watching a snake eat a mouse. The divorced workaholic dad Evan (Murphy) is a high-level investment banker. The daughter Olivia (Yara Shahidi) talks to imaginary friends. The father whos in the middle of several major deals cant be bothered with the little girl or her imaginary world - until her chums start giving him sound investment advice. Suddenly hes thrilled to run around his Denver loft cover his head with Olivias favorite blanket and ask her fake friends for real recommendations about which companies to invest in.This is like watching one of those financial commercials that play during changeovers on tennis broadcasts. The movies actual ads even come with an apt tag line ""What if your daughters imagination was the secret to your success?"" UBS and ING must be kicking themselves. But a cute advertising premise stretched to feature length kills the charm of a gag that should last no longer than 50 seconds.Directed by Karey Kirkpatrick and written by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson authors of the first two ""Bill amp; Ted"" movies ""Imagine That"" goes on for well over 90 minutes. Its clogged with earnest covers of Beatles music and leaves you in a bind about the father-daughter relationship. Olivia has no idea what her advice means. She thinks shes just helping Daddy. And boy is she. Hes this close to trumping his nearest rival a flamboyant American Indian (Thomas Haden Church) who gives Power Point presentations with nature backgrounds and tree-stump pie charts. The white bluebloods eat up his slideshows and tribal counseling (""The best spear is the one you dont throw"").Some movies seem like they might have been written by executives at a board meeting. This one seems like it was written by executives in a golf cart. (A securities blanket? Really?) What child wants to listen to men wearing suits in drab-looking offices talk about a 4 percent reallocation away from some kind of arbitrage?The movie was made before the economic crisis but the idea of two adult bankers desperately relying on kids and mumbo jumbo for investment tips inadvertently explains how we got there (""I wanted to ask about magnesium futures"" says Evan to an imaginary queen). But ""Imagine That"" is not a farce - not on purpose. Its a cartoon. And the children at the screening I attended seemed to enjoy it well enough. Who doesnt love a kid high on energy drink? Or a little smart alec? For the smart alec Murphy shares a too-brief scene with Bobbe J. Thompson the reigning bad boy of underage blue comedy which for Murphy must be like Dorian Gray in reverse. (Will Murphy ever curse again?)But really if theres a reason to sit through any of this (and Im not saying the reason is that compelling) its the connection Murphy has with Shahidi a sweet eloquent cutup. This is the umpteenth occasion Murphy has shared the screen with either a child a pet or in this case a pet child. But here the children bring out the best - OK the better - in him. The choice not to show Olivias world is justified only by the fun he and Shahidi have pretending the place exists.They make pancakes which she douses in a range of non-maple condiments. Murphy teaches her how to sing a song for a school show (the movie saves its syrup for that sequence) and she parodies his guttural gospel. ""Oh my baby sound like Minnie Riperton"" he exclaims. Not quite. But this little girl makes starring in such a crass excuse for an early Fathers Day gift more tolerable than it has any right to be.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"movie review imagine that imagine that movie review eddie murphy thomas haden church - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Imagine That -- 3 out of 5 stars Yara Shahidi and Eddie Murphy Paramount Paramount Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Eddie Murphy finds his Inner Cosby in Imagine That a comedy that is long on Cosby-like kid-friendly charm even if it falls short in the funny department. He keeps the mugging to a minimum and smartly allows the moppet (Yara Shahidi) playing his daughter steal scene after scene of this tale of a father-daughter relationship in need of fixing.Murphy plays Evan a workaholic dad who has lost his marriage (Nicole Ari Parker plays the wife) by putting his job first. He so ignores their daughter Olivia that the ex wonders if he ever wanted kids in the first place. He did he assures her. ""I just didnt know Id be so bad at it.""That line and the way Murphy plays it -- with conviction and disappointment -- sets the tone for Imagine That. Its about career and greed and the Wall Street wizards (its set in Denver) who work seven days a week put family second and still managed to hurl the country into a recession. And its about that other tried-and-true maxim of family film -- ""Listen to your children."" Evan is a stock analyst fighting for his career against a rival named Johnny Whitefeather a Native American who isnt above playing up the Wise Indian shtick talking of the ""One Sky"" above us all listening to ""The Dream Sparrow"" so that he can ""rain down prosperity. And how."" Whitefeather is played with stereotypical glee by Thomas Haden Church far and away the funniest thing in the movie.When Evan is forced to take care of his sullen 7-year-old for a week he sees the damage the divorce has done to the girl. Not right away of course. Shes withdrawn at school hiding under her ""goo ga"" (security blanket) communing with imaginary princesses and dodging imaginary dragons. Its only when she interjects at his workplace calling this company ""crybabies"" and other firms ""kissing"" (signifying a merger) that Evan gets curious about her world and tries to find a way into it.Theres real warmth to the father-daughter scenes a cute narration that shows a childs view of Daddys job. Director Karey Kirkpatrick wisely chose not to visualize the imaginary world and those who live in it but Murphy gets to do little dances and sing little songs to appease his daughters princesses. He has a lovely scene trying to teach the child to sing ""All You Need is Love.""But sweet as all that stuff is the money moments are the war between the posing Native American mystic and Evan who now uses childish metaphors to make his competing stock pitches to clients. Church gets the better of these exchanges because he has a much funnier character to play -- howling like a coyote labeling co-workers ""Brother Crow"" pumping his son full of Red Bull in an attempt to make him a ""child seer"" like Evans kid. By comparison Murphys goofy bug-eyed hysterics seem played out and overly familiar. Evan is a guy who sits too deep in Murphys comfort zone to be surprising or funny.The kid is a wonder and the heart is here characters given lovely story arcs a stellar supporting cast (Ronny Cox Martin Sheen Bruce McGill Mel Harris) that plays the reality of moments instead of reaching for broad laughs.But when youre making a family comedy players need to go for those laughs especially the star. The Inner Cosby should have told Eddie that.

But Murphy turns the role into a one-man Romper Room. He minces he contorts his face into twitchy grimaces he collapses into fits of mock hysteria so intense that the mock all but falls away. And thats before he learns that his daughter (Yara Shahidi) is communing with a set of imaginary playmates -- three princesses and a queen -- who offer insider stock tips that never fail. (Is this sort of information legal when its delivered by a childs made-up companions? The movie never says.) At that point Murphy really starts to act up. To retrieve the tips he must play along with his daughter by pretending to visit her friends in their fairy kingdom. This requires him to explore for the first time his parental imagination; it requires him to have fun with his child. Imagine That is a benignly didactic kiddie movie that at once benefits from and gets buried under Eddie Murphys skittery overeager inflections. He can often be a bit much like his idol Jerry Lewis. That said theres something sweet about the way that Murphy throws himself into this piffle. Thomas Haden Church does too as Murphys rival a corporatized Native American who talks about finance in fake-Indian gobbledygook. At times he almost makes sense.

Adding to his pressures is the meteoric rise of a co-worker shtick Native American ""Whitefeather"" whose financial consultations come couched in pseudo-mysticism and PowerPoint razzle-dazzle (played by Thomas Haden Church fitfully amusing with characterization and makeup owing much to Phil Hartmans SNL Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer). Evans interest in parent-child bonding spikes when Olivia becomes a medium for clairvoyant insights into international business trends via her imaginary friends. On the surface the idea of combining Bloomberg Terminals market jargon and childish fancy seems counterintuitive. Thats because it is. But Imagine That does manage to get a crowd tearing up on cue for its emotional climax; as much as it works its through the personal charm of Murphy and Shahidi. Strikes against include god-awful Beatles covers over-reliance on the hilarity of grown-ups in suits saying ""poop"" and obtrusive Red Bull product placement--the beverage company may as well start producing films itself after this and Yes Man. If memory serves kiddies like whatever movie you drop them off at but for the record Drop Dead Fred remains the vastly superior film.

Arguably the most innocuous pic of Eddie Murphys career to date ""Imagine That"" is an undemandingly pleasant mildly amusing fantasy in which nothing -- not even those elements that actually define it as a fantasy -- is ever allowed to get of hand. Arriving amid the summertime cavalcade of comedies suffused with raunchy tomfoolery it may be greeted as a godsend by parents who want to spend an afternoon at the megaplex with their preteen daughters. Its difficult to imagine however that this PG-rated Paramount/Nickelodeon presentation will draw many ticketbuyers outside that narrow (albeit potentially profitable) niche. The latest in a seemingly endless line of sentimental laffers about stressed-for-success dads who reconnect with their neglected kids ""Imagine That"" finds Murphy working in a very engaging but atypically understated mode. Indeed even on those occasions when his character Denver-based financial manager Evan Danielson engages in some spirited comic riffing -- silly voices prancy dancing -- his behavior seems no more manic than the everyday horseplay of a father interacting with a young child. Unfortunately Evan has been too wrapped up in his job to spend much quality time with his young daughter Olivia (Yara Shahidi). His estranged wife (Nicole Ari Parker) more or less forces their child on him for a week of bonding but Evan finds little time in his overcrowded schedule to be a dutiful dad. Little wonder then that Olivia seeks companionship with invisible playmates in an imaginary world. Evan is annoyed by Olivias propensity for make-believe -- until the invisible playmates start to provide through Olivia exceptionally prescient investment advice. Before long Evan is a supernova at the investment firm where his soon-to-retire boss (Ronny Cox) is seeking a successor. The other candidate is Johnny Whitefeather (Thomas Haden Church) a self-styled mystic whose Zen-like affectations and faux-Native American gobbledygook barely disguise his ruthlessly competitive streak. Making his live-action directing debut after scoring with ""Over the Hedge"" helmer Karey Kirkpatrick (who also helped write the recent films of ""Charlottes Web"" and ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"") takes a surprisingly naturalistic approach to the fantastical aspects of the script by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson. Rather than rely on CGI animatronics or other f/x trickery he presents Olivias invisible playmates as -- well invisible. In fact Evan (and the audience) must rely on Olivia to describe the specifics of her fantasy world; all the viewer ever gets to see or hear is father and daughter conversing and capering in Evans lavishly appointed apartment and a few outdoor locations. For those who remain immune to the pics low-key charms the extended segments of ""Lets Pretend"" will seem between unremarkable and silly. But its just as likely that parents and their young offspring will be enchanted by those scenes in which the only special effect is the warm chemistry generated between sly pro Murphy and charming newcomer Shahidi. Churchs transparent phony-baloney act as Whitefeather is the only thing here that approaches overstatement but the actor is sufficiently deft to stay just this side of caricature. Its not his fault that the character itself will be viewed by some as borderline offensive an impression not entirely dispelled when his Native American roots are revealed as extremely shallow. The filmmakers generate so much goodwill throughout ""Imagine That"" that its genuinely disappointing when they fall back on the crisis of conscience that develops when a protagonist must choose between attending an important business meeting or being in the audience when his child takes part in some activity that just happens to be scheduled at the same time. Outstanding contributions by production designer William Arnold and lenser John Lindley go a long way toward establishing a believable workaday world where fathers and daughters can make their own magic with flights of imagination. Aptly chosen covers of Beatles songs are adroitly mixed into the soundtrack.
