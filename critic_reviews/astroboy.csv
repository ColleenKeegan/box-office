The digitally drawn characters never seem to manage eye contact the dialogue is mechanical and the nods to Disney (shades of Pinocchio) to Miyazaki (shades of Laputa Castle in the Sky) and Brad Bird (The Iron Giant) are just that nods.An origin tale Astro Boy directed by David Bowers is set in futuristic Metro City a floating utopia where robots perform the servile functions and where Dr. Tenma (the voice of Nicolas Cage) is deep into weapons research involving ""blue core"" (good) and ""red core"" (bad) energy. Unfortunately things go awry down at the lab and Tenmas brainy bratty son Toby (the voice of Freddie Highmore) is right in the middle of the awry-ness.Dead boy he is only to be (sort of) resurrected as a super-powered bot with big round eyes and two pyramidical oil-slick cowlicks. Tenma doesnt know about Toby/Astro Boy at first but he doesnt seem that grief-stricken about the loss of his son either. Hes too busy dealing with the megalomaniacal Stone (Donald Sutherland) a cynical politician hungry for power.Astro meets up with a gang of Earth orphans living with Hamegg (Nathan Lane) a pervy coot who has a bit of Dickens Fagin about him - and who makes his living staging robot battles for a hungry public. None of the other kids including cute tween-y Cora (Kristen Bell) suspect that Astro isnt human but they find out soon enough when he comes to the defense of the exploited metal machines.There are tiny glints of humor and intelligence at work (a books cover reads Descartes Before the Horse) and the action and animation rockets along slickly and stylishly. (Theres also a Transformers-esque battle scene.) But unlike the protagonists of almost any and all of the Pixar titles Astro Boys namesake lacks even an iota of soul.Astro Boy  (out of four stars)Directed by David Bowers.

"Astro Boy Movie review of Astro Boy by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Astro Boy -- 2 out of 5 stars Zog (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) and Astro Boy (voiced by Freddie Highmore) Summit Entertainment Summit Entertainment Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Lovely dollops of wit and warmth float through the big screen version of Astro Boy the latest Japanese TV cartoon to make it to the big screen. But the look themes and slam-bang Transformers violence of that 1960s animated series make this every bit as dated as Speed Racer even if it is easier to watch.Its about a Pinocchio with rocket engines for legs x-ray eyes and a swirly just-got-dunked-in-the-toilet hairdo. Like that little wooden puppet Astro Boy greets the world with an open heart. He was built to replace a lost son by the boys scientist/father. Dad (voiced by Nicolas Cage) made him indestructible so that he would never ""lose him again."" But dad has changed his mind. ""Whats wrong with me?""""Youre not Toby. Youre just a copy."" The kid (Freddie Highmore) is discarded like every other robot in robot-happy Metro City which hovers over littered polluted planet Earth. Astro meets the surface dwellers young Oliver Twist orphans ( Kristen Bell voices one) who scrounge busted robots for the Fagin-like Ham Egg ( Nathan Lane). Astro competes in the arena brawls of the Robot Games falls in with the comical Robot Revolutionary Front and becomes a pawn in the Metro City presidents cynical plans to start a war with the surface dwellers just so he ( Donald Sutherland) can win re-election.""Its NOT time for change"" is his campaign slogan.Director David Bowers was an artist on Shark Tale Prince of Egypt and Wallace amp; Gromit so he gets the look right. A subversive streak in the script means that empathy and the dangers of warmongering and disposable consumerism arent all kids will learn. Will they pick up the Lenin posters in the Robot Revolutionary Fronts hideout references to the classic horror film Freaks (""One of us one of us"") Asimovs Laws of Robotics the writings of Descartes and Kant and the inventions of DaVinci?None of those keep this thinly-plotted cartoon from sagging. An all-star voice cast is almost always a give-away that the movie isnt all that and Astro Boy wastes Charlize Theron and Samuel L. Jackson in bit vocal parts. As Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs proved the animation bar has been raised and not just by Pixar. Poor little Astro Boy hasnt a prayer of clearing it.Astro Boy Two of five starsCast The voices of Freddie Highmore Nicolas Cage Kristen Bell Nathan Lane Donald SutherlandDirector David BowersRunning time 1 hour 33 minutesIndustry rating PG for some action and peril and brief mild language.

Set in the floating future world of Metro City its the story of a young boy (Freddie Highmore) accidentally vaporised in an industrial accident only to be rebuilt as a miniature robot gunship by his scientist father (Nicolas Cage). Donald Sutherland lends his voice to ultra-right-wing demagogue President Stone who lusts for state-of-the-art firepower while spouting militarist buzzwords and allowing the audience to ally with the now-shunned Astro Boy and his new cadre of plucky outcasts. While far from an unmitigated disaster Bowerss play-it-straight attitude towards the material combined with the crisp if unspectacular animation doesnt allow Astro Boy a moment to bob its head above the ever-swelling digimation pack. Though it may pass muster with the very wee ones.

(Freestyle Releasing) BY Elizabeth Weitzman Joe Neumaier DAILY NEWS FILM CRITICS Thursday October 22 2009 320 PM Motherhood1 starA harried Manhattan mom deals with family demands. At area theaters (133). PG13 Language.Familiarity didnt breed contempt for writer-director Katherine Dieckmann though her film ""Motherhood"" still plays as if too many in-my-life moments wore it down to the point of monotony. As a checklist of stressors facing New York parents everything seems accounted for Eliza (Uma Thurman glammed down but ever lovely) a frenzied West Village mom of two juggles her young son and a distracted husband (Anthony Edwards) while planning her daughters sixth birthday all while maintaining her mommy blog (topical). Yet unfortunately nothing here digs too deep. Eliza yearns to say something about the place she finds herself and aches to maintain her sense of self but ""Motherhoods"" litany of complaints and trite comedy-drama comes off as thin and targeted as a flyer for The Childrens Place. Joe NeumaierAstro Boy2 starsAnimated adventure about the 1960s superkid. At area theaters (134). PG Violence disturbing themes. David Bowers retro-cool update on the titular icon looks so great it may take a while to notice its a clunky political parable wrapped in a tonally confused fairy tale.Bowers does stay true to the original story in which a scientist (a bored-sounding Nicolas Cage) replaces his deceased son with a humanoid robot (Freddie Highmore) and then coldly rejects the clone. But the once-futuristic plot feels creaky today and theres something pretty disturbing about a kid flick in which the young hero dies several tragic deaths and gets repeatedly resurrected. The animation perfectly evokes the cartoon you remember. But the central conflict between a war-mongering ""red"" President (Donald Sutherland) and the peace-loving ""blue"" scientists is drawn as bluntly as Astro Boys simplistic design.    Elizabeth WeitzmanOng Bak 2 The Beginning2 starsMartial arts adventure set in ancient Thailand. At the Village East (138). R Violence.  Given that ""Ong Bak 2"" has virtually nothing to do with its predecessor we cant explain its name. But we can tell you whether to see or skip it. The criterion couldnt be simpler does a 20-minute martial arts battle featuring Thai superstar Tony Jaa sound like the ideal way to spend your time and money? If not move on. But if so you wont care about the halfhearted setting (feudal Thailand) or convoluted plot (Jaas guerrilla fighter trains to avenge his fathers death). Uma Thurman (center) and Anthony Edwards (right) celebrate their daughters birthday in Motherhood. (Summit Entertainment) Jaa who co-directs has only one thing in mind a series of increasingly complex fight scenes in his characteristically wide-ranging style. If movie theaters allowed you to fast-forward past the filler your life just might be complete. E.W.Antichrist 1 starAfter their child dies a couple face madness. With Willem Dafoe Charlotte Gainsbourg. At the IFC Center (149). Not rated Extreme nudity violence and sexuality. Artfully horrific but artificial and soulless Lars von Triers ""Antichrist"" arrives with buzz attached -- a Cannes screening that resulted in a Best Actress award for Charlotte Gainsbourg as well as reportedly sickened audiences. The reason for the first element is a mystery. Gainsbourgs performance as a nameless woman whose son dies because she was in the other room making love with her husband (Willem Dafoe amping up his croaky intensity) is raw yet sterile. The reason for the second is quite clear The couples grief as they isolate themselves in a cabin in the woods results in some ""Saw""-style torture and self-mutilation of the most intense nature. Von Trier (""Breaking the Waves"" ""Dogville"") has no barriers which absolutely can be a good thing. Here though his uninhibited nature is an omen of the pretentious butchery to come.   J.N.(Untitled) 2 starsSatire about the New York art world. At the Angelika (136). R Language nudity. Theres no easier target than bad art whether its empty affected or downright preposterous. In mistaking obvious observations for cutting insight writer-director Jonathan Parker becomes what he lampoons.Brothers Adrian (Adam Goldberg) and Josh (Eion Bailey) represent two sides of a cultural divide. Adrian composes painfully atonal music; Josh creates paintings so marketable theyre not considered actual art. Marley Shelton is the insufferable gallery owner in the middle and Zak Orth is a collector who blindly follows every trend.Because Parker is so determined to expose the art scenes pretensions he neglects other areas like dialogue plot and character. And whats the point in making a shallow satire about shallow subjects?E.W.

With the voices of Freddie Highmore and Nicolas Cage. Directed by David Bowers. (PG. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The kid has guns in his butt. No matter how many fancy words I use to describe Astro Boy (bathetic backstory heartbroken father multiple allusions to literature and film) it all comes down to the heat that explodes from his backside during a really big fight. Awesome. Truly. Rest assured Astro Boy is an android. Voiced by Freddie Highmore he looks and sounds like a real child - a boy named Toby who tragically expires in the first few scenes prompting his grief-stricken inventor dad (Nicolas Cage) to build a precise robotic simulacrum. In Osamu Tezukas classic manga and eventual cartoons Toby died in a car accident. In director David Bowers and writer Timothy Harris spangly spunky CG adaptation Astro Boy gets zapped into nothingness during a military demonstration overseen by an egomaniacal and war-mongering president (Donald Sutherland). The setting is Metro City an idyllic floating metropolis that hovers over the ugly remnants of a trashed planet Earth. But the citys occupants care not a whit for the scum below which Astro learns firsthand when he falls to Earth after Dad cruelly rejects him as a false boy. Wanting only to fit in the little robot runaway promptly hooks up with intrepid scavenging orphans (Kristen Bell Moises Arias) and a curiously named father-figure voiced by Nathan Lane. Meanwhile three amusing rust-bucket revolutionaries with London accents (among them Bill Nighy doubling as a scientist) are plotting to liberate their kind but they cant overcome the Laws of Robotics forbidding violence against humans. And at the end Astro Boy gets his chance to go literally and totally ballistic on a nasty metallic gargantua exploiting his many heroic abilities. Purists should have a field day enumerating the differences between the original ""Astro Boy"" and this high-gloss reimagining. Someone has to. His journey isnt easy a struggle he telegraphs with those massive eyes of his. As Toby says near the end ""I guess fitting in can be a lot more complicated than it seems huh?"" Especially with rifles in your tush. -- Advisory Some action and peril and brief mild language.

Jennie Punter From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 22 2009 306PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Astro Boy Directed by David Bowers Screenplay by Timothy Hyde Harris and David Bowers Starring the voices of Freddie Highmore Kristen Bell Nathan Lane Eugene Levy Bill Nighy Donald Sutherland Charlize Theron and Nicolas Cage Classification PG In the days when TV cartoons werent available 24/7 kids lived for Saturday mornings and Bugs Bunny. But in the mid-1960s something quite different started showing upon the dial - the saucer-eyed characters and captivatingly odd stories of Japanese anime. The new CGI-animated feature Astro Boy is based on the first Japanese animated show to hit North American sets. And while it probably wont satisfy die-hard anime junkies it should awaken nostalgia in parents of a certain vintage who caught the often bizarre adventures of a rocket-powered superhero robot kid way back when. Directed by Brit David Bowers ( Flushed Away ) and produced by Hong Kong CGI-animation house Imagi Studios (2007s TMNT ) Astro Boy is a well-oiled machine that hinges too much on story and visual elements that audiences will recognize from Pinocchio  Oliver Twist  Iron Giant  Wall-E and even Robocop . Despite its lack of originality though the family-friendly movie is smartly written brisk and fun and. As well it respects the spirit of the TV original which explored both racial tensions (robot servants versus human masters) and environmental issues. Astro Boy began as a manga created by legend Osamu Tezuka whose Mushi Studios produced three seasons of the TV show. Rejigged for audiences on this side of the Pacific Astro Boy was a hit and after the first run of its black-and-white episodes became one of the most popular syndicated series in the late 1960s disappearing around 1970 when colour became a must. ( Astro Boy was reincarnated for shorter-run TV series in the 1980s and again this decade.) Nicolas Cage a fan of the first series tried unsuccessfully to get a live-action movie project rolling over the years. He gets a piece of the action in Astro Boy  voicing Dr. Tenna a top scientist and single dad who lives with his gifted son the spiky-haired Toby (Freddie Highmore) in Metro City an urban oasis floating above garbage-strewn Earth. After Toby dies during a weapons-test accident Dr. Tenna channels his sorrow into building an android look-alike equipped with lots of handy weaponry and holding Tobys memories. Tenna powers the kid with ""blue core"" a newly discovered source of powerful positive energy that villainous war-monger President Stone (Donald Sutherland) wants to insert in a new robot weapon. Robot Toby learns hes not a real boy when his father-creator rejects him after catching him cavorting with the robot help. The kid eludes capture by the Presidents drones and crashes to Earth where a band of revolutionary robots try to recruit him into their liberation movement. But Astro as he now calls himself prefers to hide the truth of his inner circuitry and hang out with a bunch of rag-tag human orphans who scavenge robot scraps for the Fagin-like Hamegg (Nathan Lane). Astro has a knack for reviving robots and becomes the star of the gang. But when he discovers the rebooted robots are simply being used as gladiators - not to mention that Hamegg has his number - Astro can no longer hide his true identity and a superhero emerges from the rubble. Astro Boy definitely sets himself up for a sequel and the overall scenario is ripe to explore many current issues. But lets hope the creators trade in the well-used parts for some fresh material.

Comments click to enlarge Astro Boy Video Rated PG  94 minutes  2009 Osamu Tezukas groundbreaking 60s anime series gets a stylish CGI update in this sci-fi animation (2009). A scientist (given voice by Nicolas Cage) distraught over the death of his son (Freddie Highmore) re-creates the boy as a robot powered by a blue core of ""good"" energy. Like the series the film considers humanitys dependence on and fear of automation though this new treatment also has an apocalyptic theme as a craven politician foments war by harnessing the ""bad"" energy of a red core (a none-too-subtle allusion to American politics). The lighting production design and character modeling are excellent and director David Bowers (Flushed Away) references Frankenstein Wall-E Transformers and even Abraham and Isaac. But the TV series primitive though it was had a sweet innocence and joyfulness that made it more fun.

Astro Boy Fair to good Director David Bowers. Cast Freddie Highmore Nicolas Cage Kristen Bell. Rating PG for some action and peril and brief mild language. Related Animated movies Movies based on kids TV Geeky pop-culture interpretations often follow that pattern. Maybe thats how it will go with ""Astro Boy"" director David Bowers interpretation of the well-loved Japanese classic. Im the wrong person to ask. Im unfamiliar with the original comic television show the whole deal. I came to the film cold. Maybe thats a good thing because ""Astro Boy"" stands up just fine on its own no previous knowledge necessary. Covering more-serious fare than most kids movies (death rejection and betrayal are some topics addressed) ""Astro Boy"" nevertheless manages to be a lot of fun. It begins with Toby (voice of Freddie Highmore) in class in Metro City. It seems that the Earth became so polluted that leaders simply carved out a chunk and floated it above ground resulting in a robot-run paradise for its residents but a far lesser world for those living below. Toby is brilliant taking after his father Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage) a scientist who has created an innovative weapon for President Stone (Donald Sutherland) a hawkish sort who insists on jacking up the hostility level on Tenmas creation by giving it a heart powered by negative energy. Things go predictably awry so much so that Toby is killed. (Yes thats a different demise than in the original.) If that sounds like a spoiler its really not Astro Boy couldnt exist without Tobys death. Thats because hes a souped-up robot created by Tenma using DNA from Tobys hair and uploading Tobys memories to create a nearly perfect replica. Nearly perfect. Tenma cant shake the knowledge that this isnt really his son. After a series of misadventures in which he realizes what he really is Toby winds up on the Earths surface where hes befriended by a motley crew of orphans led by the plucky Cora (Kristen Bell). Dubbed Astro he must balance his true identity with his longing for inclusion and companionship with wanting to be part of a family. This isnt a simple family drama of course. Its an animated kids movie so a showdown is inevitable with lots of loud action. Its characterized in some regard by the anime tradition of rules seemingly changing at will (""Ive got machine guns - in my butt?"") but thats somewhat mitigated by Astros sense of wonderment and discovery at his own powers. The story borrows heavily from Pinocchio and you dont have to look too closely to spot other more recent influences on the film (""WALL-E"" springs most immediately to mind). It makes for a surprisingly rich experience lifting ""Astro Boy"" to greater heights than you might expect. Tenma wisely powers the boys heart with positive energy something that spreads to the movie as well. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Movie Review Interesting Journey for Astro Boy washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Astro Boy Movie Review Interesting Journey for Astro Boy (Courtesy Of Summit Entertainment - AP) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 23 2009 Is ""Astro Boy"" a glimpse of the future? Or a relic of the bygone past? On the one hand its inspired by the beloved 1960s television cartoon of the same name created by Japanese manga/anime icon Osamu Tezuka. On the other hand its hero is a pre-adolescent android in an Epcot Center-like world called Metro City that floats above an ecologically devastated Earth. The humans that live there are attended by a corps of menial slave-bots. Only theyre not the futuristic ""Blade Runner"" kind but the retro ""Lost in Space"" kind. They look like they were designed by Sears. Astro the movies mechanical-boy hero (Freddie Highmore) is different. ""Ive got machine guns"" he announces upon discovering one of his many high-tech accessories. ""In my butt"" If youve seen the commercials for the movie -- whose plot revolves around Astros struggle to liberate the robots negotiate peace between the residents of Earth and Metro City and square things with his estranged father-figure creator Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage) -- youve heard that line. And youve got your answer to the question at the top of this review. Despite its mid-20th-century pedigree and its sci-fi setting ""Astro Boy"" is almost defiantly a movie of today. While the film retains some of the DNA of the original TV series it bears more similarity to such recent fare as ""WallAE"" and ""Transformers."" In other words despite a sweetly ecological message it can get loud and moderately violent. True its machines that suffer the most damage but the film opens with the death of Tenmas son for whom Astro is a nuts-and-bolts surrogate. As for the films look the CGI animation shares the same Mr. Potato Head level of facial expression and stiff-limbed locomotion as ""Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius."" Good thing. Because at first nobody -- including the title character -- is exactly sure whether Astro is a real kid or not. His journey toward acceptance of both his robot nature (think guns in his butt) and his for lack of a better word humanity is the real story at the heart of ""Astro Boy."" It will put some viewers in mind of yet another story with the same theme ""Pinocchio.""  PG. At area theaters. Contains cartoon violence a couple of bits of bathroom humor and thematic material related to the death of a child. 95 minutes.

Attention parents Dont hate ""Astro Boy"" just because his giant image is embla zoned across the front of the Times Square Toys R Us. This computer-animated adaptation of the 1950s-created future boy from Osamu Tezuka the godfather of Japanese manga is actually a sweet and endearing movie. Attention kids Its also packed with action The action begins in Metro City a sort of Jetsons hometown on steroids which floats above a junk-strewn ""Wall-E""-like Earth. Its where government scientist Dr. Tenma (voiced by Nicolas Cage) builds and programs a robot replica of Toby the son he loses in a horrible accident. But the reconstituted kid doesnt know hes a robot -- until his father realizing the creation cant replace his flesh-and-blood son casts him out. But quicker than you can say ""inevitable sequel"" a Strangelovian President Stone (Donald Sutherland) demands the young robots ""blue core"" power source and sends out his warrior ""Peacekeeper"" robot to find him by any means necessary. Cue the chase scene in which young robot boy having discovered he has superpowers such as flying and flame-shooting ends up escaping by falling to Earth. Once there he falls in with a group of urchins under the charge of the Fagin-like Hamegg (an appropriately hammy Nathan Lane) who rebuilds trash-heap robots to compete at the Robot Games a battle-to-destruction that recalls Roman times. Fearing hell lose his new friends (including big-eyed waif Clara) Astro Boy -- as hes known now -- pretends to be human like them. Hamegg however isnt fooled and forces Astro into the Robot Games. Whats nice about ""Astro Boy"" which clocks in at a just-right 95 minutes is the little touches of humor sprinkled throughout. A funny side story involves three disheveled Brit-accented robots of the Robot Liberation Front a spoof on communists (a poster at their headquarters is for the Trotsky Quartet instead of the classical Brodsky Quartet). And Sutherlands President Stone who insists all his actions are ""a matter of national security"" cant understand his low approval ratings ""Ive cut taxes for a lot of very influential friends. I was popular in high school"" he whines. A destructive full-speed-ahead finale chase in Metro City recalls both ""The Incredibles"" and the old ""Godzilla"" movies. Astro Boy in his big-screen debut (there was an American TV cartoon in the early 60s) makes you want to root for him -- even if he does look a lot like Bobs Big Boy.

So the moguls gleefully rub their rough hands at the recent blooming of animated features into a reliable blockbuster genre. Anyone could have predicted that Pixars Up Blue Skys Ice Age 3 and DreamWorks Monsters vs Aliens would be among the years top-grossing pictures but who saw Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs coming? The success of Meatballs G-Force and Where the Wild Things Are underlines the movie industrys hope that in every jaded teen or wizened adult theres an inner child whose sense of wonder and spending money are waiting to be tapped. Into this crowded agora comes David Bowers Astro Boy an animated feature based on Osamu Tezukas 1951 manga series that spawned a TV cartoon series from the 60s. (I confess I never saw it because I was out doing stuff that decade.) The new version streamlined and Americanized but with animation from the Hong Kong company Imagi lacks the brand recognition of the big CGI studios but the movie has its charms. Its fun encyclopedically derivative and pretty darned affecting. (See TIMEs pictures ""Animated Movies Not Just for Kids."") Dr. Tenma (voiced by Nicolas Cage in noble-mopey mode) is the leading scientist in Metro City a floating utopia of the future where robots do most of the work for humans. Tenma is devoted to his son Toby (Freddie Highmore of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) a boy genius whos also a nice kid. When Metro Citys nasty mayor Stone (Donald Sutherland) insists on activating a kind of death ray Toby wanders into the lab and is killed. His grieving father creates a robot version of Toby -- same DNA but with cool extras like propellant flames in his shoes and machine guns in his butt. Rejected by his father Toby escapes Metro City and lands on the grungy surface of earth where children are enslaved by the cheerfully malicious Ham Egg (Nathan Lane) and an underclass of humans and robots are forced into gladiatorial slam downs. Can Toby survive this environment save his new friends return to Metro City and win his fathers love? (Spoiler alert Yes four times.) You will recognized the storys reverberations of familiar mythic characters Frankenstein Pinocchio and Jesus. Plus the old Philip K. Dick premise of a man who doesnt know hes a cyborg that Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg borrowed for A.I. Artificial Intelligence and which showed up this year in Moon and Surrogates. Plus the literal underclass and upper-class strata of WALLE. And not to forget the bereft father twisted by family tragedy from last weeks Law Abiding Citizen. ""If you lose your son like this"" a fellow scientist tells Dr. Tenma ""and you dont go crazy youre not a human being."" Tenma doesnt plot the ingenious murders of everyone in Metro City the way the father does in Law Abiding Citizen; he simply and more plausibly averts his heart from the child he has created because this Toby is so close to the real Toby as to be both painful reminder and a cruel mockery. (See the top 10 voices of Pixar.) To itemize these elements isnt to say they cant be powerful. Maybe all stories are just one story with the common themes of love and loss art and adventure death and resurrection. These are the threads from which Astro Boy weaves its coherent imaginary world. The gravity of grief carries Tenmas character through the story; the robot Tobys need to prove himself to his dad and himself turns him into a superior being the best of both species. Ham Egg the exploiter of children down on earth is a little bit Fagin a little bit Stromboli from the Disney Pinocchio and a whole lot rotten; but thanks to Lanes vocalizing he has enough vaudeville swank and showmanship to make him an irresistible cartoon villain. (The same cant be said for Sutherlands mayor a one-note sociopath who risks Metro Citys very existence in order to get re-elected. Why doesnt he just rig the ballot boxes like any normal despot?) Director and co-writer Bowers worked at Aardman Films under Nick Park (of Wallace and Gromit glory) and directed Flushed Away that uneasy alliance of the gnome-artisans at Aardman and the brasher gang at DreamWorks. What both outfits stress is telling stories through characters and Bowers (along with co-writer Timothy Hyde Harris) breathe a solid emotional life into Toby and Tenma while adhering to the confines of a kid-oriented feature. The animation style is supple and assured. And if the audience includes any precocious kids like Toby theyll be diverted by references to Isaac Asimov and Immanuel Kant. Any purely reasoned critique of Astro Boy would note that it does not advance the art of animation and that some of its humor stabs miss their mark. But Bowers knows how to infuse emotion without just ladling it out in Act III; it is at the core of the story as Astro Toby teaches his father the verities of love heroism and family feeling. The little robot has a strong generous heart and so does this movie. See Times top 10 movies of 2008. See TIMEs Pictures of the Week.

Astro Boy Suspended animation | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAstro Boy Suspended animationA pioneering example of Japanese anime gets a Hollywood retrofit with less-than-dazzling results in Astro Boy .Astro Boy began as a pioneering example of Japanese anime in the 1960s and 70s. The American remake though true to the original narrative lacks flair.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarFri. Oct. 23 2009Featuring the voices of Freddie Highmore Nicolas Cage Eugene Levy and Kristen Bell. Directed by David Bowers. 94 minutes. At major theatres. PGA pioneering example of Japanese anime gets a Hollywood retrofit with less-than-dazzling results in Astro Boy. While Osamu Tezukas much-cherished android adolescent is given the respect hes due from director David Bowers and the impressive cast of stars who voice the characters the lacklustre design and rudimentary storytelling sink Astro Boy below the level of the recent hits of Pixar and DreamWorks. Conceived by Tezuka as a sort of space-age Pinocchio the character made his debut in a Japanese manga in 1952 before coming to television in 1963. The English-language version was a fixture of kids TV programming in the late 60s and early 70s and fans will be relieved that the filmmakers have not taken great liberties with the characters origins. Article Continued BelowBefore there was an Astro Boy there was a boy named Atom the precocious son of Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage) the brilliant head of the Institute of Science. They live in a futuristic Metro City that floats above the surface of the Earth which now serves as a scrap heap for discarded robots. When an experiment involving highly volatile balls of energy goes awry Atom is vaporized. Wracked by grief Dr. Tenma is driven to recreate his son in robot form. There are certainly shades of Dr. Frankenstein here but that isnt the cultural reference. Like Tezuka the filmmakers align the scientist with 17th-century philosopher Rene Descartes who is said to have built a mechanical doll to replace his deceased daughter.Since the synthetic lad has been equipped with Atoms personality and memories Astro Boy is initially unaware of his true nature. His resurrection is the cause of much consternation to his servant robot Orrin (Eugene Levy) and concern to Dr. Tenmas colleague Dr. Elefun (Bill Nighy). The situation worsens when Dr. Tenma realizes he cant accept this flying spike-haired contraption in place of the son he lost. Heartbroken (or at least chip-broken) over the rejection Astro Boy ends up on Earth. As he copes with his newly treacherous circumstances he is unsure whether to align himself with the sentient machines he encounters there or with the motley crew of human kids who work for Ham Egg (Nathan Lee) an unscrupulous scrap dealer. Naturally the confused droid is swayed by his burgeoning friendship with Cora (Kristen Bell) a fellow refugee from Metro City.Meanwhile the Draconian general who runs Metro City (Donald Sutherland) is desperate to get his hands on the ball of energy that powers Astro Boy. A drab blowhard this villain is symptomatic of the sluggish unsatisfactory storyline that takes over once the movie has re-established the essential elements of the characters mythology.The second half devolves into the usual orgy of destruction with the films many action sequences feeling distinctly second-hand. Recycling bits and pieces of fellow CGI toons like so much scrap metal Astro Boy is a visual hodgepodge of WALLE The Iron Giant The Incredibles and Robots. And despite a few references to Tezukas original designs the movie generally avoids the look of 60s anime as well as the slicker more vanguard sensibility of recent anime features like Vexille.The bland storytelling and generic appearance are especially unfortunate given the obvious reverence that Astro Boys makers have for the source material. Unfortunately their retelling of Tezukas tale has no sparkplug.

ABOUT THE MOVIEAstro Boy  (out of four)Voices Freddie Highmore Kristen Bell Nicolas Cage Nathan Lane Eugene Levy Donald Sutherland Bill NighyDirector David BowersDistributor Summit EntertainmentRating PG for some action and peril and brief mild languageRunning time 1 hour 34 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Astro Boy feels as if it were cobbled together from extraneous parts. Borrowing from Pinocchio The Incredibles Jimmy Neutron Iron Giant and even a bit of WALLE this CG-animated adaptation of the Japanese comic classic feels derivative but moderately entertaining particularly in some of the highflying visuals. The voice talent is snappy and there are some funny one-liners from Nathan Lane Bill Nighy Kristen Bell and Donald Sutherland. VIDEO Watch the trailer The character made his debut in 1951 in a manga (Japanese comic book) by Osamu Tezuka and spawned his first TV series in Japan in 1963. The film is set in the gleaming futuristic world of Metro City a metropolis floating in the sky. Robots work in servitude for humans. Young Toby (Freddie Highmore) is following in the footsteps of his scientist father Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage). After Toby is killed in an accident his grieving father creates a robot later dubbed Astro to replace his son. Astro (also Highmore) thinks hes a real boy and is shattered when his father rejects him. As it turns out he was made with ""blue"" energy a potent source of good which the warmongering president (Sutherland) seeks to control the world. So with the president and the military after him Astro flies off and crashes to Earth. There he meets a group of orphan children and passes himself off as a boy. Some of the movies better moments involve the friendship between Astro and the spunky Cora (Bell). But their wily leader Hamegg (Lane) recognizes Astro as a robot and concocts nefarious plans. After some action-packed struggles Astros essential goodness conquers all. The action sequences trump the story and its flashes of comedy. Director David Bowers (Flushed Away) touches awkwardly on some tough emotional material. The exploitation of robots is shown but their ill treatment is glossed over. Though some scenes may be too intense for children the action is slick with robot clashes and airborne chases leaving the strongest impression.

BOTTOM LINE ""Astro"" boys and girls will be very very young audiences. Boomers beware. CAST Voices of Freddie Highmore Nicolas Cage Donald Sutherland Bill Nighy Kristen Bell Nathan Lane Samuel L. Jackson LENGTH 134 Appropriately perhaps theres something robotic about ""Astro Boy"" the computer-animated feature based on the 1960s Japanese series that was the first anime on U.S. TV. Creator Osamu Tezukas streamlined saucer-eyed vision drew in baby boomers with its off-kilter quality and the rat-a-tat dialogue of English vocal artists dubbing at Japanese-language pace. Astro Boy himself - an android Pinocchio - proved enticing What would it be like to be a kid robot? Cool But ""Astro Boy"" the movie is strictly for small fry. The fleshy foamy CGI makes characters look like plush toys - theres no attempt at the anime aesthetic - giving scenes that should feel exhilarating like Astro Boy (voiced by Freddie Highmore) learning that he can fly all the impact of a soft landing. advertisement | advertise on newsday Following the surprisingly harrowing death of scientist Dr. Tenmas son Toby Tenma (Nicolas Cage) builds a robot replica replete with memories. After Tenma rapidly disowns him robot Toby chased by the villainous President Stone (Donald Sutherland) falls from the floating Metro City to the garbage-strewn ghetto of the surface world. There the Fagin-like Hamegg (Nathan Lane) and a group of orphans take him in. A comic subplot with the Three Stooges-like Robert Revolutionary Front gives him the new name Astro. Cages voice work as Tenma is all tossed-off flatness and while Bill Nighy gives care and humanity to colleague Dr. Elefun even he cant save such dead-weight lines as ""Everyone has their destiny."" Sutherlands ignorant warmongering president is a plodding caricature not helped by the hammered-home symbolism of ""blue core"" / ""red core"" positive and negative energy sources. At least the animators got rid of the long eyelashes that made the original Astro look creepily like Betty Boop.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + A new ""Astro Boy? Why not? If the movies can bring Alvin and the Chipmunks back from the pop-culture dead whats wrong with digitally reviving a character who deserves a second career? Especially when the results are as promising if as bizarrely conflicted as this.The movie actually represents the third iteration more or less of the superhero rocket-boy. While most Americans of a certain age remember the animated TV episodes that ran in syndication from 1963 until the sprockets wore out in the early 1970s ""Astro Boy originated in a 1951 Japanese comic book by Osamu Tezuka the founder of the wide-eyed manga style that now overruns the earth. There have been two other TV versions (1980 and 2003) but the original manga (since translated into English and highly recommended) and the black-and-white TV show are Astro Boys twin power sources.The new movie lifts off from Tezuka and is all the more interestingly weird for it. Set in Metro City an airborne island paradise hovering high above a ruined Earth ""Astro Boy at first seems a fusion of ""WALL-E ""I Robot ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence and one of Hayao Miyazakis high-flying fables. Robots of all shapes and kinds serve mankind and their inventor Dr. Tenma (voiced by Nicolas Cage) is about to unveil his greatest cyborg yet a peaceful warrior fueled by blue-core energy from outer space.Metro Citys hawkish leader General Stone (Donald Sutherland having a ball) wants to use the malevolent red-core energy instead and in the ensuing dust-up Tenmas young son Toby (Freddie Highmore) is accidentally killed. The grief-crazed father hits the lab and invents a robot in his childs image then spurns it for not being enough like Toby. Exiled Astro Boy (Highmore again working that American accent) embarks on a quest to find his identity and/or locate the machine guns in his butt.OK then Its ""Pinocchio with a metaphysical twist the tale of a puppet who already was a real boy and will never be again. Grounded in this primal origin-story angst ""Astro Boy alternately soars and sputters through a story line thats not quite sure who its aimed at.For instance Director/co-writer David Bowers is formerly of Nick Parks Aardman Animations and theres a trio of googly-eyed revolutionary robots that could have come from a ""Wallace amp; Gromit short by way of Monty Python. The second credited screenwriter though is Hollywood vet Timothy Harris (""Trading Places ""Kindergarten Cop) which probably explains the dully cliched subplot in which Astro Boy falls to Earth and meets a group of Lost Boys (and one teen Lost Girl who looks like a Bratz doll and is voiced by Kristen Bell). The computer animation rendered by the Hong Kong-based Imagi Animation has a pleasing pastel simplicity that sometimes looks iconic and other times just cheap.The movie comments in its cartoon way on fascism our throwaway culture and the mistreatment of minorities (the minority being robots) but it also - and this is critical - delivers enough of the action movie goods to make your inner 8-year-old say ""wicked awesome at least three or four times. Can that alone restart a franchise? Can ""Astro Boy break free of the tentacles of the past and soar into tomorrow? Probably not - but stay tuned anyway.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Maybe childrens films should all get double review grades one for kids and another for their parents and guardians. Patronizing as that sounds movies like the 2009 CGI updating of Osamu Tezukas manga/anime classic Astro Boy make it achingly clear that different generations wont see the same film. Young audiences will get a slick exciting well-animated adventure with a neat child-robot protagonist who gets drawn into city-smashing battles. Older viewers are more likely to see a muddled film full of one-dimensional characters and insultingly strident politics. The latter start with a ball of space energy claimed by Metro City a shiny futuristic utopia that hovers above the clouds dumping trash on the suffering ground-dwellers below. (The giant garbage heaps the enclave of spoiled elitists and the chipper intro that explains them strongly recall their better-realized counterparts in Wall-E.) The scientist Dr. Elefun (Bill Nighy) splits the energy into two parts positive pro-environment happy blue energy and negative unpredictable destructive red energy. For those who dont follow the metaphor the film underlines it When Metro City creator Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage) develops a new security robot evil military politician General Stone (Donald Sutherland) commandeers the red energy to power it claiming incongruously that his chosen voters are those who like evil redness. The robot promptly runs amuck killing Dr. Tenmas son Toby. In a fit of grief and denial Tenma creates a high-powered robot duplicate. From there the plot stays in motion via a series of baffling implausibilities as General Stone Tenma and the robot Astro all make ridiculous choices that the script doesnt bother trying to justify. The poor writing does give Astro Boy a certain unpredictable thrill Since the characters arent consistent or remotely sensible theres no limit to where the story might go. But the films soppy sentimental tone asks viewers to get emotionally involved even though Stone is a cheap caricature Tenma never makes any sense and even Astro reverses his high-minded morals in an instant for the sake of an action sequence. Director David Bowers (Flushed Away) is seemingly a Tezuka fan given the films visual fidelity to his art and all the little Easter-egg Tezuka references sprinkled throughout for adult fans. But his script (co-written with Timothy Harris) is weak clunky and lazy. Tezuka was fantastically prolific over the course of his much-celebrated life; amid all his stories surely they could have located one that was better than their insulting re-imagining.

Astro as he comes to be known doesnt just look like Toby; he has the exact same personality (theyre both voiced by Freddie Highmore). You could chalk this up to the miracle ? of robotics -- or perhaps to the thinness of characterization that marks this jet-propelled update of the Japanese cartoon series which in 1963 was an early milestone of anime. If youre pining for the richness of a Pixar film or even for the crackerjack comedy of say Kung Fu Panda look elsewhere. Yet the new Astro Boy is a marvelously designed piece of cartoon kinetics with the pleasing soft colors and rounded-metal tactility of an atomic- age daydream. Astro gets kicked off Metro City a spaceship that hovers above Earth and he lands in a scrap heap of robots and meets some wild-child friends. Theres a little too much lost-boys-and-girls mopiness but when Astro becomes a robot gladiator the movie turns happy demolition derby and the virtuoso collisions just keep on coming.

Appropriately for a film about robots efficiency is the primary virtue of ""Astro Boy"" a well-oiled CG-animated superhero pic that makes up in competence and vitality what it lacks in originality. Adapted from the classic Japanese toon this thoroughly Westernized film will likely have little appeal to devotees of the source material instead targeting tots and borrowing from a variety of recent animated pics. Slated for an Oct. 23 release Stateside two weeks after opening in Asia the film easily should draw sizable family crowds and hold their attention well; whether it sticks in their memory is another question. The anxiety of influence is a palpable force in ""Astro Boy"" although it owes just as much to ""Wall-E"" ""The Iron Giant"" and ""Pinocchio"" as it does to its source -- Tezuka Osamus 1952 manga that spawned multiple cartoon series and bequeathed contemporary anime with a hefty chunk of its DNA. While ""Astro Boy"" is hardly the equal of any of those its nonetheless a cut above this years thematically and aesthetically similar ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" displaying flashes of intelligence and a relaxed pace that should please parents who stumbled out of the latter nursing stroboscopically induced migraines. Action centers around Toby (voiced by Freddie Highmore) a spiky-haired child prodigy who lives in futuristic Metro City a robot-controlled utopia orbiting high above the Earth which has become overrun with garbage. Following his scientist father Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage whose characteristically breathy marble-mouthed diction proves an odd fit for the character) to an experimental weapons test Toby is accidentally killed and the grieving Tenma creates an identical-looking android replacement complete with Tobys memories and consciousness (as well as the ability to fly and a cache of fearsome weaponry for reasons left unexplained). As detailed in a dapper retro-styled prologue Metro Citys sentient cyborgs are considered little more than disposable slaves and Tenma goes to lengths to hide Tobys internal circuitry from him. When he catches Toby fraternizing with the houses mechanical help however Tenma becomes disenchanted with his creation and cruelly sets the boy loose. Dropping down to Earth after an awkwardly timed battle with decidedly unscary supervillain President Stone (Donald Sutherland) Toby eventually falls in with a gang of orphaned scavengers who roam the ravaged surface seeking out scrap metal for their Fagin-like guardian (Nathan Lane). Now calling himself Astro the boy passes himself off as a fellow traveler and tries to go about fitting in soon discovering an ability to revive dead robots from the junkyard. Dark as all this sounds the PG-rated pics apocalyptic elements are more than balanced by its moments of levity and strong (though surprisingly subtle for a kidpic) moral undercurrents. The battle and chase scenes are kinetic and exciting without becoming too frightening or manic and theres little here to upset any but the smallest children. (That this film should merit a PG rating while last years far more sinister ""Tale of Despereaux"" skated by with a G defies all reason.) Script by director David Bowers and Timothy Hyde Harris is mercilessly streamlined in its storytelling and save for one very unexpected shout-out to Kant it refrains from aiming too many jokes above its target audiences heads. Supporting characters are well drawn particularly a band of robot revolutionaries plotting to overthrow their human overlords but hopelessly hampered by Asimovs first law of robotics. Animation is topnotch yet stylistically inconsistent veering from bubbly and Wii-like to photorealistic from scene to scene. Other tech contributions are solid all around with some excellent visual effects and sound design giving the action scenes extra punch.
