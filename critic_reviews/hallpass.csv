The Farrelly Brothers - coming off their misguided and borderline mean-spirited take on The Heartbreak Kid - try to make something like Theres Something About Everyone Besides Mary a mixture of middle-aged desperation and low-brow humor that rarely congeals into genuine hilarity. Rick and Fred (Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis) are respectively married to Maggie and Grace (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) but that doesnt stop them from gawking at every other woman that passes by as if they were single teens and not married thirty-somethings. The ladies decide to grant the guys a ""hall pass"" a week-long penalty-free pardon from the bounds of matrimony in order to serve as something of a sexual pressure valve. As a concept its laughable maybe even morally reprehensible though well-implemented in last years indie dramedy The Freebie. When the joke eventually becomes that these guys couldnt capitalize on their glorious ""Get Out of Marriage Free"" card if they tried the potential for laughs is there. Unfortunately the teenage mindset of our leads and their pals (including Stephen Merchant whose mid-credits epilogue is easily the films highlight) means that we get to watch Rick Fred and friends consume pot brownies on the golf course botch pick-up lines from the Internet and visit a massage parlor with all the tact of tenth-graders. The Farrellys cobble their antics together with poor ADR bad Photoshop work egregious product placement and a pair of shameless gross-out moments meant to evoke Marys most infamous gag that only come off as calculated attempts to elicit the same type of wild reaction at the expense of the relatively reasonable relationship concerns that drove Ben Stiller to do his dirty deed. The wives own experience with the hall pass brings a maudlin streak to the picture while Farrelly standby Richard Jenkins shows up as Coakley the unlikeliest of horndogs adding a slightly welcome air of sleaze to the proceedings. By the time everything comes to a head with a mad dash in a wrecked minivan only the semblance of a potentially raucous farce remains. The joke is supposed to be that its sad to see these guys so desperate for a lay but in truth its even sadder to see the brothers this desperate for a laugh. The Blu-ray transfer here fully conveys the films sitcom-level technical merits. An included extended cut of the film runs six minutes longer and hardly benefits from it (unless you relish a fleeting appearance by The Social Networks Armie Hammer as a club bouncer or the sight of Owen Wilson getting smothered by a python). Extras are limited to a single deleted scene involving Coakley bluffing his way out of a DUI (after yet another example of flagrant product placement) and a brief limp gag reel. I would hardly call the former ""outrageous"" or the latter ""hilarious"" but the text on the back cover insists as much.

Pictures release in theatres February 25 2011. Photo Credit Peter Iovino Photo/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two guys get a week of no-questions-asked freedom from their wives. BOTTOM LINE Another gross-out comedy from the Farrelly brothers made more repellent by unlikable characters CAST Owen Wilson Jason Sudeikis Jenna Fischer Christina Applegate LENGTH 145 Theres something about ""Hall Pass"" that feels grosser than the usual Farrelly brothers comedy. There is a joke involving an explosion of human diarrhea but its not nearly as off-putting as the films unlikable characters. ""Hall Pass"" stars Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis (""Saturday Night Live"") as Rick and Fred sex-starved middle-aged men married to the castrating manipulative mother-figures Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and Grace (Christina Applegate). On the advice of a therapist friend Dr. Lucy (Joy Behar) the wives decide to grant their dissatisfied husbands a hall pass - one week off from the constraints of marriage no questions asked. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? The ladies are betting that their flabby fellas will realize how low their stock has dropped on the singles market but Rick and Fred immediately begin hunting down some meaningless sex. They get off to a slow start (first stop for these out-of-practice suburbanites Applebees) but eventually meet their respective temptations in a curvaceous young barista (Nicky Whelan) and an aging party-girl (Kristin Carey). Wilson and Sudeikis engage in some hilariously crude banter but this film is angrier and more depressed than it realizes. In a moment of rare and painful honesty the henpecked Fred blurts out ""Doesnt it ever bother you that all our wives dreams come true and ours dont?"" Hes right. Rick and Fred are so unhappily married to such unsympathetic characters that the notion of a hall pass seems more tragic than comic. Even after the alls-well ending its unclear why Dr. Lucy didnt advise divorce. VideoHall Pass advertisement | advertise on newsday Back story Stars align for Hall Pass Owen Wilson says he was attracted to the ""Hall Pass"" script and the opportunity to work with directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly whose credits include ""Theres Something About Mary."" and ""Shallow Hal."" ""I read the script and I thought it was really funny"" he says. ""They said Jason [Sudeikis] was going to be in it and we started talking."" The filmmakers thought it would be funny to have Wilson who usually plays slick smooth-talking ladies men depict a guy who struggles to be noticed. They gave him a tacky wardrobe which Wilson abhorred. ""When youve got pleated jeans and these kind of orthopedic-type shoes you dont feel very sexy"" he says. Sudeikis saw an opportunity to star in a movie. He previously had supporting roles in ""Going the Distance"" ""What Happens in Vegas"" and other comedies. Fortunately he had an understanding boss in ""Saturday Night Live"" producer Lorne Michaels who offered him time off to take the gig last winter. It was worth the grueling pullingdouble duty but worth it according to Sudeikis. ""Id do the show Saturday fly to Atlanta  work Monday and Tuesday fly back to New York Tuesday night do the read-through Wednesday and fly back to Atlanta that night work on the movie Thursday then fly to New York on Friday do the show again on Saturday then repeat"" he recalls.

Fed up with their unruly husbands incessant girl-ogling and foul-mouthed hypothetical sex chats Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate let them off the marital leash for a week as a sly test to see if given the opportunity they would play away. And so we get the usual string of hackneyed and largely laugh-free set-ups involving vulgar chat-up lines hash brownies and a mad jealous guy with a crowbar all seemingly purpose-honed to appeal to devotees of The Hangover. Of course it descends into trite sentiment when all this laboured tom-catting makes the guys realise that hell they do love their wives.As with 2007s The Heartbreak Kid Hall Pass could be seen as another attempt by the Farrellys to inject some vague sub-Woody Allen intellectual rigour into their work attempting as it does a skewed take of the (reverse) psychology of married life. But frankly they were cleverer when they were making films for five year olds like Dumb amp; Dumber and Kingpin. The saving grace is a very amusing supporting role for Stephen Merchant as the obligatory nerdy member of this group of wannabe libertines. In fact the most baffling thing here is that the Farrellys have chosen to keep their A-material for a hilarious post-credit sketch that posits what would happen if Merchants character had been given a hall pass. Its so good it makes you think they may have made the wrong movie.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Dull Day at the Office Despite its loopy Philip K. Dick origins The Adjustment Bureau is as bland as a gray cubicle. By David Edelstein Published Feb 27 2011 ShareThis Damon and Blunt in The Adjustment Bureau.  (Photo Andrew Schwartz/Courtesy of Universal Pictures) If youre the type that wonders about Fate versus Free Will (Do we have fixed destinies? Are our lives in the hands of an invisible power?) then youll enjoy ruminating on the comic conceits of The Adjustment Bureau--perhaps during the movie to pass the time. Its based on a slender short story by that visionary paranoiac Philip K. Dick in which the notion that forces control our minds is treated farcically Were being directed not by sinister totalitarians but by blundering supernatural bureaucrats all under the direction of an unseen ""Old Man"" who labors to keep humankind on course. It must have seemed like a good fit for the first-time director George Nolfi who co-wrote the last Bourne picture and now casts Matt Damon as a formerly ambitious politician on the run from cosmic agents in fedoras clutching souped-up iPad-like slates who want to keep him from hooking up with his true love (Emily Blunt). But the result plays like Bourne Lite. Its too blandly whimsical to generate much suspense--or romance or comedy or religious uplift. What goes wrong? The bureau is staffed with characters played by good actors like John Slattery (dull-witted company man) Anthony Mackie (sympathetic ally) and Terence Stamp (scary mind-blanker) but none of them gets a chance to cut loose--and Mackie unfortunately evokes Will Smith as Damons magical New Age black caddie in the soul-curdling The Legend of Bagger Vance. It would have been better to use the talking dog from Dicks original story The movie needs more wisecracking animals or anything really that adds some razzle-dazzle. There is one lively CGI running gag doors that lead from office buildings to baseball stadiums to the Statue of Liberty--a supernatural ""substrate"" allowing Adjustment Bureau members to cruise around New York City. But Nolfi must have been trying to keep the story from getting bogged down with fancy effects--an excellent idea if thered been much of a story. Or more heat. The doughy Damon and aristocratic Blunt dont match up physically and they never get any Hepburn-Tracy rhythms going that might create some current. Hes supposedly an ex-ruffian who has lost an in-the-bag U.S. Senate election over a thoughtless bit of mooning. Shes a zany free-spirited ballet dancer who pops out of a stall in the mens room while hes rehearsing his rote concession speech and inspires him to ditch the platitudes and Tell It Like It Is. But Damon has no glad-handing spark and Blunt--though she moves like a dancer--seems too brainy to play this woman who suddenly turns into a passive ninny waiting for her knight to whisk her away. Why does the Adjustment Bureau want to keep Damon and Blunt apart? They have higher plans for him. But hed rather have the girl. And maybe its unfair maybe Im holding the picture to too high a standard but with all the horrors on the worlds horizon I hated this dope for his mulish dopey free will--especially given the lack of romantic chemistry The Adjustment Bureau is so annoying it made me think totalitarian mind control wouldnt be such a bad thing. The Farrelly Brothers comedy Hall Pass is often desperate often droopy. But I liked it--I like most of their films--for its blend of the cringeworthy and the compassionate. Theyve made a gross-out comedy about the perpetual immaturity of the American male that has amazingly enough a mature perspective. I did groan when I heard the premise which made me think the Farrellys were regressing. But its actually the male characters who long to regress. Married fortyish buddies Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis feel sexually deprived and live in a fantasy world prone to checking out passing young women while laughably trying to hide their interest. But their spouses (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) miss nothing. A psychologist (Joy Behar) says to give the boys a week off from marriage and let them get the wanderlust out of their systems a ""hall pass."" The idea is frankly creepy suggesting that middle-aged men sentenced to monogamy can go back to high school--which of course they cant even with ""permission."" Although youve never heard the words ""Farrellys"" and ""Eugene ONeill"" in the same sentence the film evokes the pathos of ONeills ""life lie""--here the idea that men in committed relationships need to believe its only their spouses who prevent them from scoring. For all the excretory penile and cunnilinguistic slapstick its the womens emotions that finally take center stage. On a hall pass themselves they like the attention of men. Then comes the grim realization that once more theyre objects in the psyches of creeps. When Hall Pass needs a shot of energy Richard Jenkins arrives as a self-professed love doctor a worldly hipster who analyzes the availability of women with the keen eye of Sherlock Holmes. But its Wilsons movie. For years dubbed ""the Butterscotch Stallion"" in racy tabloids he now sports thinning hair and slack muscles and his trademark spacey cool is tinged with regret. Its a terrific performance--and terrifying. Owen Wilson is aging Where goeth my own youth? The 2010 Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner was the Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakuls Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives a serenely fantastical tone poem in which the title character (Thanapat Saisaymar) slowly dying of kidney failure is visited by the spirits of his wife his long-lost son (transformed for some reason into a hairy beast) and other creatures from the twilight world--drawn to him were told because they ""sense his sickness."" Underscored by a low insistent rumble and the eerie calls of exotic birds Weerasethakuls shots of dark forest dense jungle vegetation and glowing-eyed creatures who gaze into the camera are layered and mysterious. But they can also be affectingly plain like the long static take in which the wifes ghost (looking ordinary and middle-aged as she did when she died) simply fades in and begins to speak. Savoring the last moments in his body saying good-bye to the world for now preparing for the trip to an ancient cave to begin his new journey Boonmee expresses one regret that he poisoned his karma by killing too many Communists. The universe is now fluid all boundaries dissolving all species interchangeable. (As if to prove this a woman welcomes a talking catfish between her legs.) Uncle Boonmee is entrancing--and also if youre not sufficiently steeped in its rhythms narcotizing. Truth to tell I wouldnt be surprised if a good percentage of its audience even at the Film Forum finds it excruciatingly boring. Adjust your biorhythms accordingly.

By Peter Rainer Film critic February 25 2011 Save for later Saved Jenna Fischer (l.) and Christina Applegate are shown in a scene from Hall Pass. Peter Iovino/Warner Bros./AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Peter and Bobby Farrelly are gross-out artists in transition. Like others of their ilk such as Kevin Smith and Judd Apatow they are moving warily into what passes for mellowing. What this means in practical terms is that in their new movie ""Hall Pass"" the Farrellys limit the extreme scatology sequences to a mere two.Owen Wilsons Rick and Jason Sudeikiss Fred are best friends whose roving eyes exasperate their wives. Ricks Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and Freds Grace (Christina Applegate) devise a solution Give the boys a ""hall pass"" - a one-time-only week off from their marriages during which in order to get the wanderlust out of their system once and for all they have permission to do whatever they want with whomever they want. The wives in the meantime go on vacation where they encounter a college baseball team replete with studs.Wilson has a gawky affability here that helps redeem much that might otherwise seem tasteless (as opposed to tasteless-but-funny). His encounters with a willing Australian babe (Nicky Whelan) have a silly klutzy sweetness. As an example of just how far the Farrellys have mellowed consider also the scene in which Rick refuses to buy beer for his kids underage babysitter. This shocking turn of events would have been unthinkable back in the days of ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Theres Something About Mary."" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? But then again its always been true that the Farrellys as well as Apatow have always been closet family-values guys. Their movies despite the goony gross-outs inevitably stand up for the tried and true. If you think the roving hubbies in ""Hall Pass"" are going to bust up their marriages you just havent been paying attention.

Pictures Im Taking Mental Photographs Im Taking Mental Photographs Credit Warner Bros. Pictures Applebees Applebees Credit Warner Bros. Pictures Never let it be said that the butter-soft craniums of beer-swilling American man-children have gone unexplored in modern comedy. For creatures defined by such simple almost simian patterns of behavior -- the ogling the gorging the masturbation references the need to give and receive terrible poker-buddy advice the dead-eyed incomprehension of the opposite sex -- said man-children have been the driving force of so many many stories everything from commercials to Adam Sandler vehicles to movies by reliable hitmakers like Judd Apatow (The 40 Year Old Virgin Knocked Up) and Todd Phillips (Old School The Hangover). In other words Seth Rogen has found his historic moment. Now Peter and Bobby Farrelly the erstwhile gross-out kings of Kingpin and Theres Something About Mary fame have entered the game with Hall Pass a schlub comedy redeemed by their signature mix of crass humor and disarming sweetness. The Farrellys have spent the past decade struggling to get the balance right Their dicey romantic comedy Shallow Hal couldnt reconcile its fat jokes with its earnest message about inner beauty and they were precisely the wrong people to remake Elaine Mays The Heartbreak Kid a comedy of cruelty and ruthlessness that ran counter to their squishy sensibility. Hall Pass for its part has the sort of water-cooler premise that raises eyebrows and sells tickets. Like the million-dollar hook of Indecent Proposal the ""hall pass"" concept fits beautifully into a studio logline The wives of two middle-aged men grant them a weeklong break from marriage. The rationale? If theyre given the opportunity to work out their false nostalgia for bachelorhood then they wont grow to resent their wives for taking away their freedom. (And in this case to resent being tethered to hideous ogres like Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate.) Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis are funny together as Rick and Fred best buddies and eager beneficiaries of the titular gift. Having grown impatient with their leering and dirty jokes their wives played by Fischer and Applegate respectively have offered the ""hall pass"" as a smart gamble pegging their husbands as too weak to hunt gazelles on the Serengeti. As Rick and Fred spend their nights prowling suburban hot spots on the order of Applebees the women steal off to Cape Cod where they discover opportunities of their own. i Ultimately big-hearted Hall Pass nonetheless shortchanges its female leads -- Jenna Fischer (left) and Christina Applegate -- by giving them little room to flex their comedic muscles. Peter Iovino/Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Peter Iovino/Warner Bros. Ultimately big-hearted Hall Pass nonetheless shortchanges its female leads -- Jenna Fischer (left) and Christina Applegate -- by giving them little room to flex their comedic muscles. Peter Iovino/Warner Bros. Half the laughs in Hall Pass come from the fact that Wilson and Sudeikis simply look the part Pear-shaped and pasty cruising the scene in tucked-in button-downs and mothballed casual wear they seem defeated even before they start dusting off pick-up lines. If Rick and Fred were ever any good at scoring chicks those muscles have atrophied to such an extent that they need two or three days just to will themselves into action. Their reticence leads to some predictably juvenile comic situations but the Farrellys undercut the crude gags with reminders that these men are more committed to marriage than they know. As is typical with such bro comedies its the women who are underserved. Fischer and Applegate are both sitcom veterans with finely honed comic timing but Hall Pass reduces them to Marge Simpson types sighing at their husbands like disapproving moms. Dispatching their characters to the Cape to relive their own singlehood balances the equation and lets them live out the fantasy too but the Farrellys dont give them any jokes. Theyre far too timid -- which is an odd adjective to describe a movie featuring an explosive-diarrhea gag. Still the Farrellys have a distinct touch that carries their dubious premise across. They bring back the toilet humor of yore and make it shocking and funny again largely because they treat it so matter-of-factly; in this comedy being gross is just a part of life. Mostly though they have their hearts in the right place. They turn a nonsensical yarn about pardoned infidelities into a sneaky affirmation of the vows.

"Hall Pass review New Farrelly brothers movie is thoroughly misguided |       NJ.com comments Hall Pass review New Farrelly brothers movie is thoroughly misguided Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 25 2011 at 759 AM View/Post Comments Warner Bros. PicturesOwen Wilson and pals play bumbling buddies in the low-brow comedy ""Hall Pass."" Rick and Maggie have been married for a long time and Rick is starting to get restless. And Maggie is starting to notice -- particularly the way he looks at other women. Seems like the seven-year-itch is settling in. So Maggie decides to give her husband a seven-day chance to scratch it -- one week of recaptured no-excuses bachelorhood. No way is this going to end well. This is the story behind ""Hall Pass"" and its painfully contrived -- like a smuttier version of an old ""I Love Lucy"" script. (""The boys and the girls bet on which sex is more jealous"") Stretching it out to more than 100 minutes doesnt seem like a good idea. But then its been a long time since Bobby and Peter Farrelly had a good idea. The brothers hit in the 90s with ""Dumb and Dumber"" one of the first of the big gross-out comedies. They then followed it and refined it with the genuinely funny (and even raunchier) ""Theres Something About Mary"" and ""Shallow Hal."" These were schlubby-guy farces built around sentimental romances. They were date movies but with barf jokes. But then Judd Apatow took that formula to the next level with movies like ""Knocked Up."" The Farrellys started floundering with misfires like ""Stuck on You"" and ""The Heartbreak Kid."" Movie Review Hall Pass (R) Warner Bros. (105 min.) Directed by Bobby Farrelly Peter Farrelly. With Owen Wilson Jason Sudeikis. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains nudity sexual situations strong language violence and scatological ""humor."" Stephen Whittys Review ONE AND A HALF STARS ""Hall Pass"" is an obvious attempt to try to get that mojo back but -- just like Ricks attempts to relive his wild and crazy single days -- it wastes a lot of energy to very little effect. Star Owen Wilson -- dressed in a variety of ugly short-sleeved shirts his hair combed stiffly to one side -- looks nearly as uncomfortable as we feel. Jason Sudeikis is one-note obnoxious as his best friend who gets a similar ""hall pass"" dispensation from his wife. Of course -- irony alert -- it turns out the women (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) decide to take a marital break too. And end up enjoying their freedom a lot more than their husbands who mostly act like witless 13-year-olds. And the Farrellys know all about witless 13-year-olds. So the directors trot out the same things that always have made them laugh -- explosive diarrhea sexually voracious older women closeups of penises grown men who say things like ""I gotta take a poo."" There is one brief interesting idea when Richard Jenkins shows up as a leathery aging ""swinger"" -- the kind of guy who can probably still quote Hef with a straight face. But he only has two or three scenes before were back with the bathroom jokes. And theyre not very funny. Worse the films not even outrageous. Its just kind of vulgar and sad and proof -- following so fast on the heels of ""The Dilemma"" -- that it may be time to take a break from these slobby bromantic comedies. At least until the ""Hangover"" sequel.

Think of the body language. The other night at a screening of ""Hall Pass"" -- in which two husbands are allowed a week off from their marriages -- it meant ""You cant make me laugh."" You wont make me laugh. I resent that you havent made me laugh. And sigh I hate that I laughed once. At your most scatological gag in a cesspool of them no less. ""This is bull--- Im outta here"" says the African-American male friend that hapless guys in films like ""Hall Pass"" have lately acquired. Who else can speak if not truth to power the crudest observations to the wimpy? Still When he said it I was jealous. Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis play Rick and Fred who are married to Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and Grace (Christina Applegate). On the advice of their friend Dr. Judy (Joy Behar) the mates give their men an opportunity to stray. Its reverse psychology. What else can counter nice- enough Rick and naughtier Freds wanderlust (emphasis on lust) as effectively as the cold hard reality of being back in the hunt? The ladies leave Providence R.I. and their teenage sons -- er 30-something husbands -- for Cape Cod. Fred and Ricks week is full of false starts and misadventures. There are cannabis brownies and a clumsy visit to a massage parlor. There is awkward flirtation and something akin to a connection. Freds a dolt. Wilsons Rick treading the familiar is more honorable than not. Even so while his wife and two kids are away Rick gets slightly fluffed over a shapely barrista (Nicky Whelan) who has a gday accent and an overprotective co-worker. Proving just how good he is Richard Jenkins tan and sporting gold chains is even watchable as the fellas hound-dog friend Coakley. This unfunny ride is directed by Bobby and Peter Farelley brothers in life and comedy. Usually the tag team balances rude pleasures with something resembling heart. But ""Something about Mary"" seems a lifetime ago. Whatever the problem in ""Hall Pass"" the dumb is dumbered down. ""HALL PASS.""

The movie boasted a defibrillated dog a dab of hair gel that wasnt really hair gel and enough belly laughs to fill Jabba the Hut. It also had a sneaky sweetness and an overlooked underlying message Guys can be desperately pathetic creatures when it comes to the opposite sex.That was awhile ago. As Hall Pass arrives the Farrelly magic has been through a wringer of imitations (including some by the brothers) and an era of extremity that make honest gleeful outrage hard to conjure. Yet Hall Pass has moments that remind us who were dealing with. The feckless husbands (Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis) granted a week off from marriage are just as clueless as the stalkers that stumble through Mary. Even if the Farrellys can still show a similar desperation with the graphic gags theres no denying the laughs are there.The central gimmick is far-fetched but ripe for payoff Wives (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate) sick of their husbands distracted gawking give the guys a short window of freedom . The guys off their game and out of their league squander the time at every turn. Egged on by their buddies they cruise for chicks at Applebees eat pot brownies at a golf course drop the worst pickup lines this side of fraternity row and ogle their neighborhood barista (Nicky Whelan in a role that redefines thankless).The Farrellys dont smuggle in their optimism as deftly as they once did and as Hall Pass turns its attention to the ladies it gets goopy and formulaic. The directors are romantics at heart but the movie feels less certain the more romantic it gets. Still they do a wicked job turning what looks like the ultimate male fantasy into a puncturing of the male ego. Hall Pass is sloppier than the brothers best; you can see where its heading from miles out. Still it manages to upset expectations a Farrelly specialty that never goes out of style.Starring Owen Wilson Jason Sudeikis Jenna Fischer Christina Applegate Nicky Whelan Richard Jenkins Stephen Merchant and J.B.

Comments click to enlarge Hall Pass Video Rated R  105 minutes  2011 Jason Sudeikis and Owen Wilson star as long-married suburbanites who persuade their wives to grant them a therapeutic week off from their vows so they can chase other women. The basic premise has already generated two indie rom-coms--Katie Aseltons The Freebie and Daryl Wein and Zoe Lister-Joness Breaking Upwards--though this being a big-studio release from Peter and Bobby Farrelly (Theres Something About Mary) the idea has been spun out to its fullest comic potential and the ultimate endorsement of monogamy is even more predictable. As in Breaking Upwards the best joke here is that the wives (Jenna Fischer Christina Applegate) wind up getting more action during the marital recess than their hapless hubbies. With Richard Jenkins.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 25 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Feb. 24 2011 318PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English First a short lesson in monarchy. Once upon a brief time the Farrelly brothers enjoyed a reign as the kings of pop comedy earning the crown by taking that regal genre toilet humour and giving it a graphic push into hitherto uncharted parts of the lavatory. No one would accuse them of excessive smarts yet only a prude would deny that culminating in Theres Something About Mary the two had a clever and inventive touch with all things gross. But then along came Judd Apatow who tilling the same general terrain managed to grow pockets of actual wit and buds of warmth and - who would have thought it - characters not completely incredible. Well the kings were dead long live King Judd. Not that the Farrellys abdicated immediately. However since an ill-fated attempt to borrow from their betters - that lame remake of Elaine Mays The Heartbreak Kid - they lapsed into a nearly five-year silence. With Hall Pass the silence is broken. Alas if this is any indication so are the brothers - theyve always lacked the wit to be Apatow now they even lack the confidence to be themselves. Consider the premise A pair of middle-aged guys Rick and Fred (Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis) are given a ""hall pass"" by their disenchanted wives to take a week off from the relative tedium of marriage and re-enter the alleged heaven of bachelorhood. There it is - the whole idea stated in a simple sentence. So why do the Farrellys huff and puff and hem and haw and meander through a full third of the picture before the premise even clicks into low gear? At least the answer isnt long in coming They dont have clue one where to go with it. In short zilch happens. There was definitely something about Mary but theres nothing not a damn thing about Rick amp; Fred amp; Co. Now you might think such a lacuna is a tad problematic in a feature flick but give the Farrellys credit. Having created the vacuum the bros make like nature and pretend to abhor it. They sure can pad. Example The liberated husbands get packed off to a restaurant to gorge on greasy food and thus stuffed to fall asleep. End of scene and how we envy them. Further example The same hubbies-on-hiatus head out to a singles bar to strike out with come-on lines like ""You must be from Ireland because when I look at you my penis is Dublin."" Surprisingly after these and other equally trenchant displays of comedic acumen that vacuum still yawns. Well whats a couple of erstwhile monarchs to do but fall back on their old plumbing and pump the toilet into the humour. Look - out there on the golf course just your average par 4 with a dog-leg to the right and a fat man with his pants down pooping in the sand trap. Look again - in the bathroom at that impressively multitasking woman simultaneously sneezing from one orifice while doing something rather more unpleasant from another. And dont miss the two naked gentlemen in the whirlpool the muscular black fellow and his rotund white buddy offering full-frontal proof that the gods are decidedly undemocratic in their allotment of blessings. Those same fickle gods once blessed the Farrellys with some fame and more fortune. But that was then and this is Hall Pass. No doubt wisdom lies in taking a pass on Hall Pass but bravery demands something else something far more instructive Watch it every vacuous frame if only to measure the precise aesthetic distance from blessing to curse.

A poorly filmed movie that relies heavily on the Farrelly humor that has long been eclipsed by the likes of Judd Apatow. Starring Alyssa Milano Owen Wilson Jenna Fischer Christina Applegate Alexandra Daddario Richard Jenkins Stephen Merchant Vanessa Angel Jason Sudeikis Tyler Hoechlin Director Bobby Farrelly Peter Farrelly Running time 138 Release Opened Feb 25 2011  Editorial Review Cheating hearts and fleeting brainsBy Ann HornadayFriday February 25 2011The Farrelly brothers once the go-to guys for gross-out humor tempered by winning humanism face a quandary In the age of Judd Apatow and movies like ""The Hangover"" how can they keep their brand alive? From the looks of ""Hall Pass"" the answer isnt to up their game. Haphazardly conceived phlegmatically paced lazily filmed and punctuated with gratuitous moments of sexual and scatological slapstick ""Hall Pass"" finds Peter and Bobby Farrelly grasping for shock value at a time when shock possesses virtually no value at all. Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis star as Rick and Fred middle-aged friends who are unexpectedly given permission from their wives to cheat for a week the idea being that theyll get their pre-male-menopausal longing out of their systems and come back more domesticated if not wiser. Its a premise already explored in ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" and ""Hall Pass"" has all the earmarks of an idea cadged from prime-time TV then fluffed into pure nothingness by the magic that is Hollywood (or Atlanta where ""Hall Pass"" was filmed). Wilson and Sudeikis do their best to project their natural warmth in roles that but for a last-minute save in the third act remain infantile and odious. Christina Applegate and ""The Offices"" Jenna Fischer play their long-suffering spouses who wind up following their own pseudo-single bliss on Cape Cod while the boys make lame attempts at hook-ups at their local Applebees. Its as boring and plain-vanilla as the life Rick and Fred pretend to be escaping even when the Farrellys drop an occasional bomb such as a full-frontal close-up that manages to combine graphic excess with a tired racial stereotype; or later when one of the guys dates engages in projectile . . . well it isnt vomiting. Even ickier is the look of ""Hall Pass"" which often seems like it was filmed with a flashlight and a cardboard box leaving most of the frame in grimy shadows. ""Hall Pass"" may not be pretty but does it have to be so ugly?Contains crude and sexual humor throughout profanity some graphic nudity and drug use.

((c)Warner Bros/courtesy Everett Co) Owen Wilson gets single for a week (Courtesy of New Line Production) Owen Wilson Jenna Fischer Jason Sudeikis and Christina Applegate star in ""Hall Pass."" ((c)Warner Bros) Gifted with a one-week vacation from their marriages by their spouses middle-aged suburbanites Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis find that scoring even with permission isnt easy in ""Hall Pass"" an occasionally funny comedy with slow stretches that has directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly returning to their trademark gross-out humor. Thirteen years after their comedy landmark ""Theres Something About Mary"" introduced an unorthodox approach to hair care and four years after their misconceived remake of ""The Heartbreak Kid"" the filmmaking brothers try to stretch. This in its essence is a story about would-be Lotharios with beer bellies who wear sleep-apnea masks and tend to doze off at 915 p.m. after overindulging at Applebees. Best buds and serial oglers Rick (Wilson) and Fred (Sudeikis) have been given ""hall passes"" by their fed-up wives Maggie and Grace (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate). Its a recommendation from their pal (Joy Behar) -- who knows how unlikely it is these rusty Romeos will actually take advantage of their new-found freedom. It takes their trash-talking drinking buddies (Stephen Merchant Larry Joe Campbell JB Smoove) two or three days to figure out just how harmless Rick and Fred are to the opposite sex -- though it will be almost instantly apparent to anyone whos seen ""The Seven Year Itch"" or countless other films about middle-aged male wanderlust. Wilson who was playing youthful womanizers as recently as Decembers awful ""How Do you Know"" does not seem entirely comfortable with a role that requires him to shun the advances of his kids babysitter among other eager females. But ""Saturday Night Live"" star Sudeikis in his first lead role is perfect as the restless but utterly clueless Fred an insurance agent described by his wife as being like ""a demented cat scratching at the door."" When their hapless attempts to pick up women -- with hopeless pickup lines -- fail they receive tutoring from the biggest swinger in Providence R.I. He is played with an orange tan and a leather vest by Oscar nominee Richard Jenkins looking alarmingly like Freddie Kreuger. Theres a humiliating visit to a massage parlor; an eruption of bodily fluids from a prospective paramour; the babysitters man-hungry aunt; and gay-panic jokes. In other words just about what youd expect from a 1998 movie. The Farrellys almost go off the rails with a comic shootout/chase involving a hot barista (Nicky Whalen) that Rick has a crush on -- and her insanely jealous co-worker (Derek Waters). But then they show us that Rick and Freds wives who have taken the kids to Cape Cod for the week are tempted to take their own vacations from marriage -- Maggie with a smooth-talking pal of her dads and Grace with a college baseball player. She doesnt have a large role but Applegate is the best thing in ""Hall Pass"" -- though veteran cinematographer Matthew Leonetti should be ashamed at how unflatteringly he has photographed her. If you go be sure to stick around through the closing credits. By far the funniest part of the movie is a blackly humorous fantasy sequence starring Merchant. loulumenick.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Academy Awards to stay on ABC through 2020 at least Read Next Academy Awards to stay on ABC through 2020 at least Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 14240 How Hillary blew her big moment 8041 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 5835 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(Iovino/Warner Bros) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday February 25 2011 400 AM Title Hall Pass With Owen Wilson Jason Sudeikis. Comedy about bored middle-aged husbands. Directors Bobby Farrelly Peter Farrelly (145). R Nudity sexuality language crude humor. At area theaters.Ever catch yourself thinking ""Man I wish beer commercials lasted just 104 minutes longer""?The Farrelly brothers are ready to make your dreams come true.At this point were so well-conditioned by ads and Judd Apatow movies that it almost seems reasonable to believe two clueless boy-men like Fred (Jason Sudeikis) and Rick (Owen Wilson the cast standout) would be married to pretty endlessly patient Grace (Christina Applegate) and Maggie (Jenna Fischer). And that they freely ogle every other woman in sight while out with their wives.So naturally theres no reason to doubt anyones sanity when the ladies become so scared of losing their spouses they suggest a ""hall pass"" -- one week off in which the guys can do whatever they want.And what do these self-deluded wanna-be studs do?Exactly what youd expect golf eat ""naughty"" brownies and make perpetual fools of themselves with the complete encouragement of their equally moronic buddies (including Stephen Merchant and J.B. Smoove both underused).As the recent rush of guys-gone-wild comedies proves theres always room for another wish-fulfillment fantasy. But most of the time the Farrellys play things as safe as possible -- an ironic choice for a movie that pretends to be about taking risks.The best laughs are the sharpest as when the brothers take wicked swipes at suburban conformity and middle-aged frustrations.But these are just brief distractions from the generic lessons to be learned about the importance of loyalty and love and making sure you dont alienate any members of the ticket-buying public.What a strange turn of events for filmmakers once celebrated for pushing the limits of popular culture. But as you watch their latest with its desperate gross-out jokes replacing actual edge youll remember that ""Theres Something About Mary"" was 13 long years ago.Whats most depressing isnt the laziness of the Mars/Venus setup in which men and women dont just occupy different planets but unrelated galaxies. And its not the frantic scattershot script which seems designed to appease a thousand focus groups. Whats depressing is the realization that Bobby and Peter Farrelly are no different from their confused heroes stuck in a midlife rut they dont know how to escape.

(Warner Bros.) Hall Pass Owen Wilson Jenna Fischer wasted in tasteless Hall Pass BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Feb 25 2011 (...) Peter Iovino Alexandra Daddario and Owen Wilson in ""Hall Pass."" (Warner Bros.) When Peter and Bobby Farrelly who popularized a brand of crass comedy with ""Dumb and Dumber"" saw the grosses for movies like ""The Hangover"" they must have puked. Then they must have thought that people puking was still a profitable basis for making a movie.Brother were they wrong.Like the middle-aged dads in this flaccid fiasco ""Hall Pass"" is a decade behind the curve of whats happening. The Farrellys added heart to their formula more than a decade ago in ""Theres Something About Mary"" but theres something rancid in the fake sincerity that is supposed to leaven this tasteless tale about men on a bender. Rhode Island real estate agent Rick (Owen Wilson) has a loving wife Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and two kids. But hes also got a needy inner child who comes out to play when hes with insurance-agent buddy Fred (Jason Sudeikis whose recurrent casting as a comedy sidekick is a mystery).When Maggie and Freds wife Grace (Christina Applegate) overhear the fellows making moronic boob jokes they grant their husbands a one-week ""hall pass"" of infidelity and inebriation because well a psychologist played by Joy Behar said it would be a good idea.So the guys check into a nearby hotel and convene a meeting of their round table which also includes a black guy (J.B. Smoove) who seems to be in the movie for the sole purpose of steering them to a meat market; a British guy (Stephen Merchant) who seems to be in the movie for the sole purpose of getting them stoned on pot brownies; and a fat guy (Larry Joe Campbell) who seems to be in the movie for the sole purpose of defecating on a golf course. The closest thing to a joke here is that these wild-and-crazy guys really dont know how to swing. Much of the movie is about the tedium of waiting for something to happen like a hook-up with the impossibly hot Australian chick from the coffee shop (Nicky Whelan).Meanwhile Fischer and Applegate two of the funniest sexiest women in comedy are reduced to playing frumps flirting with minor-league baseball players until their menfolk wise up. If you cant guess what happens in the end you dont understand demographic marketing.The once vital and funny Wilson has been in some bad movies lately but ""Hall Pass"" makes ""Drillbit Taylor"" seem like ""Doctor Zhivago.""One and half stars (out of four)  Rating R  Run time 145  Content Crude humor strong language some nudity and drug use Videos Hall Pass trailer Feb 24 2011 (...)

Hall Pass Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2011) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hall-pass-2011,200,hallpass18,hallpass,rogerebert
"Hall Pass | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hall-pass ) Hall Pass (United States 2011) February 24 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli In 1998 Bobby and Peter Farrelly pushed the raunchy comedy envelope with their breakout hit Theres Something about Mary. Since then two things have changed the Farrelly Brothers have become softer (Exhibit A their PG-13 2005 romantic comedy Fever Pitch) and the hard-R comedy genre has made Theres Something about Mary look like a Disney movie. Hall Pass represents the Farrelly Brothers stab at regaining the crown they lost more than a decade ago and to do so they have pulled few tricks from Judd Apatows playbook. That means making sure theres an element of sweetness to be found underneath the fecal matter bodily fluids pot brownies and naked dicks. Some of the material in Hall Pass is just plain gross but some of it is damn funny. The shock value is much higher than in Theres Something about Mary but perhaps surprisingly theres an element of relationship insight in the screenplay. No one is going to mistake Hall Pass for an existential introspective French drama but theres a little more to this movie about love marriage and monogamy than one might glean from the trailers. Rick (Owen Wilson) and Maggie (Jenna Fischer) have been together for 20 years and have three young children. Fred (Jason Sudeikis) and Grace (Christina Applegate) have been together for nearly as long but are childless. Both marriages are in trouble however with the rot of routine having set in. Maggie fakes sleep to avoid having sex. Rick fantasizes about the 20-year old babysitter and ogles the sexy Aussie barista (Nicky Whelan) at the local coffee bar. When Maggie and Grace bemoan their situation to a psychologist friend they receive some unusual advice give the men ""hall passes"" - a week during which they can forget their marriage vows and do whatever they want. The inevitable disillusionment that will come from fortysomething suburbanites acting like frat boys will give them a new appreciation for what they have at home. So Maggie packs up the kids and she and Grace head for a cottage at the Cape while Rick and Fred learn that freedom can lead to desperation (and that Applebys isnt a great pick-up place). Hall Pass isnt by any means flawless but its ability to integrate extreme scatological humor with moments of genuine feeling is rare. Owen Wilson is solid as an average guy who fantasizes about what it might be like to be single then when faced with an opportunity recognizes how much he loves and misses his wife. For him Hall Pass is a love story and a sweet one at that. Jason Sudeikis tones down the over-the-top comedy we often see from SNL alumni plying their trade on the big screen. The Farrellys try to give him screen time to match Wilsons but he ends up seeming like a sidekick. His character arc is less affecting although he gets some of the biggest (and in at least in one case the most disgusting) laughs. Hall Pass missteps by providing occasional glimpses into whats happening with the wives. The movie needs either more of them for balance or none at all (at least when theyre on vacation) - presenting their stories by halves leaves the viewer with a sense that something is missing. Although not all of the humor is of the raunchy and/or gross-out variety (good use is made of the Law amp; Order tones) its hard to see Hall Pass appealing to someone who doesnt appreciate this sort of comedy on some level. To be fair the funniest material is often not the most extreme. As has become the norm in recent films male nudity is used to comedic effect and since Hall Pass aims to earn its R-rating its not just a moon shot or two. The female nudity on the other hand (and there isnt much) can be seen as either titillating or rewarding patience depending on your point-of-view. The standout performance to the extent that there can be said to be one in a production of this sort belongs to Richard Jenkins the character actor who got everyones notice with The Visitor a rare leading role on an eclectic resume. Here he doesnt make his appearance until the films final third but when he arrives he dominates every scene hes in. His portrayal provides him with an opportunity to show that hes as good with comedy as he is with drama. Many extreme comedies focus so much on the outrageous antics of the characters that theres little left beyond the shock value. Hall Pass offers more and thats what sets it apart from disappointing material like Hot Tub Time Machine. When the film is over the viewer will feel like he has been told a story rather than merely subjected to a string of rude hit-or-miss jokes. Hall Pass likely wont be the sensation that Theres Something about Mary was 13 years ago or even that The Hangover was two years ago but its better than one expects from it and thats as unique a quality as its other characteristic a comedy thats sporadically funny.

Peter Iovino) Photo Peter Iovino AP Hall Pass review Hubbies gone wild 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Hall Pass Comedy. Starring Owen Wilson Jason Sudeikis Christina Applegate and Jenna Fischer. Directed by Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly. (R. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) That the Farrelly brothers are intent on making a different kind of comedy in ""Hall Pass"" - a departure from the gross-out farces that theyre known for (""Theres Something About Mary"" ""The Heartbreak Kid"") - is apparent from the second laugh line. Here when characters say something funny they know theyre being funny. The joke is not on them. ""Hall Pass"" attempts to take the Farrellys harsh humor and bring it into harmony with what has become the modern comic style which is to be coarse but not absurd to be brutally honest but real. To an extent maybe even to a large extent the Farrellys succeed. ""Hall Pass"" is watchable and engaging. There are three or four comic set pieces of a kind that these guys do really well that are laugh-out-loud funny. This will be enough for most people; in a way it should be enough. Yet theres something just off about the movie something discordant or out of balance and the biggest evidence of this is that the funniest stuff doesnt grow naturally from the story or characters but feels appended thrown on as afterthought like a condiment to add a little flavor. ""Hall Pass"" is a comedy about two married guys in early middle age who keep ogling and fantasizing about other women to a degree that has become obvious and ever-so-slightly disgusting to their wives. So the wives give the guys a ""hall pass"" - that is the women leave town for one week and give the men permission to cheat on them in their absence no questions asked. The idea is that removing the taboo might remove the temptation. If the Farrellys wanted this to be their stab at a comedy of honest observation they really boxed themselves in with this subject. Its just really difficult to make an honest movie about individual marriages because audiences invariably see movies with married characters not as discrete stories but as pronouncements about marriage in general. Thus not only is it preordained that every movie must end up reinforcing monogamous matrimony as an ideal but even worse every comedy must make sure that no one transgresses so much against the marriage bed as to make him or her unworthy of returning to it. These limits are the source of all thats off about ""Hall Pass."" But isnt it odd? Here are the Farrellys making their supposedly honest truthful comedy and yet not once did it occur to anybody to be honest or truthful. At the very least it doesnt seem to have dawned on anybody to advance past the acceptable romantic comedy cliches of bumbling sexually inept husbands and long-suffering levelheaded wives. Incredibly it doesnt even seem to have occasioned a fresh look at the situation as presented in the film itself in which the guys - Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis - look pretty under-loved to the point of neglect by their wives (Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate). So in ""Hall Pass"" male sexuality remains fundamentally adolescent and men remain boys sharing marriage with women who become their mother substitutes. (You could say that over the course of 60 years of comedy men have become Lucy and women have become Ricky.) Indeed lets hope this isnt the Farrellys statement about the institution of marriage because if marriage were really this pathetic why should anyone bother? Still within these constraints and within the limits of its ambition ""Hall Pass"" is perfectly acceptable. Sudeikis plays a routine zany but Wilson gets to let out his latent sweetness; Fischer is thoroughly appealing though telling her apart from Amy Adams and Isla Fischer (not related) isnt going to be easy. And Applegate is a first-rate comedian too often found in third-rate movies so second-rate is an improvement. The film also features Nicky Whelan who is drop-dead howl-at-the-moon gorgeous but apparently not gorgeous enough to make a virtuous love-starved husband overcome his boyish apprehensions and discover within himself a libido stronger than a corpses. Such scenes are not only too far-fetched for comedy. Theyre beyond science fiction. -- Advisory Full-frontal male nudity topless women strong language constant crude humor.

"Movie review Hall Pass - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FredMovie review Hall PassWith this comedy about husbands given permission to have affairs directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly show its time to grow up.February 25 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Kristen Carey left Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis star in ""Hall... (Peter Iovino New Line Cinema )Maybe its finally time for Peter and Bobby Farrelly the filmmaking sibs who brought us the very salty treat of ""Theres Something About Mary"" to give up on the raunch and give into the romance. After scoring big in 1998 with ""Mary"" a the zipper issue the ""hair gel"" mix-up the roving troubadours a their raw inventive edge has never been quite as sharp. ""Hall Pass"" starring Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis continues that creative slide into everyday crude (because watching a guy poop in a sand trap is neither clever nor funny). Caught in a tug-of-war between the filmmakers cleaned up conventional romance A  la 2005s ""Fever Pitch"" and the grosser stuff found in 2000s split personality spoof ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" the film is a messed-up mix of both. Wilsons Rick is a mostly happy guy married with children. His biggest infraction these days is getting caught doing the occasional girl watching. Fred (Sudeikis) is his best friend also married also with the roving eye problem. Their wives a Jenna Fischers Maggie is paired with Rick Christina Applegates Grace with Fred a are fed up. But after a consulting their friend relationship guru Dr. Lucy (""The Views"" Joy Behar) instead of getting mad the girls give the guys a ""hall pass"" from marriage a seven days to do what they please with whomever they please with no guilt or punishment in the offing. To cheat or not to cheat that is the question. But is it cheating if the wife approves in advance? Maybe thats the question. Regardless after the pass is issued the dilemma becomes trying to figure out where to find someone to seduce. The shape of things to come is laid out when Rick and Freds contingent of envious buddies wonder whether Olive Garden or Applebees has more chicks on the prowl. While the guys try to remember how to be players the girls head to the Cape and find a little action of their own. Temptations do come along and that is where the comedy should come alive. Mildly amusing or marginally offensive is about as good as it gets. For Rick theres the baby sitter (Alexandra Daddario) he wants to avoid and the barista (Nicky Whelan) he might like to bed. For Fred there are the leftovers. Then along comes trouble in the form of Richard Jenkins playboy their guide to the club scene where everything really gets ""crazy"" (A Those are sarcastic air quotes and B I really hope this very fine actor got paid bookoo bucks to suffer the indignities and the tan required here). Given the guys tendency to get sidetracked by all-you-can-eat specials it doesnt take much for them to veer off course. The wives are doing much better at the Cape. Theres a minor league baseball team in town with some major talent. Flirtations ensue soul-searching follows. Can epiphanies be far behind? The screenplay by Pete Jones Kevin Barnett and the brothers throws a lot of balls up in the air. The directors do better juggling some than others. Though Wilson and Sudeikis are the center of attention the film is often more engaging when Fischer and Applegates characters begin digging through their problems. Meanwhile Sudeikis an ""SNL"" fixture apparently drew the short straw. Hes saddled with most of the dirty business of talking trashy. Director of photography Matthew F. Leonetti who last worked with the Farrellys on 2007s ""The Heartbreak Kid"" has given the film a warm and cozy look. It starts with the very charming scene that has Rick reading to his kids on a very comfy couch. Comfy is exactly the vibe that Wilson gives off pretty much all the time. He has a self-deprecating appeal that tends to make even his quirkiest characters in the most forgettable films embraceable. For all the off-colors they wave the Farrellys have a winning sentimental side too. Its time for them to get past their Peter Pan potty-mouth days. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Were the Millers cant fake the laughsAugust 6 2013Could Behind the Candelabra have been successful as a...May 28 2013Movie review Crazy Stupid LoveJuly 29 2011With Hall Pass the Farrelly brothers grow up (sort of)February 24 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTFredJoy BeharJason SudeikisBaby-sitterCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-hall-pass-20110225,0,4532424.story",200,hallpass21,hallpass,latimes

By Peter Iovino New Line Cinema Learning from the master Perpetual bachelor Coakley (Richard Jenkins) center tries to show Fred (Jason Sudeikis) left and Rick (Owen Wilson) a good time when they get a week off from their marital responsibilities. EnlargeClose By Peter Iovino New Line Cinema Learning from the master Perpetual bachelor Coakley (Richard Jenkins) center tries to show Fred (Jason Sudeikis) left and Rick (Owen Wilson) a good time when they get a week off from their marital responsibilities. The thinking is that by giving a horny spouse a week off from his marriage and allowing unchecked roaming he will return with a new appreciation of family life. Perhaps if this had been a saucy French sex comedy it might have taken off. But in the hands of directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly its a clunky non-starter. Its almost impressive when a movie can manage to be both repellently vulgar and sickeningly sweet in the span of a mere two hours. Almost. FARRELLY BROTHERS ON HALL PASS Its ultimately pro-marriage The Farrellys output over the years has been uneven. On the plus side they made 1998s Theres Something About Mary and 2003s Stuck on You. But the now-50ish brothers appear to be regressing. Since the days of Mary Judd Apatow has filled the gap perfecting the raunchy heartfelt comedy with his deft interlacing of raucous and charming. But Hall Pass efforts to make us wince and smile mostly just induce a recoil effect. Or a gag reflex. Do they really think projectile diarrhea is funny for anyone over 11? And if this movie is meant for teens and twentysomethings what would they find interesting in a story about the travails of suburban married couples? Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis play middle-aged husbands with a mild case of arrested development. They cant stop checking out every woman they see -- and commenting on her attributes. Hall Pass  1/2 out of four Stars Owen Wilson Jason Sudeikis Jenna Fischer Christina Applegate Director Peter and Bobby Farrelly Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for crude and sexual humor language some graphic nudity and drug use Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Jenna Fischer plays Wilsons wife and Christina Applegate is married to Sudeikis. The gals give their guys the marital version of a sailors leave. They allow them a week free of marital responsibilities without fear of reprisal. Yes that means all the infidelity you can handle in seven days. But the tables turn and the guys spend their time mostly golfing smoking weed and digging into Ben and Jerrys rather than indulging in a string of affairs. The women are the ones who meet handsome hunks and tangle with temptation. If only that scenario were as banal as it sounds. The Farrellys compulsion for gross-out humor results in a steady procession of toilet jokes masturbation references and a recurring gag about oral sex that doesnt get any funnier the more often its told. Wilson appears particularly defanged. He plays his role more like the sweater-vest-clad father in Leave It to Beaver than a contemporary husband/dad. Hes better in loopy roles such as uber-model Hansel in Zoolander or any movie directed by Wes Anderson with whom he first came to attention in the very funny Bottle Rocket (1996). Hilariously teamed with Vince Vaughn in 2005s Wedding Crashers he seems to need the right comic partner for his talents to surface. Sudeikis is not that guy. Fischer (The Office) looks as if shed rather be anywhere but in this movie. Applegate was much funnier on TVs Samantha Who?. One of the strangest things about this miscast mess is how its mired in a 1950s view of marriage. You almost expect one of the guys to refer to his wife as ""the old ball and chain."" How can its humor seem sharp when so much of the foundation feels as dated and as desperate as a party of swingin singles? For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

By Dana Stevens Hall Pass I apologize to my mother for the review Im about to write but the Farrelly brothers have driven me to it. Their latest movie Hall Pass (New Line Cinema) traffics in a brand of misogyny so puzzling that it can only be analyzed by examining the films raunchy jokes at close range. The Farrellys have always prided themselves on their frank approach to body humor and sometimes (with Kingpin Theres Something About Mary and Dumb and Dumber) theyve deployed it to ickily funny effect. But Hall Pass marks a shift in tone for the brothers. (One that was perhaps already present in their last film a notoriously unfunny remake of The Heartbreak Kid --as a fan of the 1972 original I couldnt bring myself to see that one.) Their taboo-stomping energy has given way to flaccid anomie. Hall Pass is about two guys trying to recapture their youthful mojo but it also appears to be made by men who fit that description. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) are old college friends turned married working stiffs a Realtor and an insurance salesman respectively based in the Farrellys native Rhode Island. (If the version of Providence they live in looks suspiciously sundrenched its because the film was actually shot in Atlanta.) They love their wives (and in Ricks case his three conveniently invisible children) but theyre chafing at the bit of their routine suburban lives too much responsibility and domesticity not enough poker and sex. At a housewarming party for an awful social-climbing neighbor the buddies are captured on security-cam video making vulgar fun of the host and his wife. Advertisement Horrified at their husbands knuckle-dragging humor and incessant ogling of babes Ricks wife Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and Freds wife Grace (Christina Applegate) consult with their pop-psychologist friend (The Views Joy Behar) who urges them to consider a ""hall pass""--a week off from marriage during which the guys will be free to do whatever they want with no questions asked. With surprising (and implausible) alacrity the women agree and repair to Maggies parents Cape Cod beach house for a vacation with the kids. (As in most contemporary comedies a high level of material comfort is something the characters in Hall Pass seem to take for granted.) For the next seven days--counted down with a Law amp; Order-style ""cha-chung"" sound effect--Rick and Fred do their best to recapture their horn-dog single-guy days while their wives pursue their own flirtations with members of a minor-league baseball team. This movies midsection is as soft as a suburban dads. The multiple scenes in which the boys cavort with their poker buddies at various venues unlikely to contain willing young women (a golf course an Applebees) all make the same point Though they talk big Rick and Fred are in fact afraid to test their chick-picking-up skills and petrified to cheat on their wives. The idea of casting the easygoing Wilson as a dorky suburbanite had promise but neither he nor Sudeikis (a Saturday Night Live regular with a limited range of expression) get a chance to do much except masturbate girl-watch and mope. Both the best and worst jokes in this middle stretch come not from the leads but from their buddy posse Stephen Merchant as an uptight British nerd Larry Joe Campbell as the obligatory big fat slob JB Smoove as the even more obligatory one black friend. Eventually the guys eternally single ego ideal Coakley (Farrelly fave Richard Jenkins cast amusingly against type) arrives in town to tutor them in the art of singles-bar gamesmanship. Ricks resolve is tested by a comely Australian barista (Nicky Whelan) and Freds by a variety of potential conquests including a girl at a bar with an unspecified abdominal ailment (one guess where that gag is going) and the 45-year-old aunt (ha ha 45) of Ricks babysitter. But whether through cowardice or incompetence the boys cant seem to take their plans to the next level while up at the Cape their wives are struggling to fend off the minor-league-ball-playing hunks. I think thats enough setup to get into the question that most interests me about this movie How does it want us to feel about women? Unlike male-bonding comedies such as Pineapple Express or I Love You Man Hall Pass isnt really about the joys and exigencies of male friendship. Rick and Fred are longtime buddies whose connection remains basically static throughout the movie. Rather this is a film singlemindedly obsessed with mens pursuit of women not only their sexual favors but their gaze and approval and love. And yet the script--by the Farrellys with co-writers Pete Jones and Kevin Barnett--reflects a deep ambivalence about female people Are they frightening? Boring? Sickening? Do they represent freedom or constraint safety or danger? In the end--I dont think its spoiling anything to say this--Hall Pass reaffirms the primacy of the male-female marriage bond. But boy is it an uneasy alliance. A major ongoing gag in the movie--in fact it provides the closing line--has to do with a sexual practice Fred calls ""fake chow"" in which (forgive me Mom) a man pretends to go down on a woman while actually just using his fingers and making loud smacking sounds with his mouth. Practicability aside (would anyone not on roofies fall for this?) the fake-chow joke raises the genuinely confounding question Why? If Fred and Ricks entire goal in life is the pursuit of pussy why dont they enjoy it when they get it? If vaginas are that offputting shouldnt the heroes experience their relatively sexless marriages as a relief? The possible roles a movie like Hall Pass offers to women are almost psychotically narrow and self-contradictory Either were dull domestic harridans or enticing yet fatally hideous Medusas. If the Farrellys want to make movies that explore the American man-boys simultaneous love and fear of women--a theme that if treated well could be fascinating--I hope theyll eventually put their mouths where their money is.

"Give Hall Pass a pass | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGive Hall Pass a passThe once-funny Farrelly Brothers trade gross gags for a plot in Hall Pass.Jason Sudeikis as Fred left and Owen Wilson as Rick in Hall Pass.  (PETER IOVINO PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Feb. 24 2011 Hall Pass (out of 4) Starring Owen Wilson Jason Sudeikis Jenna Fischer Christina Applegate and Richard Jenkins. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly. At major theatres. 105 minutes. 14A The explosive poop joke has become the Hail Mary pass among the desperate in comedy movies. Its a last-ditch grab for laughs when the picture is circling the drain and the once-funny Farrelly Brothers shouldnt have to sink this low. These are after all the guys who created some of the most hilarious scenes on celluloid in Theres Something About Mary. Nobody could use hair gel for a year without sniggering. The brothers have been losing mojo over the years perhaps distracted by the swath Judd Apatow was cutting through the movieplex with his new-millennium brand of gross-out humour. As the Farrellys struggled to up the ante (or lower the bar) subsequent flicks from the bros. were hit and miss. Stuck on You worked although it didnt reach the heights of Mary; and The Heartbreak Kid with its donkey sex scene just laid there like a beached whale. Now Hall Pass arrives borne on a ridiculous idea and peppered with gross gags randomly wedged in to prop up a boring repetitive story. Forty-something suburbanites Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (SNLs Jason Sudeikis clearly not yet ready for prime time as a lead) love their wives and see nothing wrong with their fondness for checking out hot women. Wives Maggie (The Offices Jenna Fischer) and Grace (Anchormans Christina Applegate) beg to differ. After some overheard raunchy guy talk about nailing supermodels and encouraged by a pop psychologist pal (Joy Behar who should have no illusions about quitting her day job) the wives make the astonishing leap of logic that if they let their Bambis run free in the female forest theyll return to be better husbands. Its understandable that Rick and Fred are thinking about doing the horizontal mambo with every gal they see. Aside from the ""its biology"" excuse theres zero chemistry between the spouses in both couples. Wilsons Rick doesnt even seem comfortable talking to his kids let alone cuddling with Maggie. The first scenes of the newly off-leash husbands hint at what Hall Pass could have been. Horndog Fred and nerdy Rick head out trolling for babes at the local Applebees convinced the lax chick action in the family resto will pick up soon. Or maybe Olive Garden would be better? The running gag that these two losers couldnt pick up a lettuce leaf in a salad bar is wearing thin by the time Rick starts to get some traction with a pretty Aussie barista (Nicky Whelan) much to the annoyance of her co-worker Brent whose anger issues surface later. But a mishap in a gym whirlpool deflates Ricks seduction plan while giving us some astonishingly long looks at full-frontal male nudity complete with a racial stereotype. It would have been fun to see more of their craggy pal Coakley (well played by Richard Jenkins) who dispenses sage pickup advice based on the fact hes been hanging out in singles bars and at Club Meds for 20 years (to tell the truth looks more like 30 mate). While the guys are striking out Maggie looks close to rounding the bases with a hunky silver fox softball coach and Grace has caught the eye of the young stallion who rules first base. That part of the story plays like an afterthought although it does give the girls equal time to consider the merits of their own hall passes. The Farrellys once masters of the funny script now seem to have no time for outrageous plots or the killer dialogue we loved them for. Theyre too busy lobbing pot brownies horny cougars and poop jokes at the wall in a slapped-together story hung on a string of frat-boy yucks that makes us yearn for the much-missed exquisitely elevated art of Dumb amp; Dumber.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Bobby and Peter Farrelly have brought water to the arid desert currently calling itself American film comedy. Its a drink spiked with enough crudeness to cause a nasty bout of dysentery. But things are currently in such perilous shape that excremental splatter qualifies as a major sign of life -- both for American comedy and the Farrellys whose previous movie a cynical remake of ""The Heartbreak Kid suggested they were all but dead.""Hall Pass is the brothers 10th movie and their most gangbusters since ""Me Myself amp; Irene which turns 11 this year. The new films hook makes a gimmicky first impression. The wives of two suburban salesmen give their men a week to cheat. This sounds like something ripped from The New York Times Sunday Styles section and processed into the sort of movie that brought us say ""I Love You Man in which two straight strangers fall platonically in love.If the Farrellys are chasing social fads their movie serves as hilarious forensic evidence of the precipitous downside of some would-be trends. And by ""forensic I mean theyve gotten the ""Law amp; Order ""chung chung in on the nonsense. The sound effect marks the seven tragic days and nights during which Rick (Owen Wilson) and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) pursue seduction.Rick had been happy unconsciously ogling other women. Fred has learned to love masturbating in his minivan. Its their wives Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and Grace (Christina Applegate) who need a change. They take the advice of a friend and successful shrink (Joy Behar) who says letting her husband pursue other women for a spell only strengthened her marriage. The joke in ""Hall Pass is that very married men might be too socially out of shape for extramarital sex especially when permitted to have it. Single people also know that when you go looking for sex it rarely happens. That might be why Maggie and Grace fare better vacationing in Wellfleet. (The movie was shot in Georgia but its completely apparent only when the Atlanta-area treasure the Stella Bass Band shows up for comic wallpaper in a club scene.)Rick and Fred suffer from early onset middle-age. Theyre about 40 and dont appear to see anything wrong with looking for women at a Providence Applebees. Their first free night is spent with three married buddies -- Stephen Merchant Larry Joe Campbell and J.B. Smoove -- who watch Rick and Fred live their dream while stuck proverbially in class. Night one ends with the five of them sluggishly looking at rib bones and bottles of red wine theyve drunk. Their lips are burgundy.""Hall Pass is unlike ""The Hangover a similar if far nastier and less competently made comedy that buried its best raunchiest material in a montage coda. That movie was devoid of any real life. ""Hall Pass bursts with it. Details like those burgundy lips are what I love about the Farrellys who wrote the film with Kevin Barnett and Pete Jones. When theyre at their best theyve located tremendous comedy in throwaway bits whose sharpness has a paper-cut sting. The scenes proceed in a breakneck manner in which a sequence is assembled so that each cut is funnier than what preceded it. That sort of escalation is used twice here. On ""Day 3 Fred whos easily the crasser and more desperate of the two gets drunk at a bar and vulgarly berates a table full of uninterested but not unamused women. Hes punched out.Chung chung ""Day 4. The camera then hovers over Rick and Fred splayed on two hotel beds with Fred hooked up to a breathing contraption whose awful elaborateness Grace so undersells in an earlier description that its exponentially funnier when we actually see it.Its a relief to have the Farrellys working so close to the height of their powers when too many comedies are operating at rock bottom. Theyve honed the skills of gross sincerity and sincere grossness. But the most surprising strain -- in ""Theres Something About Mary ""Fever Pitch and even ""Shallow Hal -- is how theyre also about what women want and what theyll tolerate in a man.Indeed for the havoc wreaked by pot brownies hot tubs exploding flatulence and stunt penises (OK two) ""Hall Pass also remains a reassuringly human movie in which even Sudeikis a ""Saturday Night Live regular manages to play his first complete movie character a horndog who adores his wife. Fred and Rick discover that a loving heart doesnt cure a wandering eye. It just puts a patch over it.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

Most gaspworthy is that this raunchy transgressive comedy about would-be adulterers turns out to be a hot wet reaffirmation of marriage.Set in Farrellyville by which I mean Providence R.I. (but shot in Atlanta) the sporadically funny film stars Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis as Rick and Fred (hat tip to I Love Lucy). With their short-cropped hair and dweeby vibe the Realtor and the insurance broker are introduced as tame-and-sane husbands longing for wild-and-crazy days that never were.How do they spell monotony? M-o-n-o-g-a-m-y. They think of themselves as players even as they resemble Alfred E. Neuman and Howdy Doody in Dockers.Their exasperated wives Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and Grace (Christina Applegate) have had it up to here with their adolescent ogling. The wives power-walk with a psychologist (Joy Behar) who prescribes a radical remedy Give em a vacation from marriage and they wont know what to do with their freedom.The wives decamp to Cape Cod giving Rick and Fred a ""hall pass"" a week off from marriage no questions asked. It never occurs to the husbands that it is a vacation for the wives as well.The films running joke Why if all the world is a sexual buffet are Rick and Fred grazing at Applebees?Yes Hall Pass has the obligatory bathroom humor we have come to expect from the Farrellys. Two occasions are laugh-out-loud; the others mostly out-loud without laughs.But it also has an undertow of melancholy that makes it less funny ha-ha than funny-sad. The assumption of the film is that marriage emasculates men and empowers women ""Why do women get a house and babies and we get nothing?"" demands a fired-up Fred. Whats wrong with this picture? The men are arrested-development cases and the women their wardens.As for the performances Wilson does well by his wistful manboy as does reliable Applegate with her turn as the cougar-in-kittens clothes. There is a third-act appearance by a well-known character actor almost unrecognizable here as the Hugh Hefner of Providence. He is stone hilarious. Otherwise I liked this movie better when it was called The Seven-Year Itch.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet When Bobby and Peter Farrelly first started releasing movies in the mid-90s it would have seemed silly to ponder what a mature Farrelly brothers film might look like. The team behind Dumb And Dumber didnt seem to have maturity in them. And yet in 2011 heres the answer to the question nobody asked in the first place Hall Pass is a Farrelly comedy filled with marital anxiety and explosive diarrhea. And though the film never balances the grown-up stuff with the gross-out gags it suggests the Farrellys might be able to do mature after all. Of course they started that a while ago. The Farrellys best films--particularly Theres Something About Mary and the perennially underappreciated Kingpin--always seemed invested in steering their characters toward growth and happiness and though Hall Pass doesnt rank with their best it shares that trait. A genuinely soulful performance from Owen Wilson helps. Here he plays a dweeby suburban dad with a good heart but a wandering eye. Tired of and turned off by his behavior--particularly after overhearing a pair of gross conversations with pal Jason Sudeikis--Wilsons wife (Jenna Fischer) gives him a no-questions-asked week off from marriage in the form of the eponymous ""hall pass."" Equally fed up Sudeikis wife (Christina Applegate) follows suit leaving the men a week to return to single life with a gaggle of married pals (led by Stephen Merchant) watching from the sidelines. Thats a hacky premise but the Farrellys give it a frequently funny and just as frequently heartfelt execution. The early scenes portray how boredom frustration and misunderstanding can creep into even the most stable marriage via the intimacy-killing grind of child-rearing routines. But cast adrift Wilson and Sudeikis dont know what to do with themselves and the best gags involve the terror just beneath the surface of their new freedom. Hall Pass isnt consistently funny It takes a while to get going and throws in a few more subplots than it really needs. But a few jokes hit hard the rest prove mildly amusing and the care taken with the characters goes a long way. That care extends across the entire cast too. Hall Pass lets its female characters voice their frustration as well. And while the men still get the lions share of the screen time Hall Pass still looks like a Catherine Breillat film compared to the forced bimbo-ization performed on Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman in Just Go With It. Still a postscript with Merchant that delivers big laughs after a stream of chuckles suggests the Farrellys have been reining it in a bit too much and theyd be best served by not getting too mature. Maybe theyll get the balance right next time. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Heartbeats Next Movie Review Drive Angry Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Associated Press Christy LemireAP Movie Critic Published Thursday February 24 2011 at 929 a.m. Last Modified Thursday February 24 2011 at 929 a.m. The Farrelly brothers continue to strain desperately for their gross-out glory days with ""Hall Pass"" their latest ""comedy"" -- and yes that word is in quotes for a reason. Facts Film facts ""Hall Pass"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release is rated R for crude and sexual humor throughout language some graphic nudity and drug use.Running time 105 minutes. The film opens Feb. 25 at AMC Houma Palace 10 5737 W. Park Ave. For showings and ticket prices call 1-888-AMC-4FUN or visit www.movietickets.com or www.fandango.com.Rating One and a half stars out of four. Think about it. What was the last truly deeply funny movie they made ... ""Theres Something About Mary""? And that was back in 1998. With ""Stuck on You"" (2003) they came close to achieving that desired mix of humor and heart and they had a great cast in Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear. But their version of ""Fever Pitch"" (2005) never worked up any real heat -- and that criticism comes from a Boston Red Sox fan.So here are brothers Peter and Bobby Farrelly once again collaborating as writers and directors trying to mine suburbia for its latent horniness and untapped bodily fluids with singularly uninspired results. (Pete Jones and Kevin Barnett share screenwriting credit.)Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis co-star as longtime friends Rick and Fred who are trapped in stereotypically stagnant marriages. Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate play their wives Maggie and Grace who are such cliched spiteful nags they pretend to be asleep in order to withhold sex from their husbands as a means of gaining control.Are you laughing yet? Its a frustrating waste of Fischer and Applegate two hugely likable actresses who happen to have a knack for raunchy comedy -- when its well-written that is. Then again ""Hall Pass"" doesnt make particularly good use of its male stars talents either; the off-kilter charisma that marks Wilsons best work has been obliterated. So at least its equal opportunity.Anyway Maggie and Grace get some advice one day from their psychologist friend (a weirdly miscast Joy Behar) to give their husbands a ""hall pass"" a week off from marriage to allow them to pursue all the hotties theyve been surreptitiously ogling (or so they think -- theyre not too stealthy). Rick in particular has had his eye on the gorgeous Australian barista at his local coffeehouse (Nicky Whelan) who seems to be sending him signals.But of course these guys have no idea what to do -- because the Farrellys have no idea what to do with them. Being garden-variety middle-aged geeks they head to Applebees with their makeshift posse of garden-variety middle-aged geek friends -- including one whos obsessed with poop AND is the obligatory wacky fat guy. So hes a twofer.The way this dude relieves himself on a golf course using the sand trap as a kitty-litter box isnt even the most obnoxious scatological gag in ""Hall Pass."" No that would belong to a young lady Fred picks up at a club and brings back to his hotel room. Lets just say the hardworking women of the housekeeping crew have their work cut out for them -- and the moment doesnt even earn the laugh it seeks.The wives meanwhile are enjoying their week off by flirting with minor-league baseball players on Cape Cod. A series of missed phone calls and misunderstandings later and both marriages are in contrived dire straits.Heres how bad ""Hall Pass"" gets Even Richard Jenkins with all his formidable skills and versatility cannot save this thing. He shows up in an unexpected bit of casting as Rick and Freds wealthy superstud friend. But then hes stuck with the same lame dialogue as everyone else.Christy Lemire is a film critic for The Associated Press. Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition.

Photo <<123>> In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers Drive Angry 3D Hall Pass How I Ended This Summer Nora s Will Vanishing on 7th Street We Were Here The Woman Chaser Interviews with the stars hot new trailers Ever since their 1998 modern classic ""Theres Something About Mary"" writers-directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly have struggled to try to recapture lightning in a bottle and conjure up yet another raunchy comedy with a heart of gold. They have come close a few times -- 2003s blissfully silly ""Stuck on You"" starring Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear as the worlds most wide-eyed conjoined twins remains widely underappreciated and 2005s ""Fever Pitch"" was an appealing PG-13-rated change of pace for the filmmakers. Yet most of their post-""Mary"" work reeks of a certain kind of Hollywood desperation The gags have become more deliberately ""shocking"" even as the emotions feel increasingly manufactured. Their latest effort ""Hall Pass"" starring Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis as a pair of married suburban men yearning for the freedom of youth falls right in line with the likes of ""Me Myself and Irene"" (2000) ""Shallow Hal"" (2001) and ""The Heartbreak Kid"" (2007). Any time a movie needs to resort to two sequences involving unexpected bowel moments for laughs you know youre in trouble. Wilson plays Rick perpetually horny after nearly 20 years of marriage to Maggie (Jenna Fischer). He and his best friend Fred (Sudeikis) similarly frustrated in his marriage to Grace (Christina Applegate) cant quite believe their luck when their wives give them a hall pass -- a week off from marriage to sleep with other women. The wives are inspired by a psychologist friend (Joy Behar awkward and miscast) who insists this strategy will save their relationships. Advertisement What follows is yet another slapdash bromance in which overgrown children must learn to finally become men (see also ""The Hangover"" ""Wedding Crashers"" ""I Love You Man"" and too many other titles of late to count). Except this one is especially slapdash with more than a dozen characters dropping in and out of the proceedings at will and illogical chaos erupting at every turn. (The climax involves a jealous barista/club DJ played by Derek Waters who smashes Freds minivan and then chases the two men from Providence R.I. to Cape Cod.) And while Sudeikis is a pleasant-enough second banana Wilson remains a little too lackadaisical and glibly above-it-all to play a convincing suburban schlump. The real disappointment is that the Farrelly brothers still have the capacity to push buttons and upend expectations; they serve up a side of subversion with their raunch. One soon-to-be-infamous sequence in ""Hall Pass"" features Rick being administered medical attention by a naked African-American man who rescues him from the hot tub at his gym (use your imagination). The Farrellys gleefully exploit stereotypes about race and homosexuality in a manner that is at first brazenly funny until it turns painfully uncomfortable. Its an all-too-brief reminder of the artistry behind the Farrellys brand of lowbrow comedy. Too bad the rest of ""Hall Pass"" is just lurching strained and forgettable.

"Hall Pass -- 2 stars - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Hall Pass -- 2 starsHall Pass characters neither funny nor alluringFebruary 24 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticJason Sudeikis and Owen Wilson in the Farrelly brothers disappointing ""Hall Pass.""Up until their remake of ""The Heartbreak Kid"" two of the unfunniest hours ever Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly could be counted on to provide a few fine rude laughs even when their films wobbled. Take for instance the shot of Jim Carrey attempting to go to the bathroom in ""Me Myself amp; Irene."" Its not repeatable its not tasteful its not a lot of things. But that 29-second shot -- crass enough to work as effrontery followed by a verbal kicker that explains the joke without killing it -- makes a good case for the Farrellys existence in general and cleverly staged single-take urination gags as executed by Carrey in particular."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""160""gt;Slinging bodily fluids all the way the Farrellys came to the fore with ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Theres Something About Mary."" Now many years later (a career and a half in Hollywood years) theyve been overtaken by Judd Apatows gang -- boy-men working often brilliantly in a more blase and deadpan vein. The Farrellys were never about subtlety.I waited for something half as funny as that ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" joke to arrive in their latest picture the disappointingly conventional ""Hall Pass."" It stars Owen Wilson bottom left and Jason Sudeikis top right as Rick and Fred married pals trying to score outside their marital playing fields with the one-week permission of their wives Maggie played by Jenna Fischer and Grace played by Christina Applegate. (This is the sort of screenplay that requires smart witty women such as Fischer and Applegate to make do with what they have.)Rick and Maggie are happy enough in their marriage luckier than most even. But sex has become a sometime thing their three kids (barely visible in the story) taking up most of their energy. Through a series of strained narrative developments involving two separate and embarrassing overheard conversations (one wouldve sufficed) the wives realize they have a couple of pathetic losers on their hands -- serial oglers hapless middle-age horndogs. So they give em a hall pass. The concept with its potential booty-call payoff is reiterated frequently and needlessly throughout the film. To wit ""You guys got a hall pass Live it up""The film blandly directed and atrociously lighted wanders from Ricks flirtation with an unrealistically gorgeous barista (Nicky Whelan) to Freds inept pickup attempts and then over to Maggie and Grace on vacation at the beach house (cue my raging class issues) where Fischers character captures the interest of a college baseball coach and Applegates goes for a player half her age. Like ""The Hangover"" ""Hall Pass"" asserts the primacy of home hearth and monogamy after all its poop and implant and masturbation routines have run their course. The film also takes for granted the inevitability of boys being boys and women enduring their mates eternal adolescence.I liked the epic buildup leading to the entrance of Farrelly regular Richard Jenkins (as the boys studly mentor) and the barista has an insanely jealous co-worker played by Derek Waters whose glowers are funnier than everybody elses dialogue. But its secondhand vaguely resigned material. And while Sudeikis has some talent hes not yet ready to co-anchor a feature comedy. Hes no Ed Helms in other words.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for crude and sexual humor throughout language some graphic nudity and drug use)Cast Owen Wilson (Rick); Jason Sudeikis (Fred); Jenna Fischer (Maggie); Christina Applegate (Grace); Nicky Whelan (Leigh); Richard Jenkins (Coakley)Credits Directed by Peter Farrelly and Bobby Farrelly; written by Pete Jones Peter Farrelly Kevin Barnett and Bobby Farrelly; produced by Bradley Thomas Charles B.

Hall Pass Bomb to bad Directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly. Cast Owen Wilson Jason Sudeikis Jenna Fischer Christina Applegate. Rating R for crude and sexual humor throughout language some graphic nudity and drug use. Guide to this weeks new releases Qamp;A Farrelly brothers pro-marriage ""Hall Pass"" their oddly mean-spirited latest film does not. Failing that some brains might be nice but that too seems a bridge too far. Its crude for sure relentlessly so but its also just dumb and when it tries to get something close to serious kind of depressing. And yet there are a few genuine laughs of the variety that make you question your judgment. Not as a movie critic. As a human being. Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis star as Rick and Fred middle-age married guys whose wandering eyes try the patience of their wives Maggie and Grace played by Jenna Fischer and Christina Applegate in both cases looking and acting as if they define the term ""better half."" On the advice of their friend Dr. Lucy (Joy Behar) the women give their husbands ""hall passes"" - a week to sow their oats as it were with no guilt and no strings attached. Interesting in theory but not in execution. The setup of course is that while the guys imagine a non-stop assembly line of beautiful women running through their bedrooms they are in fact so old and out of touch that no right-minded woman would pay them any attention (their first stop for pickups Applebees). Happily for them as with any Farrelly brothers movie there are a few women not in their right minds hanging around. Meanwhile Maggie and Grace who have gone on a mini vacation seem to have more luck in attracting the attention of men. (No kidding.) Theyre invited to parties with minor-league baseball players and managers as Rick and Fred while away the days in misadventures with their married buddies. (Note One of them is played by the brilliant Stephen Merchant. Originally I bumped the movie up a half-star just for his inclusion. Then I took it away because the Farrellys waste him so thoroughly.) Like many comedies ""Hall Pass"" is more a succession of gags and skits than an actual movie; when it reaches for something more than low-rent laughs it really slips. The attempted commentary on love fidelity and appreciation are off-putting a side plot about a violent psycho simply bizarre. Wilson doesnt seem to be trying and Fischer and Applegate typically game for anything are given nothing worthwhile to do. What laughs there are come mostly courtesy of Sudeikis and of all people Richard Jenkins in a surprising role. Also the description ""gross-out comedy"" has rarely been more apt. Except maybe for the comedy part. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

But Hall Pass a light comedy of horny marital woe from directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly makes a novel statement about the sex wars It says that theyre essentially over. And that the guys -- in case there was any lingering suspense about it -- have lost. Rick (Owen Wilson) a real estate agent who dresses in amazingly dweebish plaid shirts and Fred (Jason Sudeikis) a life-insurance salesman as genial and square as Howdy Doody are suburban schlubs devoted to their wives and (in Ricks case) family. When Rick isnt taking out the trash or disciplining his children with textbook New Dad sensitivity he like Fred has one topic on the brain all the sexy gorgeous women who as faithful and loving husbands they will never ever get to sleep with. All of which I know makes them sound like the most common and boorish of male movie characters. Except for one thing These two though they spend their hours fantasizing about straying would never dream of actually doing it. Theyre like neutered dogs who carry their own leashes. When it comes to satisfying their libidos theyre whipped defeated -- by the demands of family life (who has time for sex when youre trying to get the kids to bed?) or just by their loyalty. The raunchy chatter spills out of them and some of it is funny but mostly because its so pathetically vicarious. Hall Pass presents these men as a new archetype the frustrated middle-aged husband as randy adolescent virgin. Wilson geeked out in super-square hair knows how to use his gentleness to turn himself into a figure of soft desperation. And Saturday Night Lives Sudeikis in his first major movie role has an agreeably dorky bootlicking officiousness. (Fred thinks that hes scored a victory if he figures out how to look at a womans behind without his wife seeing him.) They are so domesticated the joke is they dont even know their pent-up sexual frustration is driving them nuts. It takes their wives Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and Grace (Christina Applegate) to figure that out and under the influence of a pop psychologist (Joy Behar) to propose a solution They will give their husbands a ""hall pass? a week off from marriage during which the two will be allowed to sow their wild oats -- and in theory purge all those demons of roving-eyed desire. Its a kind of high-concept therapy for a high-concept comedy that views the hidden and buried lusts of married men in the age of Internet porn as a ticklishly normal state of affairs. The Farrellys working from a script they co-wrote with Pete Jones and Kevin Barnett set all this up with an innocent dirty-minded aplomb. Still if Rick and Freds dilemma is the films amusing appetizer the main course ought to be what they actually do when theyre let loose. And the punchline is Out on their own Rick and Fred are such hapless inept womanizers that even when ""freed? theyre still trapped -- imprisoned -- in their overgrown-teenage heads. They treat Applebees as a pickup joint and eat themselves into a food coma. They scarf pot brownies on a golf course with even uglier results. And when they do try to hook up theyre so wild-and-crazy clueless about how seduction now works (""R-O-C-K in the USA? says Rick thinking that hes just said something cool which makes you want to dive under your seat) that women look at them as if they were another species. That however is a joke of diminishing returns. Hall Pass would like to be as dunked in reality as Judd Apatows best comedies but the movie is thin. The Farrellys cant quite nudge the characters from two dimensions to three. When Rick and Fred get lessons in humanity the movie seems to be about two sketch-comedy characters learning they have souls. As one of the girls they keep approaching might say Ewwww It would have helped if the women on screen from the wives to the ""perfect? Aussie coffee-bar babe (Nicky Whelan) were remotely interesting. But theyre not. Which raises the question How shrewdly can a comedy satirize the arrested male gaze when the movie itself is trapped in it? B?

Those 1990s gross-out kings Peter and Bobby Farrelly are finally growing up even if that maturation is visible only in highly relative terms. The siblings newest battle-of-the-sexes comedy ""Hall Pass"" contains just two instances of onscreen scatology (only one of which is explosive) and just three instances of frontal nudity (two of them male) but despite these good-faith efforts their attempts to embrace a marginally more adult approach never really come off. Still while the stabs at grown-up insight miss their targets pic still packs more pure comedic punch than the Farrellys last few offerings and should do healthy business. Three years after fellow 90s scatalogical auteur Kevin Smith tried to mine the gentler Apatovian landscape of bro-medy with ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" the brothers do likewise here losing most of their trademark grotesqueries and casting Owen Wilson in the lead as Rick a badly dressed rather relatable father of three. Rick is a decent enough guy -- he even refuses to buy beer for his kids 20-year-old babysitter an act of civic decency that would have been unthinkable in ""Kingpin"" -- though he does a poor job of keeping his girl-watching hidden from wife Maggie (Jenna Fischer). Much worse in that regard is his best friend Fred (Jason Sudeikis) whose wife Grace (Christina Applegate) is at her wits end with her spouses wandering eye even before hes arrested for masturbating in his car. The girls propose a rather extreme solution to the problem giving their husbands a ""hall pass"" or a week off from marriage in which to sow their wild oats while they abscond for a vacation. Fred is overjoyed by this turn of events Rick reluctant though they band together to make the most of it. The film is funniest in the early part of this adventure as these long-domesticated guys cruise for chicks in Applebees and face continual reminders of how long ago they were put out to pasture. (The truly awful pick-up lines they recite from Internet printouts are priceless.) Meanwhile their wives immediately stumble upon a vacationing college baseball team which provides for far better prospects. Wilson is always an affable presence and his scenes here are the best of the lot -- even when he locates an impossibly hot receptive fantasy girl (Aussie import Nicky Whelan) he maintains a self-effacing charm that keeps things just this side of believable. Sudeikis however veers more toward the ""Bachelor Party"" mold of wildly wayward husbands and his rapacious horndoggery eventually turns exhausting. Toward the end the film introduces a pair of vintage Farrelly types -- Richard Jenkins as a leather-clad lothario and Derek Waters as a psychotic coffee-shop waiter -- and loses all its earlier restraint sending its characters through crazed shootouts and chase scenes. Its a bit of a cop-out on the filmmakers part but it does pump some zany energy into what had become a precarious balancing act between the sleazy and the sincere. On a technical level ""Hall Pass"" looks pretty shoddy by studio standards though clean camerawork was obviously a secondary concern on set and it doesnt distract too terribly from the business at hand.

The gross-outs stick out in the Farrellys spotty new comedy. TWITTER Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis star as two fortysomethings attempting to play the field in the Farrellys latest comedy out in theaters Friday. The strain of the Farrelly brothers attempt to live up to their rudely comic younger selves is all too evident in Hall Pass an unbecoming and only fitfully funny account of two fortyish married guys making a final pathetic shot at playing the field. The storys central premise -- would you or could you cheat if given explicit permission for a limited period? -- possesses genuine fantasy appeal. However the Farrellys seem fatally torn between making a grown-up farce with a heartfelt message and delivering the gross-outs expected of them leaving the film in an unsatisfying vaguely depressing no mans land. Unexpectedly this jokey expose of male foibles and female vulnerabilities might play better to women than to men but overall commercial prospects look middling. Comically fixated on the plight of fellows whose wives fall asleep -- or pretend to -- in order to avoid nocturnal marital duties this is very much a film from a frustrated middle-aged male point of view. For Rick (Owen Wilson) the dilemma is exacerbated by having three young kids and his best pal Fred (Jason Sudeikis) sums up their attitude with the rhetorical query ""Doesnt it bother you that all of our wives dreams come true and ours dont?"" But the real problem for them as well as for their mates Maggie (Jenna Fischer) and Grace (Christina Applegate) respectively is the sense of being taken for granted of no longer feeling desired. This is a universal predicament that eventually gives birth here to the moral that you should appreciate what you have. But Peter and Bobby Farrelly working with co-writers Pete Jones and Kevin Barnett serve it with a gimmick Fed up with their husbands undisguised ogling of sexy women Maggie and Grace issue their hubbies a ""hall pass"" which entitles the boys to do whatever they want with whomever they want for a week during which time theyll stay out at the beach on Cape Cod. Punch-drunk with surprise at this offer the guys scarcely know what to say or do which is the beginning of the films numerous problems. How do they spend their first night of liberty? Pigging out with their three equally clueless poker buddies at Applebys. When the boys then waste another day with some dreadfully unfunny shenanigans at a country club (as if they would find any action there) the suspicion develops that the Farrellys have no better idea how to plot their movie than the guys have about how to go about picking up girls. Its under this cloud of desperation that the filmmakers finally drop their first trademark o-bomb (""o"" as in outrageous) in a male nude scene around a health club Jacuzzi; the sequence and the in-your-face genital close-ups come out of nowhere and feel cynically included just to provide the sort of WTF moment that at least since Theres Something About Mary audiences hope for from the Farrellys. A second equally arbitrary passage one that can be categorized under extreme potty humor involves a wasted dates accidental misuse of hotel bathroom facilities. By this point Rick has realized that his best shot at fulfilling his fantasy lies with Leigh (Nicky Whelan who could pass for Brooklyn Deckers Australian sister) an ultra-friendly barista at his favorite cafe. When the moment of truth arrives Ricks got to sort out his true priorities while Fred gets himself into a more unusual predicament. What the guys dont know and are probably better off not knowing is how extensively their wives have been fraternizing with some good-looking minor league baseball players up on the Cape. The slapstick and action comedy interludes are haphazardly executed at best and matters arent helped by the films incredibly ugly look; for whatever reason the productions from New Line Cinema since its absorption by Warner Bros. appear poorly lighted processed and/or printed resulting in blotchy bleachy results that do no favors to the actors. Looking pale pasty and out of shape Wilson lacks his usual sense of sneaky stealth behind the affability and his mere presence makes one yearn for the sort of genuine mischief he helped provoke in Wedding Crashers. Saturday Night Live regular Sudeikis supplies energy and enthusiasm if not inspired intangibles while Fischer is the picture of the desirable middle-class wife and mom. Applegates childless wife represents more of a question mark as without a few clues about this woman its impossible to guess what shes about. In a surprising bit of casting against type Richard Jenkins turns up late as an aging swinger full of cunning tips for his would-be proteges. The Farrellys beloved native Rhode Island has unfortunately been doubled here by Atlanta and environs obviously for financial reasons. Opens Friday Feb. 25 (Warner Bros.)

Rick is a girl watcher; Fred masturbates in the privacy of their parked Honda Odyssey (his predicament is throughout the less dignified). Under the guidance of a friend--Joy Behar of course--the wives decide they shouldnt let their husbands stew on ""the slow boat to resentment."" The girls retreat to Cape Cod with the kids gifting the guys with a week free from marital fidelity (and assuming the doofuses inability to cash in). This is the ""hall pass."" You will not forget the title as it is repeated four-score times during the movie.The husbands fantasize that theyre missing out; the wives fantasize that they are themselves content; contrasted Venus and Mars assumptions are challenged when they part. Anyone acquainted with the history of popular American screen comedy from Billy Wilder to Old School can guess that Hall Pass is not going to make an outright endorsement of free love. The idea is to make the trip to inevitable conclusions--something like ""Monogamy is impossible but anything else is worse""--funny and for a while Hall Pass does. Wilsons shy amused line readings and Sudeikiss prodding eyebrows have a rapport. Theyre great fun while egging each other on and boyishly wistful in introspective moments confessing married mens melancholy anxiety of never again having sex that doesnt involve a ""sense of duty."" As poker buddies the motley collection of J.B. Smoove Larry Joe Campbell and Stephen Merchant as an ascot-wearing brolly-toting semi-swish Englishman parody do fine supporting bull-session work. (Merchant has a closing-credits reappearance thats a short film in itself seemingly an editing-room afterthought once the filmmakers realized that enough hadnt been done with the character.)Still-timid Rick and Fred are advised early by their pals that it doesnt matter if they strike out--they should ""at least take a few swings."" A similar philosophy applies to the hack-away humor here with the Farrellys putting up Adam Dunn-type stats tons of whiffs but still more solidly hit laughs than in a dozen Couples Retreats. The Farrellys make hay from out-of-touch foolishness and the oblivious insensitivity of the young and desirable as Rick and Fred--their midsections spilling over pleated khakis giving off the aphrodisiac scent of mortgage payments--take their mission to get laid to Applebees. The Farrellys endless fascination for novel varieties of human types makes for some lively sight gags the angry boyfriend revealed to be a giant as he gets up from his barstool; dick-joke cutaways between Long Dong Silver and ""Irish inch"" stereotypes. Massage-parlor humor ugly sex-act slang and an ante-upping pair of bowel movements further fulfill the raunch quotient--which is exactly what this material feels like fulfilled obligation. The Farrellys sharing screenplay credit with Pete Jones and Kevin Barnett are coming off the longest break of their career here (its been four years since The Heartbreak Kid their last film) returning anxiously to proven formula. (Gonzo gross-out was struck from 2003s Stuck on You and 2005s Fever Pitch--cool funny movies if not glory-days hits.)The movies latter half travels between the wives vacation flirts Freds fumbling and Ricks chatting up a gorgeous barista (Nicky Whelan) irking her Hobbit-like co-worker (Derek Waters) until behind-the-counter passive aggression explodes into psychosis. This occurs immediately after Rick and Fred have received word that a loved one may be dead or injured. The Farrellys made their reputation by toggling smoothly between incongruous saccharine and lewd registers--a routine that has since become ubiquitous in the Vaughn Stiller and Sandler oeuvres. The crazy-barista melodrama-slapstick collision seems not like a nimble twist but tone-deaf blundering--what once came naturally now seems like trying too hard as the Farrellys face their own mid-life crisis.
