Directed by Ignacio Ferreras a disciple of Sylvain Chomet (The Triplets of Belleville) and dubbed into English from Spanish this animated gem tells a story of friendship in an old folks home. Emilio (Martin Sheen) is dumped there by his son after one too many senior moments while Miguel (George Coe) a white-haired Randle McMurphy cuts deals and runs the joint. The animation artfully transitions between what is real and what the aging residents think is real. Rare is the ""cartoon"" that penetrates and even haunts; Wrinkles is not easily forgotten. (Available on iTunes and VOD July 15) A- -Jeff Labrecque Bound by Flesh NR 1 HR. 30 MINS. In the 1920s Daisy and Violet Hilton were one of the most popular acts in vaudeville. They were charming and pretty and could play a host of instruments. What really set them apart though was that they were conjoined twins attached back-to-back. Leslie Zemeckis documentary about their curious and ultimately sad lives is a fascinating snapshot of the era of nickel-a-peek circus sideshows. Its also an unexpectedly touching tale Late in life when they were asked by a doctor if they wanted to be separated they said they did not. (Also available on VOD) B -Chris Nashawaty Earth to Echo PG 1 HR. 29 MINS. Three boys from a Nevada suburb find a chirping chunk of space junk in this anemic entry in the WWSSD (What Would Steven Spielberg Do?) subgenre. The mildewed found-footage technique allows some tension to build from offscreen action but also renders the knockoff John Williams score inexplicable. And incessant exclamations about the unbreakable bond of friendship are only interesting given that Earth to Echos original studio Disney was evidently not moved by all the loyalty hokum and pawned off the finished movie to the highest bidder. C- -Joe McGovern Me and You NR 1 HR. 27 MINS. Bernardo Bertolucci has made plenty of films that are decidedly not for children (Last Tango in Paris for instance or The Dreamers). But his latest could almost be considered YA. In this chamber drama a teenage social misfit pretending to be on a ski trip hides from his parents in the basement of his apartment building. There he crosses paths with his half sister a heroin junkie using the space to detox. The movie is slight but observant and not nearly as maestro-batory as some of Bertoluccis other work. B -Keith Staskiewicz Policeman NR 1 HR. 47 MINS. The few Israeli films that find their way to U.S. theaters tend to focus on the ongoing war between Jews and Palestinians. Director Nadav Lapids debut bucks expectations by showing us a threat from within. The slow-building import nicely captures the macho band-of-brothers bond of one Israeli counter-terrorism unit before its called in to rescue wedding guests taken hostage by Jewish leftists waging class war. But thats the only spark this otherwise chilly and remote film has to offer.

Deep in suburban America a trio of 13-year-old boys find a cute alien whos crashed to earth. But as they make friends with the visitor sinister forces of adult officialdom swoop in. You can imagine ET phoning his legal team but although this kids sci-fi adventure is derivative its characters are drawn with more care and insight than youd expect. Just kids is all this lot ever hear from patronising grown-ups so the storys ongoing chase scenario all filmed on their smartphones gives them some experience of the big bad world (driving cars venturing into bars). That yearning to be taken seriously will chime with the intended PG audience. And although the boys bond with the creature (a sort of metallic baby owl) generates little aww-factor the credible special effects and agreeable cast almost make up for it. This is a surprisingly likeable little movie.

By Ben Sachs 1bsachs Reese Hartwig Ella Wahlestedt Brian ""Astro"" Bradley and Teo Halm Earth to Echo  Directed by Dave Green I cant say that Earth to Echo fails totally as childrens entertainment; the grade-schoolers at the preview screening I attended seemed to enjoy it just fine. Yet Ive seen grade-schoolers transfixed by TV commercials as well and no responsible parent (or so I hope) would show a child advertisements for 90 minutes straight. Echo often feels like a feature-length smartphone commercial; when it doesnt it comes off as an inept knockoff of Steven Spielbergs E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) and J.J. Abramss Spielberg pastiche Super 8 (2011). If the movie is a waste at least its an instructive one signaling just how offensive childrens entertainment might become in the YouTube era. Like many recent horror movies Echo takes the form of a found-footage documentary. The protagonists are three tech-savvy preteen boys who constantly document their lives on smartphones and make YouTube videos out of the material. Director Dave Green (working from a script by Henry Gayden) presents their compulsive self-recording as though it were a natural part of growing up and not solipsistic or creepy. Regardless of the ethical implications this approach makes for particularly uninspired filmmaking. Theres not a single decently framed shot in the film and the visual syntax modeled all too closely on amateur YouTube videos perpetuates the misguided notion that theres no difference between a theater projection and the display screen of a phone. So much for the wonder of the movies. The young heroes describe themselves as outsiders though the child actors who play them are so bland and poised that its hard to believe this most basic aspect of the plot. As the film opens the upper-middle-class Nevada suburb where they live is about to be demolished to make way for a new interstate (a weird allusion to eminent-domain-related controversies that probably holds no interest for the target audience). Strange things start happening around town in the days leading up to the demolition all cell phones break down at once and government agents collect the damaged goods citing some vague federal protocol. Too attached to their phones to relinquish them the boys hide them from the feds. Soon their phones start receiving odd visual messages; one of these turns out to be a map and the boys follow it into the desert one night where they discover an extraterrestrial has crash-landed. The boys greet their discovery with the sort of belabored ersatz enthusiasm one finds in toy commercials; that the alien--a metallic little guy who lights up when people talk to it--resembles a toy only reinforces the association. In the second half of Earth to Echo the kids spend a long night helping the creature find parts for its broken spaceship evading the feds who want to capture it and recording lots of cool images for their YouTube channel. ""Your friends are still your friends even if theyre far away"" one of the boys narrates in the final moments. Perhaps the alien can access their vlog from outer space.

But Dave Greens charming ""Earth to Echo"" provides a welcome respite for audiences looking for an adventure film that can appeal to the entire family. Combining some classic plot movements and plenty of modern trappings (just like a lot of cell phones) ""Earth to Echo"" is a sweet family film that has something for everyone (even fans of found footage films and people prone to suspecting the government of evil-doing) all wrapped up inside a plot that never feels preachy or pandering. Focused on the final days of fictional Mulberry Woods Nevada a suburban enclave thats set to be demolished to make room for an ever-expanding freeway ""Earth to Echo"" is all about growing changing and maturing - even when we dont want to. The tweens at the heart of the film - Tuck (Astro also known as Brian Bradley) Munch (Reese Hartwig) and Alex (Teo Halm) - have been battling the imminent expansion for some time knowing that if their home is destroyed they will all be forced to move away from each other. Their efforts have proven fruitless and the trio is in the middle of settling up their goodbyes when an adventure (perfect for their last night together) unfurls before their very eyes. The boys - ""good kids"" all of them - are best pals the kind bonded by their varying degrees of weirdness Munch is smart and finicky Tuck is constantly filming everything and Alex is a foster kid with big trust issues. Theyve also bonded on their apparent interest in old school adventuring so its no surprise that when something wacky starts happening around Mulberry Woods the trio continually push each others curiosity. Its a basic enough thing just some cell phones acting weird but the bored boys pursue the strange activity until they discover that the ""barf"" that has attacked their phone screens is really a map. Intent on making their final night together memorable they follow the map. Its no secret that the map eventually leads them to a tiny alien being - the eponymous Echo a charming little metal dude who looks a bit like an owl made by steampunks - who needs their help in a big way. Adventure Echos ability to make maps (and to zing them to any and all nearby cell phones) doesnt let up when the boys discover him and the trio soon realizes that the fresh maps that instantly appear on Tucks phone are meant to be followed if only to save the ailing Echo. Both Echo and his tiny craft have been injured and its up to the boys to take their new pal who exhibits a startling ability to manipulate technology on a wild and energetic treasure-hunting mission. Despite a quick start and a compelling plot the films early energy wanes a bit towards its middle which is exactly when the trio (plus alien friend) unexpectedly balloons out to include a fourth (well a fourth human) Ella Wahlestedts Emma who adds spunk and bravery to the group just as they need it the most. The addition of Emma (and of some well-made and appropriately scary bad guys and tense situations) helps drive ""Earth to Echo"" over the finish line in sweet and memorable style. The film is kitted out with some recognizable tropes - its even got an evil land developer at its core sort of - but its also bolstered by the injection of some very modern trappings. Filmed entirely on kid-owned cameras including tech-head Tucks camcorder digital camera and unwieldy spyglasses the film has the look and energy of a found footage feature with the feel and soul of a more traditional feature. The films design scheme echoes the kids tech savvy skills - text messages computers screens video chats Google maps and the like all float up on to the screen with regularity - and while its often feels a bit too much it helps the classic story feel modern enough to engage iPhone-eyed audience members. ""Earth to Echo"" is doubtless made from the same mold as ""E.T."" and ""Explorers"" and ""The Goonies"" and while that also means its not exceedingly original it is well-made and a solid entry into the subgenre. Its also the kind of film that will inspire its audience to seek out the features that inspired it that hey maybe they really are still making these days.

Trying too hard to be the Steven Spielberg classic. Watch a clip from the film ""Earth to Echo."" Starring Teo Halm Astro and Reese Hartwig. (Photo/Video Relativity Media) By John Anderson July 2 2014 455 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Amid a soulless expanse of Western tract housing young kids alienated from their own life form make contact with one from another planet. Entrusted with keeping the worlds biggest secret they adopt the paranoid secrecy of the typical preadolescent telling no one about their discovery while they try to help the cute little extraterrestrial find his way home. Obstacles? Parents who dont know what the heck is going on and a menacing U.S. government that does. More Reviews Tammy Venus in Fur A Hard Days Night While almost no one phones home in Dave Greens ""Earth to Echo"" the comparisons to Steven Spielbergs ""E.T."" are impossible to avoid. As are the parallels to ""Stand By Me"" The friendship between Alex (Teo Halm) Tuck (Astro aka Brian Bradley) and Munch (Reese Hartwig) is meant to represent the kind that can only exist among 12-year-old boys and that is about to be shattered by an inexplicable freeway expansion poised to obliterate their Nevada neighborhood. When their cellphones start acting strangely they get suspicious and trace the interference to a ""construction"" site in the desert. There they make contact with the marooned alien they call Echo and--with their families packed and ready to leave--have to work fast to ship him home. If we had to guess which we do wed say that Disney sold off ""Earth to Echo"" last year to the films current distributor Relativity Media not so much because its bad which it is but because of a style of storytelling antithetical to its brand. The efforts made by first-time feature director Dave Green to create whats been called ""the millennials E.T."" include a misguided reliance on shaky-cam photography meant to simulate Alexs blog but which makes ""Earth to Echo"" off-putting both aesthetically and narratively. Unlike the very successful Spanish horror thriller ""[Rec]"" or even the nausea-inducing ""Cloverfield"" which ""Echo"" more closely resembles this film doesnt maintain a consistent point of view or any logic about whats on screen. Even younger viewers who might respond to media theyre familiar with and the cheap immediacy of the hand-held camera will instinctively question whos shooting what and why and how. The young actors are close to unbearable with the exception of Ella Wahlestedt who plays Emma the young beauty who leaves the boys tongue-tied and is sharper than any of them. Her name and her brain provide shoddy allusions to ""Harry Potter"" but her arrival does inject life into an adventure thats been dominated by Alexs repetitious rhetoric (""Thats amazing"" ""That is insane"") and a story that has spent a lot of time spinning its wheels out in the desert. The script which tries too hard to mimic contemporary adolescence is by Henry Gayden. The music which has to carry more than its share of emotional weight is by Joseph Trapanese.

The movie is jockeying to be as producer Andrew Panay has said this generations "" Stand by Me""-meets-"" The Goonies."" ""Echo"" opens with a sketchy highway construction project threatening to uproot a tightly knit suburb of families and friends in Nevada. The main storyteller here is Tuck ( Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) a kid struggling to grow up in the shadow of his popular athletic big brother. Along with his two best friends -- Munch ( Reese Hartwig) a hoarder and Alex ( Teo Halm) a foster kid -- the posse pledges to live up their last night together and investigate an electronic mystery plaguing their cell phones. The boys bike to the desert to discover a robot alien who wants nothing more than to rebuild his spaceship and return home. (Its plot is uncannily comparable to "" E.T."" -- just with a more post-modern approach.) Tuck breaks the fourth wall films the action on his arsenal of gadgets (or so it appears) and provides snippets of the movies sound track via his computer. Director Dave Green and scribe Henry Gaydencraft as real and relatable a world as they can given the infusion of sci-fi and the PG rating. ""Echo"" sprints out of the gate and sometimes relies too much on its influences (which unabashedly show tinges of "" Super 8"" ""E.T."" ""The Goonies"" and ""Stand by Me"") to sell its story. The film does a good job however of maintaining its own voice; it brings veiled mature themes to the table and fashions a subtle edge. Popularity partying and money are parodied in bite-sized moments and the young stable of characters all have their own parent-related problems at home. The movies quick run time doesnt leave much leeway for in-depth character development but story trumps all in this movie -- it even has a moral tacked on its end. Despite toned-down language ""Echo"" pastiches the themes of independence camaraderie adventure and rebellion that made ""The Goonies"" and ""Stand by Me"" cultural stand-outs. In the place of profanity quippy one-liners -- featuring barf and your-mom jokes -- punctuate the script. The cast of fresh faces -- including Ella Wahlestedt-- gives solid performances as genuine junior high kids (with Hartwig stealing the comic spotlight). Though some hard-to-shake vestiges remain ""Echo"" does its best to avoid the cheesy tropes and archetypes of many family adventure movies. Echo the alien is equal parts adorable and awesome with a cute demeanor sleek design and a penchant for taking apart and putting together metals (think good-natured Magneto). In conjunction with moments of dazzling special effects the movie morphs into a visually and aurally pleasing display of found-footage pizzazz. With authentic characters dialogue and settings ""Echos"" filmmakers have successfully created a story younger kids and pre-teens growing up in a Millennial and post-Millennial culture can relate to. Whether the films voice will stick as a cultural echo will depend on its timing -- which stacked up against some of this summers other popcorn flicks may or may not be in its favor.

Grade C- The makers of ""Earth to Echo"" said inspiration struck when they realized that if they updated the story of Steven Spielbergs ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" the youthful heroes would be making a film of it themselves with their camera-equipped gadgets. Too bad the filmmakers ""Eureka"" moment is the audiences ""Oh no-o-o-o"" experience. If the film had concentrated on its characters instead of mimicking their amateur footage ""Earth to Echo"" could have been a contender in this seasons YA fantasy sweepstakes. Instead its hard to love and even harder to watch. Director Dave Green and screenwriter Henry Gayden build DIY filmmaking into the bones of this film about three suburban Nevada boys discovering an extraterrestrial in the Mojave Desert. The unlikely protagonists find this mini-E.T. when misfit genius Munch (Reese Hartwig) discovers that splatter patterns popping up on smartphones are a map. They start recording their adventure because Tuck (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) is a camera nut determined to capture their final outing before their housing development is razed for a new highway dispersing the friends and their families forever. Emma (Ella Wahlestedt) is supposed to offer suggestions of prepubescent romance just as the third buddy Alex (Teo Halm) is meant to provide qualities of soul. An orphan and a foster child he allegedly bonds with the robotic alien owl they dub ""Echo."" Spielbergs E.T. so ugly it was cute was also full of personality. Echo is adorable and forgettable and the rest of the characters are simply plot holders in a narrative contraption that generates jeopardy-raising obstacles to Echo going home. The tweens are like overgrown Little Rascals without the charming shticks. Green is not a child actors director or an adult actors director either. He mistakes awkwardness for freshness in the kids and his most intriguing grown-ups are shadowy figures wielding flashlights. Youthful filmmakers often assume that odd angles and hyperactive cutting achieve excitement. The opposite happens in ""Earth to Echo."" The movie puts you into a somnolent state. The amateur footage might have acquired magic or dignity if the wonder of meeting Echo had inspired the kids to use their cameras confidently and eloquently. In Spielbergs ""E.T."" the door to the spaceship closed like the lens of a camera as if to suggest that the alien ignited the movies limpid lyrical style. What we get in ""Earth to Echo"" is a bush-league mess.

T. for the iPhone Age Thursday July 3 2014 at 1 a.m. By Amy Nicholson Munch (Reese Hartwig) encounters Echo a small alien who has become stranded on Earth. Earth to Echo is a slender kiddie flick about a quartet of preteens and their palm-sized alien pal which is at once bland well-intentioned and utterly terrifying about the mental development of modern children. As in the most honest kids films our pint-size heroes admit to being isolated unhappy and cowed by the adult world. Their Nevada suburb will be torn down tomorrow scattering these three best friends -- braggadocious Tuck (the one-named Astro from X-Factor) chubby and cowardly Munch (Reese Hartwig) and unthreateningly handsome Alex (Teo Halm) -- to different schools and plucking the cute blonde (Ella Wahlestedt) they all crush on out of their universe before she even knew they shared one. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The film posits that the youth of today are useless without their pocket computers.On their last night together the guys dupe their parents with a fake slumber party reroute the grown-ups incoming calls to Munchs cell and bike off into the desert to track down a blinking treasure mysteriously beamed to their smartphone maps. (Sir Walter Raleigh would look up from his battered scrolls and sadly shake his head.) The big-mouthed Tuck a tyke whos always blurting his own name like the abandoned son of Kanye West has brought along a video camera as his interest in the quest itself is dwarfed by the possibility of shooting the next viral hit. After all whats the point of meeting an alien if theres no record of it on YouTube?Film Details Earth to Echo RatingPG GenreAction/Adventure Running Time89 min. More Info Trailer Director Dave Green is less a feature filmmaker than a juggler of screens. The found-footage gimmick -- Earth to Echos background canvas -- is simply a gateway that allows for the visual shorthand of the boys shoving their phones at the lens. Instead of plunging into the woods they stare at their GPS while swashbuckling through strip malls and the occasional small-town Main Street. Occasionally Green zooms out for the Google Earth view of their quest complete with an arrow pointing toward their location. The result feels both techno-immediate and emotionally distancing There are so many cameras between us and the action that its like attending a Pink Floyd laser light show and watching the magic through the recorder on your iPhone.Perhaps Green and writer Henry Gayden think that electronic artifice is the best way to tell a story to tweens.

Though its from outer space its retrofitted for Radio Shack It speaks in ringtones and uses their phone cameras for eyes. Forget the old-man wrinkles of E.T.; Earth to Echo seems to have found through focus testing that children no longer want blood or bile -- they want sanitized bleeps. Instead of wooing their discovery with Reeses Pieces these kids dote over his battery charge and when they attempt to strengthen his legs with pen caps were caught off guard by the fact that these kids still have pens.The thing is so cute that they inevitably fall in love -- it resembles a robotic lemur -- but at the same time we suspect they cant quite accept that its sentient. In a dramatic near-death moment one boy cries ""Please you have to work"" not the biologically accurate ""Please you have to live""Their new friend sends them on a quest to find the missing parts needed to help launch his spaceship. They are scattered everywhere that young boys find mysterious and alarming a bar a pawn shop a dark arcade a beautiful babes bedroom. They ping around Nevada fast enough that theres scarcely time to question the plot. (How on earth did a piece of the aliens key get into a girls jewelry box?) On their heels are some not-scary-enough adults who are most alarming when they forcibly escort the gang to their control center which houses an entire wall mounted with commandeered cellphones pinned in neat rows like dead butterflies.Earth to Echo has scant thrills on its own terms but is deeply disturbing in the margins. Without chagrin or alarm bells it posits that the youth of today are useless without their pocket computers -- when swiping a getaway car the first thing they do is Google how to drive. The films final thesis is that distance between friends be it suburban or planetary doesnt matter as long as you can text. Earth to Echo has officially cursed the next generation to hermetic solitude.On a baser level it blithely takes for granted that children trust gizmos more than grown-ups. Despite a government worker warning them -- correctly -- that the aliens underground spaceship is so big that it could rip up their town like a dandelion they barely blink before continuing to rank this strange beings happiness over their parents houses the triumph of the childish good over the ethical right.Future intergalactic overlords Forget bombing the White House just ask a hacker whiz kid to do you a solid.EARTH TO ECHO | Directed by Dave Green | Written by Henry Gayden | Relativity Media | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The most derivative movie of the summer Earth To Echo is also the most visually unpredictable chock-full of degraded digital textures that seem ready to boil off the screen picture-boxed within Mac desktops and overlaid with extraterrestrial interface trees.The plot is secondhand Spielbergiana a copy of a copy. Three generic suburban boys--Tuck (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) Alex (Teo Halm) and Munch (Reese Hartwig)--follow a mysterious smartphone signal into the Nevada desert where they discover a cutesy clicky alien which resembles a robotic screech owl. It needs help repairing itself so they set off into the night on their bikes to scrounge up parts all the while dodging government agents disguised as construction workers. Eventually they are joined by a token girl Emma (Ella Wahlestedt). This is framed through an eclectic found-footage gimmick which mixes cameras and computers with the aliens own point of view. Google maps and street view are used to represent the characters traveling from one place to another. Windows with pertinent information hover in the margins of the screen. At one point during a webcam conversation with Munch and Alex Tuck alt-tabs into iTunes to put on the Robin Hood Prince Of Thieves soundtrack. The kids cameras strike extreme unusual angles floor-level static shots compositions framed around the underside of Tucks chin near-fisheye wide shots. At one point Tuck mounts a GoPro to the rear pegs of his BMX bike. The resulting composition puts his foot in the left third of the frame and his friends backs in the middle; blades of grass brush past the lens and a star-dotted night sky fills up the top of the screen toppling sideways when Tuck comes to a stop and lets the bike drop out from under him. Earlier shots with the GoPro mounted to the handlebars turn the hills and back alleys of the kids suburban development into a roller coaster bounded by driveways and garbage cans.Later on the movie periodically adopts the perspective of the alien dubbed ""Echo"" for its tendency to mimic sounds. Images melt away leaving trickling blotches; skeletal frameworks circled by hieroglyphs assemble across the screen. Its one of those cases where a hokey Hollywood movie inadvertently replicates the audiovisual pleasures of experimental film--in this case a contemporary strain of video art that uses digital generation loss to turn mundane subjects into deformed canvasses. The often unconvincing effects (including a bit with a semi thats great in concept but slapdash in execution) contribute to Earth To Echos deteriorating texture. In many ways the aesthetic is of a piece with the narrative which is composed of pieces from Explorers Super 8 and Batteries Not Included (the kids homes are even under threat of demolition) corrupted by generations of copying until they seem less like elements of a story than meaningless beats. The movies continually reiterated theme of lasting friendship is unlikely to affect even the most impressionable young viewers; grown-ups however might get a kick out of seeing something so weird-looking stretched across the multiplex screen.

"Earth to Echo | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; earth-to-echo ) Earth to Echo (United States 2014) July 02 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli I suppose it would be fair to characterize Earth to Echo as an homage to E.T. Or at least I assume thats what director Dave Green and screenwriter Henry Gayden were going for a gentle throw-back to the kinder sorts of science fiction films of the 70s and 80s helmed by Spielberg and his likes. (There are a few nods to Close Encounters of the Third Kind as well). Those were movies in which aliens were the good guys and people particularly those associated with the government were the ones to be feared and mistrusted. There are however a couple of fatal flaws in Earth to Echos approach. First the script is dumb. This isnt a family-friendly film - anyone over the age of about 8 will immediately recognize that significant chunks of the story dont make sense. Secondly the decision to use a ""found footage""/first-person approach to the presentation is not only distracting but is so ineptly handled that it will cause those prone to motion sickness to be retching in the aisles. The story is straightforward. Three childhood friends - Alex (Teo Halm) Tuck (Astro) and Munch (Reese C. Hartwig) - are spending a final night together. The next day they all have to move out of their development to make way for a highway. Strange things have been happening with their cellphones and they set out to investigate. This takes them on a night journey across the desert where they discover a small robot alien that has been damaged in a crash and is trying to find its way to a spaceship. Joined by classmate Emma (Ella Wahlestedt) the boys help out the robot while being pursued by Federal Agents who want the alien for nefarious purposes. There are four simple things to remember about Earth to Echo (1) the alien is impossibly cute (2) the kids are all smart and wise (3) the parents are morons and (4) the Feds are evil. That pretty much sums up character development. Earth to Echo doesnt contain an ounce of sophistication. Its so derivative of E.T. that Melissa Mathison should sue for a story credit. (Even the poster is an obvious rip-off of E.T.) The problem is that Earth to Echo somehow manages to discard almost everything that was good and magical in the Spielberg movie while retaining the weak and/or forgettable elements. Which brings us to the so-called ""found footage"" approacha| One question is foremost in my mind Why? The film is presented through video taken by the protagonists. I suppose this was clever the first few times it was done (mostly in horror films like The Blair Witch Project) but its the kind of gimmick that quickly wears out its welcome. An additional impediment is that the constant shaking and panning of the hand-held camera may trigger nausea in some viewers. And even for those not subject to motion picture motion sickness the format is more distracting than innovative or interesting. It could be argued that a style like this is employed in an attempt to cover up other inadequacies. The acting is adequate at best and sometimes not convincing. None of the four principals has a lengthy filmography and one of them Astro is best known for his participation in the TV singing competition ""The X Factor."" The director Dave Green is making his feature debut after having done some TV work and crafting several short films. Earth to Echo has a made-for-Disney Channel feel with limited production values and video game quality special effects. Still stepping back for a moment and recognizing that this was made with kids in mind its a passable diversion and certainly no worse than what many children watch on TV (or online). Its just a shame it couldnt have been made a little more bearable for the adults who will accompany their offspring to theaters.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Jul. 02 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Jul. 02 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Dave Green Written by Henry Gayden Starring Teo Halm Brian Bradley Reese Hartwig Ella Wahlestedt Classification PG Country USA Language English If I were a hostile alien life form bent on conquering Earth Id build a huge mirror field around the planet and just let it get bombarded by its own trash bouncing back. No need for messy invasions or costly urban Armageddons just strafe the suckers with the endless blowback of their own pop-cultural transmissions. Then sit back and watch. Many summers ago this was the premise of Joe Dantes subversively inspired Explorers in which a group of suburban kids discover an extraterrestrial entity completely saturated and rendered suitably stupid by wayward earthly TV signals. A cheeky retort to such sugary Spielbergian space-invader fantasies as Close Encounters and E.T. Dantes movie reformulated the old Pogo the possum dictum of meeting the enemy (""and he is us"") for a world too fixated on its own propensity for amusement to even notice its being outsourced to off-world interests.As the title suggests Dave Greens Earth to Echo is an exercise in retrofitted preteen world-saving space shenanigans specifically (and unavoidably) a digital remastering of E.T. for the smartphone social-media kinderkultur.On the eve of their suburban Nevada neighbourhoods paving over to make way for a superhighway three variously disenfranchised but charmingly precocious kids - Alex (Teo Halm) Tuck (Brian Bradley) and Munch (Reese Hartwig) - notice that their phones have gone all kaflooey and determine the interference is actually a map a signal that draws them deep into the desert (on BMX bikes natch) to come to the aid of a homesick space pilgrim that looks like a backpack-sized android owl designed by a Japanese toy company.Unfolding largely through the recorded images the boys technology and temperament elevates to second nature Greens movie is all skittish surfaces POV joyrides and glimpses of life lived as a kind of permanent YouTube performance. This premise holds the potential for a Dante-like takedown of a world where nothing is real unless its virtually rendered and where the experience of childhood itself has been processed into a state of hyper self-aware reality programming. But Earth to Echo is far less inclined to jam the prevailing culture of cradle-to-grave digital narcissism than sell it as liberating the medium by which kids save the world send shiny toy aliens home to theirs and generally assert control over everything. Until of course the next generation of technology comes along and you have to ask your parents to pay for it.Would that the movie had gone the next step and possibly imagined that this bright shiny little E.T. had figured out how to get kids to do its sinister work for him by providing free WiFi and endless smartphone upgrades in exchange for undying loyalty we might have had something altogether different on our hands. Then again Explorers was a flop. Just Google it on your phone and youll see.

You get innocence and wide-eyed wonder on one side savvy ""realism"" on the other. Thus ordered so delivered Dave Greens Earth to Echo has just enough teen angst to toughen up its adorability and to temper its predictability. Its a simplistic movie but theres a darkness to it. The film opens on a montage of kids lamenting to the camera that their small suburban neighborhood of Mulberry Woods Nevada is about to be mowed over to make room for a freeway. All the families are moving to different places which means that our three 13-year-old heroes are about to go their separate ways. ""Thanks for paving over the only place where Ive ever had any friends"" brooding foster kid Alex Nichols (Teo Halm) tells us. ""Theyre the only ones who get me"" says oddball tech-wizard Reginald ""Munch"" Barnett (Reese Hartwig). ""Im an acquired taste."" Its all being captured on camera by Tuck Sims (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) who articulates the films themes of friendship and vulnerable adolescent powerlessness. ""Youre going along feeling like your own person with your own friends. And then something like this comes along that you have no power to stop. Cause youre just a kid."" Before you can say ""E.T. phone home"" adolescent empowerment arrives in the form of weird haywire patterns appearing on the kids phones (which they call ""barfing""). Upon discovering that the images might be maps the kids pack their bags grab their bikes cue the Robin Hood Prince of Thieves soundtrack and head out to investigate. (""Were gonna ride our bikes out into the desert without adult supervision"" Tuck yells at his distracted family who just nod obliviously. He adds just to check if theyre listening ""Also rob a bank. And go to Mexico."" Nothing.) They soon come upon a weird metallic object and inside that weird metallic object an alien that looks like a cross between a robot owl and a baseball. Via additional phone signals the alien whom the kids christen Echo sends them to more locations where different pieces start to attach themselves to the object they found in the desert. Each piece seems to make Echo stronger. Along the way the three boys also hook up with a pretty classmate Emma (Ella Wahlestedt) who had previously seemed out of their league but who turns out to be a geek at heart as well. And needless to say as in E.T. there are some shady-looking adults who are very interested in this creature and theyre not so keen on making friends. Even though they see in the alien a fellow castaway the kids relationship with Echo is curiously inert. Earth to Echo is much more about the bond between these children who are about to lose each other than it is about their bond with the alien. In E.T. the young protagonist Elliots relationships and attitude were changed by his interaction with the extra-terrestrial He became more compassionate more in tune with the people around him more confident. The kids in Earth to Echo just find affirmation that being alone sucks ""He was out in the middle of nowhere on his own like us"" they say. Its a poignant reflection but Henry Gaydens script doesnt work it so much as wallow in it. But by putting these kids in a uniquely vulnerable situation -- theyre about to lose their homes and their friends and adults dont seem to give a crap -- the film does gain a kind of urgency. And the found-footage style which creates the illusion of these adolescents controlling their own narrative enhances that immediacy. But are they in control? Im not sure. The alien brings these boys very little joy or even accomplishment. Even so Earth to Echo captures the darkness and uncertainty of that transition between childhood and the teenage years when youve transcended one world and are on the cusp of another. Weve all been there Its a breathtaking and terrible place to be exploding with possibility and wonder emotional treachery and helplessness. The film cant quite reflect that complexity but it evokes it. Earth to Echo resonates despite itself.

In Steven Spielbergs sci-fi classic a lonely boy in a planned residential development met up with a lost desperate but kind-of-cute alien - and with nothing but pluck and his bicycle evaded some stupid grownups to get him safely home. In ""Earth to Echo"" three lonely boys and a girl in a planned residential development meet up with a lost desperate but kind-of-cute alien - and with nothing but pluck and their bicycles evade stupid grownups to get him safely home. The poster for the new film even has a boys finger reaching out to touch the little extraterrestrial visitor - while his ""heart light"" as Neil Diamond would call it shines a bright blue. No I dont know where they got their ideas either. There are some new things in ""Earth to Echo"" of course. Unfortunately theyre the things that dont work. Like switching out Spielbergs typically clean perfectly framed vistas with a lot of shaky handheld shots supposedly coming to us via camcorders smartphones and the aliens own owlish too-cute eyes. Or replacing that films heartfelt and often hilarious performances - remember little Drew Barrymores scream? - with almost uniformly bad work from kid actors who I seriously hope have college funds. The worst is someone who calls himself Astro - and as he has the lead were stuck with his shouted boasts and stupid swaggering attitude throughout. (Were told hes from New York as if that explains or excuses it.) But the other young actors -- Teo Helm Reese Hartwig and Ella Wahlestedt - arent better just quieter. None of them seem like real kids let alone friends - theyre neither natural enough to be believable nor skilled enough to become someone else. The new plot such as it is has the three boys (the girl joins up later) finding what looks like an old shell casing in the desert. Actually its a tiny rocket and inside is this - well Im not sure what it is but it looks like a cyborg owl and beeps like a failing smoke detector. And it soon has them on an all-night scavenger hunt as they try to find spare parts and elude the Evil Guys in Jumpsuits on their trail. Its not particularly logical and its not particularly fun and as deliberately amateur as the herky-jerky photography is the rest of the film isnt much more professional. (Disney made it then - wisely -- sold it off to another studio.) But at least the title is honest. The whole movies an echo - of something better and far more original now bounced back at us more and more quietly until it finally fades away. Ratings note The film contains some mildly strong language. Earth to Echo (PG) Relativity (100 min.) Directed by Dave Green. With Teo Helm Astro Reese Hartwig. Ella Wahlestedt Jason Gray-Stanford.

"Review Earth to Echo an E.T. knockoff is pleasantly diverting - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Earth to Echo an E.T. knockoff is pleasantly diverting ""Earth to Echo"" Relativity Media Reese Hartwig stars in ""Earth to Echo."" Reese Hartwig stars in ""Earth to Echo."" (Relativity Media) Gary Goldstein Three 13-year-olds discover a robotic owl-like space alien in the Nevada desert. Its Earth to Echo. Its no ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial."" (What is?) But on its own modest terms the alien adventure ""Earth to Echo"" is a lively and likable knockoff that should divert if not exactly enthrall tweens and young teens.Logic hounds beware however. The script by Henry Gayden from a story by Gayden and producer Andrew Panay has holes big enough to fly well a spaceship through. Still first-time feature director Dave Green keeps things moving so swiftly -- at times too swiftly -- it helps patch over some of the films narrative chasms as well as the fuzziness of its found-footage conceit. In a Nevada suburb three 13-year-old best friends -- the gung-ho Tuck (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) anxious brainy Munch (Reese Hartwig) and soulful foster kid Alex (Teo Halm) -- are preparing to say goodbye as their neighborhood is being leveled for a highway construction project.But the night before all are moving elsewhere with their families the guys start receiving weird disruptive images on their cellphones. Deciphering these missives as maps the trio steals away riding BMX bikes across 20 miles of dark desert highway to find the source of the scrambled communiques. Time and space -- and the boys cycling ability -- are  to say the least ridiculously fudged. Before you can say ""phone home"" the pals discover a friendly alien being a kind of little robotic owl they dub Echo. Turns out Echo has crash-landed and needs to find its missing parts in order to rejoin its mother ship and return to its planet. We know this because Echo beeps once for ""yes"" twice for ""no"" and the boys as well as class hottie Emma (Ella Linnea Wahlestedt) who later joins the guys on their quest to help reassemble Echo are good at asking questions. Earth to Echo trailer Watch the trailer for ""Earth to Echo."" Watch the trailer for ""Earth to Echo."" See more videos But the film sputters as forced obstacles and far-fetched obstructions including those involving a shadowy doctor of sorts (Jason Gray-Stanford) kick in and we lose sight of the alien. The story regains its footing toward the end with a few nice if predictable and derivative payoffs. Though there arent a ton of memorable visual effects in this carefully budgeted effort there is a late-breaking eye-popper involving an airborne truck that should elicit a clap or two. Photos Summer Movie Sneaks 2014 Bradley Hartwig and Halm make engaging leads bringing spirit and commitment to their archetypal roles. Unfortunately the digitally animated Echo has nowhere near the charm warmth or expressiveness of its Spielbergian ancestor. As a result when Halms Alex -- the pieces nominal Elliott -- has his big emotional moment with his otherworldly new friend it plays more like an audition for an ""E.T."" reboot than for the movie hes actually in.------------Earth to EchoMPAA rating PG for action and peril mild languageRunning time 1 hour 29 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Andrew Panay Jason Gray-Stanford Tammy not much fun and talented Melissa McCarthy needs to wise up Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-earth-to-echo-review-20140702-story.html,200,earthtoecho16,earthtoecho,latimes

By Robin Lindsay on Publish Date July 5 2014. Photo by Patrick Wymore/Relativity Media. Watch in Times Video >> embed EARTH TO ECHOOpens on Wednesday.Directed by Dave Green1 hour 31 minutesA chipper shallow knockoff of classic suburban adventure movies ""Earth to Echo"" rolls out a YouTube-and-smartphone update to the little lost alien tales of the 1980s. Technology remains no substitute for well-written characters and genuine intrigue and atmosphere so despite the cute special effects and camera jostling this film feels like an extended episode of an after-school show by Disney (which reportedly developed the project initially). Video Clip Earth to Echo A scene from the film directed by Dave Green. By Relativity Media on Publish Date June 26 2014. Photo by Patrick Wymore/Echo Films. It all starts when a Nevada kid Tuck (Brian Bradley) goes on a final night of rambles with his buddies -- a self-protective smart-mouth named Alex (Teo Halm) and Munch a harmless oddball and Andy Richter ringer played by Reese Hartwig -- before their neighborhood is razed for a superhighway project. When they bike into the desert to investigate weird cellphone interference they eventually come into possession of a blue-eyed owlet-like robot from another world. What were watching was all shot (and narrated) by the compulsively chronicling Tuck though the found-footage device as is so often the case ends up limiting opportunities for visual storytelling. Photo Teo Halm in ""Earth to Echo."" Credit Relativity Media There will always be an appeal to the fantasy of extraterrestrial friendship which lies somewhere between finding a talented imaginary friend who turns out to be real and having a weird high-maintenance pet. This tin critter they name Echo and the usual government goons start nosing in. But despite an endearing detail here and there -- usually to do with Munch -- the childrens overnight adventure is more forgettable than a close encounter of this kind could be.""Earth to Echo"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for kids being kids and befriending an alien.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Munch (Reese Hartwig) encounters Echo a small alien who has become stranded on Earth in ""Earth to Echo."" (Courtesy of Relativity Media) By Sandie Angulo Chen July 1 2014 Any movie about kids and aliens inevitably will draw comparisons to ""E.T."" but ""Earth to Echo"" also includes the friendship adventure of ""The Goonies"" and ""Stand By Me"" combined with the sci-fi thrill of ""Super 8"" and ""Chronicle."" Yes its plainly derivative but Dave Greens debut feature is heartfelt and fun particularly for children craving live-action films beyond big-budget superhero reboots and animated sequels -- all in nearly half the time it takes to watch the latest ""Transformers"" installment. Made for a tech-savvy generation of YouTube subscribers and Skype users ""Earth to Echo"" unspools as shaky footage shot by digital diarist Tuck (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley). Hes eager to show the world what he and his two best friends Alex (Teo Halm) and Munch (Reese Hartwig) discovered during their final 24 hours as neighbors in a Nevada subdivision thats scheduled for demolition. The boys smartphones begin ""barfing up"" weird shapes that eventually map out a piece of desert just miles away. Armed with Tucks Handycam Munchs backpack of essentials and their thirst for excitement the boys ride away on a bicycle mystery tour reminiscent of ""E.T."" but compressed into an ""American Graffiti""-esque night of best-friend exploits. In the desert they swipe a metal capsule that houses a small frightened metallic alien with little more than huge glowing blue eyes. The injured creatures ability to mimic sounds with adorable electronic squeaks leads the boys to name their extraterrestrial find ""Echo."" From there the boys set off on an all-night adventure across Nevada to search for Echos missing parts and spaceship. Its ""phone home"" but with iPhones. Hartwigs Munch the sweet and honest introvert enjoys the funniest lines as the sole rule-follower. ""Shes already had enough guys lying to her"" he laments early on about telling his mom a sleepover cover story. If Munch is the trios conscience Alex the handsome but sensitive orphan is its heart. As a foster-care veteran he understands what its like to be lost and lonely and Halm plays him with a subtle maturity even when the dialogue turns overly sentimental. Astro left Teo Halm and Reese Hartwig star in ""Earth to Echo."" (Patrick Wymore/Relativity Media) The refreshingly brisk films imperfections dont arise so much from its cinematic deja vu -- which is obvious but well meaning -- but from its original elements the unrealistic plot developments (no kid learns to drive without incident in two minutes) underwhelming revelations and uneven characterization. The ""villains"" arent convincingly threatening or dangerous; Echos definitely cute but his back story is too vague to be memorable; and the addition of popular classmate Emma to the group is an unnecessary stab at light romance delivered by a ""pretty but fierce"" stereotype. Emma wouldve been more interesting had she not been ""the hot mannequin girl"" all of the boys fancied. Despite its flaws and recycled parts ""Earth to Echo"" is engaging enough to impress preteen audiences and nostalgic enough to please their parents. Chen is a freelance writer. Earth to Echo   1/2 (89 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some action and peril and mild language. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

(Patrick Wymore) From left Astro (aka Brian Bradley) Ella Wahlestedt Reese Hartwig and Teo Halm (Patrick Wymore) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday July 1 2014 356 PM Title ""Earth to Echo"" Film Info With Teo Halm Reese Hartwig Brian Bradley. Three tween friends have to launch an alien back into space (131). PG Action violence mild language. Area theaters A copy of a copy ""Earth to Echo"" feels less like a weak ""E.T."" than a substandard ""Mac and Me."" And you may not even remember the latter a 1988 bandwagon flop that experienced the same fate likely to hit this well-meaning but underwhelming effort. Director David Green and writer Henry Gayden borrow a more recent but already dated device to frame their first feature found footage. A 13-year-old Tuck (Brian Bradley) carries his camera everywhere and when weird events start occurring hes ready to record them. He and his friends Munch (Reese Hartwig) and Alex (standout Teo Halm) are preparing to separate after a lifetime in the same small neighborhood. A mysterious construction project is forcing their parents to sell their homes but the night before the moving trucks arrive the kids receive an electronic map. With help from their schools popular girl (Ella Wahlestedt) who usually ignores them they go exploring. Eventually they stumble on Echo a robotic alien who needs help returning to his home planet before the government gets hold of him. The owl-like Echo is undeniably adorable but curiously Green barely uses him. Our primary focus is on the kids. Theyre sweetly innocent -- a rare commodity in pop culture -- but mostly unmemorable. The same could be said for their mild exploits. It doesnt help that the filmmakers influences are so obvious and so obviously superior. In addition to ""E.T."" there are echoes of 80s family flicks like ""The Goonies"" and ""Explorers"" and even J.J. Abrams 2011 Spielberg homage ""Super 8."" Green and Gayden have good intentions in wanting to make a low-budget high-impact option for middle-schoolers. Parents could certainly use an alternative to ""Transformers"" and this onell do when its time for an air-conditioned break. The actors are fine and the action distracting enough. But poor production values and an uninspired script ultimately keep Greens tween adventure grounded.

Overall Echo is more of an homage to E.T. than a ripoff despite the unoriginal promo poster and billboards that feature a finger extended to a cute alien with a glowing light where his heart might be.Leading the trio is an engaging kid named Tuck (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) who is constantly documenting the world around him -- probably not unlike E.T. director Steven Spielberg himself at a similar age with earlier film technology. The premise works for a few reasons. Given the existence of so many social media outlets the selfie generation has an easy way with cameras. Plus young Bradley sells it convincingly.Believable as best buddies Teo Halm as Alex and Reese Hartwig as Munch give equally credible naturalistic performances.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare 17-year-old Brian ""Astro"" Bradley is known for rapping on The X Factor but now hes making his feature film debut. He tells Carly Mallenbaum about the challenges of acting opposite an imaginary alien. Misfits at school the teens are about to be separated geographically as their suburban Nevada neighborhood is being emptied to make way for a new highway. No one in the area is happy about being uprooted. For nerdy Munch Teo and Tuck are his first close friendships. Shy Alex an orphan bounced between foster homes has experienced his first taste of home life and stability. And Tuck whose big family sometimes doesnt seem to notice hes there has found two pals to listen to his youthful bravado.When their cellphones begin acting up -- or ""barfing"" as the boys put it -- they immediately suspect a connection with the highway construction project and stumble on a mystery.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Three young friends make an unexpected extraterrestrial discovery while looking for the source of the strange things happening in their neighborhood. VPCOn their final night together the trio work to decipher a cryptic map and ride their bikes deep into the desert documenting it all with an array of cameras. In a remote spot the boys unearth Echo a diminutive alien who resembles an owl with large iridescent blue eyes. Somehow the creature manages to look both futuristic and cuddly. Plus it communicates in sprightly chirps. Alex who knows what it feels like to feel lost and alone particularly relates to the alien critter..The found-footage style of filmmaking is all but played out first becoming popular in the late 1990s with The Blair Witch Project. Since then its been used mostly in horror films most notably in the Paranormal Activity series. Echo director Dave Green employs a similar format for this adventure tale though.Although the story is about the connection the boys make with the ultimate outsider and how they work together to help a creature in need its also about saying goodbye. Nostalgically it brings to mind another classic from the E.T. era 1986sStand By Me.Though most of the film takes place on the boys final night together viewers will get the sense that theyll be bonded together for the rest of their lives.Earth to Echo is about adventure bravery and excitement but mostly its about friendship-- a subject that resonates with audiences of all ages. 21 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1lPod8u",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/01/earth-to-echo-review/10635265/,200,earthtoecho21,earthtoecho,usatoday

Photo Patrick Wymore Walt Disney Pictures Earth to Echo review gimmick leaves hollow ring 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Earth to Echo Fantasy/childrens. Starring Teo Halm Brian Astro Bradley and Reese Hartwig. Directed by Dave Green. (PG. 91 minutes.) ""My heart is beating so fast right now"" a character announces midway through ""Earth to Echo."" Well its nice somebody was excited. But when a movie has to resort to that - bulletins as to how scenes should be going over - its a sure sign that nobody elses pulse is budging. ""Earth to Echo"" represents the worst of the old and the new. It has the bland child characters and the bad acting of an old-fashioned after-school special not to mention a story lifted straight out of ""E.T."" except with the honest emotion replaced by rote sentimentality. At the same time the movie is inflected by modern technology in that its filmed in a new way that makes it original but unwatchable. The gimmick here - and gimmick feels like the right word - is that the movie is shot as if on the central characters cell phones. The idea is that one year after the events depicted on screen the characters got together and edited the footage they shot the year before and the result was ""Earth to Echo."" As you might imagine in order to give a sense of verisimilitude the footage is shifty and unsteady and when it does fix on an image its often of another kid holding a cell phone. More in Movies Hellion Texas filmmaker talks about her rural family drama Deliver Us From Evil review A horrifying number of cliches Tammy review Tears of a clown - not so funny Begin Again review Music drama hits more than misses If parents have any ambitions to get their childrens heads out from their phones this is a movie to avoid. It not only reinforces nonstop connectivity as the norm but it also presents pointing ones phone at everything as some kind of avenue to heroism. Actually the phone is more than that here - its the wellspring of the entire adventure. The kids figure out that something very weird is going on when their smartphones are jammed by some outside force. Three boys - the soulful Alex (Teo Halm) the outgoing Tuck (Brian Astro Bradley) and the chubby endearing Munch (Reese Hartwig) - get on their bicycles one night and ride in the direction of the cellular disturbance. Their journey leads them to a small capsule and to an even smaller little metal guy from outer space who cant speak English but is a whiz at answering yes-and-no questions. Soon they find that they are this little fellows only friends. They want to help him go home while the governments men want to find him and study him. Lets just put it out there Dissection is an option. Those looking for good things in ""Earth to Echo"" might take note of the little aliens design. Big head big blinking eyes very cute. Also there are two special effects moments that are conceptually brilliant and perfectly executed. In one a truck disassembles and recombines. A similar effect on a grander scale shows metal parts swirling around in the sky then fusing together into a spaceship. Its also worth noting just as another sign of the collective mind that this is yet another movie in which the government is not to be trusted. But all these minor virtues cant compensate for a story that starts off and remains a half-hour behind the audience. Everything that happens takes forever so that the modest running time seems much longer. Much of the acting feels pushed and though the movie leans hard on the emotional connection between the kids the connection isnt felt. Also theres no overestimating how tiresome the cell-phone-footage gimmick becomes. Its as if theres a barrier between the viewer and the story that never comes down. Give director Dave Green in his feature debut credit for trying something new and having an idea. Unfortunately not all ideas are good ones. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint If do-it-yourself rawness is your thing ""Earth to Echo"" is your movie. Its stars are a quartet of cute-enough likable-enough child actors who did not emerge from Disneys clone lab Petri dishes. The story is a small-scale (cheap) jumble of ideas filched from ""E.T."" ""Goonies"" ""Super 8"" ""Stand by Me"" ""Men in Black"" and ""Explorers."" First-time director Dave Green presents it as a found-footage adventure a needless stylistic twist that excuses a lot of jitterbug camerawork and inexpensive location shots in the name of spurious realism. Stop me if youve heard this one before. There is a whole lot of echoing going on in the screenplay. Suburban pals (plus a bossy girl) join forces to reunite a marooned space alien with its friends. Menacing scientists want to retrieve ""Echo"" the owl-shaped metallic visitor for purposes of their own triggering chases and kid subterfuge. Bedtimes are ignored bikes are ridden outside of the neighborhood. Parents doing their grown-up thing are oblivious. The youngsters rise to the challenge of disobeying the adult world and emerge mildly bruised but wiser. Hmmmm. Sounds vaguely familiar. The unabashedly unoriginal ingredients have worked before and I suppose if you are 7 years old and seeing them for the first time here they may work again. If you are of an age when putting Jolly Ranchers in your nostrils is no longer high comedy you attend a movie like this out of duty to your kids. Stiff upper lip then. Some days are more about them having a good time than us having a good time. earth to echo  out of 4 stars Rating PG for some action and peril and mild language. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

CAST Brian ""Astro"" Bradley Reese Hartwig Ella Linnea Wahlestedt LENGTH 129 In the family-friendly sci-fi film ""Earth to Echo"" four grade-schoolers discover a space alien stranded in their suburban Nevada neighborhood and decide to help the little guy go home. How does this differ from ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" you ask? Barely at all except on one point These days the kids have iPhones. Thats about the extent of this movies update on Steven Spielbergs 1982 classic. Here as the residents of Mulberry Woods prepare to leave their soon-to-be-razed homes several young friends notice strange goings-on. ""It looks like your iPhone barfed"" says Tuck a wiseacre played by Brian ""Astro"" Bradley but the splattery patterns on their screens turn out to be maps. Tuck his cool pal Alex (Teo Halm) and nerdy sidekick Munch (Reese Hartwig) follow the clues to a lonely spot in the desert where they discover a creature not of this world.

Perhaps creature isnt the right word for Echo who is actually a tiny machine with owlish eyes and a heart that radiates angelic blue light. Unlike E.T. whose ugly mug grew on us as we got to know him Echo is immediately aggressively cutesy-wutesy a Tamagotchi version of R2D2 crossed with a Beanie Baby. As the boys scurry around town -- theyre joined by a token girl Emma (Ella Linnea Wahlestedt) -- Echo gathers random pieces of machinery to feather his massive nest of a spacecraft. Thinly written by Henry Gayden and choppily directed by Dave Green ""Earth to Echo"" is presented as Tucks video diary a conceit that at least allows the bright young cast to create a loose freewheeling camaraderie. Otherwise though the movie tracks ""E.T."" so closely -- right down to the coldhearted government types led by Dr. Madsen (Jason Gray-Stanford) -- that you can almost hear the legal ice cracking beneath the childrens bicycle tires.

"Earth to Echo heartfelt kid adventure has shades of Spielberg review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEarth to Echo heartfelt kid adventure has shades of Spielberg review Kid-focused adventure Earth to Echo has elements of E.T. and others but still manages to be its own movie.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterTues. July 1 2014Earth to EchoStarring Teo Halm Brian ""Astro"" Bradley Reese Hartwig and Ella Wahlestedt. Directed by Dave Green. 91 minutes. Opening July 2 at major theatres. PGOn one eventful summer night a group of kids outsmart interfering adults to help an adorable marooned alien get back home.If the space-fantasy plot of Earth to Echo opening Wednesday July 2 seems to be orbiting a bit too close to planet E.T. it is. And it also packs a lot in from Close Encounters of the Third Kind and maybe just a non-scary touch of Poltergeist along with The Goonies and a smidge of Super 8. For those who see imitation as flattery Earth to Echo is a cinematic Eddie Haskell.Article Continued BelowBut before dismissing this kid-focused adventure as just another Spielberg ripoff heres a twist. Thanks to an engaging young cast of newcomers and a modern update putting cellphones and found footage at the heart of the action Earth to Echo manages to be its own movie one infused with heart and humour. And the kids in the audience who have no idea what phoning home has to do with anything will love it.From left Reese Hartwig Brian ""Astro"" Bradley Teo Halm and Ella Wahlestedt star in Earth to Echo.  (Peter Iovino)  Tuck (The X Factors Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) Munch (Reese Hartwig) and Alex (Teo Halm) are preteen best pals living in a Nevada suburb thats slated for demolition to make room for a new freeway. Theyre heartbroken that their families are being forced to move breaking up their close friendships. And they dont hesitate to show their annoyance with the work crews tearing up their world.Tuck the videographer and brains of the operation seems (and sounds) like a world-weary 25-year-old as he makes a final video of the pals last few days together. Nerdy Munch who explains hes ""an acquired taste"" when it comes to making friends frets about going to a new school. Cool cat Alex comes across as tough but has his own issues to deal with. When their cellphones start to go haywire all showing the same strange patterns -- Tuck describes it as looking like their tech ""barfed"" -- theres a mystery to be solved. Munch who has a bedroom jammed with computer parts figures out the weird images are maps. The kids bluff their parents with talk of sleepovers so they can ride their bikes into the desert to follow the trail and figure out whats going on all chronicled by Tucks cameras.The phone signals lead then to a half-buried capsule containing a tiny owl-like alien with glowing blue eyes who communicates by imitating their ring tones amid a few other nifty noises. Hes been dinged up on his trip to Earth and bonds with Alex who is shy about showing compassion at first but eventually relents.The boys find ways to interact with their new friend who they decide to call Echo and vow to help the little robo-critter reunite with his spaceship for a flight home. Echo helpfully sends maps to their phones.Along the way smarty-pants schoolmate Emma (Ella Wahlestedt) joins the hunt inserted amid the guys for no apparent reason other than to make up the numbers and fulfil a demographic requirement.The four play hide-and-seek from a nosy construction foreman (Jason Gray-Stanford) who seems to know more than hes letting on about strange goings-on in the desert. They keep their parents off their scent in creative ways while Echo takes them on a wild scavenger hunt for spare parts that will help him get back into space.A stop at a house party to look for Tucks older brother nets the keys to his car which will help them move faster. Tuck gamely jumps behind the wheel but has no idea what hes doing. Echo fills in for driving lessons showing he has a few tricks up his robotic sleeve.As for the kids they realize they can actually have a hand in deciding their own fates and gamely go for it.Screen newcomers director Dave Green and writer Henry Gayden who previously teamed on web series Zombie Roadkill are aiming for a Goonies vibe with the film and occasionally manage to come close.As for kids in the audience the jiggling camera work may be unsettling -- that goes for parents as well -- and they may find it upsetting when Echo is in peril. With so few kid-friendly movies on the summer slate Earth to Echo offers a heartfelt and often comic adventure.

"Earth to Echo is nice but no E.T. - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeEarth to Echo is nice but no E.T.By Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 06/30/2014 030000 PM PDTUpdated 07/01/2014 014957 PM PDT One should view ""Earth to Echo"" with a couple of qualifications.The first is yes of course its like Steven Spielbergs ""E.T."" in that a group of kids bond with a cute alien and fighting shady government types go on a bicycle-rattling quest to shuttle their new little friend home. To resist the obvious is futile thus ""Earth to Echo"" pays its rightful tribute and moves on.The second qualification is that this movie obviously tries appealing to our emotional memories of that ""last summer"" so many of us had as kids before someone moved away before we started middle school high school or whatever. That and not space aliens is what people will be ruminating on as they leave the theater.The space alien stuff is pretty fun too as long as one can suspend enough disbelief. That will be easy enough for kids; the rest of us may wish it were still that easy.Tuck (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) Munch (Reese C. Hartwig) and Alex (Teo Halm) are inseparable friends facing big changes. Their Nevada neighborhood is being ripped up for a highway project and everybody has to move -- some farther away than others. But just a couple of days before theyre supposed to leave the boys start getting strange transmissions on their cell phones.Of course this is their last chance to do something memorable before they split up and -- fueled by their suspicions of what might ""really"" be happening in their neighborhood -- they go on an adventure portrayed through lots of on-the-ground cinematography that makes it feel like youre bumping along on someones handlebars. It can get a bit old.Advertisement Along with their friend Emma (Ella Linnea Wahlestedt -- who provides the seemingly mandated preteen gender tension) -- our heroes seek to solve a mystery with just enough of that ""Goonies""-like innocent determination to make us root for them.Once they find their tiny stranded alien the mystery shifts into more of a thrill ride as the kids have to figure out how to get their owlish friend back to where it belongs while theyre being tracked through various late night haunts like an all-night diner biker bar and house party. But where ""Earth to Echo"" falls short of a film like ""E.T."" or even ""The Goonies"" is in developing its characters. The kids are nice enough -- played by actors who do whats asked of them -- but director Dave Green and writer Henry Gayden dont give us reasons to really care about them (Munch is no Chunk from ""The Goonies""). The moviemakers tell us theres a bond between these characters but they dont really show us. Nor do Green and Gayden give us many moments that well remember. The ending here is satisfying but there is nothing to make you cry along with the unforgettable face of a broken-up Drew Barrymore. (L-R) Echo and Resse Hartwig as Munch in Earth to Echo. (Relativity Media) (Courtesy of Relativity Media) ""Earth to Echo"" will likely get flattened by bigger summer offerings. But its decent enough to serve as a warm uncomplicated and under-the-radar alternative thats good for the whole family.

Photo Relativity Media MOVIE REVIEW Earth to Echo Running time 82 minutes. Rated PG (mild action and peril profanity). At the E-Walk Kips Bay others. ""Earth to Echo"" is such a shameless ""E.T."" rip-off that I picture excited dictionary editors rushing to their publishing plants screaming ""Stop the presses All previous examples weve given of rip-off and shameless have just become obsolete"" Three adolescent boys (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley Teo Halm and Reese Hartwig) living in a suburb thats about to be razed to make room for a superhighway trace weird signals from their cellphones to a power-line tower in the desert. There they discover a coffee-can sized metal alien with adorable blue eyes. The thing looks like a cross between a kitten and a cockroach. Calling the lil fella Echo the boys (and a random young lady they pick up along the way because the screenwriter remembered halfway through that youre supposed to sell tickets to girls) establish that the critter who blinks once for yes and twice for no wants to get onboard his spaceship and go home. Teo Halm hangs with the alien critter ""Echo.""Photo Relativity Media So did I. The big (by which I mean small) innovation here is that this time everythings juiced up with smartphones tiny camcorders and other gizmos (E.T. phone Cupertino) and the film is meant to look like an assemblage of amateur documentary footage (hold the line Mr. Terrestrial Ive got Blair Witch on Line Two). To kid audiences or so goes the hope all of this will come across as raw YouTube-y reality but the found-footage fad is so tired -- a child conceived at a Blair Witch drive-in screening would be older than these characters -- that these days the technique is just an extra annoying level of artifice atop all the other fakery that goes into a movie. Astro Teo Halm and Reese Hartwig in ""Earth to Echo.""Photo Relativity Media The characters are thin the plot predictable Bad guys in orange construction vests want to capture the alien and test it to death while the good kids just want to sneak off with Echo and watch him zoom away to a better galaxy. (Also the chief villain looks like the son of the lead tool from ""Ghostbusters"" William Atherton). Theres so little to hold your attention (except for a couple of cool scenes when Echo uses his telekinetic powers to rearrange all the metal around him Magneto-style) that all you notice is the surface the overcaffeinated cutting the strenuously poor framing the playing with the zoom lens and the labored attempts to be scary by making the images disintegrate into digital pixels. Even at a cramped and frenetic 82 minutes the movie feels long. Thats what happens when the audience can guess everything thats going to happen in advance. Even the 12-year-olds the movie is aimed at werent born yesterday.

Aimed presumably at young audiences who have never been exposed to a 32-year-old Steven Spielberg movie about a homesick extraterrestrial Dave Greens Earth to Echo flaunts its obvious influences with all the fresh novelty of an app update. While the method of storytelling has been given a fitting technological upgrade everything regarding this sci-fi adventure right down to the movie poster is blatant regarding its intentions It clearly sees itself as E.T. for the Y2K set. STORY Earth to Echo to Have World Premiere at Los Angeles Film Festival Still give novice feature director Green and screenwriter Henry Gayden credit for more than just audacity -- despite all those echoes of classic 80s sci-fi fantasy adventures Earth to Echo proves engaging in its own right. Credit a youthful energetic spirit nicely conveyed by its cast of naturally acting newcomers a workable raw-footage construct and a spare but smartly spent special effects budget for the satisfying end result. Getting a jump on the Fourth of July holiday weekend the well-positioned Relativity Media release (which was acquired from Disney) could generate some noticeable sparks by claiming the family-friendly PG slot all to itself. The 89-minute film cuts quickly to the chase as the lives of teenage longtime best buddies Tuck (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley) Munch (Reese Hartwig) and Alex (Teo Halm) are about to be uprooted with a new highway development scheduled to level their suburban Nevada neighborhood. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies X-Men Days of Future Past Mockingjay But as they spend one final night together before the mass exodus their cell phones start ""barfing"" up what appears to be maps and other gibberish and the trio suspects something else could be responsible for attracting all those shifty-looking construction folks. Their attempts at deciphering the images take them to the middle of the desert where a strange-looking cylinder embedded in the ground next to a transformer soon yields a frightened wide-eyed inhabitant -- no Reeses Pieces required. Even the previously uninitiated will know where all this is headed. Aside from the primary source of inspiration youll also find bits of everything from The Goonies to Super 8 woven not-so-subtly into the Earth to Echo tapestry. But having the characters constant reliance on video recording texting and various forms of social-media-driven communication keeps it all in and of the moment and thats also true of the contemporary dialogued delivered by its likable young cast. As for the homesick little alien theyve come to name Echo -- cmon who can resist something that looks like a metallic owl bobblehead with glowing neon-blue eyes and speaks in cute electronic chirps? Sometimes even the most shameless of knockoffs cant be denied.

Boasting the dubious distinction of being the first found-footage adventure made for family audiences ""Earth to Echo"" reaches for the stars with its gentle sci-fi shenanigans but the rote result remains decidedly earthbound. Tyro helmer Dave Green wears his 80s-era Amblin inspirations on his sleeve in this good-hearted ""E.T.""-meets-""Chronicle"" hybrid which never quite finds its own voice. A little picture bravely expected to enter the summer wide-release skirmish a few days after the latest ""Transformers"" installment ""Echo"" looks likely to get steamrolled at the box office by more substantial studio product. Developed and produced by Disney under a cloud of secrecy as the ""Untitled Wolf Adventure"" back in summer 2012 the relatively low-budget pic was quietly sold to Relativity last year when the Mouse House reportedly didnt know what to do with it. Those concerns appear to have been well founded based on the finished products likable but low-wattage cast and disappointingly one-dimensional approach to story and character. Although the film was directed by Green and written by Henry Gayden the found-footage conceit positions what were watching as the work of budding filmmaker Tuck (Brian ""Astro"" Bradley of ""The X Factor"") who utilizes multiple cameras (including one hidden in a pair of glasses) to record every minute with his two best buddies foster kid Alex (Teo Halm) and ""acquired taste"" Munch (Reese Hartwig). The three teens face their last days together in a suburban Nevada development scheduled to be demolished by a highway expansion project but theyre distracted from the pending separation by an intriguing techno-mystery. Inexplicably scrambled cell-phone displays (""It looks like your phone barfed on the screen"" cracks Tuck) are the first clue something is amiss and the shy yet savvy Munch determines that the source of the problem lies somewhere in the desert. After formulating a plan to keep their parents in the dark the trio sneak out at night and make their grand discovery. A pint-sized robotic alien has crash-landed in their neighborhood and cant set off for home until its collected all its missing parts. It can however communicate through beeps (once for yes twice for no) and guide the boys on their quest to help. The search leads to a series of less-than-thrilling setpieces including pitstops at a local bar and an underage house party attended by Tucks sneering older brother. Nervous parents shouldnt worry; thats about as risque as the squeaky-clean pic gets. For better and for worse theres nothing to match the crass comedy of the films spiritual cousin ""The Goonies"" or the darker developments of something like ""Gremlins."" Ultimately ""Echo"" is even less edgy than ""E.T."" though it remains firmly indebted to the Steven Spielberg classic above all other influences. To that end while motormouthed Tuck initially appears to be the lead the focus gradually shifts to the more Elliott-like Alex. Hes the one who bonds most strongly with the stranded extraterrestrial dubbed Echo by the boys (after Tucks suggestions of Master Blaster and Space Ninja are rejected) and becomes its most protective caretaker. One doesnt need to go too far back to find a superior Spielberg homage J.J. Abrams ""Super 8"" was released the summer before ""Earth to Echo"" commenced production and even that films ardent detractors would have to admit its far more engaging and full-bodied than what Green and Gayden can muster here. While the three young leads are appealing and natural with precious few traces of cloying kid thesping their roles remain underdeveloped and one-note throughout. That makes any attempts at emotional resonance through the tropes of boyhood friendships or Alexs lost-boy connection with Echo perfunctory at best. Even worse is the awkward effort to shoehorn in a female presence in the form of rebellious popular girl Emma (Ella Linnea Wahlestedt). Shes treated purely as window dressing following a dramatic introduction arguing with her traditionalist parents. At one point Tuck even excises an entire romantic-leaning scene featuring Emma because shes ""annoying"" -- its the only time he manipulates the footage to that degree. Adults similarly dont factor into the mix in any significant way. Jason Gray-Stanford earns the most screen time for a grown-up as a shady construction worker who knows more about Echos link to the neighborhood than he lets on. Though hes theoretically a villain the stubbornly low stakes prevent the character from ever becoming much of a threat. That leaves the undeniably adorable Echo -- looking like a cross between Wall-E and the robotic owl Bubo from 1981s ""Clash of the Titans"" -- to emerge as the films most dynamic presence in just a handful of scenes. Designed by 19-year-old Ross Tran and brought to life by an assortment of vfx houses the only explanation for why we dont see more of the endearing aliens antics onscreen must be budgetary. Presumably thats also the primary reason for d.p. Maxime Alexandres occasionally nauseating handheld camerawork which -- in what has become a hallmark of the found-footage genre -- often obscures the action better than it captures it. (The easier to disguise what were not actually seeing.) Theres one unimpeded and impressively executed money shot when Echo disassembles and reassembles an oncoming semi-trailer truck to avoid a head-on collision. Otherwise the most winning visual wrinkle is a few glimpses from Echos p.o.v. though how Tuck received that footage to include in his movie is not exactly clear. He sure found a dynamite sound team as Echos beeps and whirls and the more standard action-based contributions of the audio department rep the standout in a generally OK tech package. A post-credits tag suggests the story isnt over yet but given Echos already protracted journey to the screen anyone expecting a speedy return could be in for quite a long wait.

Kait says June 25 2014 at 1201 pm I attended a early screening of the movie yesterday and found many things inappropriate for younger children. It sends messages to kids that its ok to lie to your parents stay out all night steal cars and go for ""joy rides"" going into bars riding there bikes alone at night all over town and going to high school parties where theres drinking going on. There were many things the young people in this Movie did that to children younger than 13 or 14 could send a message that its ok to do these things. I wouldnt take my 6 year old twin boys to see this movie. Reply Amanda says June 8 2014 at 408 am I havent seen it yet but when I do it will be because were fans of Ella (Emma). Great actress and was hoping ECHO would showcase her talents in the film. Reply LOL says June 6 2014 at 1251 pm Yeah I just read the 1984 Variety review for The Goonies where they called it ""underpowered"". Variety doesnt like kids. (Or understand them.)
