Comments (5) click to enlarge Jurassic World Video Rated PG-13  124 minutes  2015 A fossilized skeleton pried from the earth in southern California and dating as far back in history as 1993 reveals this new blockbuster to be not a sequel but a remake. Notice the similar spinal formation two kids venture into the title theme park to experience the wonder of cloned dinosaurs but all hell breaks loose. Chris Pratt whose action-hero insouciance harks back to Errol Flynn stars as a dino trainer at the park who goes in to rescue the kids and tangles with an especially wicked mutant dinosaur; Bryce Dallas Howard plays the kids aunt a park administrator who must be ritually taught that man shouldnt meddle in things he doesnt understand.

"Jurassic World - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Jurassic World Posted by Christy Lemire on June 16 2015 68 Comments Universal Pictures Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of science-fiction violence and peril. Running time 123 minutes. Two stars out of four. Its silly of me right? I have this notion that a big splashy blockbuster should provide characters and story lines that matter that engage us so that there are actual stakes and not just a lot of noisy stomping. Theoretically we should care whether or not someone is going to get eaten by a genetically engineered 50-foot-tall dinosaur. We shouldnt be distracted by flimsy subplots or the unlikely (and ungainly) sight of a grown woman running for her life through the jungle in high heels. And yet this is what ""Jurassic World"" gives us in between some admittedly spectacular visuals. I know what youre thinking ""Its not meant to be an Oscar winner."" ""Its a popcorn movie."" ""Why cant you just shut off your brain and have a good time?"" Also ""You suck."" All of the above are probably true. And yet I had a hard time connecting with ""Jurassic World"" and its cardboard characters making poor choices over and over again. It simultaneously tries to cram in too much without giving us enough in the way of substance. I was a big fan of director and co-writer Colin Trevorrows first feature 2012s ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" an indie sci-fi dramedy in which the time travel element actually worked. (It also made Mark Duplass surprisingly sexy for the first time.) Trevorrow is doing his best Spielberg impression here and he creates a couple of thrilling set pieces -- his pterodactyl attack for example is at once exciting and horrifying and a lovely little Hitchcock homage. But Im not sure he was ready for a behemoth of a film like this just yet. Lets get to the plot real quickly and a few thoughts then call it a day. ""Jurassic World"" made nearly 209 million in its first weekend for the biggest domestic opening of all time. Clearly you saw it and you know what happens. Nevertheless let us trudge on. A bunch of people who didnt learn from the travesties that occurred during the original ""Jurassic Park"" from 1993 and its two sequels have developed yet another family-friendly dino playland on an island off the coast of Costa Rica under the guidance (and considerable financial support) of billionaire Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan). Among his chief employees is velociraptor wrangler Owen (Chris Pratt) who is ruggedly confident and wears leather vests with zero irony. The one truly astonishing element of ""Jurassic World"" is that it manages to make Pratt boring. Hes the hottest and most charismatic star on the planet right now and hes on a huge roll following last years ""The Lego Movie"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Here he certainly rises to the physical challenges but hes strangely understated stuck as he is in a one-note role. It is an enormous bummer. Pratt is also stuck in a half-baked romantic subplot with Bryce Dallas Howard who co-stars as Claire an all-business operations executive. (Her sleek bob says it all.) They had one date and now he keeps trying to flirt with her. The banter in the script -- from Trevorrow ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" writer Derek Connolly and the husband-and-wife team of Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver -- isnt exactly the snappiest. And -- spoiler -- when Owen and Claire finally do kiss after a sequence of great panic it feels forced and hollow. But Claire has been too busy for him or for anything outside of work. Like a cliched rom-com heroine shes married to her job (for which her sister played by Judy Greer shames her). Claire is also busy on this particular day tending to her visiting nephews sullen teenager Zach (Nick Robinson) and his perky moppet of a younger brother Gray (Ty Simpkins). A subplot about the kids parents divorcing is brought up and then dropped -- as if placing them in massive peril repeatedly ostensibly werent enough to garner our sympathy. Then theres another whole subplot featuring Vincent DOnofrio as a private military contractor who wants to take Owens well-trained velociraptors and turn them into a lucrative fighting force. As if the humans-are-so-arrogant theme running through the whole series werent completely obvious yet this really hammers it home and it turns the formidable versatile DOnofrio into a swaggering Texas stereotype. These people and thousands of others find themselves under attack when the parks latest attraction a five-story-high dino hybrid known as the Indominus Rex escapes after being raised in isolation for years. (This is incredibly violent for a PG-13 movie by the way -- something to think about if youre pondering bringing young kids.) But the park gets a spike in attendance every time something new is developed and under the watch of mad scientist Henry Wu (BD Wong) this is the biggest creature yet. Its got more teeth a brilliant mind and the ability to camouflage itself -- all to ""up the wow factor"" as Claire puts it with catastrophic consequences. So basically ""Jurassic World"" is a big-budget indictment of corporate greed jammed with product placement for Samsung and Mercedes-Benz and Beats by Dre and Coca-Cola. But given the record-shattering opening the movie had Id say everyone involved had their cake ate it too and went back for seconds.

And be kinder to yourself Monster Movie Lover. You are NOT a Moron. Reply June 20 2015  by  Dan     Its dinosaurs that go crazy ... again. Thank you for the completely unnecessary critique. And oh yeah ""you suck"". Reply June 22 2015  by  joearde     thanks Reply June 23 2015  by  Rene martinez     Did not care for the movie fell asleep for 10 min . somewhere in the movie and went to get popcorn somewhere in the movie Reply June 16 2015  by  Gerardo Valero     I can accept that the only way for a movie like this to work is to have one of the dinosaurs escape and cause havoc but whats the point of putting children in peril when everybody knows theres no way either of them will get hurt? I also agree that the pterodactyl attack scene is pretty exciting but having Pratt/Howard kiss passionately with her nephews watching while tourists are getting devoured was just ridiculous specially since they have no chemistry whatsoever. Sure the movie broke all kinds of opening weekend records but I have a hard time imagining anybody going back for seconds. Reply June 16 2015  by  Vincent     I agree with you completely on this. Two things that could have completely save this movie are cut the subplots or tie them into the one main subplot and let Chris Pratt be Chris Pratt the charming goof we all love. I think the subplots just distracted from what could have been a good summer popcorn movie like pacific rim. Fun action that knows what we are there for and for the most part sticks to it. Also I do think Chris Pratt can play a serious dramatic role but in a movie like this where it is very self-serious most of the time and doesnt give his character much to do let Chris Pratt make jokes and release some of the forced tension. Let him charm us into forgiving the many flaws of this movie because he can. Hes Chris Pratt let him BE Chris Pratt. Reply June 16 2015  by  Kevin     Glad Im not the only reviewer out there that thought this movie was mostly a waste of time. Heres mine if you are interested in reading it. http//number9moviereviews.blogspot.com/2015/06/jurassic-world-rawr-and-stuff.html Reply June 17 2015  by  avery     1st I think alot of people are being highly judgemental of this movie when they might not know the most about doinosaurs. And 2nd Most of the ""rediculous things"" that happen in this movie play off of other Bs name something that happens in the movie and theres a reasonable explanation for why it happens. Keep in mind that trex had terrible eyesite and wouldve chased a flare before following Claire. Claire throws the flare at irex and Trex heads to fight because rexes are also very territorial and fought almost anything that came into its range. Also the whole idea of dinos coming back from exstiction by extracting blood from mosquitos (the original film) is pretty out there so i dont see how anything can be that unrealistic in anybodies review regarding the new dino flick. Just saying they did what they could with not that good an idea Reply June 18 2015  by  Vincent     Its not a matter of being realistic. Its a matter of how effective the absurdity is at engaging the audience into the movie and helping us escape our everyday lives. Now that I have some perceptive on this movie I think the biggest issue is that I was constantly aware of time passing because I just wasnt that engaged in anything This movie could have been dumber and even more ludicrous and that would have been fine if it was fun and helped me escape the everyday ordinariness that is time. It just didnt though. Plain boring and ultimately it is just a forgettable movie if Im honest Reply June 27 2015  by  Tommy S     Wow...Not one of these points was what was criticized in the review. Please try again. Reply June 16 2015  by  Andrew Cox     I havent seen the movie because each trailer and clip I saw looked progressively dumber. This sounds exactly like what I expected. The clip I saw of Howard and Pratt at his characters house was so flat that it deflated any interest I had in seeing it. Its so disappointing that the biggest movies cant be the best. Reply June 16 2015  by  Jessica     I cant agree more. I love the action and the graphics and the plot line but I think everyone would have been EVEN MORE emotionally involved and even more on the edge of their seats if they had more character development. Reply June 20 2015  by  J     So you wish the movie was 3 hrs long huh hah then you would complain about the length of the movie Reply June 16 2015  by  Jonross85     I loved the move. You have to remember the stars are the dinosaurs. Unlike Godzilla this movie showed the monster and didnt just hide it all the time. I came in knowing that the gene spliced T Rex was smarter than the average bear but the skills he had kept me wanting to know more. The raptor training discouraged me at first in the previews but to see how it was done in the movie made it make sense. In the last two movies you would think they would learn this just tells you how greedy humanity is. History repeats itself all the time. Reply June 16 2015  by  John     gt;Lets get to the plot real quickly and a few thoughts then call it a day.lt; Brilliant. With that witty comment you won me over since it encapsulates almost every Hollywood blockbuster made these days. I pity the movie reviewer today who is tasked with analyzing these kiddy flicks. Movies made by men in grey flannel suits not by creative artists thats darn sure. Reply June 20 2015  by  J     Art is no different Reply June 16 2015  by  DW     I hated this movie for being so lazy. nothing was interesting. i have no idea why donofrios character was in it. they took chris pratt and made him boring. waste of time. Reply June 17 2015  by  Ezekiel thirtyate     The first jurrasic park was hands down DOPE Especially in the sound editing not to mention mechanics and CGI... The corny dialouge in the first one actually MADE the movie better.... However jurassic world was a predicable and horrible attempt to try and generate a newer generation of jurassic fans.... The writers gave it a fair shot of making fun of themselves with the ""twisty"" dialogue but the actors made it the most unbelievable shit i have seen since the last spider man movie.... No. T rex does not get to pull a terminator and become the good guy. Hes a fucking t rex. Two kids trapped with two un certain lovers (with cheesy sexual tension) trying to save them scientists being greedy military jargon (thats aaaaalllll wrong mind you) for the sake of an island that is supposed to be millineums old as a theme park?????? No.... Dude you did that already.... If u wanted to do that shouldve just done a remake. GAWBAAGE 100% nothing new. Reply June 20 2015  by  Gabe Denton     Fuck all you old people being greedy with your old movies saying they are better. But in reality they arent better. They are old piece of shit classics. I mean some of them are good. But when it comes to our new generation movies they are way better. Reply July 14 2016  by  beestingza     Ok there pipsqueak please do explain how are your movies better exactly? Just because something is old doesnt make it better and just because something is new doesnt make it better (especially on some notion that new belongs to the young- what a ridiculous concept) If you are trying to make an argument that lends any credibility to yourself as knowing your ass from your elbow you are failing miserably. The so-called classics become classics by having something that stands the test of time. Name one thing in this sequel that does that. Its reheated popcorn which everybody knows seriously sucks (Even the original largely traded on the then-new CGI so Im not one to even state its a classic). Reply June 17 2015  by  Jared     Yes Thank you The sheer number of people who gave this movie positive reviews is a testament to the direction this country is heading. Ignorance is bliss. The characters were static stereotypical and completely predictable. The only one who made any sense at all was quickly killed off in an helicopter crash. It was completely absurd that a dinosaur following the heat signatures of the majority of people would continuously target the same 4 or 5 when there were hundreds if not thousands grouped together Every time the main characters made a mistake that should have cost them their lives namely stopping to watch while the dinosaurs were tearing people apart they were rewarded with survival instead. Every good fictional movie depends on its viewers ability to suspend logic and believe that what the6vre watching could really happen. This movie simply pushes that envelope too far I was hoping for a back story as to how and why the park was reopened and perhaps have a couple of the main characters return to express their concerns but that would have been too much to ask for and the way their roles would have been written would likely only lead to greater disappointment. Reply June 17 2015  by  AlsoFilm     Scene panicked characters running through a dino exhibit to escape a raptor one of them hits a button on a console as he passes that brings to life a hologram of a dinosaur momentarily confusing the raptor and allowing the characters to escape. Scene as shot by Trevorrow characters run camera follows in essentially wide shot one of them hits the button (maybe the youngest of them?) hologram comes up raptor thrown off his game. Scene as would have been shot by Spielberg camera tracks characters running and then tracks the younger brother and his hand has he reaches for and presses the button....characters keep running but camera holds on the button identifying the dinosaur to be conjured before spinning around (with music have peaked a crescendo) to show the hologram and the puzzled raptor who thrashes a couple of times determines its a mirage and then continues its pursuit camera now tracking it as characters have made their way outside. Sure the same thing happens in both versions but Spielberg gives the audience a chance to practically participate in momentary stroke of genius and to understand who actually pushed the button. Trevorrow just wants to get to the next scene. Reply July 14 2016  by  beestingza     Im so happy someone noticed that scene and how much it sucked. I had to go back and rewind that part to find out who hit the button it was so fast and meaningless. I suppose I surmised that the little brainiac kid was the one who hit it but it didnt give the audience time to participate in his thought process at all just as you say. Similarly when they fixed the 20-year idle jeep it felt forced and completely unbelievable and didnt offer us any satisfaction in the problem-solving (taking the battery out of the wrecked cart was too convenient. Why couldnt they have fished it out of the wrecked hamster-ball? That would have offered a better view to the flexibility and creativity and have been less obvious. The film is chock full of empty gestures just like the one you identified and is why this film will be forgotten as soon as the novelty of another dino-flick wears off for the kids who saw it. CGI has become so good and so pervasive that directors dont seem to know how to make good stand-alone movies anymore. I imagine a great movie would still be good even if the special effects seriously sucked. Reply June 17 2015  by  Aaron     I think you missed some plot points. Hoskins had a deal with Wu to bread the Indominus as an undetectable murdering war machine. Hoskins and Wu were the obvious villains here. Remember when Simon was on to Wu and asked questions about why the iRex could mask his temperature and camouflage? Then later Hoskins fessed up to the idea of breading smaller ones for war use. Also the iRex wasnt 50ft lol. I believe it was Claire that said it would reach 50 feet when shes fully grown.It was around Tyrannosaurus sized which puts its at around 18 feet tall and 30 feet long. You can tell by looking at it... especially during the Last fight. The Mosasaur isnt even 50 feet. Reply June 17 2015  by  Carlos     Picky picky picky. Reply June 17 2015  by  Carlos     Oh shut up I did not go to see the movie to extract some hidden meaning some poetic irony or to learn a life lesson I went to see an action thriller and it certainly lived up to that. As Monster Movie Lover said go see some boring tearjerker. I do sometimes but when it is summer I want to be entertained and this movie did that. all you others who nit pick are missing the point. Sur the kiss was not necessary but it only lasted a few seconds. And yes the holographic raptor scene was not believable but again only a few seconds. I am an intelligent well read person who loves Madam Bovary etc.. but I am also a human being who seeks escapism from time to time And Jared a sheer testament to where this country is headed? We dont all live in Finland hahaha. Just wait until November and placate your need for some sappy difficult to follow and boring move - you know like Bordman Reply June 20 2015  by  jd     Wow that was intelligent. Reply June 23 2015  by  Danny     You didnt have to read the review. The movie was terrible. Coming to someones review page and telling them to shut up because you disagree with their opinion says more about you than them. As does your choice in film fare. Reply July 22 2015  by  JozieLee     Here here Carlos. I couldnt agree with you more. Reply June 17 2015  by  Cory Farris     This coming from the same person who gave ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" a POSITIVE review forever disqualifying herself as having an IQ. Reply June 20 2015  by  a     This. God save us of action movies with less ""inteligent"" plot but bad sex movie with bad characters we cant touch that. Ya the review is flawed. But for who gave a positive review as u said to that piece of junk this is expected. Reply June 18 2015  by  Geddy     This movie is what summer blockbuster season is all about ever since the late 70s at least. Big budgets sequels in need of scientific notation in the title eye candy special effects dismissing pesky science amp; plot holes to drive your Winnebago through. Go lock yourselves in a room with IFC if these movies arent your cup of meat. For myself I love all kinds of movies. Independent films are some of my favorites most Oscars noms I enjoy even the odd gore-fest from time to time. With movie prices these days I have a pretty good idea what Im getting myself into prior to shelling out cash. In this case I was happy to fork over the extra clams to see ""Jurassic World"" in 3D and it did not disappoint me Several times I reflexively recoiled to keep those raptors out of my Skittles. Yet despite a willingness to suspend my disbelief I did have one ""ugh"" moment I must confess the cheesy kiss scene who does that in the middle of fleeing for their lives? However I was quickly scooped back up by the action and like our fearless reviewer here I did think it ever so slightly reminiscent of Hitchcocks ""The Birds"" during part of the Pterodactyl attack. A nice touch. I guess I couldnt help but wonder a couple times why these 180+ I.Q.s keep making these eating machines then supplying lots of apparently delicious squishy humans for them to snack on. In the end it wasnt that big of a stretch for me simple greed outweighs common sense almost every time we see it all around us. In the end as far as summer blockbusters are concerned and for a evening out with my 12 yr old niece this was a good movie. Fit the bill almost to perfection. Reply June 18 2015  by  Jack     I completely agree with you on this Christy. Jurassic World completely failed to engage (and Im not a difficult target). 15 minutes in I wondered how long the movie would go on. Eternity it seemed. Lame and un-engaging characters most everyone except Pratt and the Indian CEO guy. The dinos were good but never great (except the pterodactyls and whatever lived in the pond). The controller guy and his sidekick girl in the control room were OK. Most everyone else was completely unwatchable including the two mostly annoying kids and their annoying aunt and parents. The plot was razor thin even for an action blockbuster. Dialog and character development bordered on silly. The original Jurasic Park rocked. This episode should be stoned. Reply June 18 2015  by  Paul Birnbaum     A few days ago in a thread complaining about the people complaining about Bryce Dallas Howards shoes I had written ""it seemed to me like I was shrugging thats stupid about every 10 or 15 minutes..."" just to try and be brief But then and still before reading the above review (with which you will see I whole-heartedly agree) I wrote an elaboration of the point (mostly in response to a comment that seemed to imply that the ""one moment"" that spoiled the movie for the commenter was the shoes)  ""It wasnt just that flaw in the writing (as if it was only one flaw). Too many of the characters displayed levels of hubris and lack of deference to that previous incident...(now you got me going) ""The control room tech who wore a Jurassic Park t-shirt (scored off eBay for 150). Had ANY merchandise been produced in bulk for the original park? Would it not all have been destroyed after what happened EVEN BEFORE THAT PARK OPENED? Would a remaining t-shirt (possibly from that little bit of merchandise shown in the Visitors Center...that same building which is shown to have been left neglected and overgrown where remnants of the old When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth banner are shown still lying on the floor in tatters) go for as LITTLE as 150 if it had been obtained and kept in wearable condition for all that time and then sold as a collectible? ""And not checking with Control for the location of the tracker BEFORE having unarmed ""handlers"" (including the Raptor Whisperer) go into the I-Rex paddock?

Im as willing as the next SF fan to turn off my brain ramp up the suspension-of-disbelief and just enjoy the ride. But if you look at any of the details too much of Jurassic Worlds writing makes so little sense. ""And people are complaining about what? Bryce Dallas Howards SHOES? Give me a break.

Why? Because of the gratuitous snarky comment about the female character wearing high heels in the jungle. Well that and the sexist comment about how Pratt is ""the hottest and most charismatic star on the planet right now."" If it were a MALE reviewer ridiculing the female characters footwear the women would be after the guy with pitchforks and torches which if nothing else illustrates the blatant double-standards in todays society where the sexes are concerned. I never expect much of sequels -- Jurassic Park 2 and 3 were predictably putrid attempts to cash in on the amazing original. But Im going to see it tonight anyhow. Why? Because Spielberg is involved with it and because Im curious to see how they developed the original idea using the producer who originally came up with the idea.

However I go to movies and judge evaluate them primarily on; did it entertain me and did it make me forget about my real life issues? In this movie I found that to be YES San Andreas on the other hand I felt bored...the acting the dialogue and situations just made me too aware of the movie making process rather than feeling engaged in the movie. Jurassic World the time went by quickly. Reply June 19 2015  by  Normandywells     Just goes to show women shouldnt review action films. Just kidding Seriously though Jurassic World is pretty stunning. Exciting heart stopping action REAL character development (Bryce Dallas is really good and has a very clear character arc the author missed somehow-maybe too focused on her shoes??). The Pteranodon attack is amazing as is the finale-wow Chris Pratt is good as expected. Definitely a twice see Reply June 19 2015  by  Greg     Since you dont like characters ""making poor choices over and over again"" Id suggest not watching any Jurassic Park series movies.

Never would spend money to see it in the cinema. Reply June 20 2015  by  Aaron     Now I may just be some normal person with no title to my name and no credentials or the like but I will tell you right now that Jurassic World is one of the best movies that I have seen in a LONG time. The whole point to the story of it is human greed and wanting more of everything. Wanting more money wanting to be scared more wanting to be thrilled and awed more. On that note the movie is perfect. Yes it has its flaws but so does every other movie ever made. I love how they wrote it so that the park has already been open and has been functioning for this long. Now they did learn from the previous movies on that note until park satisfaction began to fall. So they needed a new way of bringing revenue in. In steps Indominus Rex. A genetically modified hybrid. Bred in captivity with no syblings no socialization and knowing only one thing. When the crane lowers I get fed. That means like Chris Pratt stated in the movie ""animals bred in captivity with no socialization generally dont function well."" And thats the truth. I Rex is a highly intelligent and sophisticated dino. Its not really the humans fault that she escaped she just outsmarted them and made them think she escaped. And hence the rest of the story begins. Now for everyone saying that this movie is a complete bust its boring it has no taste or whatever you want to say Ill just say this I went during opening weekend to a packed theater and after the movie was over all I could hear was how great and effing awesome it was. So you obviously dont know jack about what the people like and dont like. This movie is awesome and everyone I know and talked to about it have said that they love it. Reply June 20 2015  by  Bob     Agree completely with your review (except for Pratt he couldnt pump life into that crap script). My wife dragged me to this in 3D no less and I kept looking at my watch and hoping they would get to some point already. Reply June 20 2015  by  Sarah     Its totally ridiculous that a woman in peril would keep her heels on. If youve never worn heels I guess you wouldnt understand. Its 2015 is it too much to ask to omit boring gender stereotypes that perpetuate discrimination? I wanted to barf. At least Laura Dern in Jurassic Park was interesting and believable. Reply June 21 2015  by  Andy     Great review - mirrors my views exactly. The high heels annoyed me so much. Shes running through jungles and rivers in the dark and theyre still on. Really?

Reply June 21 2015  by  Bill     Spot on review. After the original classic this was a hot mess that tried playing to every chiche. Reply June 21 2015  by  Jack     Im a huge fan of the Jurassic Park franchise and quite frankly the fourth installment was one of its best. I didnt read all of the comments but most were hating on the actors. First of all dont hate on Chris Pratt because hes AMAZING second of all the movie was supposed to focus more on the dinosaurs than the actual humans. The modifications to the I-rex were cool...hands down. I didnt expect much from the movie besides action and humor and there was plenty of that. JP 4 had me on the edge of my seat the entire time and I really dont appreciate all of these negative comments. How about you all get off your scientific plot -hole finding high horses and just appreciate the movie for what it is a non-stop action thrill ride that was meant for audiences to enjoy not to critique. And to those of you who say there are scientific plot holes NEWS FLASH its a HOLLYWOOD MOVIE things are made up 99.9% of the time. Get over yourselves please. Reply June 22 2015  by  Shane     This is the first of the Jurassic movies Ive seen. Nonetheless off the top I knew where the story was going. They have a new dinosaur. They want to confirm their enclosure is secure enough to keep their ""asset"" under control. Its going to escape. Duh. What else could happen really? This movie is predictable boring and lacking any kind of depth. It has lots of action and special effects but is about as exciting as any run-of-the-mill Hollywood action movie. Between in-your-face product placement (Starbucks anyone?) and the difficulty presented in detaching disbelief enough to just watch a movie I feel that someone should have paid me for the time and mental anguish incurred in watching this disaster of a movie. By the way it ended I was left thinking there will be yet another destruction-fest under the same name down the road. Truly a good example of ""sequel-itis."" Next time Im saving my money. Reply June 22 2015  by  Armond     God I hated this movie so much Reply June 22 2015  by  Alex     its a movie all this critique stuff is a waste of good time just go watch the movie for god sakes Reply June 23 2015  by  Patrick kelly     Oh my god you need to lighten up a bit  product placements seriously  you think thats all that this film is about ? this is 2015 where are you going to get a non branded jeep without people going Oh thats definitely a Mercedes or whatever ? This film was made to excite audiences to make them sit at the edge of their seats the CGI in this film I thought was fantastic and the acting was superb this is the best film that I have seen in cinemas in a long time Reply June 23 2015  by  jake     the biggest flaw I saw in the movie was how could the kids matches work after jumping in the river Reply June 25 2015  by  David     I completely agree with your review-and by the way I think you should just not post the folks who say ""you suck""-thats insulting and personal and shows a lack of intelligence as well. The writers here have no sense of how to develop a character. In fact they have scenes that only make sense if there were earlier character development scenes that had been cut out. Take for example the scene where Gray says ""he cant jump""-theres nothing thats come before to establish that he has a fear of heights yet when he jumps and the brothers have a quiet moment Zach says ""you jumped"" with joy and amazement and the brothers have a bonding moment but its completely hollow since the film never bothered to establish that this was an issue for Gray that Zach knew about in the first place This is just screenwriting 101 and yet heres a 200 million dollar picture written by a team of writers who dont seem to get this fundamental idea. Claires character was completely revealed in the 90 second trailer and nothing happens in the entire movie that wasnt predictable based on her very first scene. Same for Mr. Pratts character too. The only halfway interesting character in this movie is the billionaire played by Irrfan Khan who brings to the role with more depth than the script allows but who is killed off in a very uninteresting fashion halfway through the flick. And theres really very little advance in the special effects here. The new IRex doesnt really look scarier than the TRex and they dont even do a good job of highlighting its differences-how about a line about the fact that the forearms are now giant raptor claws rather than useless shrivelled tree limbs-like the TRex. TRex lasted for 300 million years with those useless forearms but the amusement park industry decided they needed to improve on evolution. And yes Mr. DOnofrio is completely wasted here which isnt an easy thing to do frankly. Reply June 27 2015  by  Christy Lemire     Thanks David but theres actually far more insulting (and misogynistic and profane) stuff that commenters post all the time that I dont approve. The internet is such a civilized place Reply June 26 2015  by  Mike Hunt     Product placement is the world we live in now a days... if you dont like it maybe you shouldnt be paid to review movies especially ones that attract a big audience. Stick to critiquing your daughters shitty plays. Reply June 27 2015  by  Christy Lemire     Actually I have a son. Reply June 27 2015  by  Dan     Ever been to Disney? Every ride IS sponsored by some company or other. So yeah the film wouldnt have been realistic otherwise. Reply July 22 2015  by  JozieLee     Could not disagree with you more Christy. Loved every unbelievable aspect of this movie. Great fun on a hot humid day. For two hours we blissfully reveled in the world jurassic. Did Owen (Chris Pratt) really think he could blast the iRex with that puny gun? Hahahaha. Was Owen really the alpha male? Hahahahahahaha Could he really ""talk to the animals""? Hahahahahaha Could Owen be pining for Claire (Bryce DH) after only one date? Puh-leaze Hahahahaha Could Owen really escape being eaten by dosing himself with motor oil? Hahahahhahaha Simon and his helicopter piloting. Hahahahahahahaha Jake Johnson with his glasses and dinosaur collection. Homage to the disgruntled techie in Jurassic Park who unleashed the first terror. Hahahaha A boatload of sophisticated weapons they couldnt contain the iRex. Hahahahahaha Kids in the bubble. RUN RUN RUNnnnnnnnn. Loved it Only one plot point was thought-provoking Using Raptors as war weapons. Kinda makes ya think maybe in some mad world a scientist could invent something as lethal. Imagine a team of iRexes unleashed on a population. Yipes Reply October 22 2015  by  Gordon     I did not see this movie after seeing a trailer of it where an adult says to two kids ""Remember if a dinosaur is chasing you run"" with a smile on her face. To make light of something that horrific turned me off completely it was as though the filmmakers were saying heres another pile of crap we are going to give you enjoy while we make millions. When are people going to stop believing that to enjoy an entertaining movie you have to turn your brain off and be mindless zombies? Movies should be thought provoking as well as entertaining no matter what the genre is. Thank you Christy. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

By Anthony Lane Chris Pratt with velociraptors in Colin Trevorrows movie.   Credit Illustration by Owen Freeman The star of ""Jurassic World"" is Indominus rex. She is not a reconstituted dinosaur of the sort that roamed through ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and its two sequels but a newfangled strain. The fangling was done in the lab and the outcome is ""a genetically modified hybrid."" We know that she is part Tyrannosaurus rex but the rest of her DNA is classified. My best guess having seen the movie is that she is six per cent chameleon three per cent Tasmanian devil and one per cent Joan Crawford. Indominus has her own compound with lush vegetation and high walls from which she cannot possibly escape. Yeah right. She did have a sibling but in a gesture of solidarity with sisters everywhere she ate it. Indominus lives and chomps on an island off Costa Rica--once the site of the first Jurassic Park and now the home of Jurassic World. Visitors flock there for a stress-free dino-sensation. Kids ride little triceratopses complete with saddles and there is even a petting zoo where you can hug a herbivore. The aquarium contains not dolphins but a mosasaur the size of a train which leaps playfully from the water to grab a dangled shark; spectators in the front row wear plastic ponchos to withstand the splash. What larks One advantage to naming a film after a theme park of course is that the script becomes an advertisement for its own wares ""Guest satisfaction is strong in the low nineties"" according to Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) a senior executive at Jurassic World. The main threat is posed by insouciance. ""No ones impressed by a dinosaur anymore"" we are told which is why the scientists--like the moviemakers--are compelled to devise new creatures. ""Consumers want them bigger louder more teeth."" Bring on the singing vampires. Claire is meant to be looking after her nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and his younger brother Gray (Ty Simpkins) who have been sent to the island by their parents and instructed to have fun. Claire however has problems. First she is not the mothering type. In case we fail to realize how buttoned up she is her all-white outfit is tightly buttoned up. Second the park is experiencing ""technical difficulties"" later upgraded to ""a containment anomaly."" Claire enlists the help of an ex-Navy man Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) telling him ""Wed like you to examine the paddock for vulnerabilities."" Quite right too. Nobody likes an unexamined paddock. Owen has been busy--get this--training velociraptors formerly the bad boys of the park to follow his command. He credits them not just with logistical nous but with ""social skills"" and its a matter of huge regret that the scene in which they pass around the olives didnt make the final cut. Owens efforts are hampered by the dastardly Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) for whom every homicidal dinosaur is a weapon just waiting to be cocked. ""Imagine if wed had these puppies in Tora Bora"" he says observing the raptors on the run. He has a point. The director of ""Jurassic World"" which is doggedly dull for the first hour and beefy with basic thrills for most of the second is Colin Trevorrow. Should you watch it through Oedipal eyes the entire movie can be parsed as an agonized wrestle with the influence of Steven Spielberg who having directed the first two chunks of the franchise remains as an executive producer. Whether he physically loomed over Trevorrows shoulder (Behind you--Auteurus rex) one cannot say but there is something craven and constricting in the attitude of the new film to the old. Michael Giacchinos score one long riff on John Williamss original theme is played at billowing volume to accompany Zach and Gray on a fascinating journey up the escalator and into their hotel room; and when they stumble upon the dome now overgrown where ""Jurassic Park"" reached its climax they stare in wonder as though at an Aztec temple. Other Spielbergian niceties are handled with a fraction of the Masters care. The prospect that the boys parents might be divorcing is raised from nowhere wept over for a single scene then dropped and Trevorrow even makes so bold as to repeat the famous shot of a predator glimpsed in a vehicles mirror. Spielberg capped it by showing the warning ""Objects in mirror are closer than they appear"" inscribed on the glass; in the new movie that is lost and with it goes the joke. On the other hand we have Chris Pratt. The most hopeful moment for moviegoers last year came in the opening minutes of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" when as a lonely figure on a blasted planet he donned a Sony Walkman and began to boogie to Redbones ""Come and Get Your Love."" Galactic pretensions were booted aside for the sake of a comic jaunt. At last it seemed here was the guy--hardly a hero let alone a super one--who could prick the Marvel bubble. So can Pratt do the same for all things Jurassic? Well hes relaxed enough and he certainly comes in handy once Indominus rex as feared goes on the lam. ""Shes learning where she belongs in the food chain"" he says--a line last heard incidentally during the Martha Stewart trial. Even Pratt though is outmuscled by the movie which trundles onward to a late slugfest that bows not only to ""Jurassic Park"" but to the rules of engagement laid down by ""King Kong"" requiring humans to yield the arena to the beasts. In short there is plenty here to divert but little to leave you enraptored. Such is the fate of the sequel Bigger. Louder. Fewer teeth. A boy in his teens arrives at a boarding school. Solidly built and friendless he is soon taken up by a gang of other boys and after a series of initiations accepted into their ranks. The pupils are largely unsupervised and at night they slip with impunity from the premises bent on theft and drinking. The staff are either out of sight or in blatant collusion with the gang; the woodworking teacher acts as pimp to two of the female students who serve the needs of truck drivers in a parking lot. Trouble arises when our hero grows attached to one of the girls and wants her for himself. What must he do to keep her? Such are the bare bones of ""The Tribe"" a new Ukrainian film directed by Myroslav Slaboshpytskiy. What fleshes out the movie and lends it such an extraordinary pulse of life is the want of words. All the main characters and the actors who portray them are deaf. The school is solely for the deaf and the school bell is replaced by flashing lights. Only in the closing credits do we learn that the new boy is named Sergey (Grygoriy Fesenko) and that the girl he has fought for is Anya (Yana Novikova). We have no voice-over to guide us no music and no subtitles to explain the sign language. Yet so vigorous are those signs and so unmistakably sore is the inflammation of feeling behind them that far from being shut out we are pulled all too fiercely into the dramas heart. Why Sergey has to strip for instance before the gaze of other boys remains unclear but the humbling is as fresh as a wound. Only once near the beginning do we see an actual classroom. (There is a map of Europe on the wall and the starred flag of the European Union a hint of the tensions that ignited the current strife in Ukraine.) Apart from that the normal structures of society whether inside the institution or beyond seem irrelevant and cracked and as with Jean Vigos ""Zero de Conduite"" (1933) still the most insolent of all boarding-school films the scurrility of the pupils bears a whiff of revolution on a wider scale. Vigo however took a jesters joy in disobedience and found time for a pillow fight that snowed unhurtful feathers whereas Slaboshpytskiy not content with all the natural rawness raging in the students loads his plot with extra violence. We get a mugging a head knocked in by a hammer and one poor fellow who being deaf is unwarned by the beeps of a truck that reverses toward him. The finale is frankly medieval and as for the illegal abortion performed over a filthy bathtub on someone who cannot call out in her distress there may have been bleaker scenes in the history of cinema but I would not care to see them. To be honest there are times when you feel moved to ask Can the frustrations of the inarticulate really be vented in no other way? Is the director not overdoing the brutishness in order to make a point? Against that you have to set the calm formality of his method almost never cutting within a sequence but allowing his camera to pause or glide with the flow. Then there is the sex--so often a laugh or a liability onscreen but touched here with an unexpected grace. One such scene is set on a concrete floor surrounded by heating pipes and another against a backdrop of blue wall. We hear the brush of skin on skin the sweet and wordless nothings of Anyas gasps and the kiss she bestows at the end--a good and naughty deed in a world gone bad. Whatever else ""The Tribe"" may be it is not a silent movie.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

""Lets face it"" she says ""no ones impressed by dinosaurs anymore."" This is in fact the central dilemma that has bedeviled Universal Pictures ever since its original 1993 Stephen Spielberg-directed hit Jurassic Park How ya gonna get em back in the seats after theyve seen T. rex?Related Story The Jurassic Park Period How CGI Dinosaurs Transformed Film In the first sequel the solution was to go with two T. rexes; in the next to pretend that the amphibious Spinosaurus aegyptiacus was a still more fearsome predator. (It almost certainly was not.) Now 14 years after the most recent installment of the franchise its custodians have come up with a new idea Scientists at the reopened park decide to genetically engineer a super-dino more terrifying than any to walk the Earth before it. The result is a hyper-intelligent hyper-aggressive monster spliced together from the DNA of a T. rex a cuttlefish a tree frog and at least one secret ingredient I will not reveal but youll probably guess on your own. Both the (fictional) park and the (real-life) studio are hoping this new creature Indominus rex will make for boffo box office.There are plenty such moments of commercial overlap between the movie and its subject matter. Jurassic World may be a make-believe place for instance but I assume Samsung still paid hard cash to get its name prominently displayed on the parks ""Innovation Center."" Indeed some of the cleverest moments in the movie play on the most cheesily recognizable elements of the theme-park experience the bored probably stoned attendants hustling kids on and off rides; the lamely comic introductory video in which a bumbling Jimmy Fallon plays himself.But the glazed quasi-contentment of the theme-park experience gives way to something more violent and dramatic soon enough. The Indominus gets out of her enclosure (of course); the park tries to keep its initial recovery efforts quiet from the tourists (of course); and things (of course) gradually go all to hell--notably when said tourists start getting picked off by dive-bombing pteranodons.Pinballing through the escalating dino-saster are a cast of character types so familiar that they represent brands almost as pre-sold as the movie they appear in.Pinballing through the escalating dino-saster are a cast of character types so familiar that they represent brands almost as pre-sold as the movie they appear in. Two squabbling teen brothers (Ty Simpkins Nick Robinson) are sent by their parents from the winter snows of home--""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" is playing in what may or may not be a deliberate inversion of Home Alone--for a little Jurassic recreation. Instead they sneak into a restricted part of the park and proceed to wander again and again into the jaws--often literal--of danger. But at least along the way they learn a valuable lesson about the meaning of brotherhood. (In one of the movies oddest twists the idea that the boys parents are getting divorced is brought up precisely long enough to squeeze out a couple of tears and is then forgotten entirely.)In theory the brothers are being looked after by their Aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) an executive at the tropical-island park off the coast of Costa Rica. But because she is a Tightly Wound Career Woman she instead foists the kids off on a careless assistant who promptly loses track of them. Howards character has already achieved some notoriety thanks to a critical tweet by Joss Whedon and she is almost exactly as awful as advertised shrill sexless unable to remember her nephews ages afraid not merely of flying but of flies. Fortunately with the help of charmingly roguish raptor wrangler Owen Grady (Chris Pratt)--who snatches flies out of the air single-handed--she gradually strips off her corporate couture to discover the tough tank-topped warrior woman beneath.One might assume that Pratts casting meant that his character would have some wit to him as with his Peter Quill in Guardians of the Galaxy. One would alas be mistaken. Owen is every bit as two-dimensional as the other characters in the film who also include a tedious baddie (Vincent DOnofrio) who wants to weaponize dinosaurs for the military; the billionaire owner of the park (Irrfan Khan) who also fancies himself a helicopter pilot; and Owens Nonwhite Best Friend (Omar Sy). The only actors in the film who appear to be having any fun at all are TV vets Jake Johnson (New Girl) and Lauren Lapkus (Orange Is the New Black) who receive minimal screen time as low-level park techs.That said this is not a movie that you go to for the human beings and the dinos on display are consistently first-rate from the armor-plated ankylosaurs to the whale-sized mosasaur to the wide variety of flying pterosaurs. Director Colin Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed) has a nice eye for the action sequences and he keeps the film moving along at a sharp enough clip that its deficiencies of characterization and plot never quite prove fatal. (Among the latter is the decision to release a pack of deadly poorly trained velociraptors in the hopes that theyll hunt down the Indominus a plan that practically comes in a manila envelope with ""What Could Possibly Go Wrong?"" stamped on it in red lettering.)Whether one considers the movie to be giddy with nostalgia or flat-out drunk will largely come down to a matter of taste.Though Jurassic World is probably the best addition to the franchise since the first film it nonetheless lacks the innocent wonder of its predecessor. This is perhaps inevitable--the ""no ones impressed by dinosaurs anymore"" quote carries more than a whiff of truth after all--and for the most part the movie wisely responds by foregoing quieter moments in favor of big set pieces. One exception a scene in which Owen and Claire stop to grieve over a pack of dying herbivores when theyre supposed to be rushing to save her nephews from a grisly imminent death represents an unusual--and frankly remarkable--misstep.That said fans of the first Jurassic Park will find this latest installment stuffed to overflowing with references and callbacks Park founder John Hammond (played by Richard Attenborough in the earlier films) is name-dropped constantly; a dilophosaurus rears its frilly head in a holographic display; and the boys stumble into the ruined lobby of the original park where they find a tooth of that very first T. rex. Whether one considers the movie to be giddy with nostalgia or flat-out drunk will largely come down to a matter of taste.Late in the film as all hope seems (once again) lost the younger of the two brothers declares that in order to defeat the Indominus ""we need more teeth."" Those four words are a wonderfully concise and elegant enunciation of the ethos undergirding the entire movie. If you limit your expectations for Jurassic World to ""more teeth"" it will deliver on that promise. If you dare to hope for anything more--relatable characters narrative coherence--youll only set yourself up for disappointment.

Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place.

Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

"Rex n FX The Charming Jurassic World << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Rex n FX The Charming Jurassic World Universal Pictures Movies June 12 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Some movies are just movies. But if you whack some of them right they turn out to be pinatas. Thats Jurassic World a split-open pinata whose candy innards are made from other peoples hits. It knows this about itself. The plot for example is built around a spectacular gene-splicing snafu. Enthusiasm for the eponymous island theme park has plateaued so the science and business teams -- in secret collaboration with security contractors -- have engineered an attraction whose full genetic provenance is as obscure as a hot dogs. Its part T. rex part stuff you dont want to know. Dont ask just say aaahhh They call this new thing Indominus rex. Its smart and sentient and eager to create a diversion in order to escape its confines and go on a killing spree. (It ate its sibling -- presumably given its sophisticated pedigree with some fava beans and a nice Chianti.) Summer Movies 2015 Rex n FX The Charming Jurassic World How Hollywood Grows New Spielbergs Killing It Spy and Sharing Comedic Wealth; Plus the Masturbatory Entourage Mad Max As Hell The Masterful Maniacal Surprisingly Feminist Fury Road Blah Cappella The Mess and Minor Insult of Pitch Perfect 2 Nerd Plus Ultron There Has to Be More to Avengers Age of Ultron Than Printing More Money All of our summer movie content The movie is produced by Steven Spielbergs Amblin Entertainment and has been made in small but enjoyably slavish deference to his and its catalogue. That should feel unseemly but theres something satisfying about how the allusions just keep pinballing off each other slapped into motion by killer dinosaurs. Director Colin Trevorrow and the three other credited writers are stealing used parts to make a newish car. Take Gray and Zach (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) the two brothers at the center of the run-for-your-life adventure plot. Gray is the little overeager geek who can identify DNA sequences and knows everything about every ancient animal species. Zach is too cool and too hormonal to care about that or the dinosaur theme park theyve been shipped to so their parents (Judy Greer Andy Buckley) can finalize their secret divorce. This is shameless Amblin schmaltz. The brothers are straight from The Goonies and of course Spielberg is merely among the most talented of directors to combine fantasy (or doom) with a broken-home story line just to build a stronger house. And Simpkins has been given a big mop-top haircut that intensifies his breathtaking resemblance to Melinda Dillon who played the single mom in Spielbergs Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the mother-wife in Amblins 1987 sub-E.T. hit Harry and the Hendersons. Hes as wonderfully emotional and bright-faced as both Dillon and Sean Astin who played the nerdy kid brother in Goonies. Thats one example but the movie just keeps going remolding the movies hero Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) in the image of Indiana Jones and his eventual love interest Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) into that of one of Indys sparring partners. Claire runs the park and is the boys estranged careerist maternally clueless aunt. The movie buys Spielbergs idea that maternal instinct is something that danger brings out whether youre a Stegosaurus or a woman. But the writings not there for Howard the way it is for some of the other actors like BD Wong as a frigid geneticist; Jake Johnson who plays one of the parks control-room-bound technicians; Vincent DOnofrio as a paramilitary heavy; and Irrfan Khan whos so typically charismatic as the parks billionaire owner that its scandalous he wont get a recycled franchise of his own. Howards got a short sharp-angled haircut (and remains trapped as Joey to Jessica Chastains Friends) and spends the first half of the movie knifing across the screen like a power-suited dorsal fin. She and Pratt get a little wet and her hair relaxes as the romance kicks in and the movie leaves Spielbergs farm to evoke stuff like the bantering that Kathleen Turner does with Michael Douglas in Romancing the Stone. Nothing here is that playfully lascivious. But the movie has fun shoving in the reference along with everything else. Owens a motorcycle-riding safariwear-clad chauvinistic man of science. Theres no bullwhip. Theres none of the macho panache that Ford had in wielding it either. There isnt even a field of study upon which to hang the thing. All we know is that Owen has learned to train lethally frisky velociraptors and abhors what Claire and her boss have done with science in the name of capitalism. The movie loves this character and it loves Pratt. We no longer manufacture Fords so Pratts anti-serious permanent adolescence will have to do. Having recently rewatched Spielbergs first two Jurassic Park movies from 1993 and 1997 respectively I was startled anew by how self-consciously hot Jeff Goldblum is in those movies. Sadly we dont even make his kind of strapping nebbishness anymore. But Pratt caroms inoffensively from one set piece to the next arriving at every joke on time with a smirk or a wink. At 35 thats his appeal -- hes the frat house Eagle Scout.  Chuck Zlotnick/Universal PicturesThe mayhem around the outbreak gives the movie its fun. Whats in the pinata is nice but you dont need to spot the references to like this movie. Thats part of its indolent cynical shrewdness Jurassic World doesnt work on its own terms per se but it does work as a new arrangement of terms that have already succeeded in other movies. It has such wild carefree energy that Trevorrow isnt even paying tribute to Spielbergs meticulous craftsmanship or what he did with the original Jurassic Park which is as perfect a backdoor horror film as an action-adventure gets. Hes saluting the dumb crazed part of Amblins spirit its everybody-into-the-pool sense of summer -- the part that prizes Spielberg the sensation over Spielberg the artist. In that sense the film has more in common with Joe Dante who did Amblins Gremlins in 1985 and its gonzo 1990 sequel and Amblins cofounder Frank Marshall who did 1990s Arachnophobia. In Jurassic Worlds best set piece the parks pterodactyls flee their aviary and attack the hundreds of patrons many of whom are languishing near the restaurants and shops waiting to get off the island. Another movie would have played this sequence for horror but here the rushing zooming chaos is actually funny. One guy runs for his life with a cup of beer in each hand which is very late-1980s/early-90s Hollywood an era in which emotional gravity was meant to be defied as weirdly as possible. These were the times of the gigantic worms of Tremors and the upside-down family comedy of Honey I Shrunk the Kids. Even the comic-strip and comic-book movies -- Warren Beattys Dick Tracy Tim Burtons Batman -- had a piety-free pop edge. Trevorrow was a teenager when these movies came out. These are now the movies coming out of him the way Alfred Hitchcock and John Ford came out of Spielberg. Trevorrows only other film is a science-fiction romance between Mark Duplass and Aubrey Plaza called Safety Not Guaranteed. People liked it although Im not sure why. Its charm was entirely mechanical driven by obnoxious characters one of whom was played by Jake Johnson who has one scene too many in Jurassic World. I left Safety Not Guaranteed convinced only that the person who made it really wanted to make more expensive Hollywood movies. By the flaccid ending it was clear the movie didnt have anything to say other than ""hire me."" Rightly a lots been made of Trevorrow having been chosen to make Jurassic World. Hes in a class of whos-that? directors whove moved from the obscurity of having made an independent film that people liked to the sort of Hollywood blockbuster that anyone could have made. In one sense who cares? In another sense its dismaying. As Alex Pappademas pointed out on Grantland earlier this week the crime resides in the movies unmade by these theoretically body-snatched directors. Who are they outside of the franchises theyve been sucked into? The task before Trevorrow and his peers -- all men all young all white all caught up in the franchise sweepstakes -- seems thankless. Its filmmaking sure. Its also a form of caretaking. Theyre expected to toe a well-established commercial line to deliver tradition. No ones asking for personality just a familiarity with how the Tupperware works. This is different from the movies 1990s boomlet of repurposed television shows where the goal was to laughingly deconstruct what the culture once held dear. When those movies worked (and only a few did the second Addams Family and The Brady Bunch for instance) they did so both as nominal comedies and pop criticism. There was also the sense that the movies had found ways of making money off of TV while also calling TV stupid. By comparison movies have always been self-consecrating. You dont go back to Star Wars in order to shit on it. You go back because the congregation demands a snazzier church. Im not sure whos been clamoring for another Jurassic Park. And that lack of urgency takes pressure off the movie. Safety Not Guaranteed was a limp audition for this movie -- and you know what? The dinosaur movie is better. Sure the human materials arent what they used to be and because the film keeps repeating a joke involving a particular dinosaur the vicious finale isnt quite exciting enough to put up with waiting for the punch line to come around yet again. But Trevorrow is having fun taking as little of this as seriously as he needs to. Unlike San Andreas which is both intentionally and accidentally old-school funny this movie appreciates that its mere existence is a hoot. Jurassic World is the fourth installment of something that now feels fresher -- or at least far less stale -- than its age. Who can say whether the pop wax-museum quality comes from Spielberg or from Trevorrows memories of having once been 13 at the movies? It just matters that when its over hes made you feel 13 at the movies too.  Focus Features Everything about the new Insidious movie is not-quite. The writing directing set design makeup acting effects Its all a rung below professional. The demonic possession makes no sense even by the genres standards. At least every time I left one of the Insidious movies (were bafflingly up to three) there was talent to notice -- almost none of that showed up this time. Ty Simpkins was little Dalton Lambert heir of Patrick Wilsons astral projection powers in the first two movies. Now hes warming my heart in Jurassic World. Series cocreator James Wan directed Parts 1 and 2 then went off to Furious 7. (He makes a cameo in Chapter 3.) This leaves Leigh Whannell to man the helm of this prequel. He and Wan also created and watched over most of the Saw movies but its clear Whannells not the director of the duo. This movie has the dusty feel of antique television. The framing of the action and the actors is often off -- or cut away from too soon or too late. The budget is almost 10 times that of the first film but looks as if it cost 10 times less. For all three Whannell cast himself as a kind of ghostbuster alongside Angus Sampson whos a poor mans Nick Frost. Theyre lifeless performers who arent even trying to keep up with say poor Dermot Mulroney whos at his wits end playing the desperate single dad of a possessed teenage girl (Stefanie Scott). But the whole thing almost justifies itself as a valentine to Lin Shaye who has played the bereaved medium Elise in all three films. Chapter 3 is more about her and therefore oddly sweetly compelling. Shayes an entertainment veteran who has allowed the years to remain lined along her open handsome face. No matter how absurd these movies get -- especially this one which regrettably gives Elise one of those ""get away from her you bitch"" moments -- Shaye elevates her scenes out of mediocrity and somehow touches your heart with plainspoken line delivery and eerie familiarity. Officially Wan and Whannell are messing with paranormal activity. But Shaye cuts warmly to the chase. She keeps putting the ""aunt"" in ""haunted house.""

"Jurassic World starring Chris Pratt Bryce Dallas Howard and Indominus rex reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Jurassic World May Be Stupid but Its Dino-on-Human Action Is Extra Crunchy Jurassic World May Be Stupid but Its Dino-on-Human Action Is Extra Crunchy Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 12 2015 1039 AM Jurassic World A whomping good time as long as you dont pay too close attention. By Dana Stevens Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) roam among the dinosaurs in Jurassic World. ILM/Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment Midway through Jurassic World two young brothers come across a storage building thats essentially a crypt full of artifacts from Steven Spielbergs 1993 smash hit Jurassic Park. Moldering away in there is the boxy 1992 Jeep Wrangler in which Laura Dern so memorably fled the Tyrannosaurus rex. (You can learn how to soup up your own vehicle to resemble it if your affection for Jurassic Park runs that deep.) An old Jurassic Park banner--not unlike the one that drifts ironically past the T. Rex at the climax of the first movie--gets rolled up by the older boy to be used as a torch--an old prop turned fuel for the new movies purposes. In Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow--a surprise pick for the job given that his only previous dramatic feature was the modest sci-fi indie Safety Not Guaranteed--pays homage to the Spielberg original even as he mulches it. But from that mulch grows a pretty robust hybrid for both good and ill--which I guess is appropriate for a film thats all about the joy and stupidity of bringing back dinosaurs. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Jurassic World the third and (for whatever its worth) probably best sequel to Jurassic Park is an old-fashioned monster movie. Its also a special-effects extravaganza that pushes the boundaries of digital world-creation. A cash grab exploiting nostalgia for a recognizable summer franchise. A preachy re-re-re-retelling of Frankenstein. An ickily retrograde gender parable if you stop and think about it for a minute. A whomping good time if you dont--and who has time to think when theres a genetically engineered megadinosaur on the loose? Jurassic World is set in the present day a technology-jaded age in which a generation after the opening of the first cloned-dino theme park enormous prehistoric lizards have become old hat. In fact the older of the two brothers Zach (Nick Robinson) doesnt even want to be at Jurassic World--hes more interested in flirting with every girl he sees. But the younger Gray (Ty Simpkins a shaggy-haired boy with old-school Spielberg-kid appeal) is a dinosaur nerd whos thrilled to be exploring the carefully controlled wonders of the now purportedly danger-free park which takes up a whole (fictional) island off the coast of Costa Rica. Big ideas about nature and ethics get chewed over nearly as thoroughly in the first half of Jurassic World as theme-park patrons do in the second. Advertisement The person insisting the hardest that this new dino enclosure is seriously the safest place ever not like the last time or the time before that or that first really scary time is the boys aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) the chilly business-obsessed manager of the park. Claire speaks almost exclusively in corporate jargon quoting focus-group feedback like its scripture and referring to the dinosaurs as ""assets."" ""Theyre not assets theyre animals"" replies the parks resident expert on dino behavior Owen (Chris Pratt)--maybe not in those exact words but in very similar ones and in multiple scenes. Ideas about nature technology ethics and corporate greed get chewed over nearly as thoroughly in the first half of Jurassic World as theme-park patrons do in the second. Claire and Owens ideological differences over the parks mission have made them steer clear of each other in the past especially after a long-ago date left them each with a bad impression of the other. But they have to team up when Claires nephews go off-roading in a Gyrosphere--a sort of transparent hamster-ball vehicle for humans made for touring the tightly patrolled grounds of the park--and wind up being chased by Indominus rex herself. The Indominus rex. Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment Not familiar with that terrifying dinosaur species? Not to worry it never existed ... or at least hasnt yet. The unthinkably colossal Indominus is the sole surviving member of a new super-species a custom blend whipped up by the parks chief genetic engineer (B.D. Wong) to satisfy the public demand for ever bigger hungrier scarier dinosaurs. (Comment on the contemporary film industry noted and filed.) I couldnt help but think that Owen should have been consulted much earlier on the project as he reasonably points out that breeding a creature to have all the traits of an ultra-predator and then raising it alone in captivity with no opportunity to hunt is a foolproof recipe for ... making a lot of people ingredients in that dinosaurs foolproof recipe. Because Claire is a bottom-line lets-get-this-done kind of lady Ill be one too Jurassic World delivers all that could reasonably be expected from a non-Spielberg-directed decades-later entry in this only semi-beloved franchise. The human stories are often hokey but theyre really just frames on which to hang the suspense sequences--we have to care about some characters enough that we mind if theyre plucked from the Earth by flocks of pterodactyls. (That happens to one supporting character who didnt really do anything to ""deserve"" it and you feel for her--but her surprise demise is so cleverly staged that it plays as a dark comic twist rather than a gruesome comeuppance.) Other characters--especially Vincent DOnofrio as a gung-ho military type who wants to train Chris Pratts beloved velociraptors for use as weapons--do seem to be cruisin for a bruisin in the dinosaur department and they get it. Irrfan Khan plays a more morally ambiguous figure the proud owner of Jurassic World a company he believes in so deeply hes blind to the hubris implicit in its very existence. I could have lived without the films implication that by privileging her dino-park career over settling down and having babies Bryce Dallas Howards character is indirectly responsible for the whole Indominus incident. (No one ever flat-out says this but its the subtext of a plot involving Judy Greer as the boys mother whos left them in their aunts icy unmaternal hands for the weekend.) And yes the romantic subplot between Pratt and Howard in which he slowly breaks down her defenses just by being his sexy dino-handling self is a little on the me-Tarzan-you-Jane side. But you dont go to the fourth Jurassic Park movie for up-to-date gender politics. You go for the crunchy dino-on-human action and Jurassic World provides plenty of that. Top Comment OMG the dinosaurs got out AGAIN Can you believe it?  More... -punkTaoist Join In Weve been living with CGI long enough now that its easy to forget that in the original the velociraptors were played in part by stunt performers in suits. In this film some of my favorite scenes are the quieter non-chase interactions that use not digital technology but puppetry to render the dinos heads and faces in close-up. The Indominus rex is strangely one of the least scary predators in Jurassic World maybe because vast differences in scale are one of the hardest things to render believably via digital effects. Its when Indominus hangs out with creatures of her own computer-generated kind--as in the spectacular final multi-dino smack down--that we finally get a good look at her relative size. When we do its hard not to feel a burst of awe at the fact that such creatures as these once walked the Earth. (OK not the genetically engineered mega-predator but the others who are still pretty goddamn huge.) Its that emotion more than anything else that makes me believe anyone would rebuild anything as comically unwise as a cloned-dinosaur theme park--and that somehow makes me willing to revisit that ridiculous but exciting place all over again.

The enlightened techie had spent much time explaining to Claire the buttoned-up control-freak park executive played by Bryce Dallas Howard that dinosaurs are living creatures not property to be programmed but he might as well have been speaking in Urdu. Claire had her mind on other things like getting Verizon to sponsor the exhibition of said genetically modified and relentlessly evil super-dinosaur because theme parks like Jurassic World have to keep innovating or people will spend their leisure dollars at... well theres not much competition in the DNA-reconstituted-dinosaur amusement park industry but capitalism makes you paranoid. In any case Claire had also been saddled with two nephews (Ty Simkins and Nick Robinson) whom she hadnt seen in years and to whom she has no maternal attachment having no family instincts whatsoever as her sister (Judy Greer) keeps reminding her. But you can bet that in the course of Jurassic World those buttons of Claires will be unbuttoned that tight skirt torn to the top of her thigh and those maternal instincts sent into overdrive. As San Andreas has recently demonstrated theres nothing better than hundreds of millions of dollars of computer-generated pandemonium to bring a family together. Oh who cares about that? Its a marauding dinosaur movie. In IMAX and 3-D which is essential in this case. Its a ride Shell out for the biggest and most kinetic experience. Because whatever else you say about Jurassic World its amazing special effects -- not just hurtling dinosaurs but flying killer pterodactyls -- make it one of the most rousing people-running-away-from-stuff movies ever made. At its best its good enough to take your mind off its worst which is saying a lot. ""Those people"" who ""never learn"" are of course the overweening Frankenstein-esque scientists who as summed up in the immortal epitaph of Ed Woods Bride of the Monster have ""meddled in Gods domain."" Why exactly theyd want to create a cunning near-unstoppable giant predator in close proximity to 20000 people with no evident evacuation plan is a question we must leave to their insurance company -- and Im thinking after the fade out that someones head is going to roll. I mean someone elses head. Before the ""Indominus Rex"" pulls a Houdini to slip out of its enclosure Jurassic World has one of those Towering Inferno set-ups where we meet the characters among them Irrfan Khan as the effusive billionaire park owner who tells Claire ""The key to a happy life is to accept that you are never in control."" More important weve also had the opportunity to oooh an aaah over what you can do with computers these days. The dinosaurs look much more real than the human extras. Kids ride baby triceratops. Teens drive in what look like giant clear-plastic hamster balls past serene leaf-chewing prehistoric herbivores. In the Sea World-like pool at the center of the park a humongous Godzilla-crocodile leaps up and swallows a dangling Great White Shark. Thats evidently meant as a good-natured in-joke aimed at executive producer Steven Spielberg though it reminded me that Jaws is still the greatest giant-monster thriller ever made with a pretty lame mechanical shark and no computer effects whatsoever. This films stop-the-presses headline is that those once-blood-freezing velociraptors are becoming domesticated -- or at least trained to gaze on humans as something besides lunch. Their principal handler is Owen played by Chris Pratt a muscular guy in a leather vest who tools around Jurassic World on a motorcycle stopping only to bond with raptors or try to talk military-industrial bigwig Vincent DOnofrio out of using the creatures as weapons of mass destruction. Im not kidding DOnofrio says that with velociraptors Tora Bora would have been a cakewalk. I was thinking that was a stupid idea even by the standards of dumb sci-fi movies -- but then I remembered what Rumsfeld et al actually did do at Tora Bora and it seemed relatively sound. Pratt the former sitcom star transformed himself into a goofy wisecracking hunk in Guardians of the Galaxy and is here just a hunk. Hes fine. Hunky. Hunky dory. But his character has no arc and you forget about him after a while except as a mate for Bryce Dallas whose character he once dated and decided was too buttoned-up. The key symbolic moment is when she gazes into his eyes and defiantly unbuttons her top. The part is a sexist cliche but Im bound to say I think Howard sure is purty and liked watching her so sue me. (No actually dont sue me. Title IX does not apply to film critics.) Director Colin Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed) cribs his wittiest set-ups from Spielberg Im sure with the executive producers blessing if not insistence. But witty they are. The pterodactyl attacks are shot and edited so combustively that they dont need splatter to make you cry out and the fluidity with which the dinosaurs weave around the humans is enough to convince you that there were dinosaur-wranglers standing by who knew their stuff. The sole disappointment is that the Indominus Rex doesnt quite live up to its pedestal being just an unusually mean albino-ish... dinosaur. But its a testament to marvels elsewhere in Jurassic World that we would even think of looking this gift dinosaur in the mouth.

"Review Jurassic World is a walk in the Park - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Jurassic World is an enjoyable walk in the Park Jurassic World Universal Pictures Zach (Nick Robinson left) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) roam among the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic World."" Zach (Nick Robinson left) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) roam among the dinosaurs in ""Jurassic World."" (Universal Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Jurassic World is a fun family movie with teeth but some may find in just an enjoyable walk in the Park Think of ""Jurassic World"" as a family film with teeth. Lots of teeth.Most of those fangs come courtesy of the Indominus rex a genetically modified dinosaur a killing machine 50 feet long and 18 feet high that would sooner take a bite out of you than look at you. A lot sooner. But dont let all that dental flash fool you even if it does lead to as many open-mouthed shots as a documentary on orthodonture. Starring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard ""Jurassic World"" specializes in the genteel PG-13 scare aiming to awe you with its dinosaur verisimilitude rather than shock you with too much blood on the tracks.INDIE FOCUS Sign up for our weekly movies newsletter In this it is the clear descendant of the original 1993 Steven Spielberg-directed ""Jurassic Park"" which took novelist Michael Crichtons science-fiction concept of creating dinosaurs from their DNA and used state-of-the-art computer-generated effects to bring them to life as theyd never been before. As Spielberg says in press notes ""technologically it was a benchmark for the entire industry."" This new Jurassic film works hard to connect itself with its blockbuster progenitor including having a character wear an original logo T-shirt (purchased on EBay) talking a lot about visionary scientist Dr. John Hammond and bringing back the fan favorite velociraptors for an elaborate star turn.But despite the best efforts of director Colin Trevorrow ""Jurassic Worlds"" story of Indominus rex on the loose while certainly acceptable doesnt have the same impact as the initial film. You cant experience first love twice and even though these CGI dinosaurs are doubtless more realistic than whats come before the magic of those unprecedented moments is beyond recapturing. Jurassic World is Trevorrow Land Josh Rottenberg ""Jurassic World"" director Colin Trevorrow was having lunch on the Universal Pictures lot on a recent afternoon when the chairman of the studio Donna Langley came up to his table with a big smile on her face.  Langleys 6-year-old son had just been visiting her office she told Trevorrow and... ""Jurassic World"" director Colin Trevorrow was having lunch on the Universal Pictures lot on a recent afternoon when the chairman of the studio Donna Langley came up to his table with a big smile on her face.  Langleys 6-year-old son had just been visiting her office she told Trevorrow and... (Josh Rottenberg) Though ""Jurassic World"" is only his second feature Trevorrow was an intriguing choice to direct it because his first film the sweetly eccentric science-fiction fable ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" gave promise of someone who (along with his writing partner Derek Connolly) could bring warmth and quirky sensibility to a genre situation. Rewriting a script by ""Planet of the Apes"" rebooters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver Connolly and Trevorrow have done as well as they could. But that their sensibility is present only around the edges tells you everything you need to know about how the demands of tent-pole filmmaking make any kind of genuine originality fiendishly difficult.The central notion of ""Jurassic World"" is that it is also set 22 years after the original film and its deadly goings-on. Billionaire Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan a long way from ""The Lunchbox"") the worlds eighth-richest man has taken Dr. Hammonds concept and run with it turning Isla Nublar off the coast of Costa Rica into a smooth-running tourist Jurassic World attraction hosting 20000 dino-curious visitors daily.Among those 20000 are brothers 11-year-old enthusiast Gray (Ty Simkins who made an impression in ""Iron Man 3"") and bored-with-it-all 16-year-old Zach (Nick Robinson). Before they leave mother Karen (Judy Greer) gives them what turns out to be prescient advice ""If something chases you run.""Waiting for them on the island in body if not in spirit is Karens sister Claire (Howard). Though she is supposed to show the boys around as the parks efficient operations manager Claire has a lot more on her agenda.Because focus groups and attendance figures both indicate that ""no one is impressed by a dinosaur anymore"" Claire and the rest of management are faced with pressure to grow the business. So scientist Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong the only actor returning from the original) has been set loose in the lab and Claire has to find corporate funding to sponsor his new beast. (Think ""Verizon Wireless presents Indominus rex."")Also facing unwanted pressure is Owen Grady (""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star Pratt) a world-class dinosaur whisperer who has managed to train those pesky Velociraptors (played by performers in motion-capture suits). That has brought him to the attention of the nefarious Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) who has designs on militarizing the nasty beasts and using them to replace boots on the ground. ""Extinct animals"" he reasons ""have no rights."" Just imagine.It doesnt take a lot of vision to guess that three things will happen in short order. First impressive security notwithstanding the Indominus true to its name will make a bold bid for freedom. Second Claires nephews will inadvertently wander into his killing zone. Third Claire and Owen whove had one bad date and dont particularly care for each other will have to join forces if there is any chance of stopping Indominus before he terminates everything in sight.Though his TV background in ""Parks and Recreation"" was more comedic Pratt proved in ""Guardians"" that he could handle hunky leading man roles and his combination of physicality charisma and attitude prove hard to resist one more time.Costar Howard is solid as well but she has a tougher challenge because Claire is a woman caught between paradigms having to be both the traditional studio movie damsel in distress trapped in high heels and todays capable action heroine. Howard does as well as anyone could but the strain is sometimes visible.Not even breaking a sweat by contrast are the films more traditional dinosaurs beasts like the enormous crocodile-like Mosasaurus and the cute Triceratops found in a petting zoo. Mostly these are computer creations but as a tribute to the original films effects wizard Stan Winston a huge Apatosaurus is created with animatronics technology.

They both require the firm hand of Chris Pratt for starters Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Action movies Bryce Dallas Howard Chris Pratt Colin Trevorrow Dinosaurs Genetic modification Genetics jurassic world Movies Science Fiction and Fantasy science-fiction Steven Spielberg Summer movies Entertainment News (Credit Universal Pictures) So I watched ""Jurassic World"" in one of those gigantic movie theaters in Times Square that resembles a vertical shopping mall or theme park. (In the case of this particular theater with its notoriously non-working escalators a theme park in Bulgaria circa 1997.) People liked it and even cheered at the end which struck me as a symptom of movie-industry insider relief rather than genuine elation. Beyond a couple of big hits like ""San Andreas"" and the ""Avengers"" sequel it looks like another downward-trending summer season for Hollywood. From the standpoint of all those reasonably intelligent and somewhat well-meaning people in Los Angeles County who are worried about mortgage payments and Audi leases and private-school tuition ""Jurassic World"" unquestionably ""delivers."" It feels like a hit; it offers a professionally crafted blend of blandness predictability watered-down cultural commentary and manufactured excitement.But that was not exactly my point just as the specific and individual qualities of the film called ""Jurassic World"" which was directed by Hollywood neophyte Colin Trevorrow from a script that probably went through 16 drafts by 43 writers and which stars Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard as denatured holograms of themselves are not exactly the point. (I exaggerate but not by much There are five credited writers on this film which almost always means that numerous others got paid off at some point and dont get their names on the screen.) Indeed Im not sure what specific qualities ""Jurassic World"" could be said to possess beyond a vague sense of its own importance that struck someone somewhere along the way as being witty or ironic but comes across in the finished product as preening self-congratulation.Oh yeah along with a bunch of big-ass CGI dinosaurs unleashed through human arrogance who stomp the craptastic insta-architecture of Jurassic World the 21st-century reboot of the dino theme park Steven Spielberg first showed us in 1993 into smithereens. That happens in every movie associated with this franchise I know - but the twist this time is that Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) the metrosexual Dr. Frankenstein first encountered in ""Jurassic Park"" has genetically engineered a new hybrid dinosaur species a highly intelligent super-predator built out of genetic fragments of T-rex Cthulhu the giant squid James Bonds original Aston Martin and Joan Rivers. OK some of that is not actually spelled out in the film but the secret sauce that makes the Badassosaurus or the Holycraposaurus or whatever its called so devious amounts to a massive non-spoiler in that we keep thinking that something really amazing and horrible is about to be revealed and it never is. New breakthroughs in Hollywood narrative formulaOnce again I have distracted myself from the main point which is that ""Jurassic World"" takes place in a giant mall - the Costa Rican dino island is now a multiply-branded retail experience with a Starbucks a Brookstone a Chilis (unless its an Applebees or a TGI Friday) that blends dinosaur-themed margaritas and so on - feels at the level of sensory input like going to a giant mall and will be watched by most paying audiences in a giant mall. Is that like social criticism or just a self-authenticating feedback loop? I made a note to myself at one point that ""Jurassic World"" keeps channeling ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" or at least trying to. But the problems with the simulation go beyond the fact that the elements that made those films so much fun have been rendered meaningless through repetition over the last 30-odd years. At the technological level of course Trevorrow has resources available that could not even be imagined in the 70s and 80s but the influences have been strangely strained and drained Its like ""Dawn of the Dead"" minus the critique of consumerism and ""Raiders"" minus the progressive gender politics. You Might Also Like Yes that last part is a joke a little bit Im not seriously arguing that the relationship between Harrison Ford and Karen Allen in ""Raiders"" marks some silver-screen ideal. But screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan deliberately tried to impart a period-appropriate flavor of screwball comedy to their repartee which is one of the elements that makes that movie so beloved. What we get in ""Jurassic World"" between mechanically inclined raptor-trainin he-man Owen (Pratt) and workaholic high-heeled career lady Claire (Howard) is at best a pallid and double-plus-ungood imitation of that. We know for sure both actors can be immensely enjoyable in the right context Pratt translated his ""Parks and Recreation"" comedy chops to the big screen perfectly well in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (and for that matter in ""The Lego Movie"") and Howards deliciously awful villainess was among ""The Helps"" saving graces. I felt as if I literally could not recognize them in this movie jammed into action-movie templates like a pair of teenagers in rented prom tuxedos.In fact I would argue that ""Jurassic World"" acts out a parallel which may be unconscious but is nonetheless profound between Howards stressed-out multitasking female executive (who calls the dinosaurs ""assets"" and has no time to spend with her teen and preteen nephews who are visiting the park when all heck breaks out) and the genetically engineered female super-dino. No hear me out; I swear this isnt totally crazy. Everything about Claire from her fussy hairdo white sheath dress and heels to her officious task-oriented demeanor is presented as essentially unnatural. She is a product of our diseased society rather than the healthy natural urges embodied by Owens massive chest his intuitive understanding of engines and his beastmaster relationship to the parks doglike pack of velociraptors. She needs to be rumpled tossed about and sexually dominated by Owen and she needs to reconnect to the beauty and rightness of the nuclear family - and if those impulses sometimes feel contradictory they ultimately point to the same destination of womanly perfection am I right? Almost all those things are also true of the she-demon dinosaur whose manipulative intelligence and deceptive wiles hint at a secret connection with the human female that is never made explicit. She absolutely needs to be confronted and conquered by Owen - if sexual domination were involved this would be a much more interesting movie - and subdued to the natural order of things which despite all the superficial changes of the last several thousand years apparently still involves hot but sensitive bearded dudes being in charge as in the book of Genesis. As a laboratory-bred abomination who has eaten her only sibling she has no nuclear family to whose embrace she may return. Such is the painful price of consciousness and of rebellion; like Miltons Satan she is the secret hero of her story (except that her storys not very good). Better to reign in hell than serve in heaven she says or rather roars and if those places dont exist then at least lets stomp the crap out of this Sunglass Hut. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Sometimes a movie mimics the qualities of its hero. If only that were the case with ""Jurassic World"" because animal researcher Owen Grady played by Chris Pratt is a no-nonsense and fun guy to hang with even under the kind of soil-your-pants duress a smart super-predatory dinosaur might cause. Instead this overblown attraction -- a narrative continuation of 1993s highly entertaining ""Jurassic Park"" -- shares the qualities of its antagonists the aforementioned genetically tweaked hybrid with the ginned-up name Indominus rex and the island theme parks head security contractor. It is an annoying assemblage of other movies (mostly by Steven Spielberg) and it is cynical and calculating. Vincent DOnofrio portrays security specialist Hoskins who sees weaponizing possibilities in the work Owen has been doing with a quartet of Velociraptors. ""What if wed had them in Tora Bora"" he says wistfully at a point when things are starting to get hairy ahem reptilian. This surprisingly predictable ride begins when brothers Gray (Ty Simpkins) and Zach (Nick Robinson) are sent by their soon-to-be-divorced parents to Isla Nublar the site of Jurassic World. Younger wildly curious Gray is thrilled at the prospect. Zach seems to be perfecting the teen pose of practiced uninterest. Though they havent seen her in years aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is too busy for true chaperoning and assigns her assistant the task. She runs the park for a pleasant-enough tycoon Masrani (personable Irrfan Khan). When things go awry shell discover what matters most. If you detect a whiff of sarcasm in that comment well the screenwriters -- director Colin Trevorrow among them -- seem to have rummaged in the same closet Claire grabbed her throwback white skirt suit from for their ideas. Is there a metaphor lurking in the fact that the lone Indominus rex -- raised in isolation and female -- has been genetically concocted by Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) to be white too? Were it worth the effort ""Jurassic World"" offers a bounty for deep readers of pop-cultural anxieties about gender race technology. Its not. Although some intrepid thinker might want to take on what it means that the filmmakers so cavalierly and violently dispatch a couple of veterans from the war in Afghanistan. In the films favor we appear to be living in an era that might be called the Chrisozoic Period in which an abundance of Chrisses strides the big screen. The affable Pratt joins the equally likable Hemsworth Pine and Evans. Bearded and weighing in with just the right balance of buff and heft Pratt makes a convincing and updated graduate of the Indiana Jones/Han Solo school of smart tough guy. Still the rebooters of this franchise are either colossally cynical or not very good spinning a yarn. Or maybe benefit of the doubt and all that this is a bad case of the anxiety of influence. Director Trevorrow was hand-picked by Steven Spielberg for the daunting assignment. Lest you forget who unleashed those dynamic dinos and has owned many a summer movie season there are plenty of winks and nudges beyond Gray and Zachs visit to the first park now overgrown with jungle vines. For the 40th-anniversary of ""Jaws"" a huge shark makes a cameo. Yet ""Jurassic World"" is ersatz Spielberg. Its a knock-off that even with the brand tag of the filmmaking titan as executive producer makes the credit feel faux. Even John Williams bombastic score seems like a rebuff. Early on a character remarks that the theme park with its ""de-extinction"" successes has led to hard-to-impress customers. Dinosaurs roaming the park just dont cut it. Customers want more. It sounds like commentary. But then the movie proceeds to gives us more and more and more. And less and less and less. Perhaps the movie should have been called ""Product Placement World."" Sure this has become movie-business as usual but you can still get marks for subtlety. Instead I think less of Mercedes-Benz -- and IMAX for that matter -- intruding on the screen with all the grace of a pop-up ad. ""Alright Mr. DeMille Im ready for my close-up.""

Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Bryce Dallas Howard Chris Pratt Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins star in Jurassic World. Universal Pictures Making the original Jurassic Park in the early 90s Steven Spielberg told the visual effects superband hed assembled -- Stan Winston for full-scale puppet dinosaurs; Phil Tippett for miniatures; Dennis Muren and Michael Lantieri for the photorealistic computer animation -- that their film would depict even its most predatory dinos as animals not monsters. In Jurassic World that distinction is long extinct. Jurassic Parks second-best sequel is set 22 years after velociraptor challenged tyrannosaur in the biggest movie of 1993. The Central American island dino-zoo that onetime flea-circus operator John Hammond spent his fortune to build has been open long enough for attendance to start to sag. Thats why this long-gestating fourth chapter boasts a bigger craftier never-was-found-in-nature dinosaur its features shaped not by evolution but by user-experience surveys. ""Customers want bigger louder more teeth"" says Claire the movies brittle shamed-for-her-childlessness Career Woman. Too focused on the next rung to recall the ages of her visiting nephews -- yeah sorry the requisite crying little kids are in this movie too -- shes the series latest reluctant foster parent and the latest thankless role on the resume of one Bryce Dallas Howard. But just as Dr. Wu -- B.D. Wongs dino-cooking geneticist the only human who reappears from the original film -- has crossbred various species to make his ""Indominus Rex"" Jurassic World liberally stirs in DNA from other blockbuster franchises Suddenly there are threads from the Alien pictures (amoral corporation wants to sell ungovernable beasts as weapons) and Terminator pictures (obsolete killing machine from films past rebooted to guard puny humans from its more advanced successor). Theres a pteranodon attack straight out of The Birds a movie that was 30 years old when Jurassic Park was new. And then theres Chris Pratts unflappable beefcake hero -- an archetype every prior entry in this series has managed to do without. Forget the Ph.D.-having Sam Neills and Jeff Goldblums of the Jurassic um period; this guy is all about keeping up with the Joneses. Well maybe not Crystal Skull. (Full potentially discrediting disclosure I enjoyed Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull to exactly the same degree I enjoyed Jurassic World.) Remember what a nice boy Pratt was when he used to be on TV? His transformation into a bulging grimacing action figure is now tragically complete. As Owen Jurassic Worlds resident Velociraptor Whisperer -- seriously they obey his commands -- he carries a lever-action rifle a firearm choice that pegs him as Hunter rather than Soldier just to distinguish him from those machine-gunning redshirts from ""Asset Containment"" who havent seen enough movies to respect the creatures theyre dispatched to take down. Owen speaks little jokes less wears tighter clothes (leather field vest sweaty henley) than anyone in the movie and hes never ever wrong. Boooooooo to all that. Guardians of the Galaxy let Pratt be a swashbuckler without burying his lovable-goofball side. You know something is wrong with your summer popcorn movie when your leading man smiles less than he did in Zero Dark Thirty. (Pratt was one of the SEALs who raided Osama Bin Ladens secret aboveground lair at the end.) In fact Jurassic World ascribes Owens Very Peculiar Set of Skills to the fact hes a former ""Navy man"" which is kind of like shrugging off the Coneheads weirdness on the grounds that theyre ""from France."" Maybe he trained dolphins to look for sea mines or something? When Claire goes looking for him after hours she finds him tinkering with a motorcycle. What did you think this guy does when hes not on the clock? Read? Pilates? Man-scape that immaculate chin-scruff of his? Wrong wrong wrong. But back to Claire. A far cry from the calm capable science women Laura Dern and Julianne Moore played shes supposed to be Jurassic Worlds director of operations but she walks talks and dresses more like a vice president of marketing type. This spreadsheet-keeping itinerary-revising LinkedIn user needs her sister the utterly wasted Judy Greer to tell her shell be happier once she has spawned but It Takes a Dude -- her boss in fact -- to tell her its not all about money its about putting smiles on peoples faces. (The screenwriters dont even let Claire say Gosh sorry for keeping the lights on at your scandal-plagued human-buffet family fun park Boss) She also needs Pratt to advise her that high heels are not suitable for jungle adventuring and to save her shrieking bacon again and again and again. When the movie finally comes around to letting poor Claire pick up a rifle and bag a winged dino thats taking its sweet time pecking Owens head off it practically rolls over and asks us to rub its scaly belly. Spielberg perhaps dismayed by the indignities of the Jaws films that followed his industry-reorienting classic agreed to direct Jurassic Parks first sequel 1997s The Lost World himself. His stand-in here is Colin Trevorrow who has made just one prior feature the quirky time-travel-romance-comedy Safety Not Guaranteed. Trevorrow proves capable of steering a literally 240-times-as-expensive ship and he apes Spielberg at least as well as seasoned company man Joe Johnston did in the forgettable Jurassic Park III. Theres a nice update of the original movies nocturnal T-Rex attack involving a GyroSphere -- a sort of armored-pope-glass hamster ball. And the grand finale dino fight plus a chase wherein Owen rides his motorcycle flanked by his squad of headset-wearing velociraptors is certainly worth 13 if youre as 13 years old as I am. Not much of Trevorrows own sensibility has survived the upscaling process though. A little of it comes through in Jake Johnsons funny scenes as um Glasses-Wearing Control Room Guy. Claire reprimands him for showing up to work in a T-shirt from the original Jurassic Park -- a morbid collectors item on account of the tragedy. ""I got it on eBay"" he says. About that Remember the original films interlude in the gift shop when the camera panned across shelves of officially licensed merch all of it available for real-world purchase? More than any blockbuster since Jurassic World is best appreciated as a metaphor for big-tent thrill-ride moviemaking that now more than ever seems in danger of swallowing up every other kind. Going meta is the only move its got left really. Consider the other four movies that rounded out 1993s box-office Top Five Mrs. Doubtfire. The Fugitive. The Firm. Sleepless in Seattle. In that long-ago far-away galaxy thrill machines like the ones that made Spielberg rich and beloved were still seasonal specialties. Now we get 25 of these per year from February to December and Mad Max sequels are progressive while Jurassic Park has gone retrograde. That last bits the unkindest raptor bite of all. For all Jurassic Worlds warnings about tinkering with nature its least persuasive feat of chemistry is its attempt to sell us the Beatrice-and-Benedick-style bickering foreplay between Owen and Claire. We never for one second buy that these two have a sexual attraction strong enough to overpower their mutual loathing for longer than a weekend. Then again opening weekend is all that matters. As some guy said a long time ago in some dinosaur movie nature finds a way.

Universal Pictures/Amblin Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Its been 14 years since the last of the three previous ""Jurassic Park"" movies so you cant exactly accuse Universal Pictures and Steven Spielberg of racing to cash in with ""Jurassic World.""Not much has changed in the interim aside from the fact that Colin Trevorrow with only one small prior movie to his credit has replaced Spielberg as director although in terms of its thrills and graphic design it still looks like a low-to-mid-range Spielberg effort. The world in ""Jurassic World"" harks back to Spielbergs 1993 original dispensing with the back story of the two previous (and much less successful) entries. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time The dinosaur theme park located on a Costa Rican island reachable by big boats resembles a cross between the Universal Studios tour and a mini-Epcot Center. Tourists mingle with genetically engineered herbivore dinos; the main attraction is a sea monster that shoots up out of his aquarium tank to gobble a great white shark dangling from a hook in midair. (Too bad the guys in ""Jaws"" didnt know about this.) The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Thrill-wise its all rather benign which is why a secret project is about to unleash a scary new T. rex - Indominus rex - that hopefully will boost attendance.Into the great maw of Jurassic World troops teenage Zach (Nick Robinson) and his geeky younger brother Gray (Ty Simpkins). Their aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) manages the place but aside from getting them VIP passes doesnt really keep an eye on them. She wears high heels in the jungle - that should tell you all you need to know. She also has an abrasive connection with former Navy stalwart and raptor wrangler Owen (Chris Pratt) that can only mean one thing - romance ahead  Alas their chemistry as inevitably they flee Indominus and Co. is something of a fizzle and the two boys are never sharply enough defined to make us care if they get gobbled or not. And since we know they wont be the tension with these two is even slacker. But Trevorrow and his co-screenwriters (Rick Jaffa Amanda Silver and Derek Connolly) do bring some nice low-key touches to the thudfest and action is satisfying if not galvanizing.Its nice to know too that in the intervening 14 years corporate greed - personified here by Vincent DOnofrios bad guy who wants to convert the raptors into superdrones - is as ripe as ever. And speaking of greed lets see if it takes another 14 years for the sequel.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 11 2015 1159AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 12 2015 422PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Colin Trevorrow Written by Rick Jaffa Amanda Silver Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow Starring Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt Classification PG Year 2015 Country USA Language English If Steven Spielbergs first Jurassic Park faced the daunting prospect of resurrecting dinosaurs the new Jurassic World produced by Spielberg but directed by Colin Trevorrow has more modest but still challenging ambitions Resurrecting the feeling of seeing Jurassic Park for the first time.In effect Jurassic World is the sequel as fan fiction with a nostalgic technical glow that hovers over the proceedings - romantically lit and shot characters jungle scenes captured in the rich colour dynamics of film not digital video and a score that frequently refers to John Williamss rousing Jurassic Park theme from 1993. At the same time the script is almost apologetically humorous about its derivative formula and blockbuster aims. The most ambitious thing about Jurassic World is that it asks moviegoers to sympathize with people struggling to keep a dinosaur entertainment franchise alive. Twenty years after the traumatic events of Jurassic Park (the two intervening movie sequels are wisely ignored) audiences have become jaded. Profits are dipping at Jurassic World a dinosaur zoo and research facility on the island of Isla Nublar off the Costa Rican coast. Tourists take cruise ships to the island and stay at luxury hotels ride in bubble-shaped cars through fields where peaceful herbivores graze or watch some sort of giant turtle-saurus leap out of the water and snap up sharks. Its all a little tame. Teenagers text and watch Jimmy Fallon videos on their phones while the guides like dolphin trainers show what tricks the big captive creatures can do.""No ones impressed by a dinosaur any more"" bemoans Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) the ultra-coiffed high-heeled corporate head of Jurassic World. She works for the super-wealthy adventurer and owner Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) who inherited the Jurassic franchise from John Hammond (Richard Attenborough).Determined to give the theme park a commercial makeover the executives have commissioned genetic scientist Henry Wu (B.D. Wong returning from the first film) to create something ""bigger scarier cooler"" to bring back the wow factor to the theme park. Theme-park management of course is a subject close to Universal Studioss own interests and the script consistently critiques corporate excess while celebrating the same. An obvious example is the way Jurassic World is stuffed with product placement while the ethics of branding is also a subject of debate among the brass in the movie.Jurassic Worlds new attraction (or disaster-waiting-to-be-unleashed) is called Indominus rex which is part T-rex but with a bunch of other creatures in its DNA mix (cuttlefish?) allowing the dinosaurs various powers to be revealed through the course of the movie.Along with the familiar sadistic kicks of watching creatures that lurch and chomp the most obvious Spielbergian element here is the emphasis on family bonding. As what used to be called a ""career gal"" Claire has no significant other or children but has some sense of family obligation. She agrees to babysit her two nephews glum bored teen Zach (Nick Robinson) and his geekily adorable dinosaur-obsessed younger brother Gray (Ty Simpkins) while their parents work out their divorce.Fortunately terrifying dinosaurs have a way of bringing human beings closer. Claire previously dated the old-fashioned macho dino trainer Owen (Chris Pratt) who works at the facility in a special program with raptors those speedy and relentless carnivores that starred in the first film. Owen is at odds with another former military man Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) who wants to turn dinosaurs into military assets. When Claire becomes concerned about the safety of Indominus rexs pen she has to call on Owen for advice. The timing is perfect He shows up on the same afternoon Indominus decides to make her move.The second half of the movie is mostly devoted to the logistics of moving Indominus around the island endangering the kids and the various stratagems of good and bad humans and dinosaurs. Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed) repeats favourite Spielberg tropes (different foreground and background scales giant things that arent noticed until they move slightly) without quite matching the latters intensity.The dinosaurs (animatronic CGI and puppets) are big (there are only a handful of shots where Indominus can be seen at her full height) and as far as we can guess impressively lifelike. The humans are somewhat less so. Several like DOnofrios jingoistic military man and Wongs amoral scientist are crude B-movie stock characters.As Owen Pratt - in pugnacious Indiana Jones mode - tones down the comedy from his star turn in last years Guardians of the Galaxy but has the right mixture of gravity and mischief. Less fortunate is Howard who stuck in retro girl fashion is mostly obliged to shed clothes and get sweatier and more dishevelled as the film progresses.Jurassic World never breaks out of its own confines of homage and imitation. The movie ends up as an awkward ungainly hybrid large but inconsequential.

Not the big biters in ""Jurassic World""--theyre digital in case you were wondering--but the filmmakers and studio executives who perpetrated this lumbering edition of the franchise that Steven Spielberg launched more than two decades ago.

"Jurassic World bites into big dumb dino action review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesJurassic World bites into big dumb dino action reviewJurassic World has so many clever thoughts rattling inside its big scaly head its almost too bad it happily settles for being dumb summer entertainment.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 11 2015Jurassic World Starring Chris Pratt Bryce Dallas Howard Vincent DOnofrio BD Wong Irrfan Khan Omar Sy Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins. Directed by Colin Trevorrow. At GTA theatres. 124 minutes. PGJurassic World has so many clever thoughts rattling inside its big scaly head its almost too bad it happily settles for being dumb summer entertainment.Chris Pratt plays a smart raptor wrangler Bryce Dallas Howard an unwise park manager and Vincent DOnofrio a scheming warmonger in what feels like the real blockbuster sequel to Steven Spielbergs Jurassic Park rather than the two muddled follow-ups from 1997 and 2001.Article Continued BelowJurassic World vigorously addresses the issues of messing with nature and commoditizing wonder that were raised by Spielbergs 1993 adaptation of Michael Crichtons bestselling novel. But its a film more of thrills than thoughts and nothing can top the unforgettable ""wow"" of the first viewing of groundbreaking digital dinosaurs in the original trip to the park.The tourists (and the danger) return to Jurassic Park in Jurassic World.The new movie is set 22 years after the deadly antics of Jurassic Park and in the same fictional Isla Nublar reserve near Costa Rica. The new billionaire owner (Irrfan Khan) of the late John Hammonds dinosaur DNA hatchery and theme park is now packing in more than 20000 people per day who are willing to spend top dollar -- including 7 (U.S.) for a bottle of Coca-Cola -- to watch prehistoric beasties act like modern trained animals.How quickly people forget catastrophe when theres money to be made. But profits have dipped slightly because gum-chewing gawkers are growing jaded of the Jurassic.""Nobodys impressed by a dinosaur anymore"" says officious park manager Claire (Dallas Howard) who incongruously struts around the jungle in fashionable duds and high heels.The solution? Design a scarier dino a task eagerly taken up by the parks conscience-free top geneticist Henry Wu (BD Wong) the films sole holdover from the Hammond era. Sparing no expense (although were told it added up to 26 million) hes hatched up a paler but more lethal version of the T. rex a hybrid called ""Indominus rex"" that has never previously stalked the Earth.Who knows what havoc this thing might cause were it to escape from its enclosure designed by ""the best structural engineers in the world""?Insert sardonic laughter here along with the ominous score by Michael Giacchino which samples John Williams memorable original theme.The popcorn-chewing adventure takes full visual advantage of 22 years of CGI advancements although it doesnt go in for modern gore or horror. Theres never a moment in Jurassic World where the blood really flows but the sense of terror is equally constrained. Director Colin Trevorrow pays all due tribute to Spielberg - and that includes Jaws as well Jurassic Park - but its like watching a students respectful imitation rather than a teachers masterful archetype. New to blockbusters Trevorrow is better with characters than action scenes as anyone who saw his charming sci-fi indie Safety Not Guaranteed might attest. Yet even here he strays from his comfort zone by failing to take full advantage of Pratts flair for comic heroism.Pratts ex-Navy character Owen is more of a straight-ahead swashbuckler type a nature lover who has learned to communicate with raptors - if not to entirely tame them. His assistant played by Omar Sy is little more than a caricature.Owens work draws unwelcome attention from Vincent DOnofrios park security chief Hoskins who dreams of militarizing the raptors. He muses about sending these brilliantly lethal hunters to fight in Afghanistan.Seems odd a guy as smart as Owen would be unaware that the Indominus rex project is happening right under his nose. Jurassic World is full of such eye-rolling constructs the likely cause being that Trevorrow co-wrote the bulging screenplay with three other writers just one scribe less than the total of five who penned all three previous Jurassic Park movies.Jurassic World nevertheless hits all the expected beats of heroism action and dinosaur dining. The tourists are delicious and there are so many more to snack on this timeOwen might be underwritten and humor-deficient but who are you gonna call when two reckless teens (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) get lost in Jurassic World just as their neglectful Aunt Claire is losing all control of the place?Its also cool how aspects of Jurassic Park tie into this one including an unlikely redemption scenario that unfolds grandly. (Among the films many amusing grace notes fans of TVs Orange Is the New Black will smile at an exchange between computer specialists played by Lauren Lapkus and Jake Johnson.)If it all somehow feels like dino deja vu then you might sympathize with Claire never at a loss for words who accurately sums up what Jurassic World really needs ""More teeth.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

VPCBryce Dallas Howard Chris Pratt Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins fend off terrifying dinos in Jurassic World.(Photo Universal Pictures)Its hard to suppress a big stupid grin watching Chris Pratt zip through the jungle on a motorcycle with his A-team of Velociraptors.The computer-generated dinosaurs of Jurassic World (   out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday) are just as cool as they were 22 years ago in Jurassic Park -- but it takes the equivalent of a Stone Age to actually get to the exciting parts in this fourth installment in Steven Spielbergs giant-reptile franchise. World is a monster step up from the two disappointing previous sequels but is sorely missing the heart and inherent wonder of the classic first film.USA TODAYHeres what Chris Pratt will sacrificeThat memorable and sweeping John Williams music kicks in early when a pair of young boys (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) arrive at the Jurassic World theme park in Isla Nublar yet the same feeling of majesty isnt there. Holograms and state-of-the-art facilities only go so far when people are hungry to see cloned dinos.The kids aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the parks operations manager and shes feeling the pressure to step it up too. With attendance stagnating she plans to get more butts in seats with the introduction of Indominus rex the first genetically modified hybrid whos ""bigger better and louder"" than the Tyrannosaurus rex that wrecked the first Jurassic Park.USA TODAYA visitors guide to Jurassic World dinosaursA behavioral researcher from the Navy Owen Grady (Pratt) is seemingly the only person who thinks the Indominus is kind of a bad idea and his worst fears are met when she gets loose and starts tearing up the joint putting 20000 park visitors in harms way.Pratt is again another roguish action hero though this ones much more lacking in that mold than his Guardians of the Galaxy character. Howard is the requisite love interest the Leia to his Han but Pratt winds up having better chemistry with Owens raptor posse.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare USA TODAYs Carly Mallenbaum tries to find out what went into the creation of the dinosaurs in the new Jurassic World during the films premiere in Hollywood. Robert Hanashiro USA TODAYThats less a slam on the humans and more a testament to how top-notch the dinos are. Jurassic Park blew moviegoers minds with its special effects yet director Colin Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed) has crafted a zoo of phenomenal creations that rivals the originals impressive array of ancient animals.A sequence where winged Pteranodons and Dimorphodons fly through crowds in the parks central hub showcases actual human danger much better than San Andreas or even Avengers. Yet on the whole in the film the creatures are so realistic that you feel more for the dinos than the people. Its worrisome when little baby Triceratops in the petting zoo get caught in the chaos and theres one seriously heartbreaking scene with a dying Brontosaurus.Youngsters whove got their T. rex toys already may find a few of the more harrowing Jurassic World scenes too scary. The first Jurassic Park is a good litmus test for the fright factor If kids get through that without ending up behind the couch they might be OK with the new movie.USA TODAYJurassic World taps into real-world greed Jurassic Park is for a certain generation of children what Star Wars was to the previous one and theres definitely nostalgia for the original film in Jurassic World Jake Johnsons character Lowery is a control-room nerd who acts as comic relief as well as an audience surrogate clad in a vintage Jurassic Park T-shirt and parked at a work station covered with plastic dinos.Trevorrow proves his mettle as a up-and-coming blockbuster director especially in the films climax a nasty affair featuring a battle royale of dino species that leaves even the on-screen characters slackjawed.Claire points out early on that ""no ones impressed by a dinosaur anymore"" -- a line that seems true of the real world too -- but Jurassic World gives us enough dino-mite action to stave off excitement extinction.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShareJURASSIC WORLD HOPES TO BE T-REX OF SUMMER MOVIESJurassic World The franchise by the numbers | 207June 12 -- ""Jurassic World"" is set to make a big debut in the weekend box office.

The films frankenscript -- cobbled together by four different writers -- closely follows the formula laid out by the original ""Jurassic Park"" sweeping shots of landscape and dino porn a self-sure and essentially kind leader a couple of terrified/brave kids order crumbling into chaos.But the sense of wonder is missing and everyone audience included just seems to be going through the standard summer movie motions. Yes those are some really big dinosaurs up there on the screen. Yawn. Has anyone seen the Hulk lately? Hed be fun in a dinosaur movie.Alas he must not have been available. Instead were given Chris Pratt who does his best with the over-worn surroundings even if his trademark sense of humor is somewhat suppressed. Yin to his yang uptight to his casual delicate to his brawn is Bryce Dallas Howard a woman so steely she keeps her high heels on even when running for her life.Howard plays Claire the chief administrator of ""Jurassic World"" now a thriving island theme park some 20 years after the tumult of ""Jurassic Park"" (the franchises other two sequels seem just as in real life forgotten). The park is as stuffed with tourists as Disneyland key among them being Claires nephews young Gray (Ty Simpkins) and teen Zach (Nick Robinson).Claire hasnt seen the boys in seven years and she doesnt see much of them after they arrive either. The parks billionaire owner (Irrfan Khan) has landed and wants to see his latest investment. Amusement parks need to keep offering new attractions so scientists have spliced together all sorts of dinosaur genes and come up with a super-colossal new breed. What a great idea. How could anything go wrong?Meanwhile a former Navy man Owen (Pratt) has been working on training dangerous velociraptors (who knew the Navy had a dinosaur-training program?). An obnoxious fellow named Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) who may as well have Bad Guy tattooed on his forehead wants to use the raptors as soldiers. Another great idea.Theres also a Sea World-like attraction a gargantuan mega-whale living in a man-made lake. It swallows large sharks whole for the amusement of the crowds. Sooo many good ideas in one place.Anyway the obvious happens. The super-colossal hybrid breaks free and starts eating people. It chases the boys it chases Owen and Claire it murders peaceful dinosaurs just for the fun of it. Tourists panic other dinosaurs run wild movie mayhem ensues.The bold-faced theme -- science has run amok dont mess with mother nature -- mirrors ""Jurassic Park"" (and so many other modern films even as science continues to run amok) without expanding on it. ""Park"" director Steven Spielberg executive-produced this film and his sensibility is all over ""World"" director Colin Trevorrows work; unfortunately that sensibility is now decades old and that which was once fresh and amazing feels commonplace and overly tired.Look ""Jurassic World"" still delivers big dumb cheap summer thrills. But extinction may be the kindest thing that can happen to this franchise.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongJurassic WorldGRADE CRated PG-13 for intense sequences of science-fiction violence and perilRunning time 124 minutes 55 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 12 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1S8oCk5 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/06/11/movie-review-jurassic-world-offers-familiar-storyline/71079514/,200,jurassicworld16,jurassicworld,detroitnews

(Early warning sign the swelling triumphant music played over the big reveal of...a theme park. Later warning sign the lengthy faintly sadistic death scene of an extremely minor character. Why?) There is this bit of cleverness a pointed indictment of the audiences constant insatiable desire for ""bigger teeth"" -- even as thats exactly whats served up.

Updated July 30 2016  610 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Jurassic World is a fun familiar thrill ride By Joe Williams / film critic / joewilliamspost-dispatch.com Joe Williams Jun 11 2015 (...) If Hollywood were to hatch a Spielbergian blockbuster in a genetics lab it might look a lot like ""Jurassic World.""When the bean counters at the titular theme park say the public wants bigger thrills its no coincidence that they sound like movie executives. So the ill-fated dinosaur preserve of the 1993 film has grown into a thriving tourist attraction that conspicuously resembles Universal Studios. But whereas the latter has a ""Jaws"" attraction Jurassic World feeds great white sharks to a sea monster the size of a battleship. With its hordes of tourists cheerful guides and name-brand vendors the island paradise is ripe for 3-D destruction.Maybe someday a summer spectacular will revolve around say an elderly Hispanic couple but here the imperiled protagonists are typical suburban boys girl-obsessed Zach (Nick Robinson) and dinosaur-obsessed younger brother Gray (Ty Simpkins) who are visiting aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) while their parents (Judy Greer and Andy Buckley) contemplate divorce in Anyone USA. Claire is an overstressed executive at the theme park and from the control room she keeps a wary eye on the restricted zone at the north end of the island. Thats where a lab-created super dinosaur is starting to rumble before it can be trained to do tricks for the tourists. Park owner Masrani (Irrfan Khan) the eighth richest man on the planet hopes the new Indominus Rex will boost attendance while fiendish underling Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) hopes the monster can be repurposed as a war machine.Not so fast says our hero Navy veteran and dinosaur wrangler Owen (Chris Pratt just slightly more serious than in ""Guardians of the Galaxy""). He knows that regenerated reptiles cannot be completely tamed and a hybrid creature thats part raptor and part Rex is a recipe for ... well you can guess the rest.Yet theres pleasure in the predictability. For his second feature film director Colin Trevorrow (""Safety Not Guaranteed"") has cloned the spine of a Spielberg movie and draped it with familiar flourishes oblivious children playing with toys growling dinosaurs sniffing out victims slack-jawed characters stepping toward display screens and plate-glass window to behold what meddlesome mankind has wrought. And unobtrusive nods are made to other yesteryear films from a ""Butch Cassidy""-style canyon jump to a ""Birds""-style attack by pterodactyls.Although theres a regrettable shortage of sympathetic characters Jake Johnson is a standout as the obligatory control-room oddball. And Howard gets to go harrumph and stamp her feet like Kate Capshaw when ex-beau Owen questions her mettle. No its not as inventive as the first ""Jurassic Park"" and considering what the dinosaurs did to San Diego in episode 2 the failure of these fools to plan for emergencies is a potential deal breaker. But even without world-class smarts or amusing mutations the next generation of ""Jurassic"" is an enjoyable ride.What ""Jurassic World""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 204 Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Chris Pratt evolves into leading man in Jurassic World UNIVERSAL CITY Calif.

Chuck Zlotnick AP Universal Pictures Universal Pictures AP Jurassic World     (out of five) Director Colin Trevorrow Cast Chris Pratt Bryce Dallas Howard Rated PG-13 (intense sequences of science-fiction violence and peril) Running time 124 min. Related links Chris Pratt evolves into leading man in Jurassic World By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 400pm on Wednesday Jun. 10 2015 Wednesday Jun. 10 2015 Monday Jun. 15 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram There are two questions everyone is going to have after seeing Jurassic World the fourth installment in the story of the ill-fated amusement park where dinosaurs are brought roaring back to life. Considering the places blood-spattered track record what insurance company and/or government would let this place operate? And who in their right mind would go?But its best not to be concerned about such practicalities during Jurassic World a mixed bag of a movie that only really comes alive when the dinos are brawling with each other or snacking on humans like its lunchtime at Whataburger. Because its at these moments -- and there are a lot of them -- that the audience will be most thankful for lax regulations and gullible patrons.Set 22 years after the horrific events of Jurassic Park -- in which the Central American tropical island of Nublar is turned into a theme park showcasing reconstituted dinosaurs -- Jurassic World starts off looking a bit like Tomorrowland. The park is now a shiny sprawling tourist mecca full of compliant dinosaurs and it seems no more dangerous than a petting zoo.Overseeing it is Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) a bureaucratic corporate functionary who refers to the animals as ""assets"" and is mandated to implement the vision of CEO Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) and Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) the scientist responsible for this new generation of dinosaurs and a holdover from Jurassic Park. Desperate to keep attendance levels up they want attractions with ""more teeth"" -- literally and metaphorically -- to keep audiences interested. Its not enough just to have a dinosaur these days; they need one thats going to get people talking. Its profits before paleontology.They think theyve struck gold with Indominus Rex a giant lethal combo of genetically modified teeth and claws cooked up by Dr. Wu in his lab. The problem is that they cant keep this new creature contained -- big surprise -- and it starts rampaging across the island.Of course this just happens to be the day that Claires nephews -- sullen teen Zach (Nick Robinson The Kings of Summer) and dino-crazy younger brother Gray (Ty Simpkins Iron Man 3) -- are visiting. And when boo-hiss bad guy Vic Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) who wants to use raptors in the armed forces is making his power play.The only one who can save them is Owen (Chris Pratt) a dinosaur lover and Jurassic World trainer who along with his assistant Barry (Omar Sy X-Men Days of Future Past) has been working with the raptors getting them to obey some basic commands. But even he has his beefy hands full when going up against ol Indominus. (Though despite the dinosaur apocalypse theres enough time for sparks to reignite between Owen and Claire.)In his first big-budget project director Colin Trevorrow -- best known for the indie Safety Not Guaranteed -- has made an efficient film that relies on the dinosaurs for its distinction. There are some showstopping sequences like the impressive flying pterosaur attack that sends crowds screaming for cover.Though when theyre not screaming the humans in Jurassic World are lifeless and featureless as is much of the humor. The give-and-take between Claire and Owen -- which has sparked some online uproar about sexism after the trailers hit the Net -- is flat. If its supposed to be a sendup of traditional hero roles it misses the mark.But nobody goes to a movie like this for a treatise on male-female relationships while Pratt proves to be capable of being the jut-jawed hero who can take on the fiercest monsters CGI can muster.Yet for those who remember both the sheer terror and humor of Steven Spielbergs original Jurassic Park Jurassic World -- much like the dinosaurs these scientists create -- proves once again that some things are best left alone.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Among all the delights in Steven Spielbergs ""Jurassic Park"" movies -- clever characters miraculous special effects gorgeously choreographed chase sequences -- the greatest guilty pleasure was the return to horror movie basics. When the monsters attacked people on-screen shrieked as did the audiences. The series revival ""Jurassic World"" which Spielberg executive-produced embraces that principle and expands it. It may not equal the humor and inventiveness of the original film but death has never been so much fun. While ""Jurassic World"" picks up from where ""Jurassic Park III"" left off in 2001 it is neither a reboot nor an adaptation. Its a friendly innovative salute to the esteemed originals. Director Colin Trevorrow returns us to the luxurious island/dinosaur theme park of Isla Nublar with the zeal of a freaked-out fan. This is only his second feature after ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" a charming indie with a highly individual sense of humor. What a relief to follow sequence after sequence where Trevorrow copies the brush strokes of the Spielberg masterpieces. His film abounds with references to key scenes from the 1993 beginner of the series and unexpected outrageous salutes to ""Jaws"" as well. Also a very aggressive flock of pterodactyls that peck the heads of their human breakfasts like bloodthirsty Woody Woodpeckers. The plot is bold intelligent and simple. The owners of the Pacific island invent Indominus Rex a new breed of giant super dinosaur to draw more corporate sponsors and vacationers. A wrangler does behavioral research on the smaller faster raptors to see if humans can tame those intelligent creatures. ""Good"" dinosaurs combat ""bad"" ones when either side isnt battling weaponized homo sapiens. Or the annoying tourists. When they do liquid the color of ketchup hits the screen by the gallons. The Jurassic corporations bad dino redesign is defended by Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) a tense type-A manager. The stylish business-minded career woman has a fractious connection to her mainland sister Karen (Judy Greer). Like all Spielberg films this is extremely sentimental about the importance of family. Karen has guilted Claire into baby-sitting her boys as they visit the island on their own for a week. Why anyone would deport her boys to Costa Rica on vacation gets a logical if not entirely likely answer. Universal Pictures Bryce Dallas Howard Chris Pratt Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins in ""Jurassic World."" Chris Pratt appears in fighting trim as Owen a Navy veteran who is the teams dinosaur whisperer. He lives in retro mountain-man style with an Airstream trailer far out in the forest supplied with husky man field gear no back story and surprisingly few laughs. The usually comedic Pratt goes full action guy here as if Spielberg is prepping him for the next Indiana Jones movies. Owen and Claire arent romantically connected at least not until they locate her nephews amid a crowd of 20000 stampeding tourists. Here Howard gets more laughs than Pratt transforming into an honorary guy who can exterminate dinosaurs by machine gun and outrun them in stiletto heels. Because Spielberg films always need a villainous presence Vincent DOnofrio plays Hoskins a military consultant with an agenda of his own. Seeing a zillion-dollar franchise film by a newcomer often makes you feel like youre about to inspect the damage at a travesty. But once in a while its a fans love feast like Lady Gaga performing ""The Sound of Music"" at the Oscars or singing duets with Tony Bennett. The tenderfoot isnt trying to transform classics with an odd new perspective but to dust off the thrilling tricks that worked way back when. The film delivers the basics in new forms that are respectful and exciting. colin.covertstartribune.com ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"Jurassic World (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Jurassic World (PG-13) The dinosaurs are everywhere but fun is scarce in this disappointing unimaginative sequel. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/11/2015 Editor rating 1 Jurassic World opens on a promising unexpected note. Decades after the dream of billionaire John Hammond to open a dinosaur theme park was dashed by some uncooperative velociraptors and a grumpy T. rex in Steven Spielbergs Jurassic Park the vision has come to fruition. Dinoland has been open for business for several years now in Costa Rica but attendance has started to wane because once youve seen one triceratops youve seen them all. New attractions are needed to keep the tourists coming. These days wonder has a short shelf life. So when Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) the workaholic park manager obsessed with profit margins announces to her staff at the start of the film that ""No ones impressed by a dinosaur anymore. They need to be bigger louder and with more teeth"" you wonder if director Colin Trevorrow has dared to pull a Charlie Kaufman. Will Jurassic World be a meta-movie that doubles as a commentary on Hollywoods obsession to keep making sequels bigger louder and with more teeth? Your hopes are strengthened by a subsequent scene in which one of the park employees is admonished for wearing a Jurassic Park T-shirt to work even though he paid 150 for it on eBay because horrible things happened at Jurassic Park and we shouldnt exploit tragedy with memorabilia. Cut to a petting zoo attraction in which loving families pet adorable dinosaurs as if they were goats. Add the fact you know things are going to go bad soon and Jurassic World seems poised to break brave new ground as a subversive blockbuster about corporate greed even though its a third sequel which cost 180 million. That to me would be more amazing than watching two sauropods trying to sink three-pointers on a basketball court. But forget all that. Like Hammonds original vision Jurassic World quickly implodes as soon as the plot kicks in. Chris Pratt shows up as a Raptor Whisperer who dresses as if he were planning to walk over to the Indiana Jones reboot next door as soon as filming is over for the day and collect his next paycheck. He plays an ex-military free spirit a mans man who doesnt believe in deodorant and his romantic quips with Howard are so astonishingly bad (""You wanna consult here ..."" he asks her flirtatiously ""or in my bungalow?"") I kept waiting for the laugh track to kick in or at least the Love American Style opening credits to flash on the screen. Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins play brothers who fill the requisite kids-in-peril duty while BD Wong (who also appeared in Jurassic Park) returns as the secretive geneticist who has followed his boss orders and engineered a new kind of dinosaur a blend of T. rex and ... something (dun dun dun). Even though practically all the adult characters onscreen are supposed to be borderline geniuses -- or at least have basic zoo keeping skills -- the parks new attraction named Indominus rex (which sounds suspiciously like a rejected moniker from Mad Max Fury Road) gets loose which leads to further accidents and more critters running amok in the packed park. Things get so crazy Claires modified bob gets messed up and she even tears her skirt. Also the companies that paid for product placement in the film -- Starbucks Samsung Jimmy Buffetts Margaritaville restaurant chain -- each gets a shot of a dinosaur wrecking their establishment. Curiously though the body count remains low. Considering the great potential for mass deaths and maimings -- imagine a pack of prehistoric carnivores eating their way through the Magic Kingdom -- only a few people die almost all of them villains (or characters who are at least a little shady). How could a movie with such a fun premise turn out this dull? Youve already seen the best shot in the film -- that mosasaur jumping out of the water to eat a shark in front of an adoring crowd -- and although the special effects are impressive theres no sense of awe or discovery to any of them because we can now play video games that look as good as this movie and Trevorrow doesnt have much visual imagination (his previous film the tiny sci-fi charmer Safety Not Guaranteed seems like an odd calling card for such a large follow-up). There is exactly one clever image in the entire movie a close-up of a claw thudding down on the ground with a loud whomp until the camera pulls back to reveal it belongs to a pigeon. The rest of the film is just generic Industrial Light amp; Magic spectacle. Jurassic World was written by some smart people (Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver are working on the next two Avatar pictures for James Cameron and Derek Connolly co-wrote Safety Not Guaranteed with Trevorrow). Occasionally they pull off a clever exchange In a small part as a park employee Lauren Lapkus almost steals the movie outright with one funny throwaway line the only time I can remember laughing intentionally instead of at the film. But much of the dialogue in Jurassic World consists of tripe such as ""I was with the Navy not the Navajo"" or ""Youll last two minutes in there Less with those ridiculous shoes"" Vincent DOnofrio fares worst of all as the military industrialist who wants to weaponize velociraptors The movie devotes at least 10 minutes to him laying out his nefarious scheme even though the subplot is so obvious he could have mimed his character and we would have gleaned all we needed to know. Ive read some critics defending Jurassic World as being an example of Hollywood simply giving people what they want Nonstop dino carnage done with the best special effects money can buy. Whats not to like right? But why couldnt it be a better movie? No one expects deep characterizations or Meryl Streep to show up in the cast of a Jurassic Park movie (although how cool would that be if she did?) but at least in the first film Spielberg put on such a jaw-dropping spectacle of showmanship he fired up your love of pure moviemaking with that initial T. rex attack alone. Jurassic World gives you exactly what Howards character promises at the beginning -- More Bigger Faster -- but you know theres something deeply wrong with a film that expects you to shed tears over digitally created prehistoric creatures and rubber brontosaurus heads instead of rooting for you know people.

Screenwriters Rick Jaffa Amanda Silver Derek Connolly Colin Trevorrow. A Universal Pictures release. Running time 124 minutes. Brief vulgar language scary dinosaur attacks gore.

EntertainmentMovies Jurassic World The franchise isnt (quite) extinct yet Originally published June 11 2015 at 1205 am Updated June 11 2015 at 1203 pm The latest installment in the dinosaur-disaster series stars charming Chris Pratt in a preposterous and entertaining story. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic ""These people they never learn"" murmurs a minor character in ""Jurassic World"" and if Id had a glass Id have raised it. The silly but irresistible fourth film in Steven Spielbergs T-rex-sized dinosaur franchise directed this time around by Colin Trevorrow (whose first film was the made-in-Seattle ""Safety Not Guaranteed"") ""Jurassic World"" would have us believe that a crew of very rich and (theoretically) very smart people would build an entire massive theme park around the experience of interacting with actual dinosaurs -- and that the dinosaurs wont hurt anyone because well they just wont. Except for that one time. Or maybe more than once. Anyway it wont happen ever again Pass the money So here we are in Jurassic World a luxury island resort complete with Starbucks Ben amp; Jerrys and something called Jurassic Tennis and nobodys supposed to talk about that time or three back then when unpleasant things happened. Particularly Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard in a sharp-edged Anna Wintour haircut) the operations manager who refers to the complexs newly gene-spliced and super-dangerous dinosaur as ""it"" (everyone else respectfully calls the creature ""she""). Claires too busy career-ing to hang with her adorable visiting nephews (Ty Simpkins Nick Robinson) and is so uptight that she resists the charms of Owen (Chris Pratt) the parks resident dinosaur whisperer and Hot Dude Who Dresses Vaguely Like Indiana Jones. (The Spielberg allusions are numerous; note also a shark cameo and a cuddly petting-zoo dinosaur whos a dead ringer for E.T.) You can fill in the script from here Dinosaurs escape cute nephews are in peril various people get munched Claires uptightness eventually melts (and her severe haircut turns curly). But while this film never quite evokes the awe a lot of us remember from watching the original ""Jurassic Park"" it still looks scarily impressive. Flying dinosaurs recall ""The Birds"" on steroids; velociraptors prance menacingly; and the biggest new dino -- Indominus rex so were told -- demonstrates an alarming habit of sneaking up on her prey terrorizing them with one massive eye. Shes also pretty smart; well smarter than Claire which admittedly isnt the highest bar. (Fashion/survival tip for Claire or anyone When chased by dinosaur kick high heels off.) Movie Review 1/2   Jurassic World with Chris Pratt Bryce Dallas Howard Vincent DOnofrio Ty Simpkins Nick Robinson Jake Johnson Omar Sy BD Wong Judy Greer Irrfan Khan. Directed by Colin Trevorrow from a screenplay by Rick Jaffa Amanda Silver Derek Connolly and Trevorrow based on characters created by Michael Crichton. 124 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of science-fiction violence and peril. Several theaters. Pratt though he spends much of his screen time staring very intently at the raptors (his relationship with the creatures as Owen explains to Claire is based on ""mutual respect"") is his usual appealing self here and he and the CGI crew make the film good popcorn fun. See ""Jurassic World"" on the biggest screen you can find (for the record I saw it in IMAX 3D at Pacific Science Center) tune out the screenplay enjoy the silly chase scenes and swooping camera work and wonder if this franchise has finally reached its end. As this summers disaster movies blur together in my head I find myself hoping that The Rock might drop by the resort next time to wrestle a T-rex or two and maybe create a messy love triangle with Owen and Claire.

Colin Trevorrow directs the epic action-adventure from a screenplay he wrote with Derek Connolly. (Universal Pictures) By Ann Hornaday June 10 2015 Follow AnnHornaday Jurassic World"" the third sequel to 1993s classic fantasy-adventure ""Jurassic Park"" gets off to an imaginative start. After an opening sequence of clawed amber-eyed creatures poking through crackling egg shells we see an entire taloned leg stomp down only to have the camera reveal that it belongs to a common bird. Moments later a bickering mom and dad are sending their two sons to visit their aunt Claire who oversees the operations of Jurassic World a luxury resort and theme park that has been in operation for more than a decade inviting visitors to get up close and personal with triceratopses T. rexes Apatosauri pterodactyls and other genetically resuscitated prehistoric creatures. ""Remember if something chases you run"" the boys mother laughs sending them off. [2015 Summer Movie Guide] Sure its all lighthearted foreshadowing until the first fat security guard gets chomped which happens in due course in ""Jurassic World"" a super-size self-referential drastically uneven addition to the Steven Spielberg franchise. When the kids finally get to Isla Nublar the younger dino-obsessed Gray (Ty Simpkins) is dazzled; Zach (Nick Robinson) can barely tear himself away from his cellphone. Once at the sprawling self-contained theme resort they are put in the care of a similarly multi-tasking administrative aide who leads them with casual indifference past sights that would have taken her breath away just 14 years ago when the most recent ""Jurassic Park"" sequel came out. (This movie however takes place in a world where the two intervening movies do not exist.) Aunt Claire -- played by Bryce Dallas Howard -- is just as blase She only cares about increasing attendance numbers. ""No ones impressed by a dinosaur anymore"" she explains to potential corporate sponsors at one point. ""Consumers want them bigger louder -- more teeth."" Of course this is a meta-commentary on the movie industry itself and a clever way to manage audience expectations. Were going to give it to you the filmmakers seem to be saying but dont blame us if it all goes kerblooey in a nonsensical hyperbolic Grand Guignol of CGI mayhem and overkill. Which ""Jurassic World"" does but not before it engages in some cursory character development and promiscuous product placement which ranges from conspicuous shots of Coke bottles and Imax insignias to a faintly amusing cameo from Jimmy Fallon. [A field guide to the very familiar characters in ""Jurassic World""] The main attraction in ""Jurassic World"" which was co-written and directed by Sundance discovery Colin Trevorrow is the Dr. Moreau-vian creature that the parks scientists have cooked up to ""up the wow factor"" with visitors a massive albino hybrid called Indominus rex that is so potentially lethal that theyve kept her in a paddock all her own. When things go awry career-gal Claires corporate savvy cant help her nor can the philosophical pronouncements of the parks billionaire owner (Irrfan Khan). The only man for the job is a rumpled dimpled animal behaviorist named Owen who has been working with a team of voracious Velociraptors to see if they can be trained. Surrounded by unethical dumbbells who either want to domesticate dinosaurs or commodify or weaponize them Owen is the only one who seeks to understand them. The dynamic between the earthy authentic Owen and the brittle dumb-bunny Claire is meant to harken back to such vintage romantic adventures as ""Romancing the Stone"" and the Indiana Jones movies. But way too much gets lost in translation here The dim selfish Claire is as charmless as she is clueless and her scenes -- in which she gets progressively more tousled and scantily attired -- are a painful pastiche of sexist tropes. As Owen Chris Pratt focuses more on smoldering and looking earnest than calling on the witty persona from ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" a big waste of his natural gifts. The most enjoyable moments of an otherwise oddly joyless film actually belong to Jake Johnson and Lauren Lapkus who steal the show in an especially amusing scene during a panicked evacuation. The set pieces admittedly are impressive especially when the benighted Indominus stomps her way to freedom crushing impaling and of course eating everything in her path (except the stars natch). Later Trevorrow stages a large-scale homage to Alfred Hitchcock when the park is attacked by swarming pterodactyls. In one of ""Jurassic Worlds"" several references to its own DNA Zach and Gray stumble upon the vine-encrusted SUVs and dusty equipment of John Hammonds doomed park from way back in 93 a nod toward Hollywoods constant self-cannibalization and reflexive need to build bigger more spectacular edifices on the crumbling ruins of its own past. Anyone who knows about the role of Darwinian ethics and hubris in the Jurassic canon will understand why ambition doesnt come in particularly handy in ""Jurassic World."" Nor do the killer instincts of Owens raptors -- once the villains of the piece now poised for their moment of redemption. The promised bigness loudness and ""more teeth"" finally arrive during the films chaotic final half hour when a dilemma is resolved by what can only be described as a dino ex machina Howard goes from Kathleen Turner into full Fay Wray and the viewers only recourse is to brace oneself and try to process the ever-escalating utterly nonsensical madness and mayhem. As has been previously observed every action movie today ends up as ""Transformers"" and even when its cloned creatures fighting the same is true here (with an antic dash of ""Sharknado"" tossed in for good measure). Its not ambition or technical know-how or even plucky resourcefulness that save the day in ""Jurassic World"" its good old-fashioned anthropomorphism. Humans it seems never learn. But if we did where would sequels come from? PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense sequences of science fiction violence and peril and brief profanity. 124 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Photo Credit Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The dinosaur revival park is back and so is the death toll. (Rating PG-13 (action violence brief gore)a"" BOTTOM LINE A satisfying roller coaster ride even if it feels like the 1993 original. CAST Chris Pratt Bryce Dallas Howard Ty Simpkins LENGTH 204 The fictional Jurassic Park is back in business updated into an even bigger and slicker resort that gives its name to ""Jurassic World."" Despite countless casualties racked up over three films the park has cooked up a new attraction a man-made beast called the Indominus rex. ""Nobodys impressed by a dinosaur anymore"" says Claire a Jurassic executive played by a chilly Bryce Dallas Howard. ""Consumers want them bigger louder. More teeth."" Shes talking about you moviegoers and ""Jurassic World"" will certainly give you your moneys worth. Its a beat-for-beat repeat of Steven Spielbergs 1993 smash ""Jurassic Park"" but with smoother effects and niftier gadgetry (and more product placement). That turns out to be a calculated but winning formula. Directed almost as an homage by Colin Trevorrow ""Jurassic World"" is a new and thrilling roller coaster built on familiar territory. advertisement | advertise on newsday The basics havent changed. Were still following two kids excitable young Gray (Ty Simpkins) and his too-cool teenage brother Zach (Nick Robinson) who have been sent to the park alone by their weepy mom (Judy Greer). The boys aunt is Claire but shes too busy climbing the corporate ladder -- and flirting with raptor trainer Owen (Chris Pratt) -- to watch them. When the Indominus rex busts out of its concrete bunker the boys are MIA. There isnt much chemistry between Claire who can be shockingly heartless and Owen who mostly glowers. Pratt the insouciant charmer from last years ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" seems a bit wasted in this humorless role; theres far more appeal to Lowery (Jake Johnson) a tech-savvy nebbish with a dormant heroic streak. Vincent DOnofrio has fun playing Hoskins a scheming military contractor with plans for those raptors. Remember in 1993 when the dinosaur played cat and mouse with two kids in a Ford Explorer? Here the kids are trapped in a spherical gyro-pod but the idea is the same. Other repeated scenes include the raptors wreaking havoc the parks owner Mr. Masrani (Irrfan Khan) watching his empire crumble and a climactic battle of Godzilla-like magnitude -- and thats just a short list. There isnt anything original here but its all executed with energy and skill. As always the underlying message is that nature like Hollywood formulas should not be tampered with.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet ""No ones impressed with dinosaurs anymore"" says harried middle manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) on what will quickly prove to be the most stressful disastrous day of her life. Claires talking about Jurassic World the fully functioning dino-exhibiting amusement park she runs and how the waning awe of attendees has forced the owners to cook up some bold (a.k.a. foolishly dangerous) new attractions. But she could also be talking in a fourth-wall-breaching sort of way about the very movie in which shes unwittingly starring. Maybe dinosaurs arent enough to satiate audiences anymore. Maybe some 22 years after Steven Spielberg brought those mighty animals back to life what we really demand is dinosaurs crossed with other dinosaurs.Jurassic World a goofy and fitfully entertaining summer movie understands and even winks at its place in the pecking order of blockbuster sequels. Like its predecessors its been engineered to up the audience-courting ante. Whats scarier than a Tyrannosaurs rex? The Lost World Jurassic Park Spielbergs own (underrated) sequel doubled down on the rex unleashing not one but two of the hungry behemoths. And in Jurassic Park III the big guy was replaced by an even larger faster and meaner alpha predator. Jurassic World goes further into the realm of genetic modification and emerges with a deadly new designer species--a pale-white lab experiment gone wrong a not-so-gentle giant with camouflage flesh and a keen intellect. Its a ridiculous direction for the series to take but at least the filmmakers exhibit some self-awareness As a comic-relief control room jockey New Girls Jake Johnson gets to sport an original JP T-shirt and make nostalgic cracks about how the first Jurassic Park (the place itself wink wink) didnt have to create genetic hybrids to sell tickets.What the films four credited screenwriters also understand is that part of the appeal of Michael Crichtons original premise reconfigured from his earlier Westworld was the sight of a corporate vacation destination gone horribly wrong. Putting the park back into Jurassic Park this fourth entry is never more fun than when crosscutting around its island setting and watching as various employees run damage control after their absurdly vicious creation--Indominus rex a name even the films characters mock--escapes captivity. Under pressure from her mogul boss (Irrfan Khan heir to the throne of Richard Attenborough) Howards heroine attempts to contain the threat without evacuating the park. Guess how well that goes? The trouble isnt all dino-related InGen the Weyland-Yutani of the Jurassic Park universe wants to weaponize the Velociraptors with an oily Vincent DOnofrio on site to make the corrupt case. Guess how well that goes?Speaking of raptors natures finest killing machines just keep getting smarter. Theyve now learned to take commands but only from someone with the right dino-whispering moves. Enter Owen Grady a sarcastic motorcycle-riding maverick trainer played by Hollywoods hunky funnyman of the moment Chris Pratt. Owens something of a hybrid himself infused with the dismissive snark of Jeff Goldblum and the great-white-hunter gravity of the originals Muldoon with a dash of Indiana Jones added for good measure. Hes great as a voice of reason less so as a love interest Howard in the fairly thankless leading role of an uptight workaholic spends most of the movie getting put in her place by her studly costar; its no real wonder sparks dont fly between them. Still this retrograde Romancing The Stone subplot is much preferable to scenes of Claires nephews teenage Zach (Nick Robinson) and preteen Gray (Ty Simpkins) getting some brotherly bonding in while trying not to be eaten. Theyre no Lex and Tim.Much more than the other sequels Jurassic World recalls the original working in some of the iconic locales of its iconic predecessor and leaning hard on that rousing John Williams theme. And yet director Colin Trevorrow making the leap to the big-budget big leagues after Safety Not Guaranteed cant match the more tactile thrills of Spielbergs seminal summer movie. Trevorrows set pieces--a dive-bombing flock of pterodactyls; a supremely ridiculous but crowd-pleasing climax--are lively but never remotely terrifying. The film desperately wants for the danger the white-knuckle excitement of raptors in the kitchen or T. rex in the rain. For all its winking callbacks Jurassic World is a modern blockbuster through and through While the first Park skillfully mixed and matched animatronics with CGI resulting in what still feels like the ultimate special-effects movie this expensive retread seems content placing its flesh-and-blood stars against a rotating green screen of digital attractions. Technological advances aside it looks much faker than its ancient ancestor. As Pratt puts it here ""Maybe progress should lose for once.""

"Jurassic World | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jurassic-world ) Jurassic World (United States 2015) June 10 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli It has been 22 years since Jurassic Park ushered in the modern age of computer generated imagery becoming the first motion picture to use the then-cutting edge special effects technology to astound and amaze us. Director Steven Spielberg allowed us to believe that dinosaurs were real. Repetition made the second Jurassic Park installment 1997s The Lost World a step down and Universals decision to cut the budget for the third movie 2001s Jurassic Park III seemingly put an end to the saga. However after a 14-year gap the T-Rexes velociraptors and their ilk are back. With Spielberg executive producing and Colin Trevorrow behind the lens its time to again return to a universe where amber-encased prehistoric mosquitoes have made it possible for extinct creatures to roam. Jurassic World features only one returning character from the original trilogy - BD Wong as Dr. Henry Wu - but thats not a drawback. All the necessary types are in place Chris Pratts Owen and Bryce Dallas Howards Claire fill the heroic roles Ty Simpkins Gray and Nick Robinsons Zach are the annoying kids Irrfan Khan is John Hammonds successor and Vincent DOnofrio is the unappealing military-type with his own agenda. Really though the Jurassic Park movies have never been about the human beings be they Sam Neills Alan Grant or Jeff Goldblums Ian Malcom. They have been about the dinosaurs. Jurassic World features plenty of call-backs to Jurassic Park (including I assume the same T-Rex) but there are no cameos for Neill or Goldblum. This is the best of the Jurassic Park sequels and does a better job than episodes 2 and 3 in recreating the ""feel"" of the original. It starts by giving us some time to immerse ourselves in the atmosphere of a fully working dinosaur amusement park - bigger than anything Hammond envisioned.  Clearly no expense has been spared. The tragedies of the original Jurassic Park are long past buried and forgotten with the skeleton of the visitor center. The new version has been open for a decade - long enough that there are concerns about attendance waning. Dinosaurs are no longer enough. Customers want something bigger and meaner. Unsmiling rigid and overtaxed Claire is tasked with keeping the park running - an immense duty that requires a futuristic room and a small army of assistants monitoring the electronics. Owen a velociraptor wrangler has found a way to control - to the extent they can be controlled - the most intelligent of the islands denizens. On the day when everything goes wrong Claires nephews Gray and Zach are in attendance. All hell breaks loose when Jurassic Worlds latest attraction the genetically modified Indomitous Rex escapes from its paddock and decides the 22000 visitors on Isla Nublar might make for a tasty buffet.  In the immortal words of Ian Malcolm ""Oooh ahhh thats how it always starts. Then later theres running and... screaming."" Despite having a slim resume (the quirky indie Safety Not Guaranteed) Trevorrow handles Jurassic World like a pro. He hits all the right notes giving the two-dimensional characters as much heft as they deserve (which isnt much) and handling the action sequences like a seasoned veteran of Hollywood tent pole features. He references countless other monster movies including obvious ones like King Kong and Godzilla and less evident choices like The Birds and (especially) Aliens. His style is part Spielberg/part Cameron. Although this is essentially a big budget monster movie the filmmakers arent above a little social commentary/satire. They identify a vexing challenge faced by amusement parks always having to amp up the thrill level of the attractions to lure back easily bored customers. This could also be seen as an observation about sequels in general and the Jurassic Park films in particular. One T-Rex was enough for the first film.  Now three movies later we need the bigger badder I-Rex. Jurassic World also takes some none-too-subtle jabs at corporate sponsorship and borrows from Aliens when reflecting on the military-industrial complex and how the soldiers mindset considers weaponizing dinosaurs. Composer Michael Giacchino recognizes the importance of embracing John Williams iconic themes rather than jettisoning them (as was done in Man of Steel). Guacchino gives us not only full orchestral renditions of the most noteworthy music but more subdued interpretations when those are appropriate. The dino-effects both CGI and animatronic are superior to those in the earlier Jurassic Park movies but thats not surprising considering how much things have advanced over the years. The 3-D is an utter and complete waste and is best avoided. It exists only because of the Hollywood mindset that all summer blockbusters must be released in 3-D to be considered legitimate. Jurassic World leaves open the door for future installments but while this is an enjoyable popcorn experience it works best as a stand-alone follow-up. Trevorrow and his co-screenwriters deserve credit for milking two more worthwhile hours out of the Jurassic Park idea but theres nowhere else for the concept to go. Its played out. Another sequel would be folly. Thats a future consideration however (likely to be determined exclusively by ). For now theres only Jurassic World which has taken the fossilized remains of a beloved franchise and given it a new life than many doubtlessly thought impossible.

Photo Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Jurassic World Running time 124 minutes. Rated PG-13 (monster violence profanity). ""Jurassic World"" promises a scary new hybrid dinosaur cooked up in a lab that combined T. rex DNA with something else were not immediately told about. For a while the beast is so rageful I was convinced theyd figured out how to graft onto it the personality of Alec Baldwin. That nasty new lizard -- the Indominus rex -- is along with the brilliant special effects and Chris Pratt one of the details that make the first ""Jurassic"" movie since 2001 nearly as much fun as the stellar first two. Jurassic World is a successor to the park that closed after the people-eating rampage (what the suits now call a ""containment anomaly"") that caused its closure. The fully Disney-fied Jurassic World has been operating without incident for 20 years but a numbers-crunching exec (Bryce Dallas Howard) with the corporation that runs it frets about upping the wow factor now that children have gotten bored with dinosaur petting zoos and taking rides on living triceratopses. As she neglects her visiting nephews (Ty Simpkins Nick Robinson) she and the CEO (Irrfan Khan) give the scientists free rein to improve on nature by creating genetically modified dinos. Its kind of like the GMO cherry tomatoes have gotten their revenge at last with a fellow test-tube creation snacking on us like crudites. As if the corporations greed werent bad enough a private military contractor (Vincent DOnofrio) theorizes that the new breed of dino genetically trained to be loyal could be weaponized and set free on bad guys worldwide. The only voice of sanity is that of the honest ex-sailor (Chris Pratt) who lives in a humble trailer fixes motorcycles for fun and has managed to train a brace of velociraptors like dolphins. Its pretty obvious that something could go badly wrong here Joss Whedon could be involved. Im happy to report he isnt and director Colin Trevorrow whose only previous film was the low-budget ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" instead asks himself at every turn ""How would Steven Spielberg do it?"" More filmmakers should pose the question. The answer is lots of quiet moments to establish characters and their bonds uncluttered action scenes that make sense and none of the exasperating not-quite-clever jabber that makes ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" feel like an elbow in the ribs. At times Trevorrow goes with near-quotation -- a big romantic kiss like the one in ""E.T."" a dash under a sliding door like the one in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" even a quick steering-wheel maneuver to shake off a pursuer straight out of the truck chase in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas HowardPhoto Universal Pictures None of this is ever quite as great as it is in Spielbergs work but its reasonably close; the worst you can say about the movie is that it sticks to a highly potent formula. The thrills are there such as when a giant undersea-dwelling dinosaur gobbles up a great white shark (an unforced joke about Spielbergs ""Jaws"") when the two boys find themselves playing the part of the ball in a game of dino soccer while inside a sphere-shaped vehicle with pterodactyls swooping over the food court (why doesnt everyone just run inside?) and when Pratt jumps on a motorcycle and gets his raptor-furies to follow.

VPCThe film doesnt skimp on special effects but the story and dialogue are wooden.Chris Pratt takes the lead in ""Jurassic World.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 2.5 stars (out of 5)The characters are wooden but the dinosaurs are the attraction.The filmmakers give the audience what it wants but nothing more.The dialogue in ""Jurassic World"" is nothing to write home about -- surprise surprise -- but it is telling.""No ones impressed with a dinosaur anymore"" one character says near the beginning of the film. Shes talking about visitors to Jurassic World the theme park built from the ashes of Jurassic Park. But thats the obstacle the filmmakers face too right?When Steven Spielbergs ""Jurassic Park"" debuted in 1993 seeing a velociraptor whiz by or a T-Rex open his jaws and roar was stunning. Truly there hadnt been anything like it before that kind of realism with such fantastic subject matter and there couldnt have been a better director than Spielberg to bring it to life.Related 10 best dinosaurs in the moviesBut its 22 years later both in real life and in the time frame of the film and director Colin Trevorrow and the team of screenwriters acknowledge with that line the challenge they face both in the movie and out. A generation of audiences has seen it all before.Or as they say in the movie ""Consumers want them bigger louder more teeth.""At least on that front ""Jurassic World"" gives the people what they want.Owen (Chris Pratt) trains dinosaurs in ""Jurassic World."" (Photo Universal Pictures)Although customers still flock to the theme park where they can see more and bigger dinosaurs -- kids ride some in one attraction -- growth isnt meeting projections. We learn this from Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) the ice-queen manager who is evidently lacking in any form of human emotion.This gets at another telling line in the film ""Nothing in Jurassic World is natural.""This includes character development.More Jurassic World taps into real world greedTo boost attendance the parks resident scientific genius Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong the lone holdover from the first film) has come up with a new dinosaur or something like it Indominus Rex a genetically engineered creature whose origins are kept a secret. But whats clear is that it is designed to be bigger and badder than anything thats ever come before.What could possibly go wrong?AZCENTRALJurassic World (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes Reviews(If you have to ask you probably need to see more movies. Everything Since Mary Shelley dreamed up ""Frankenstein"" all this god-playing business goes south and in a hurry and ""Jurassic World"" is no exception.)To complicate matters Claires nephews Zach (Nick Robinson) and Gray (Ty Simpkins) are visiting the park but shes been too busy to pay attention to them. But thats OK its not like a vicious dangerous thinking dinosaur is going to escape or anything ... Oh. Wait.Luckily Masrani (Irrfan Khan) the parks owner has hired Owen (Chris Pratt) a former Navy man who has been working to train the velociraptors. Pratts great but here he is your classic Voice of Reason pitted against the scheming Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) who wants to weaponize -- yes -- the velociraptors. Like most of the characters theyre cardboard cutouts meant to suggest action-movie archetypes instead of real people.Guests roam with dinosaurs in safety - for a while - in ""Jurassic World."" (Photo Universal Pictures)The exception to this -- and I may be giving him too much credit just because I think hes so funny -- is Jake Johnson as Lowery the resident nerd who handles the high-tech observation of the dinosaurs. He seems like a real guy whether its acknowledging that wearing an original Jurassic Park T-shirt might not be in such good taste or coming up short in one of the all-time great would-be romantic moments ever (really).But Lowery like the rest of the humans is just a distraction. The dinosaurs are the attraction here both at the park and in the movie. Trevorrow whose only other feature is the terrific indie film ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" (which featured Johnson) knows this and doesnt shy away from it. Hes kind of like Claire and Masrani after all -- he needs to attract paying customers.Thus we get action-packed set pieces and people-chomping and narrow escapes and a few funny one-liners. It all culminates in a finale that is ridiculously over the top in a not entirely bad way. Although remember the complaints about how absurdly destructive the final battle between Superman and General Zod was in ""Man of Steel?"" Trevorrow seems to have constructed his climactic battle for those who thought that fight was far too subtle.Look lets not kid ourselves. Every third person on the planet will go to see this movie and they will find exactly what they seek nothing more but certainly nothing less. Its that nothing more part that ultimately disappoints.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

The characters onscreen were seeing dinosaurs for the first time but it really felt as though the audience was seeing them too. It was as though all the picture books that youd ever seen when you were 8 years old had come to life. By the series second installment we were used to dinosaurs and by the third they were old hat. But the true intelligence of ""Jurassic World"" is that it acknowledges that and doesnt do the obvious stupid thing in response. It doesnt double down on the violence. It doesnt follow the usual summer movie pattern of wall-to-wall action split-second cutting and trembling shaking camera work. Instead ""Jurassic World"" matches the wit and pace of a 1990s monster movie with the attitudes and anxieties of 2015 and the result is a film thats as smart as it is exciting. These days we are every bit as concerned as we were 20 years ago about dinosaurs stepping on us but we have other worries too and ""Jurassic World"" finds a way to incorporate them and satirize them. We have a corporate culture run amok -- embodied here by Bryce Dallas Howard as a crisp-looking theme-park executive who uses the word ""assets"" when she means dinosaurs and ""asset containment unit"" when she means security. We have scientists splicing genes and copyrighting the results embodied by BD Wong as a researcher so intellectually perverted that he cant stop smirking when he talks about his creations. Disruptive ideas And when Dwight Eisenhower warned of the military-industrial complex perhaps he was thinking of Vincent DOnofrio who has the bright idea to weaponize the velociraptors for fighting in the Middle East. DOnofrio is a pleasure to watch here a confident bully and yet with a lightness of spirit that comes from breathing the rarefied air of lunacy. Its 20 years later and human beings with their infinite capacity for adaptation and amnesia especially when theres money to be made have chosen to overlook those unfortunate dinosaur incidents from back in the day. Jurassic World is now a theme park and a lot of thought has gone into it. There is the Gentle Giant petting zoo and opportunities for patrons to roll through a field of plant-eating apatosauruses while protected inside a Plexiglas hamster ball. But the big-ticket items remain the scarier attractions. Unfortunately attendance is down. Nobody cares about the T. rex these days. They want ""bigger more teeth"" and so -- this is really twisted but exactly what would happen -- the scientific team comes up with a ""new asset through gene splicing"" the Indominus rex who is enormous and highly intelligent and can change color and elude heat sensors. Moreover it has such a lousy personality that it kills for fun. But as the movie starts its just a normal day at the park. Claire (Howard) is showing representatives from Verizon around seeking corporate sponsorship for the Indominus rex while her two visiting nephews are being attended by an assistant. Like a Steven Spielberg movie -- though this is directed by Colin Trevorrow -- the opening is leisurely laying down a foundation of relationships that will become important later. For example Claire once had a brief affair with Owen (Chris Pratt) an animal trainer who seems to be the only one in the park who understands that these dinosaurs are alive and have feelings. ""You made them in a test tube"" he says. ""But they dont know that."" Reveling in action The action scenes are imaginative and suspenseful and gradually take on a demented exuberance with huge-headed dinosaurs sniffing at people and velociraptors attacking in packs. The music of Michael Giacchino repurposes the best of John Williams original score and although the film ultimately lacks that extra something that Spielberg often brings -- the sense that the action is somehow emblematic of something grand in the human spirit -- the movie has a caustic wit that will do in its place. With the exception of Pratts animal trainer virtually everyone in ""Jurassic World"" is crazy but they have so much company they dont know it. ""Monster is a relative term"" the scientist (Wong) says as though he can taste the words. ""To a canary a cat is a monster. Were just used to being the cat."" Indeed what ultimately makes ""Jurassic World"" so satisfying is that it doesnt buy into the grandeur of the human spirit not one bit. Instead it shows you a beautifully realized theme park with holograms and concession stands and rides and attractions and presents it ... not even as a monument to arrogance. Even that would be giving it too much credit. Its just a monument to colossal dumbness. ""Jurassic World"" is an intelligent action movie thats saying something simple but true Yes people are that stupid. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Meanwhile the habitat around them has gone Vegas Isla Nublar home of the former dinosaur lunch counter known as Jurassic Park is now the site of a sleek multimillion-dollar resort known as Jurassic World which boasts a petting zoo (where tykes can stroke the noses of adorable baby brontosauruses) an aviary (where terrifying pterodactyls soar behind protective glass) and a Brookstone (because you never know when the desire for a vibrating neck massager might strike).Because Jurassic World has been operating smoothly for years attendees have become bored. And so the resorts resident genetic experts have monkeyed inappropriately with DNA to breed a new creature a dino the size of a skyscraper with frosty white skin and eyes the color of fire opals. Shes an inscrutable ill-tempered beastie but the suits in charge are banking on her as their next star attraction sort of like Cher at the Colosseum.Film Details Jurassic World RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time124 min. More Info Trailer Related StoriesAnatomy of a Scene Jurassic Parks T-Rex IntroductionFilm Podcast Jurassic World and Love amp; MercyAs far as all that stuff goes -- and taking into account the often gorgeous special effects -- Jurassic World is pretty good fun. Especially for a here-today gone-tomorrow summer blockbuster the picture is better-crafted than it needs to be If you ignore some extraneous plot threads and the stop-the-presses revelation that in the end ""what really matters is family"" Jurassic World hangs together surprisingly well. And like the 1993 Steven Spielberg/Michael Crichton dinosaur egg that hatched the whole phenomenon in the first place (Spielberg is an executive producer here) Jurassic World features a generous handful of wondrous moments like visions of placid canoers paddling down a river with graceful brontosauruses striding along everyone minding their own faux-prehistoric business.The plot banked around all that grandness is essentially serviceable Bryce Dallas Howard is Claire the super-businessy business lady who manages Jurassic World. Her nephews Gray and Zach (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) whom she barely knows have decided to take their Christmas holiday exploring this prehistoric world of wonder only to spend much of it running and screaming. Theres also a stalwart velociraptor trainer Chris Pratts Owen who -- spoiler alert -- ends up being the hero of the day and Vincent DOnofrios Hoskins a craven higher-up beholden to the military-industrial complex. Sexy eye-candy guys like B.D. Wong and Irrfan Khan show up in minor roles doing things like flying helicopters and explaining dinosaur genetics. EXPAND Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment In the end of course its only the critters that matter. As far as visual splendor goes Jurassic World is a quality product with all the slickness -- and soullessness -- that implies. Trevorrow has directed only one previous fiction feature the 2012 indie romance-thriller Safety Not Guaranteed but in Jurassic World he orchestrates big special effects like a pro for whatever thats worth. The picture is sleek and impressive although as with its predecessors how much you enjoy it will depend on your tolerance for watching dinosaurs chomp down on terrified humans. Theres a degree of sadism at work here -- it was there in the original and its spin-offs too -- and for me the ninth or tenth instance of an anguished bystander being gobbled or stomped on (or worse) was enough to tip the scales. Though the violence here is relatively discreet and un-bloody its sometimes unpleasantly intense -- a sequence riffing on The Birds only with pterodactyls is particularly harrowing in a possibly exploitative way. Be forewarned if youre thinking of bringing a tiny tot.Still people who remember Jurassic Park fondly from childhood may get a nostalgic kick -- Jurassic World references its predecessor just enough and affectionately. And theres some fine dino-stuff here like Pratts posse of raptors They run along daintily on their three-toed feet their undersized hands curled primly at chest level as if proudly showing off their new Kelly bags. Theres a touching (at least by blockbuster standards) brontosaurus death scene These gentle peace-loving herbivores just dont deserve to go. Most thrilling of all is a multi-dinosaur showdown staged against an inky night sky a glowing half-moon hanging hesitantly in the corner of the frame looking as if its about to scram. You would too if these irascible giants started wrassling anywhere in your vicinity. Who says dinosaurs are yesterdays news? Like wingtip shoes tweed jackets and 69 Ford Mustangs they never go out of style.Directed by Colin Trevorrow. Written by Rick Jaffa Amanda Silver Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow.

The lesson of ""The Lost World Jurassic Park"" ""Jurassic Park III"" and now ""Jurassic World"" is that filmmakers apparently shouldnt attempt to tamper with ""Jurassic Park."" This time around we get four screenwriters -- Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"") and Derek Connolly and director Colin Trevorrow (""Safety Not Guaranteed"") -- who cant be bothered to explain why a deathtrap that was previously the site of three disastrous human-dinosaur interactions would now suddenly be a thriving theme park crawling with heretofore extinct reptiles. See Video Chris Pratt Trains Hunts with Raptors in New Jurassic World Clip (Video) This is just one of the scripts many sins from having park executive Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) outrun a deadly Tyrannosaurus Rex in high heels to Claires suggestion that its in poor taste for employee Lowery (Jake Johnson ""The New Girl"") to wear a vintage Jurassic Park T-shirt when the new attraction built literally atop and around the rubble of the previous failed venture kept one of the two words in that earlier iterations title. Why play Christmas music at the beginning of the film and then feature no holiday decorations in the park? How does a resort near Costa Rica have no Hispanic employees and only one French-speaking black one? What was the thinking behind having four female characters with speaking roles three of whom cry and the fourth getting eaten? (Laura Dern and Ariana Richards you are missed.) And who thought this movie could simultaneously make jokes about corporate sponsorship when it prominently displays signage for Samsung Starbucks Margaritaville and Brookstone at key moments? Worst of all the screenplay mummifies Chris Pratt by making his character Owen so utterly flat and humorless and generic that ten other square-jawed leading men could step in to take over the third-rate ""Romancing the Stone"" love-hate relationship that mans-man Owen has with buttoned-up control queen Claire. Also Read Marvel to Debut Ant-Man Extended Look Before Jurassic World IMAX Screenings There are a few scares and a few laughs to be unearthed in ""Jurassic World"" but not nearly enough of them to reverse the downward slide this series of films has taken with each subsequent sequel. (Yes ""III"" might be a little better than ""The Lost World"" but theyre all disappointments.) Brothers Zack (Nick Robinson ""The Kings of Summer"") and Gray (Ty Simpkins ""Iron Man 3"") are shipped off to Jurassic World by their nearly divorced mom Karen (Judy Greer). Karens sister is Claire whos supposed to keep an eye on her nephews but shes busy dealing with the parks newest upcoming attraction a lab-created Indominus Rex which is even bigger scarier and smarter than the T-Rex. What could possibly go wrong? Meanwhile raptor trainer Owen learns that corporate higher-up Hoskins (Vincent dOnofrio with an unsteady southern accent) has been thinking outside of the park hoping to turn those raptors into a weapon for use in warfare. Again what could possibly go wrong? Also Read Star Wars Jurassic World Avengers Likely to Power Record 2015 Royalty Rates and Retail Sales Early in the film Claire explains the creation of the Dominus Rex as a response to how jaded consumers have become about seeing dinosaurs and thats a moment of ""Jurassic World"" facing its own hurdles -- the computer-generated creatures that rocked our world in 1993 just dont have the same oomph now that weve seen orc armies and Navi warriors flying on dragons and Sandra Bullock orbiting the earth. Trouble is ""Jurassic World"" never works all that hard to wow us either with groundbreaking effects or with a story that remotely holds our attention. If ""Jurassic Park"" was a bright clean gleaming state-of-the-art attraction this latest iteration feels shabby and unexciting with a definite feeling that the carnies are dealing meth behind the haunted house.

"Jurassic World review Reptile dysfunction - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Jurassic World review Reptile dysfunction Jurassic World Industrial Light amp Magic Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment In ""Jurassic World"" business at the retooled dinosaur theme park off the coast of Costa Rica has hit a plateau so scientists are tasked with creating something ""bigger louder ... more teeth."" In ""Jurassic World"" business at the retooled dinosaur theme park off the coast of Costa Rica has hit a plateau so scientists are tasked with creating something ""bigger louder ... more teeth."" (Industrial Light amp Magic Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The park has re-opened for business and business is intermittently exciting. Bailed out by a few good jolts ""Jurassic World"" gets by barely as a marauding-dinosaurs narrative designed for a more jaded audience than the one ""Jurassic Park"" conquered back in 1993.Why was director Steven Spielbergs film version of the Michael Crichton novel a hit? In an industry built on high-concept pitches the first film pitched the highest. Dinos brought back to life; trouble ensues. Digital effects smoothly integrated with animatronics made a quantum leap forward in that picture. Twenty-two years later the rattled happily freaked-out crowd reaction to the shot of the sniveling lawyer getting chomped by the T. rex in an apparent unbroken take remains a vivid memory. For just a second I thought Wow they got that dinosaur to do that in one take A new level of dino-realism if not memorable characterization had come to the screen and Spielberg -- the master populist-sadist -- was happy to deliver Crichtons cinematically preordained goods. Then came a couple of sequels of so-so reputation though I do love that overhead shot of the creatures winding their way through the tall grass in the second picture. Now its do-over time. The carnage and rampant customer dissatisfaction experienced by so many in ""Jurassic Park"" is but a memory. In ""Jurassic World"" directed and co-written by Colin Trevorrow (who did the low-budget charmer ""Safety Not Guaranteed"") business at the retooled dinosaur theme park off the coast of Costa Rica has hit a plateau. Scientists led by B.D. Wong and his cryptic smile have responded to requests for a new star attraction something ""bigger louder ... more teeth.""Behold the genetically engineered hybrid known as Indominus rex. Hes like the T. rex only bigger rexier and soon enough for story purposes ready to bust out of his walled confines to see whats up on the rest of the island snackwise. Regarding the humans Chris Pratt is the hunky yet sensitive raptor trainer and man of action on or off his motorcycle. Though the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" star seems to be playing an actor playing an action hero as opposed to simply being one hes solid company. Bryce Dallas Howard is more like liquid company slipping around in a dumb retrograde watery role of the uptight operations manager whose nephews (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) travel from Madison Wis. to visit. And to get lost and then chased and re-chased. Chris Pratt evolves into leading man in Jurassic World LIndsey Bahr On a recent afternoon on a Universal soundstage Chris Pratt was regaling a group of journalists with a story about elk hunting. Suddenly a gust of air blew through the room toppling a giant fake plant onto a similarly giant speaker before both careened toward one unlucky reporter. Everyone gasped... On a recent afternoon on a Universal soundstage Chris Pratt was regaling a group of journalists with a story about elk hunting. Suddenly a gust of air blew through the room toppling a giant fake plant onto a similarly giant speaker before both careened toward one unlucky reporter. Everyone gasped... (LIndsey Bahr) I mean of course. Of course you know what youre getting in ""Jurassic World."" The second Vincent DOnofrio appears on screen as the InGen security honcho out to weaponize the parks dinosaurs for military purposes you know hell make some predator a nice lunch. Still the romantic banter between Pratt and Howard neednt have been quite this lame. It was probably too much to ask for more wit or a serious mean streak even though the script (credited to four writers) makes a tentative stab or two at rampant product placement early on before getting down to the business of delivering rampant product placement.On a more basic level ""Jurassic World"" futzes a couple of key attacks. When the flying residents of the aviary bust out the threat level is initially unclear. Then in a chaotically staged sequence park visitors run screaming and the bodies start falling and the whole thing is a bit of a blur. The movie recovers with a satisfying series of comeuppances in the climax involving the parks largest (and presumably angriest) attractions. These will likely be enough for those who arent going into ""Jurassic World"" expecting the world. Jurassic World Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment The Indominus rex readies her attack in ""Jurassic World."" The Indominus rex readies her attack in ""Jurassic World."" (Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment) I wasnt expecting the world but I wouldnt have minded sharper jokes and grander action scenes. I wouldve liked a less patronized female lead. I wonder why they couldnt have developed a stronger supporting role for Omar Sy the most sympathetic character (hes the colleague of the Pratt character). At one point we learn that Indominus rex has camouflage capabilities. Universal Pictures clearly is hoping that its intermittently exciting summer tentpole has the same and that because it looks feels and acts like a big deal itll become one.

((c) Universal Pictures) Much like Steven Spielbergs original movie the CGI dinosaurs steal the show in ""Jurassic World."" (Industrial Light amp; Magic) BY Jacob Hall NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday June 10 2015 900 AM Title Jurassic World Film Info The fourth installment in the ""Jurassic Park"" film series directed by Colin Trevorrow. Steven Spielberg set a high bar for dinosaur-fueled action with ""Jurassic Park"" so its sort of unfair that ""Jurassic World"" the fourth film in the series must live in its shadow. Taking place some time after the events of the first movie -- and ignoring the sequels -- the latest entry is again set in a fully functioning dinosaur theme park where everything is perfectly safe. Until it isnt. 1 photos view gallery Jurassic Park cast Where are they now? In a foolhardy attempt to boost attendance the park creates the genetically modified Indominus Rex. Naturally the new star attraction breaks loose and starts treating the visitors like mere stations on an all-you-can-eat buffet. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the icy bigwig in charge of the whole operation and Chris Pratt is the seasoned dino wrangler -- and both are charming. Character actors Vincent DOnofrio and Jake Johnson pop up to chew the scenery with the ferocity of a hungry T-Rex. But forget about those delicious humans. They spend most the movie running and screaming and becoming lunch. The real stars are the computer-generated dinosaurs who get the best moments. Director Colin Trevorrow never manages to capture that Spielbergian sense of wonder -- could anyone? -- but he proves himself a more-than-adequate purveyor of cinematic mayhem. For much of its running time ""Jurassic World"" plays like a great theme park ride. In an age of blockbusters that lumber like herbivores its refreshing to see a movie as lean and mean as a velociraptor. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard charm as the movies human leads. (Chuck Zlotnick) Pratt is ready for action as Velociraptor trainer Owen Grady. (Chuck Zlotnick) Howard tries to prevent the parks downfall as operations manager Claire Dearing. (Chuck Zlotnick) Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins get up close and personal with the dinosaurs as Zach and Gray Mitchell Claires nephews during a visit to the park. After its docile first act ""Jurassic World"" becomes an elaborate exercise in finding ways to make bad situations worse. Parents beware This movie has a mean streak that rivals many horror movies. Do this many people need to be eaten in service of the plot? Must so many nice dinosaurs get slaughtered? Trevorrow does give some dinosaurs a heroic turn. Watching good-guy raptors fight alongside Pratt is a bit like watching the shark from ""Jaws"" make amends with Chief Brody but brave kids will eat it up. And then buy all the toys. Grady keeps his Velociraptor pals under control ... ((c) Universal Pictures) ... and they stick by him when things go wrong. ((c) Universal Pictures) Grady prepares to defend his fellow human survivors. ((c) Universal Pictures) Trevorrows obvious love of this franchise ultimately gets the better of him. ""Jurassic World"" loses its way when it succumbs to fan service and nostalgia with a final act that plays like fan fiction written on a ""Jurassic Park"" message board. Many shots inspire guffaws instead of awe. ""Jurassic World"" is frequently silly and self-indulgent but it works more often than not. For better and worse unlike previous ""Jurassic Park"" sequels this one was at least made by someone who really loves ""Jurassic Park."" ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.

How could he possibly be expected to come up with a sequel that was both bigger and better than the original? With 1997s The Lost World his solution was to give us not one but two T. rexes. Bigger? Yes. Better? Not so much. Perhaps wary of pursuing the same fools errand a second time Spielberg passed the reins to director Joe Johnston for 2001s Jurassic Park III a sequel that could never quite figure out why it existed other than to drop a khaki-clad Sam Neill into a giant birdcage full of shrieking pteranodons and pray for the best. Again the disappointment was palpable. Its now been 14 years since the last movie--plenty of time for us to shake off those lackluster follow-ups and for Spielberg and his brain trust to spitball a new rationale for revisiting their tropical paradise-gone-amok. And while the new Jurassic World pales next to the awe-inspiring spectacle of the original its easily the franchises most thrilling sequel yet. Its been more than two decades since Richard Attenboroughs John Hammond spared no expense in his quixotic attempt to outsmart Mother Nature. Now his park is a fully operational family-friendly destination where little kids ride on the backs of docile triceratops while their parents queue up at the nearby Starbucks. Hammonds dream has become reality. The only problem is the fanny-pack-wearing public has grown bored. So in order to goose attendance the operators of Jurassic World have gone back to the lab to genetically design a newer scarier attraction. Meet the Indominus rex--a standard-issue T. rex amped up with 11 secret herbs and spices to create historys deadliest killing machine. Just as this new super-beastie is about to go live a pair of brothers (Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson) arrive to spend some quality time with their aunt (Bryce Dallas Howard) the parks no-nonsense operations manager. With her severe bob towering heels and ever-present cell phone we know right away that whatever chaos is about to unfold will turn her into a better more nurturing person (ugh). Playing off of her opposites-attract-style is Chris Pratts game warden who with his macho safari shirt sarcasm and animal lovers compassion telegraphs that hes both the movies savior and its conscience (double ugh). As youve probably guessed Jurassic World doesnt have much interest in giving these characters third--or even second--dimensions. (Vincent DOnofrio starts off and winds up as such a cartoon of gung ho military villainy he might as well be played by R. Lee Ermey.) Still director Colin Trevorrow (in a rush to the big leagues after the modest Safety Not Guaranteed) doesnt seem bothered by any of this. Like the theme parks mad scientists trying to rev up the scare factor of their attractions he knows exactly how to get butts into the multiplex by throwing as many CGI dinosaurs gone wild onto the screen as he possibly can in 124 minutes. Its a distraction game. But it works. Normally Id grouse about that kind of bread-and-circuses cynicism. But its what makes Jurassic World such breathless summer entertainment. Exposition and character-building chitchat are kept at a minimum as we gawk at raptors on the prowl prehistoric sea monsters breaching out of their water pens to feed on a great white and our old pal T. rex slugging it out with the new-and-improved I. rex. All of this is a bit ironic considering that 40 years ago it was Spielberg who single-handedly reinvented the old-school monster movie in Jaws by showing us as little of his killer shark as he could get away with. Back then he didnt have much choice because his mechanical great white was such a dud that he was forced to keep it hidden (those who didnt know better called this Hitchcockian). These days we dont have much patience for those kinds of coy cat-and-mouse games. We want to see our dinosaurs rampaging fast and furious over and over. In that sense Jurassic World is a blockbuster of its moment. Its not deep. There arent new lessons to be learned. And the films flesh-and-blood actors are basically glamorized extras. But when it comes to serving up a smorgasbord of bloody dino mayhem it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do beautifully.

Close Join the conversation... On Twitter With Chris Vognar Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh You might ask yourself why ambitious scientists and entrepreneurs would keep investing in living breathing dinosaur theme parks when the results always seem to get a tad bloody. The answer as delineated in Jurassic World can be traced to one of Steven Spielbergs favorite themes the melding of greed and ambition. Which come to think of it also sums up the summer movie season pretty well.Spielberg directed the first two Jurassic Park movies; hes merely an executive producer on this the fourth. But his tyrannosaurus-size footprint is all over Jurassic World from the bad guys who place ignoble goals over public safety to the subtext that emphasizes lost innocence and the sanctity of the nuclear family. And of course the really cool dinosaurs who remain the chomping sprinting soaring stars of the show. The latest scientific/capitalistic Jurassic overstep involves a genetic hybrid dino-monster which naturally escapes its theme park cage in the first half of the movie. A raptor wrangler (Chris Pratt always an invitingly jocular action hero presence) sees the dinosaurs as intelligent animals. A conniving military contractor (Vincent DOnofrio) sees them as a potential weapon. The parks owner (Irrfan Khan) sees them as an investment. The woman who runs the place (Bryce Dallas Howard) sees them as a job. Only her two nephews - bless the innocent children - view them with wide-eyed wonder. A movie like Jurassic World must pass one basic test Stay diverting if not spectacularly entertaining even through the most ridiculous scenarios. Mission accomplished. The dino-monster crashes into the parks aviary -- ""a containment anomaly"" in the parlance of a public-address security announcement -- and unleashes a torrent of pterodactyls that flap swoop and bite with abandon that would make Hitchcocks Birds proud. The raptors militarized in an effort to bring down the big prey go hunting through a dark forest only to suffer from an unfortunate case of divided loyalties. Theres plenty to gape at in Jurassic World. Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt in a scene from ""Jurassic World."" Universal Pictures Forty years ago Spielberg unleashed Jaws the story of a beach town mayor who doesnt want to close the beach and miss out on the big tourist season. The bad guys in Jurassic World want to keep messing with dinosaur DNA for similar profit motives. (Side note The military contractor is the current bad guy of choice in the movies. See also Aloha. Or better yet dont).But the most penetrating moment in Jurassic World comes courtesy of a towering herbivore dinosaur brought down by the great beast. Pratt and Howard approach the noble creature laid out on in a field and stroke its face. It heaves a few heavy sighs its eyes filled with awareness of its mortality and it breathes its last. Its a tremendously powerful scene that borrows a lesson from the movie that created this entire genre 1933s King Kong Through facial expression and precise movement a gargantuan creature can convey piercing emotion.The jokes will continue to write themselves How high is the dino park insurance premium these days? Is genetic dinosaur splicing the most dangerous move in movies outside of messing with Liam Neesons family? But Jurassic World for all its predictable requisite mayhem still manages to maintain a human touch. Jurassic World (B+)Directed by Colin Trevorrow.

""No ones impressed by a dinosaur anymore"" notes one character early on in ""Jurassic World"" and its easy to imagine the same words having passed through the lips of more than one Universal Studios executive in the years since Michael Crichton and Steven Spielbergs 1993 ""Jurassic Park"" shattered box office records along with the glass ceiling for computer-generated visual effects. Two decades and two lackluster sequels later producer and studio have spared few expenses in crafting a bigger faster noisier dinosaur opus designed to reclaim their place at the top of the blockbuster food chain. What theyve engineered is an undeniably vigorous assault of jaw-chomping jolts and Spielbergian family bonding that nevertheless captures only a fraction of the original films overflowing awe and wonderment. Which should still be more than enough to cause a T-rex-sized ripple effect at the summer multiplex turnstile. If the first ""Jurassic Park"" served as a game-changing harbinger of the CGI-era tentpole movie (as well as the movie-as-theme-park-attraction-as-movie) ""Jurassic World"" can be seen as a self-aware commentary on the difficulties of sustaining a popular franchise in an age when spectacular ""event"" movies are the rule more than the exception. The galloping gallimimus herd and screen-filling T-rex head of 93 now seem almost as quaint as the stop-motion ape of the 1933 ""King Kong"" after the VFX breakthroughs of ""Lord of the Rings"" ""Avatar"" and the two recent ""Planet of the Apes"" movies (whose writer-producers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver share ""Jurassic World"" screenplay credit with director Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly). And when ""Jurassic World"" begins a similar dilemma faces the operators of the eponymous theme park which after a rocky start is running incident-free on that doomed Costa Rican isle of Isla Nublar where it has become a full-fledged Disney-like resort complete with luxury Hilton hotel (one of the many brands seemingly unfazed by placing its products in a movie about a literal tourist trap). Business is booming at Jurassic World yes but in the tourism business as in Hollywood stasis is a kind of death. The public -- and moreover generous corporate sponsors -- want ever more bang (and teeth) for their buck observes the no-nonsense Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) a loyal corporate flack who oversees park operations for Simon Masrani (Irrfan Khan) the Indian billionaire who inherited Isla Nublar from the late John Hammond (Richard Attenborough). So its time for a little razzle-dazzle cooked up by ex-Hammond geneticist Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong the sole ""Jurassic Park"" cast member to reprise his role here) a new hybrid dinosaur breed known as Indominus rex (or more precisely Verizon Wireless Indominus rex) made from T-rex DNA and whatever else tumbled into the gene splicer. Will these people never learn? Not as long as the thrill-seeking public keeps queuing up for more. Bits of dinosaur DNA isnt all thats been recombined here and if youve ever seen a ""Jurassic Park"" movie (or maybe any movie) it doesnt take much guesswork to figure out that all of mans state-of-the-art structural engineering will fail and Indominus rex will get to stretch her mighty legs all over Isla Nublar. The roles of the obligatory imperiled children are filled this time by Claires two visiting nephews -- a surly hormonal teen (Nick Robinson) and his geeky dino-obsessed younger brother (Ty Simpkins) -- whose parents are (per the Spielberg norm) in the throes of divorce. In lieu of Pete Postlethwaites big game hunter from ""The Lost World"" ""Jurassic World"" gives us Vincent DOnofrio as a jingoistic military type who envisions using dinosaurs as battlefield soldiers. And standing in for Sam Neills eminently practical paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant we get Chris Pratt as sardonic ex-Navy man Owen Grady whos spent years not-quite-taming a pack of captive velociraptors (the ""Jurassic"" films most intelligent and lethal predators). They dont quite eat out of Gradys hands just yet but at least they dont bite (or bite off) the hands that feed them. Pratt is effortlessly engaging here doing a minor-key variation on the stoner-surfer Indiana Jones routine he deployed to fine effect in last summers ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (a more inventive risk-taking studio movie than this one). He certainly gets more to do than Howard whose part is like a third-generation xerox of the high-strung damsels-in-distress played by Kathleen Turner in ""Romancing the Stone"" and Kate Capshaw in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" Then again the ""Jurassic"" films have never exactly been rich on the human side -- perhaps the key point that kept even the original film for all its technical wizardry from fulfilling Spielbergs stated desire to create a ""land-based Jaws."" What it lacked in character however ""Jurassic Park"" more than made up for in ingenious booby traps and hairsbreadth escapes several of which now rank among the iconic moments in modern action-fantasy cinema (an angry T-rex treating a Mercedes SUV like a matchbox car; two velociraptors cornering their human prey in an industrial kitchen). ""Jurassic World"" doesnt produce any such memorable setpieces but its generally a more imaginative work than ""The Lost World"" and (especially) the woeful Joe Johnston-directed ""Jurassic Park III"" which both found unduly contrived ways of returning key characters to the very dinosaur-infested isles they swore they would never revisit while adding new characters so unlikable that they could scarcely be devoured quickly enough. Trevorrow who turned heads when he was handed the ""Jurassic"" reins (after having directed only the modestly charming Amblin-esque time-travel romance ""Safety Not Guaranteed"") gives the movie a warmer brighter touch closer in feel to the original film especially in its central sibling rivalry and the portrait of a childless adult (Howard here Neill there) whose parental instincts are awakened by dino-trauma. But hes far less adept at staging big action (which tends to be more frantic than thrilling) and some of the movies best ideas remain oddly underdeveloped like unhatched eggs. Having seeded the promising notion of rampaging dinos turned loose on the unsuspecting public (a la the final moments of ""The Lost World"") ""Jurassic World"" ultimately makes little of it relegating most of the action to the parks interior far from the madding crowd. Ditto the Indominus rexs nifty adaptive camouflaging ability. And only late in the day (too late) does the movie arrive at the tantalizing ""Godzilla""-like suggestion that sometimes man and monster might find themselves united against a common enemy. Trevorrow has littered the film with sly callbacks to the original ""Jurassic Park"" plus amusing nods to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" ""The Birds"" and many others. Its fun enough while it lasts but somehow finally all too much and not enough. The problem isnt that dinosaurs have ceased to impress us but that dinosaurs alone are not enough to sustain us in a sophisticated blockbuster culture that has only just recently given us the topsy-turvy emotional landscape of ""Inside Out"" the determined desert fugitives of ""Mad Max Fury Road"" and the all-too-human ape leader Caesar of ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" -- movies as bold in their storytelling and as rich in their emotional stakes as they are spectacular in their visual derring-do. ""Jurassic World"" starts out as a satire of bigger-is-better corporate groupthink only to become the very object of its scorn -- a giant wind-up machine thats all roar and precious little bite. The dinos themselves have rarely looked better than they do under the direction of VFX supervisor Tim Alexander especially Indominous rex (arguably the movies most well-developed female character) and a new underwater beastie whos like Shamu on steroids. Composer Michael Giacchino provides wall-to-wall pulse-pounding percussion horns and strings though the tunes most viewers will come out whistling are John Williams extensively recycled ""Jurassic Park"" themes.

Hafiz says August 5 2015 at 349 am i love the ""Jurassic World "" all part ...this is a really good movie lots of fun in this move.. and also some horrible movie Reply Tommy Peters says June 27 2015 at 1125 pm Caught this on a bad torrent but it was enough to reminisce not of Spielbergs opus but Disneys George of the Jungle with bits of Travoltas sexist one-liners high heels and all. Not the first time a screenplay made a villainous dinosaur hilarious but it is the first to lift our protagonist from the equally hysterical Godzilla. Cmon Be children. 5 stars for fun Reply Jan Harde says June 22 2015 at 852 pm Hello all well for those who have seen this you will know what I am talking about and for those thinking of watching it you may want to read this first. I LOVED the Original Jurassic Park and NOT the sequels as most agree and this movie was so hyped that I think I expected much much more. It was like what Cath here before me said ""a Let down"" BIG time way to slow in the beginning no story line at all and NO WAY I would take children to see this movie with all the gore and half eaten people and dying and dead creatures everywhere. Not an exciting story for children at all and Mr. Spielberg you were asleep at the switch so to say and this is NOT your normal excellence in movie making. It was Purely made for the Almighty DOLLAR nothing else at all and the next of the Jurassic sequels to come and YES there will be more  How exciting  NOT we are probably in for more DRECK like most of this was except for the always incredible visual effects and CGI that they are famous for. So in closing slow beginning half way to much death and gore for children how did it get a PG rating.CRAZY.  ENJOY the summer all. Reply Cath says June 17 2015 at 454 am This movie was a bit fat FAIL Simply terrible bad cast bad script very thin on plot and no real star. Reply Rex says June 15 2015 at 1058 am Oh come ON. Jurassic Park III wasnt THAT bad. Not as good as the first two but at a lean 90-ish minutes it was a solid little thrill show. Just sayin . . . Reply Dickrichie says June 15 2015 at 337 am everyone that likes this movie went in with low to now expectations. Which makes sense cause all they want is to be reminded of the eye candy from their past. That doesnt make Jurassic World a good movie. It makes it a mediocre movie that reminds you of how you felt watching a better movie. It had a giant opening weekend. It will probably push the next sequel it will be soon forgotten though because theres nothing memorable about the film. C+ at best Reply Dashingscorpio says June 14 2015 at 108 pm Scott It looks as though that line ""No ones impressed by a dinosaur anymore"" was far from true ""Box Office Jurassic World Sets Global Record With 511.8 Million Debut"" Its probably no coincidence the biggest block busters are usually the most ""unrealistic"" escapism. Maybe people are embracing these ""popcorn movies"" to escape all the negativity in the news from around the world. It seems going to the movies is one thing people from every nation enjoys doing. Reply delete itunes says June 14 2015 at 959 am ive just watched the original and forgotten how much Arianna Richards continual screaming got on my wick. Id also forgotten that Samuel L. Jackson was in it. Reply priscillakennedy says June 13 2015 at 1101 am People dont go to Jurassic Park movies for rich character driven dramablah blah blah.....they go for the child in them that wants to see dinosaurs come to life to see them run fly and eat people. Not every movie has to be a deep thought provoking experience. I sometimes want a thrill a minute special effects extravaganza. And this move delivers in spades Reply Riley says June 16 2015 at 443 pm I go to movies for the story because movies are stories not 90 minute light shows and displays of computer generated imagery. But I am in the minority of course. If Jurassic Park could tell a good story this one could have (and sort of did) as well. Reply Steve says June 11 2015 at 1153 pm ""an angry T-rex treating a Mercedes SUV like a matchbox car""? The SUVs were Ford Explorers in the first movie not Mercedes. Reply soleillune says June 11 2015 at 927 pm I went to see it and its not very good. The plot however little there is is idiotic. If you dont care whether there is intelligence or not in a movie then you might like it. If you like when things make sense then dont bother. Reply ohsnap says June 11 2015 at 328 pm Yeah Ill go see it. But all the ones not directed by Steven Spielberg have lacked something. His direction of the Jurassic movies reminded me of the old sci-serials and I really liked them. After viewing the trailers it seems like this movie is made for 13 yrs old who like movies like The Transformers and is mainly for visual effects. Nothing will be as awe inspiring and scary as the first one. Maybe its time to let the franchise go. Reply Rex says June 15 2015 at 1104 am I suspect in due time well learn that Spielberg directed portions of Jurassic World. I realize that franchises these days have such tight rules regarding their construction that a novice like Trevorrow could logically be handed the gig but not without SERIOUS oversight to make sure he stayed on message visually and story-wise. This kind of show practically writes and directs itself so Trevorrows followup shows may prove whether he was a more than just a front man on this one. Reply Rex says June 15 2015 at 1104 am I just gave myself some memories of Poltergeist right there . . . ;-) LOL says June 11 2015 at 119 pm Just got back from seeing it. It was average crap with no plot and that ending was so obvious. The dinosaurs look like software. Reply Philm Guy says June 11 2015 at 111 am It was Bob Peck who played the big game hunter in JP. A terrific actor he sadly died just a few years after making that film. Reply Nanny Mo says June 10 2015 at 1038 pm So I went to an advanced screening. Heres the dope If you like the kind of Spielberg movie where you leave your mind at the door and jump at romance and jokes aimed at a 13 year old youll like this film. It was fun funny dorky and just what youd expect from Spielberg. Frankly I liked it but dont over-think it its not a brilliant film and yes if you foresee it happening it probably does. Entertaining it is classical brilliant cinema it is not. Go see it for fun. Reply Riley says June 16 2015 at 445 pm This isnt a Spielberg directed movie... Reply Rex says June 15 2015 at 1105 am Many thanks Captain Obvious. Reply Henrik D.R. says June 10 2015 at 602 pm Great review kind of got the same impression. Reply stevenkovacs says June 10 2015 at 221 pm Meh Reply Josh says June 10 2015 at 115 pm Absolutely spot on review Reply me says June 10 2015 at 928 am There is also a (huge) level of snobbery when it comes to movies like this as if admitting to enjoying oneself for 2 hours is beneath people. It can just be fun for funs sake (and sorry GOTG may be a lot of things but original isnt one of them). You only get one chance to make a first impression. After all this time it is impossible to be awed by a Jurassic Park movie because that already happened. Reply Alistair Taylor says June 14 2015 at 400 pm Couldnt agree more. I thoroughly enjoyed it because I knew I wasnt getting Citizen Kane I was getting a Jurassic Park sequel. As for GOTG it was a good movie but it was just Star Wars redone yet again and Serenity nailed that particular genre better than anything since the originals. Reply John K says June 10 2015 at 344 pm Yes. You nailed it. This movie will probably be exactly what 90% of the people who walk in to see it are expecting. Reply fred mertz says June 10 2015 at 905 am Thats a nasty headline. Reply Lee Mastroddi says June 10 2015 at 844 am Its a Jurassic Park movie poured into a Transformers mold. As such it will reach its intended audience most of whom are not in the U.S. Reply Bill B. says June 10 2015 at 835 am Been there done that but I do like Pratt. Reply Adele says June 10 2015 at 1131 am I dont like Pratt or any of the other pumped-up Chrises currently polluting the plexes. Reply Mr. Average says June 10 2015 at 831 am Whose not whos. Reply Deek says June 10 2015 at 822 am Whenever the lead into a review uses the term ""critic-proof"" I audibly grown. Basically the critic is going to spend several paragraphs trying to convince you not to see the movie but they know you will. ""Go see Fury Road"" which became a critical darling in spite of it basically being a two-hour car chase based on a series of successful B-movies from the 80s. Oh dont forget to drop in a comparison to a film that made its debut in Cannes but hasnt been released widely yet so we know how much hipper you are than us when it comes to movies But seriously why throw in the term ""critic-proof""? Its like you take it personally that people will go see a movie about dinosaurs eating people instead of listening to a stuffy critic who uses phrases like ""jingoistic military type."" The term jingoistic infers military type so why be so wordy? Its the writing equivalent of digital effects. Reply Rex says June 15 2015 at 1107 am Not everyone who is jingoistic is AUTOMATICALLY in the military. Geeez man . . . Reply Alistair Taylor says June 14 2015 at 402 pm Glad Im not the only one that thought Fury Road was this years biggest let down after all the critical hype. I thought it was rubbish. Reply Nanny Mo says June 10 2015 at 737 am Well its possible that Spielberg has jumped his own shark but I am going to go and see this one if for no other reason than I got a free ticket. Plus Universals Parks needed to do something to keep the ride current it was starting to feel like the old vintage ride among the new ideas. Reply Arindam Bhattacharjee says June 10 2015 at 649 am Ive yet to see the movie but the review was thoroughly entertaining to read. One question Why the mention of Verizon before Indominus rex? I mean what kind of a product placement is that if it is so indeed? Reply Terry Daniel (voiceoversbytd) says June 10 2015 at 644 am Jurassic World is your typical summer blockbuster fluff. Poor acting and nonsensical dialogue reminiscent of the old ""Land of the Lost"" series. Like many of the Star Wars prequel films most of the cast seemed to just check in and collect a paycheck. Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent DOnofrio were so god awful that I couldnt stop laughing. You know its bad when the most interesting character in the film is a sick dinosaur. As expected it was visually stunning but lacked the suspense and magic of that first film. I wasnt expecting ""Jurassic Park"" but I wasnt expecting a Roger Corman B-movie either. Reply Ivan el Terrible says June 10 2015 at 804 am ""I wasnt expecting a Roger Corman B-movie either"" Bloody hell even the worst thing Corman has ever done is still better than most of the summer blockbusters of the last years. Reply Brian Wiley says June 11 2015 at 352 am Unfortunately It seems these bonehead blockbusters are now aimed at foreign audiences who seem to devour our crap. macd says June 10 2015 at 933 am Actually just about all of these recent summer ""blockbusters"" are merely ripoffs of Roger Cormans quickies of yesteryear the main difference being the humongous budgets and half the entertainment value. Moviegoers (in the U.S. at least) are already tiring of these bloated B cinematic turds and I for one think a sequel to ""Humanoids from the Deep"" would be a lot more fun than ""Jurassic-IV"". BrucePayne says July 14 2015 at 317 pm Stop spamming viruses on every review jerk.

Daily Edition Login to download Jurassic World Film Review 600 AM PDT 6/10/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Courtesy of Universal Pictures A serviceable stab at Spielbergs franchise TWITTER Chris Pratt Bryce Dallas Howard and Vincent DOnofrio star in the franchises first installment in 14 years. Intensely self-conscious of its status as a cultural commodity even as it devotedly follows the requisite playbook for mass-audience blockbuster fare Jurassic World can reasonably lay claim to the No. 2 position among the four series entries as it goes down quite a bit easier than the previous two sequels. The 14-year layoff since the last one may well have helped in that the new films perspective on antiseptic theme park-style tourism and relentless commercialization while hardly radical plainly announces its makers sense of humor about their own projects multifaceted mercantile motives. Although not terribly scary and closer to PG than R in its frights and gore Universals big summer action release is sufficiently toothsome to make audiences everywhere happy for a return visit to a once-wild world that superficially looks as safe and domesticated as a Universal Studios tour. The latest unlikely suspects to make the jump from quirky niche low-budget fare to big studio extravaganza filmmaking director Colin Trevorrow and his screenwriting partner Derek Connolly in 2012 made the disarmingly offbeat and fringe-dwelling Safety Not Guaranteed which scarcely looked like the kind of thing that would punch anyones ticket for the cinematic planet occupied and significantly owned by Steven Spielberg. For this outing at least Trevorrow has sidelined slow-burn drollery in favor of the requisite five-speed transmission and booming speaker system. But while the scale and generic nature of this sort of franchise endeavor almost inevitably homogenizes a variable amount of a personal filmmakers imprint Trevorrow would seem to suggest that he has not irrevocably gone over to the other side but rather is testing some different waters for fun and profit. It can also have only helped that the other screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver had so smartly navigated a new approach to another recent sci-fi franchise about allegedly docile beasts gone wild with the new Planet of the Apes series. The first wise move was pretending that The Lost World Jurassic Park (1997) and Jurassic Park III (2001) never existed and that the world depicted here descends directly from Spielbergs 1993 adaptation of Michael Crichtons novel. Read more Jurassic World to Get Biggest-Ever Worldwide Release by Imax This line of reasoning takes us to a Costa Rican island serviced by large boats that bring hordes of tourists over to stay in humongous hotels and take trams through terrain occupied by genetically engineered herbivore dinosaurs so benign that they could have been playmates of Dinosaur Bob. Among the many new arrivals are two brothers good-looking teenager Zach (Nick Robinson) whos checked out mentally (as well as by the young ladies around) and younger dweebier Gray (Ty Simpkins) whos distraught over what he thinks is their parents imminent divorce. The boys aunt Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) manages the park has arranged VIP passes and is supposed to look out for them but shes too busy memorizing corporate speak keeping her hair unmussed and strutting around the jungle in heels to pay them much heed. Her handsome erstwhile fling and former Navy guy Owen (Chris Pratt) is a sort of dinosaur whisperer who has established a certain understanding with some young raptors being raised in captivity while the gung-ho Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio) has undertaken a controversial project to militarize the talents of the new breed of dinosaurs. At the top of the food chain is billionaire Jurassic World owner Masrami (Irrfan Khan) whose response to a slight dip in profits is to keep building bigger and better dinosaurs; the current star attraction is a gigantic sea creature that zooms straight up out of its pool to swallow in one gulp a great white shark dangling from a hook above a spectacle which one is inclined to interpret as a sly admission by Spielberg as to how far the world has moved on since Jaws. But managements secret project engineered by brilliant amoral scientist Henry Wu (BD Wong) is an enormous new T. rex-like predator that goes by the name ""Indominus rex"" and is sure to send revenues soaring once again. The main objectives of the script are to work out the timing and net result of Indominus escape whom he should eat and how many close calls can be arranged with characters who are clearly not meant to die; those whose fate it is to become dino chow pretty much have signs pinned to their backs from the get-go. Read more Chris Pratt Im Never Going to Be Fat Again Despite the storys formulaic structure and the predictable nature of its cautionary stance on playing God the old-fashioned Saturday matinee-like pleasures stemming from resourceful derring-do in the face of mighty odds retain an appeal -- if done reasonably well -- which is the case here. The action only occasionally rises to rousing and the romance such as it is between the watered-down Indiana Jones type appealingly played by Pratt and the corporate mouthpiece less engagingly embodied by Howard never gets off the ground. Whats more the two brothers are thinly drawn with the older one in particular remaining off-putting for far too long behind his ever-present earphones. Still theres a certain low-key affability about Trevorrows approach that marks him a likeable humanist rather than a director determined to hammer the viewer into submission which unfortunately is what you feel with too many giant franchise projects such as this. This is after all a story about humankinds fallibility hubris and inclination to bring destruction upon itself and one at least feels little tremors of this awareness leaking out between the creatures deafening stomps and roars. On the whole the film successfully steers clear of a significant CGI look and Michael Giacchinos score skillfully takes certain cues from John Williams prior series work but develops a pronounced character of its own.

And watching the film you have to wonder what took so long. Because the films basic approach is to do for ""Jurassic Park"" what ""Jaws 3D"" did for ""Jaws."" That sequel took the Steven Spielberg classic jettisoned the original cast added 3D effects and set the whole thing in a busy amusement park where the big attraction started eating the people -- with hunky hero Dennis Quaid and plucky heroine Bess Armstrong saving who they could. This sequel takes another Steven Spielberg classic jettisons the original cast adds 3D effects and sets the whole thing in a busy amusement park where the big attraction starts eating the people -- with hunky hero Chris Pratt and plucky heroine Bryce Dallas Howard saving who they can. Really it took a decade to figure this out? Still its a fun film - a lot more fun than the cheesy ""Jaws 3D"" honestly with good special effects and a few twists. And along with the repurposed plot comes a sort of retro kind of comforting 80s feel with -- until a final hyper-edited battle sequence -- a seeming willingness to allow the scenes some room to breathe. In this new story the amusement park Jurassic World is finally up and running (and man what are their insurance premiums like?) On one side of the island park executive Howard is playing host to two young nephews she hasnt seen in years. On the other side Pratt is training velociraptors for (of course) a super-secret military experiment. And eventually the kids Howard Pratt and the raptors all meet - brought together by a new genetically engineered dinosaur that makes T. Rex look like Rex Reed. And who just escaped. Pratt remains a warmly engaging presence throughout and Howard eventually brings life to a character who starts off nearly as annoying as Kate Capshaw in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."" Even seen through 3D glasses though the rest of the cast - including Vincent DOnofrio as the baddie - remains stubbornly two-dimensional. Director Colin Trevorrow smartly keeps his new dinosaur Indominus Rex - who sounds like a character out of ""Mad Max Fury Road"" - offscreen for as long as possible introducing her in bits and pieces. And theres a terrific sequence when a flock of pterodactyls break out of their aviary and go hunting and pecking among the tourists. Yet although Spielberg produced (and closely advised) and the new score uses chunks of John Williams old one this film pales next to the first. That one had a sense of wonder (like the first breathless glimpse of the dinos running wild). A sense of visual imagination too (like the famous shot of the jiggling Jell-o). And yes a certain appreciation (thanks to original author Michael Crichton) of the power and problems of science. But who needs a bunch of scientists wandering around talking about ethical considerations when we can have disposable victims and dully dependable villains (military contractors corporate billionaires). Why do ""Jaws"" with its flashes of ""Moby Dick"" obsessiveness and classic movie style when you can do ""Jaws 3D"" with its invocation of disaster-movie cliches and lunge-at-the-screen shocks? This movie sadly isnt interested in providing much more than that and really thats OK - a simple warm-weather adventure movie can be fun too. What bothers me is that I think it suspects we arent interested in more than that anymore either. The dinosaurs may still be evolving it seems. But were going backwards. Ratings note The film contains some strong language and violence. Jurassic World (PG-13) Universal (124 min.) Directed by Colin Trevorrow. With Chris Pratt  Bryce Dallas Howard.

Jurassic World has absolutely no reason for being (except for the obvious one) but at least it chomps your time painlessly. Much like the fully functioning tourist attraction thats now flourishing on the haunted grounds of Isla Nublar some 22 years after the first film the movie exists against logic--white-haired John Hammond would smile at his vision finally realized a Starbucks a Pandora a baby-dino petting zoo crammed gift shops huge crowds. You wait (not too long) for something to go wrong--for some fat kid to get eaten. But apart from a scary Birds-like aerial raid of pterodactyls picking off folks on Main Street theres little carnage rained down on mall rats. Instead sequel director Colin Trevorrow (Safety Not Guaranteed) seems content to execute a lesser Aliens Hes got his Ripley figure in Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) a brittle park manager who blooms into a protective Amazonian mom after a toothy hybrid goes rogue; he mounts generically staged action sequences involving flares and bared shoulders; and he sneaks in an evil military plot represented by an extra-wide Vincent DOnofrio. While slickly enjoyable in parts the biggest misstep here comes by puncturing Spielbergs grandeur. Guardians of the Galaxys Chris Pratt playing a jokey animal trainer who lives in a trailer turns vicious velociraptors into docile dogs (a crime against classic cinema). Meanwhile John Williamss majestic trumpet fanfare is redeployed not at the sight of a towering brontosaurus but at the spectacle of the park itself packed to the gills with faceless hopefully nonlitigious attendees. Subtly the movie celebrates money not science and its own stubborn resilience.

I love the realistic looking dinosaurs and all of the intense action. After taking over a decade long break Universal Pictures came out with this new installment in the series. I was hooked the moment I saw the first trailer tease. After watching this movie I was not disappointed in the slightest. Chris Pratt does a wonderful job of interacting with the ""dinosaurs"" and made it such a thrill. What I thought made this movie so much better and different from the previous films is that there are a lot more human casualties.; the entire theme park gets attacked by dinosaurs which contrasts the previous films where it was a small group of people on an isolated island.

"Review Jurassic World a pulse-pounding triumph - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Jurassic World a pulse-pounding triumphBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 06/10/2015 112558 AM PDTUpdated 06/10/2015 053624 PM PDT Related StoriesJun 10Jurassic World 5 best dinosaurs in pop cultureJun 10Jurassic World 5 best dinosaurs in pop cultureDuring the first half-hour of ""Jurassic World"" the idea of cooking up a new dinosaur species in a lab seems more believable than some of the human dialogue in the film.Thank goodness for giant dinosaurs who enjoy devouring tourists so we dont have to pay too much attention to what else is going on.Actually ""Jurassic World"" gets better as it goes along. And while it might not top the groundbreaking 1993 ""Jurassic Park"" it definitely is the best of the three sequels. Of course it follows the familiar drill Humans mess with nature despite the obvious risks; nature strikes back; humans run for their lives and not all of them make it. The Indominus Rex readies her attack in Jurassic World. (Universal Pictures) ( Universal Pictures ) But some things are different this time. For one thing we get more empathetic and likable characters (cmon admit it you kind of wanted to see those kids in ""Jurassic Park"" end up on the T-rexs plate). We also get great pacing compared to the first three films which frequently were bogged down and took too much time setting up the big moments. Once ""Jurassic World"" gets moving it explodes into a big roller coaster ride that lasts just long enough and never spends too much time in one place. And despite the silly dialogue and some wince-inducing character stereotypes early on ""Jurassic World"" is a well-constructed film with a clear convincing plot progression and a surprisingly good ending.Advertisement Its been a couple of decades since John Hammond hatched -- literally -- his dream of turning an island full of cloned dinosaurs into a theme park. Now with Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) at the helm Jurassic World runs like a well-oiled clock with 20000 tourists streaming into a setup that looks like Disneyland Tahiti. As long as the suits can reinvigorate the park with a new feature every few years all is well with the investors. Then scientists go too far and design something called an Indominous rex. Chris Pratt as Owen Grady in Jurassic World. (Universal Pictures) ( Universal Pictures ) Unfortunately -- at least for the trainers a SWAT team some military contractors and a bunch of peaceful plant-eating dinos -- the resulting new dinosaur is the equivalent of a terribly intelligent serial killer the size of a five-story building.Chris Pratt plays Owen Grady a former Navy specialist who works as the trainer and alpha male of the parks pack of velociraptors. His relationship with Claire is that of a spurned almost-boyfriend which at first results in some flat and tedious attempts at humor. Hes also the voice of reason when contractor Vic Hoskins (Vincent DOnofrio in an over-the-top role that isnt clearly explained) schemes to turn the velociraptors into military weapons to use against enemies in the Middle East.Also thrown into the mix are Claires two nephews visiting the park for the first time. They function more or less as the barometer for Claires transition from icy business woman to loving aunt. And of course they fill the films need for children who are constantly in danger of becoming human pizza rolls.Even with its flaws ""Jurassic World"" works thanks to director Colin Trevorrows great sense of pacing and flair for drama that transcends the idea of beasts chasing humans. Theres a terror-inducing escape of rampaging pterodactyls that looks like a modern-day scene from ""The Birds"" and great tension generated in another scene in which the velociraptors have to decide where their allegiance lies. It would be perfectly fair to expect more of the same from a fourth movie about escaped dinosaurs chasing people but ""Jurassic World"" shows a real evolution in quality with its blend of gorgeous photography special effects storytelling and characters who round out and become affecting by the films end. Plus removing Sam Neill and his characters wet towel personality was addition by subtraction. All these qualities make ""Jurassic World"" a great candidate for popcorn movie of the summer. Especially for a new generation of moviegoers who havent experienced the thrill of dinosaurs seemingly jumping off the big screen to eat them.
