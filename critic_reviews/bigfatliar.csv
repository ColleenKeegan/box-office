"Big Fat Liar Is Good Mean Fun washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Big Fat Liar Is Good Mean Fun Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 8 2002 ""BIG FAT LIAR"" is ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" for middle-schoolers. No wait. ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (or at least the watered-down version thats currently in theaters) is ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" for middle-schoolers. Lets say its ""Home Alone for tweens. Oh never mind. What it is is an innocent comedic revenge fantasy that somehow manages to be sweet and wickedly satisfying at the same time not least because of its skewering of the weasels that run Hollywood. Whats more without uttering a single dirty word (unless you count ""dookie"" ""nutcracker"" and ""you suck"" as dirty) it is one damn - excuse me darn - funny little movie. Its so cute I wanted to pinch its cheeks except that it would probably pinch mine back. Starring that winsome little wiseacre Frankie Muniz of ""Malcolm in the Middle"" fame ""BFL"" is the story of 14-year-old Jason Shepherd a kid who can charm (read lie) his way out of anything. But when his latest (and I do mean ""late""-est) school English assignment a short story called naturally ""Big Fat Liar"" inadvertently falls into the sebaceous fingers of film producer Marty Wolf (a goateed Paul Giamatti having the sleazy time of his life) Jason is unable to convince his parents and teacher that he ever wrote it. Sentenced to the purgatory of summer school not to mention the opprobrium of parental mistrust Jason one day glimpses salvation in the form of a trailer for an upcoming film. It seems that ""Big Fat Liar"" the new picture from Wolf Productions looks suspiciously like ... Jasons story. So with his mother and father away for a long weekend Jason hits upon a plan to win back his parents confidence. With best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) along for moral support and bankrolled by a couple years worth of babysitting and lawn-mowing money Jason flies to Hollywood to humiliate Wolf into publicly fessing up. Said humiliation includes dyeing his plagiarizing nemesis blue Super-Gluing his cell phones earpiece to his head then connecting his cars brakes to the horn (did I mention that Jason is 14?). The only thing our hero didnt bargain on is the back-stabbing self-serving survival instincts of his slippery adversary. Marty turns out to give as good as he gets heedless to the fact that hes making a lot of enemies in the process including his long-suffering assistant (Amanda Detmer) his films stunt coordinator (a game Lee Majors) and everyone else who works for him. Let the games and the payback begin. Sprinkled with cameos by such footnotes in the annals of TV as Dustin Diamond (Screech in ""Saved by the Bell"") and Kenan Thompson of Nickelodeons ""Kenan and Kel"" plus a good-natured if self-deprecating appearance by the legendary Jaleel ""Urkel"" White as a cop flick star whose partner is a chicken (literally) ""BFL"" is good old-fashioned without being antique fun. Neither so trashy that youd be embarrassed to take young children nor so squeaky clean that theyll fall asleep halfway through the film teaches two valuable lessons. No. 1 The truth isnt over-rated. And No. 2 You dont have to be a potty-mouth to make people laugh. BIG FAT LIAR (PG 88 minutes) - Contains mild slapstick violence. Area theaters.

PHOTO MUST BE CREDITED  BRUCE WEBBER. HANDOUT. Photo HANDOUT FILM CLIPS / Also opening this week 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Big Fat Liar Comedy. Starring Frankie Muniz and Paul Giamatti. Directed by Shawn Levy. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Big Fat Liar"" is a comedy that follows the revenge pattern common in childrens pictures. Some flamboyantly nasty adult crosses a particularly ingenious kid and ends up sorry. This is a tired formula or at least it seems that way when it isnt done right -- as when the kid is more obnoxious than the adult or the adult however nasty isnt all that fun to watch. ""Big Fat Liar"" avoids those pitfalls. Frankie Muniz who plays the wronged kid is spunky and likable with no weird Hollywood vibe about him. And the villain is played by Paul Giamatti the wonderful comic actor who was Howard Sterns foil in ""Private Parts."" The result is a childrens movie thats almost worth seeing even when not accompanied by a child. Its certainly a painless experience and at times its quite funny. Muniz plays Jason a junior high school student with a vivid imagination who writes a story called ""Big Fat Liar"" for creative writing class. A Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Giamatti) steals the story and earmarks it to be his next film prompting young Jason and his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes) to fly to Hollywood and demand that Wolf acknowledge the theft. When he doesnt the revenge plot kicks in. Giamatti is the whole movie. With the help of screenwriter Dan Schneider who doesnt give Wolf a glimmer of kindness Giamatti creates a fine comic portrait of sublime demented and baseless self-satisfaction. Its a pleasure to watch bad things happen to him. Not only does Marty deserve it but Giamattis consistent reaction borderline hysteria also never disappoints. The pleasures dry up in the last 10 minutes and though the movie is only 90 minutes long it seems to have an extra plot loop in there. Still parents will be grateful for a childrens picture that has the capacity to amuse people older than 10. -- Mick LaSalle CHOP SUEY Documentary. Starring Peter Johnson. Directed by Bruce Weber. (Not rated. 99 minutes. At the Castro.) Fashion photographer Bruce Weber has put together an album of still photos and film clips of one of his models Peter Johnson combined with a grab bag of documentary footage. Chop suey? Make that beefcake goulash. Even though there are probably more bare chests exposed here than on a Telemundo soap opera anybody who expects this film to be nothing more than the equivalent of flipping through the advertisements in a slick magazine is in for a surprise. The film begins with a statement from Dorothea Lange about living the visual life and on three occasions Weber interrupts the proceedings for ""studio conversations"" with straight family man Johnson. In these scenes Weber shows off his private collection of photographs -- his own as well as works by George Platt Lynes Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Weston among others. The ""Chop Suey"" mix -- including saloon singer Frances Faye Brazilian jujitsu champion Rickson Gracie actors Jan-Michael Vincent and Robert Mitchum (singing) and Vogue editor Diana Vreeland -- sounds unworkable but makes some kind of sense. The models reflect the photographers fascination with straight subjects -- the art of desire not fulfillment. The eroticism comes not from having sex but from the tension of not having sex. Weber narrates in voice-over. Of a photograph by actor Roddy McDowall of Alain Delon Weber says ""I always thought this photo was about the photographer being in love with the subject."" Considerable screen time is devoted to ageless dynamo Faye in clips and in recollections by her manager-lover Teri Shepherd. Fayes presence provides an unexpected context for the photographers circle where the gay and straight worlds overlap and adds a delightful dimension to ""Chop Suey."" Advisory This film contains nudity. -- Bob Graham SHIRI Political thriller. Starring Han Suk-Gyu Kim Yun-jin. Directed by Kang Je- Gyu. (R. 124 minutes. At the Lumiere.) ""Collateral Damage"" isnt the only film about terrorism opening this week. While the Schwarzenegger movie seeks big box office ""Shiri"" an involving but ultraviolent political thriller from South Korea will test how much the art- house audience can stomach. Director Kang Je-Gyu injects intrigue paranoia and American-blockbuster style technobabble into this story of rogue North Korean commandos terrorizing Seoul. Kang is obviously skeptical of the two Koreas recent efforts at cooperation a point he underscores by mixing scenes of bloody mayhem with news reports of meetings between politicos and sports teams on both sides. Han Suk-Gyu plays a government agent haunted by a beautiful and elusive North Korean assassin. This gal can pick off good guys at will without endangering her chic manicure. She and her colleagues have stolen a batch of the South Korean governments top-secret undetectable new explosive and plan to use it at heavily populated sites around the city. The agent has slightly better luck with the other woman in his life -- his fiancee (Kim Yun-jin) a recovering alcoholic and owner of an exotic-fish store. Thats not the only thing fishy about her. The clean-cut stoic Han looks straight out of ""Law amp; Order"" but hes also squishy enough for the romantic scenes. The fish stores aquariums provide a lovely backdrop for the couples nuzzling. But these interludes dont jibe with the movies gory and overwrought shoot- em-up sequences. Though graphic violence has its place in the genre we could have done without the woman blowing herself to bits. ""Shiri"" suffers most from being overlong. Theres a neat twist subtly rendered that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes but Kang tacks on three or four more endings. Most egregious however is the films extended sentimental epilogue. While the hero might need closure the audience having waded through two hours of carnage does not. Advisory This film contains extreme violence. -- Carla Meyer Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 3 7-year-old girl dies after elephant at zoo throws a rock at her 4 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 5 Clinton speech draws mixed reaction on cable news 6 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 7 Trump Jr. accuses Obama of plagiarizing a line from his speech 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 The Latest Trump slams Clinton over radical Islam 10 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War...

You wont find many. The movie stars Frankie Muniz as Jason a scheming 14-year-old whose stolen English essay turns into fodder for an upcoming summer blockbuster with the movies conniving producer taking story credit. This leads to an adventure in which Jason gets to fly to Los Angeles and gawk at palm trees from the comfort of a luxury car drink free Coca-Cola (with the logo carefully aimed at the camera) and hide out for a few days in a fun-filled Universal Studios prop building. The overall effect is less like a childrens movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts. Jason as embodied by the perpetually eager-to-please Muniz is a theoretical construct designed to set preteen hearts palpitating. He sports all the earmarks of modern coolness including pristine skateboarding technique a great digital game box attached to the TV in his room and the charm to repeatedly address his teacher by her first name and get away with it. This kid lies so much his classmates can do little more than shake their heads and marvel at his beguiling sense of spontaneous invention. Desperate measures After getting caught in a lie -- in which he contends that he couldnt finish an important essay because his dad (Michael Bryan French) choked on a Swedish meatball -- Jason is forced to hand over the assignment in three hours or face the very uncool prospect of summer school. Out of desperation he writes a story called ""Big Fat Liar"" about a teen-ager much like himself who watches a fib spin out of control until it ruins him.

"USATODAY.com - Slimeball vs. kid in Big Fat Liar Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 02/08/2002 - Updated 0937 AM ET Slimeball vs. kid in Big Fat Liar By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Big Fat Liar (out of four) Stars Frankie Muniz Paul Giamatti Amanda Bynes Lee Majors Director Shawn Levy Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG for some language Hollywood has always been big on narcissism. The latest in this fascination with itself is the lightweight revenge comedy Big Fat Liar. Its clearly a comic fantasy of adolescent empowerment a clever pair of 14-year-olds (Frankie Muniz and Amanda Bynes) outwit and orchestrate the fall of one of Hollywoods most powerful -- and vile -- producers (Paul Giamatti). Commendably because the cute pair are only ninth-graders the movie avoids a romantic angle. Not so admirably the film feels at times like a giant commercial for Universal Studios where much of the action takes place. Read more below Related Story Malcolm is making a name for Muniz The predictable story is saved by the considerable charm of Muniz though this is not his funniest or best moment particularly when contrasted with his deft comic turns in the darkly funny Malcolm in the Middle and his more emotionally nuanced role in My Dog Skip. As Jason he has a talent for making up stories but he doesnt need to embellish one extraordinarily bad day. After his skateboard is stolen the suburban Michigan teen is forced to tote a crucial essay to school on his sisters pink bike. Hes knocked off his wheels by Marty Wolf the megalomaniacal power-hound. Producers probably dont ride around solo in limos scouting locations so far from Hollywood but the device allows for a cute meeting between a glib kid and a successful slimeball. When Jason accidentally leaves his term paper behind in Wolfs limo his teacher and parents dont believe him making him literally the boy who cried ""Wolf"" A few months later when he sees a trailer for a movie called Big Fat Liar the title of his paper Jason persuades his buddy (Bynes) to hop on a plane with him hellbent on getting Wolf to acknowledge that he stole the story. His parents are gone for the weekend so Jason must track down Wolf in two days. The movie aheres to the revenge slapstick formula. Giamatti as Wolf is so irredeemably despicable that its hard to believe he could exist even in Hollywood. In Storytelling his talents are put to better use as a down-on-his-luck documentarian the opposite of his role here. It also strains credulity that a sharp kid like Jason would make restoring his honest reputation his only goal. Wouldnt he try to get compensated for writing a summer blockbuster? But perhaps theyre trying to let the unsuspecting public in on a little-known secret Most big summer movies are actually written by 14-year-olds.

That premise probably says more about the way that bad comedies get packaged these days than the creators of Big Fat Liar intended. To prove that hes an upright kid after all Jason journeys to the West Coast and proceeds to humiliate the producer into owning up to his theft. He does this primarily by filling the scoundrels swimming pool and shampoo tube with brightly colored ink thus setting up the central ""gag"" of this noisy frantic dud Paul Giamatti with blue skin and orange hair racing around L.A. in the kind of bug-eyed apoplectic sputter that no actor has done half as well as Curly Howard. How appealing is Muniz taking a break from ""Malcolm in the Middle"" a day job he should by no means let go of? Lets call him the next-generation Fred Savage.
