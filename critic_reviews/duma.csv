Beautifully directed by ""Black Stallion"" and ""Fly Away Home"" veteran Carroll Ballard ""Duma"" fell flat in the United States because of bad timing and abysmal marketing. Maybe they should have called it ""A Boy and His Cheetah"" but no matter -- it took in less than a million dollars across the country. Busy or jaded critics rarely champion movies targeted at children and ""Duma"" jumps the genres by refusing to pander. Its lyrical shots of forbidding and foreboding African spaces appeal to adults as much as the boy-and-cat story draws in children so ""Duma"" got stuck. No reason to mourn though because its a steady favorite on DVD rotation and well worth exposing your children to. Sit down and watch with them as young Xan loses his father and gains a cheetah. Duma the safari cat loses his mother in a chilling opening scene pitting lion against cheetah. Xan raises Duma at home and the lean compact energy of the cheetahs body draws the camera lens everywhere Duma moves. When Xans widowed mother must move to the city Xan strikes out cross-country with Duma to return the big cat to the wilderness where he was born. He links up with a possibly friendly potentially dangerous roustabout named Ripkuna (Eamonn Walker) and they flee across desert and down river. Their trip evokes many old legends not the least of which is ""Huckleberry Finn."" Racial tensions play subtly in the movie with Xan from a relatively privileged background and Ripkuna wary of all white faces. See if your kids make any of these connections -- there are also plenty of visual references to Ballards own movies including the wondrous ""Black Stallion.""

The cheetah grows up on their secluded family ranch and everyones happy - until father ups and dies forcing Xan his mother and the big cat to move to the city. Unhappy from day one Xan soon absconds with Duma and heads back into the wilderness where a chance meeting with a nomadic ex-convict provides some filmic tension and a lesson in family values. Hard to believe this well-meaning animal adventure was directed by the usually competent Ballard. In contrast to Fly Away Home Duma is hamstrung by erratic editing poor continuity frigid performances and a story so predictable you can foresee the outcome by looking at the poster. Still it looks suitably lush and the stringently rationed footage of the big cat at full stretch will bring a lump to the throat of any animal fan.

"In Duma journey to the wild rings true - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In Duma journey to the wild rings true By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  March 14 2006 One of the best family movies of 2005 -- actually one of last years best films period -- is finally opening in Massachusetts today. Unfortunately youll have to drive to Worcester to see it.Duma"" is an exquisitely filmed emotionally transfixing epic about a white South African boys journey to return his pet cheetah to the wild. It was made by Carroll Ballard the former cinematographer whose films as director -- The Black Stallion"" in 1979 Never Cry Wolf"" in 1983 Fly Away Home"" in 1996 -- are among the greatest modern movies about the relationship between man and animals. Duma"" is no different Ballard gives us nature in all its vast dangerous glory and then asks us to ponder where tame"" ends and wild"" begins in ourselves and in the animals we think we know.Yet Warner Brothers has thrown the film away releasing it in haphazard limited engagements throughout 2005 and never giving it the publicity push it deserves. (It will be released on DVD in May.) Their loss is all I can say. Duma"" is too suspenseful for the youngest children but for anyone older than 8 or 9 it evokes nothing less than awe at the harsh beauty of the natural world.Delight too when the tiny baby cheetah is rescued from the middle of a rural highway by a South African farmer (Campbell Scott) and his 12-year-old son Xander (Alexander Michaletos). The cubs mother has been dispatched (off-screen) by a lion and the human family -- Hope Davis plays Xans mother -- takes him in names him Duma"" (Swahili for cheetah) and treats him as you would a stray housecat. An increasingly large housecat.These scenes are adorable but trouble hovers just outside the movies frame and eventually it lands. Just as hes preparing to re-introduce Duma to the wild the father dies of a heart attack (again discreetly) and mother and son have to move to the city. I dont know what sort of no pets"" clauses they have in South Africa but Duma does not adapt well. Xan takes it upon himself to complete his fathers plan and swiping the old mans motorcycle runs away into the endless unforgiving African horizon. Duma goes in the sidecar.Heres where the movie proper begins and it bears a slight resemblance to the old Nicolas Roeg film Walkabout."" The trek crosses salt flats deserts wooded jungles and crocodile-infested rivers -- by motorcycle by parasail on foot and by raft. The threat of death is real and omnipresent yet Xan is resourceful and hes soon joined by another returning wanderer in the person of Ripkuna (Eamonn Walker of HBOs Oz"") an escaped convict hoping to find redemption in his tribal village.Xan doesnt trust the older man at first and neither do we but by the time the two are pranking a tourist safari to get at the catering theyve come to an understanding. Ripkuna is called on to deliver the screenplays life lessons and if these are on the fuzzy side theyre given true heft by the physically stunning surroundings. The climax with Xan risking his life to save Ripkunas is more eloquent than anything the characters actually say to each other.Ballard and his cameraman Werner Maritz turn the South African landscape into a place beyond history or human culture a world before the fall. There be lions here -- and baboons elephants hippos and rhinos -- and they are defiantly un-cute. Nor is Duma anthropomorphized into a cuddly stand-in for human emotions. The director knows the cat is the mystery at the heart of his tale and by the end of Duma"" Xan knows it too.So do we. Unlike so many movies we feed our children -- Chicken Little"" Madagascar"" Shaggy Dog"" -- Duma"" dares to treat animals as animals and young viewers as grown-ups. No wonder it couldnt find an audience. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Alex Michaletos makes his movie debut in ""Duma"" about a boy who sets out to return the cheetah he raised from a cub to the wilds of South Africa. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Duma"" with Alex Michaletos Eamonn Walker Hope Davis Campbell Scott. Directed by Carroll Ballard from a screenplay by Karen Janszen and Mark St. Germain based on the book ""How It Was With Dooms"" by Carol Cawthra Hopcraft and Xan Hopcraft. 100 minutes. Rated PG for mild adventure peril. Northwest Film Forum. In a gross miscarriage of movie justice Warner Bros. put Carroll Ballards exceptional family film ""Duma"" in distribution limbo aborting its wide theatrical release after capriciously deciding it wasnt commercial enough. This says more about the cowardice of Hollywood studios than the wonderful quality of ""Duma"" which has been rescued from local obscurity by Northwest Film Forums adventurous ""Cinema K"" programming for children. Warner Bros. is at least allowing interested parties to book it independently. How Warner Bros. could neglect a new film by the director of ""The Black Stallion"" ""Never Cry Wolf"" and ""Fly Away Home"" is beyond comprehension. If nothing else Ballards track record would make ""Duma"" a safe bet for at least limited release and a long life on DVD is virtually guaranteed. Set in the harsh beautifully photographed wilderness of South Africa much of the film involves the recklessly boyish efforts of 12-year-old Xan (played by newcomer Alex Michaletos) to return his pet cheetah Duma to the wild. Found as a cub the now full-grown Duma is at risk in big-city Johannesburg. So without telling his mother (Hope Davis) Xan treks into the dangerous Kalahari Desert following the advice of his farmer father (Campbell Scott) to return Duma to his instinctive place in nature. Xan is joined on his journey by Ripkuna (Eamonn Walker the volatile dictator in ""Lord of War"") an enigmatic wanderer on a mission of his own. As always Ballard is singularly fascinated by the mysterious bond between humans and animals and his supreme patience yields hypnotic images that no other director would think to include. ""Duma"" bears partial resemblance to 2004s tiger-cub adventure ""Two Brothers"" but this elemental true-life tale of a boy and his cheetah (based on the book ""How It Was With Dooms"" by Xan Hopcraft and his mother Carol Cawthra Hopcraft) has far more riches to offer in its wise embrace of natural wonders. With ravenous alligators and lions on the prowl ""Duma"" delivers familiar adventure but Ballard refuses to cater to cuteness. This lack of artifice -- the very quality that makes ""Duma"" unique -- is probably what caused Warner Bros. to make its decision. Perhaps theyd have preferred a computer-animated ""Duma"" with lucrative plush-toy licensing. Thankfully Ballard made a film of longer-lasting value.

Directed by Carroll Ballard. With Alexander Michaletos Campbell Scott Hope Davis and Eamonn Walker. (Rated PG. 100 minutes. At the Balboa in San Francisco Rafael Film] Center in San Rafael and Elmwood in Berkeley.) Family films can be simplistic or condescending but the joy of Carroll Ballards work is that its neither. In films such as ""The Black Stallion"" and ""Fly Away Home"" the director has offered humanistic and visually extraordinary coming-of-age stories about young people with animal companions. He carries on the tradition nicely with ""Duma"" about a South African boy who runs away from home to return his pet cheetah to the wild. Its a superior adventure film with a poetic heart. Duma (Swahili for ""cheetah"") is the name given to the orphaned baby animal found by 12-year-old Xan (Alexander Michaletos) and his rancher father (Campbell Scott). The cheetah whose cry is more of an endearing squeak grows to adulthood as a family pet. But circumstances force Xan and his mom (Hope Davis) to move to Johannesburg which the boy quickly realizes is no place for an animal that can weigh 250 pounds and run more than 60 miles per hour. Xans also having a rough time at his new school. He borrows his dads old motorcycle puts Duma in the sidecar and takes off intending to free the animal in a distant wildlife reserve. Gas stations being scarce in the Kalahari desert Xan and Duma soon find themselves on foot. Crossing salt flats and sand dunes they take shelter in a downed airplane where they encounter a wandering black man Ripkuna (Eamonn Walker) who has water. Theres mutual suspicion and eventually the man offers to help Xan. But whats his real motive? (A tame cheetah we learn can be sold for a lot of money and surely there would be a reward for returning the boy home.) There are obstacles and dangers in the form of thirst storms predators a massive tsetse fly infestation and an abandoned diamond mine. Ripkuna reveals that he left a wife and child behind in his village while he sought his fortune in the big city where things didnt work out. ""Duma"" has some terrific set pieces -- theres a great sequence about how the characters get the motorcycle moving again and an intense scene where they desperately try to light a fire in the rain to frighten off marauding lions. The film addresses broad themes -- parent-child relationships the inevitability of change finding ones true nature -- but also glances at the social realities of a troubled nation. Ballard a Bay Area resident (he has a vineyard in St. Helena) was a college classmate of Frances Ford Coppola who produced ""The Black Stallion."" Besides directing Ballard has worked as a cinematographer and his films show it. For several of his movies he was fortunate to have Caleb Deschanel behind the camera. With ""Duma"" he turned to first-timer Werner Maritz who proves an able successor. The films vision of nature is resonant. ""Duma"" is based on the 1997 book ""How It Was With Dooms A True Story From Africa"" by photographer Carol Cawthra Hopcraft and Xan Hopcraft. -- Advisory The depiction of some of the dangers faced by the characters may be too intense for young children.

"Master filmmakers adept touch turns the familiar into the cats meow - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Dad Master filmmakers adept touch turns the familiar into the cats meowmovies - reviewDecember 9 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticDuma is a story about a boy and his cheetah.Yes its another ""kid-lost-in-the-wild"" adventure. Yes Disney did something like this called Cheetah in 1989 and even Reese Witherspoon started her career way back when with the similar A Far Off Place in 1993.But this is a movie by Carroll Ballard who did Fly Away Home and The Black Stallion. Ballard is the master at putting kids and animals through their paces often in the most photogenic places imaginable. From first frame to last Duma is the work of a guy who knows what hes doing with this sort of material.A cheetah mom is killed in a fight with a lion. One of her cubs wanders off and a South African boy and his dad (Campbell Scott) find him.The kitten becomes a part of the family. Mom indulges the kid. They name the cat Duma Swahili for cheetah. Were treated to shots of the cat growl-purring under the covers with Xan (Alex Michaeletos) sleeping with the chickens playing with a TV remote control and eventually being a kitty in the city.But Dad wants to send him back to nature.""His wildness is something that he knows without even knowing it"" Dad says. ""Its in his bones.""But Dad is sick and soon it is up to Xan to trek off to deliver Duma to the dry savanna where he belongs. He bumps into another wanderer Rip played by wonderful character actor Eamonn Walker of Lord of War. Rip is an aimless tramp far from home. And once they get past the whole South African racial-tensions thing they can get down to the serious business of mistrusting one another. Xan worries Rip will turn him in for a reward and Duma over to zoo trappers for more cash. And Rip is forever fretting over being spotted by the law.Ballard wonderfully captures the vast expanses of desert wasteland -- desert scenery never looks better than in his films. In adapting this book by Xan Hopcraft Ballard dips into his bag of animal-photography tricks and even revives a stunt he used in his sailboat-racing flop Wind.The acting is solid and the quest has a compact sweetness about it without ever dipping into that Disney ""circle of life"" cliche. Duma has a journey to complete and he has to learn his wilderness trade too.""Chase trip and bite"" as Dad puts it.But Xan is traveling too from childhood to manhood. And even Rip has a destination.Ballard gets laughs where hes supposed to and thrills in all the right places. Kids especially those who have never seen a movie raft go over a waterfall or crocodiles gulp down waterfowl will get a kick out of this.

Warner Bros. has decided to show this poetically epic film by director Carroll Ballard (The Black Stallion) on only a few screens under the assumption that if there are no special effects or animation kids and their parents wont go see it. But unlike many lesser movies aimed at families this has heart humor thrilling adventure and stunning visuals. Set in South Africa the cinematography is breathtaking and the action expertly directed by the filmmaker behind such top-notch films as Never Cry Wolf (1983) Fly Away Home (1996) and 1979s haunting Stallion. About the movie Duma    1/2 (out of four) Stars Campbell Scott Hope Davis Alexander Michaletos Eamonn Walker Director Carroll Ballard Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for mild adventure peril Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles The film centers on Duma a sleek cheetah who chirps instead of yowls and Xan the boy who loves him (Alexander Michaletos). Based on a true story Xan leads a charmed life on his familys ranch until his father (Campbell Scott) dies leaving his mother (Hope Davis) unable to care for their farm. Mother son and Duma move to Johannesburg. In the only clunky scene the cheetah bolts. Xan takes off after him planning to lead him back to the wild as he and his father had planned. Newcomer Michaletos is engaging and Eamonn Walker who plays Ripkuna Xans fellow traveler plays his part with flair. This is precisely the kind of film that parents clamor for and rarely get a substantive stirring Huck Finn-style saga that doesnt insult anyones intelligence or mindlessly entertain with crass humor. Hollywood execs might just consider making more if audiences would embrace them. So do yourself -and future movie audiences -- a favor and do see Duma.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Duma David Bloomer) B Duma Genre Drama; Starring Alex Michaeletos Campbell Scott Hope Davis; Director Carroll Ballard; Author Karen Janszen Mark St. Germain; Release Date Limited 09/30/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 110; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted September 28 2005 -- 1200 AM EDT Years after his two great close encounters with the natural world The Black Stallion (1979) and Never Cry Wolf (1983) director Carroll Ballard still works in his ravishing nearly pointillistic style of organic visual splendor. Yawning apes a sun-blasted jungle vista an attack by crocodiles In Duma adapted from the popular childrens book How It Was With Dooms images like these appear just as splendid and strange as they should. Ballard connects you to the beauteous inner calm of the wild even if audiences today are looking for a lot less calm. Xan (Alex Michaeletos) a boy growing up on a farm in South Africa adopts an orphaned cheetah cub and must return the grown-up predator to the wilderness plains. The journey at once wondrous and cute (Xan buddies up with a wayward tribesman played by the feisty Eamonn Walker) has passages of enchantment but youre always aware of how much the prosaicness of the tale lags behind the poetry of the telling.

With Alex Michaeletos Campbell Scott. (100 min.)Ballard (""The Black Stallion"") has such a powerful feeling for the poetry of movement that I would have been content if this movie about a runaway boy and his pet cheetah had simply shown us two hours of the cheetah. Ballard filmed across hundreds of miles of South African desert and there are times when the whole throbbing universe seems to resound for him. Duma is ostensibly a childrens movie but adults will want to see it too. (Opens in Los Angeles and New York.) Grade A-- Peter RainerInto the Blue (PG-13)Director John Stockwell. With Paul Walker Jessica Alba Scott Caan. (110 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Four friends searching for a sunken shipwreck in the Bahamas get mixed up with a drug cartel. The film poses ethical dilemmas but leaves the viewer annoyed when characters continually make foolish decisions. Full of scantily-clad women and gore its only redeeming value is Sams (Alba) sense of morality amid the corruption. Grade C- Jennifer Moeller Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Mirrormask (PG)Director Dave McKean. With Stephanie Leonidas Rob Brydon. (101 min.)Helena (Leonidas) wishes she could run away from her family circus and ""join real life."" Like ""Alice in Wonderland"" her odyssey spirals her through a series of increasingly dark fantasias. Unlike Lewis Carrolls Alice the wit and invention often flags. This hodgepodge of special and not-so-special effects is the brainchild of Neil Gaiman the wildly successful comic-book writer and graphic novelist (""Sandman"" ""Violent Cases"" ""Coraline"") and multimedia artist David McKean his frequent collaborator making his feature directing debut with this Jim Henson Company production. At best Helenas wiggy adventures recall such Jean Cocteau films as ""Orpheus"" and ""Blood of a Poet."" At worst they resemble the Vegas act of Cirque du Soleil. Grade B- P.R.

Confidently blending the elements that have traditionally served Ballard well -- kids animals and epic landscapes -- this intelligent beautifully made production is a welcome reprieve from such crass (if successful) family pics as ""Are We There Yet?"" and ""The Pacifier."" The sixth feature (and first since 1996s ""Fly Away Home"") directed by Carroll Ballard ""Duma"" reps a superior all-ages adventure pic made by a filmmaker who knows more than a thing or two about the genre. Confidently blending the elements that have traditionally served Ballard well -- kids animals and epic landscapes -- this intelligent beautifully made production is a welcome reprieve from such crass (if successful) family pics as ""Are We There Yet?"" and ""The Pacifier."" Perhaps for that very reason Warner Bros. is approaching pics release with kid gloves giving ""Duma"" a three-city ""test"" run (in Sacramento Phoenix and San Antonio) that began April 22 and booking several fest appearances but otherwise remaining uncommitted as to pics future. Warners apparent uncertainty about ""Duma"" recalls the studios hesitant distribution of another kidpic from a decade ago Alfonso Cuarons ""A Little Princess"" (1995) which was ultimately reissued amid much critical clamor and went on to earn several Oscar nominations. Like that film ""Duma"" seems certain to garner strong reviews and enthusiastic word of mouth wherever it surfaces and with proper support could find a devoted audience despite its lack of star wattage and its preference for those special effects generated by nature rather than computers. A classical tale of a boy and his dog -- only with a cheetah standing in for the dog -- ""Duma"" was inspired by true events in the lives of wildlife photographer Carol Cawthra Hopcraft and her son Xan whose 1997 book ""How It Was with Dooms"" chronicled the familys experience living with a domesticated cheetah on their South African farm. From those factual if not particularly dramatic seeds Ballard and screenwriters Karen Janszen and Mark St. Germain have embellished a stirring Kipling-esque yarn filled with perilous desert crossings the forging of unlikely allegiances and the getting of hard-earned wisdom. When young Xan (12-year-old newcomer Alexander Michaletos) and his father (Campbell Scott) rescue an abandoned cheetah cub the animal (named Duma the Swahili word for cheetah) quickly becomes an adopted member of the family. But as viewers of films from ""Born Free"" to ""Free Willy"" know there comes a time when a beloved wild pet must be returned to its natural habitat. Hastening that inevitability is the sudden death of Xans father which forces Xans mother (Hope Davis) to lease the farm and move to a city apartment that is like a bleak fortress of concrete and glass. But Xan remains determined to escort Duma into the wild himself and soon makes a daring desert escape armed with a map a passenger motorbike and a woefully inadequate plan of action. Broken down in the middle of the Kalaharis vast salt pans without adequate food or water Xan and Duma take refuge in the shell of a crashed airplane. The arrival of another lost traveler a tribesman named Rip (powerful British actor Eamonn Walker) is hardly the miracle theyre hoping for. Following his own agenda that includes searching abandoned diamond mines for discarded booty and possibly turning Xan and Duma over to the authorities for a reward Rip earns Xans (and the audiences) trust only reluctantly and with great uncertainty at that. As this misfit trio rely on their wits to survive a series of ravishing set-pieces ensues including the transformation of Xans stalled motorcycle into a zooming wind-powered dune buggy and the crossing of a rapid crocodile-infested stream on a rickety homemade raft. And though ""Duma"" is engaging from the start its in these scenes that the film really takes flight. Like Ballards best pics (""The Black Stallion"" ""Never Cry Wolf"") the movie is marked by ecstatic depictions of figures against a treacherously beautiful landscape and by its ability to engage the imaginations of the young and young-at-heart without ever insulting their collective intelligence. Indeed in every way that a lesser filmmaker might have allowed ""Duma"" to slip into convention Ballard defies expectations. The character of Rip who could easily have been offered as an obvious ally or a form of comic relief is instead rendered as a complex human being whose fundamentally good nature is compromised by the forbidding socioeconomics of contemporary African tribal life. And rather than turning a blind eye to such harsh realities as poverty and the exploitation of diamond-mine workers Ballard makes them as much a part of pics landscape as the blinding dust storms and oceans of tall dry grass. Discovered by the filmmakers following an exhaustive casting search native South African Michaletos proves a screen natural in a demanding role that requires him to be on screen for nearly every scene and to appear comfortable interacting with a host of exotic wildlife. Scott and Davis playing a happier married couple than they did in ""The Secret Lives of Dentists"" adopt spot-on South African accents and fittingly rustic lived-in personas. But not surprisingly its the animal performers (under the supervision of vet trainer Jules Sylvester) who steal the show particularly the four adult cheetahs who interchangeably play the title role. Physically grueling production lensed on some 75 locations throughout South Africa has been superbly rendered by production designer Johnny Breedt and costumer Jayne Forbes. Making his debut as a feature cinematographer longtime gaffer Werner Maritz shows an extraordinary eye for the rich earth tones and delicate shifts of light that compose the desert palette though some early interior shots suffered from a milky washed-out quality on print screened.
