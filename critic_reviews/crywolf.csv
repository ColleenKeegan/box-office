This perhaps explains how the production won a million-dollar prize from a US auto manufacturer but it still comes across as a cumulatively tiresome exercise in story mechanics as bored students at an exclusive Virginia academy react to the recent slaying of a local townie by pretending their classmates are the killers next target group e-mailing an invented case history as a mass scare tactic. However when the supposed psycho returns their on-line messages and one of their number disappears it looks like their lies might be coming worryingly true. Sundry red herrings and ever-shifting guilt make the story more Agatha Christie than Wes Craven but as the obviously over-age cast prove exasperatingly dim-witted while trading smart-aleck dialogue the power of suggestion takes us only so far before patience wears thin.

""His buddy list reads like the sex offenders registry"" snipes one prep schooler of another. Ha ha kids these...wait what? Director Jeff Wadlows thriller is 10 parts sass to 1 part sense with twists more self-consciously contorted than a yuppie yoga retreat. The characters -- bored rich snots at a suspiciously understaffed private academy passing time by using the sinister Internet to invent a serial killer (who might already exist) -- are nothing but walking attitudes. But even with the wires showing and the Screams of yesteryear ringing in our ears Cry_Wolf is underscored with idiot adolescent excitement (and gets extra absurdist points for casting Jon Bon Jovi as an educator).

Photo Romeo Tirone Killer rumor takes a murderous turn 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Cry Wolf Thriller. Starring Julian Morris Lindy Booth Jared Padalecki and Jon Bon Jovi. Directed by Jeff Wadlow. (PG-13 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When a movie isnt prescreened for critics it usually means studios want to ambush audiences and take their money before someone warns them. Mainstream movies that dont get screenings are almost never slightly bad. Theyre ""Alien vs. Predator"" bad. Which makes ""Cry Wolf"" something of a phenomenon. Not only is it kind-of-sort-of-almost good but its also arguably the best horror movie in theaters right now -- thanks to a decent script with a couple of great twists. The setup is pretty simple Think ""Dead Poets Society"" with ritual murders. Owen (Julian Morris) is a newcomer at a boarding school where he meets the mischievous Dodger (Lindy Booth) who likes to sneak out and play late night games with schoolmates in a campus church. After a local girl goes missing the students invent a story about a serial killer. Pretty soon the tale starts coming true -- Owen gets weird e-mails an orange ski mask-wearing bad guy is spotted on campus and people start disappearing. ""Cry Wolf"" takes too long to set up has some serious plausibility problems and doesnt always make sense. But director Jeff Wadlow deserves a lot of credit for avoiding cheap thrills. While most horror film directors focus on creative new ways to eviscerate people Wadlow has crafted a film with almost no gratuitous gore. His sole focus is to keep the audience guessing -- and then proving them wrong in the end. Jon Bon Jovi shows up in the Robin Williams role and while hes much too hot to play a journalism professor he stands out in a mostly decent supporting cast. ""Cry Wolf"" also manages to weave current picture phone and PDA technology into the plot without seeming gimmicky. The violence and gore is almost too benign especially for a PG-13 horror movie. Take out a few bad words and some allusions to underage sex and this could play on network television on Halloween. But its not a bad film even if it took a few extra days for someone to let you know. -- Advisory This film contains violence and mild sexual innuendos. Bon Jovi fans should be warned While the singers hair remains feathered to perfection for the role ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" just wont sound the same after you see him in a tweed jacket with leather elbow patches.

"Light on gore and suspense Wolf is all claws and no bite - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Light on gore and suspense Wolf is all claws and no bite By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  September 17 2005 Cry Wolf"" is a sheep in wolfs clothing a mystery-thriller disguised as a routine dice-and-slice teen horror flick. Give it points for trying something different -- and then take them back for botching the job. This is after all a movie in which nubile young women say things like Im all congested from crying. Im going to take a shower; the steam might help.""After an opening scene in which a terrified girl is butchered in a nighttime forest -- a sequence contractually stipulated by California state law to appear in all movies marketed to teenagers -- the setting shifts to nearby Westlake Preparatory Academy. The school resembles a kinder gentler Hogwarts and the students are all rich bored and in their mid-to-late 20s.New kid Owen (young UK heartthrob Julian Morris obliging Gary Cole to adopt a British accent as his distant dad) arrives at Westlake on double secret probation from other schools and quickly falls in with the bad kids. And a multi-culti group they are punker Randall (Jesse Janzen) Asian-American Regina (Kristy Wu) Latina hottie Mercedes (Sandra McCoy) Afro-Am Lewis (Paul James) Graham the nerd (Ethan Cohn) and Owens roommate Tom (Jared Padalecki) who hails from the country of Biganddumb. Owen has eyes only for Dodger (Lindy Booth Dawn of the Dead"") a slim bottle-redhead with a penchant for mind games.Said games begin with an after-hours round of Murder"" (some of you know it as Mafia"") in the school chapel then turn ambitious when the group decides to freak out the entire student body. Taking the recent murder as a starting point they concoct a serial killer The Wolf"" and send out a mass e-mail that details his past crimes.Wouldnt you know it? The Wolf turns out to be real and he prefers to be his own publicist.At least thats how it appears from the spooky instant messages that keep popping up on Owens computer and from the gotcha"" shots of a hulking figure in an orange ski mask (who may be a Mexican wrestler whos lost his way; its not clear). But even as the heros friends start disappearing faster than you can say Ten Little Diverse Ethnic Representatives"" Cry Wolf"" is suspiciously light on gore and dismemberment. Is the PG-13 rating to blame or is it something more . . . sinister? Either way hardened fans of movie splatter may be tossing their Big Gulps at the screen in contempt.Director Jeff Wadlow tries to goose the proceedings with a few tricky camera moves that will go straight to his clip reel and to his credit he and cowriter Beau Bauman throw enough curveballs to keep the target audience guessing. (Seasoned veterans on the other hand will be able to spot the killer within 10 minutes.) More amusing is the way technology blows up in the characters faces from those threatening IMs to a cellphone that inadvertently takes a picture of the killer. But perhaps people too stupid to remove their iPod headphones while investigating scary noises deserve whatever they get.For grown-ups Cry Wolf"" is notable mostly for the appearances of rocker Jon Bon Jovi as a shifty journalism teacher and actress/playwright/performance artist Anna Deavere Smith as the school headmistress. Shes not the first MacArthur Foundation genius to appear in a junky B-flick -- John Sayless appearance in 1978s Piranha"" gets the nod for that -- but shes certainly the most shame-free.

This review was updated on September 20 2005. Targeting the more traditional-minded horror-slasher-thriller fan -- the one who prefers the old Wes Craven to the Craven of ""Red Eye"" for instance -- ""Cry Wolf"" is almost totally reliant on red herrings and the viewers nervous reflexes. Auds anxious to relish the imperilment of appealing teens gave the stand-issue shocker a mild 4.4 million opening weekend indicating a short road to homevid. Its not that director/co-writer Jeff Wadlow doesnt have a sense of humor or genre At one point his ethnically balanced band of practical-joking high schoolers almost leave their prep school for somebodys lake house -- the fact they dont is a joke meant for the hardcore fan base. But genre eventually overwhelms ingenuity. Our hero so to speak is English-accented Owen (Julian Morris) frequent transfer student -- due to various offenses which include having dated the previous deans daughter. His current encounter is with the saucy Dodger (Lindy Booth). While Booth slinks through the movie like a 3/4-scale Nicole Kidman Morris seems to think hes in an episode of ""Brideshead Revisited."" Not that this is bad Theyre enough unlike the characters found in similar movies as to inspire hope the rest of the film will be half as novel. Its not to be. The rest of the cast meets the standard social criteria for the mayhem movie Tom the quasi-Neanderthal football player and Owens roommate (Jared Padalecki); Mercedes the slow-witted sexpot (Sandra McCoy); Randall the abusive and apparently Anglophobic piercing enthusiast (Jesse Janzen); Lewis the black guy (Paul James) and Regina the Asian girl (Kristy Wu). There are surprises intrinsic to the storyline in which the group concocts a scheme to link a recent local murder to a supposed serial killer. Via email Dodger and Owen manufacture an m.o. for their killer -- all of which suddenly starts coming true. Is the murderer one of them? Is he the seemingly decent journalism teacher Mr. Walker (a very decent Jon Bon Jovi)? Or is it ... someone else? Theres not enough tension to make the viewer care that muchfor the various hoaxes and faux-slayings perpetrated by the films largely unlikable gang of privileged brats. In an era of increasingly sophisticated thrillers ""Cry Wolf"" is a bit antique. Cry WolfProductionA Rogue Pictures release of a Hypnotic Prods. film. Produced by Beau Bauman.
