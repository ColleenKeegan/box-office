Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Miranda Julys second feature The Future the quirky performance artist casts herself as a dance teacher who has difficulty dancing when shes by herself because whenever she starts to move her head she gets distracted by the fine details of the room around her and whenever she starts to move her body so many possibilities open up that she freezes. Thats also a fair description of Julys filmmaking which is preoccupied with the minuscule almost to the point of being trifling. Julys debut feature Me And You And Everyone We Know for example contrasted people in real pain with emotionally stunted ninnies and seemed to hold both in distressingly equal regard. On the surface The Future seems eminently mockable. July stars opposite Hamish Linklater (from the underrated sitcom The New Adventures Of Old Christine and not incidentally a July look-alike) who plays her equally immobile boyfriend. When the couple agrees to adopt a sickly cat with a wounded paw--a cat that narrates its own scenes--they worry that even this small amount of responsibility will impede their ability to do all the awesome things they currently arent doing. So they decide to make the most of the remaining month while the kitty is convalescing at the shelter. They quit their jobs disconnect the Internet and pledge to remain open to whatever the universe throws at them. The Futures main characters are undeniably dopes. But July and Linklater turn their ineptitude into a funny running joke which becomes surprisingly affecting in the second half as July decides to jump-start her life by having an affair with a wealthy suburbanite while Linklater decides to freeze time. (It makes sense in context.) The Future is full of amusing lovely little moments that are just a degree removed from being too cute whether July is being stalked by her favorite comfy shirt or following a little girls plan to sleep in a hole to its logical endpoint. The Future is elliptical but never shaggy. July is focused throughout mediating on movement--the seduction and fear of it--while encouraging the audience to care about a pair of do-nothings who like to preserve the broken. Theres even a creeping level of tension in the movie as July and Linklater decide what to do when its their relationship thats busted. Do they toss it out? Or just tape up the frayed wires and get a few more not entirely satisfying years out of it? In Julys constrained world the resolution to that question qualifies as a nail-biter.

"The Future (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Future (R) Surreal dramedy about a couple trying to kick-start their relationship lets you answer your own questions Share Print Save to your profile By Colin Covert Star Tribune8/26/2011 Editor rating 3 The surreal dramedy The Future gives us a pair of characters who face it nervously. Sophie (writer/director Miranda July) is a childrens dance teacher too self-conscious to shed her inhibitions and cut loose. When she vows to create 30 YouTube dance clips in 30 days shes petrified with performance anxiety. Her boyfriend Jason (Hamish Linklater) a computer-support techie seems more plugged in to the unseen clients who call the couples apartment with glitches. The mid-30ish couple is together in name only intertwining their legs when they share the sofabut focused on their individual laptops. To test their flagging romance they decide to adopt an ailing sheltercat. Their visit to the shelter unexpectedly changes the characters horizons. Instead of a renewed commitment they find uncertainty after uncertainty.If you are familiar with Julys imaginative world from her acclaimed short stories or her captivating 2005 Cannes triumph Me and You and Everyone We Know it will not surprise you that the cat Paw-Paw narrates parts of the story. July provides the felines scratchy-squeaky voice which is fitting. Paw-Paws sighing monologues of yearning and disappointment in the shelter mirror Sophies mental state of chipper despair. The actors are quite engaging in their mopey way. July brings a tentative neediness to her character; you can almost see an ""Adopt Me"" sign around her neck. Linklater so physically similar to his lanky mop-haired costar that they could be siblings expresses his longing and doubt about their romance through tiny meticulously observed physical giveaways. When Jason gives Sophie the side eye you know theyre in trouble without a word being exchanged. There are laughs in this story of disconnected people. July doesnt deal in knee-slappers but droll off-kilter moments of absurd insight. Her vignettes are living New Yorker cartoons. Sophie imagines her life slipping away during a sign-up session at the childrens dance studio her clients evolving through an entire life cycle while she remains stuck at the reception desk. Like Paw-Paw shes waiting for someone to rescue her. Jason distraught at the idea of a breakup discovers he has the power to freeze time and desperately puts their separation on hold. Then he wanders through a nighttime Los Angeles made beautiful by suspended animation. With a thousand odd details July builds a story with a surprising emotional wallop. By the finale the fate of that shelter cat will have you by the throat. What does it all mean? Your guess is as good as mine. July expects each of us to puzzle out the significance on our own. Julys falling-out-of-love story is a perplexing haunting concoction of whimsy sadness and beauty. Cast Miranda July Hamish Linklater. Writer-director Miranda July. Producers Gina Kwon Gerhard Meixner Roman Paul. A Roadside Attractions release. Running time 91 minutes. Sexual situations adult themes. Opens Friday Aug. 26 in Miami-Dade Regal South Beach; in Palm Beach Shadowood.

July still looking every bit the Manga cartoon pixie brought to life stars as an awkward impulsive dance instructor who takes leave of her directionless look-a-likey boyfriend (Hamish Linklater) to have a strange affair (more a piece of flirtatious ad-infinitum role-playing) with a balding suburban widower. To add that proceedings are narrated by an ailing helium-voiced cat should clarify that unlike her previous indie hit Me and You and Everyone We Know (2005) this is a piece of all-out experimentation. One reading of this gratifyingly open film is that even though it embraces a surface level kook its also about the art of (and emotional strain that comes with) maintaining a kooky facade. Kook in quote marks if you will. Not a crowd-pleaser by any measure but a mature bold and recklessly inquisitive film however unpleasant it is to consume in the moment.

Its a shame because there were some interesting moments particularly around the central male character - but Miranda Julys character was so dim and feeble and horrible and ridiculous and pathetic and incomprehensible and slow and odd that it was impossible to engage with the film. Why on earth would anyone care what happened to her? ANNOYINGFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 10 2011SteveFeaturedThere is something irritatingly profound about this film which stays with you long after the final frame. Maybe the irritating bit is the couple themselves whose decision to adopt a cat leads to a relationship crisis; maybe its the fey and gamine Miranda July herself so twee she sometimes makes you want to throw up; maybe its the idea of a movie centred on a two unconvincing puppet feet and someone (probably the director herself) giving us an dreadful version of how a cat would talk. But this is IS still a profound.film a haunting sometimes chilling attempt at confronting life in its metaphysical context. And lets be honest you dont see movies like that every day. I loved it.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Love fable. Not rated. 1 hour 31 minutes. At the Esquire. What a strange trippy touching movie ""The Future"" is. A muted and funny dramedy it was written and directed by Miranda July the performance artist and author whos added ""powerfully unique filmmaker"" to her resume. In 2005 she debuted with the charming ""Me and You and Everyone We Know."" In an effort to take on a little more responsibility Jason and Sophie adopt a cat. But Paw Paw is not just any kitty but one whose life expectancy isnt guaranteed. He is in renal failure. When Sophie (July) and Jason (Hamish Linklater) arrive crate in hand at the vet the 30-somethings learn two things that send them on a journey to live life differently more fully. Shes unhappy working at a dance studio. Hes thwarted working at home providing tech-service aid. In a flip of the flippancy of the saying ""50 is the new 40"" Jason refers to his and Sophies age nearing 40 ""you might as well be 50."" First although the cat is scratch scratch scratching on heavens door theres a chance it will bond with them and rally. For years the vet says reassuringly -- or threateningly depending on your perspective. Second contrary to what they were led to believe they cant take Paw Paw home until 30 days have passed. What follows are the divergent paths taken by the couple in those 30 days. Theres another reason Paw Paw is unusual He provides the movie with a very ruminative commentary. ""The Future"" is smart about the ways time and decisions made or evaded start to bear down once a person is settled into his or her 30s. Theyre less certain that the goals they imagined will be the goals they achieve. So Sophie and Jason hunker down into their hopes before Paw Paw arrives demanding all the caretaking the two can muster. Or so they fear. Sophie will make a YouTube dance video. A co-worker did one that has hits galore. Jason will let his spirit and coincidences lead him to his bliss. They lead him to an old man named Joe. Because this story concerns the elasticity of space and time who Joe might be to Jason is tricky. Joe Putterlik plays the geezer who sells refurbished stuff in the classifieds and shares with Jason some rather frank ideas about what makes for a long happy marriage. A nonactor but real-life PennySaver merchant Putterlik also provides the voice of the moon. We did say ""trippy"" right? Lanky curly-haired Linklater is as impressively deadpan (and warm) here as he was portraying Julia Louis-Dreyfus brother on ""The New Adventures of Old Christine."" In a brave gesture July cast herself in a role likely to aggravate. In wanting so much to achieve her artistic ambitions Sophie abandons them for a spell. She falls into a carnal relationship with a fairly conventional single dad (David Warshofsky) in Tarzana Calif. The most winning character? Well that would be Paw Paw. Confined to a cage he speaks his needs yearnings and fears with the voice of a child -- and the insights of an eternal elder.

Updated July 30 2016  753 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movies Close Roadside Attractions Miranda July and Hamish Linklater in ""The Future"" (Roadside Attractions) The Future The Future is curiously told through cats eyes BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Aug 19 2011 (...) Roadside Attractions Miranda July and Hamish Linklater in ""The Future"" (Roadside Attractions) Among the first things to ask about a movie are whos telling the story and is it meant to be believed. Are we seeing the perspective of an omniscient director a delusional character or a multitude of conflicting witnesses?""The Future"" is narrated by a scared cat that is recovering from a foot amputation and waiting for a mousey couple to adopt it. But the voice of the cat belongs to Miranda July the writer director and star of this elusive movie. In 2005 July directed an equally odd but considerably more poignant film called ""Me and You and Everyone We Know""; but she is primarily a performance artist. The principles of that theatrical art form are vaguely defined and understood and as her film flits in and out of the fantasy realm July doesnt cue us how she feels about the characters.Those characters are Sophie (July) and Jason (Hamish Linklater) a pair of passive-aggressive Los Angeles bohemians whose similar looks and lack of direction may or may not be Julys idea of social satire. When they work up the courage to adopt the ailing cat the couple are forced to wait a month while it heals. During that month Sophie and Jason drift apart as awkwardly as they must have drifted together. Jason decides hell be attuned to cosmic vibrations so he quits his job in tech support and becomes the worlds worst door-to-door salesman. Sophie stops doing her dance-a-day YouTube series after one try and impulsively calls a sleazy single dad (David Warshofsky) for the spontaneous sexual connection her life is lacking.A shared longing for connection and purpose roots the movie in recognizable emotions but the fleeting whimsy generates some oppressively hot air.

Miranda July as Sophie and Hamish Linklater as Jason in THE FUTURE written and directed by Miranda July. Photo Courtesy Of Roadside Attractions The Future review Cat complicates life 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Future Comedy-drama. Starring Miranda July Hamish Linklater and David Warshofsky. Directed by Miranda July. (R. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Future"" the latest from actress-filmmaker Miranda July tells the story of a husband and wife in their 30s whose relationship comes under stress when they make the decision to adopt a cat. With the adoption just a month away and facing the prospect of having to stay close to home for the duration of the cats life they re-examine their course and start going on divergent paths. The movie is original in its melancholic and disconnected aura. It evokes a sense of unacknowledged unspoken suffering the emptiness that can sometimes underlie surface contentment. As a writer and as a performer July has a pained deadpan humor thats distinct. Seemingly in passing July also exemplifies through her characters a new socioeconomic category the lost overeducated lower middle class on its way to becoming poor. Together these elements are major virtues and form a strong counterbalance to the films weaknesses - its irritating slowness its preciousness and its rigorous commitment to style a rigorousness that feels premature given that this is only the filmmakers second feature. No question July is an original and cant help but know it. But it would be a mistake for this talented artist to get lost in a certain way of doing things before she fully knows what she wants to do or is capable of doing. After all style is not a way of saying something but rather a consequence of having particular things to say. At times - not all the time just enough to notice - July gets it backward. Related Stories In The Future a cat complicates things Hamish Linklater who plays the husband looks a lot like July who plays the wife and seeing them together - playing characters so sensitive so intelligent and yet so weak and aimless - is a statement in itself. July also narrates the film in voiceover as the cat and every time she does its a white-knuckle thing. You have to hold on until she stops. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Miranda Julys second feature is beguiling quietly funny and finally very sad in a way that sneaks up on you before becoming clear as the Los Angeles skies beneath which its set.How can a movie with speaking parts for the moon and a cat be sad? Gracefully thats how. Rock and feline speak for a couple sent into freefall by the prospect of entering the adult world and staying there. Theres whimsy aplenty in the story of Sophie (writer-director July) and Jason (Hamish Linklater) a vaguely dissatisfied girlfriend and boyfriend who feel nothing particularly wrong with the way things are. Drifting through their 30s theyve chosen paths of least resistance -- hes a technical-support troubleshooter tethered to his telephone headset she teaches dance to toddlers -- and they sit in their modest apartment making small talk as they while away the days.Then they decide to adopt an ill cat with a banged-up paw. The furry friend in need of help represents a giant leap in responsibility and brings the Real World into sudden emotional focus.The Future doesnt have the same intimate sprawl as Julys first feature Me and You and Everyone We Know. Its leaps of imagination demand a little more of the viewer and Sophie and Jason can grate with their mix of existential stupor and slacker paralysis.But I found the combination of their entrapment and Julys willingness to defy realism enormously moving. Like Me and You The Future simply feels like no other film out there. If July the character is haunted by trepidation July the artist shows no fear of pushing movie storytelling to strange new limits. All rules are off but theyre not abandoned for the sake of shock or an empty gesture. The Future has a knack for using unusual images and ideas -- including the moon the cat and a T-shirt with a mind of its own -- in the service of Julys central theme the necessity and hazards of interconnectedness.The Future wont be for everyone and for that it deserves plaudits. Now more than ever the movies need all the original voices they can find. July more than qualifies.The FutureA- Starring Miranda July Hamish Linklater David Warshofsky Joe Putterlik and Isabella Acres. Directed by Miranda July. R (some sexual content). 91 mins.

The Future Good Director Miranda July. Cast Miranda July Hamish Linklater David Warshofsky. Rating R for some sexual content. Note At Harkins Camelview. This weeks new movie releases Some people will find Miranda Julys film a poetic triumph a meditation on responsibility and disappointment. Others will find it hopelessly pretentious one of those movies only pointy-headed critics can abide. I found the film to be more of the former than the latter. Except when the cat talks. That the cats name is Paw Paw doesnt help matters. Nor does the squeak-like-a-mouse voice July herself uses when providing Paw Paws voice (we see only her paws). Its not what Paw Paw says mind you that is so grating. Its how she says it. The film begins in the dark which is where Paw Paw a wild cat who has been injured spends her nights. But now she is in a vets office on the mend about to be adopted by Jason (Hamish Linklater) and Sophie (July) a Los Angeles couple slumping through life comfortable on their couch. He provides tech support over the phone in their tiny apartment while she teaches children to dance. Their hearts arent in either occupation or much else though they clearly care for each other. But they wanted more. Adopting Paw Paw who also has renal failure will give them a sense of responsibility they figure a focus to their lives. But the vet cant release Paw Paw to them for a month so they decide to prepare and to become more grown-up. This involves quitting their jobs for some reason and getting rid of their Internet connection. Jason sells trees door-to-door for an environmental group while Sophie plans to post a dance a day on YouTube. (Shell use the coffee shops Wi-Fi connection.) Things do not go as planned. Jason develops an offbeat friendship with an old man (Joe Putterlik) while Sophie develops more with a single father (David Warshofsky excellent in a really odd sort of way). Meanwhile Paw Paw waits. Besides these developments we also see a T-shirt that seems to be alive we learn that the moon talks (at least to Jason) and crucially that Jason has the ability to stop time. Its played as a joke at first and granted it sounds rather silly. But the moment where Jason stops time for real - when he cannot bear to hear news that he isnt sure he can withstand - it is incredibly powerful. Who among us would not wish for such a gift just once to stop time at the moment just before our hearts are about to be broken? Even if it might not work exactly as planned (do such gifts ever?). For all the hipster elements July who wrote and directed as well fills her film with moments like these are what make ""The Future"" worth the effort. This is not necessarily an easy film to like but it is upon reflection one well worth appreciating. The magical elements do not distract. Instead they only reinforce the drama of everyday life. There are no easy answers offered because none is available. Growing up is a difficult painful experience especially if you put it off as long as Jason and Sophie have. Not everything about ""The Future"" works. But most of it does in a quietly powerful way. Except for Paw Paws voice. Some things you just cant get past.

By Peter Rainer Film critic August 5 2011 Save for later Saved Miranda July portrays Sophie (l.) and Hamish Linklater portrays Jason in a scene from The Future. Roadside Attractions/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Miranda July is for some a triple threat writer-director-actress of uncommonly poetic gifts and even rarer a sense of humor. Shes written some graceful fiction and debuted as a filmmaker with ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" a performance art-style piece about loneliness that has its moments - although not as many as its enthusiasts claim.""The Future"" Julys coy and precious new film is just oddball enough to be interesting if not good. It stars July as Sophie a discombobulated childrens dance instructor who with her boyfriend Jason (Hamish Linklater) is planning to bring home from a shelter an ailing cat named Paw Paw once it recovers in a month. They prepare for the event like expectant parents. (Paw Paw by the way narrates - a Disneyfied art-house touch.)There are some amusing scenes of Sophies dance videos (shes not much of a dancer) and Jason going door to door for anti-global warming solicitations. There are also a few arresting ideas - like the way Jason freezes time when hes distraught over Sophies infidelity and needs to think things over. But even here the trickery can be pretty tenuous. July like Hal Hartley another overrated art-house luminary is an acquired taste I have yet to acquire. Grade B- (Rated R for some sexual content.)

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The surreal dramedy ""The Future"" gives us a pair of characters who face it nervously. Sophie (writer/director Miranda July) is a childrens dance teacher too self-conscious to shed her inhibitions and cut loose. When she vows to create 30 YouTube dance clips in 30 days shes petrified with performance anxiety. Her boyfriend Jason (Hamish Linklater) a computer-support techie seems more plugged in to the unseen clients who call the couples apartment with glitches. The mid-30ish couple are together in name only intertwining their legs when they share the sofa but focused on their individual laptops. To test their flagging romance they decide to adopt an ailing shelter cat. Their visit to the shelter unexpectedly changes the characters horizons. Instead of a renewed commitment they find uncertainty after uncertainty. If you are familiar with Julys imaginative world from her acclaimed short stories or her captivating 2005 Cannes triumph ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" it will not surprise you that the cat Paw-Paw narrates parts of the story. July provides the felines scratchy-squeaky voice which is fitting. Paw-Paws sighing monologues of yearning and disappointment in the shelter mirror Sophies mental state of chipper despair. The actors are quite engaging in their mopey way. July brings a tentative neediness to her character; you can almost see an ""Adopt Me"" sign around her neck. Linklater so physically similar to his lanky mop-haired co-star that they could be siblings expresses his longing and doubt about their romance through tiny meticulously observed physical giveaways. When Jason gives Sophie the side eye you know theyre in trouble without a word being exchanged. There are laughs in this story of disconnected people. July doesnt deal in knee-slappers but droll off-kilter moments of absurd insight. Her vignettes are living ""New Yorker"" cartoons. Sophie imagines her life slipping away during a sign-up session at the childrens dance studio her clients evolving through an entire life cycle while she remains stuck at the reception desk. Like Paw-Paw shes waiting for someone to rescue her. Jason distraught at the idea of a breakup discovers he has the power to freeze time and desperately puts their separation on hold. Then he wanders through a nighttime Los Angeles made beautiful by suspended animation. With a thousand odd details July builds a story with a surprising emotional wallop. By the finale the fate of that shelter cat will have you by the throat. THE FUTURE  out of 4 stars RATING R for some sexual content RottenTomatoes.com read reviews Showtimes view listings What does it all mean? Your guess is as good as mine. July expects each of us to puzzle out the significance on our own. Julys falling out of love story is a perplexing haunting concoction of whimsy sadness and beauty.

He is a member of the National Society of Film Critics author of the books Hollywood Cafe Coffee With the Stars and Hollywood Rides a Bike Cycling With the Stars and producer at ridesabike.com. More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 If Miranda July had worked in the past as opposed to starring in The Future - if say she was alive and kicking in 1930s and 40s Hollywood - she mightve been another Claudette Colbert playing the daffy dame the screwball muse. More about The Future >> There is something about Julys slight build and cartoon eyes her frailty hiding ferocity that would have been just right in romantic romps with Clark Gable James Stewart Gary Cooper. What she would have done with her performance art stuff well what did the world do before performance art? Vaudeville does that count? Anyway here she is in the very modern and mysterious The Future - a film she wrote (adapting her own performance piece) and directed and which she stars in opposite the decidedly un-Gable-esque Hamish Linklater. Shes Sophie hes Jason and the two of them are in a state of profound inertia. Uneasy silences drift through the couples tiny L.A. flat and its all they can do to pry themselves off the couch or the bed or the laptop to do something like shop or cook or go for a walk. On one level The Future is about a man and a woman as unit - the entity (and entropy) of domestic partnership. This is Sophie and Jason the way none of their friends see them (although they dont seem to have many) alone together swaddled in ennui. But then comes Paw Paw or more accurately the idea of Paw Paw. Shes a stray cat that they hope to adopt as soon as shes recovered from whatever ailment it is thats keeping her in the animal hospital. To accommodate this new creature to be responsible for this other being in their lives (feline as stand-in for fetus) Sophie and Jason take drastic measures They quit their jobs they abandon the Internet. He volunteers for some green sustainable plant-a-tree organization. She meets an old man (Joe Putterlik) who proudly shares the dirty poems and cards he wrote for his late wife. And then she meets another man Marshall (David Warshofsky) a middle-aged suburbanite who couldnt be more different and less cool than Sophie. Of course she and this stranger fall into an animated sexual affair; Sophie practically moves into the house he shares with his daughter (Isabella Acres) a girl who buries herself in the garden. (Literally buries herself - the tableau is very David Lynch.) Sophie is hiding out in this other mans home this other mans world. Paw Paw is waiting in hers. And Jason is stuck in time. The Future is odder and darker than Julys first feature the 2005 Sundance discovery Me and You and Everyone We Know. But it is similar in the way it portrays people who are isolated from one another spinning in their own orbits caroming around the universe. And July likes her rhythms to shuffle her beats to go long. She is the master of sideways portent - the small act with big ramifications. A meditation on mortality on loneliness on the way technology and narcissism have intersected to create a fascinating monster (theres a running joke about YouTube dance videos) The Future is all of this and more. What Frank Capra would have made of it who knows? But he would have liked its star. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 05 2011 1201AM EDT Last updated Tuesday Jul. 02 2013 454PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Before we get to The Future a word about the past. Historically on any tour of the indie film circuit you cant walk a step without tripping over a relationship flick the kind where navel-gazing couples prattle on endlessly about love found and lost. And yes broadly speaking this is another relationship flick. But in the dexterous hands of Miranda July - who when not making movies is writing short stories or staging performance art or generally consolidating her title as the reigning Queen of Quirk - both the relationship and the flick are unlike any youve seen before. Admittedly like all brands of quirky hers is an acquired taste. It can definitely grate on your nerves but at best it also gets into your mind and sticks fast. Multimedia The Future the official trailer Back in her feature debut Me and You and Everyone We Know July focused on discovering love. Here she shifts to the much harder task of maintaining it. After several years together Jason (Hamish Linklater) and Sophie (July) share many things a low-rent apartment in L.A. the no-longer-tender age of 35 a mass of curly hair atop anxiously thin frames jobs they dont much like and the certainty that the future is closing in on them fast. Or as he puts it ""After 50 its just loose change.""To embrace responsibility the two decide to adopt from the pound an injured cat named Paw Paw which they can pick up in a month when its wounds have healed. In the first of the quirks to come July makes her own decision to have the animal narrate the movie - in a small scratchy voice opining on big nagging topics like existential ""darkness."" Well its a cute gimmick. As feline philosophers go Paw Paw is the cats meow.Anyway in the intervening month before pet parenthood Sophie and Jason pledge to explore whats left of their freedom. They opt to quit those onerous jobs disconnect from the Internet and pursue their creative side. He puts his trust in the whims of fate venturing outside for some close encounters with interesting (and of course quirky) strangers. Less bravely she takes a more goal-oriented approach shutting herself in the apartment to choreograph ""30 dances in 30 days."" Stalled on Day 1 Sophie panics and flees from her unproductive self into an affair with a middle-aged guy living a middle-class life in the suburban confines of the Valley. Learning of her betrayal a crushed Jason yearns to turn back the clock and stop time whereupon the film takes a surreal turn - he bargains with the moon with loves symbol while she is literally pursued by his old sweater by the tattered remnants of loves past.From there the questions press Will Sophie come back? Will Jason let go? More to the point do we care either way? No and yes. At times Julys mannered style only serves to distance us from her characters who seem little more than frail vessels in a sea of familiar themes - security vs. risk boredom vs. adventure self-negation vs. self-discovery. However at other moments those same mannerisms generate real emotional tension and give to the old themes a fresh life. Thats when the surreal imagery starts getting into our head; thats when the dialogue loses its preciousness to speak with arresting eloquence.For example consider this remark from Sophie who standing before a mirror assesses her appearance ""I wish I were just one notch prettier. Im right on the edge where each person must decide for themselves. I have to make my case with each person."" Casual yet clever the line resonates precisely because we all live on that same edge a notch shy of something - if not prettiness then smarts or talent or strength of character or fullness of heart - striving yet again to make our case with the next person and by extension ourselves. So The Future ends where the past began and the present continues precisely on the edge with love teetering in the balance - a human constant in constant jeopardy.The FutureDirected and written by Miranda JulyStarring Miranda July and Hamish LinklaterClassification 14A Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments Print /License AA In the know Life This woman became a middle-age man magnet.

For fans of Miranda Julys singular surreal debut ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" the future has long held enormous promise At some point we knew this sui generis storyteller would return and grace us with another dose of her delightfully peculiar worldview. Now that ""The Future"" has become the present July doesnt disappoint examining a Los Angeles couple whose decision to adopt a cat motivates them to overhaul their lives completely. Prominent exposure at the Sundance and Berlin fests all but assures a respectable specialty release. Shifting attention from the difficulties of finding a connection (a la ""Me and You"") to the vagaries of trying to maintain an adult relationship writer-director July builds ""The Future"" around ideas of insecurity and uncertainty casting herself as Sophie a childrens dance instructor who isnt much of a dancer herself. Sophie and Jason (Hamish Linklater endearingly awkward) have been dating for five years and are ready to take the next step agreeing to bring a cat into their home -- not just any cat either but a wounded stray named Paw Paw with a life expectancy of somewhere between six months and five years. Paw Paw narrates a whimsical choice made possible through a series of melancholy monologues pantomimed by two oversized front paws (one of them in a plaster cast) at the nearby animal hospital. Sophie and Jason must wait 30 days for Paw Paws leg to heal a timeframe that inspires them to behave like cancer patients whove just learned they have one month to live. They both quit their jobs; Jason starts hunting for cosmic signs in the PennySaver while Sophie spontaneously starts an affair with a man (David Warshofsky) who makes promotional signs for a living. While these developments do not bode well for the couples future pet-rearing skills they do support a series of amusing episodes including an encounter with a sage old man (Joe Putterlik) whose home furnishings uncannily match the couples own choice of decor -- a sneak peek of whats in store for them perhaps? Of course not all auds see the charm in a grown woman who clings to an oversized T-shirt like its some kind of safety blanket (which yields perhaps the most outlandish payoff). July risks alienating a certain contingent with every twee idea she throws at the screen but shes fearless in her execution earning hearty laughs throughout as she unveils inventive new ways of tackling the absurdities of life. In one such scene after failing to launch her own YouTube-based dance project Sophie accepts a job as receptionist at her old studio where instead of imagining herself getting older she pictures friends kids growing up right before her eyes. When Sophie decides to tell Jason of her infidelity he responds by freezing time and begging the moon for advice. Though we hope things will turn out right ""The Future"" makes no assurances that the couple will stay together or even that the cat will want them when they return. For all the superficial hilarity of Julys approach a much sadder streak runs deep through the entire film reinforced by Jon Brions score (more tones than melody). Still its curious that this is the feeling she chooses to leave us with in the end. Instead of building to some grand finale designed to encompass all that has come before ""The Future"" remains forward-facing loose ends and all. There can be no question that the Sophie and Jason seen at the close of the film are completely different from the more childlike versions presented at the outset.

TWITTER Overly precious poetic examination of a coupleas eccentric attempts to evolve their lives will appeal to a rarified few. PARK CITY -- (Premieres) A film as fragile and miniaturist as its title is grandiose The Future is just too terribly twee to readily embrace. Miranda Julys long-awaited second feature brandishes poetic insights and imaginative flights akin to those that graced her 2005 debut Me and You and Everyone We Know  but without nearly so much of the bracing outrageousness and sense of surprise. This quiet quirky look at a couple haplessly trying to envision and manipulate their future will no doubt gather some ardent fans around it but their numbers will be small. After its Sundance debut the German-American coproduction will play in competition at the Berlin Film Festival next month. Active in assorted media July has a rarified sensibility thats hard to pin down as its both rigorous and massively whimsical. Here unfortunately the latter dominates in a portrait of two 35-year-olds whose intensely limited and selective way of examining their position in life and the world suggests delusional naivete and a decidedly self-deceptive way of preparing for the eventuality indicated by the title. As before the charm of the filmmakers idiosyncratic conceits is disarming at first.  Philosophically matter-of-fact narration is provided in a scratchy high voice by an ailing cat that Jason (Hamish Linklater) and Sophie (July) have committed to taking home from a shelter upon its projected recovery in a month.  The cat as it turns out has a more coherent view of life the passage of time and the hereafter than do the humans who live in a nondescript section of Los Angeles and in a manner no more productive or pulled together than is common among unmotivated undergrads. Both slim gangly and unruly-haired Jason and Sophie speak about adopting the cat (""I think were ready"") as others would discuss having a baby and oddly link their prospects for moving on in life to this momentous step. As part of the process they agree to junk their addictions to technology in preparation for it and devote their time to other tentatively quixotic pursuits Sophie to making decidedly amateurish dance videos (so much for their technology ban) and Jason to doing door-to-door solicitation for anti-global warming tree buying. If this isnt enough to send some rugged viewers looking for the exit what follows becomes needlessly perplexing as what little storytelling there is both halts and fractures while the films philosophical concerns are obliquely expressed to exceedingly modest effect. There will be those to whom Julys elusive manner and message speak directly but to most they will come off as needlessly affected and irrelevant to anything connected to real life. Anyone who was put off by the smug self-absorption of the couple in Sam Mendes Away We Go might be similarly afflicted by the duo here. The two leads performances stress a perplexity with life above all else and there is almost no sense of a physical relationship between the two despite the amount of time they spend in bed or in close proximity within their inelegant apartment. As in her first film the director continues to display a knack for clean confident visuals and a fine fluency in editing and the use of music.

Starring Miranda July Hamish Linklater Director Miranda July Running time 131 Release Opened Aug 5 2011  Editorial Review Growing up ready or notBy Ann HornadayFriday Aug 05 2011With wit and unsettling strangeness ""The Future"" takes a sitcom premise - two skittish 35-year-olds adopting a sick and injured cat in order to tiptoe into the responsibilities of adulthood - and gives it a radical otherworldly twist. That should come as no surprise to fans of writer-director Miranda July whose 2005 serio-comedy ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" announced her as an off-kilter visionary talent. ""The Future"" in which July co-stars with Hamish Linklater proves that shes no mere one-hit wonder although her strange hybrid of screwball humor and solemnity transgressive sex and winsomeness will never be fodder for garden-variety cineplex-dwellers. Viewers need to be prepared to enter into Julys world which is as likely to feature a talking cat or a walking T-shirt as the more banal realities of young-middle-aged life in Los Angeles. Thats where Jason (Linklater) and Sophie (July) have been marking time for the past few years he working in computer tech support she teaching at a kids dance school ""gearing up to do something really incredible"" one of these days. When they find an injured cat and take him to the vet they discover that the animal has only months to live. They name him Paw-Paw and agree to love him unconditionally until he dies. Then another vet informs them he could linger for years throwing the commitment-averse couple into an immediate emotional crisis. If Paw-Paw lives for five years Sophie notes that theyll be 40 when he dies. ""Forty is basically 50"" Jason says quietly panicking. ""And then after 50 the rest is just loose change."" Such is the subtle off-handed humor that infuses ""The Future"" where irony and earnestness vie mightily for psychic pride of place as Jason and Sophie plunge into separate but equally alien worlds to stave off their encroaching anxieties. Its possible to see ""The Future"" as part of a diptych with ""Beginners"" which also came out this summer and was made by Julys real-life husband Mike Mills. Both films possess carefully curated visual styles protagonists who are terrified of embarking and enough confidence to include a talking animal without winking. But ""The Future"" is the scarier darker film by far with July exploring Sophies most predatory feline instincts with unblinking and even brave frankness. ""The Future"" also taps into a remarkable cinematic theme this year having to do with parallel universes and alternate realities - most explored recently in ""Another Earth"" and featured in Lars von Triers upcoming ""Melancholia."" Julys background as a performance artist clearly informs her portrayal of Sophie from her impromptu dancerly stretches to an amusing riff on feeling stymied while friends mature and have families of their own. But with ""The Future"" she makes good on the promise of ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" proving that shes a bona fide filmmaker of real ambition and scope. What does ""The Future"" hold?

"The Future movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Future offers whimsy in the right measureThe Future a 3 starsAugust 05 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticHamish Linklater and Miranda July in ""The Future.""""Now that this has happened what are my options?"" Sophie asks her new thrill Marshall in ""The Future."" Sophies long-term boyfriend Jason does not yet know about the affair.""Well"" Marshall says. ""Traditionally people either tell the truth or they lie.""Sophies response ""I could never do either of those things.""Thats a funny line -- Neil Simon funny ba-DUM-bum funny. Yet the writer-director of ""The Future"" Miranda July is also the female lead and there is not a performer on this earth less inclined to go for the ba-DUM-bum or the rat-a-tat-tat. Which makes Sophies reply both funny and honest.A uniquely vexing blend of foggy whimsy and observant soul-searching ""The Future"" follows Julys debut feature ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" (2005) in which July also appeared though in a secondary role. Here she co-stars with Hamish Linklater who looks and talks a lot like July does moppy dark hair soft squishy conversational rhythms. Besides Sophie Jason (Linklater) and Marshall (David Warshofsky) the other major presence in ""The Future"" is a street cat Paw-Paw recently rescued and now scheduled for adoption whose thoughts about life mortality and yearning we hear in voice-over. July herself provides the cat voice.Living in LA preschool dance and movement instructor Sophie and tech-support home worker Jason see their commitment to Paw-Paws adoption as a deadline. They have 30 days before the cats in good enough shape to bring home. This means they have 30 days to go wild in their own uncertain fashion. Now well into their 30s Jason and Sophie hear the clock ticking. ""Forty"" says Jason ""is basically 50 and after 50 the rest is just loose change ... not quite enough to get anything you really want.""Jason volunteers for a Greenpeace-type project raising money door to door to fight global warming. Sophie decides to post 30 YouTube dance performances in 30 days. Then more or less by accident she has an affair. Which changes everything though shes not sure how or in what ways. ""The Future"" nudges its characters in metaphysical directions notably when Jason -- who early on jokes that he has the ability to stop time -- turns out to have the ability for real as well as to converse with the moon or the unseen man in it.Some of Julys notions feel cloying at worse easy at best When the parallels between Paw-Paw and Sophie are laid out for example we hear theres a ""wild"" nature in both creatures that cannot be denied. This sense of unruly behavior is mitigated deliberately by the gentleness and odd comic grace of Julys presence and voice. The movie doesnt have much of a motor. But I like a lot of it line to line and I admire where were left at the end. No clear answers no facile resolution. Just an open question relationally speaking.mjphillipstribune.comThe Future -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for some sexual content)Cast Hamish Linklater (Jason); Miranda July (Sophie); David Warshofsky (Marshall); Isabella Acres (Gabriella); Joe Putterlik (Joe The Moon)Credits Written and directed by Miranda July; produced by Gina Kwon Roman Paul and Gerhard Meixner.

The movie ends in a deep and extraordinary demonstration of how the world spins forward whether were ready or not. In between this daring singular project blithely risks accusations of cutesiness The movie is framed by narration from Paw Paw the cat in question (voiced by the movies writer-director-star Miranda July) with only those witty-bitty paw-paws visible. The Future belongs to Sophie (July) who teaches dance to little kids while dreaming of sharing her own choreography with a YouTube audience and to her boyfriend Jason (The New Adventures of Old Christines marvelous Hamish Linklater) who would like to grow up to be maybe oh a world leader but meanwhile provides tech support from his home phone. As she did in her striking 2005 debut Me and You and Everyone We Know July creates a fluid cinematic universe flexible enough to embrace the artists favorite interests; she weaves in performance art (Sophies dances are...different) and Internet culture (the couple are glued to their laptops). And she creates perfect images of supernatural everydayness. A little girl literally digs herself into a hole. The moon speaks. In The Future everything is possible. A?

"The Future movie review Directors singular vision makes for a flawed but fascinating film |       NJ.com comments The Future movie review Directors singular vision makes for a flawed but fascinating film Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 29 2011 at 736 AM updated July 30 2011 at 1256 PM View/Post Comments Roadside AttractionsMiranda July and Hamish Linklater in ""The Future"" which July wrote and directed. Unique is an overused word. But in the case of Miranda July it may be the only one that applies. Shes a performance artist short-story writer actress and filmmaker. And her new film ""The Future"" features a fellow who can stop time a philosophical man in the moon sudden shifts into the future and a strangely animated T-shirt that follows its owner around like a guilty conscience. Oh and its narrated by a cat sitting in an animal shelter sadly counting down the days to euthanasia. As I said -- unique. That isnt of and by itself a recommendation; there are parts of this movie (particularly the baby-voiced narration from the cat) that are awfully ickily cute. But the whole film is so determinedly different it makes the sticky-sweet bits a little easier to bear. The plot such as it is has July and lanky lookalike Hamish Linklater -- with their mops of curly hair they look like two chrysanthemums in a strong wind -- hitting a bump in their relationship as they add a new responsibility and begin to feel their age. Movie Review The Future (R) Roadside Attractions (91 min.) Directed by Miranda July. With July Hamish Linklater. Now playing in New York. Rating note The film contains sexual situations brief nudity and strong language. Stephen Whittys Review TWO AND A HALF STARS Of course that responsibility is only a pet not a baby. And their age at 35 or so is hardly daunting. But its enough to nearly knock down these two barely budded flowers. And so they both quit their barely there jobs. He retreats into door-to-door do-gooder activism. She attempts a dance project and immediately frustrated decides to try an affair instead. Clearly its easier to sympathize with his crisis than hers. And at times its hard to take either of them too seriously; theyre in their mid-30s and they seem as if theyre in their mid-teens. But July has a sharp observant eye and lovely loony deadpan style with words (her last better film ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" captured it even more clearly). She also has a wonderful feel for the eccentrics and eccentricities of daily life and is happy to make metaphors real. Linklaters character for example is afraid of where this relationship is going so the script gives him the ability to freeze time stopping it briefly in its tracks. Julys heroine is wounded but wild and unsure she wants to settle down -- just like that highly talkative cat shes trying to adopt. ""The Future"" isnt for everyone; there were times off and on when it really wasnt for me. But then there were little surreal moments -- like the little girl whos so withdrawn she digs a hole in the backyard to sleep in or the settled friends who age decades before Julys eyes -- when it came to stubborn singular life. A little loopy? Sure. But also definitely unique.

(Handout) BY Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITIC Friday July 29 2011 400 AM THE GUARD -- 3 STARSBlackly comic thriller about an Irish detective working with an FBI agent (136). R Sexuality violence. At area theaters.To American audiences Brendan Gleeson is probably best known for his small role as ""Harry Potters"" Mad-Eye Moody. Thats a shame given his ability to take over the screen.So grab this opportunity to discover his outsize talents if you havent yet. In John Michael McDonaghs darkly comic crime thriller Gleeson plays Boyle an effective but ill-tempered cop whose fiefdom in County Galway is threatened by drug dealers. The uptight FBI agent (Don Cheadle a sturdy straight man) sent over to help is in Boyles opinion nothing more than another hurdle to be conquered.McDonagh indulges in too many 90s affectations from blaring chapter titles to philosophizing gangsters. But he captures his misty settings insular atmosphere beautifully.And hes wise enough to rely on the fearsome funny instincts of his star.THE FUTURE -- 2 STARSAn unmotivated couple is shaken into action (131). R Sexuality. At the IFC.Miranda Julys rejection of traditional storytelling is valuable but the common complaints that her work is mannered or twee are accurate.And in her second film about a quirky couple (July and Hamish Linklater) terrified by the prospect of middle age those distinctive traits dont take her very far.A cat confesses its inner feelings the moon wisely advises and humans speak in defiantly stilted cadence. Sometimes these characters say things worth hearing. But too often and in contrast to her first feature ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" Julys calculated delivery doesnt reveal the profundity required to elevate it beyond a self-conscious deadpan.As a writer she has a compelling take on life choices but these are best represented onscreen by the less-showy Link-later. His actions are equally deliberate but more insightful and when he talks the method serves the movie.ATTACK THE BLOCK -- 4 STARSBritish thriller about kids chased by aliens (168). R Violence drugs language. At the Empire 25 Union Square.Remember when you watched Simon Pegg and Edgar Wrights inventive zombie comedy ""Shaun of the Dead"" and thought ""Wow I cant wait to see what these guys do next""? Well expect to feel the same about this monster movie from Joe Cornish.Though less ambitious Cornishs big-screen debut shares a similar sensibility mixing dry British humor and social satire with electric thrills. When some trouble-making kids find an alien outside their grim London housing project they set off a life-or-death race between species. Their only help is a nurse theyve just mugged (Jodie Whittaker) and a genial stoner (Nick Frost) so its really up to their young leader (John Boyega) to save the day.The cast is splendid the script quick-witted and the action satisfying. If Steven Spielberg and J.J. Abrams had turned ""Super 8"" into a low-budget B-movie it might have looked something like this.

Sophie (July) and Jason (Hamish Linklater) tousled-hair 30-somethings resembling emo Muppets plan to adopt a wounded cat from a shelter then worry ""parenthood"" will make them boring has-beens. Told they have to wait a month to pick up Paw Paw the couple resolve to realize all their dreams before then. They aim low. Sophie a dance teacher wants to choreograph a viral video hit while Jason quits his IT job to become one of those clipboard-wielders who ask if you have a moment to stop global warming. Meanwhile their sage cat-in-waiting (voiced by July) muses on love life and the hereafter. Delving into magical realism writer-director July (""Me and You and Everyone We Know"") enlightens and irritates in equal measure. Sophie struggles believably with a creative dry spell shaking off her existential stupor with an affair in the suburbs. Jason freaks out and in a neat mid-argument trick hits the pause button on life. To Julys credit this still feels like youre glimpsing the inner workings of a real relationship. But the omnipresence of oddity in ""The Future"" dilutes its charm A T-shirt creeps around on its own a little girl likes being buried neck-deep in the backyard. Whatevs. Still its not every day you see a sex scene where the heroine gets busy with a couch.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Miranda Julys second feature The Future the quirky performance artist casts herself as a dance teacher who has difficulty dancing when shes by herself because whenever she starts to move her head she gets distracted by the fine details of the room around her and whenever she starts to move her body so many possibilities open up that she freezes. Thats also a fair description of Julys filmmaking which is preoccupied with the minuscule almost to the point of being trifling. Julys debut feature Me And You And Everyone We Know for example contrasted people in real pain with emotionally stunted ninnies and seemed to hold both in distressingly equal regard. On the surface The Future seems eminently mockable. July stars opposite Hamish Linklater (from the underrated sitcom The New Adventures Of Old Christine and not incidentally a July look-alike) who plays her equally immobile boyfriend. When the couple agrees to adopt a sickly cat with a wounded paw--a cat that narrates its own scenes--they worry that even this small amount of responsibility will impede their ability to do all the awesome things they currently arent doing. So they decide to make the most of the remaining month while the kitty is convalescing at the shelter. They quit their jobs disconnect the Internet and pledge to remain open to whatever the universe throws at them. The Futures main characters are undeniably dopes. But July and Linklater turn their ineptitude into a funny running joke which becomes surprisingly affecting in the second half as July decides to jump-start her life by having an affair with a wealthy suburbanite while Linklater decides to freeze time. (It makes sense in context.) The Future is full of amusing lovely little moments that are just a degree removed from being too cute whether July is being stalked by her favorite comfy shirt or following a little girls plan to sleep in a hole to its logical endpoint. The Future is elliptical but never shaggy. July is focused throughout mediating on movement--the seduction and fear of it--while encouraging the audience to care about a pair of do-nothings who like to preserve the broken. Theres even a creeping level of tension in the movie as July and Linklater decide what to do when its their relationship thats busted. Do they toss it out? Or just tape up the frayed wires and get a few more not entirely satisfying years out of it? In Julys constrained world the resolution to that question qualifies as a nail-biter.

Hoberman In The Future Miranda July Grows Up Wednesday July 27 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 The kids grow up Adults July and LinklaterRoadside Attractions A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Is there such thing as a sincerely calculated naivete? Or put another way does Miranda July have any idea of how annoying she is?On the basis of The Future writer/filmmaker/performance artist Julys second feature Id guess that she must. A fabricator of her own screen image July--the high priestess of quirk--has a lineage that can be traced back to art-world pop star Laurie Anderson to muscular mind-tripper Yvonne Rainer to the original psychodramatist Maya Deren. Even more than Anderson July is an unabashed cutie-pie seemingly determined to play the eternal permanently precocious ingenue. At the same time The Future hints at a degree of ironic self-awareness on the part of the 37-year-old artist unimaginable in Deren Rainer and even Anderson.One minute into The Future an arch scratchy little voice attributed to Paw Paw the cat but unmistakably belonging to the filmmaker poses the question ""Have you ever been outside?"" Seldom have I felt so directly addressed. The urge to bolt the screening room was overwhelming. Julys first feature the irritating yet hard-to-hate 2005 Camera dOr winner Me and You and Everyone We Know began in similar fashion and among other things concerned a goofy earnest video artist (July) in romantic pursuit of a divorced shoe salesman. The Future revisits a similar situation from a somewhat different perspective.Jason (Hamish Linklater known to Shakespeare in the Park patrons for some memorable clowning) and Sophie (July) a somewhat depressed marginally droll eminently swattable couple of early thirtysomethings tiff and riff around their Los Angeles apartment feasting on minor misunderstandings and imagining their dotage. A wide-eyed space child with a pale Pre-Raphaelite quality Sophie teaches modern dance to three-year-olds. This wistful tentative somewhat wilted flower is not without her mystery Is she an intentionally comic character? Is her morning salutation (""Hi person"") meant to be charming? Jason who does computer-tech support from home has a birds-nest hairdo and an even more frightened look on his face. More than symbiotic theyre virtual twins who have resolved to change their life together by adopting a cat--in fact a problem cat with a questionable future.Paw Paw will require total care. The expectant couple will have to wait a month for her and if they change their mind the kitty will be put down. In preparation for Paw Paw Sophie and Jason quit their jobs. She resolves to create a new dance to post on YouTube every day; he resolves to help save the planet going door to door soliciting money for the Greenpeace-like Tree by Tree. (They also decide to terminate their Internet connection which triggers a flurry of last-minute Googling and complicates Sophies project.) Meanwhile we are privy to grateful Paw Paws consciousness--shes patiently waiting and even counting the days.The Future is transparently a movie about having a child as well as about being one. Thwarted in her dance-a-day project Sophie awkwardly seduces a 50-ish single dad. Marshall (David Warshofsky) is even clumsier than Jason and no less dull but at least hes a ""man"" with a home in the Valley and a six-year-old daughter named Gabriella. Sophie seems to be enjoying her childlike affair--shes slightly more animated and somewhat better-looking when with Marshall. She is even able to establish a fragile connection with Gabriella who has busied herself digging a grave in the backyard. (Jason meanwhile quits his idealistic new job in despair and plaintive Paw Paw still dreaming of her new life imagines the letter she would write to her prospective owners--if she could write.)The movies final act is complicated by a metaphoric toy chest of New Age tropes (a Sophie doppelganger in the form of an enchanted T-shirt; an elderly advice-giving man in the moon) as well as sundry parallel worlds alternate lives and second personalities. July is something of a magician and somewhere amid the inability to stop time the finality of unborn children the failure to protect posterity the end of romantic love the limitations of memory the routine of carelessness and the futility of expectations Sophies (or is it Julys?) coy narcissism becomes a criticism of itself and her ""sadness"" turns into something truly sad. In short I have seen The Future and its heartbreaking.jhobermanvillagevoice.com Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

Like that playful study of human behavior the new work deals with people feeling isolated by the world around them. Simultaneously funny and sad in its evocation of an L.A.-based thirty-something couple worried about the next stages of their lives ""The Future"" hits a uniquely somber note thats more impressive on the level of mood than narrative. Beginning with credits placed over ""stopped time"" July delves into the personal dramas afflicting Sophie (July) and Jason (Hamish Linklater an established stage actor making his breakthrough screen performance) whose relationship dynamic grows troubled with the arrival of an adopted cat. The unlikely narrator of the story the poetic feline ""Paw Paw"" establishes the movies soul-searching vibe in the first seconds of the movie romantically pontificating about his dream of going outdoors. (July assumes the cats POV and operates a pair of puppet paws instantly establishing the movies lighthearted spirit.) Forced to leave the ailing cat at the vet for a month before they can officially integrate him into their lives the couple decide to look at that looming date as a turning point that marks the beginning of their next stage together. Contemplating the future instantly puts them on edge. ""Forty is basically fifty"" Sophie asserts establishing an early midlife crisis that instantly offsets their joint stability. Suddenly confused about their prospects together they each seek out a new purpose. Jason quits his work-at-home gig as a customer service rep and randomly joins a volunteer service to save trees while Sophie decides to devote her life to dance. But their real transitions take place on personal levels disassociated from specific professional interests. On a whim Sophie calls the artist responsible for a drawing the couple buys at the veterinarians office creating a secret bond with the older suburban everyman Marshall (David Warshofsky). Their burgeoning affair marks another instance in the July oeuvre of strangers forming a connection to assuage their collective alienation as they did via the internet in ""Me and You."" In this case however Sophies infidelity is the most conventional twist in a movie devoted to original strategies for evoking universal anxieties. When Jason freezes the scene to avoid confronting Sophie about her other man he finds himself in an abstract limbo where his only companion is the moon an affable cosmic presence willing to provide sage advice. In her uneasy double-life with Jason Sophie fears her evasion of responsibility in the form of a t-shirt that literally chases her down and engulfs her body at which point she engages in a ritualistic dance that speaks volumes about her constant disorientation. Meanwhile Jason also forms an unconventional bond--with an elderly man who may or may not represent Jasons future self. Comically odd and symbolically profound ""The Future"" works wonders when July takes her intentions to their stylistic extremes. With a delectable Jon Brion soundtrack guiding the proceedings the movie adopts a familiar bittersweetness but otherwise takes on a highly original tone. As the portrait of a relationship meltdown involving two eccentric creative types prone to self-doubt Julys sophomore feature bears a strong resemblance to husband Mike Millss upcoming ""Beginners"" although Julys version of the story has a more experimental edge. It primarily succeeds by leaving its metaphoric content open-ended arguing that the only thing determinable about the future is that it exists entirely within the minds those willing to imagine it. HOW WILL IT PLAY? As they did with ""Me and You and Everyone We Know"" Julys idiosyncratic sensibilities are destined to divide people although mostly strong critical reactions and a hip appeal among artsy crowds may elevate its profile. The movies best hope lies with a smallish distributor that can tap into that niche audience and drive their support to a healthy life on VOD. criticWIRE grade B+ This Article is related to Festivals and tagged Reviews Sundance Film Festival The Future More From IndieWireBoJack Horseman Brilliantly Argues Why Comedy Belongs in the Abortion DebateReview Vice Principals Charms With A-Grade Class Clowns But This VP Is No VeepReview Stranger Things is Still Waiting for Something New To Make It Feel AliveThe Black List Expands This Years Cassian Elwes Screenwriting Fellowship for 2017 Comments TK May 12 2016 511 pm Sounds inspiring.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Down the Escape Hatch In Miranda Julys The Future never mind the defeated protagonistseven the cats a little fatalistic. By David Edelstein Published Jul 24 2011 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Roadside Attractions) In her second feature The Future Miranda July has the look of a disappointed ghost that cant fully materialize. Her eyes are the palest blue her skin less milky than skim-milky her body never quite seizing the space. Her panpipe voice is all from the head devoid of chest tones of airwhich might account for both her light-headed aura and her evident gift for self-hypnosis for going back in time to evoke the helpless little girl she once was. The character she played in her first feature Me and You and Everyone We Know was most at home in her cozy bedroom playing with puppets and its easy to imagine July writing scripts that way On some level shell always be a solo performer. But that doesnt hurt her as a dramatist surprisingly. In Julys universe were all solo performers and the more creative the performance the better the chance of connectingmaking a dancewith another soloist. When the creative impulse dies you get the discordant loneliness of The Future. The movie has a frame thats both whimsical and wrenching narration by a scratchy little voice (Julys) thats meant to belong to a cat seen largely as a pair of puppet paws. (Her name is Paw Paw.) The idea is that this cat born in the wild injured and unloved is scheduled to be adopted by an unmarried L.A. couple Sophie (July) and Jason (Hamish Linklater) and the thought makes Paw Paw warm inside They petted me and I accidentally made that sound that said I am a cat and I belong to you and upon making the sound I felt it to be true. But the couples sudden realization that in 30 days (when the sick Paw Paw can leave the shelter) theyll be tied down to a dependent creature (symbolizing a human child or just the burdens of adulthood) fills them with dread. Jason works from their tiny apartment in computer tech support while Sophie teaches (without enthusiasm) dance to little girls. They still have big dreams. But theyre both says Jason five years from 40 which (he adds) is the new 50 after which those dreams will go unrealized. So they have 30 days to be free whimsical spirits and do something big. See AlsoWriting a Duet With Miranda July This could be the premise of a zany comedy but the mood of The Future is from the outset defeatistannoyingly defeatist to be frank. This is one unfun couple. Jason accepts a job selling trees door to door for an environmental group but shows neither faith nor ingenuity. Hes hopelessly ineffectual. Sophie vows to create perform and post on YouTube 30 dances in 30 days but loses the thread on day one. To overcome her paralysis she phones a stranger whose number she finds on the back of a drawing Jason bought. That brings her to Marshall (David Warshofsky) a fiftyish single father with a well-appointed house in the Valley. Meeting him she robotically turns her back and hikes up her skirt so he can take her from behind. Marshall and his house seem like a quick ladder out of the slough of despond. The Future will be an unpleasant shock to many fans of Me and You and Everyone We Know which had its share of dark (and transgressive) elements but was leavened by deadpan jokes romance and moments of blissful transcendence. This ones unleavenedand motorless and squirmy with no safe harbors. I hated watching it almost as much as I loved watching Me and You. But by the end Id come around. July is often derided as self-consciously dotty but those dots are connected. Her life is a hunt for modes of self-expression for peoples creative escape hatches from the (transient) here and (ephemeral) now. An old man (Joe Putterlik) whom Jason meets through a Pennysaver ad displays a series of holiday cards handmade for his wife that are full of bracingly lewd verses. Marshalls daughter Gabriella (Isabella Acres) decides to bury herself in a backyard hole in which she vows to spend the nightand then hours later comes weeping to the door in need of love and a hot bath the full realization of her little-match-girl life having just sunk in. Sophies final quasi-dance inside one of her shirts is a physical meditation on entrapmentand an astonishing distillation of her journey. July is working as hard as any artist alive to find new forms to express the dread of formlessness. The Future has one failed creation Linklaters Jason whos too morose and closed-down too much a mirror imagealmost an incestuous reflectionof Sophies immobilization. July has given him a vaguely artistic impulsehe says he can stop timebut its more vague than artistic. On the other hand Julys failure of imagination might also be a sign of her integrity. Theres no future with a guy with no faith in the future. The makers of Crazy Stupid Love Glenn Ficarra and John Requa are too sane and (commercially) smart to make the craziness consequential and stupidity ruinous After the whirlpools of Miranda July were back on the rom-com mainland. But the movie has an unexpectedly high proportion of delights to groaners and its full of actors youll want to seereal actors like Ryan Gosling Julianne Moore and Emma Stone their edges not blunted by years of making witless buddy movies and chick flicks. Gosling alarmingly sleek and muscular plays a trust-fund-wealthy pickup virtuoso who helps broken newly dumped nebbish Steve Carell rediscover his manhood by teaching him how to dress and chat up the ladiesthough sweetie-pie Carell still moons over Moore his first and only love who slept with her smarmy colleague (Kevin Bacon) and is now a wreck of wayward emotions. This is the sort of quasi-farcical picture in which Carells 13-year-old son (Jonah Bobo) longs for his 17-year-old babysitter (Analeigh Tipton) who longs for Carell who spies on Moore The script by Dan Fogelman is unusually and gratifyingly bisexuali.e. it boasts scenes from both the male and female points of view One of those scenes is a gem a keeper sharp-witted Stone and Gosling in his bachelor pad her pressing him to demonstrate his time-tested seduction routinewhile simultaneously falling for it. Stone is amazingly vivid. She looks hungry to act and sometimes just hungry as when she spontaneously bites Goslings shoulder in a wineshop.

Hot chicks who eat crickets. The ultimate muscle car named Medusa. Booby-trapped with the superficial pleasures of a summer movie writer-director Evan Glodells darkly exhilarating debut Bellflower is a pre-apocalyptic love story and the most emotionally (even literally) explosive critique of male insecurity since Fight Club. Glodell stars with Tyler Dawson as mechanically inclined buds whose anarchic collaboration is threatened by a magnetic but volatile woman. While in NYC to flex Medusas guns at an auto show Glodell sat down to discuss what shouldnt be tried at home kids.Filmmaking aside when did you learn to build such dangerous toys? I was a tinkerer when I was a kid. I would mess around with electronics and then I got into Tesla coils and anything I could make high-voltage. When I was in middle school I started building bombs because thats fun when youre a young boy right?At the risk of incriminating us both what did you make them with? Whatever we could get our hands on. Wed take apart firecrackers. Dry-ice bombs were the easiest. I never made a pipe bomb because it seemed sketchy but you can empty CO2 containers fill them up with gunpowder and put wicks in them. That makes a pretty serious explosive. I remember making a bomb out of those disposable candles and throwing one in the garage to mess with my brother and his friends. It was the first time it hit me that what I was doing wasnt safe. No one got hurt but it was loud.What inspired the toxic romance at the heart of Bellflower? I went through a breakup--it was the most devastating thing that has happened to me. At the time I was obsessively making weird little projects and short films and I started writing about it. The first half of the movie was going to be pretty and happy and the second half was this terrible destroying of all that. Other ideas came in like the characters building this car something that my friend and I joked about ""Someday well have a car like that and that will enable us to be super-powerful like Mad Max.""So now that Medusa exists are you empowered? I dont know but I really like it. Its a bit silly in reality because you cant even drive anywhere. By the time I park like to go to 7-Eleven to get cigarettes theres someone waiting outside the car. Its always bros who are like ""What kind of engine do you got in there?"" It takes twice as long to get anything done.How do you feel about those who have decried your film as nihilistic or misogynistic? I literally would destroy [the film] if I thought it was a negative thing. There are scenes that are supposed to be like nightmares. A confused young guy is getting his heart ripped out by a girl or at least thats the way he sees it. Hes having these awful images in his head. Some involve revenge because he doesnt know what to do. To me I was being honest and addressing the shit that dudes will never talk about. I knew there was a danger that people were going to judge me. Is it true that your Oscilloscope contract has a clause requiring you to build a flamethrower for Beastie Boy and film distributor Adam ""MCA"" Yauch? Yes there is. We have to deliver them two flamethrowers. One regular and one child-size. I think its for his son. Its legally binding.Bellflower opens August 5 (Oscilloscope Laboratories) oscilloscope.netSummer Film PicksRooftop FilmsOngoing through August 20 Who wants to be trapped in a multiplex on a beautiful summer evening? The 15th-annual edition of this smartly curated open-air series boasts 23 features live music and madcap stunts The semi-pro wrestlers of the riveting verite doc Fake It So Real will take part in an on-site battle royale; the Dutch artist and subject of Convento presents an installation of dead-wildlife animatronics; and expect pure mayhem from the ""musical terrorists"" who star in the sublime Swedish comedy Sound of Noise. Rooftop Films various locations rooftopfilms.comOut of the BlueJune 3-9 In the late Dennis Hoppers mind a better film than Bertoluccis Luna and his own Easy Rider the actor-directors brilliant still shockingly subversive 1980 cherry bomb--revived here in a new 35mm print--is as sad and unsettling as dysfunctional-family dramas come. Days of Heavens Linda Manz steals it as an Elvis-loving teen punk reconnecting with her truck-driver dad (Hopper) freshly sprung from prison after drunkenly smashing into a busload of schoolchildren. Anthology Film Archives 32 Second Avenue anthologyfilmarchives.comBAMcinemaFESTJune 16-26 Nineteen New York premieres (and one world debut) light up BAMs third-annual showcase for new festival treasures and repertory curiosities opening with SXSW Audience Award winner Weekend. Dont miss the freewheeling comic snark of The Color Wheel the psychosexual jealousy bubbling beneath Green French actor and filmmaker Mathieu Amalrics bawdy burlesque-girls dramedy Tournee and some truly must-see docs (Dragonslayer Last Days Here The Ballad of Genesis amp; Lady Jaye). Brooklyn Academy of Music 30 Lafayette Avenue Brooklyn bam.orgPage One Inside the New York TimesJune 17 Whether youre getting ink on your hands or currently experiencing digital eye strain theres something to be gleaned about the mutating world of journalism from Andrew Rossis delightful fly-on-the-wall peek within the Gray Ladys newsroom. Discussing 21st-century ethics and concerns as the WikiLeaks controversy unfolds in real time the film is at its most entertaining when embedded with sandpaper-voiced veteran reporter David Carr who approaches his beat with a sharp wit and uncompromising saltiness. Magnolia Pictures in limited release magpictures.comNew York Asian Film FestivalJuly 1-14 Celebrating a decade of bat-shit nutty thrills Subway Cinemas genre-busting extravaganza will host special guest Tsui Hark for ""Wu Xia Hong Kongs Flying Swordsmen"" a sidebar featuring the directing legends kung-fu spectacular Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame. Fresh from Cannes Na Hong-jins The Yellow Sea headlines ""Sea of Revenge New Korean Thrillers"" and thats just the beginning. Punk-rock Buddhist monks Karate-fighting robots that transform into motorcycles Egad The Film Society of Lincoln Center West 65th Street and Broadway filmlinc.comTabloidJuly 15 After the sobering politics of Standard Operating Procedure and The Fog of War Oscar-winning documentarian Errol Morris returns to his eccentric early roots with--no not a counter-argument to Page One--but a hilariously bonkers saga that indeed made headlines. In the late 70s beauty queen Joyce McKinney flew to the U.K. kidnapped her former beau and chained him to a bed to ""deprogram"" his Mormon beliefs of chastity. Crazy but charismatic McKinney tells her rationalized side of a story whose twists are unthinkable. IFC Films in limited release ifcfilms.comEssential Pre-CodeJuly 15-August 11 1930s Hollywood was at its most exhilarating before the Hays Code suppressed all the innuendo raciness and creative rebellion which will titillate new generations in Film Forums four-week fete. Take in the uncensored version of Baby Face (starring Barbara Stanwyck as a corporate ladder-climbing prostitute) and new 35mm prints of Sailors Luck The Match King Jewel Robbery and Heat Lightning. Each Thursday salutes suave actor Warren William (""The Heel of Heels"") and Tuesdays offer triple features for one admission. Film Forum 209 West Houston Street filmforum.orgThe FutureJuly 29 Following 2005s Me and You and Everyone We Know Miranda Julys long-awaited second feature may theoretically seem too twee since its self-questioning drama about a quixotic thirtysomething couple (July and Hamish Linklater) in existential crisis features YouTube dance projects and narration by a dying stray cat. However this wonderfully whimsical examination into the fear of cosmic insignificance is so deeply touching and honest (think Ikiru starring Silver Lake hipsters) you just might need a stiff drink afterward.
