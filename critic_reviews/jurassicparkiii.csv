Pic has that unmistakable feeling of a franchise being severed from its creative roots. Theres more than a few spirals of DNA missing from the script of ""Jurassic Park III"" an all-action helter-skelter dont-forget-to-buy-the-computer-game ride that makes the two previous installments look like models of classic filmmaking. Showing all the signs of having been stripped back at a late stage into a lean 91-minute chase machine -- and to hell with pacing and character development -- pic has that unmistakable feeling of a franchise being severed from its creative roots with considerable confusion about what to put in its place. Watch for a juicy opening followed by a faster than usual falloff for this latest seg of the dino saga which if the series ever makes it to ""IV"" will be seen as a pit stop for refueling rather than a full lap around the track. Except for the visual effects the movie has a hand-me-down feel. The first two installments used largely the same key talent behind the lens and two key actors (Jeff Goldblum Richard Attenborough) in front of it giving them a homogeneous feel. With ""JP III"" however the scripts not based on a Michael Crichton novel and -- aside from Stan Winston and a few others on the dino side of things -- theres an all new crew on the tech side. Even with Steven Spielberg in the coachs chair theres an unmistakable sense that the reserve team has gone in to bat. Opening with an OK teaser sequence in which a young kid (Trevor Morgan) and an adult (Mark Harelik) are attacked by an unseen thing when parasailing over Isla Sorna pic adopts a real-time stance. Its eight years after the original debacle at John Hammonds theme park on nearby Isla Nublar and Hammonds company InGen is a memory. One of his original invitees Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) is struggling to maintain funding for his paleontology research. Grant is keen to develop his theory of velociraptor intelligence but auds at his fundraising lectures only want to hear more tales about Jurassic Park. Grant is approached by Paul Kirby (William H. Macy) and his wife Amanda (Tea Leoni) to guide an aerial tour of Isla Sorna the so-called Site B (and setting for ""The Lost World"") where InGen secretly bred the dinos and where theyve been on the loose for almost a decade. Presenting themselves as wealthy thrill-seekers who want to buzz the quarantined island the couple asks the cash-strapped Grant to name his price. These establishing reels have a hasty feel that prefigures many of the films later problems. Laura Dern briefly reprises her role of Ellie from the first movie; other characters are clumsily introduced and thinly drawn. Result is that when Kirby against Grants wishes tries to land the plane on the island the viewer is plunged into immediate action with only the barest idea of who most of the characters are. Pics first major action sequence is a highly kinetic screamfest with the plane crashing into some tree-tops and its occupants being attacked by a spinosaurus the movies much-touted new villain. As the fuselage rolls this way and that the sequence plays like a B-movie version of the dangling Winnebago sequence in ""Lost World"" -- heavy on screams and visceral shocks but lacking in deep-seated skin-crawling fear. The truth is that the lumbering spino despite its larger size longer jaw and fancy back fin just doesnt cut it as a substitute T-Rex. With none of the T-Rexs extensive backgrounding this new addition to Winstons dino lineup looks more like an escapee from a Japanese monster movie. Following an attempted escape in another plane pic settles into one long chase movie. The two previous installments had varied situations and cross-plots in which the humans and animals interacted plus a larger story arc in which the action sequences were implanted. Here the majority of the movie takes place in jungle settings with the cast running between them as predators arrive on the scene. Smidgen of a script cooked up by three credited (and two uncredited) writers soon reveals that Kirby and Amanda are in fact a divorced couple searching for their 14-year-old son Eric and Amandas boyfriend Ben -- the parasailing pair attacked in the opening teaser. ""JP III"" thus becomes a very different movie from the previous two pics in which human hubris received its just deserts when protective technology proved inadequate. Here the protagonists are never in control Theyre dino-dinner from the get-go. In essence pic becomes a prehistoric variation on another genre Americans under threat in a hostile foreign environment. Unsurprisingly the final line of dialogue is ""Lets go home."" Direction by Joe Johnston who cut his teeth as a visual f/x designer before graduating to effects showpieces ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" and ""Jumanji"" keeps the action ticking but without the broader sweep he brought to adventure saga ""The Rocketeer."" Blame that largely on the script; lame attempts at humor and characterization make even the few surviving moments of non-action dialogue painful to sit through. As the only hardened specialist of the group Neills paleontologist is largely reduced to looking worried and uttering apocalyptic warnings. Grants protege Billy (Alessandro Nivola) is thinly drawn and even the usually reliable Macy looks like he signed for the wrong movie. Following her career rebound with ""The Family Man"" Leoni is a major disappointment stuck in an annoying role in which her character spends a lot of time screaming and running around. As the sensible young Eric Morgan acquits himself best bypassing most of the young-teen cliches and sharing one above-par quiet moment with Neill. Still pics effects are extremely impressive with the creatures rendered with a smoothness and believability that puts even the first two installments in the shade. Whether caught in the middle of a stampede face to face with intelligent velociraptors or gazing from afar the human cast members become of a piece with their prehistoric co-stars thanks to superb work by Winston and the ILM team that blurs the line between live action and CG. But with so little going on among the humans the sheer amount of creature work robs the critters of much of their menace and surprise. Most impressive among the newcomers -- and eerily pre-figured in the final shot of ""The Lost World"" -- are the flying pteranodons whose encounter with the hapless humans in a giant aviary is worth the price of admission alone. For a brief spell the movie manages to recapture the shock of the new that drove Spielbergs original movies; thereafter pic tails off in search of a finale that never arrives. Other credits are functional rather than atmospheric with Don Davis score faithfully recycling John Williams original themes and Shelly Johnsons workaday lensing at its best in the impressively clammy studio-created jungles rather than the Hawaiian exteriors. Final reel which most shows signs of last-minute cutting leaves room for a sequel featuring the pteranodons.

Macy Sam Neill Laura Dern John Diehl Trevor Morgan Alessandro Nivola; Director Joe Johnston; Author Peter Buchman Alexander Payne Jim Taylor; Producer (group) Amblin Entertainment Universal; Release Date Wide 07/18/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 92; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Posted August 9 2006 -- 1200 AM EDT In one of the only enticing sequences of Jurassic Park III Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) the square-souled paleontologist in the ""Indiana Jones"" hat (as if) attempts to lead his crew one by one through a thick white fog over a rickety bridge only to discover that theyre all inside a giant birdcage. Halfway across the bridge we meet one of the ""birds"" a cawing pteranodon with vast leathery wings and an anvil head that cocks and bites with auto-jut purpose. There are baby pteranodons too - theyre not quite as intimidating though they do want to be fed - and all of these creatures are fun and arresting to behold because like the best dinosaurs from the previous ""Jurassic Park"" films they attack with a beak-snapping viciousness that seems purely hardwired. They have aggression but no awareness. Theyre OBs (original beasties) the epic channelers of the earths primordial wrath. In a strange way the other dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park III"" the first of the ""Jurassic"" films not to be directed by executive producer Steven Spielberg (the reins have been taken over by Joe Johnston who made ""Jumanji"" and ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"") seem a bit too much like comfy old friends. Take for instance the big guys - the ground-shuddering T. rex and a new even more gargantuan dino called the Spinosaurus which thunders and gnashes exactly like a T. rex except that this one has the elongated bumpy mouth of a crocodile as well as a rather mild-looking fin. By all rights these two jaws giants should be terrifying but for all their stalking horizontal menace they have a way of lumbering a half-dozen convenient steps behind their prey; no one in the movie ever appears in serious danger of getting chomped. Then of course there are the raptors who are so smart this time that they can actually talk to each other (though not in English so I cant comment on whether their dialogue is superior to that of the humans). Were meant to be wowed by their lethal intelligence but all I could think of was how routine their prancing quick-draw movements had become. You can call a raptor a genius but minus Spielbergs playfully sinister hide-and-seek choreography hes just a lizard with an attitude. ""Jurassic Park III"" has no pretentions to be anything more than a goose-bumpy fantasy theme-park ride for kids but its such a routine ride. Spielbergs wizardry is gone and his balletic light touch as well and that gives too much of this 90-minute movie over to the duller-than-dull characters Dr.Grant and his scolding speeches on the perils of tampering with nature William H. Macy and Tea Leoni as a reconciling divorced couple who kidnap Grant in order to find their kid who was somehow abandoned on Isla Sorna (yeah right). Its time by now to abandon ""Jurassic Park"" before its entertainment value becomes utterly extinct.

"Jurassic Park III | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jurassic-park-iii ) Jurassic Park III (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Relatively speaking Jurassic Park III is a disappointment of behemoth proportions. With Steven Spielberg gone from the directors chair (replaced by Jumanjis Joe Johnston) the Jurassic Park saga has sunk down to its B-grade monster movie roots. The concept of a human character has been replaced by a cardboard cut-out each of which serves one of two purposes to run away from the dinosaurs or to be eaten by them. The ""synthespians"" of Final Fantasy would have been perfectly at home in Jurassic Park III. Theres no need whatsoever for human actors. The first Jurassic Park was a well-paced adventure movie wrapped in a magical package that used state-of-the-art special effects and digital sound to make us believe that dinosaurs could once again roam the earth. The Lost World Jurassic Park II while panned in some corners basically offered more of the same - tightly-paced action and adventure. Unfortunately Jurassic Park III not only re-hashes the two previous outings (hapless humans hunted by hungry dinosaurs) but does it with far less style and human interest. This time around theres no build-up to the first appearance of the dinosaurs - theyre suddenly there. Character interaction never a strong suit in the series is worse than perfunctory - its virtually non-existent. Every action piece is staged in a generic fashion leaving no room for suspense or tension. And the whole movie is over so fast (sans credits only about 1 hour 20 minutes) that it hardly seems to have happened. The plot insofar as there is a plot has paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) traveling to Isla Sorna (""Site B"") as the paid guide for Paul and Amanda Kirby (William H. Macy and TA(c)a Leoni) an estranged husband and wife searching for their son Eric (Trevor Morgan) who is lost on the island. Grant accompanied by his assistant Billy Brennan (Alessandro Nivola) soon finds himself in the same kind of life-and-death situation he ended up in during the original Jurassic Park being chased by Raptors T-Rexs and the ""new"" Spinosaurus. Also along for the ride are a few other individuals (Michael Jeter John Diehl) who practically have ""Dinosaur Fodder"" stenciled on their foreheads. Its a sad observation to note that the best scene in the movie - a reunion between Grant and his former sidekick Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern in a cameo) - features no dinosaurs. Everything that transpires on Isla Sorna is repetitious and largely uninteresting. Admittedly there are some new dinosaurs (including a few that fly) but they act in basically the same way that all of the others do. The raptors have been elevated to super-genius status (they now talk to each other albeit not in English - I was half-expecting subtitles) while our old friend the T-Rex has only a brief ignoble cameo. The special effects while still impressive seem to have been done on the cheap - some of the dinosaurs especially the new ones look less polished. Jurassic Park III lacks a legitimate climax - it sort of ends with a big deus ex machina bang. This is in keeping with the films overall poor structure. It doesnt have much of a beginning a middle or an ending - causing me to wonder if there was a finished script before filming started (according to comments made by two of the actors there wasnt). The movie vainly attempts to replicate the human relationships of the first two movies a low-key romance between two adults (Grant and Sattler in Jurassic Park; Jeff Goldblums Ian Malcolm and Julianne Moores Sarah Harding in The Lost World) and a adult/child bonding (Grant and Hammonds grandchildren in Jurassic Park; Malcolm and his daughter in The Lost World). In this case however there is no chemistry between the couple William H. Macy and TA(c)a Leoni and Grants interaction with Eric simply doesnt work. It is forced and unnatural. The filmmakers obviously hoped that bringing back Sam Neill would lend an air of legitimacy to this production that it might not otherwise have possessed. And to give Neill support they have added a group of top-notch character actors - William H. Macy Michael Jeter John Diehl and hunk-in-waiting Alessandro Nivola. The only serious instance of miscasting is TA(c)a Leoni who is farther out of her element than Julianne Moore was in The Lost World. Yet because the characters are so thinly written no amount of acting experience can make a difference. Given the material he has to work with Neill can be forgiven for his lackluster performance. It was probably foolish to hope for something new or original to surface during the course of Jurassic Park III - after all the formula has long been established for this sort of movie - but it shouldnt have been too much to expect a little excitement. Instead in keeping with 2001s roster of lackluster sequels we have been presented with something that is uninspired and obligatory. It fits right in with the likes of Crocodile Dundee in L.A. The Mummy Returns and Dr. Dolittle 2. At the end Jurassic Park III leaves the door wide open for a Jurassic Park IV. I can only hope that a justifiably poor box office showing will slam that door shut with a louder thud than the sound made by an approaching T-Rex.

Starring Sam Neill William H. Macy and Tea Leoni. Directed by Joe Johnston. (PG-13. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Jurassic Park III"" has the integrity of a solid B-movie. If it lacks the inspiration of ""Jurassic I"" it also lacks the bloat and self-importance of most summer blockbusters. No one was trying to make an epic here. This is a monster movie -- 92 minutes lots of action lots of green legs stomping get in get out. Flying dinosaurs make an appearance and while theyre not as big an innovation as the advertising might suggest they do make for a couple of nifty sequences. In the obligatory opening disaster a man (Mark Harelik) and his stepson are para-sailing off the island hoping to see some dinosaurs. They wont go to the island so the dinosaurs ever hospitable fly out to greet them. . . . Oh no It has been eight years since the first ""Jurassic Park"" -- years in which audiences have come to take the miraculous for granted. In the new picture were treated to a dinosaur stampede brilliantly rendered and for the characters caught in it its as distressing as ever. Yet for us it registers about as powerfully as an old newsreel about the running of the bulls in Pamplona. Likewise though director Joe Johnston cranks up the John Williams themes at the sight of brachiosauruses gamboling contentedly in their vegetarian paradise for audiences its just another day. The public has become so dinosaur savvy that it knows the herbivores from the carnivores. All this is a measure of the series success but it also suggests that this new installment may be the end of the line. For all its economy and directness ""Jurassic III"" doesnt do anything new and the impact of doing the old stuff just isnt there anymore. The only possible direction for yet another sequel would be nihilism The dinosaurs take over the planet eat everybody roll credits. Sam Neill who skipped the second installment is back as paleontologist Alan Grant who like Harrison Fords heroes always looks vaguely disgusted about something. Not that anything bad has happened yet -- hes disgusted in advance. Grant is still researching dinosaurs but one thing he knows for sure He is never going back to dino-island heck no no way forget about it. But he does agree to fly over it with a wealthy and adventurous married couple (William H. Macy and Tea Leoni) who open their checkbook and keep adding zeros until he cant resist. To watch the scene in which Grant breaks down and agrees to take the money is to wonder if thats how Neill looked when he agreed to make this sequel. The dinosaurs show up early -- thats a great virtue of ""Jurassic Park III. "" Thanks to a plot turn not worth revealing Grant and his party end up landing on the island and thats when the movie becomes an almost nonstop struggle for survival. A T. rex takes an early interest in the passenger cabin of their airplane much the way boys take an interest in tin cans. Its miraculous that the characters survive 10 minutes but the movie is good at presenting hopeless situations and steering the characters out of them. This time Grant has new information based on his decades of research. The raptors are really really smart. ""They were smarter than dolphins"" he says ""smarter than primates."" Smarter than audiences? He doesnt say. But the raptors are capable of setting traps and coordinating their attacks. They even have their own language. If theres another sequel expect subtitles. There are two ways to make a monster movie. One way is to make audiences hate the monsters. The other is to pull a ""King Kong"" and make audiences like one particular monster. ""Jurassic Park III"" tries to do something impossible -- to make us feel warm toward the monsters in those rare moments when theyre not trying to eat the cast. This blunts some of the emotional effectiveness of the story as if the filmmakers were ambivalent about making a monster movie in an environmentally aware era. This film contains graphic sci-fi violence.

"USATODAY.com - No romp in the park Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 07/18/2001 - Updated 0952 AM ET No romp in the park By Mike Clark USA TODAY Jurassic Park III (out of four) Stars Tea Leoni Trevor Morgan William H. Macy Sam Neill Director Joe Johnston Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense sci-fi tension and violence Gertrude Stein may have said a ""rose is a rose is a rose"" and so on but in Hollywood a three is a three is a three -- and always will be. Conjuring up repressed memories of the famously miserable Jaws 3-D Jurassic Park III is a lot of stagnant storytelling trapped underneath prehistoric footprints even if the flying pteranodons finally get their day in the series. This script never does though despite contributions by the clever Election team of Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor. Read more Video Jurassic Park III trailer Related Fossil discoveries fuel a revised prehistory The story would have us believe that a mom (Tea Leoni) would allow her 14-year-old son (Trevor Morgan) to paraglide within 500 miles of a no-longer-secret dinosaur-packed island. And that when the kid lands there after the inevitable accident his folks wouldnt drum up a media blitz to get him back. Instead estranged mom and dad (William H. Macy) trick Sam Neills crusty Dr. Alan Grant (back after smartly dodging the second Jurassic film) into revisiting his own presumably repressed memories. They pretend to be a wealthy couple who request a private airborne tour that only the idle rich could afford. When the plane lands Neill momentarily enlivens the movie with the dopiest dialogue aimed at Macy ""Its time you did some explaining Mr. Kirby."" One could say the same to Universal Pictures. This is the kind of cinematic commerce that makes good actors such as Neill and Macy look bad -- and renders bad actors who deliver a couple of lines then get munched unwatchable. With a calculating eye on the target audience it further annoys by making the kid almost the smartest one in the movie. This time the raptors are smarter too communicating in a manner that recalls Tarzan beckoning his animal pals. Cool-looking from a theme park standpoint the pteranodons rate a lot of footage yet the human characters are so dull that we never care when they are carried off for some pecking and snacking. The movie finally degenerates into a reconciliation soaper The Parent Trap Redux except that here the parents are in a trap for real catching on after finding huge bird droppings on a rickety rail. Even Steven Spielberg seemed stymied for something fresh in first sequel The Lost World. So where does JPIII rank in director Joe Johnstons filmography? Last on the list if you count Honey I Shrunk the Kids October Sky The Rocketeer and Jumanji. Even the special effects alone arent worth the price of admission. It might be tempting to say ""Bring on Barney"" but the purple one already has a cameo.

This third film in the dinosaur franchise picks up eight years after the original ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and once again features Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) one of the worlds foremost paleontologists. Laura Dern is also back in an extremely reduced (but pivotal) role as Grants paleobotanist colleague Ellie Sattler. In the first movie (for anyone who has been living under a rock for the last few years) Grant was lured by industrialist John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) into his fateful journey to Jurassic Park by the promise of grant money to continue his research into the history of dinosaurs. Located on the remote island of Isla Nublar off the coast of Costa Rica the park was to be a unique tourist attraction where people could interact with genetically engineered dinosaurs. To say things didnt work as planned would be a gross understatement. Many of the islands inhabitants become dino snacks and Grant and Sattler barely escaped with their lives. Isla Nublar and the adjacent Isla Sorna are now under quarantine. Both have become primordial breeding grounds for all types of prehistoric creatures including many dinos that were not a part of the original Jurassic Park. Both forbidden locations have become magnets for thrill-seekers who illegally fly over them in private planes or cruise alongside them in boats hoping to catch a glimpse of the prehistoric residents.
