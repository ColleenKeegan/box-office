"Twelve movie review The terrible troubles of filthy-rich teens poorly told |       NJ.com comments Twelve movie review The terrible troubles of filthy-rich teens poorly told Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 06 2010 at 827 AM View/Post Comments Jonathan WENK/Unit PhotographyChace Crawford stars as ""White Mike"" the anti-hero of ""Twelve."" By Stephen Whitty STAR-LEDGER STAFF Every generation gets its own novel about how special and decadent and doomed they are -- whether they want it or not. The books have had the same things in common since F. Scott Fitzgerald last prowled Princeton. They feature beautiful and damned rich kids and a (marginally) more sensitive hero. They are lit by the bright lights of the big city and fueled by illegal substances. Some of these books are finely written and deeply felt. Others are by Bret Easton Ellis. Nick McDonells ""Twelve"" was one of the most recent examples published in 2002 when the author was 17. In it insanely rich Manhattan teens dressed up in haute couture took over their vacationing parents townhouses and had parties that would shame Caligula. Think of it as ""Gossip Girl Gone Wild."" Or since Joel Schumacher directed the movie adaptation call this version ""St. Elmos Crack"" -- full of carefully stubbled young actors only barely covered-up young actresses flashy camera work tearful self-pity and very little authentic drama. ""Gossip Girl"" star Chace Crawford appears as White Mike the movies handsome antihero who sells marijuana but refuses to drink or do drugs himself. (According to the movies odd moral compass this makes him far worse than the people he sells to.) When hes not pushing pot White Mike stands on rooftops and looks pensive while a faux-poetic Kiefer Sutherland narrates the teenagers thoughts. Mostly White Mike thinks about his dead mother. This makes him sad. Then his cell rings and he goes off to sell another ounce. This is the sort of thing that probably felt very profound to the young privileged (and fortuitously well-connected) McDonell. But on the screen with Crawfords ennui-by-GQ grooming and Schumachers overheated direction it all comes off as faintly absurd. Movie Review Twelve (R) Hannover House (98 min.) Directed by Joel Schumacher. With Chace Crawford. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains underage everything including sex nudity drugs alcohol and gory violence. Stephen Whittys review ONE AND A HALF STARS A rich-girl virgin who sleeps with 100 teddy bears becomes a hollow-eyed addict after a single dose of a new designer drug (and then her teddy bears start talking to her). A misfit roid head who keeps a tank of piranhas in his bedroom suddenly goes psycho with a samurai sword. And then every so often we cut to a blank white-walled dream set where people revel in their sad sad memories. Its like someone decided to parody ""Kids"" but forgot to put in any jokes. And instead just made a Generation Yecch melodrama that fakes all the truth its supposed to be reporting and lingers lovingly over every beautiful barely clad druggy even while saying how dreadful -- no really just dreadful -- it all is. Occasionally White Mike talks about people who deserve membership in a mythical Hypocrites Club. I suggest he take another look at his own movie and keep a special eye on the credits.

The Upper East Side. Spring break. Preppies. Charlie is on drugs. He is sad. Hunter is on drugs. He is sad. Jessica is on drugs. She is sad. White Mike doesnt do drugs but sells them to all of the above. Hes extra-super sad because his mom died. The drug everyone seems to be on is ""Twelve"" but the more profoundly mood-altering substance is a less glam one self-pity. Based on the novel by then-preppie Nick McDonell the movie promises insights or at least insidery gossip. Instead it feels as shopworn as a dusty VHS tape of ""Less Than Zero."" Chace Crawford of ""Gossip Girl"" has star power -- hes a de-wussified John Krasinski -- as angsty dealer White Mike who is beset by blinding-white daydreams about his dead mom. He doesnt know his supplier (Curtis Jackson a k a 50 Cent) has shot Mikes doofus cousin Charlie a crime for which their friend Hunter (Philip Ettinger) may take the fall. PHOTOS CHACE CRAWFORD The shame-ridden Mike hides his sordid job from his childhood pal (Emma Roberts) a hot chocolate-sipping sweetie who is the only teen in town not to know where everyone is scoring their drugs. Doesnt she speak to anyone? Meanwhile everyone -- including a frustrated virgin (Rory Culkin) a pampered princess (Emily Meade) and a steroid-pumped psycho (Billy Magnussen) who has sneaked home from rehab -- prepares for the standard decadent party scene. While we wait for the movie to tell us which characters we dont care about will die Kiefer Sutherland sneers through an oh-so-world-weary narration that informs us everyone is really shallow and spoiled and just wants to be famous. Really? Directed (uh-oh) by ""Batman amp; Robin"" director Joel Schumacher ""Twelve"" begs for a satiric touch. Instead it presents cliche as revelation via imitation hard-guy blather. (Sutherland so often describes degenerate scenes as ""thats how it is"" that he starts to sound like Ron Burgundy trying out a new sign-off.) The scene in which one girl gets wasted in her undies and undulates in a mound of teddy bears she thinks are talking to her (in helium-kissed baby talk) about the ""Today"" show is an instant camp classic. Another giggle-inducer is the way Sutherland sounds increasingly demented as he angrily reads off a list of synonyms for sex. In the final minutes ""Twelve"" realizes it has nowhere to go (""Kids dont do drugs""? So uncool). So it turns into a gun movie. The takeaway? Beware of all those pistol-packing Hotchkiss students roaming Park Avenue.

"Movie review Twelve - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review TwelveDestructive Upper East Side adolescents run crazy. Director Joel Schumacher provides the flourishes that leave viewers numb.August 06 2010|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Twenty-five years ago Demi Moore huddled in an empty room with billowing curtains for Joel Schumachers ""St. Elmos Fire"" and an iconic if cheeseball visual cue for spoiled-youth loneliness was born. In ""Twelve"" the directors latest dive into the indiscretions of adolescent brats the possibilities are endless a drug-addled teenage girls hallucination that her stuffed bears are talking to her a broodingly handsome drug dealers mopey timeout in a street-construction hole or maybe that hair-trigger rich kid in the police interrogation room breaking down on a phone call from absent Daddy. So much to choose from. A slickly dark-edged pity party for damaged Upper East Side adolescents ""Twelve"" is adapted from a 2003 novel that earned a good measure of acclaim because its author Nick McDonell was just 17 when he took aim at his peers. McDonells familiarity with the hedonistic ups and downs of Manhattans entitled youth gave the book some ""Less Than Zero""-style cred but Schumacher is at the other end of the age spectrum. A veteran glitzmeister with a spotty track record mixing style and emotional depth his handling of the material a adapted by Jordan Melamed a is less harrowing wake-up call than fast-moving picture window on the smorgasbord of teenage sin. (The title refers to a powerful new drug earning hot status among the films moneyed pleasure-seekers.) The action takes place over a long weekend of depravity and tragedy bookended by a couple of back-pages gunshots in a Harlem hallway at the beginning and a citywide headlines worth of them during a climactic townhouse bacchanal at the end. In between the kids are not all right but OMG they suffer beautifully. When were allowed to appreciate their predicaments that is. Because although we meet more than a dozen characters a including trench-coated pusher White Mike (""Gossip Girl"" star Chace Crawford) fame-seeking manipulative hottie Sara (Esti Ginzburg) and self-destructive party girl Jessica (Emily Meade) a more accurately were told everything about these characters thanks to the ubiquitous presence of narrator Kiefer Sutherland. His near-constant growly ""Dragnet""-like briefings a background info in-the-moment headspace and philosophical context a are the surest sign the filmmakers had little confidence in the communicative power of the apprehensive faces on-screen. Which is a shame because the young cast has its standouts including Curtis Jackson as White Mikes supplier Emma Roberts as sweet-faced good girl Molly Rory Culkin as recessive hanger-on Chris and Billy Magnussen as Chris unhinged older brother Claude whose left-field purchase of a samurai sword is the kind of freaky act of roiling insecurity that in a better filmmakers hands would play as disturbing rather than campy. Then again for all the cautionary trappings inherent in a downward spiral like ""Twelve"" it ultimately falls victim to another kind of addict in that Schumacher cant keep himself from the kind of vibey camera and editing flourishes that facilitate only viewer numbness slo-mo for cool herky-jerky for loss of control white backgrounds for momentous flashbacks or silly detours like the contents of someones pockets. The stylistic distractions are such that when one character learns of the shooting death of his cousin it doesnt immediately trigger the fact that this was something depicted in the first act. Consider ""Twelve"" its own memory-retarding narcotic. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Miss BalaJanuary 20 2012Movie review Killing BonoNovember 11 2011Its tough being rich and pamperedSeptember 19 2007Answering for antics of `Gossip GirlJuly 23 2007MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewEntertainmentDrugCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-twelve-20100806,0,4719822.story",200,twelve3,twelve,latimes

An observer at close range of the specimens he wrote about McDonell powered his headline-grabbing book with on-the-ground authority amping up the action with precocious bravado and pushing the mesmerizing wreck-of-the-rich melodrama to a violent climax. The movie adaptation directed by Joel Schumacher covers all of McDonells ground. But between page and screen youthful immediacy has been lost replaced by effortful art direction that saddles the of-the-moment story with a dated Less Than Zero aesthetic heavy on the wardrobe and decor. In other news since the close of the last century The CWs popular Gossip Girl soap has claimed epic pop cultural ownership of the Upper East Side. Twelve isnt Gossip Girl nor does it want to be but some confusion is understandable when GGs Chace Crawford shows up not as golden boy Nate Archibald but as commoner White Mike the clean-living drug-dealing narrator-hero. (""Twelve"" is the name of a potent designer drug that turns at least one user into an addict.) The gleaming cast includes Curtis Jackson a.k.a. 50 Cent as another dealer Rory Culkin as a runt hungry for popularity and Emma Roberts as the one girl around whos wholesome and knew Mike when he was too. Twelve ogles the lost boys and girls as they make their mistakes. But unlike the novel the movie never really gets inside these kids who arent in the least all right.

Maybe you dont"" gravely intones Kiefer Sutherland the narrator of Joel Schumachers silly tone-deaf adaptation of Nick McDonells 2002 book about entitled Upper East Side teenage twerps. Famously published when its author was only 18 Twelve the book briskly moves along with the Didion-esque disdain of an insider--material that first-time screenwriter Jordan Melamed transforms into a hand-wringing cautionary tale with a tacked-on moral lesson and visions of a dead beatific mother. Gossip Girls Chace Crawford stars as White Mike a Camus-quoting prep-school dropout who refrains from using any of the substances he sells to his former classmates narcissists who are hurting deeply because their parents go on vacation without them reachable only by satellite phone. Though Crawfords bangs and facial hair are the most art-directed aspect of the movie hes costumed to look like a member of the Trenchcoat Mafia (Madison Avenue branch). But White Mike is not the psychopath of the story--that would be Claude (Billy Magnussen) who has left rehab and does something very bad at a party after Mom prefers talking with his younger brother Chris (Rory Culkin). Filthy-rich parents remember Your adolescent children really want to Skype with you when youre in St. Barts.

Hypocrisy sucks. Thats about as profound as it gets in director Joel Schumachers seen-it-all-before Sundance debut which seems rather conflicted on the subject itself. Circling a dozen or so characters ripped right out of ""Less Than Zero"" ""Twelve"" cant decide if its a cautionary tale or a lifestyle catalog. Based on then-17-year-old Nick McDonells novel ""Twelve"" feels like ersatz Bret Easton Ellis watered down for the ""Gossip Girl"" crowd (it even stars the latters Chace Crawford as its drug-dealing antihero). Not quite self-aware enough to become camp Schumachers trashy high-society soap could connect with younger auds. In the novel McDonell introduces his James Dean-looking main character with the words ""White Mike saw that movie American Beauty about a kid who is a drug dealer. ... The kid says that sometimes there is so much beauty in the world that sometimes you just cant take it. Fuck that thinks White Mike."" Its doubtful the real-life White Mikes of the world would find the movie version of ""Twelve"" any more authentic. Cluttered with too many characters and nothing much to say (despite long-winded narration delivered by Schumacher regular Kiefer Sutherland) the pic spends its first 12 minutes introducing all the sycophants and trust-fund kids in White Mikes circle. After his mothers death White Mike dropped out of school to peddle pot to these degenerates whom Sutherland introduces one by one with descriptions such as ""Tobias the hot male model."" Of his ex-classmates only Molly (Emma Roberts) ""gets"" White Mike. Whereas the other characters spend their time getting high (the title refers to a new street drug that combines the effects of cocaine and Ecstasy) shes always shown studying or working. If theres someone to root for in this sleazy stew it would be Molly though its White Mike who remains the films focus. If someone were to invent a drinking game triggered by every mention of White Mikes name auds would be dead before the first act climaxes. To compound the absurdity the moniker makes no sense now that Schumacher has transformed him from ""thin and pale like smoke"" to a dark-haired emo boy with two-day stubble. But thats the least of the problems with Jordan Melameds screenplay. For anyone willing to wade through the narration (e.g. ""If you dont want something youve got nothing"") and attempts of style (Schumacher itemizes the contents of one characters pockets against a white background) things fall apart pretty quickly. Events have been swapped from winter to spring break for instance though the onscreen labels inexplicably begin with ""Thursday."" That night White Mikes cousin Charlie (Jeremy Allen White) and another kid get shot by White Mikes supplier Lionel (Curtis Jackson). On Friday the cops haul in the wrong suspect and by Saturday things are poised to go horribly horribly wrong at ""the kind of party people lie and say they were at."" Connections to 2008 Sundance audience fave ""The Wackness"" seem inevitable though its hard to work up much sympathy for a drug dealer who looks as though he should be modeling mens underwear. Schumacher gets surprisingly good performances considering the number of young and inexperienced actors involved (adults hardly exist in this world of absentee parents) and the tech credits are strong if unusually tame for such sordid material.
