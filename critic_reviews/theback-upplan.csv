Jennifer Lopez is real shell have you know. As a recording artist she has touted her Bronx roots with singles like ""Jenny from the Block."" As an actress she has sought down-to-earth homegirl roles in several silly rom-coms such as ""Maid in Manhattan."" (Never mind the critical goodwill she earned from starring opposite George Clooney in the too-cool-for-school ""Out of Sight."") ""The Back-Up Plan"" is Lopezs latest bid for box-office gold. She plays a Manhattanite named Zoe who decides to become a single mom through artificial insemination because she can never meet the right guy. That is until -- J. Lo and behold -- her chance encounter with Stan (Alex OLoughlin from the short-lived 2007 TV series ""Moonlight"") immediately after her medical procedure. The fact that Stan is a dairy farmer would almost guarantee the film to be cheesy both figuratively and literally. He begins aggressively courting Zoe with persistence worthy of a stalker. Their budding romance blossoms at an alarming rate -- until she finally spills the beans about her pregnancy. Starting out as an improbable romantic fantasy ""The Back-Up Plan"" gradually devolves into movie night for yuppie newlyweds once the couple in the story has to cope with Stans fatherhood jitters. Just as in sitcoms every conflict and resolution often takes place here within the very same scene. The movie released by CBS Films reeks of the same bland made-for-TV aura as the companys inaugural offering ""Extraordinary Measures."" The Back-Up Plan (PG-13) Directed by Alan Poul. With Jennifer Lopez Alex OLoughlin Anthony Anderson. Now playing in New Jersey. Martin Tsais rating One and a half stars Ratings note The film contains sexual content including references some crude material and language. Even though Lopezs character is a self-sufficient businesswoman from the outset ""The Back-Up Plan"" appears to operate under the regressive anti-feminist presumption that single motherhood is by nature unfulfilling given the films unflattering depictions of a kooky support group for single moms. Its retrograde core values make Sam Mendes hipster parenthood-anxiety flick ""Away We Go"" seem post-modern by contrast. Lopez gamely degrades herself by belching snoring and stuffing her face for a laugh. But truth be told everything on offer here has been done better elsewhere. There are countless missed comedic opportunities while screenwriter Kate Angelo twice resorts to the lowest common denominator -- a poop joke. You know the film is worthless when the end-credit bloopers arent even funny.

Jennifer Lopez plays a woman who is artificially inseminated just before meeting Stan played by Alex OLoughlin. Photo PETER IOVINO  CBS FILMS The Back-Up Plan 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Chick flicks. You know them when you see them right? The lonely but gorgeous heroines the hunky but unthreatening heroes the life lessons dished out by fate and sardonic buddies. The Back-Up Plan qualifies on all counts Jennifer Lopez plays a beauteous single whos artificially inseminated moments before meeting Alex OLoughlins sensitive hunk of a goat farmer. But their story goes way way beyond standard chick-flickiness. The film actually belongs to a special subcategory called the Egg-Producing Hen Movie. As such it should appeal to anyone who has ever been pregnant thought about getting pregnant known someone whos been pregnant followed a pregnant womans postings on Facebook and/or thumbed through a copy of What To Expect While Youre Expecting . As a member of all five groups I laughed hysterically (and yes I know the origin of the word). But in the interest of balanced reporting I should add that the guy parked next to me at the screening -- a boyfriend who was there under duress -- emitted a series of low guttural noises suggesting profound psychological anguish. When it comes to the schmaltzier pronouncements in Kate Angelos screenplay (""everything makes sense all of a sudden"") youll feel his pain. Otherwise Alan Pouls feature directorial debut (before this he directed episodes of Big Love and helped produce Candyman) is an often riotous send-up of impending parenthood and its myriad transformations casting old age-old truisms inside modern dilemmas. Zoe (Lopez) is weepy barfy hungry horny. The usual. Her boyfriend Stan (OLaughlin) didnt know about the bun in the oven when he signed on for a little romance so hes feeling a bit dazed. Guiding Zoe through the wilds of human gestation is her chick-flick-ordained sardonic buddy Mona (Michaela Watkins my new favorite graduate of Saturday Night Live) who has four children and claims to hate them all. Guiding Stan is his own acerbic helper a nameless playground dad (Anthony Anderson) who plies him with juice boxes and sums up parenthood as the awful (such as poop) interrupted by the magical. Pouls direction and Xavier Perez Grobets cinematography run from unobtrusive to imaginative offering close-ups of painted toenails and whooshing zooms into the results of a pregnancy test. Lopez does a fine job mortifying herself in pursuit of physical humor. OLoughlin in the blander role acts hurt or shocked or besotted where required but its the supporting players who nearly steal the show. A single mothers support group and related water-birthing scene provide many such opportunities. And if Robert Klein does nothing else for the rest of his life I will always love him for the way he shouts a single noun -- four times with zest -- as Zoes obstetrician. Its a few brief seconds of chick-flick nirvana. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Bike Deals at Dicks Sporting Goods Up to 50% off Better Life Technology Garage Floor Cover for 130 + free...

The 2006 drama Bordertown set in Juarez-El Paso vanished without a trace amid scathing reviews and the romantic comedies that had become her stock in trade have evaporated as well. Movie Information The Back-up PlanRatingShowtimes | Official site and trailerDirector Alan PoulActors Jennifer Lopez Alex OLoughlin Anthony Anderson Michaela Watkins Linda Lavin and Tom BosleyRun time 106 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (language sexual content)Synopsis Jennifer Lopez gets artificially inseminated - just before she meets Mr. Right (Alex OLoughlin).More movies from GuideLive.comEnter The Back-Up Plan which plays a bit like a chick-flick version of Knocked Up. Instead of bong hits we have lucky pennies; a daffy single-mother support group has replaced the babbling stoners gallery. But the complications of a mismatched couple and parenthood anxieties remain even if the laughs disappear for long stretches.Lopez plays Zoe a New York woman who owns a pet store and wants a baby but for reasons left hazy not a partner. Returning from an appointment with her OB-GYN (ladies and gentlemen Robert Klein) she meets cute with a hunky urban cheese farmer named Stan (Alex OLoughlin) and before you can say ""jalapeno Jack"" shes staying out at his farm where she delivers one of the funniest orgasm scenes since Harry met Sally.Its no big surprise that Lopez can still get laughs; she has a relaxed way with the camera that has mellowed and ripened over the years. She can do comedy. But The Back-Up Plan is too soft and gooey for her or OLoughlin who fares well as a sort of Jon Stewart type to leave much of a lasting impression. The movie telegraphs nearly every move which might not be a negative for its core audience Formulas provide comfort and comfort more than ever keeps the romantic comedy treadmill moving.So yes just as Zoe finally meets the man of her dreams she must tell him shes pregnant with a strangers baby. They get the baby books. He gets cold feet. She complains about her expanding rear end a not-so-inside joke for aficionados of the Lopez figure. They bicker make up bicker again make up again. Will they make it? What do you think? It would be so uncomfortable if they didnt.Some of the funniest moments come courtesy of Anthony Anderson as a playground dad who schools Stan on what to expect from fatherhood. Not quite as winning the shrews and eccentrics who provide cheap chuckles in Zoes single-mom group. Portrayed as a collection of chanting loopy outcasts they stack the deck in favor of matrimony and create the unfortunate (and misguided) suggestion that single mothers must be out of their minds. Zoe girl what were you thinking? You can get the guy and have a lifetime supply of cheese all in one fell swoop. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Starring Jennifer Lopez Alex OLoughlin Eric Christian Olsen Noureen DeWulf Donal Logue Melissa McCarthy Harold Gould Jennifer Elise Cox Linda Lavin Michaela Watkins Director Alan Poul Release Opened Apr 23 2010  Editorial Review Aww cmon J-Lo deserves a little loveBy Dan KoisFriday April 23 2010Never let it be said that Jennifer Lopez doesnt give her all. The singer dancer actress and perfume magnate has always pursued stardom with shameless abandon and one of the pleasures of her new movie is watching J-Lo abase herself in the service of her art.In ""The Back-Up Plan"" a not-as-bad-as-you-think-it-is romantic comedy directed by Alan Poul Lopez pries a used pregnancy test out of a dogs mouth picks pieces of fried chicken out of her hair and has an epiphany in a dumpster. Most unthinkably by Hollywoods standards she endures the suggestion that she might be nearing menopause.She isnt of course (If she were she wouldnt be starring in a romantic comedy She would be playing someones wacky grandma.) Instead she plays pregnant Zoe a pet-shop owner knocked up by her OB-GYN and a baster full of donor sperm.""This isnt about a guy"" she declares early in the movie asserting her pride in choosing single motherhood -- but of course its a movie so it is about a guy Stan played by Alex OLoughlin. Zoe and Stan meet in a cab on the Upper West Side and soon begin to fall for each other. But Zoe whod just given up the search for Mr. Right has to decide whether to stick to her back-up plan -- single motherhood and career -- or take a chance on telling her new beau exactly why it is shes glowing.Its a tough choice. Not only is Stan sexy and sensitive but he -- be still my dairy-loving heart -- makes cheese. On his organic goat farm. (By the time Stan and Zoe kissed in a candle-lit cave full of ripening chevres even my mouth was watering. Although that may have been the chevres.)But television vet Kate Angelos screenplay cant imagine any interaction between Zoe and Stan other than stressed-out fighting and blissed-out reconciliation.If the movie is a little dumb about romance though its surprisingly smart about the perils of 21st-century parenthood. Unlike the previous generation of moms and dads who gave their lives over to their children with good cheer -- or at least stoicism -- contemporary parents default setting is that of rueful complaint. Zoes best friend Mona (Michaela Watkins) is a hard-drinking mother of three who advises Zoe against child-rearing as her children run screaming through the apartment. Meanwhile nervous Stan receives dismaying advice from a father played by Anthony Anderson at a Central Park playground. (In a moment that any parent will recognize the dad seeing childless Stan outside the fence first assumes hes a pervert.) ""Being a dad is awful and then awful awful awful awful and then amazing and then awful again"" Anderson says just before his son brings him a surprise from the sandbox.And the movies best comedic set piece -- a home birth by a member of Zoes mothering support group -- does little to advance its romantic story line but did provoke wild whoops of recognition from the audience at its vision of childbirth as one part magic 20 parts nightmarish chamber of horrors. ""The Back-Up Plans"" blunt honesty about the messiness of pregnancy is refreshing. Its a shame that the movie couldnt find a similarly refreshing way to tell its uninspired love story.But dont blame J-Lo Shes working so hard that youll see her sweat (and pee and vomit and bleed and belch). Her fierce commitment to an uneven script is touching and while you wont find proof that she has become 13 years into her movie career a natural actress its not hard to like her. And despite a saggy middle and a soggy ending its not so hard to like ""The Back-Up Plan"" either.

Photo (c)CBS/Courtesy Everett Collection In ""The Back-Up Plan"" a woman named Zoe (Jennifer Lopez) meets the love of her life the same day shes been artificially inseminated (dont you hate it when that happens?). Zoe and Stan (Alex OLoughlin) squabble over a cab in the rain but its instantly clear these two lookers are meant for each other. They are both models of political correctness Zoe having given up a corporate job to run a pet shop called Hudson Mutts that does not do business with puppy mills. She shares her apartment with a disabled puppy named Nuts. Stan is a sustainable farmer who runs a cheese stand at a farmers market in TriBeCa which the filmmakers (all TV veterans) hilariously seem to think stretches as far east as Avenue B. POPWRAP CHATS WITH ALEX OLOUGHLIN PHOTOS THE BACK-UP PLAN FILMING IN NEW YORK MORE BRIDAL BUMP It isnt till Zoe visits the frequently shirtless Stan at his farm upstate that she breaks her Big News (pregnant on the first try) which she has learned after wrestling a test stick out of Nuts mouth. ""Im going through some changes"" Zoe explains to Alex. ""Menopause?"" Alex asks. ""Menopause? How old do you think I am?"" Zoe responds. (For the record the actress playing her is 40.) This triggers the first of two breakups that we know cant last -- as if any character played by Jennifer Lopez would have trouble finding a husband in the first place. The movie packs in plenty of wisecracking sidekicks for Zoe including Michaela Watkins Noureen DeWulf and Eric Christan Olsen. Linda Lavin turns up to play her grandmother Tom Bosley plays Grandmas 92-year-old fiance and Robert Klein completes the senior contingent as Zoes fertility specialist. No possible demographic is ignored in this CBS Films production which includes lesbians in Zoes single-mother support group a black father (Anthony Anderson) coping with his sons poop in a playground that Alex inexplicably visits -- and even a cameo by Dog Whisperer Cesar Millan. OLoughin who appeared in the regrettable schmalzfest ""August Rush"" between flop TV series serves a mostly decorative role. Theres even a scene in which Zoe is chewing on a muffin when she spies her stud muffin for the second time. Lopez appearing in her first rom-com since ""Monster-in-Law"" five years ago is still a likable screen presence who throws herself into the movies slapstick sequences with unwarranted enthusiasm. One character observes ""In a years time this is just going to be a funny memory."" Actually in a years time the fluffy ""The Back-Up Plan"" will find its rightful venue Showtime. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Bridal bump Read Next Bridal bump Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46924 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 19318 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 18679 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"The Back-up Plan Jennifer Lopez delivers but its labourious | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Back-up Plan Jennifer Lopez delivers but its labouriousThe excruciating hours of labour and delivery fade with the joy of new life. But the dull pain of Jennifer Lopezs cutie-pie pregnancy rom-com The Back-up Plan makes us sufferJennifer Lopez does fine as a comic actor in an otherwise labourious pregnancy rom-com but her characters bug-eyed dog steals every scene hes in.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. April 22 2010The Back-up Plan(out of 4)Starring Jennifer Lopez Alex OLoughlin Michaela Watkins and Robert Kline. Directed by Alan Poul. 99 minutes. At major theatres. PGThe excruciating hours of labour and delivery fade with the joy of new life. But the dull pain of cutie-pie pregnancy rom-com The Back-up Plan makes us suffer needlessly.Formulaic and often crude (who says guy flicks should get all the gross scenes?) The Back-up Plan marks the return of Jennifer Lopez to the big screen after an extended maternity leave. It shows us Jenny from the Block is still flawlessly beautiful while proving the theory that Hollywood is working on its last and only idea in the romantic-comedy genre.Article Continued BelowIts not to say Lopez isnt skilled as a laugh-getter. She gamely throws herself into a variety of situations and does often-pleasing physical schtick with enthusiasm although not always with success. (The fakest orgasm in the history of fakes will conjure new admiration for Meg Ryans skills.)Lopez plays Zoe a pet store owner who has decided to go it alone on the road to parenthood in the absence of meeting Mr. Right -- her back-up plan to replace marriage/baby carriage Plan A. Turns out Mr. Right isnt absent hes just running late. Zoe meets him in the old ""thats my cab"" trope on a rainy Manhattan street on the day shes inseminated at her doctors office which tells us all we need to know about where the movie is going. But its how it beats this dead horse in order to eke out a 99-minute movie is where the discomfort begins.Do we really need to see a grinning gynecologist (Robert Klein) show us a blood-smeared glove after removing it from Zoes nethers? Just in case you didnt get it the first time look Heres a bloody sonogram wand. The single mothers group has some amusing bits but relies on the old chestnuts about men being useless lugheads amid drum-beating sisterhood-power affirmations and graphic predictions about what birth does to ones lady bits. A very long scene involving a woman giving birth at home in a wading pool while making Exorcist sounds just goes too far and shows way too much. On the upside Zoes disabled bug-eyed dog-in-a-wheelie cart steals every scene hes in.Aussie actor Alex OLoughlin has the thankless task of playing second banana to Zoe morphing from selfish cab grabber to caring and nurturing partner-to-be in a New York minute. Trouble is hes not terribly engaging in either role. His next gig is starring in the TV reboot of Hawaii Five-O which appears a better fit.As Stan hes a farmer who peddles his goat cheese at an outdoor city market (you know hes sweet on Zoe because he names a cheese after her) with a tendency to doff his shirt showing off an extraordinarily buff physique. A dairy farmer who looks like he never touches dairy -- if there was ever any doubt that The Back-Up Plan is a chick flick this puts an end to it. Director Alan Poul (Six Feet Under Big Love) gets his first feature-film credit with The Back-up Plan and provides some romantic eye candy with candle-lit scenes while wisely keeping his camera trained on J.Lo as much as possible. Toronto music fans will cheerily bop along to the k-os hit ""Crabbuckit"" which plays as heavily pregnant Zoe tries various techniques to haul herself into a cab while boomers will feel ancient when they see the obvious miles on 70s TV stars Linda Lavin (Alice) and Tom Bosley (Happy Days). But console yourselves with a long look at dewy La Lopez who at 40 looks more radiant than ever.

(Peter Iovino) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday April 22 2010 503 PM Title The Back-up Plan We all know that sleep deprivation leads to impaired judgment. And as the mother of twin toddlers Jennifer Lopez probably doesnt get much rest. So at least shes got a ready excuse when people wonder why she signed on for a project as charmless and derivative as ""The Back-up Plan.""Lopez plays Zoe the owner of a successful Manhattan pet store. Comfortably independent shes ready to have and raise a child on her own.In fact when we first meet her shes at her doctors office about to undergo artificial insemination. But -- wouldnt you know it -- she and goat farmer Stan (Alex OLoughlin) meet cute just minutes after the procedure is over.Within days theyve fallen in love and she discovers shes pregnant. He takes this news surprisingly well even when it turns out shes having twins.So over the next nine months they (and we) endure every pregnancy cliche imaginable from morning sickness and sudden cravings to scary mood swings and pre-labor panic.Theres also a wacky single-mothers group not to mention wacky best friends (Michaela Watkins Eric Christian Olsen) and a wacky grandma (Linda Lavin).Eventually of course these thrown-together lovers must be torn apart so they can reunite for a satisfying conclusion. But how satisfying is it to watch two strangers with no chemistry go through the motions? Really its more like were stuck inside the years most awkward blind date.Lopez works visibly hard to keep things light while OLoughlins flat performance suggests that hes either deeply uncomfortable or just struggling to hide his Australian accent. The supporting cast of grating sidekicks fares no better with Kate Angelos lazy script and Alan Pouls mechanical direction.The only person who might appreciate such a shoddy effort is Jennifer Aniston who has her own artificial insemination comedy ""The Switch"" coming up soon. (Yes Hollywood has officially run out of ideas.) Presumably shes better rested than Lopez and put a little more thought into her own impending delivery.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"The Back-up Planreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Back-up Planreviewed. The Back-up Planreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 22 2010 1020 PM The Back-up Plan Jennifer Lopezs new romantic comedy. By Dana Stevens Jennifer Lopez in The Back-up Plan I think I may be suffering from romantic-comedy Stockholm syndrome. After being repeatedly brutalized by the cynical soul-deadening rom-coms of recent years ( The Ugly Truth The Proposal New in Town) perhaps Ive begun to identify with my captors and am now grateful for the smallest scrap they throw me. Formulaic plot? Bland characters? Sappy ending? Fine. Just dont make me watch Katherine Heigl have a remote-controlled orgasm in a restaurant. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Back-up Plan (CBS Films) with Jennifer Lopez as a would-be single mother surprised by love is by any reasonable standard a bad movie predictably scripted sentimental with laughs that rarely rise above a gentle sitcom chuckle. But at least its not reprehensible misogynistic or cynical and the lead couple isnt made up of a shrill female narcissist and a proudly slovenly male lug. I wouldnt go so far as to recommend this movie but if you were tied down and forced to watch it you wouldnt necessarily have to chew off your own leg to get away. (If All About Steve comes on in similar circumstances start gnawing.) Advertisement Theres something irreducibly menschy about Jennifer Lopez if a Latina can be menschy. For all I know Lopez may be an insufferable diva in real life but onscreen she comes across as earthy warm and likeable. Shes never lived up to the acting promise she showed in Out of Sight which may turn out to be both her and Steven Soderberghs finest hour but Lopez has a grounded self-confident almost tomboyish quality that many current rom-com heroines lack. Unlike Renee Zellweger Jennifer Garner Kate Hudson et al. she doesnt come across as desperate to be adored. (Sandra Bullock shares this grounded quality which may explain why her appeal has survived so many terrible movies.) Lopez inherent charm comes in handy in lending some personality to the otherwise anodyne Zoe a New Yorker in her late 30s whos just chosen to become a single mother via artificial insemination. We first meet Zoe splayed in stirrups while a gynecologist (played inexplicably by the 70s standup comedian Robert Klein) inseminates her with donated sperm. On her way out of the clinic Zoe hails a taxi at the exact same time as a handsome young man named Stan (Alex OLoughlin) and they fight over who has the right to use the cab. (If this ever happens to you just marry the guy immediately and save us all some headaches.) Both Stan and Zoe have romantic-comedy-ready jobs Hes an organic goat farmer who runs a cheese stand at the farmers market; shes in charge of a Manhattan pet store. (The animal theme continues with Zoes paraplegic Boston terrier who scoots around on a little cart and gets more cutaway reaction shots than Barbara Walters during an interview.) After their initial meet-cute in the cab Stan and Zoe quickly fall in love but on the night of their first date she learns that the insemination worked--shes pregnant with a strangers child. After the shock wears off Stan is game but when a sonogram reveals shes carrying twins he starts to freak out again. As Stan the Australian OLoughlin doesnt melt the screen with his charisma but hes not a Ken doll either--in the right vehicle he could be a funny hunk in the Ryan Reynolds mode. All this makes for some pretty low-stakes drama. But I will admit that I liked the fact that the only obstacles this movie throws in the couples path to happiness spring from their own neuroses. Rather than coming up with elaborate plot contrivances to keep Zoe and Stan apart the scriptwriter Kate Angelo (Will amp; Grace) shows how small things--like Stans infelicitous word choice when he tells an ex-girlfriend that the babies-to-be ""arent mine""--can blow up into dealbreakers. Angelos not a master of witty repartee and neither Zoe nor Stan seems like the sharpest knife in the drawer but we believe they care about each other. Advertisement This PG-13 movie attempts a few ventures into R-rated territory at its own peril. A scene in which a woman from Zoes single-mothers group forces the couple to attend her ultra-crunchy home birth is genuinely terrifying--like Zoe and Stan the audience can only stare in horror at the gruesome spectacle--but completely unfunny. The closest we get to nudity is a quick shot of Zoe examining her rear end in a mirror--I believe its bare but she may have been wearing a thong--while moaning about the (demonstrably untrue) fact that pregnancy has ruined her body. Of course the real-life Jennifer Lopez has one of the best-known asses in show business and has also like her character given birth to twins. This moment could be read two ways Lopez either is making a self-deprecating joke about her celebrated tush or is proving to her fans that protestations aside its still looking good. The Back-Up Plan is the second film from CBS Films the new movie-making arm of the television behemoth. Their first release Extraordinary Measures had a similar feeling to this one comfortable and formulaic movie-of-the-weekish but not without its own unambitious charm. Even the supporting cast comes from the ranks of TV sitcom royalty with Alices Linda Lavin as Zoes grandmother and Happy Days Tom Bosley as the grandmothers fiance. It now seems clear that CBS Films releases will hark back to the heyday of broadcast television sweet-natured retrograde entertainments that demand of their audience only that it not demand too much of them.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 23 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Back-up Plan Directed by Alan Poul Written by Kate Angelo Starring Jennifer Lopez and Alex OLoughlin Classification PG After a four-year hiatus and having given birth to twins herself Jennifer Lopez who is now 40 makes her return to the movies in The Back-up Plan a blend of a traditional rom-com and pregnancy comedy. The twist here is that the pregnancy comes first as J.Lo playing an unmarried Manhattan pet-shop owner named Zoe opts for the ""back-up plan"" of going it alone and getting pregnant through artificial insemination. Wouldnt you know it? On the very day she gets injected with a shot of sperm she meets a cute guy Stan (Australian actor Alex OLoughlin) when they both dive for the same taxi cab in the rain. Stans a pushy but personable farmer and cheese-maker who she runs into again at the local market. Love blooms before Zoe discovers shes pregnant with twins and she cant figure out how to break the news to Stan. Surging with hormones - especially after seeing him shirtless on his tractor - shes more full of lust than candour. Trouble is Stan is the sensitive sort having been betrayed by his first wife a hyper-sexual Swede who left him feeling bitter toward all women (rather than more logically just hypersexual Swedes). Though the premise feels forced you might hope script-writer Kate Angelo ( Will amp; Grace) could turn this into some decent comic fodder. Making cheese after all sounds like a funny way to make a living. Whats more J.Lo - who has probably done more for curves than anyone since the inventor of differential calculus - fretting about getting a big derriere is almost amusing. Mostly though The Back-up Plan feels like a movie aimed right at the funny bones of four-year-olds. At one point Zoe actually calls her beau a ""stupid head."" Robert Klein as Zoes obstetrician senses Stans discomfort with feminine anatomy by yelling ""Vagina vagina vagina vagina vagina."" Theres messy eating an encounter with ""poo-poo."" When laughs run dry the camera cuts to Zoes disabled Boston terrier Nuts who needs a cart to support its back legs. As director Alan Poul ( Six Feet Under) said in a press interview ""Hes one of the go-to characters for funny."" Between Zoe and Stans recurrent spats and reconciliations there are more than a dozen supporting characters used to cover the lack of any real dramatic conflict. Anthony Anderson appears as a playground dad to tell Stan stories about the horrors and joys of fatherhood. Seventies sitcom stars Linda Lavin (as Zoes mom) and Tom Bosley (as Zoes moms boyfriend) appear in a handful of scenes. Then there are Zoes two pet-shop employees (Eric Christian Olsen as the slacker dude and Noureen DeWulf as the sarcastic sidekick). Zoe also has an acerbic best friend Mona (Michaela Watkins) to give romantic advice and finally theres Zoes single-mothers group a gaggle of preciously New Age-y types who beat drums and chant and talk about having children without a ""penis partner."" The mothers group provides the context for the films physical comedy set piece a loud and chaotic home-birthing scene (aired during the Superbowl as a preview for the film) which treats giving birth as slightly more disgusting than a horror-movie exorcism. In the midst of The Back-up Plans overall fluffiness theres a recurrent message that pregnant women with their voracious appetites and cumbersome bodies are gross and icky. For a farmer Stan is unaccountably squeamish around these natural processes but then one has a sense that OLoughlins real job here is to find every opportunity to take his shirt off for viewers to ogle. As for Lopez this is another of her everyday superwoman roles Zoes a former global Internet executive with her own Greenwich Village shop fashionable clothes and supportive friends who succeeds in accessorizing her perfect lifestyle with a family.

Los Mom-Rom-Com Bomb By Mary Pols Thursday Apr. 22 2010 Share Tweet Read Later Send to Kindle Peter Iovino / CBS Films / APJennifer Lopez in a scene from The Back-Up Plan. Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME My pregnancy lasted 41 weeks and five days involved morning afternoon and night sickness and culminated in 25 hours of labor capped off by an emergency C-section. Yet all that seems like a walk in the park compared with the 100 minutes I spent watching Jennifer Lopez mug her way through The Back-Up Plan a romantic comedy about single motherhood -- or mom-rom-com -- that manages to be both bland and offensive. (See Earth Day photos of the earth from above.) Lopez plays Zoe a pet-store owner whom we are introduced to on the morning she is being artificially inseminated. Zoe plans to be a single mother but there are signs tipping us off to the unlikelihood of that becoming reality. For one thing she lives in New York City where the vast majority of sad cinematic single women are delivered from their tragic manless state by the time the credits roll. For another her girlish concern that her doctor (the amusing Robert Klein) will be offended by her lack of a fresh pedicure or a waxing suggests shes not exactly a radical freethinker. (See the best and worst moms ever.) As she leaves the doctors office the only question is how long it will take for a man to -- wait theres one trying to steal her cab His name is Stan (Alex OLoughlin) and while hes obnoxious and weirdly aggressive he does in his favor have two legs two arms and a full head of hair. Plus hes an artisanal cheesemaker the 2010 version of a sexy carpenter. With the arrival of this walking fantasy of manhood presumably Zoe can put aside her nonsensical plan to become a mother on her own. But screenwriter Kate Angelo (who wrote for TVs Will amp; Grace and What About Brian) is not done ridiculing the very notion that a woman like Zoe pretty and with financial means might willingly become a single mother. Despite having a man in her sights Zoe joins a group called Single Mothers and Proud where she is the only rose without obvious thorns. The group includes a rotund earth mother named Carol (Melissa McCarthy) a strident man hater (Maribeth Monroe) and a woman still nursing what appears to be a kindergartner. None of them want to hear Zoes angst over meeting her dream man on the day she got pregnant in a doctors office and who could blame them? These glowering stereotypes might make you chuckle a few times -- militant-single-mothers groups do exist and perhaps Angelo visited one as research -- but there is something truly poisonous in the way they are trotted out as representations of the last thing any attractive successful woman would want to be. Certainly its hard to imagine Lopez joining their earthy ranks. The actress who charmed in The Wedding Planner and held her own with George Clooney in Out of Sight seems to have forgotten everything she ever knew about acting. The best that can be said about her is that shes game for some mortifying on-screen moments. But whether Zoe is having a pelvic exam or a spontaneous screaming orgasm brought on by kissing (supposedly generated by pregnancy hormones but were dubious) Lopez always looks more like shes posing for In Style than embodying a real woman. The way Zoe simpers with Stan is unbearable; shes either giving us a little moue or playfully hooking a finger between her teeth like a coquette from silent-screen days. You want her wry best friend Mona (played winningly by Michaela Watkins) to tell her to stop voguing. As for OLoughlin he struggles limply with a character who is supposed to be wildly romantic -- Stan names a new ""sassy and complex"" goat cheese after Zoe -- but also legitimately conflicted about the odd situation hes landed in. They barely know each other and his resentment of Zoes emotional and physical disappearance into the throes of pregnancy isnt tempered by a biological fathers excitement at meeting his offspring. So Stan whines. When he tosses her pregnancy pillow out the window because shes become more reliant on it than on him he does not appear to be a man of anyones dreams. The movie though is too traditional in mind-set not to make him a keeper rather than letting Zoe descend into the horror of water births surrounded by drum-beating womyn. Ultimately the message of The Back-Up Plan seems to be Dont have one -- because you never know when a semiprize like Stan might come along. (Stan would likely win the endorsement of Lori Gottlieb the single mother whose authorship of Marry Him The Case for Settling for Mr. Good Enough suggests she regrets her choice.) This summer Jennifer Aniston will star in another mom-rom-com The Switch about a single woman whose male best friend secretly swaps his own product for her sperm-bank purchase. Its hard not to see that one ending in wedding bells too. You know what would be really contemporary? A movie about a woman who goes to a sperm bank and returns home with a baby -- not a mate.

"Back-up Plan is impregnated with rom-com cliches - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Back-up Plan is impregnated with rom-com cliches Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Peter Iovino CBS Films A cheesy moment Zoe (Jennifer Lopez) meets and falls for farmer Stan (Alex OLoughlin) after she gets artificially inseminated. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Back-up Plan  (out of four)Stars Jennifer Lopez Alex OLoughlin Michaela Watkins Linda Lavin Tom BosleyDirector Alan PoulDistributor CBS FilmsRating PG-13 for sexual content and some crude material Running time 1 hour 42 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Back-up Plan follows the romantic-comedy playbook to the letter. A couple meets cute when both jump into the same taxi. She initially resists he woos her with heart-melting overtures. They share a tender kiss a few laughs and great sex settling into happy domesticity. Then he makes a blunder that tears them apart. She learns of a sweet gesture he made but it might be too late. VIDEO Watch the trailer INTERVIEW Lopez is back after a long break ON-SCREEN DATES Guys like OLoughlin growing into big stars This particular romance also involves pregnancy though not achieved in the usual fashion. Jennifer Lopez plays Zoe a thirtysomething pet-store owner who has given up on meeting Mr. Right and wants a baby. She undergoes artificial insemination an experience that goes swimmingly. But then she meets Stan the cheese farmer played by Alex OLoughlin. Hes no stinky overall-wearing hick. This is a sophisticated New York guy with the spectacular pecs of a Calvin Klein model. He sells his goat cheese at a neighborhood farmers market and dreams of opening a shop that sells only local cheeses. In other words hes a picture-perfect man. Zoe is also a catch. Besides being beautiful shes a former corporate honcho who now hosts book signings by dog whisperer Cesar Millan. She owns an adorable disabled Boston bull terrier that skitters around her well-appointed apartment in a little cart. When director Alan Poul cant come up with a clever scenario (which is often) he simply cuts away to the bug-eyed pooch. The dog knows his cues A cocked head or a tentative growl elicit audience giggles. The story resorts frequently to bathroom humor and birth-related gross-out gags courtesy of a support group of stock weird characters. A mother nurses a child old enough to speak in full sentences. A tattooed single mom delivers a baby in a wading pool emitting barnyard sounds. We see a lot of the physique that Lopez has always displayed proudly. And she does project some charm and is more adept at physical comedy than in previous movies. OLoughlin is primarily a foil used to amplify Lopezs adorability quotient. But when it comes to comedies about pregnancy Knocked Up and Baby Mama delivered more. This sitcom style exercise in planned parenthood is blandly predictable. If it were a cheese it would be Velveeta. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Wouldnt you know it the moment after she gets pregnant -- with twins no less -- she meets the right guy. His name is Stan hes played by the Australian-born American-TV hottie Alex OLoughlin (who looks like a less squinty version of the young Jason Lee) and hes an upstate dairy farmer who sells his delectable goat cheeses at her local farmers market. For a moment or two in the culture becoming a single mother seemed a hip thing to do especially if you were a celebrity. But the current economic climate only highlights the challenges for women who decide to have kids on their own. The Back-up Plan is a romantic comedy caught between those two visions of single motherhood. Since Zoe is played by J. Lo shes radiant and silky beaming with personal power. Its no wonder that the moment she meets Stan shes thrilled and freaked at the same time If she really falls for him what on earth is she going to do with all that regal self-possession? Even as the movie casting about for a romantic obstacle proceeds to satirize Stans anxieties about fatherhood (the responsibility the preschool tuition) it seems to tiptoe around the real issue -- that Zoe now in love would probably say that getting pregnant on her own was not a good idea. As a romantic comedy The Back-up Plan is friendly but also a bit drab. Its true subject isnt love so much as the comedy of pregnancy. There are some very broad jokes about cravings morning sickness and hormones run amok. Zoe joins a support group for single mothers and theyre played fairly broadly too (as New Age neurotics) though the movie does feature a home-birth sequence thats a funny up-to-the-minute explosion of feminine energy. A prediction That sequence is going to sell the movie. At least more than the central situation does. Were supposed to believe that Zoe keeps pushing Stan away because shes scared of depending on any man. But really with this nice-guy hunk around cautiously imploring her to let him be the father of her children would she really want to raise those twins on her own? Too often The Back-up Plan makes even the prospect of having it all look like something to complain about. B- Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Lo has a ""Back-up Plan"" Babies make four in this agreeable romantic comedy.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune April 22 2010 -- 237pm CBS Films Dml - Jennifer Lopez and Alex OLoughlin in ""The Back-up Plan."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a baby. After their shoe frenzy has been satisfied bachelorettes turn into heat-seeking infant hunters. Thats the premise of the artificial-insemination comedy ""The Back-up Plan"" or as it was probably pitched ""Knocked Up for Girls."" The film isnt exactly a groundbreaking work of entertainment but it passes the time engagingly. In this case the pregnancy is planned not the upshot of a boozy one-night stand with a tubby slacker. Jennifer Lopez plays Zoe a New York City pet-shop owner who decides to make a baby on her own (without ""a penis partner"" as Kate Angelos wisecracky script puts it). Zoe is inseminated in her doctors office and that very day meets Stan the most attractive man on Planet Earth (Australian actor Alex OLoughlin who boasts a Tarzan physique and crack comic instincts). She has reasons to be skeptical about men he has reasons to mistrust women and their courtship is complicated by Zoes little secret. Her hot buns in the oven (its twins) turn her into a hormonally fired-up sex volcano one moment and a puke-spewing ball of queasiness the next. Dames. OLoughlin is agreeable as Stan. He can be romantically expansive and uptight. When he gets nervous at the F-word -- future -- hes visibly torn. For once the commitment-shy dude has a darned good reason. And Lopez is so funny glowingly warm and awkwardly sexy as the hugely pregnant unwed lady you wonder what shes doing in a trifling movie like this. The cheeseball opening credits are the animated equivalent of those chick-lit book covers incorporating a martini glass and a pair of high heels. I wanted to check out before the film began. And the production values are barely midrange. Apparently Lopez is declining in star magnetism at the very time shes improving as a comic actress. Indifferently directed by Alan Poul ""The Back-up Plan"" is not a blessed event but its not bad. The films comic misfires -- octogenarians in a conga line pushy ""fun"" musical cues way too much falling down -- are balanced by its surprisingly jaundiced view of parenthood. The members of Zoes single-moms-by-choice support group are wickedly caricatured flakes hippie types and man-haters -- they look like they wandered out of a Charles Addams cartoon. Stan gets the lowdown on the joys and oys of fatherhood (mostly oys) from a frazzled playground dad (Anthony Anderson). As the pregnancy progresses Lopez shovels chili into her gob like a competitive eater and makes fun of her famously ginormous booty. Reeling from the realization of what it costs to raise a child in Manhattan Stan goes catatonic with worry. Then theres a water birth scene like something from ""The Exorcist."" And theyre still just dating. That the absurdly good-looking leads will eventually discover that they are made for each other is a given from their first cute encounter. What gives ""The Back-up Plan"" its interest is screenwriter Angelos willingness to veer from safe rom-com giggles to sloppy uncomfortable Sarah Silverman-style bad taste. This is certainly the first courtship comedy in which the stars bond while watching aghast as someone takes a dump in a kiddie pool. THE BACK-UP PLAN  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sexual content including references some crude material and language.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + In another universe -- or least another era -- ""The Back-up Plan might have been an interesting comedy. A single woman decides as a not insignificant number of single women do to cease man-hunting and conceive a child on her own. Not long after the insemination -- OK the minute its over -- she meets a perfectly reasonable candidate for a partner. He really likes her but how OK is he with the baby thing? Let the soul searching and social commentary begin. Just kidding.""The Back-up Plan directed by Alan Poul is a romantic comedy starring Jennifer Lopez. So it cant be interesting at all. It contains enough metaphors for both its opinion of us and its own quality that a reviewer is barely necessary. The animated opening credits feature a man and woman whose wine glasses upon clinking together turn into baby bottles that each proceeds to suck. Lopezs crippled dog vomits up the results of her pregnancy test. And her perfect -- perfectly bland -- mate Stan (Alex OLoughlin) makes cheese for a living. Meanwhile the less said the better regarding a scene that requires Lopez to root around in a dumpster for a pillow.Zoe (Lopez) and Stan meet when they wind up hopping into the same Manhattan cab at the same time. That he couldnt have seen her opening the door first calls to mind an old pickup move feigning serendipity. But Stan cant be that conniving. Hes a locavore for heavens sake. Zoe meanwhile ""used to work in the corporate world. Now she runs a pet store. This of course is a problem with ""The Back-up Plan. Cuteness is viral. That crippled dog gets as many close-ups as Lopez.This is a movie where characters drink giant cups of coffee on an elliptical machine where Stans shirtless tractor-driving causes car accidents where apartment doors are sitcom-ishly unlocked where spilled wine interrupts a kiss then somehow starts a fire that ends in a water fight.That an upscale Latina New Yorker would be compelled to take this route to starting a family is another interesting idea whose conflicts the movie avoids altogether. Kate Angelos screenplay has killed the characters mother and sent her father off to who knows where. Its just Zoe that dog and her nana (Linda Lavin). Her best friends family is a commercial for a migraine reliever. Stans only pals include an ex-girlfriend who sells her muffins next to his cheese stall and Anthony Anderson as a dad he meets at a playground.Whats so disappointing about movies like ""The Back-up Plan -- which is to say every romantic comedy thats opened in the last two years -- is that theyre risk averse. The fantasy aspects of this one skew much closer to so-called chick lit where expensive shoes never touch the earth. No one says anything true or offensive or funny. Real life is always horrific. Here the camera manages to turn a scene of home birth into a version of the ""Rosemarys Baby finale. Come to think of it ""Rosemarys Baby Daddy would have been a better title.But ""The Back-up Plan is a title apt for a dancer who acts and sings but excels at neither. Lopez smiles whines and blinks her way through this movie. She seems more relaxed than she ever has. And yet it seems like shes hiding in romantic comedies lest we discover that she doesnt have a ""Monsters Ball or even a ""Blind Side in her. What if Lopez actually has no stops to pull out?She needs the challenge of a compelling costar. George Clooney as is his wont made her seem vital in ""Out of Sight. That was a dozen years ago and sadly Alex OLoughlin is no George Clooney. Hes an Australian who can speak in a convincing regional American accent and look good topless. This movie is really about Stans dilemma. But OLoughlins job is to offer selfless support. Hes not performing a character. Hes playing a shelf.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Now its ""First comes sperm then comes baby will new b.f. sign on as Daddy? Maybe.""The Back-up Plan a pleasant and instantly forgettable rom-com starring Jennifer Lopez is an effect of the new procreative order that inverts the sequence of courtship and kids. Rather than baby as product of loving couple loving couple is product of baby.The film from scriptwriter Kate Angelo(Will amp; Grace) and director Alan Poul (Six Feet Under) has a shiny look and a breezy feel - the breeze being generated by the plot reversals that come at 10-minute intervals.From the opening scene an insemination sequence where Zoe (Lopez) looks at her chipped toenails in the stirrups and worries about her pedicure the film focuses on the frivolous as a way of not engaging the serious.Like many women of a certain age Zoe (Lopez glowing like a jar of honey in the sun) has so had it with sex without procreation that now shes trying procreation without sex. (She mistrusts men because it is revealed her father was a bolter.)Zoe is the proprietor of an upscale Tribeca pet store (and owner of a disabled Boston terrier that gets more screen time than Eddie the Jack Russell on Frasier).After leaving her gynecologist Zoe runs smack into Stan (Australian actor Alex OLoughlin) a cheese maker when he jumps in the same cab as she does.The remainder of this up-and-down film closely tracks Stans roller-coaster ride to the heights of new love and the sudden plunging depths of anxiety about insta-fatherhood.On the minus side The Back-up Plan is cutesy and formulaic and has the approximate depth of a cookie sheet.On the plus Its leads are easy on the eyes Lopez wears great clothes and there are a few cheap laughs.These giggles are prompted by the films satirical take on a single-mom support group. It is led by an earnest facilitator and populated by earth mothers yummy mummies and the type of nurturer who defines her job as nursing her baby at least through high school graduation.Lopez does not so much give a performance as cheerfully endure multiple wardrobe malfunctions including bursting the seam of a dress getting hosed down while wearing a sequined chiffon frock and having her water break while wearing a bridesmaids number.The Back-up Plan requires no heavy lifting mental or otherwise.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215 854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Its been four years since Jennifer Lopez starred in a movie and even longer since she appeared in a movie anyone saw 2005s abhorrent Monster-In-Law. Lopez still looks fantastic but shes aged out of the ingenue and single-gal-on-the-go roles that littered her early filmography. In Monster-In-Law Lopez played a spunky dog-walker with big dreams. Returning to the big screen in the feverishly non-anticipated comeback vehicle The Back-Up Plan shes graduated to owning a successful pet store. Yet in spite of her professional success Lopez remains unfulfilled in her personal life. Despairing of ever finding the right man and keenly attuned to the relentless ticking of her biological clock Lopez gives artificial insemination a try only to discover the man of her dreams (Alex OLoughlin) at exactly the same time. When he learns shes carrying twins whose biological father shell probably never meet OLoughlin begins to wonder whether hes emotionally prepared for the challenges of parenthood. The Back-Up Plan begins like a typical frilly superficial Lopez vehicle. Shes got a cute job a cute wardrobe cute employees and a cute disabled dog plus she meets cute with a cute guy when they hop into the same cab. At a certain point however The Back-Up Plan stops even trying to be funny and wrestles with the challenges facing a couple that skipped straight from the honeymoon stage of their relationship to the raising-children-together stage without hitting many stops between. Yet the films admirable attempt to move into deeper waters and explore the stresses and joys of a unique instant family proves an awkward fit with cutesy comic touches like wacky dog-reaction shots spit-takes and multiple instances of comic fainting. The Back-Up Plan is a film divided against itself. Its really two movies one silly and one serious. Too bad neither is particularly compelling.

By Christy Lemire updated 4/21/2010 43846 PM ET 2010-04-21T203846 Print Font + - REVIEW ""The Back-up Plan"" gets sitcommy early and often and just for good measure throws in old TV favorites Tom Bosley and Linda Lavin in brief roles. But regardless of their presence or that of the appealing (and frequently shirtless) Alex OLoughlin in his first leading-man role this is a vehicle for Jennifer Lopez who is front and center and looking flawless at all times. The first time we see her character Zoe shes at the doctors office with her feet in the stirrups being artificially inseminated wearing false eyelashes and perfect lip gloss. In case we couldnt possibly imagine what shes thinking the script from Kate Angelo (a former sitcom writer) offers this helpful voiceover nugget ""Oh God I hope this works.

He also cuts away to Zoes Boston terrier for cheap reaction shots so frequently it could be a drinking game -- and this comes from someone whos proud to be the human companion to one of these adorable dogs. All these devices are in service of a plot thats pretty thin. After years of looking for the right guy Zoe is prepared to have a baby on her own only to meet and fall for the hunky Stan (OLoughlin) just as shes discovered shes pregnant. Their meet-cute couldnt possibly be cuter Both hop into the same New York cab in the pouring rain. And Stan couldnt possibly be more perfect. Hes great-looking romantic goofy in a charming way has just the right amount of roguish facial scruff and he makes organic cheese at his familys farm upstate. Organic cheese people And somehow he clearly still finds time to hit the gym. Since they get together pretty early the rest of the movie consists of contrived flare-ups that threaten to keep them apart. Will Stan freak out and walk away when he finds out Zoe is expecting? How will he react when he discovers shes having twins? Will Zoe freak out and walk away from Stan because of her childhood abandonment issues? Will there be a mad dash to the hospital once her water breaks? The answers to these questions are never really in doubt. ""The Back-up Plan"" actually could have been helpful in addressing a situation in which so many women find themselves wanting to be mothers but unwilling to compromise to be with the wrong man to accomplish that goal. Instead it presents the fellow members of Zoes single mothers group as tattooed fringy freaks hell-bent on home water births and smugly breastfeeding their kids until age 3. On the other end of the spectrum is Zoes wisecracking best friend Mona (Michaela Watkins of ""Saturday Night Live"") a mother of four kids who are constantly running around and screaming. Admittedly she gets the few funny lines ""The Back-up Plan"" has to offer. Lavin (as Zoes Nana) and Bosley (as Nanas longtime nursing-home fiance) just look embarrassed in their few scenes. The one moment that rings true? When Stan goes stroller shopping at Babies R Us and finds himself overwhelmed. And the store clerk just happens to be the actress who played Jan Brady in the ""Brady Bunch"" movies. Copyright 2010 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The two leads are appealing but screenwriter Kate Angelo and director Alan Poul both TV veterans roll out the stalest gags imaginable (dog reaction shots pregnancy gross-outs that cause OLaughlin to keel over).

The Back-up Plan Movie Review (2001) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-back-up-plan-2001,200,theback-upplan25,theback-upplan,rogerebert
"Back-Up Plan The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; back-up-plan-the ) Back-Up Plan The (United States 2010) April 21 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Film critics love titles that imply something about the movie in question (either in a straightforward or ironic fashion). Thus it might seem that The Back-Up Plan offers a perfect opportunity to play with the name; after all as it applies to a multiplex trip a ""back-up plan"" refers to what movie-goers see when their first choice is sold-out. Unfortunately such as assessment would be overly optimistic in this case since this movie is less a back-up plan than it is a last resort. Or to put it another way this is the film to watch when pretty much everything else has been sold out and the only remaining choices are The Back-Up Plan and the latest Rob Schneider opus. The Back-Up Plan is soft and squishy - the kind of thing that would be comfortably at home on post-Prime Time cable or as a seat-back choice on a transcontinental flight. Its dramatically vanilla suffers from sit-com humor tendencies lacks a compelling romance and struggles to find a convincing performance. Its tough to actively hate the movie because something this carefully pre-packaged is designed to deflect anger. Hollywood seems largely incapable of making an interesting funny movie about pregnancy. The only recent one that comes to mind is Knocked Up and The Back-Up Plan could easily (and effectively) be described as ""anti-Knocked Up."" It goes without saying that the PG-13 rating disallows any edgy material from entering the picture not that the filmmakers would go in that direction even if provided an R-rated opportunity. The predictable story focuses on Zoe (Jennifer Lopez) a woman in her mid-30s who despairing of ever meeting Mr. Right and settling down in familial bliss decides to go the single parent route. So armed with a test tube purchase from a local sperm bank she spends a few minutes in a fertility clinic with her feet pointed at the ceiling. A few weeks later she learns that the treatments were arguably too effective since the early ultrasound shows two beating hearts. But theres a complication. No sooner has Zoe been inseminated than she meets the elusive Mr. Right. Hes Stan (Alex OLoughlin) a hunky cheese maker who looks really good with his shirt off. Zoe worries that telling him the truth will send him looking for someone less ripe. However since this is a fairy tale Stan proves to be a stand-up kind of guy. After a little soul searching he decides to stick with Zoe through thick and thin (more of the former than the latter) and become a daddy to his girlfriends offspring. The Back-Up Plan is a hybrid romantic comedy and pregnancy comedy. There are interesting ideas in the premise but most are softened by the need to provide non-controversial mainstream fluff. Zoes pregnancy falls into the sanitized cinematic type with which we have become familiar. The combination of prosthetics and make-up used to make Lopez appear to go through the various phases of her condition is unconvincing. Moments are rare in which a shot of the actress could be considered unflattering. She looks the way most women wish they would when struggling through their third trimester. Im still trying to reconcile the downward spiral of Lopezs acting talent. In productions like Out of Sight and The Cell she lit up the screen fashioning a dynamic that was part sex appeal part force of personality and part acting capability. Since then she has slipped through the plane of mediocrity to reside in a zone where ""performance"" is synonymous with plastic smiles curvy costumes and flat dialogue. Some might argue this transformation occurred around the time she stopped being Jenny from the Block and started being J-Lo. Others might cite the Gigli factor. For me it was all about The Wedding Planner and how she airbrushed her image into something outwardly flawless but otherwise unremarkable. Her co-star in The Back-Up Plan is Alex OLoughlin a TV actor whose chief attribute is that hes photogenic enough to share scenes with Lopez and not look like a troll. For a romantic comedy to work for those who are not members of its core demographic (and will accept almost anything as long as theres an element of fantasy and wish-fulfillment) it must craft an endearing love story or consistently provoke hearty laughter. The Back-Up Plan doesnt do an especially good job at either. Its attempts at comedy which rely on a pregnancy support group comprised of stock bizarre characters and typical slapstick elements do no better than generate half-hearted chuckles. And the romance is simply uninteresting. The Back-Up Plans TV pedigree is evident - it feels like something developed for broadcast. Director Alan Poul has a substantial resume of small screen productions; this is his feature debut. Screenwriter Kate Angelo has 17 previous credits - all television. With the exception of Lopez nearly all the actors are TV fixtures including 70s icons Tom Bosley and Linda Lavin. (The appearance of the former made me a little wistful - when did Mr. Cunningham get so old?) Plus the distributor is the newly formed CBS Films the networks motion picture arm. While The Back-Up Plan might work as passable disposable fodder in the less demanding realm of non-pay television the thought of parting with 10 to see it in a multiplex auditorium is almost offensive.

The Back-Up Plan Bad Director Alan Poul. Cast Jennifer Lopez Alex OLoughlin Michaela Watkins. Rating PG-13 for sexual content including references some crude material and language. RELATED Comeback? Jennifer Lopez says she never really went away Pregnancy movies Chick flicks Spotlight Jennifer Lopez That question arises while watching ""The Back-Up Plan"" in which Jennifer Lopez stars as a single woman who becomes pregnant by artificial insemination only to meet Mr. Right the day she undergoes the procedure. Will her pregnancy scare him off? Will it accentuate her already well-honed fear of abandonment? Will the cute couple overcome both their deep-seated issues as well as the typical romantic-comedy hurdles and live happily ever after? Rhetorical questions all. You know the answers temporarily yes and come on please. Of course ""The Back-Up Plan"" actually operates from an intriguing premise and occasionally dances around some interesting issues. And its not as if every funny movie has to offer something in the way of social commentary or greater insight. Sometimes funny is just funny. Sometimes as is too often the case here its not. Zoe (Lopez) and Stan (Alex OLoughlin) ""meet cute"" as they say jumping into the same cab on a rainy day in New York. When Stan says ""That was stupid"" you wish director Alan Poul would have listened. Zoe was a successful businesswoman who bought and now runs a pet store. Stan makes cheese and hopes to open a food shop stocked with local products. After a few fits and starts the couple obviously attracted to each other finally start dating. All goes remarkably well. But Zoe has a secret. And pregnancys not like a crazy aunt or something - theres a limit to how long you can hide it. Thats particularly true with Zoe; this being a movie not only was she able to get pregnant on the first go-round of insemination shes having twins. Having to get Zoes big reveal out of the way so soon means that Poul working from a script by Kate Angelo has to fill time with other elements in addition to the now-standard formula of boy meets girl loses girl gets her back loses her again repeat. (Things are more complicated these days.) Thus we meet Zoes single-parent support group women who have decided to be parents without a ""penis partner."" (If you think thats funny tee-hee boy are you in luck.) Its led by the delightfully kooky Melissa McCarthy. Then there is Zoes grandmother (Linda Lavin) who has been engaged to her rest-home paramour (Tom Bosley) for 22 years. Finally there is Zoes dog whose hind legs are damaged so he trots around pulling a little cart. No romantic-comedy cliche goes unrecognized. Theres the cute meeting the wacky first date the adorable pet that becomes even more adorable when needed the old people doing funny things the cynical friend (Michaela Watkins seemingly channeling Susie Essmans character from ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"") the wacky birthing scene. Anything else? Probably. Anthony Anderson is funny at least as a guy Stan meets in the park who confirms all his worst fears of parenthood. Lopez is actually pretty good at this kind of thing including the slapstick bits. The affable-seeming OLoughlin masking his Australian accent looks and sounds like a lesser Jon Stewart; if they ever do a ""Daily Show"" movie heres your lead. But theyre treading woefully familiar ground with ""The Back-Up Plan"" a movie that could have used one. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Translating ""The Back-up Plan"" into formats more traditionally associated with CBS this tepid romantic comedy falls somewhere between a weak sitcom pilot and a second-tier Hallmark movie. Only the presence of Jennifer Lopez distinguishes the projects bigscreen credentials from its smallscreen elements although pics best hope of wooing a female audience is really Alex OLoughlin the swoon-inducing Aussie whom CBS has previously cast in two canceled dramas on the network side. Loosely translated into Twitter-worthy terms as romantic comedies with J-Lo go its well B-Lo par. Like many a romance with a twist this one suffers mainly from a deficiency of fleshed-out material to stretch the on-again off-again relationship much past an hour. As such director Alan Poul (CBS ""Swingtown"") and sitcom writer Kate Angelo have to keep throwing in poorly contrived flare-ups and hurdles to prolong the inevitable. The audience meets Zoe (Lopez) with her legs in stirrups in the midst of being artificially inseminated by an anonymous sperm donor. (Robert Klein does the honors joining Linda Lavin as her nana and Tom Bosley among the under-used veterans doing what little they can to augment a heavily two-character piece.) Said second character is Stan (OLoughlin) a farmer-cheesemaker who first encounters Zoe in the ultimate New York version of ""meet cute"" as the two simultaneously hop into the same cab. Zoe is fully prepared to go it alone as a single mom without a ""penis partner"" as they describe it at a support group but her budding romance with Stan rapidly complicates matters. Given that the two hook up relatively early they have to essentially take turns throwing petulant fits before gravitating back to each other. It doesnt help frankly that the supporting cast has so little to do; by rights third billing should go to Zoes pushcart-bound French bulldog. About halfway through for example Anthony Anderson rather inexplicably pops in as a playground dad serving scant purpose other than to regale Stan with homespun wisdom about fatherhood. Then again everything else is pretty much window dressing to admiring the central duo and in that respect OLoughlin actually occupies centerstage. Indeed despite a surprisingly direct discussion about the quality of Zoes ass as she laments pregnancys effect on those famous curves the movie seems to recognize its principal asset by laboring to depict Stan shirtless whenever possible. Even by standards of the genre its a weightless affair barring one fairly blue moment at a group childbirth session. The result is likely to test not only Lopezs movie-opening power -- inasmuch as nothing else technically or otherwise really distinguishes it from an evening spent watching Lifetime -- but CBS midsized movie strategy as well. At one point somebody says reassuringly ""In a years time this is just going to be a funny memory.""
