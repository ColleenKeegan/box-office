"CNN.com - Blue Crush crashes into theaters - August 16 2002 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH VIDEO LOCAL CNN NEWSWATCH E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US/HELP CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe CNNenEspanol.com CNNArabic.com set your edition Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW InStyle Business 2.0 Blue Crush crashes into theaters Kate Bosworth and Sanoe Lake talk surfing filming By Meriah DotyCNN ATLANTA Georgia (CNN) -- Take girls on surf boards big Hawaiian waves and cutting-edge cinematography and you have the ingredients for a different kind of teen movie -- ""Blue Crush"" opening Friday. ""This is a girl power film. Its definitely one I think girls will relate to more than men but as far as the cinematography in it -- its amazing"" says real-life surfer Sanoe Lake one of the films stars. On top of the many sunset surf and beach shots set to the films soundtrack (with tracks from MTV favorites like N.E.R.D. Beth Orton Nikka Costa Moby and Lenny Kravitz) ""Crushs"" plot revolves around talented surfer Anne Marie (played by Kate Bosworth) and her dream of winning the Pipe Masters competition on the North Shore of Oahu. The blonde tomboyish beauty and her beach-bum roomies (played by Lake and Michelle Rodriguez) struggle to make ends meet with low-wage maid jobs. Soon a dilemma unlike most seen in teenybopper drama flicks is presented to Anne Marie Should she place her bets on getting money via fame and surfing or from her new wealthy boyfriend? Picking it up MORE STORIES EW.COM Review Blue Crush the competition An idea that may sound like an update of an old ""Gidget"" film is pulled off on the big screen partly because the girls took time to pick up the sport. Bosworth 19 whos being hyped as Hollywoods next ""it"" girl spent two months learning how to surf before filming began. ""I never expected it to be so difficult. You see videos of pro surfers and they make it look so easy. I can vouch for how hard it is"" she says. Lake brags ""Kate went out and she was catchin waves on a short board standing up. I know some girls whove been surfing for about two years who are still having trouble getting onto a short board."" Keepin it real Grazer left and Stockwell filmed ""Crush"" on location in Oahu Hawaii. Director John Stockwell (""crazy/beautiful"") and producer Brian Grazer (""A Beautiful Mind"") who both surf recreationally did many things to depict the authentic look and feel of surfing. Among them was hiring Lake who had never acted before the shooting of ""Crush."" The once competitive female surfer supports the realistic feel thats boasted as a selling point of the film. ""John Stockwell captured the essence of what its like to be a female surfer. ... Hed be out in the line-up sitting there on his surf board directing. And its big pipe"" But for those who arent into girls on surfboards Bosworth and Lake believe the movie is worth watching for the cinematography alone. Indeed critics who have pooh-poohed the plot have raved about the movies surfing sequences. ""[The filmmakers] take you out to pipeline which is one of the heaviest waves in the world and theyll basically take every single person sitting in their seat in the theater and bring them out into the ocean. Thats what its going to feel like"" Lake says. ""You actually get to see what it looks like to be inside of a barrel from a surfers perspective"" she adds. No girlfights Bosworth left and Lake say they got along well during the filming of ""Crush."" During filming Bosworth Rodriguez and Lake lived together in a house on Sunset Beach in Oahu. ""We never fought. We got along so well and its interesting because we have such different personalities"" Bosworth says. Lake agrees ""We were a perfect blend. It wasnt like Oh get out of the bathroom I need to blow-dry my hair. Plus were all really low maintenance. Wed all just roll outta bed and just go straight to set. It wasnt even an issue."" They say it was not the party house either. ""We were on 12 hours a day 6 days a week. At the end of the day youre done. Youre just tired. You want to go to bed"" Lake explains. Both actresses are not placing their bets on acting. Bosworth has plans to attend Princeton in 2003 though she says ""You never know."" Lake plans to stay close to the water regardless of the movies success. ""I love acting but well see what happens"" she says. ""Ill always be a surfer.""

"Blue Crush Surfs Up washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Blue Crush Surfs Up Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 16 2002 IT HAS been quite some time since Ive seen crashing waves used A? without irony A? as a metaphor for sex but there it was in ""Blue Crush"" a wet and wild paean to the subculture of female surfers. Zoom in for the open-mouthed kiss stay tight on the clinch cut away to a shot of roaring surf aaand its back to the pan across morning sunlight falling on rumpled bed linens. The cinematic shorthand for nookie has been around since God was a boy but you know what? ""Blue Crush"" gets away with it. Thats because theres so much H2O in this film my notes had mildew on them the next day. According to the production notes 40 percent of ""Blue Crush"" was filmed on the water and youre going to be grateful it was. With eye-boggling footage of 20-foot-tall waves closing around you like a fist A? creating the much-sought-after ""pipe"" that surfers shoot through A? ""Blue Crush"" does for watersports what IMAXs ""To Fly"" did for being airborne. It makes the vicarious visceral taking you out of your cushioned seat and throwing you into the middle of a series of wall-high breakers that have the ability to snap your board A? or your neck A? on the coral reefs that line the ocean floor. What makes this virtual-reality ride so special is that your guides are not some tattooed muscle-bound surf rats in sun-bleached board shorts but a trio of cute young women. Despite the string bikinis ""Blue Crush"" has a straight-faced story to tell and formulaic though it may be its one of righteous girl power. From their shack on the Oahu beach roommates Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) work just enough to pay for rent electricity and food. The rest of the time theyre on the waves preparing Anne Marie for the upcoming Pipe Masters a surfing contest she has been invited to participate in thanks to her reputation as a one-time junior champion. But when Anne Marie loses her job as a maid at a posh hotel shes forced to give surfing lessons to a group of vacationing football players including quarterback Matt (Matthew Davis) a dreamboat who quickly starts to distract our heroine from her training. Top it off with the fact that Anne Marie is stuck raising her hellion younger sister (Mika Boorem) since their mother ran off to Vegas and toss in a paralyzing fear (thanks to Anne Maries near-drowning in competition three years ago) and youve got some serious pressure. Oh and never mind that her chosen field is a bastion of testosterone (after all the competitions not called ""Pipe Mistresses"" is it?). ""Blue Crush"" works on two levels. First its a pure celebration of riding the waves. Its in love with hydraulics. With the assistance of water camera operator Don King director John Stockwell (a surfing aficionado who co-wrote the script with Lizzy Weiss based on literary journalist Susan Orleans Outside magazine article ""Surf Girls of Maui"") jumps on top of and under the ocean to make his point. Second ""Blue Crush"" is a clear-eyed portrait of the unique kind of power that women possess a power that shows us that victory doesnt always mean vanquishing someone else. Either way its thrilling. BLUE CRUSH (PG-13 104 minutes) A? Contains frequent use of a four-letter word a fistfight implied sexuality unsafe driving and life-threatening watersports. Area theaters.

John Stockwells ""Blue Crush"" has all the trappings of an energetic extreme-sports adventure but ends up more of a creaky ""Pretty Woman"" retread with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought. ""XXX"" with breasts instead of biceps? ""The Fast and the Furious"" with surfboards instead of muscle cars? John Stockwells ""Blue Crush"" has all the trappings of an energetic extreme-sports adventure but ends up more of a creaky ""Pretty Woman"" retread with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and with the big-wave surfing that gives pic its title seemingly an afterthought. Given pics novelty (it is not the first but certainly the highest-profile movie with women surfers) and Universals aggressive youth-targeted marketing campaign ""Blue Crush"" should enjoy some fast if not furious late summer box office traffic with a long and healthy video afterlife to follow. In the grand tradition of sports and surf movies ""Blue Crush"" traces the buildup to a big surfing contest -- the Pipe Masters competition at the famous Pipeline break located on Oahus North Shore -- in which our heroine Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) will compete. When pic opens Pipe Masters is seven days away and Anne Marie like all good sports-movie heroines has several obstacles to overcome In addition single-handedly raising her younger sister (Mika Boorem) in a ramshackle beach house shes haunted by her near-drowning three years earlier at -- you guessed it -- Pipeline. When the surf isnt up Anne Marie and her two roommates -- Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) -- work as maids in a posh Sunset Beach hotel. Its there that Anne Marie rather awkwardly meets-cutes with Matt (Matthew Davis) an NFL quarterback who offers to pay Anne Marie for surfing lessons but who has his mind on much more than just surfing. The ensuing courtship between the poor girl from the wrong side of the tracks and the rich Prince Charming proves too cliche to grab aud interest. (Theres even a scene where Anne Marie overhears several of the other players girlfriends/wives making fun of her unpolished ways.) However ""Blue Crush"" doesnt get pulled down into a watery grave by their romance largely because of the shrewd casting of newcomer Bosworth who projects radiance delicacy uncertainty and inner strength. A major discovery Bosworth keeps ""Blue Crush"" paddling out against its own turbulent whitewater. But the movie never quite reaches the lineup. In adapting Susan Orleans article ""Surf Girls of Maui"" Stockwell and co-writer Lizzy Weiss skimp too much on local color in favor of timeworn Hollywood cliches and a measure of (literal) bathroom humor that might make Austin Powers blush. They also keep the always interesting Rodriguez saddled on the sidelines with a one-dimensional caricature of the ""jealous best friend"" culminating in a scene where Rodriguez Mrs. Danvers-style longingly watches an old surf video of Anne Marie in her prime. To Stockwells credit there are some satisfying moments quiet observations about surf culture (calling to check the local wave report before youve even opened your eyes in the morning; sitting in the lineup waiting waiting waiting for a wave to come along) that will ring true for novice and longtime surfers alike. And theres an undeniable sexiness to both the cast and the surf that will no doubt inspire a new crop of moviegoers (and female moviegoers in particular) to get out there and pick up a board.Admittedly ""Blue Crush"" isnt really after an exploration of surfing ethos in the way of Bruce Browns early films or Zalman Kings ""In Gods Hands."" Its more concerned with breakneck-paced montage sequences scored to some of the two-dozen pop ballads that comprise pics soundtrack. But pics grave disappointment is that its surf footage doesnt truly wow us. Stockwell gets us inside waves all right but he overly manipulates the footage -cutting between a dizzying array of angles speeding things up and slowing things down -- only occasionally pausing to capture that ethereal ballet of surfer and wave moving in tandem.

(HANDOUT PHOTO) Kate Bosworth in BLUE CRUSH. (HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT Blue Crush just one big wipeout 1 / 1 Back to Gallery BLUE CRUSH Drama. Starring Kate Bosworth Michelle Rodriguez and Matthew Davis. Directed by John Stockwell. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The poster for ""Blue Crush"" which has been all over buses and billboards this summer shows three young women in bikinis holding surfboards and looking into destiny. Its so gloriously ridiculous that it has made the movie seem promising -- every summer could use a trashy surfing movie after all. But theres nothing glorious about ""Blue Crush."" The movie takes a recent phenomenon -- young female surfers are becoming a presence on Oahus North Shore -- and renders it stultifying. How could anyone make a dull movie out of the ""surf girls"" of Oahu? Let us count the ways. One way is to make the movie not about the girls not about the unique phenomenon but about one girl in particular who has the usual set of problems no money. The rent is due. Her mother has abandoned her younger sister in her care. Kate Bosworth plays Anne Marie who works as a maid in a posh hotel while dreaming of one day making the cover of a surfing magazine. The other young women are subordinate at best. Michelle Rodriguez (""Girlfight"" ""The Fast and the Furious"") has been a scowling arresting presence in her other movies but here she has a lackluster role whose function is only to offer encouragement to Anne Marie. She tells her to train hard for the big Pipe Masters surf competition. And keeps telling her. The third in the trio Lena (Sanoe Lake) has even less to do. In the outdoor scenes she stands on the beach. In the indoor scenes she sits on a sofa. Shes there but thats about all. WATERLOGGED The surf scenes are badly shot. Anytime anybody picks up a board its an excuse for a montage of shaky images some above water some underwater accompanied by bubble-gum hip-hop dance music. In several cases the surf scenes appear computer generated with what looks like a picture of a surfing woman digitally inserted into a blue computer field. Some surf movies fail because they take surfing too seriously dwelling on the spiritual sense that comes from riding on the surface of a mighty power. ""Blue Crush"" fails for the opposite reason. It doesnt take surfing seriously enough. It could be any sport. Anne Marie merely has a generic case of the great American ambition to win big and to make loads of money. NO REASON TO CARE Even then she barely has enough ambition to make us care about her. Early in the movie she starts dating an NFL quarterback (Matthew Davis) and from there the movie sets up a false conflict Should she continue seeing this guy or should she prepare for the surfing competition? Theres absolutely no reason she cant do both. Its not really Bosworths fault but Anne Maries whininess and lack of focus make her an unappealing heroine. John Stockwell who also co-wrote the movie directs with a clumsy hand. In fact aside from the presence of sound the first half hour of ""Blue Crush"" reminded me very much of the way movies were made circa 1915 before directors understood how to tell a story with pictures. There are long shots where there should be medium shots and medium shots where we need close-ups and important story points go by in a blur unemphasized so that we can barely follow whats going on. And this is a surfing movie. It shouldnt be that hard to figure whats going on. . This film contains sexual content.

"Blue Crush | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blue-crush ) Blue Crush (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli I suppose Blue Crush can be viewed as a ""guilty pleasure"" with an emphasis on the first word of that phrase over the second one. The movie the latest directorial effort from John Stockwell (Crazy/Beautiful) is redeemed to one degree or another by some innovative camera work during the surfing sequences. However Blue Crushs attempts at character building resort to clichA(c)s and formulas that occasionally lead the movie down annoying paths. The film would have been more enjoyable had the balance shifted in favor of water-bound action over the land-based ""drama"" but the emphasis on the latter leaves Blue Crush waterlogged. Ask me a baseball question and I can probably answer it. I also have a fairly extensive understanding of football (American style) and basketball. But when it comes to surfing I admit knowing next-to-nothing especially when it comes to the rules and regulations of competition. After viewing Blue Crush my knowledge base hasnt been noticeably expanded. The film could have used a little more time spent in the water and less wasted on the beaches and in the beds of a swanky Maui resort. Watching this movie is a little like the ebb and flow of tides - it peaks when the characters are surfing then bottoms out when theyre on dry land. Stockwell and his cinematographer David Hennings have devised some innovative ways to present the ocean scenes. Instead of shooting them straight-on which is standard for surfing movies (and ESPN) Stockwell mixes things up occasionally going with overhead images and often taking the camera under water. Some of the shots seem too good to be true (closer to the action than a steady camera could possibly get) but whatever method was used to capture them (digital trickery perhaps?) it works. And any stunt doubling of which there is probably a fair amount is effectively obfuscated. The story is hum-drum - a kind of surfer girls version of Rocky although Blue Crush could have used more training sequences and Bananaramas ""Cruel Summer"" isnt quite on par with Bill Contis ""Gonna Fly."" Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) is a would-be surfing champion whose promising career came to a screeching halt three years ago when she almost drowned. Now shes seeking to get into the national spotlight and snag a sponsor by surfing in Hawaiis most prestigious competition Pipemasters. But the waves are big - really big - and Anne Maries confidence isnt at an all-time high. She is urged on by her posse tough-talking Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) sunny Lena (Sanoe Lake) and her smart little sister Penny (Mika Boorem). And she has a new boyfriend NFL quarterback Matt Tollman (Matthew Davis) whos on the island to play in the Pro Bowl. Blue Crush tries to appeal to teenagers of both genders. For the girls its a female empowerment story - a ""classic"" tale of women triumphing over the elements without help from men. In fact the guys in this story are not treated all that well. Matt although attractive and attentive is shown to be something of a cad and the rest of the films males are used for comic relief (like the surfing offensive lineman). For teenage boys this is a diluted Tamp;A flick. Of course considering the PG-13 rating theres not much ""A"" and even less ""T"". One gratuitous butt shot and a few cleavage flashes pretty much sum it up. Acting is not Blue Crushs forte. The performances are serviceable but nothing more. The lead is played by Kate Bosworth who previously had a role in Remember the Titans. She looks good in a bathing suit but her performance is a little less flexible than her board. Michelle Rodriguez once again has a supporting part as an unhappy-looking chick with no real backstory and little purpose other than to stand around looking mean. To say that she has been underused since Girlfight is to understate matters. Neither Sanoe Lake nor Mika Boorem does anything to stand out. One of the stated intentions of Stockwell and co-writer Lizzy Weiss (who based her story on a magazine article by by Susan Orlean) was to make a surfing movie about the sport as it really is rather than as it has been portrayed in other Hollywood-funded motion pictures. (Point Break is a sore spot with them.) To the extent that Blue Crush is about surfing it does a good job. But when only about 40-odd minutes out of 100 are spent in the water that leaves a lot of space to fill and thats where the movie has problems. Without the impressive photography and energetic action sequences Blue Crush would have been a lot worse. But if the filmmakers had invested in real characters instead of cardboard cut-outs it would have been a lot better.

Johnson) B+ Blue Crush Genre Romance Action/Adventure; Starring Kate Bosworth Sanoe Lake Michelle Rodriguez Mika Boorem Matthew Davis Faizon Love; Director John Stockwell; Author Lizzy Weiss; Producer (person) Brian Grazer; Release Date Wide 08/16/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 103; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Universal Posted August 14 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT Blue Crush is a surfer-babe movie so tactile it practically dunks the audience in the water. As the pastel dawn breaks with psychedelic beauty over Maui Anne Marie (Kate Bosworth) a tough but vulnerable apple-cheeked blond jock and Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake) the two buddies with whom she shares a tumbledown island home get up hours before work to slip in some early board time. On the ocean surface the camera floats and bobs and hangs out with them much as it did in ""Jaws"" and as the waves arrive many of them 30 or 40 feet tall were invited to suddenly stare upward the shiny aqua walls of water looming like Godzilla as the surfers rise to their feet and stand tall on their boards drawing on that most singular of athletic qualities. Sublime balance? Rock-hard calf muscles? Hardly. Im talking about the willingness to plunge into a moment of absolute topsy-turvy torso-ripping chaos. ""Blue Crush"" an end-of-the-summer revel in beach sun surf pretty faces and buff bods (hey there arent even any serious bad guys - just a few bad bellies) is an engaging formulaic sports drama that carries a charge of genuine excitement. Powered by Blestenations hip-hop remix of Bananaramas great ""Cruel Summer"" the movie has a purely sense-orama dimension yet John Stockwell who cowrote and directed it proves that its more than possible to use thrill-ride techniques in a supple nonbombastic way. His interweaving of digital effects rapid-fire downshifts to slow motion and back and whooshing crashing in-your-ears sound creates a foam peak momentum of exhilaration laced with anxiety. As each new wave arrives and crests a surfer will jockey to find an angle and then in that glorious instant when shes up and riding the rush kicking in...thats when the hard part starts. The wave begins to curl and crash on top of her and the surfer breaks left threading herself through the eye - a 60-ton tunnel of collapsing wave. The camera shows us just what it looks like and more important what it feels like when youre standing on a surging carpet of water that is breaking up into an avalanche of liquid force. Kate Bosworth has such a perfect American cheerleader-goddess look that its easy at first not to register the character in her face. Yet shes playful in a brisk no-nonsense way that grows on you; she gives Anne Marie the graceful determined obsessiveness of an athlete who knows that shes fated to compete forever with herself. It was a smart move to make a picture about new-style feminine surf bums without turning it into a teen-demagogic girls-vs.-guys showdown. ""Blue Crush"" hardly has to proselytize for girl power - its there in every glance every move that Anne Marie and her friends make. The movie sketches out their lifestyle showcasing the airy occasionally gross drudgery of their day jobs as maids at a luxury hotel. The conflicts however are all in Anne Marie a great surfer who longs to be a sponsored pro but whos hobbled by hesitation because of the nearly fatal wipeout she suffered while trying to surf one of the islands ""pipe"" waves which are so gigantic theyre legendary mortal threats. The movie provides staggering underwater views of a ""hold down"" when youre plunged with total spatial disorientation into the surf submerged and trapped by the wave above the coral reefs rising up to meet your head the water exploding like a bomb. ""Blue Crush"" is built around Anne Maries fear of that feeling every time she gets up on a board. With just one week to go until the big pipe contest Anne Marie battling jitters meets Matt (Matt Davis from ""Legally Blonde"") a cuddly and chivalrous NFL quarterback whos vacationing at the hotel along with a crew of his teammates. Fed up with her job she agrees to give him surf lessons and they fall into bed. The trouble is...well actually the only real trouble is that the movie has to trump this up into some sort of bogus class/money/commitment issue otherwise there wouldnt be a movie. As Eden Michelle Rodriguez a sexy spitfire whos in danger of turning into a ticker tape of attitude doesnt have much to do apart from the thankless task of berating Anne Marie for copping out on surf practice. Later Matt gets pushed around by bullies for the crime of surfing at a locals-only beach at which point it may start to dawn on you that the movie is basically killing time before the contest. Its worth the wait. The final 20 minutes of ""Blue Crush"" can stand as one of the few highlights in a movie summer of mostly hollow action-carnival fireworks. The trick for once isnt that were watching superhuman stunts; its that were watching deeply human stunts. When Anne Marie gets tossed off that board were dying for her to stand up and face another cascading water wall but the stakes could hardly be steeper. As the waves arrive each one mightier than the last ""Blue Crush"" invites us to acknowledge and triumph over something blockbusters like ""Attack of the XXX Spider-Clones"" merely fantasize their way out of the fear of flying.
