Sundance Review Was Kenneth Lonergans Manchester By the Sea Worth the 10 Million Price Tag? Eric Kohn Jan 25 2016 1112 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk READ MORE The 2016 Sundance Film Festival Bible The commodification of art can easily hijack discussions of its worth but when art lands in a marketplace the lines tend to blur. So it comes with the territory that the enthusiasm greeting the Sundance premiere of Kenneth Lonergans followup to his 2011 sleeper hit ""Margaret"" the sullen family drama ""Manchester By the Sea"" has been accompanied by news of a lucrative deal. Amazons 10 million acquisition for U.S. rights to the movie suggest high hopes for the film to have broad appeal and serious awards consideration. Certainly the company will push for it. But is it worth the cash-fueled hype? Thats a trickier question. Lonergans come-from-behind saga with ""Margaret"" his ambitious coming-of-age tale that was embroiled in studio bickering and rescued by a passionate crusade of supportive critics makes it easy to root for ""Manchester By the Sea"" to set things right. And indeed where ""Margaret"" went broad and ambitious with a sprawling operatic storyline ""Manchester"" aims for more conventional territory. Casey Affleck excels in the role of alienated handyman Lee Chandler a gruff New Englander who returns to his small hometown after the sudden death his older brother (Kyle Chandler seen in several flashbacks). Left to care for his 16-year-old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges) Lee struggles to reconcile his grief-stricken present with an even darker past which involves the tragedy that ruined his marriage to Randi (Michelle Williams) and their settled life with two children. Creeping around town in the contemporary scenes Lee copes with judgmental stares from locals and questions his ability to escape his old reputation. On paper then ""Manchester"" offers nothing more than a by-the-numbers look at broken families searching for new beginnings but Lonergan knows this brand of dramaturgy better than most. With cinematographer Jody Lee Lipes turning the drab landscape into an expression of Lees alienated state each wide shot complicates the mood. But its Lonergans masterfully subtle writing littered with awkward exchanges that speak far louder than any cohesive monologue that gives ""Manchester"" its humanity. Punctuated by disarming humor many scenes feel so raw they border on documentary. While Afflecks subdued delivery gels with Lonergans tone its rising star Hedges who gives the movie its liveliest moments. Rocking out with his teen band and attempting to get it on with his girlfriend behind her intrusive mothers back Patrick epitomizes the eager spirit now drained from Lees existence. When Patrick considers moving in with his recovering alcoholic mother (now wedded to a devout Christian played by Matthew Broderick in a distracting cameo) Lee does his part to step in. But on some level he seems resigned to failing at his attempts at inheriting his brothers paternal role. Patrick wants a new beginning; Lee has lost faith in such a possibility under any circumstances. As Lonergan explores the gap between these two men ""Manchester"" hardly throws any curveballs into the mix. This is ultimately a smart grounded premise that breaks few rules. But Lonergan wrings so many nuanced exchanges out of a first-rate set of performances that the story rarely drags or rings false. This is a filmmaker who excels at the slow-and-steady approach. While hes been a prolific playwright its remarkable that Lonergan has only made three features in 16 years starting with 2000s ""You Can Count On Me"" -- which also chronicled a damaged small town family dealing with the aftermath of a tragedy. Lonergan complicates such tropes with gentle touches. In ""Manchester"" Lee responds to news of his brothers death with a dismissive ""Fuck this"" then pauses long enough to consider his outburst and apologize. Such pensive beats imbue the proceedings with an authentic emotional foundation. Similarly Lonergan pads out the running time with prolonged sequences based around minor events. In one of the standout bits Patrick asks his uncle to accompany his nephew to his girlfriends house to distract the girls mother. But the cringe-worthy outcome hardly plays out as planned. Woefully weak on strong female characters ""Manchester"" has plenty of strong men. The gruff New Englanders populating the insular setting who seem always on the brink of various physical altercations at the local bar speak to the narrow set of possibilities that the town allows. While already a drifter when he returns Lee finds that Manchester only exacerbates his frustrations with the world. While uncertain about taking on a paternal role in his nephews life Lee eventually becomes the boys best hope for thinking beyond the limitations of his surroundings. Expectations of a sweeping accomplishment work against this form of low key storytelling. When the usual emotions surrounding fear and resentment bubble up they reveal nothing new and the tension dissipates in the third act. Lonergans predilection toward understatement underserves the big picture. Nevertheless ""Manchester"" represents a formula transformed into layers of pathos rather than overbearing histrionics. If theres a commercial demand for this type of narrative -- and Amazons lucrative deal suggests as much -- ""Manchester"" stands out for doing an old routine just right. Its not the next best thing but it does justice to a familiar playbook. Grade B+ Amazon will release ""Manchester By the Sea"" later this year.

If you have the nerve as a white writer to question anything at all about Birth of a Nation and its record-shattering sale in this year it will be a credit to your nerve but thats about it. It would be equally obnoxious and irrelevant to the already obnoxious and questionably relevant job youre supposed to be doing Writing criticism about a medium to which you yourself have no will or skill to contribute as a creator or financier. If you have any sense at all or any sense of fair play ask yourself a simple question Who is cynically and inappropriately conflating art and commerce here? 1) The filmmakers for wanting to sell their work? (You get paid to write yes? Youd like a raise yes?) 2) The companies who buy and distribute films? Do you feel there should be no companies to buy and distribute films? Or just that they should do so according to your strictures of what is and isnt a pure-of-heart amount of money from a pure-of-heart buyer? Lots of ideas about how things you cant do should be done; no trace of shame or humility about saying so authoritatively and publicly.) Or 3) Are YOU the only one inappropriately conflating art and commerce here by weaving into your film review (already an innately repulsive and arrogant undertaking) your indignation about the purchaser the amount of the purchase and its relation to your idea about the quality of the film? You are already a member of an innately shameful profession. Why drop even lower than you have to? Or is it simply an extension of the critics natural function To make public and authoritative pronouncements without embarrassment or humility on the work of others that he himself cant do or hasnt got the gumption to attempt. Reply Justin Z May 12 2016 1253 pm Indiewire you never cease to amaze me at your backhanded approach to reviewing. Are we seriously going to start the critical backlash before the movie has even been bought or theatrically distributed? Just review the freaking movie outside of the hype. Everyone else has and while not EVERYONE loved it a lot of people did and have very thorough explanations for why they loved it. You cant discredit that simply because you balk at the 10 million price tag. Reply Reg May 12 2016 1253 pm So youre insinuating that Amazon are fools who dont know what theyre doing with zero knowledge of their long term plans? Or their goals for this purchase? Or their definition of success? And a casual inspection of the overwhelming majority of the early reviews demonstrates the excitement about this film preceded the sale. So ""cash fueled hype"" is an invention of your own making. Reply Sand May 12 2016 1253 pm Jesus were having backlash to distribution deals now? ""Is it worth the cash-fueled hype?"" No one except lame wannabe industry insiders cares. Take out all the references to the Amazon deal and youre left with the positive non-embarassing review you would have written until you felt you needed to have your ""hot take"" on the sale.

The persistence of grief and the hope of redemption are themes as timeless as dramaturgy itself but rarely do they summon forth the kind of extraordinary swirl of love anger tenderness and brittle humor that is ""Manchester by the Sea"" Kenneth Lonergans beautifully textured richly enveloping drama about how a death in the family forces a small-town New Englander to confront a past tragedy anew. That rather diagrammatic description does little justice to Lonergans ever-incisive ear for the rhythms of human conversation as he orchestrates an unruly suite of alternately sympathetic and hectoring voices -- all of which stand in furious contrast to Casey Afflecks bone-deep performance as a man whom loss has all but petrified into silence. Giving flesh and blood to the idea that life goes on even when it no longer seems worth living ""Manchester"" may be too sprawling a vision for all arthouse tastes but Lonergans many champions are scarcely the only viewers who will be stirred by this superbly grounded and acted third effort. Premiering at Sundance 16 years after Lonergan made his prize-winning debut there with ""You Can Count on Me"" ""Manchester by the Sea"" is recognizably of a piece with both that film and its troubled long-gestating follow-up. Finally released in 2011 after years of legal and logistical wrangling ""Margaret"" was a magnificent ruin whose defenders and detractors could nonetheless agree that Lonergan remained one of the most distinctive writing talents on the American indie scene. Although far less likely to polarize than its predecessor the new film offers a similarly bold merging of ensemble drama and character study all in service of a story about how a person -- and crucially the surrounding community -- choose to deal or not deal with the consequences of a fatal mistake. The various and venerable spirits of ""The Sweet Hereafter"" ""Ordinary People"" and ""In the Bedroom"" may hover over this movie in wintry setting and theme but ""Manchester by the Sea"" is very much its own singular seething creation. We first encounter Lee Chandler (Affleck) as a hard-working taciturn Boston janitor/handyman whose daily routine of unclogging toilets and painting walls offers scant distraction from the throes of some all-consuming private anguish. Whether on the job or at a bar after work Lee isnt one for small talk and he seems more inclined to converse with his fists whenever push comes to shove. Gray skies and falling snow have rarely looked so forlorn; this truly is the winter of Lees discontent and clearly the latest of many. When he receives the news that his beloved older brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) has died of a heart attack he doesnt seem to grow any more solemn or inarticulate than he already is even as he makes the lonely drive up to Manchester-by-the-Sea the Massachusetts hometown that cruel and as-yet undisclosed circumstances forced him to abandon years earlier. Those circumstances are gradually shaded in through a steady succession of flashbacks to happier times and theyre not woven into the main drama so much as dropped in with stark discomfiting abruptness. We see Lee enjoying idyllic afternoons with Joe and his son Patrick (Ben OBrien) sailing their rickety old boat in the Manchester harbor; Joe receiving the diagnosis of congestive heart failure that presumably drove his wife Elise (Gretchen Mol) to hit the bottle and ultimately end their marriage; Lee playing the role of fun-loving family man to his loving but exasperated wife Randi (Michelle Williams) and their three young children; and in a harrowingly sad sequence the pointless unspeakable tragedy that drove Lee to his current life of remote solitude. The use of flashbacks to connect emotional fragments and convey narrative detail can too easily become a screenwriters crutch and it will take time for attentive audiences to adjust to the herky-jerky rhythms of ""Manchester by the Sea""; this is not a film overtly concerned with easing you into its world of sorrow. But gradually enough the pieces start to snap ever more absorbingly into place and the blunt matter-of-factness with which Lonergan pivots between past and present comes to make a deeper thematic sense. For those like Lee who have endured the very worst neither the present nor the future can offer any relief from the past and a sudden near-accident or a poorly chosen word can bring the most painful memories rushing back to the surface. An American filmmaker unusually attuned to the messiness and clumsiness of most everyday interaction Lonergan steers Lee and his few remaining friends and family members through the forced awkward rites of bereavement. But Lee is completely unprepared for the bombshell that per Joes wishes he is the legal guardian of Patrick (Lucas Hedges) -- now a popular sometimes temperamental and perpetually horny teenager for whom the full realization of his fathers passing clearly has yet to fully register. Presently the lad remains mostly concerned with being a hockey star playing in his rock band trying to get into the pants of two different girlfriends and making sure that his Uncle Lee doesnt mess things up for him too badly. Just as ""Manchester by the Sea"" avoids the pitfalls of that most overworked of dramatic templates the death-of-a-child meller so it mercifully avoids devolving into one of those tidy odd-couple therapy exercises where two mismatched souls each become the healing that the other needs. Instead the movie is focused honestly and entirely on how Lee and his fellow survivors cope with the here and now all of them stumbling forward one day at a time and realizing the world doesnt slow down for their benefit. Most of them probably know it already These are people with hard minds and thick skins and nearly all of them speak in the foul-mouthed salty-surly idiom that is as much a fixture of their milieu as the biting cold and the briny sea air (conveyed with an almost palpable texture and forlorn grace by the brilliant d.p. Jody Lee Lipes). Lonergan arranges all these raucous voices into a chorus of overlapping lines and halting cadences and on more than one occasion you may find yourself wishing some of them would shut up already. That extends even to the music courtesy of composer Lesley Barber and music supervisor Linda Cohen which adds yet another deliberate layer of cacophony There are moments when a classical piece or an old blues standard rise to a pitch well beyond that of mere background accompaniment. Only a wordless beautifully harmonized vocal performance recurring at key intervals offers the respite of something resembling silence. Most of the likely criticisms of Lonergans film will likely center on its wild swings from mournful minor-key drama to tart tetchy comedy which would make sense if the events being depicted naturally lent themselves to exacting tonal discipline. But the inelegance of the storytelling here is of the sort that testifies not to a filmmakers sloppiness but rather to the messiness of real life. ""Manchester by the Sea"" may not be as formally and structurally daring as ""Margaret"" but in its steady forceful accumulation of perspectives it emerges a movie of similarly symphonic ambitions and fierce uncompromising performances. Doing his best and most sustained acting since ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" Affleck finds the eloquence in his characters ineloquence; our brief glimpses of his more playful carefree self throw the enormity of his trauma into stark relief. Yet the performance never feels lifeless or anesthetized; even Afflecks mumbling evasions are charged with feeling. By the end we have a clear understanding of Lee Chandler as a good man bravely re-engaging with his former life the only way he knows how and being honest enough to acknowledge that it may be too much too soon. Affleck has a terrific foil in the 19-year-old Hedges (""Moonrise Kingdom"" ""Kill the Messenger"") playing Patrick as a ball of rowdy tempestuous adolescent energy who nonetheless submits with surprising ease to his uncles instruction as though recognizing his need for an authority figure in his fathers absence. Chandler is wonderful as Lees sturdy salt-of-the-earth brother; that we always want to see more of him on screen renders his absence all the more haunting. And it wouldnt be a Lonergan movie if he and his regular collaborator Matthew Broderick didnt show up making appearances of an almost comically tossed-off brevity. While ""Manchester by the Sea"" is very much about uncles nephews fathers and sons Lonergan always a superb director of actresses gives the women in his ensemble their due. Its been a while since Williams had a role this good but shes lost none of her unerring knack for emotional truth in the meantime and she has one astonishing scene that rises from the movie like a small aria of heartbreak. And as Patricks mother Mol gets one short but powerful late moment in which she tries to reconnect with the son she barely knows and her words seem to distill the energy and emotion of this remarkable movie into one line ""You dont have to be so formal."" As Lonergan knows its often hard enough just to be human. Sundance Film Review Manchester by the SeaReviewed at Sundance Film Festival (Premieres) Jan. 23 2016. Running time 137 MIN.

TWITTER Kenneth Lonergans latest starring Casey Affleck Michelle Williams and Lucas Hedges is a wrenching drama about a grief-stricken New England family. A wrenching family tragedy is dramatized with the depth of a high-quality American stage piece in Manchester by the Sea. Kenneth Lonergans third feature film since his debut 16 years ago with his Sundance entry You Can Count On Me is deeply rooted in its New England setting and characters led by the traumatized working-class Joe played by Casey Affleck in what is by far his most impressive and deeply felt screen performance to date. The overextended second half shouldnt be too difficult to trim down to bring the film closer to a two-hour running time which would make this a good bet for a class distributor looking for a full-bodied autumn release. Although Manchester never feels stagy and is deeply enriched by the mostly coastal communities in which it is set this is clearly the work of a writer who knows his way around creating characters and emotional dynamics in a manner more evident in works for the stage than for screens big or small. Instead of using shorthand Lonergan layers and then layers some more allows his characters to stew not always disclose themselves and then come to decisions and changes naturally or after due deliberation. And they can relapse and not always be ready for the breakthrough moment toward which the story seems to be pointing. The result is something that feels more akin to a full meal than the usual cinematic popcorn. At the outset the leading character could not be less prepossessing. Lee Chandler (Affleck) works as a handyman in some Boston apartment buildings cleaning toilets shoveling snow behaving rudely. One night he provokes a fight in a bar. He seems like an ass a no-account. Some brief ocean-fishing flashbacks show him as close to his brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) and the latters young son Patrick but thats long ago. Abruptly Joe dies of congestive heart failure which not only results in the woefully ill-suited Lee suddenly becoming guardian for the now-16-year-old Patrick (Lucas Hedges) but also exposes the numerous rifts in the family; there are a lot of burned bridges here and Lee is in no way equipped or emotionally disposed to try to repair them. Still there are legal responsibilities to be faced and rituals to be performed forcing some contact most of the family would prefer to avoid. As word gets around there are whispers about ""the Lee Chandler"" suggesting  a notoriety about him in these parts and Lonergan neatly shuffles the dramaturgical deck to introduce information that will later come to the fore. Among the seeds planted are Lees past marriage to Randi (Michelle Williams) now entirely out of the picture along with their two daughters similarly missing and Patricks mother Elise (Gretchen Mol) whose absence in the light of the boys fathers death throws responsibility for him to Lee. For fully an hour Lonergan makes these seemingly mundane characters and situations intriguing and interesting; one is assured that were just seeing pieces of the jigsaw puzzle that will eventually be filled in. Sure enough the big event the tragedy that changed all the characters lives forever is revealed at the one-hour point. Its a devastating occurrence to be sure but one with nuances of responsibility and shades of gray in terms of the potential ramifications for those who will have to deal with it for the rest of their lives. How the characters cope and relate after this is emotionally and psychologically fraught and often powerful but the focus narrows down to Lees relationship with the teenaged Patrick. The latter confounds his uncle by his constant screwing around with local girls while Lee continues to wrestle with his responsibilities toward the kid and briefly Randis renewed emotionalism. Everything Lonergan serves up is arguably germane but the pace noticeably slackens in the second half; some of the uncle/nephew scenes feel repetitive and the dramatic destination begins to feel like its just being pushed further and further down the track. The feeling here is that removing somewhere around 10 minutes from this section would be all to the good. From certain angles now resembling a scruffy version of the late Patrick McGoohan Affleck goes deeper here than ever before his odd posturing hesitations and sometimes scratchy speech now all seeming like a meaningful outgrowth and expression of his complex character no longer sometimes affectations. Young Hedges perhaps best known for his appearances in two Wes Anderson films Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel has a lot more to work with here and thoroughly impresses. Williams shares an extremely emotional late scene with Affleck thats written in a very daring way with their characters pushing adamantly in completely opposite directions and using different styles of expression; it almost comes off but not quite. In a different way a stilted luncheon reunion between Patrick and his mother and his previously unmet new stepfather (Matthew Broderick) feels rather archly artificial and unconvincing. Producer Matt Damon was set to play the leading role early on but other commitments intervened giving the part to Affleck. From a box-office point of view this makes a big difference but the dramatic results prove more than sound.

Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Nate Parker in The Birth of a Nation; Casey Affleck in Manchester by the Sea. Elliot Davis / Fox Searchlight; Claire Folger / Amazon ID 7857423 Manchester by the Sea contains the saddest goddamn invitation to lunch youll ever find in the movie -- the sort of scene that floors you with its emotional rawness all of it unfolding in a passing sidewalk encounter. To be fair there arent many films that attempt to leverage lunch the most innocuous of meals into a conversational symphony of love and pain. But thats playwright turned director Kenneth Lonergans latest for you. Manchester by the Seas deep wells of emotion are there like sinkholes waiting beneath the day-to-day the calls that must be made the appointments that cant be avoided the jobs that have to be completed to keep the world running.Manchester by the Sea is one of the two movies thats taken the Sundance Film Festival by storm this year and its the more deftly made but definitely the less surprising of the two -- the finest possible incarnation of the sort of starry delicate drama that is a festival standard the kind that would have a teary lunch invite. The other hit is Nate Parkers directorial debut The Birth of a Nation about Nat Turner leader of the 1831 Virginia slave rebellion a fierce historical saga that feels like it strains the seams of an annual event largely devoted to the intimate and quirky.

Claire Folger / Amazon ID 7857519 Theyre very different films but theyve both scored historic deals with Amazon nabbing the streaming rights for Manchester by the Sea for a massive 10 million after its premiere and The Birth of a Nation getting picked up by Fox Searchlight for a record-breaking 17.5 million. Theyre also both getting awards talk an exhausting thing to say when 2016s Oscars havent even happened yet but point made These are two films were going to spend the year talking about.Manchester by the Sea is centered on a Boston maintenance man named Lee Chandler played with breathtakingly submerged intensity by Casey Affleck. Lees been living a life of colorless isolation shoveling snow and plunging toilets and getting drunk alone at night and then into bar fights. The why of it all comes to light slowly after hes summoned home to the seaside town of the title up the Massachusetts coast after his older brother Joe (Kyle Chandler) dies and hes left in charge of his 16-year-old nephew Patrick (Lucas Hedges). Patricks a high school star an athlete with a lot of friends and more than one girlfriend -- hes a local boy who has no interest in selling his dads fishing boat and leaving behind everything he loves. But Lee it turns out has some very compelling reasons for not wanting to settle back in the close-knit home town he left years earlier the kind of place where everyone knows everyone and the past is never left to fade away. View this image > Affleck and Lucas Hedges in Manchester by the Sea. Claire Folger / Amazon ID 7857526 The more thats revealed about why Lee has chosen to live alone in a basement apartment far from his loved ones the less Manchester by the Sea seems like a story about how a grumpy bachelor and his outgoing nephew learn to share a home. Thats still part of it sure but more than that its about loss how grief ebbs and flows and exists alongside conversations about Star Trek and trying to get laid and about how it can sweep some people away maybe permanently.The films characters are working-class New Englanders who bicker and rag on one another easily but who arent always so free with expressing their feelings. Instead Manchester by the Sea lets details about its characters and their pasts accrue holding them up to the light and turning them to highlight every facet of their wounded vulnerable wholes. And while Affleck is day-wreckingly excellent he gets backup from a strong array of supporting players particularly a tremendous Michelle Williams as Lees ex-wife.Lonergan hasnt always had an easy time making movies. Margaret his last feature was delayed for years due to issues over final cut resulting in lawsuits and a film that was critically acclaimed but a box office bomb. Even after that he was able to get this new work made with help from producer Matt Damon originally also set to star. But The Birth of a Nations director screenwriter and star Nate Parker has had a tougher go of getting funding for his Nat Turner passion project. Hes been working on the film for seven years and was repeatedly told it wasnt commercially viable.Parker whos starred in movies like Beyond the Lights and Non-Stop and who got a standing ovation in the theater before The Birth of a Nation even screened actually quit acting to raise and contribute to what ended up being the 10 million he needed for The Birth of a Nation which he named after D. W. Griffiths racist landmark 1915 silent movie. View this image > Parker and Aja Naomi King in The Birth of a Nation. Elliot Davis / Fox Searchlight ID 7858022 Theres nothing particularly indie about The Birth of a Nation other than that studios were too chickenshit to fund it. Its a Braveheart-style historical saga made in the model of a big studio production even if it was done on the relatively cheap -- Mel Gibson after all was able to get 70-plus million to make his own story of a righteous uprising and won Oscars for it. But Parker could very well do the same. He made a passionate rousing and occasionally hokey movie in the same tenor centered on a man who grows up in a system in which he and his family and his people are treated as subhuman and who decides its not just necessary but his holy chosen task to lead an uprising against their oppressors.Turner was born more than two centuries ago but his story retains all of its urgency and fury. Parker is well-aware that when a character notes in the aftermath of the rebellion that people are getting murdered ""for no reason at all but being black"" its a statement as resonant now as it was then and through the decades in between. The Birth of a Nation leans into the systemic horror of slavery from the owner who casually knocks out a mans teeth with a hammer and chisel to ease his force-feeding to the way an auctioneer tears the dress off the woman hes trying to sell to better tempt the leering men in the crowd. When Nat and his cohorts explode into violence its as an answer to lifetimes of receiving it. View this image > Armie Hammer and Parker in The Birth of a Nation. Elliot Davis / Fox Searchlight ID 7857541 Most boldly The Birth of a Nation refuses to portray its slaveholders as just brutal sociopaths who can be easily put at a distance and it doesnt excuse them because sometimes theyre nice. Young Nat is shown playing as a child with the boy who grows up to be Samuel (Armie Hammer) his owner a man who steps in to protect him from time to time but still looks at him as a prize possession one he starts farming out as a preacher to agitated slaves on other plantations. Nat is horrified by what he sees at these places and sickened by the way hes forced to use his faith as a tool of placation. Samuels disturbed as well -- though not enough to do anything about the monstrous system from which hes benefiting or to question his place in it or to expect Nat to feel anything other than grateful for not being abused. Feeling bad counts rightly for nothing in The Birth of a Nation.The Birth of a Nation has its flaws -- its the work of a first-time filmmaker who has some great instincts (the last shot) and some clunkier ones in particular how the religious visions Turner had are realized. Its female characters -- mainly Aunjanue Ellis as Nats mother and Aja Naomi King as Cherry the woman he marries -- are thinly developed and when one of them is brutally assaulted its portrayed in a way that has far more to do with what it means to Nat than to the victim. But these are complaints that could be lodged at a lot of big movies and The Birth of a Nation feels very much like a big movie one that belongs in wide release among other films that have transmuted history into heroic cinema. Turner deserves this treatment; he deserves a film that doesnt soften the era or apologize in any way for his anger; and he deserves a salute for making it happen especially at a time when the movies desperately need a story like this.

Photo AP MORE FROM Kyle Smith Indignation is an important devastating look at 50s youth Thrilling Nerve never takes its foot off the pedal Bad Moms good laughs The worst Bourne movie is still pretty good Trumps RNC speech wasnt just a success -- it was a smash hit A wrenching family drama with an intensity to rival ""Ordinary People"" or ""In the Bedroom"" writer-director Kenneth Lonergans ""Manchester by the Sea"" stars a brilliant Casey Affleck as a tortured New England handyman picking up the shards of a broken past. Affleck plays Lee Chandler -- ""the Lee Chandler"" as another character remarks -- who does odd jobs for a landlord in Boston but is called back home to a small town north of there when he learns his older brother (Kyle Chandler) is mortally ill with congenital heart disease. Lonergan carves his narrative up into puzzle pieces only gradually revealing that he is jumping around in time to explore both Lees past and his present. Lee has a nephew (Lucas Hedges previously seen in a small part in ""Moonrise Kingdom"") now 16 with whom he once had a loving joshing relationship. Yet Lee is stunned to learn that his late older brother directed that Lee be the boys guardian. It isnt until an hour into the movie that the full dimensions of the back story come into focus and we learn more about Lees wife (a devastating Michelle Williams) his sister-in-law (Gretchen Mol who is miscast) and his determined introversion. Lee isnt particularly interested in following the script others have written for him. He just wants to be left alone to fix toilets and shovel snow. Lonergans beautifully empathetic and yet frequently angry sarcastic and funny screenplay gives the actors much to work with and yet the film doesnt carry the sense of being written at all. Crafting words is one thing; making them sound like things these verbally challenged characters would say requires another level of skill and if no one had told me who made the film I would have bet it was made by a true New Englander. Lonergan has delivered a 200-proof shot of lower-middle-class New England life. He captures the casual rudeness of the conversation between people who know each other well as well as the halting efforts to find something to discuss between those who dont. The look of the film made me wince with recognition -- the way New England guys walk around in the snow without a heavy coat the walnut hutches and the cheerfully ugly wallpaper the Jesus portrait over the mantel the creaky stairs in the clapboard houses. Williams miraculously even gets the accent right (though Chandler who grew up in Georgia doesnt). The film has a stately pace -- its more than two hours long -- and at times is punishing to watch so I dont expect it to attract a large audience. But Lonergan has sculpted this story and these characters with great delicacy and wisdom knowing exactly what to leave out and when like the sturdy types who populate this desolate landscape to draw back and walk away in sorrow. ""Manchester by the Sea"" is penetrating and filigreed at the same time and I expect it to attract a prestige distributor who would be smart to hold it until awards season.
