By Peter Rainer August 23 2008 Save for later Saved Emma Stone Rainn Wilson Josh Gad and Teddy Geiger are shown in a scene from The Rocker. George Kraychyk/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of With ""The Rocker"" Rainn Wilson joins the select company of Jack Black in ""School of Rock."" He plays Robert ""Fish"" Fishman a beaten-down insurance company employee who for a brief time in the 1980s was the drummer for a group called Vesuvius which soon after they kicked him out scaled the heights of hard-rock stardom. Hes never gotten over it.Fish has been idle until his nerdy nephew Matt (Josh Gad) asks him to be the last-minute choice for drummer of his garage band appropriately named A.D.D. Seized by visions of rock nirvana Fish goes back on his vow never to execute another rimshot. He also revives his ritual of practicing in the nude. YouTube turns him into an instant celebrity and pretty soon A.D.D. is on tour with the mother of the handsome lead singer-guitarist Teddy Geiger (played by Christina Applegate) in tow. Seemingly straight-laced she turns out to be a good match for Fishs gonzo gyrations.A whacked-out superannuated would-be rock star might seem to be too easy a comic target but Wilson gives this sad sack so many fresh twists that he never wears out his welcome. Like Black in ""School of Rock"" Wilson knows how to modulate the craziness; Fishs stillnesses are as funny and as oddball as his manic moments. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Is he talented? In a way but what counts here is that Fish is so passionate about his second chance at stardom that it really doesnt matter if hes any good or not. What matters is that hes fulfilling his gaudiest fantasies. This requires a surplus of costume changes - kimonos headbands leopard skin pants. For a drummer who likes to prance nude Fish sure likes his haberdashery. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Rocker Director Peter Cattaneo (""The Full Monty"") and his screenwriters Maya Forbes and Wally Wolodarsky have a light-hearted affinity for 80s rock. Many of the jokes are riffs not only on that era but also on other rock satires especially ""This Is Spinal Tap"" the ultimate classic of the genre. Theres nothing in ""The Rocker"" to equal the finest moments of that film in part because ""Tap"" had a superduper ensemble of comic actors. In ""The Rocker"" Emma Stone as the fourth member of the band and Jeff Garlin as Fishs brother-in-law have a few choice moments and so does Jason Sudeikis as the groups slimeball manager. But Wilson is pretty much the whole show. With nobody else around to steal from he ends up stealing scenes from himself.The numbers by A.D.D. and Vesuvius were all composed specifically for the movie and they could be sharper. So could the finale which fizzles when it should ignite. But Wilson is having so much fun cavorting and wailing and bawling and whooping that youd have to be made of stone not to cheer him on. Fishs talents may not be the highest but his spirits certainly are. Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for drug and sexual references nudity and language.)

A bit of a smoking volcano himself the erstwhile drummer finally explodes in response to one too many jibes from his office colleagues following the (now pretentiously English sounding) hair metal bands latest CD release fights with his partner and ends up taking refuge in his sisters attic overlooking the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. Will salvation lie via his sisters son Matts school band called ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder) or through Matts mates MILF (Mother Id Like to Fuck) mum (Christina Applegate)? Or did watching School of Rock perhaps tip off our hero about the recuperative power of rock cross-generational inspiration  and self-knowledge?Of course its one of the peculiarities of modern movies that their heroes seem sublimely and conveniently unacquainted with contemporary films. Likewise Peter Full Monty Cattaneo directs this likeable if unoriginal rock comedy as if Richard Linklaters film never existed. Wilson has the pudgy face sweat band and faux anger but not quite the same manic charisma as Jack Black and Cattaneo may lack Linklaters ensemble dexterity but nevertheless The Rocker is an enjoyable comedy-drama with a welcome almost low-key sobriety that adds to its quiet charm. Maya Forbes and Wallace Wolodarskys script is workaday but Cattaneo sidesteps its inadequacies by concentrating on characters and performances downplaying the obvious rock wannabe posturing and the films predictable gross-out elements and handling the romantic sub-plot with a welcome lack of self-consciousness and over-accentuation. As a movie it may not rock but it rolls along nicely enough.

But that just might happen at the fictional West Mesa High School in Tuscon Ariz. setting of the loony irreverent ""Hamlet 2."" Welcome to the world of failed-actor-turned-failed-drama-teacher Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan) who wants desperately to make a name for himself -- if only someone anyone students administrators could pronounce it. Marsh? Marsk? Mars? Whatever. Let others mount productions of ""Oklahoma"" and ""West Side Story."" Or if theyre really daring ""Sweeney Todd."" Dana goes for offbeat fare like an adaptation of ""Erin Brockovich"" starring his acolytes the sexually uncertain Rand (Skylar Astin) and the over-emoting Epiphany (Phoebe Strole). The school newspapers drama critic a junior Addison DeWitt but less kind scorns these efforts as does the principal who plans to shutter the drama department. Not that the move will markedly cut costs. Dana doesnt even receive a salary which may explain why rollerblades are his sole means of transportation. The guy is striking out on all fronts. Just ask his derisive wife Brie (the wonderful Catherine Keener) whos been trying to get pregnant for years. Vilified at school marginalized at home and ridiculed pretty much everywhere Dana determines to summon his muse. Though this be madness the result is a musical sequel to ""Hamlet"" whose dramatis personae include Jesus (as embodied by Dana himself). To describe the show as God-awful is like calling Dom Perignon a fizzy beverage. Lets just say that if Mel Brookss producers had known about Danas enterprise they would never have chosen ""Springtime for Hitler"" as their surefire flop. ENLARGE ""Hamlet 2"" a hit at this years Sundance Film Festival is the antidote to ""High School Musical."" The jokes dont always work; theres some disappointingly inspirational blah-blah that belongs in a far more well-behaved movie while a repetitive gag about a student bashing her head doesnt even rise to the level of sophomoric. But there is Amy Poehler in a terrific brief bit as an ACLU lawyer and Elisabeth Shue (playing herself) as a sympathetic nurse at a fertility clinic; even the star of ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and ""Cocktail"" cant catch a break in Hollywood these days. Mostly though theres the endlessly resourceful endlessly inventive bedazzling Mr. Coogan. Hamlet Schmamlet. Not since ""Death of a Salesman"" has failure been quite so entertaining. The Rocker ENLARGE Teddy Geiger (left) Josh Gad Rainn Wilson and Emma Stone in The Rocker. 20th C. Fox Teen comedies have become as ritualized as Kabuki. There is a carefully calibrated gross-out factor often having to do with regurgitation; a certain level of nudity generally involving the backsides of the least callipygian cast members and a particular quantity of beer-swilling always by those incapable of holding their liquor. ""The Rocker"" has the requisite vomit the view of some very unfortunate hind quarters and the suds. Its also got a vein of sweetness and charm. Robert ""Fish"" Fishman (Rainn Wilson Dwight on the hit NBC series ""The Office"") is an embittered 40-year-old and really who can blame him? Twenty years ago he was bound for glory as the drummer in Vesuvius a heavy metal band being courted by a major label. But the proffered contract came with a stipulation Replace the percussionist with the nephew of the record company head or no deal. Fishs frightfully loyal bandmates protested the vile nepotism the hideous injustice for a whole nanosecond before cheerfully signing on the dotted line. Vesuvius becomes wildly successful and Fish erupts every time he hears mention of the bands name. This volatility may help explain his inability to hold on to a job. After yet another dismissal from the work force he seeks refuge with his sister (Jane Lynch) brother-in-law (Jeff Garlin) and his geeky nephew Matt (Josh Gad) the bassist in a high-school rock band that goes by the regrettable name A.D.D. When the group loses its drummer before a crucial prom-night gig and the eager Fish steps into the void what follows is a life altering moment for all concerned. Mr. Wilsons wild and crazy aging adolescent plays off nicely against the highly disciplined responsible members of A.D.D. who are more than 20 years his junior. Meet Curtis (Teddy Geiger) the groups tormented guitarist/songwriter and Amelia (the very appealing Emma Stone) whose native language is irony. If they dont quite help Fish sober up he does help them lighten up blessedly a point the movie doesnt oversell. And when Fish decides it may be time to play with someone his own age conveniently there is Curtiss attractive former rocker mom played by Christina Applegate. ENLARGE Anna Faris in House Bunny. Columbia Pictures All are served well by a script that observes of one perfect blond specimen ""Its like Abercrombie is making people now"" and that shows a firm understanding of moral relativism. ""Loads of elevators play Celine Dion. That dont make it right."" House Bunny Orphan Shelley Darlingson (Anna Faris) has finally found a loving surrogate family and a home sweet home at the Playboy mansion in the criminally inane comedy ""House Bunny."" Life couldnt be better. All that the curvaceous sweetly pliant Shelley wants for her 27th birthday is an invitation to be the magazines centerfold; what she gets is a brief letter from ""Hef"" (Hugh Hefner playing himself) requesting that she vacate the premises. Mistaken for a prostitute (tee hee) Shelley spends the night in jail where her innocent double entendres crack up the other inmates (tee hee tee hee). Touchingly eager to find a place she can call home she wanders on to a college campus and becomes house mother at Zeta Alpha Zeta a sorority whose members are such a sorry lot its doubtful that even the tide would take them out. Film Clips Watch a scene from ""The Rocker."" Watch a scene from ""House Bunny."" Shelley teaches her charges among them the bespectacled intellectual Natalie (here again Emma Stone) and the heavily pierced heavily scornful Mona (Kat Dennings) how to dress how to apply makeup how to be sexy and most crucially how to be popular. If Zeta fails to attract a new roster of members -- currently there are exactly seven -- it will be forced to disband and the house sold to the snooty conniving sorority down the street. Predictably Shelley herself learns some important lessons for instance that life is about more than being sexy; its about being true to yourself. ""House Bunny"" s ""Legally Blonde"" roots show. Written by the same team responsible for the 2001 hit starring Reese Witherspoon ""Bunny"" offers up a similar theme a similar palette (think pink) and a similar protagonist a supposed bimbo whos been seriously underestimated. Find television listings for Steve Coogan Anna Faris and more at LocateTV. Unfortunately Ms. Faris has neither an adroit script -- ""House Bunny"" is a stale collection of dumb bunny jokes -- nor Ms. Witherspoons wily charm. And the filmmakers do Ms. Faris no favors by inviting comparisons to Marilyn Monroe. A scene of this bunny in a full skirt standing over a hissing manhole cover -- shades of ""The Seven Year Itch"" -- is an embarrassment. All the more so when Ms. Faris gasps ""Who knew steam could be hot?"" Who indeed. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation.

"Rocker has heart as well as its share of metal-headed humor - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Rocker has heart as well as its share of metal-headed humor By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / August 20 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + ""The Rocker"" is a grubby little redemption comedy that in every way feels like a consignment-shop Jack Black vehicle. It wears better on Rainn Wilson the movies ungainly oft-humiliated star. Like Black in ""School of Rock"" Wilson too plays a washed-up musician reborn in the glow of youth. But the tots in that 2003 comedy have been replaced with a trio of nice Cleveland teens whose band needs a drummer. Occasional hilarity ensues.A lot of it comes at Wilsons expense. Hes less combustible than Black but theres a lot more drama in his face that he never unleashes on ""The Office"" where his doofus suck-up Dwight goes about his schemes as deadpan as possible. Wilson is still playing a doofus but hes all over the place here. His character Robert ""Fish"" Fishman used to drum for a hard-rock heavy metal glam outfit called Vesuvius. He was dumped right before the band dominated the world. That was 20 years ago. Now the group is bound for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Fish is freshly fired recently dumped and suddenly living with his sister and brother-in-law (Jane Lynch and Jeff Garlin). Their husky soft-spoken son (Josh Gad) plays keyboards in a wimp-rock band called A.D.D.Fish humiliates the band at the prom after he erupts all over a polite cover of Peter Gabriels ""In Your Eyes"" then turns them famous after a footage of playing nude and sweaty becomes a viral-video hit. The movie certainly knows how the music-industry paradigm has shifted. YouTube is the new Dick Clark and the movie which Peter Cattaneo (""The Full Monty"") directed looks accordingly homemade. Cattaneo does make sure the movies heart is in the right place. There are some nice human trimmings including Christina Applegate who does some decent sparring with Wilson as the mother of one of the kids in the band. After Fish gets A.D.D. arrested she becomes a chaperone.There is of course some vomiting on Wilsons behalf. But ""The Rocker"" is gross by obligation. Wilson seems required to be obnoxious almost because thats what would be expected of Black were he here. Behind the drum kit Wilson comes orgasmically alive. And hes somehow even better imparting life lessons to his much younger costars.The movie is much more persuasive as an overlong work of sensitivity. A.D.D.s frontman is an earnest brooder named Curtis (Teddy Geiger) and his entire songbook appears to be about his missing father (sample lyric ""You should have been here to teach me how to drive""). Its possible the movie which the wife-husband team of Maya Forbes and Wallace Wolodarsky wrote is going for satire of emo earnestness. After the band hits it big A.D.D. releases an album called ""Abandonment Issues."" The movie is too gently performed to draw blood of any kind. Even with its head in the maw of fame there is no suspense about whether the group will survive the resulting tiffs which are best described as ""early reality television.""Geiger Gad and Emma Stone who plays the groups bassist are easily the best things in the movie - so good that they make Wilson seem superfluous. And yet the bands love of Fish is sincere. Theyre not angling for attitudinal hipster shtick (in college perhaps) or know-it-all sarcasm. Theyre just good smart interesting kids playing lame music from the bottom of their hearts.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/ae/movienation.

"The Rocker Hits the right notes | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Rocker Hits the right notesPete Best who appears as himself in a cameo role in The Rocker  is the hero of that saddest of modern legends the story of the nobody who almost became a somebody and then had to be a nobody again.By Philip MarchandMoviesWed. Aug. 20 2008Starring Rainn Wilson Emma Stone Josh Gad Teddy Geiger Christina Applegate Jason Sudeikis. Directed by Peter Cattaneo. 102 minutes. At major theatres. 14APete Best who appears as himself in a cameo role in The Rocker is the hero of that saddest of modern legends the story of the nobody who almost became a somebody and then had to be a nobody again.Best was the original drummer with the Beatles. Dismissed from the band just as they were about to ascend the stratosphere of fame he ended up working in a bread factory. It was a cruel fate and cruel fates always fascinate us. In The Rocker the Pete Best figure is Robert ""Fish"" Fishman (The Offices Rainn Wilson) a drummer in the mid-80s with a Cleveland-based heavy metal band called Vesuvius. The band is approached by its manager with a recording contract that will bring them fame and fortune. Theres only one condition. The son of the record companys owner wants to be the bands drummer. Fish must go.Sure enough we see the band members fleeing in their van from an outraged Fish. Article Continued BelowThe next scene takes place 20 years later with Fish still in Cleveland still obsessed about his lost chance for rock n roll stardom as he toils in a menial job.Its a wonderful premise for a drama that could end in tragedy or perhaps in a spiritual crisis that results in Fishs eventual acceptance of his fate. But this is a comedy so when Fishs nephew asks him to be the drummer in their high school rock band and play at the senior prom we know this is the beginning of an improbable train of events that will give Fish a second chance at that stardom. A rock music insider once observed that the bands that never made it were luckier than the bands that did. The former could still fantasize about living their dream; the latter could only ask themselves in the words of the Peggy Lee anthem ""Is that all there is?"" Thats a plight waiting to be dramatized. But again it would be a different movie. The Rocker is an amiable comedy so efficiently constructed that you can practically see the computer software on how to write comedy screenplays at work. Nonetheless it is an enjoyable construction with Wilson perfecting the crazed look of a man who cant believe either his good luck or his bad fortune. Somehow hes managed to retain a small patch of sanity. More importantly he retains a crucial likeability just this side of being a jerk. We dont want to see a jerk in action for two hours. (How Adam Sandler gets away with it Ill never know.)The other key performer is Teddy Geiger in the role of the guitarist Curtis Woods a hurting teenager with a streak of poetic genius. Theres another dramatic role that has insufferable twit written all over it and yet Geiger has a wounded charisma that makes him very appealing onscreen and helps him carry off the part.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Directed by Peter Cattaneo. With Rainn Wilson Christina Applegate. Opens Wednesday at theaters in New Jersey. THREE STARS We go to movies expecting miracles -- stories that make us look at our lives in a new way transport us to an entirely new world or simply take us out of ourselves for a few hours. But sometimes even a small pleasant surprise can be enough to make us think our ticket money has been well-spent. Like ""The Rocker."" I first noticed this movie coming months ago and frankly began dreading it. The basic story -- a heavy-metal drummer tries to make a comeback after 20 years -- made it sound like one of the moron movies that Will Ferrell regularly turns out. An ever-changing release date didnt build confidence. So admitted my expectations were low. But the movie still nicely exceeded them. The basic story is as advertised and our drummer -- nicknamed ""Fish"" and played by the slightly glassy-eyed Rainn Wilson -- could pass for one of Ferrells clowns (particularly in his propensity for walking around in his underwear -- or less). But theres also a heart to this character and Wilson has a slangy verbosity thats a lot more like Jack Black. In fact as the story develops it feels less like ""Rocker The Legend of Fish"" and more like ""High School of Rock."" Because one day the two-decades-without-a-gig Fish decides to sit in on his nephews garage band. And with a little bit of talent and a lot of luck finds himself -- and his new teen friends -- on the way towards heavy-rotation success. The radio-ready songs and young cast (particularly real-life singer/songwriter Teddy Geiger and Emma Stone -- who looks like a before-the-fall Lindsay Lohan) add some sweetness to the story. Director Peter Cattaneo -- most famous for another second-chance-at-life story ""The Full Monty"" -- keeps things moving brightly around the Midwest. But what gives the film its unexpected appeal are its layers of references. The hair-band pyrotechnics are letter-perfect as are some of the 80s in-jokes (is that really Christina Applegate the slutty daughter of ""Married With Children"" now playing an overprotective mom? And Howard Hesseman of ""W.K.R.P. in Cincinnati"" driving the tour bus?) There are probably too many gags about just how sweaty Fish gets slammin the skins and not enough about the differences between 1988 metal and 2008 emo. All the loose ends -- boy meets girl man meets woman bullies gets theirs -- get tied up a little too neatly too. (The screenwriters have perhaps spent too many decades writing sitcoms.) But if this isnt the laugh riot of the year its still a pleasant surprise particularly for teen audiences. And in comedy seasons like this one thats sometimes more than enough. Ratings note The film contains nudity coarse language violence and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

He managed to be the only annoying element in a tiny role in the otherwise superb ""Juno."" But Wilson channels his inner Jack Black - the similarity in inflections and physical movement is uncanny - to winning effect in ""The Rocker"" which manages to be a notably funnier than average summer comedy despite being a fairly shameless rip-off of ""School of Rock."" PHOTO GALLERY The Rocker MORE Lou Lumenicks Movies Blog Wilson plays Robert ""Fish"" Fishman an unemployed middle-age loser who lives with his disapproving sister (Jane Lynch) her more sympathetic husband (Jeff Garlin) and his nerdy nephew Matt (Josh Gad). Matt cant stand his uncle but turns to him for help when his teenage rock band A.D.D. loses its drummer just before a gig at their high school prom. Back in the 80s Fish was unfairly pushed out of a heavy metal band called Vesuvius whose members became platinum-selling rock superstars. Read a Page Six Magazine feature on Rainn Wilson Fishs reluctant return to performing is less than spectacular but A.D.D. gains notoriety - and an offer to tour - after a video of him practicing naked becomes a staple on the Internet. So Fish and the teenage misanthropes - including punker Amelia (Emma Stone) and unsmiling lead singer Curtis (Teddy Geiger) - begin playing dives with Curtis hottie single mom Kim (Christina Applegate) tagging along as a chaperone/love-hate interest for Fish after they get arrested. As in ""School of Rock"" Fish indoctrinates his young charges in the niceties of the musical genre - the musical parodies are generally on the mark - and also helps with their adolescent issues in a way that helps Fish approach mature adulthood. This familiar scenario works because of well-written and acted characters. The disciplined direction is by Peter Cattaneo who tackled somewhat similar material in ""The Full Monty"" a decade ago. Its not giving anything away to reveal that the film climaxes with A.D.D. performing at a huge venue in Cleveland as the opening act for Vesuvius - whose Brit-accented members seem to have stepped straight out of ""This Is Spinal Tap."" lou.lumenicknypost.com THE ROCKER ""School of Rock"" redux. Running time 102 minutes. Rated PG-13 (drug and sex references nudity profanity). At the Empire the Union Square the Kips Bay.

Elizabeth Weitzman Tuesday August 19 2008 702 PM The Office"" doesnt return to television until Sept. 25 and I know I cant be the only one counting the days. So perhaps the kindest way to look at ""The Rocker"" would be to consider it a placeholder until Rainn Wilson can get back to what he does best.To be fair Wilson works overtime to hold Peter Cattaneos flimsy comedy together. But its pretty dispiriting to see a guy who offers inspired turns on TV week after week wrestling vainly with the subpar material he was given for the big screen. CLICK TO SEE A PHOTO GALLERY OF OTHER MOVIES THAT ROCK.Jammed into a part that Jack Black would have turned down flat Wilson plays Robert (Fish) Fishman a bitter fortysomething who once had a chance at the good life. Back in the 80s he was the drummer for a hair metal band called Vesuvius until the other guys (including Will Arnett and Fred Armisen) unceremoniously kicked him out. Twenty years later theyre filling arenas while hes a miserable office drone who has never grown up. As it turns out immaturity is a characteristic that comes in handy when his nephew (Josh Gad) needs a drummer for his high-school band (which also includes real-life singer Teddy Geiger and ""Superbad"" beauty Emma Stone). Without Fish they cant play the prom which is the best gig theyve ever gotten. But he has far bigger dreams and after an unfortunate incident involving Chinese food nudity and YouTube the band - named A.D.D. - becomes something of a sensation. Before long A.D.D. has the chance to tour ... as long as moms Christina Applegate and Jane Lynch approve. Permissions granted but only if Fish will serve as a responsible role model. You can imagine how that goes. While nobodys expecting ""This Is Spinal Tap"" both the audience and the cast -which is strong all around - deserve better than the generic script and bland direction here.

Tabasco sauce anchovies moonshine John Mayer - the list is long. But somewhere near the top is Rainn Wilson. Yes Wilsons an essential ingredient of NBCs The Office as Dwight the weird unctuous office cop. The show wouldnt be the same without him. Now imagine an entire episode featuring Dwight stretched out to an hour and a half or so. A bit much no? But thats basically what you get with The Rocker a film built around Wilsons idiosyncratic talents. Wilson stars as Robert ""Fish"" Fishman drummer for the metal band Vesuvius. We meet him and his bandmates 20 years ago as theyre on the verge of signing with a label. The only problem A relative of one of the label executives wants to play drums. Which means Fish is bounced. (The bands rapid selling out of Fish is great.) Cut to the present where office drone Fishs co-workers rock out to Vesuvius still. An embittered Fish ends up living with his sister and her family. Soon his nephew Matt (Josh Gad) needs a drummer for his band A.D.D. to play the prom. If only he had a crazy drummer uncle living in the attic . . . oh yeah. The other members Curtis (real-life singer/songwriter Teddy Geiger) and Amelia (Emma Stone who grew up in Scottsdale) doubt its the right move but theyre desperate. The first gig implodes but thanks to Fish practicing naked and the miracle of YouTube soon the whole country is turned on to A.D.D. Labels are interested - Jason Sudeikis is hilarious stealing every scene hes in as unbelievably uncouth label representative David Marshall - and soon the band is on tour. Here The Rocker borrows heavily from The School of Rock with Wilson in the Jack Black role of the supposedly wise music vet whose enthusiasm makes up for all the idiotic advice he doles out. Along the way Fish falls for Curtis mom (Christina Applegate); they bond by playing what else Guitar Hero. (Marshall makes a pass at her too in his own inimitable way.) Mostly though this is about the band becoming a band a real one with Fishs help. Geigers quite good at performing the songs which are much better than usual for this kind of thing. The inevitable face-off with Vesuvius has a couple of satisfying payoffs (one involving accents). And there is one truly inspired cameo though you have to look close to catch it. But how much you ultimately like The Rocker will inevitably depend on how much you like Wilson. And a little goes a long way. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8974.

Photo George Kraychyk Twentieth Century Fox Review Rocker 1 / 2 Back to Gallery For those who miss ""The Gilmore Girls"" you can not only catch Alexis Bedel in ""Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2"" but now you can also revisit one of the former TV series subplots in Peter Cattaneos ""The Rocker."" The opening date of the film was shifted around like the planchette on a Ouija board a sure sign that the studio knew it had one of those ""Hollywood we have a problem"" movies that needed to arrive in theaters in a relatively quiet part of the summer season. You know after people had stopped going to see big blockbusters like ""The Dark Knight"" and trippy Ben Stiller spoofs like ""Tropic Thunder."" As it turns out it doesnt matter that those two films are going gangbusters at the box office ""The Rocker"" isnt really good enough to compete with even moderately successful films. Remember on ""Gilmore Girls"" when Lane defied her Korean-born mother and formed a rock band with a few guys and they all practiced in secret? And then when they needed to fill one of the slots in the band they ended up taking in an older washed-up former rocker dude whod left his hopes in the past but kept his 80s hair? Thats pretty much the plot that ""Rocker"" screenwriters Maya Forbes and Wally Wolosdarsky have defrosted Ryan Jaffes original story as a vehicle for ""The Offices"" winning loser Rainn Wilson. Robert ""Fish"" Fishman is bounced from a metal band called Vesuvius and spends years resenting his former bandmates while failing to find much of a solo career. After getting fired from his latest job he moves into the attic of his sister and brother-in-laws home in Cleveland until his nephew Matts high school garage band finds itself in need of a drummer and Fish signs on. Funniest line of the movie (and believe me the competition isnt stiff) The band is getting ready to play a prom when Fish protests that the headliners never go on until 11 p.m. ""Its prom"" sighs mopey bassist Amelia (Emma Stone). ""Its over at 11."" Unbelievably the band gets a foothold in professional music circles. It has nothing to do with the singing talents of real-life tadpole rocker Teddy Geiger; it has to do with Fishs flabby naked butt and the magic of the real-life Internet. Wilsons character isnt too far removed from his Dwight Schrute on NBCs ""The Office."" Both men are self-important delusional possessed with a terminal Alexander Haig complex insecure lonely and ultimately harmless losers. The only real difference is that Fish Fishman has lost a few more brain cells to drugs and booze over the years than straight-arrow Dwight. The weird thing is that you think you like both men but in fact you like Dwight but you feel sorry for Fish. Hes so obnoxious most of the time you almost cant blame his original bandmates (who include ""Arrested Developments"" Will Arnett) for kicking him to the curb. Of course having proved himself a comic master Wilson could have done something with this role if only the direction werent so uninspired and the screenplay so predictable. Theres more telegraphing going on here than in every Western Hollywood ever churned out. Example Fish steals his sisters van so he can transport the band to its first gig in far-off Indiana and comments on how easy the trip is going to be. Quicker than you can say ""Wait for it"" the inevitable flashing red light and sound of police car sirens. The supporting cast is fine for the most part. Josh Gad is Fishs overweight and underloved nephew and Christina Applegate despite getting second billing only shows up from time to time to make us wonder if an unlikely romance with Fish may be in the offing. There are funny cameos from Arnett Jane Krakowski as Fishs ex-girlfriend and Dr. Johnny Fever a.k.a. Howard Hesseman as a grizzled and vaguely sleazy bus driver. Former KRON reporter SuChin Pak now an MTV personality also has a brief cameo as herself. Geiger gets third billing but has almost as much screen time as Wilson. Hes a sweet kid and a talented singer but as an actor hmm not so much. His monotone and laid-back delivery fit the role of a reticent high school rock n roll heartthrob but if he were ever to play say 19 hed have his work cut out for him. Having made a brief appearance in the equally brief (three episodes) 2006 CBS show ""Love Monkey"" Geiger is trying to balance his Tiger Beat-worthy looks with serious musical chops. This film helps showcase his velvety singing style and easy-on-the-eyes stage presence. It would help further if it convinced Geiger not to quit his day job. You want to like almost everyone in this film but theyre all undone by a weak script that really wasnt worth more than a ""Gilmore Girls"" subplot after all. -- Advisory Contains drug-use references occasional coarse language and partial nudity.

A slight silly comedy in the vein of Jack Blacks School of Rock (but for the earlier film Black might have been in this) The Rocker stars Rainn Wilson as Robert ""Fish"" Fishman a total loser from Cleveland. Well hes a loser now but 20 years ago when he was the drummer of the up-and-coming power band Vesuvius (big hair tight pants inane lyrics) Fish and buddies were on their way. Clubs groupies and the promise of a record deal. Just one problem The record company wanted the band to jettison its drummer. Well two problems The record company said get rid of Fish and his bandmates did. Outta here - and Vesuvius goes on to become as big as Black Sabbath. And Fish goes on to a life of middle-aged gloom and regret. Redemption in The Rocker comes in the form of Fishs nephew a dweeby high schooler by the name of Matt (Josh Gad). His band A.D.D. is playing the prom but its drummer has been grounded. Would Uncle Fish care to take his place? And so reluctantly he does. And then a rehearsal video gets posted on YouTube and the band with the ""Naked Drummer"" - yep that would be Fish - becomes an Internet hit. Written by Maya Forbes and Wally Wolodarsky and directed by Peter Cattaneo (The Full Monty) The Rocker can be amusingly dopey with its Spinal Tap-ish lampooning of rock idioms - and idiots. And the generation gap between Fish and his bandmates (nephew Matt; a sensitive emo guy played by Teddy Geiger; and the ironic post-punkette played by Emma Stone) makes for a few smarty-pants jokes. But while Wilson mugs and broods purses his lips and puffs his chest the character actor - the strange Dwight Schrute of TVs The Office the even stranger Arthur on HBOs Six Feet Under - doesnt have the heft to carry an entire film. Jack Blacks fearless foolish ferocity is missing. With a flimsy kind of romance going on between Fish and an A.D.D. kids mom (Christina Applegate) the film takes to the tour bus for the bands inaugural road trip and for an inevitable crossing-of-the-paths with Fishs ex-mates in the still mega-huge Vesuvius. The Rocker makes use of Clevelands landmark Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. And Pete Best the real-life drummer who was kicked out of a band just before it broke big - an outfit called the Beatles - makes a cameo as himself. Which can be interpreted as ironic or pathetic depending on your mood.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Forty-something wannabe rock star worms his way into his teenage nephews band. How many times do you think Will Ferrell and Jack Black have turned down that pitch? Im guessing approximately eleventy billion. Rainn Wilson (of TVs ""The Office"") cant afford to be so choosy. Playing a paunchy workaday drone chasing one last shot at rock n roll glory is the kind of dues you gotta pay when youre working your way up from cameo player to feature film star. Not that ""The Rocker"" is a major feature. Lightweight as cotton candy and nearly as beneficial for your brain it is a banal concoction of hair-band gags and unconvincing romantic comedy. Wilson plays ""Fish"" Fishman a has-been drummer from Vesuvius an 80s rock band that dumped him the very day it hit the big time. (Metallicas lawyers take note.) Fish has been nursing his grudge for two decades and when a co-worker raves about the group and plays a track from their latest smash album he runs amok. Dominoes fall as he gets fired loses his girlfriend and moves in with his sisters family in Cleveland where the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame seems to mock him from every shot. Wouldnt you know that his loser nephews high school band lost its drummer right before the prom? Who could possibly fill in on such short notice? Through an inexcusably dumb chain of events the band becomes a YouTube sensation and goes on tour. Christina Applegate playing the guitarists hot momma tags along as the youngsters chaperone and Wilsons unlikely love interest. And so things begin looking up for our protagonist. If only some sort of battle of the bands could bring Fish and friends up against his old antagonists on Vesuvius what a fitting climax that would be But of course such a thing could never happen. THE ROCKER  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for drug and sexual references nudity and language. ""The Rockers"" screenplay (by the husband-and-wife team of Maya Forbes of ""The Larry Sanders Show"" and former ""Simpsons"" writer Wally Wolodarsky) holds some interest as a storehouse of used comedy ideas. Repeated head-bangings? Check. Paunchy pale guy wearing tighty whities? Check. Adult man-child behaving in age-inappropriate ways? Double check. This film is just another hairball clog in the seasonal glut of dumb comedies. Peter Cattaneo director of the warmhearted ""The Full Monty"" fumbles here opting for the broad lazy satire of stereotypes rather than creating only a couple of carefully individualized characters. Wilson is all over the map Jane Lynch is stiff and stern as his disapproving sister. The film is a better showcase for Jeff Garlin (currently heard as the Captain in ""WallE"") who shines as Wilsons sympathetic brother-in-law and Emma Stone (""Superbad"") as the bands wry rebellious bassist. With her eyes screaming ""youve got to be kidding me"" in every scene shes a hilarious representation of teen exasperation. But two great cuts dont make an album and two fine supporting performances dont make ""The Rocker"" worthwhile.

SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Its never too late to rock. Thats why audiences would be better served staying home and playing Rock Band than wasting their time on something as leaden and unfunny as The Rocker ( 1/2 out of four). If a viable rock n roll comedy is what youre looking for find a copy of This Is Spinal Tap or School of Rock. If youre a Rainn Wilson fan catch a rerun of TheOffice. Just dont waste your time seeing something as derivative predictable and humor-free as The Rocker. Its hard not to have some hope for this movie given its strong cast. And its almost impossible to understand how Peter Cattaneo directed something so tired and humorless after The Full Monty. Wilson plays Robert ""Fish"" Fishman the former drummer for Vesuvius an 80s hair band. The leather-clad power rockers oust him just as theyre about to become a major act. Fish goes from living his dream to a nightmarish existence as a disillusioned office drone. But hes no ambitious wannabe like The Offices insufferable Dwight Schrute. Decades pass and Fish remains haunted by Vesuvius continued success. His bitterness finally erupts and he loses his dull desk job. When he learns his nephews band A.D.D. needs a drummer Fish prods the youthful band members to take him on. A YouTube-like video taken while hes practicing his drums in the nude causes a sensation and he becomes known as the Naked Drummer. His nude scenes are more cringe-worthy than funny but the gimmick catapults A.D.D. into an MTV sensation and the fledgling band goes on tour. Fish 41 is ready to party while his teenage bandmates prefer a good nights sleep. What role-reversal hilarity. Wilson is a talented comedian who has a much better movie in him. Christina Applegate playing the mother of one of the adolescent bandmates was much better in Anchorman. Not surprisingly the project was developed by Shawn Levy who directed two of the least funny and most formulaic movies in recent memory Night at the Museum and Cheaper by the Dozen. The Rocker cant decide whether its a film about a lovable loser having a midlife crisis a racier comedy about a multi-generation rock band or a heartwarming look at second chances. The way it fuses these three cliched genres is as off-putting as listening to incessant feedback. (Rated PG-13 for drug and sexual references nudity and language. Running time 1 hour 45 minutes.

The film opens in Cleveland mid-1980s where Rainn Wilsons Robert ""Fish"" Fishman is behind the kit for Vesuvius a metal band fronted by three head-bobbing hair-waving morons (Will Arnett Fred Armisen and Bradley Cooper) whose loyalty only extends to the dotted line. Told to either ditch their drummer or lose a deal with a record label his bandmates choose the former sending Fish into a tailspin from which he never recovers. Until decades later that is when he falls in with A.D.D. the high-school band for which his portly pale nephew (Josh Gad) plays keyboard. Fish wins over the sulking songwriting frontman (Teddy Geiger) and the brooding scowling guitarist (Emma Stone) and theyre signed and touring and sell-out famous within hours of making their inauspicious Interwebs debut. Sooner or later theyre forced to choose between opening for Vesuvius or busting up the band. A juvenile fairy tale that plays like the pilot for a Jonas Brothers sitcom on the Disney Channel The Rocker comes off as something penned by an old dude who hasnt bought music since it was sold ""on records"" or ever met a music executive who wasnt a character in This Is Spinal Tap. This is sugary-sweet stuff--pop instead of rock.

Plus The Rocker never quite rocks. By David Edelstein Published Aug 15 2008 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Zeitgeist Films) Kimberly Roberts lost her mother to AIDS when she was 13; lived on the street; sold cocaine; straightened out her life; married an addict (now clean) whose face shed slashed with a razor blade; wrote vivid rap songs about all shed survived; and wound up residing in New Orleans predominantly African-American Ninth Wardwhere on August 29 2005 she turned her camcorder on marooned friends and relatives when Katrina smashed into the city and the levees buckled. Her shaky footage is the centerpiece of Tia Lessin and Carl Deals Trouble the Water and seen through her eyesthose of a person whod gone from chaos and nihilism to faiththe catastrophe and the impulse to document it seems especially heroic. As her family huddles in an attic with a view of the water rushing through the streets higher than the stop signs pouring into houses of people fighting the current to keep from going under with 911 operators telling her theres no one coming to the rescue at this time the film is at once infuriating and affirming. No matter how bland the bureaucratese in the disasters aftermath what happened to Kimberly Roberts and her husband Scott and her drowned uncle and her hospitalized grandmother left to die is right there on the screenalways in the present tense. Lessin and Deal met Kimberly and Scott after the couple had managed to make it to safety and the film theyve woven around her first-person footage provides the bitter political context the mayor unconcerned as the storm approaches about the lack of public transportation; the dissembling president (I dont think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees); the stunned FEMA appointee heckuva-job Michael Brown. There is simply no one from the government there as the water rises and those who areofficers at a naval base blocks awaytrain their guns on a crowd in desperate search of shelter. The filmmakers cut back and forth between those last days of August and the couples return two weeks later to their devastated neighborhood where they find a decomposing relative and amid carcasses of dogs their own pets alive and frisky and destined to be shot by National Guardsmen for reasons unspecified. The Robertses ruminate bitterly on a country that directs its vast resources elsewhereto Iraq for examplebut always end their exchanges with praise for the soldiers good works and thanks to God. As someone of bounteous hope but little (formal) faith I found Kimberlys religious ejaculations a bit trying. She and her husband trek north to a relatives house in which theres no water and when a man shows up to turn it on she exclaims When you trust in God he sends miracles your way Five minutes later the man returns now ordered to shut the water off and this time God goes pointedly unmentioned. But I admit that my perspective is that of a privileged New Yorker who has never had to summon comparable spiritual resources. Whatever sparked and has sustained Kimberlys resolve is indeed a kind of miracle. The rap that she performs for the camera Amazing is just that an explicit (and profane) account of her sordid past capped with an irresistibly upbeat refraina potential smash. That faith brings her and her husband back to New Orleans despite continued government neglecteven as New Orleans pours its resources into luring tourists back to the French Quarter. In one scene Kimberly and fellow refugees line up for FEMA assistance at some kind of ranch where a sign overhead points to Gate BCATTLE ENTRANCE. You cant make this stuff up. You can however capture it on film for all time. Trouble the Water is ineradicably moving. Why cant Americans make comedies as playful but serious as Jiri Menzels I Served the King of England (opening August 29) based on a book by the great Czech satirist Bohumil Hrabal? Is it because we cant stand the thought of a hero who is at once indifferent to politics and entirely shaped by them? Jan Ditte (Oldrich Kaiser) emerges from a Czech prison after nearly fifteen years and is exiled to an abandoned villageonce occupied by Germanson the border. As he mulls over his life we see flashbacks of him as a slight Chaplinesque fellow (Ivan Barnev) who wants only to be rich and manages to accommodate himself to all sorts of peoplegenerals kings industrialists and eventually the invading Nazis. The flashbacks are in the style of silent comedy their magical naivete at odds with Dittes cynical view of human nature and the encroaching horror of Nazism. Menzels touch is sprightly lyrical mischievously understatedhis hero neither good nor evil but blessed (and cursed) by tunnel vision. How could he have guessed what the Commies would make of his wealthor that bad luck would be his redemption? Most mainstream American comedies these days are satires not of real life but of film genrestwo giant steps removed from the world. The newest specimens Hamlet 2 and The Rocker are decent late-August time killers made inconsequential by their facetiousness. The first is a fable of a failed actor (Steve Coogan) who becomes a failed high-school drama teacher and has his faith restored by a class of (initially) uncooperative ethnic minoritiesa parody of Dangerous Minds. Ive always had a soft spot for Andrew Fleming (Dick) whose rhythms are less pushy than other American comedy directors sometimes winningly sometimes to the point of flaccidity. This one is on the limp side but gets points for weirdness. Coogans mopiness is oddly riveting. And the inspirational climax a musical extravaganza in which Hamlet goes through a portal in time and joins forces with Jesus is so god-awful it is very nearly inspired. With a half-decent climax the go-for-it parody The Rocker would have been pretty good bordering on good instead of just okay. Its appeal rests on Rainn Wilson of NBCs The Office a large misshapen fellow whose features swim in the middle of his big face and whose movements are the opposite of fluid. He plays Fish a drummer unjustly chucked out of a heavy-metal band that went on to superstardom who now has another shot with a group of high-school kids. I liked a lot of The Rocker (Christina Applegate as the mother of the groups lead singer is blessedly grounded) but its depressing when the best thing you can say about a comedy is that its second-rateness is pleasantly in sync with its unmagnetic hero.

I still recall wincing through 1994s Airheads (remember Brendan Fraser Steve Buscemi and Adam Sandler -- billed third -- in their hair-metal wigs?) and The Rocker with Rainn Wilson as a metal drummer from the 80s who just missed out on stardom is a similar oil slick of ""rebellious"" sitcom attitude. The only brazen thing about the film is how shamelessly it rips off School of Rock recycling its flaky-educator loser-of-the-gods premise only this time in high school. Wilsons ""Fish"" Fishman who got tossed out of his band in 1986 (just before they made it big) is now an anonymous never-was who agrees to drum in his teenage nephews band; theyre a brainy crew of freaks and geeks and he sets about teaching them the Spirit of Rock amp; Roll. Jack Black made School of Rock great because he was an authentic embodiment of that spirit and a walking air-guitar doofus. But Rainn Wilson has no wild-child demons no inner rock star; hes a guy who belongs in an office cubicle. (Hes like the rogue son of Garrison Keillor.) The fifth or sixth time you hear him wrap his all-too-sane and innocuous delivery around a line like ""Im going to be responsible all right -- for partying till my nuts catch fire"" you want to shout Enough already Let his nuts catch fire Maybe then hell surprise us.

While Rainn Wilson handles cubicle work with aplomb on TVs ""The Office"" hes also right at home onstage in ""The Rocker"" playing a heavy-metal burnout who gets a second shot at stardom -- never mind that success comes 20 years too late drumming at his nephews high school prom. Its the kind of role ready-made for Jack Black (had ""School of Rock"" not happened) and Wilson makes the most of it in this well-crafted feel-good satire. With the right word of mouth Fox could have a modest hit with the Aug. 20 release. For those who loved ""The Full Monty"" ""The Rocker"" also marks a return to form for director Peter Cattaneo tapping into the same winsome risk-everything spirit that defined the 1997 hit. Working with ""Seeing Other People"" scribes Maya Forbes and Wallace Wolodarsky Cattaneo puts character first Wilsons Robert Fishman or ""Fish"" to his friends may be an outrageous fortysomething man-child but hes not a character you grow tired of by the second act. Two decades after his heavy-metal bandmates sold him out for a record contract the former drummer still prickles at the very mention of his band Vesuvius. The other members are on the brink of being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame while hes stuck answering phones at a dead-end desk job with nothing more than his ponytail and sideburns left to suggest his more flamboyant stage presence. Fired from work and forced to move back in with his sister (Jane Lynch) and their family Fish reluctantly agrees to join the band of her awkward teen son (Josh Gad) and his outcast friends (emo-eyed Teddy Geiger and ""Superbads"" Emma Stone) who perform mopey pop ballads under the name ADD. No sooner is Fish back at the kit than hes stealing the show turning a slow-dance rendition of Peter Gabriels ""In Your Eyes"" into a rafter-rattling drum solo. The band is appalled (it doesnt help that Fish hits on the lead singers mom played by Christina Applegate) but his enthusiasm is contagious and theyre soon practicing together via webcam. Not quite familiar with the technology Fish jams in the nude a sight that inevitably makes its way onto YouTube attracting a shady manager (Jason Sudeikis) eager to rep ""the Naked Drummer."" The band takes off (a commentary of sorts on the tween-driven state of the music biz) and with ADD and Vesuvius on the same label its only a matter of time before Fish has to face the musicians who betrayed him (played by Will Arnett Fred Armisen and Bradley Cooper). Fishs arc unfolds more or less according to formula with even the smallest subplots playing out as expected but the material cuts together; in other words auds neednt be stoned or drunk to appreciate a comedy that troubles to provide some old-fashioned structure. But the cast still has room to riff and with this inspired performance Wilsons comic persona is truly taking shape. As in ""The Office"" he plays the self-righteous buffoon with each belligerent outburst making his character seem an even bigger fool. The weak link is the films music which is neither funny nor particularly memorable. Its easy enough to parody Fishs hair-metal roots but its hard to imagine someone who quips ""Loads of elevators play Celine Dion -- that doesnt make it right"" getting his fix drumming such vanilla tunes. (The recent indie air-drum parody ""Adventures of Power"" may not have this pics polish but it does understand the instrument better.) Seamless Toronto-for-Cleveland production design and crisp visuals from lenser Anthony B. Richmond complement Cattaneos efficient direction. Instead of feeling like a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch that overstays its welcome the entire operation has a certain momentum growing steadily to the climactic burst of Europes ""The Final Countdown"" -- a rock anthem the likes of which these characters could never touch.

"Rocker The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rocker-the ) Rocker The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli What if they made a Jack Black movie and Jack Black didnt show up? Thats sort of the feeling I get with The Rocker although truth be told Rainn Wilson does an admirable Black impersonation. This warmed-over recycled stew brings the ""comeback"" concept so favored by sports movies into the rock-and-roll arena. Its pure formula devoid of any creative impulses and perhaps most damningly the moments of genuine humor are too few and far between to be worth mentioning. For every clever line or amusing sight gag there are fifteen minutes of lame dialogue and lamer plotting. The Rocker is more disappointing than it is outright bad. One expects something a little fresher from Wilson. Back in the 80s Fish (Wilson) is the member of the heavy metal band Vesuvius who is left behind when the group hits the big time. After jettisoning their drummer Vesuvius becomes a chart-topping sensation and Fish ends up working at a call center and frothing at the mouth whenever anyone mentions the ""V"" word. 20 years later Fish is granted a second chance when the garage band ADD needs a drummer for a prom gig. The band comprised of teenagers comes to Fish only as a last resort. He initially refuses but his nephew Matt (Josh Gad) the groups keyboardist sends him on a guilt trip that gets him behind the drums. The other two members of ADD are the guitarist Amelia (Emma Stone) and the angst-ridden singer/songwriter Curtis (Teddy Geiger). The prom performance is a disaster because Fish loses control but a freak YouTube video featuring him drumming in the nude goes viral. Suddenly Fish and ADD have a chance at a breakthrough. Everything you expect to happen in this movie happens. It is assembled from stock parts taken off the script-by-numbers storeroom shelf. Fish the biggest bozo in the world at the beginning of the movie has turned into a loveable clown by the end. He gets his revenge on the guys from Vesuvius. Theres a half-baked romance between Fish and Curtiss hot mother Kim (Christina Applegate). Curtis and Amelia find each other and Matt hooks up with a cute fan. ADD has a ""family spat"" but its resolved relatively cleanly. Am I giving too much away? Not really. The storyline is so derivative its not necessary to see the movie to predict everything that will happen. Rainn Wilson is a funny enough guy in his own right so its a mystery why hes channeling Jack Black for the majority of the movie. Maybe he just finished watching School of Rock or Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny. Wilsons biggest laugh comes as a result of his baring his buttocks while drumming. The films comic timing is consistently off although this could be as attributable to director Peter Cattaneo as to Wilson. Despite getting second billing Christina Applegate barely registers. Kim is the definition of an unnecessary character shoehorned in to give Fish a love interest and provide an adult female role. The actors playing the three younger members of the band are okay although Emma Stone bears a remarkable resemblance to Linsday Lohan. The film sets itself up for a fall in its opening moments when the first appearance of Vesuvius recalls Spinal Tap. For a movie as satirically weak as The Rocker prompting viewers to remember the incisive and hilarious This Is Spinal Tap is not a good thing. Triggering an association with a vastly superior motion picture is a bad move even if it is done inadvertently. Then theres the music. The Rocker provides us with a stack of lifeless canned heavy metal ""originals"" and expects us to believe were hearing works of genius. Or maybe this is a subtle commentary about how easily pop culture adopts crap and anoints it as fresh and original. Unfortunately theres nothing in the tone or approach of The Rocker to indicate such a subtext is reasonable. Movies like The Rocker which are a dime a dozen get pushed into the late summer because they have no chance of surviving in a more competitive environment. Frankly this one shouldnt thrive in any environment. This is pre-packaged entertainment a product designed to give bored teenagers something to watch on a Friday or Saturday night when steamy summer nights are getting longer and Labor Day is just around the corner. Its only other value will be when it shows up on cable in a year and offers respite for insomniacs.
