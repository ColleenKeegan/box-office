Peter Mountain/Paramount Classics hide caption toggle caption Peter Mountain/Paramount Classics Angelina Jolie gives an admirably restrained performance as Mariane Pearl in A Mighty Heart. Peter Mountain/Paramount Classics Director Michael WinterbottomGenre DramaRunning Time 100 minutes (requires RealPlayer) The tragic story of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl slain by terrorists in Pakistan becomes a tense involving police procedural in indie director Michael Winterbottoms first studio film. Having proved in such docudramas as Road to Guantanamo and Welcome to Sarajevo that hes good at organizing masses of information into a coherent storyline Winterbottom builds the film slowly heading down blind alleys and following false leads just as investigators did all the while avoiding sensationalism. Figures weigh in on all sides -- Pakistani bureaucrats sheiks CIA operatives journalists -- many with political agendas of their own while Pearls pregnant wife Mariane (an admirably subdued Angelina Jolie) tries to keep the focus on getting her husband back. Oddly knowing how this harrowing story played out in real life doesnt diminish its power in the slightest.

"Heart and soul | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesHeart and soulThe barbaric kidnapping and slaying of journalist Daniel Pearl was a gross act of exploitation. Islamic terrorists used Pearl an American Jew who had done them no wrong to show the world their hatred of the U.S. and Israel.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 22 2007 Starring Angelina Jolie Dan Futterman Archie Panjabi Irfan Khan and Will Patton. Directed by Michael Winterbottom. At major theatres. 14A  The barbaric kidnapping and slaying of journalist Daniel Pearl was a gross act of exploitation. Islamic terrorists used Pearl an American Jew who had done them no wrong to show the world their hatred of the U.S. and Israel.Article Continued BelowIt is to the considerable credit to the makers of A Mighty Heart a film based on the widow Mariane Pearls published account of the 2002 tragedy that they have not compounded the exploitation by turning it into Hollywood melodrama.With Angelina Jolie starring as Mariane Pearl and her partner Brad Pitt producing the potential for celebrity misstep was there. Yet the duo working in concert with Mariane have acquitted themselves admirably. First by choosing a reliable director in Michael Winterbottom and then in the case of Jolies acting by delivering a dignified performance that seeks wisdom rather than sensationalism.How easy it would have been to take advantage of a story this ripe with intrigue and emotion. Pearl the South Asia Bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal and his pregnant wife Mariane also a journalist were the epitome of globetrotting reporters. In January 2002 they travelled to Karachi Pakistan in search of a story about attempted shoe bomber Richard Reid. Daniel - known as ""Danny"" outside of his byline -had been promised an exclusive interview with Sheikh Mubarik Ali Gilani a Pakistani cleric with links to militant Islamists. Instead Pearl was abducted and later beheaded by Islamic fascists who videotaped his death for Internet broadcast and maximum terror potential.The hunt for Pearl and its tragic resolution are the main concerns of Winterbottom whose fearless pursuit of the truth has been demonstrated in such docudramas as The Road to Guantanamo and Welcome to Sarajevo. He shows the capture of Pearl who is spookily portrayed by look-alike Dan Futterman but he does not attempt to reconstruct the journalists last days - and that includes the horrific murder.Winterbottom opts instead for the procedural approach of a seasoned documentarian filming on location as much as possible and using handheld cameras to track the frantic hunt for Danny launched by Mariane and her journalist friend Asra Nomani (Bend It Like Beckhams Archie Panjabi).As hours become days his disappearance turns into an international incident. Pakistani officials embarrassed by the case try to blame it on Indian terrorists. But they assign the case to their new anti-terror chief a man named Captain (Bollywood star Irfan Khan of The Namesake). He pursues suspects with vigour and little mercy as U.S. Embassy official Randall Bennett (Will Patton) looks on envious of the Captains brutal efficiency.All the while Mariane Pearl attempts to maintain composure while dampening the fires of hatred and revenge. She seeks only to get Danny back; she isnt trying to settle scores. She is reluctant to make him seem either a martyr or a unique victim - she notes that people everywhere are suffering in the global conflicts that 9/11 made globally apparent.Jolies measured approach to portraying Mariane is worthy of Best Actress consideration come awards time. Even in the films most dramatic moment when news of Dannys murder hit home Jolies explosion of grief never registers as false or forced.The understandable desire not to sensationalize the situation may have inadvertently caused the one serious flaw of A Mighty Heart. Winterbottom provides precious little insight into Danny who by all accounts was a fine reporter and man of keen wit and intelligence. We see Danny and Mariane together only at the start of the film and in brief flashbacks. The strength of his heart is never truly revealed.It is only hinted at in the devotion of Mariane to a husband and father-to-be of whom she tells the press ""I have never seen anyone so honest."" Honesty and courage are the main virtues of A Mighty Heart which strives to shed light on dark times. Central to it is Jolies laudable performance of Mariane Pearl as a woman of resolve who watches her world collapse yet who still has the strength to defiantly say ""I am not terrorized.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The deaths at the World Trade Center left us with indelible images of mass destruction but the victims of 9/11 were essentially anonymous. Even today we dont know much about most of them. About Pearl however we quickly came to know a great deal a principled and hard-driving journalist loving husband happily expectant father. He was by all accounts a good man. Perhaps too good for his own good in that he innocently failed to take minimal precautions when he set forth to interview a terrorist he thought might have new information about Richard Reid the infamous ""shoe bomber."" A Mighty Heart based on the book Pearls wife Mariane wrote about the huge and increasing desperate attempt to find Pearl before his kidnappers assassinated him is a conscientious and in many respects admirable account of this effort. Directed by Michael Winterbottom (Welcome to Sarajevo A Cock and Bull Story) in the semi-documentary manner he favors -- hand-held cameras lightly rehearsed staging considerable improvised dialogue -- it has great immediacy and it tells a complex story very coherently. A bewildering number of institutions -- Pakistani security forces the American consulate in Karachi Pearls newspaper even the FBI -- turned the Pearl home into a command center from which they pursued any number of leads both frustrating and promising generally in an optimistic and cooperative spirit. This effort was coordinated by Mariane herself and Angelina Jolie is wonderful in the part. Visibly pregnant surrendering to despair only in private sometimes angry but usually upbeat and commonsensical we gain an extraordinary sense of a woman hiding her vulnerability her essential aloneness at the center of the storm beneath a consistently positive manner. This woman is never seemingly out of control. How difficult that must have been is underscored by Winterbottoms portrayal of Karachi. The word ""teeming"" does not begin to describe this huge and jumbled urban mass this warren of narrow traffic-clogged streets. Who is a friend? Who is an enemy? Who is corruptible who is not? The idea of finding a kidnapped man in that environment seems to us hopeless. As alas it turns out to be. It also turns out to be the insuperable problem A Mighty Heart cannot solve. If this were a fictional film in which the possibility of rescue remains alive until the end the possibilities for suspense would be endless and ever-tightening. But the sad fact is that we know Danny Pearls fate before we enter the theater. Fascinating as these characters are interesting as the events of its chase often are we cannot escape the fact that the movies ending is known to us that historys course cannot be altered. We can (and do) admire Marianes courage the patient tenacity of the ""The Captain"" (Irrfan Khan) the lead Pakistani investigator the sweetness of Dan Futtermans portrayal of Danny Pearl. But what we have in essence is a kind of police procedural in which the procedures do not bear fruit. Or at least not the fruit we desperately want which is the victims safe return. Ironically Dannys murderers were eventually found tried and punished; although we can take muted pleasure in that fact it does not really satisfy us. We can as well admire his widow carrying on building a new life which includes creation of a foundation that seeks to protect endangered journalists everywhere (some 250 of them have lost their lives in action since Pearls death). But again that cannot quite compensate us for our disappointment in this earnest well-made consistently interesting chronicle of death we know to be foretold. A degree of guilt shadows that judgment. One seems to be calling for mere narrative satisfaction from a film that has more serious matters on its mind. But this movie does not fully separate itself from our admittedly low -- even slightly shameful -- expectations does not become the pure documentary it might perhaps better have been.

"A wifes courage - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeA wifes courageANGELINA JOLIE CAPTURES HEART AND DETERMINATION OF MARIANE PEARLBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 06/21/2007 033351 PM PDTUpdated 06/21/2007 035913 PM PDTThe subtitle of Mariane Pearls memoir about the kidnapping and murder of her husband - ""The Brave Life and Death of My Husband Danny Pearl"" - would surely come as a surprise to anyone who sees only the film adaptation of her book ""A Mighty Heart"" in which Angelina Jolie plays Mariane. Such is the force of Jolies performance and the blinding effect of Hollywood star power that the mighty heart of the story has been transformed from his to hers. Jolie wears Marianes determination her fierce French indignation and her cool calculation on the sleeve of her hijab in full view of a houseful of Pakistani policemen who show up soon after her husband disappears. Daniel Pearl then the Wall Street Journals South Asia bureau chief had come to Karachi in pursuit of a story about shoe bomber Richard Reid who had been arrested a month earlier for trying to blow up a passenger jet. Pearl (played by Dan Futterman) is following a lead from a shadowy informant named Bashir (Alyy Khan) when he goes missing. Like many foreign correspondents Pearl works the frontier between outrageous risk and reward so when Mariane - herself a seasoned reporter - sets out to find him she is told by people who dont appear to mean a word theyre saying that he will be fine. Dont worry about a thing. Most of ""A Mighty Heart"" is taken up with Marianes struggle to keep her husband alive and for nearly two hours Jolie does this with a performance at once as subtle and ferocious as any in recent memory.Advertisement With the year now half over can it possi bly be too early to unblushingly nominate her for an Oscar? Director Michael Winterbottom has given his film the look and sense of urgency of a documentary. This undoubtedly isnt as easy as Winterbottom makes it seem because Danny Pearls disappearance was followed by five agonizing weeks of waiting. Shooting in what often appears to be available light and with a handheld camera that he has tamed sufficiently to prevent motion sickness Winterbottom keeps the picture moving along like a thriller. He also manages to maintain a degree of suspense about Pearls fate even though the story made headlines around the world in 2002. Daniel Pearls abduction and brutal execution by terrorists - a videotape revealed he was beheaded by his captors - marked a turning point in the global drama that was set in motion on Sept. 11 2001. Mariane Pearl had become pregnant at almost the same time the terrorists struck on Sept. 11 and was nearly six months pregnant when her husband vanished into the slums of the worlds second-most populous city. Through Jolie she maintains a steely equanimity during the crisis. Following an interview on CNN in which she talks about her missing husband without obvious emotion someone observes how well she has ""held herself together"" a remark which has about it a faint whiff of disapproval A more obviously loving wife might have cried. The investigation is conducted by a newly formed Pakistani counterterrorism unit led by a taciturn cop called Captain (the Indian star Irrfan Khan). When Mariane later approaches the American embassy for help it appears for a time that the Pakistanis may be shown up as bumblers. And in fact one government official declines to assist in the search because he believes the kidnapping is a plot cooked up by Indias intelligence agency to embarrass Pakistan. The film uses actual news footage from the event sparingly and always in ways that not only heighten the feeling that these terrible events did happen but that they are happening again right before our eyes. When the kidnappers send word that Danny Pearls treatment will be no better than the terrorist prisoners at Guanta`namo Bay - Americas own Devils Island - then-Secretary of State Colin Powell is shown insisting that the detainees at Gitmo are being treated humanely. (Just this month Powell seemed to have reversed field and said that the prison should be closed down immediately.) Winterbottom does a wonderful job of showing the tumult and teem of the Karachi streets the density of the chaos that any investigator would have to peer through to find the missing American. Like the team that is chasing Danny Pearl we get only glimpses of him bound and with a gun to his head. Writer John Orloff uses brief flashbacks of Danny and Mariane to give us some sense of who he was. But as ""A Mighty Heart"" continues pulsating in real time Danny begins to feel like a construct more than a person remaining as elusive on screen as he does in captivity. This is Marianes story and no matter how hard she tries to hold him close she can feel her husband slipping away. When Mariane reveals to the Captain that Danny is Jewish you can see his shoulders slump slightly and her spine stiffen. The exchange is almost imperceptible and it passes in an instant but Jolie and Khan manage to make it say everything about Dannys chances. Jolies work as an actress often has been a captive of her celebrity making it difficult to see past her pillowy lips to the craft. Perhaps it took the constraints of docu-drama to uncage her less-obvious gifts but this is her finest performance and likely to be the equal of any given by an actress this year.

Starring Angelina Jolie Dan Futterman and Irfan Khan. Directed by Michael Winterbottom. (R. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The table is set for eight at a dinner party in Karachi Pakistan. But near the beginning of ""A Mighty Heart"" when friends gather for a Cuban feast prepared by journalist Mariane Pearl (Angelina Jolie) one seat remains empty. The camera quickly pans over it; blink and youll miss the shot. This heart-wrenching film is about the man who didnt come to dinner Marianes husband Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl (Dan Futterman) and the horrific circumstances that keep him away. That a story whose ending is widely known -- Pearl was kidnapped and beheaded by Islamic insurgents in 2002 -- still manages to be utterly gripping is due to a buildup of tense small moments such as pals laughing over a hearty meal oblivious to Marianes anxious looks as the hour grows late. Jolie proves her acting mettle by transforming herself into a distraught wife who is six months pregnant when Pearl disappears while chasing a lead on the failed shoe bomb terrorist. Its not just her mass of curly hair mulatto skin hue (Mariane is of Afro-Cuban and Dutch descent) and French accent that make you forget youre looking at the paparazzis current darling. Jolie inhabits the role her penetrating eyes and body language reflecting Marianes terror and helplessness as the situation escalates. When her husbands captors reveal their demands for his release the house where shes staying becomes overrun by diplomatic security the FBI and local authorities. Irfan Khan (the father in ""The Namesake"") gives a quietly powerful performance as head of Pakistani counter-terrorism definitely somebody not to be messed with. Jolie is especially touching in silent scenes of Mariane retreating to bed to shut out the commotion curling up on her side of the bed as if expecting her husband to return at any moment. She also compulsively calls Dannys cell phone long after theres any hope of him picking up. Good for Jolie and her fellow Brad Pitt one of the producers for using their fame to bring Mariane Pearls memoir ""A Mighty Heart The Brave Life and Death of My Husband Danny Pearl"" to the screen. A feel-good movie the swiftest kind to sell it is not. Yet it is suffused with love which makes watching far from an ordeal. Versatile director Michael Winterbottom (""24 Hour Party People"" ""The Claim"") senses when audiences have had enough of misguided attempts to track down Pearl and of the congested streets of Karachi where violence might erupt at any moment and interjects amusing moments of the brass cutting off neighbors phones to get more lines into Marianes house and stealing the American consulates chef to entice the mom-to-be to eat more. Flashbacks of the Pearls falling in love and their storybook wedding suffer from too much glow -- were they really always this lovey-dovey? -- but are a welcome diversion anyway. Futtermans physical resemblance to Pearl is initially unsettling. But the actor uses it to create a sense of getting to know this courageous journalist and devoted husband who couldnt contain his eagerness over becoming a father. Winterbottom and screenwriter John Orloff wisely keep the focus on Mariane and what she witnessed instead of speculating on the kidnapping plot (the full details of which are still muddled). Orloffs script is commendably easy to follow considering that the terrorists motivation keeps shifting. The director is drawn to showing the collateral damage of war. He made ""In This World"" a touching feature of Afghan war refugees as well as the scorching docudrama ""The Road to Guantanamo"" about prisoners held there without being charged. Much of ""A Mighty Heart"" plays like a documentary. It feels truthful instead of puffed up to be more commercial. But Winterbottom also knows just how far to go. Audiences are spared a re-enactment of the video Pearls captors made of his murder. Mariane is told only that ""Danny didnt make it."" The reporter in her wont be satisfied with that resulting in a scene sure to break the mightiest of hearts. -- Advisory Violence and disturbing images.

Friday June 22 2007 400 AM A Mighty Heart Docudrama about the search for kidnapped Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in Pakistan. With Angelina Jolie Dan Futterman. Director Michael Winterbottom (140). R Language. At area theaters. Though the events recalled in Michael Winterbottoms riveting docudrama ""A Mighty Heart"" are well-known they are dramatized with such realistic detail and heartfelt passion that the story feels as urgent as the latest bad news out of the Middle East. Its the story of Daniel Pearl the ill-fated Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped on assignment in Karachi in early 2002 and used by his captors in a cruel and clumsy effort to force the release of Pakistani prisoners at Guantanamo. Winterbottom whose past docudramas ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" and ""The Road to Guantanamo"" made him the perfect choice to direct had some serious logistical problems to overcome in dramatizing events that were largely dependent on traced cell phone calls and computer entries. He succeeds by breaking those scenes up and returning time and again to the human drama inside the gated home where Pearls anguished and five-months-pregnant wife Mariane (Angelina Jolie) waits for news along with other journalists a U.S. security agent (Will Patton) and a Pakistani counterterrorism official. Pearl (Dan Futterman) a Jew in a hotbed of anti-Semitism is seen in the opening of the movie preparing for his interview with an elusive source about connections between shoe bomber Richard Reid and Al Qaeda then throughout the movie in flashbacks that fill out the deeply loving relationship between him and his wife. Jolie - with a padded belly and a passing French accent (Mariane is French and Afro-Cuban) - plays Mariane as the strong compassionate woman we came to know in news reports at the time and through her book. For nine days she fights her fear with hope knowing from terrorist tapes that Daniel is still alive. When she gets the ultimate bad news Jolies feral wailing breaks your heart. The film covers a lot of territory including the shaky politics of Pakistan the hatred of Jews the assumption that American journalists were all CIA agents and that the 9/11 attacks were staged by the Israeli secret service. Thankfully it does not re-create the moment - seen by millions via the tape made and disseminated by the terrorists - of Pearls beheading. jmathewsnydailynews.com Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

In A Mighty Heart Mariane Pearl (Angelina Jolie) is seen with her husband Daniel (Dan Futterman) in flashbacks. Photo Courtesy Photo A Mighty Heart 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Frustration is not a photogenic emotion -- furrowed brow meets jiggly camera and jarring edits -- but director Michael Winterbottom has devoted his past two narrative features to that self-same disruptive mindset. With 2005s Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story he turned a chaotic 18th-century tome into a movie about coitus interruptus and the comedic jumble of living. Now with A Mighty Heart he has turned Mariane Pearls memoir of confusion and grief into a film about confusion and grief -- a movie that captures the frustration of not knowing the unconsummated urge to comprehend. It is not surprisingly a difficult movie to follow even though we all know the outcome Pearls husband Daniel kidnapped South Asia bureau chief for the Wall Street Journal will be decapitated by Pakistani extremists who condemn him as an American and a Jew. There is no window for doubt or hope here; we know that going in. We also know all the irrelevant minutiae behind Angelina Jolies fecund personal life and we recall the whoops of outrage that went up when Jolie a mixed-bag Caucasian with Iroquois heritage was cast as Pearl a multiracial French journalist whose roots sprawl over several continents. But the uproar over ethnic bona fides misses the point in a film that outlines the evils of bias If anyones message rebukes clannish thinking its Daniel and Mariane Pearls. Go in colorblind. And if any performance peels back layers of artifice and expectation its Jolies. Her turn as Mariane proves the most impassioned -- and least distracting -- element in a movie that otherwise fails to find the drama in a post-9/11 tragedy observed by heartbroken millions. This is less a failure of thespian execution than an off-putting byproduct of John Orloffs approach to the script which recounts Pearls search for her husband in scenes built on the chattering scrum of police work. We see Pearl himself (Dan Futterman) mainly in flashbacks. Names are tossed around (Sheikh Gilani Masud the Fixer shoe bomber Richard Reid) suspects are interviewed friends and associates are shuttled in and out. Every now and then a Sharpie squeaks on a whiteboard its crisscrossed references detailing Daniels disappearance during a misfired rendezvous. At the heart of almost every scene is Jolies Pearl her pregnant form moving with grace through a thicket of cops and officials. The films enormous supporting cast includes a few standouts Archie Panjabi as an Indian woman who works for the Journal in Pakistan and winds up the target of prejudice; Will Patton as a diplomatic security man who relishes interrogation (""I want a front-row seat when they hang em up by their feet and beat em with sticks""); most of all Irfan Khan as a Pakistani cop on the job a captain who emits the exhausted integrity of a patriot trying to save face for his country. Winterbottom might be the director and Jolie might be the star but this is Pearls movie -- from her perspective dedicated to the son that her husband never saw. Someday the tale of Daniels kidnapping might be told from Daniels point of view. It might capture the horror of his captivity the drama of his attempted escapes the shock of his beheading. But A Mighty Heart is not his story; its hers. And no matter how frustrating no matter how grim it stands as a tribute to her unswerving love for a man and the freedoms he stood for. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Wide-Ruled 70-Sheet Spiral-Bound Notebook for 17 cents +...

Marianes boundless wail is the truest moment in ""A Mighty Heart"" starring Angelina Jolie and Dan Futterman as real-life journalists caught in a maelstrom after the 9/11 attacks. This is saying something. For director Michael Winterbottoms film of Mariane Pearls book constantly reaches for the authentic with subtle tenacity. In recent years Jolie seems to have cast a spell over her directors. Smitten by the kitten and her mouth they shoulder much of the blame for our sinking feeling that whatever promise flowered in ""Girl Interrupted"" and ""Gia"" wilted too quickly. (Granted she was great fun in ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith."") In ""A Mighty Heart"" Jolie vanishes into Mariane Pearl. And she does so without taking the route many actresses do in indie films - playing ugly. The real-life Mariane is beautiful and savvy her hair topped by a mop of curls. Jolie is transformed into Dannys brainy partner in journalism. Shes under duress but handling it like the professional she is. Adopting her characters French-inflected English Jolie adds further distance between her star shine and the fine role. Shot in Pakistan and Mumbai India much of the drama unfolds in the home of Asra Nomani (Archie Punjabi) a colleague of Pearls at The Wall Street Journal. An American Muslim of Indian descent Nomani is on leave from the WSJ and living boldly in Karachi. Mariane and Danny travel to Pakistan on Sept. 12 2001 in part because Danny Pearl doesnt want to go to Afghanistan. It is too likely to become a war zone. He and Mariane are soon to be parents. They stop in Karachi on the final days of their Pakistan stint. She is six months pregnant. He likes to carry on whispered conversations with the baby whom they call ""Embryo."" On Jan. 23 2002 Danny heads out to pursue a last lead. He hopes to meet a Muslim cleric who may be the spiritual leader to ""Shoe Bomber"" Richard Reid. He doesnt return. There was an admirable clarity and lovely craft in the dispatches Pearl sent to the Wall Street Journal. He was the papers South Asia bureau chief. And the movie answers Pearls fair-minded ethic with its own. Winterbottom a director of the politically and culturally astute films ""Welcome to Sarejevo"" ""In This World"" and the hybrid documentary ""The Road to Guantanamo"" and longtime cinematographer Marcel Zyskind use documentary-style camerawork to convey intimacy. At times the film jars. The streets of Karachi Pakistan are crowded disorienting. Other times the mood is claustrophobic as when the Pakistani police FBI and other law enforcement agents invade Asras home. Before Danny disappeared the house seemed like an oasis of entitlement nestled behind gates and guards. In her touching tough-minded book Mariane Pearl invites us into her and Dannys story. They met at a party in Paris. She and her mother (a Cuban in Paris) were dancing. Pearl already a serious world traveler watched captivated. In ""A Mighty Heart"" we get but an inkling of the Danny of the memoir which Mariane wrote to tell son Adam about his father. Futtermans portrayal is appealing if muted. Winterbottom and writer John Orloff dont exploit whatever terror Pearl might have experienced during his brief captivity. Why? Because they dont allow themselves access to that part of the story. ""A Mighty Heart"" is a tale for those left behind by one left behind. Most of all it is the necessary story of a person refusing to give into engulfing fear. Like other films dealing with the terror attacks of 9/11 it is colored by our ache for understanding and our sense of foreboding. If you fear the use of the snuff video the murderers called ""The Slaughter of the Spy-Journalist the Jew Daniel Pearl"" know that Winterbottom has made a deeply compassionate and utterly honorable movie.

"A Mighty Heart with Angelina Jolie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up A Mighty Heart with Angelina Jolie reviewed. A Mighty Heart with Angelina Jolie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 21 2007 604 PM A (Mostly) Mighty Heart The Mariane Pearl movie cant escape the shadow of Angelina Jolie. By Dana Stevens Angelina Jolie as Mariane Pearl The heart referred to in the title of Mariane Pearls book A Mighty Heart was that of her husband Daniel the Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped and executed by Islamic militants in Pakistan in 2002. But the eponymous organ in the movie A Mighty Heart Michael Winterbottoms brusque economical account of the days after the abduction belongs to Mariane herself. Though Danny (Dan Futterman) appears in brief mainly silent flashbacks throughout the film we see nothing of his time in captivity. This is not a movie about being kidnapped but about searching frantically for your missing mate--and the audience armed with the sickening knowledge that Pearl will be decapitated on video five weeks after his disappearance can only sit and watch with steadily mounting dread. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Of course the films focus shifts from Daniel to Mariane Pearl for another reason as well Mariane is played by Angelina Jolie an actress whose global recognizability quotient is exceeded only by that of the sun. Jolie is by any reasonable standard very good in the role Her French-Cuban accent is impeccable her emotional weather precisely mapped her subtly darkened skin and corkscrew wig convincing. Unfortunately though reasonable standards dont apply to Angelina Jolie. This is one of those roles where casting cant help but trump acting. Like Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra Angelina Jolie IS Mariane Pearl--and that marquee-size ""is"" gets in the way not of her performance but of our ability to suspend disbelief and watch it. Advertisement For the first half-hour A Mighty Heart is in essence a movie about a pregnant lady on the telephone. The increasingly desperate Mariane dials to track down the contact who set up an interview between Danny and a suspected terrorist named Sheikh Gilani. As empty leads pile up and days drag on the posh Karachi compound of Danny and Marianes friend journalist Asra Nomani (Archie Panjabi) becomes an unofficial command center for the search. Mariane and Asra are joined by two of Dannys colleagues at the Journal his editor John Bussey (Denis OHare) and a reporter Steve LeVine (Garry Wilmes). Then when the case is taken over by a local counterterrorism unit led by a cool customer known only as the Captain (a magisterial Irrfan Khan) the film becomes a tense police thriller. Red herrings and false alarms appear so quickly you can barely keep track of the names of terror suspects as Asra and Mariane scribble them on a whiteboard. An envoy from the American Embassy Randall Bennett (Will Patton) joins forces with the Captain to comb the streets of Karachi exhilarated by the Pakistani cops devil-may-care approach to human rights ""I love this city"" he crows as they prepare to raid a civilian dwelling sans warrant. Its hard to know what to make of this films ambivalent treatment of torture especially after Winterbottoms anti-American agitprop in last years The Road to Guantanamo. On the one hand Will Patton has a long tradition of playing creeps and were obviously meant to find his exuberance disturbing. But then again its thanks to the Captains freewheeling interrogation methods that one of the suspects finally delivers a useful name Sheikh Omar who will eventually be captured and convicted for his role in Pearls abduction and murder. The scene in which some of Daniels associates watch the video of his execution (which thankfully remains invisible to the audience) is queasily realistic When youve just watched your colleague beheaded on film what else could you do but pace up and down shouting ""Fuck fuck fuck""? And when Daniels editor whos become a father figure to Mariane gives her the news a moment that could easily have turned to emotional pornography is devastatingly effective acted and shot without a hint of sensationalism. Its not until after the news of Daniels death that A Mighty Heart veers into the third and worst of its incarnations a hagiographic chronicle of the martyrdom of Mariane Pearl. Proportionally this segment makes up a small part of the movie--perhaps the last 15 or 20 of its 103 minutes--but its such a departure in tone that I left the theater remembering the sentimental ending rather than the taut intelligent film that preceded it. By all accounts the real Mariane Pearl is an impressive and admirable person and I have no objection to her coming off well in a movie based on her memoir. But the final moments all but outfit her with a halo as we watch her (in flashback) descend a staircase in a rose-bedecked wedding dress groan her way through a completely unnecessary birthing scene kvell over the resulting baby and finally walk down a Paris street in a chic raincoat holding the hand of her now 5-year-old son. After more than an hour of dense layered storytelling that took pains not to turn into The Angelina Jolie Show it was baffling to watch A Mighty Heart trade on Jolies status as tabloid saint U.N. goodwill ambassador and all-around ""best woman in the world.""

"Mighty Heart A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mighty-heart-a ) Mighty Heart A (United Kingdom/United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Most world renowned people have achieved that status as a result of something accomplished during their lives. Unfortunately Daniel Pearl was among the few who became famous as a result of his death. Pearls kidnapping and subsequent death at the hands of terrorists became a major media story during January and February 2002 as the United States was beginning to flex its muscles overseas in response to the September 11 2001 attacks. A video leaked to the Internet showing Pearls decapitation magnified the tragedy. A Mighty Heart Michael Winterbottoms interpretation of the memoir written by Pearls widow Mariane examines events of that one month period from the perspective of those who sought Daniels release his pregnant wife his friends and colleagues at The Wall Street Journal and the Pakistani security forces. The film is fascinating and at times disturbing but Winterbottoms arms-length style mutes any emotional impact. At the time of his capture Daniel (Dan Futterman) was based in Karachi Pakistan along with his wife Mariane (Angelina Jolie). He was researching a story about possible links between would-be shoe bomber Richard Reid Al Qaeda and Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence. While on his way to interview a religious leader Daniel was nabbed by ""Bashir"" (Aly Khan) and taken to a secret location. Demands were made as a condition of his release. Pakistani security agents Wall Street Journal reporters and others rallied around Mariane attempting to discover who had taken Daniel. Secretary of State Colin Powell became involved. Ultimately although many of those associated with the crime were arrested Daniel could not be saved. He was beheaded on February 1 and the world came to know about it soon after. Although A Mighty Heart is about Pearls capture and death hes not in much of the film. After his kidnapping he is shown only briefly via flashbacks. Instead of portraying Daniels ordeal the story stays with Mariane and the men seeking to uncover Daniels whereabouts. For Mariane its a difficult week-and-a-half as she battles despair and uncertainty. She makes a public appeal to the terrorists and lying in bed at night sends text messages reading ""I love you"" to Daniels turned-off cell phone. Winterbottom elects to film the movie in pseudo-documentary style employing lots of shaky handheld camera shots. While this provides a ""you are there"" perspective it also distances the audiences from the characters. We end up watching the proceedings unfold almost clinically. We are intrigued by the methods employed by the Pakistani security forces to locate Daniel and the complexity of the web of interconnections that emerges (the white board is a useful crib sheet that helps to simplify things) but not moved by Marianes plight. The fact that everyone in the theater likely knows that Daniel will die (and how he will die) also defuses potential tension. Filmed in a different way this screenplay could have formed the basis of a thriller. That however is not Winterbottoms goal. If the movie is emotionally flat it has nothing to do with Angelina Jolies performance. Her Mariane is a compelling and complex individual. For eight days she retains her equanimity - tightly coiled but holding it together. One man comments that he cant imagine someone so restrained is in the midst of such a crisis. There are little moments when Jolie lets us peer through the carefully guarded exterior such as when Mariane is alone in bed. When incontrovertible news arrives about Daniels fate Mariane loses it. This is the clip that will be used to push Jolies claim to an Oscar nomination. Its raw and powerful and feels like the genuine reaction of a pent-up volcano exploding through a cap. Winterbottom is a political director - his The Road to Guantanamo - is a fairly open attack on U.S. policy regarding the Cuban detainee facility. Its therefore interesting that A Mighty Heart is completely non-political. The movie tells its story without making statements for or against any of the groups involved. A Mighty Hearts perspective is exclusively that of the individuals caught up in this tragedy. By staying focused on Mariane it avoids global ramifications. Theres an unspoken statement about the necessity for a free press but that is never verbalized. Why does Daniel put himself in harms way? Because the story must be told. Despite its curiously stoic tone A Mighty Heart retains its capacity to fascinate and intrigue. The film provides a lot of behind-the-scenes information about the investigation. Its also circumspect when it comes to representing Daniels death. We see the reactions of others watching the video but Winterbottom does not feel the need to recreate the journalists gruesome end. He uses words not images to clarify Daniels fate and Marianes unwillingness to view her husbands murder becomes a major point late in the film. This restraint is emblematic of the entire picture. While A Mighty Heart may not be the most complete film that could be made about the story its insider point-of-view gives it a vantage that a more comprehensive movie might not have.

The other presence is the city itself -- vast throbbing with life teeming with misery and as depicted here all but unfathomable to Westerners seeking to penetrate its secrets. This is a smart and serious film however much it may also function as a star vehicle. The director Michael Winterbottom working from a script by John Orloff has turned Mariane Pearls memoir into a relentlessly intense drama about the search for her husband as well as her search for meaning in his death. And the immediacy of the setting heightened by documentary techniques makes this a chastening film a portrait of the explosive new world in which we live. In her own portraiture Ms. Jolie mixes tenderness with implacable toughness. She plays Mariane a journalist herself and six months pregnant at the time as a wife who loves her husband passionately but a woman with no time or inclination for the niceties of behavior once its clear he has been taken prisoner. At that point she becomes an obsessive organizer of the search and a compulsive scourge of anyone who threatens to stand in her way. (One fatuous Pakistani functionary insists that the abduction is an Indian plot.) Given Angelina Jolies celebrity the obvious danger in such a take-no-prisoners style of acting was imposing herself on the real-life story but that hasnt happened. To the contrary the actress enters the character and stays there even during her feral cries in the films most harrowing scene. ENLARGE Dan Futterman (right) as Daniel Pearl and Angelina Jolie (left) as his wife Mariane in A Mighty Heart. Daniel Pearl is played by Dan Futterman (who oddly in this context may be best known as the Oscar-nominated screen writer of ""Capote""). The reporter is seen fleetingly at first as he arrives in Karachi from Islamabad then goes to his fateful meeting with a supposedly legitimate source for a story he was doing on the shoe bomber Richard Reid. I didnt know Danny so all I can say about Mr. Futtermans performance is that it and his physical resemblance to his character seem persuasive. But Dannys character seems persuasive too -- not a hero of the war on terror as some have sought to cast him and certainly not the incautious naif that others have thought him to be but a first-rate reporter of maturity reflexive decency insatiable curiosity reasonable prudence and unreasonable dedication to finding the truth of whatever story he might have been working on. Against most Hollywood odds Danny Pearls tragically truncated life story has fallen into good hands thanks to the films producers (first among them Brad Pitt) and to the filmmaker they entrusted with the production. For much of the past decade Michael Winterbottom who was born in England has been refining his agile style in such extraordinary films as ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" and ""In This World"" and in last years ""The Road to Guantanamo."" Its a style that integrates drama and documentary footage mixes professional with non-professional actors and yields a sense of place thats as vivid as anything seen on TV news. ENLARGE On one occasion the stylist stumbled. ""The Road to Guantanamo"" was long on immediacy but short on factuality. And one aspect of the technique here amounts to tacit editorial comment. Through the use of oppressive close-ups quick cuts film-noir peeks into labyrinthine neighborhoods and long lenses that compress the confusion of Karachis streets into pandemonium the director and his Danish-born cameraman Marcel Zyskind have made the city seem endlessly menacing. What would the same locales have looked like if theyd been shot by a Third World filmmaker? Yet the films point of view is inevitably that of an outsider which Danny Pearl was and menace is the essence of this shattering story which has been told with skill and urgent conviction. ""A Mighty Heart"" makes the terms of the terrorist threat palpable. Evan Almighty When God commands a modern-day Noah to build an ark in ""Evan Almighty"" he gives him a book called ""Ark Building for Dummies."" This is movie-making by and for dummies a sappy little bible story blissed out on its own ineptitude thats full of birds (plus their doo) that looks like ""The Birds"" when it isnt aping ""Dr. Dolittle"" and that is definitely though far from incidentally for the birds. ENLARGE Steve Carell in ""Evan Almighty The Evan of the title is Evan Baxter last seen in the 2003 Jim Carrey comedy ""Bruce Almighty."" Evan played by Steve Carell was Bruces rival the self-satisfied TV newscaster who suddenly began to spout gibberish on the air. (More gibberish that is than TV newscasters usually spout.) Mr. Carell plays Evan again but this time in Jim Carreys absence his character has graduated from bit player to hero and from newscaster to a freshman congressman who got elected with the hollow campaign slogan Change the World. (Which is admittedly no more hollow than the gibberish that political candidates usually spout.) God is played once again by Morgan Freeman whose suave charm can sell all sorts of silliness but not the amiable imbecility peddled by this film. None of it makes much sense. Gods commandment kicks in after Evan proves himself a poor steward of the environment -- he drives a Hummer and lends his name to a bill that will destroy the national parks. But why would that make him a candidate for ark captain? And why do people think hes crazy since hordes of animals as well as birds follow him wherever he goes? Though these are troubling questions their significance pales in comparison to the idiocy of Evans itinerary. His vessel travels only from suburban Virginia to Capitol Hill on a flood tide thats mostly inside the Beltway. Still thats far enough to be certified as a ride. Look for an ark sometime soon at a theme park near you.    DVD TIP In a comic vein Michael Winterbottom has made such exhilarating intricate films as ""Tristram Shandy -- A Cock and Bull Story"" (2005) a postmodern rendering of the 18th-century novel by Laurence Sterne and ""24 Hour Party People"" (2002) a docudrama about the Manchester music scene of the 1980s and 90s. Both of them star the irrepressible English actor Steve Coogan.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 22 2007 Save for later Saved On so many levels ""A Mighty Heart"" is almost as excruciating to write about as it is to watch. It has many of the virtues of a first-rate political thriller and yet who can think of it in those terms?Based on the memoir of his widow Mariane Pearl its about the 2002 kidnapping of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl and the five-week hunt for the Islamist terrorists who would prove to be his killers.Danny played by actor and ""Capote"" screenwriter Dan Futterman is first introduced to us in Karachi Pakistan where he is running down a story about would-be shoe bomber Richard Reid. Recently arrived from Afghanistan where both he and the pregnant Mariane played by Angelina Jolie were covering the post-9/11 US bombings Danny is quickly lured into a treacherous endgame with his captors. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The brief shot of him waving goodbye to Mariane as he gets into a cab is ominous in the extreme. From that point on except for a few subsequent moments with Danny on his fated rounds and a couple of flash backs to his wedding day and marital bliss we never see him again. His absence is the movies strongest presence. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 As with Mariane and the expanding circle of advisers and friends who attempt to locate Danny we are put in the harrowing position of ferreting out the facts of his disappearance piece by piece. We unlike the protagonists know the outcome which adds an extra layer of despair.Directed with tense docudrama exactness by Michael Winterbottom from a screenplay by John Orloff ""A Mighty Heart"" is in one sense an anatomy of how people under extreme duress keep the faith. When Dannys parents after reports that he has gone missing hear the news that he has been kidnapped they are jubilant. It means hes alive. When Mariane sees the video of Danny as a captive she reads defiance in his body language.Interviewed on television Mariane is asked what message she would like to send Danny and without hesitation she says ""I love you."" The romance between them is among the most quietly believable depictions of ardor that I have ever seen in a movie. Before he is kidnapped we see Danny fooling with his very pregnant wife or talking shop with dinner friends and we recognize immediately the emotional honesty that is the armature of their love. Honesty is also at the heart of their passion for reporting. (Although it presents obvious dangers in his line of work Danny is always forthcoming about being Jewish.)The Pearls shared devotion to the cause of journalistic truth is what sets this movie apart from so many other movies about reporters in war zones even great ones like ""Under Fire."" Is it more dangerous now to be a reporter than at any other time in history? Probably not and it would be another form of romanticism to think so but it may seem like the stakes are higher now and the methods of subterfuge ever more Byzantine.The search for Danny in ""A Mighty Heart"" is accomplished mostly through high-tech skullduggery and it leads to the inescapable conclusion that as individuals our survival or obliteration is dependant on how wired we are into the world.With her belly protruding and her hair piled high Jolie completely absorbs herself in the role. Raised in France and of Afro-Cuban and Dutch descent Mariane is worldly in the best sense - she gains sustenance from the differentness of her life experiences.""A Mighty Heart"" puts great store in Marianes spiritual composure and this is the only part of the movie that seems insufficient to me. Her yowls of rage and disbelief when she hears the news of Dannys execution soon give way to a kind of transcendence. Her articulation of sorrow is glossed over and she becomes a paragon of how to rise above grief.Winterbottom wants us to see Mariane as a champion of the soul and a shining example of how to survive these parlous times. But the emotional effect of ""A Mighty Heart"" is too tangled and inchoate for such easy uplift. The movies power diminishes its conclusion. Grade A Rated R for language.

And they are undeniably powerful. But for the most part Michael Winterbottoms well-intended film the true story of an idealistic journalist and his gallant wife disinvites emotion by focusing on process at the expense of passion. Pearl a reporter for The Wall Street Journal arrived in Karachi Pakistan early in 2002 committed to opening dialogue among Islamists Christians and Jews. The day before he was scheduled to leave Karachi the journalist was kidnapped and barbarically murdered by jihadists who videotaped his beheading. Based on the memoir of the same name by Mariane Pearl herself a radio journalist A Mighty Heart is a portrait of Mariane (Angelina Jolie) seesawing between hope and hopelessness in the weeks between her husbands abduction and his death. Jolie delivers a focused and unfussy performance doing an honorable job imitating Marianes inimitable Cuban-French accent. Disappearing under the curly coif resembling that of Cher circa Moonstruck Jolie suppresses her essential Angelina-ness completing her transition from the screens sultry siren to its Earth Mother. Michael Winterbottoms unsentimental film is less a profile in courage than a just-the-facts maam procedural. It focuses on how Mariane five months pregnant in a foreign country advanced the operation to find her husband. Danny is played by Dan Futterman Capotes screenwriter nicely cast as the reporter and running the emotional gamut from earnest to goofy. To experience the grief of a death one must know something of the life no? Thats the assumption of a movie like Silkwood. It is not assumed in A Mighty Heart which tells us precious little about Mariane and Danny - and even less about the politics behind Dannys kidnapping. ""What do Americans really know about Afghanistan and Pakistan . . . other than bombing them?"" asks a friend of Marianes as they untangle the knotted political and bureaucratic threads that might lead them to Danny. Good question and one that opens the door for the filmmakers to provide context absent from the film. Because Danny is Jewish he is suspected of being an agent of Mossad the Israeli secret police. Because he is American he is suspected of being a CIA op. That some Pakistanis hate Jews and Americans is a given rather than a theme to be developed. Flanked by diplomats bureaucrats and reporter chums in the house of her husbands colleague - human firecracker Asra Nomani (Archie Panjabi) - Mariane maps every clue. The villa that serves as their base of operations resembles a fortification distant from the hubbub of Karachi. In the films best performance Irrfan Khan (the father in The Namesake) plays Captain head of Pakistans anti-terrorism squad who keeps his cool as he turns the heat up on the suspected kidnappers. Winterbottom permits Jolie one emotional scene; and she makes the most of it keening Marianes almost-unbearable lament for her lost husband. Wouldnt the audience feel her loss more profoundly had the filmmakers emphasized what Danny and Mariane stood for and not what felled him? A Mighty Heart 1/2 (out of four stars) Produced by Andrew Eaton Dede Gardner and Brad Pitt directed by Michael Winterbottom written by John Orloff based on the book by Mariane Pearl photography by Marcel Zyskind music by Harry Escott and Molly Nyman distributed by Paramount Vantage.

"A Blow to the Heart washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies A Blow to the Heart In ""A Mighty Heart"" Angelina Jolie is transformed and transforming as the woman whose journalist husband was murdered by terrorists in 2002. (By Peter Mountain -- Paramount Vantage Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 22 2007 A mournful sense of inevitability pervades ""A Mighty Heart"" in which Angelina Jolie stars as Mariane Pearl whose husband Daniel a Wall Street Journal reporter was kidnapped and beheaded in Pakistan while his wife and a team of colleagues and investigators frantically tried to find him. The movie an adaptation of Mariane Pearls memoir and directed by Michael Winterbottom brings those dreadful weeks back with brutally vivid detail as a taut meticulously crafted police procedural. Part thriller part melodrama ""A Mighty Heart"" recalls last years ""United 93"" -- in its technical prowess and artistry but also in its harrowing emotional arc one that clearly aims to inspire viewers though it may just as likely leave them feeling utterly wrung out. Welcome to the new Cinema of Compulsive Reenactment wherein excruciatingly painful recent events are rushed to the screen with breathless almost fetishistic detail and whose precise aims are subject to interpretation. Is this instant mythologizing a form of catharsis? Closure? Rank exploitation? Or a particularly American impatient brand of revisionism designed to create an immediately usable past? These are the philosophical questions that haunt ""A Mighty Heart"" and it answers with a degree of subtlety and sophistication that skeptics might find surprising. The film begins on Jan. 23 2002 the day Danny was taken hostage and a day like any other for the Pearls both working as journalists in Karachi. (Hes played in the film by Dan Futterman.) Danny is tracking down a lead to a possible connection between al-Qaeda and Richard Reid the British ""shoe bomber""; Mariane a freelance journalist and six months pregnant does some interviews goes shopping for that nights dinner and checks at regular intervals with Danny by cellphone. By dinnertime when he hasnt come home the first clouds of apprehension begin to gather. Awareness dawns slowly then with a terrible crushing certitude as Danny doesnt pick up and Mariane makes the first call to the U.S. Embassy. Soon the house the Pearls have been sharing with fellow journalist Asra Nomani (Archie Panjabi) is filled with American diplomats Karachi police and eventually the FBI portrayed in one of the films few comic flourishes by an amusingly no-nonsense female agent played by Jillian Armenante. Winterbottom like his countryman Paul Greengrass (who directed ""United 93"") has been experimenting with realism to terrific effect in recent years with films such as ""Welcome to Sarajevo"" ""In This World"" and ""The Road to Guantanamo."" In ""A Mighty Heart"" he brings all his talents to bear on a vivid densely layered portrait not just of one woman but of a city. With handheld cameras and a fearless sense of urgency and spontaneity he plunges viewers into the neon-lit thrum and impossible beauty of Karachi (where some scenes were filmed) conveying not only its fascination for foreign correspondents like the Pearls but also the daunting needle-in-a-haystack task of finding Danny in all that teeming humanity. Even amid the polyglot cacophony and chaos ""A Mighty Heart"" skillfully threads viewers through a complicated skein of players political agendas and dead ends in an investigation that ranges from al-Qaeda to Mossad to Pakistans political opponents in India. Quite wisely Winterbottom doesnt get too caught up in the ticktock of Dannys fatal journey instead using brief flashbacks to speculate on how his abduction occurred. ""A Mighty Heart"" instead focuses on Mariane played by Jolie in brown contact lenses and a diadem of black curls to resemble Mariane who like Joan Didion in ""The Year of Magical Thinking"" reacts like any good journalist would to being ambushed by personal horror She keeps her head assumes control and takes notes. Like Didion shes one cool customer. Jolie is a star of such super-stratospheric proportions that the chances of her disappearing into a character role would seem slim at best. But it turns out that she is the perfect choice to play Mariane not only because she delivers a restrained understated performance but because her persona as a citizen of the world -- as a U.N. representative activist and mother -- so seamlessly meshes with the global consciousness that the Pearls represent. She blends just as seamlessly with ""A Mighty Hearts"" fine ensemble of supporting actors including Panjabi and Will Patton as U.S. consul Randall Bennett.(Marianes quietly appalled gaze as Bennett extols the virtues of Pakistans notorious interrogation methods is a moment of physical eloquence typical of Jolies astute vanity-free performance.) Mariane and Danny emerge in the film as two people at home no matter where they are on the planet plunging headlong into the countries theyre covering. Theyre not adrenalin junkies as so many foreign correspondents are characterized but connection junkies reveling in vagrant moments of mutual comprehension. Of course it was precisely comprehension that failed when Danny was murdered for being an American a journalist and a Jew -- a blow to his own ideals that makes the films agonizing denouement all the more shattering. But Mariane refuses to put her husbands murder in a context of American exceptionalism or even personal outrage; during one of her first television appearances she notes that during Dannys captivity several Pakistanis were victims of terror. One gets the idea that for Mariane her fiercely held humanism isnt a matter of sentiment but rather seasoned practicality Its about accuracy. A central even existential contradiction vexes ""A Mighty Heart"" which is that one can deeply admire it as a piece of filmmaking and still harbor misgivings about why we need to have these stories packaged for the big screen. If that bigger question will never be easily resolved ""A Mighty Heart"" still avoids its genres twin pitfalls of gratuitous masochism and cheap sentiment. ""United 93"" for all its rigorous refusal to engage in reassuring theatrics never quite transcended the former; as for ""World Trade Center"" which also focused on the events of Sept. 11 2001 its eagerness to impose redemptive meaning on that day resulted in a surfeit of the latter. ""A Mighty Heart"" threads this needle with sober assurance offering a clear-eyed retelling of Danny Pearls murder but finally in focusing on Marianes response delivering an affecting and yes redemptive lesson in moral comportment. Faced with unspeakable grief Mariane doesnt give in to xenophobia or selective indignation but with her best self turns her loss into a plea for the cosmopolitanism she and her husband personified. One can only hope that the nuance with which the filmmakers make this point wont be lost on audiences more accustomed to the rhetoric -- political and cinematic -- of retribution. Ultimately ""A Mighty Heart"" is an epic romance at once doomed and full of hope about two people in love with the world even when it didnt love them back. A Mighty Heart (100 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for profanity.

By Anthony Lane Angelina Jolie as Mariane Pearl in Michael Winterbottoms movie.   Credit LARA TOMLIN How do you solve a problem like Angelina? Ms. Jolie is now more of a brand than a person and she comes in six flavors 1. The celebrity. Angelina Jolie is so famous that when she looks in the mirror her reflection asks for an autograph. The only publication in this country yet to feature her on its cover is The American Numismatic Magazine and even that will change the moment she bends down to pick up a nickel. 2. The sexpot. In this she is unchallenged and yet her timing is off by fifty years. When it comes to channelling her carnal appeal no current film director has a clue; the guy she needs is Frank Tashlin who guided Jayne Mansfield through ""The Girl Cant Help It"" (1956) and ""Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?"" (1957) and whose eyeballs if confronted with Jolie in the flesh would pop out on cartoon springs and bob around. 3. The Brad handler. She took one look at the worlds most widely desired man and scooped him up with no more ado than a Parisian grande dame tucking a Chihuahua into her clutch bag. 4. The mother. Official estimates as to how many children Jolie now possesses and from how many continents change on a weekly basis. When not giving birth herself she likes to order in. How this has affected Mr. Pitt is unclear but his expression is sometimes that of a man who stepped out to hail a cab and got run over by a fleet of trucks. 5. The world saver. Jolie is a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Her father Jon Voight told the Biography Channel that ""shes developed into one of our great humanitarians."" This was clearly on the minds of political leaders when they met Jolie at a summit of the World Economic Forum in Davos two years ago. Half of them offered their entire foreign-aid budget for a chance to fetch her a mai tai. 6. Oh yes the actress. This last talent so often neglected is displayed in her new film ""A Mighty Heart"" and without it the legend of Angelina Jolie would be little more than a vaporous joke. The movie directed by Michael Winterbottom lies about as far from the trials of Lara Croft as is cinematically possible. Jolie plays Mariane Pearl the wife of Daniel Pearl (Dan Futterman) a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal who in 2002 was kidnapped and beheaded in Karachi Pakistan. The story begins on the day of his disappearance; as the horrors unfurl we see Mariane replaying in her mind the moment when she bade her husband farewell--a wave and a smile as he climbed into a cab. He was due to interview a Muslim cleric named Sheikh Gilani but the arrangement was a trap. Once Pearl has vanished we follow the threads of rumor and report from the viewpoint of his wife a cluster of friends and the local police. The result like many of Winterbottoms films lies an inch short of disarray; we can keep pace with the investigation but only just and that sense of splintering honors the unpredictability of the setting. We hurtle from the tracking down of taxi-drivers to the tracing of cell-phone calls and nocturnal raids on the homes of suspects; such momentum is undeniably but unpleasantly exciting because we already know the outcome. However diligent the authorities chase against the clock the clock will win. Promising leads hit a wall; when Mariane gets to see Pakistans Interior Minister he blames the Indian intelligence services for having set up the abduction. Add the aggressive questioning of Daniels female colleague Asra (Archie Panjabi) who happens to be Indian and you get an itchy demonstration of regional mistrust. Stronger still than the encroaching panic however is Marianes determination not to cave in to it. Those who saw her being interviewed at the time were struck by her preternatural serenity; her book also called ""A Mighty Heart"" (2003) is Winterbottoms principal source although her title may be too noble for his manner--the dressed-down on-the-fly approach that lends even his more formal endeavors like ""Jude"" (1996) and ""Code 46"" (2003) an air of documentary. He is the very model of a modern moral filmmaker not unromantic exactly and too impassioned for the scowls of cynicism but baffled and perhaps a little bored by the traditional forms of romance. When his loving couples cling together--as they did stickily for ""9 Songs"" (2004)--Winterbottom loses interest. When they are yanked apart as in ""A Mighty Heart"" his own heart quickens its beat. Mariane is French-speaking with a Cuban mother and Jolie is equipped with corkscrewed hair tinted skin and murmuring accent. We brace ourselves for a star turn a hundred minutes of vanity project but heres the thing it never happens. Jolie slips into the part ducks in and out of the action and generally plays second string to the onrush of events. Blessed with the worlds most recognizable mouth she confines herself to a single skeptical pout as Mariane is reassured that ""no one would ever want to hurt Danny."" Not so he is an American Jew investigating Muslim extremists and as his wife knows that makes him a marked man. Only once does Mariane crack. Informed of her husbands death and of its savage circumstances she goes to her room crouches over and keens. It could be the howl from a Greek tragedy except that our heroine is not disporting herself on a stage majestic in her grief but filmed from so close that you can count the knobs of vertebrae at the top of her spine. By this time she is heavily pregnant and her screams are a terrible parody of birth pangs--an echo that Winterbottom makes explicit without needing to in the closing scenes. This hasty high-intensity barely consolable film is just the kind of tale on which he thrives--and more surprisingly on which Jolie will come to depend if she wants to keep her head above the tides of madness in which partly on her own initiative she has chosen to float. Will success spoil Angelina Jolie? Not yet. Can she help it? Yes she can. ""Aunt Julia Aunt Julia"" cried the girl in the long socks and the penny loafers. Her name was Emma Roberts and she was sixteen. ""Why what is it?"" exclaimed Aunt Julia a pretty woman who would not give her age. She was over by the window of the living room rearranging her photographs of disastrous fiances. ""I have finished with Nancy Drew"" replied Emma disappointedly. ""My goodness Well sometimes these things are not meant to last"" sighed her aunt. ""Dont be silly"" corrected the girl. ""Nancy is not a person. She is a fictional construct created in 1930 by Carolyn Keene herself a pseudonym under whom simply tons of different yet equally useless writers have taken shelter. Dont you remember? I went off to play Miss Drew in the new movie. I was encouraged to do so by the example of my father Eric himself an actor though never in the same wage bracket as you his more famous sister. Not that he minded"" she added with a silvery laugh. Aunt Julia smiled something she seldom did in public for less than twenty million dollars. ""And tell me what was it like?"" ""It was splendid"" replied Emma pausing to adjust the headband on her fine reddish hair. ""The story begins in River Heights a town full of delightful white people. I am motherless and my father is a lawyer so both of us are rather sad For a treat we move to Los Angeles where the girls at my new school say I remind them of Martha Stewart. They are so right on it really is a joy"" ""And what happens next?"" asked Emmas aunt her excitement mounting. ""Well the house the Drews are renting once belonged to a movie star--you know one of the super-old ones."" ""Like Lana Turner?"" ""Who?"" ""Skip it. Who plays the part of the actress?"" ""The beautiful Miss Laura Elena Harring. After some ace detective work I discovered that she was in a film called Mulholland Drive which dealt with similar material. Isnt that coincidence just a little too suspicious? And the plot leads Nancy to a resort by the name of Twin Palms. Another clue To sum up a friend of mine said the film was like Lynch without the lesbians or the dwarves. What are lesbians Aunt? Are they friends of Snow Whites too?"" ""More than you will ever know dear."" ""Oh Aunt Julia come to the premiere please do. I shall take a tray of cupcakes."" ""I--I--"" Her aunts voice faltered. ""Why what is it?"" ""I doubt if any female over the age of twelve would get much pleasure from the film"" she hazarded. Emma giggled. ""Oh Aunt Julia you may be old but youre not that old. Not just yet"" Her aunts hand crept toward the heavy glass paperweight that stood on the side table next to a portrait of Lyle Lovett which while in soft focus was not quite soft enough. What was she thinking? Finally she spoke ""Oh Im sure the film will do as well as it deserves""  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Aside from Joliewho is very fine though improbably castand a sprinkling of idyllic flashbacks (Daniel gazing into his wifes eyes Daniel caressing her swollen belly) the movie is clipped blunt and grimly realistic. It is practically a policier although the suspense is mitigated by our knowledge that the investigation will end badly. Theres surprisingly little in the way of politics (the director is the Brit Michael Winterbottom whos not known for reticence in that area) and no overarching messageapart from Pearls shining example as an investigative journalist. The conclusions we must draw for ourselves. The most obvious is that in late 2001 and early 2002 we (by which I mean the American media and its consumers) had little idea of the deadly labyrinth into which the war on terror would lead us. When we meet Pearl (Dan Futterman an uncanny look-alike) hes en route to interview a volubly anti-American sheikh possibly connected to would-be shoe bomber Richard Reid. Pearl is no naif but the meeting is supposed to take place in public in a restaurant; hes an internationally known journalistan unlikely target even as Jew for jihadists with a message to get out. From a taxi he phones his wife whos shopping for a dinner party that night to say he loves her and will try not to be too late. The team that subsequently forms around Mariane does not seem promising. Daniels colleague Asra Nomani (Archie Panjabi) is of Indian descent and therefore suspect Some Pakistanis maintained that Pearls kidnapping was orchestrated by India to make their country look bad. A Journal editor (Gary Wilmes) is a bit of a nebbishnot particularly hard-driving. Will Patton plays the guy from the U.S. consulate and Patton has made a career of embodying shifty American officials. Theres no telling which side the Pakistani police captain (Irfan Khan) is on Americas so-called ally in the war on terror has been unreliable and Pearl was investigating alleged ties between Reid and its Police Department. The countrys press reports that Pearl is alternately an agent of the CIA or worse the Mossad. BACKSTORY Lady Chatterleys Lover has sparked controversy in film as well as print. The 1955 French adaptation LAmant de Lady Chatterley was finally released in the U. S. after a 1959 court battleNew York State banned it because it promoted adultery but the Supreme Court reversed that decision. Turns out that the state hadnt seen anything yet Though LAmant was tame subsequent films would push the limits of propriety culminating in Young Lady Chatterley (1977) and its 1985 soft-porny sequel Young Lady Chatterley II. Lady Chatterley tries to amuse herself with gardener reads the IMDB plot summary. But the view of A Mighty Heart (via a book by Mariane Pearl and Sarah Crichton) is that these men and women were finally heroic and that their combined efforts might have saved Pearl had his captors not been eager to humiliate the U.S. and Israel by turning his execution into a grisly propaganda tool. In the compound (while a woman in a headscarf washes the floors and the womans little boy plays in the courtyard) Mariane works the phones and Internet and diagrams the relationships of the major players. Theories are batted around leads pursued cell-phone records seized. Its a surrogate family. The Captain (as the Pakistani policeman is called) and a contingent of soldiers hunt down men who are links in the chain. Pattons Randall Bennett watches with approval (bordering on pleasure) as suspects are hung up beaten and dunked in water. Given that Winterbottoms last film was the righteous docudrama The Road to Guantanamo its a shock to see him dramatize torture so neutrally. The methods arent endorsed as in 24 but theyre unlikely in this context to make anyone yelp about the Geneva Conventions. Mariane Pearl is French and of partly Afro-Cuban descenta challenge for a Caucasian-American (even an exotic-looking one) to pull off. Its hard to forget shes who she is but Jolie is a remarkably canny actress and she plays Mariane with the kind of brusque economy that characterizes the real womans writing and public appearances. Jolie tamps down her drama-queen instincts. Her Mariane is not by and large an emoter When someone compliments her for holding herself together in a statement she tapes to her husbands captors she responds with disbelief. Her only false note is the fault of the script When she hears of the videotape that documents her husbands decapitation she snarls almost at once that she will never see it. Although Mariane reportedly hasnt seen it its unlikely she came out with the line in the throes of the horror. No one is that self-possessed. A Mighty Heart does not re-create any part of that videotape for which I am both grateful and sorry. Winterbottom shows admirable respect for Mariane Pearl and the memory of her husband but the film needs an exclamation point something visceral to drive home the fate of Daniel Pearl. In writing about this movie I finally forced myself to watch that video. Apart from my relief that the actual killing isnt shown I was struck by how pointed its message (as articulated by Pearl on-camera) is that no American is safe. Since then Pearls death has shown up in the culture in myriad forms if only subtextually in movies like Babel (where Americans appear chillingly vulnerable in the Third World). Even the splatter director Eli Roth (Hostel) invoked Pearls murder recently to justify the genre Ive dubbed torture pornand however opportunistic hes not wrong in claiming a link. Near the end of the film Jolies Mariane has the team over for dinner and thanks them for their help. She says they didnt failthat the aim of terrorists is instilling terror. Thats what A Mighty Heart for all its power doesnt do. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Not one to disappear into a role she makes the character fit her fiercely glamorous persona. ""A Mighty Heart"" changes all that. Playing Mariane Pearl the wife of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl who was kidnapped and murdered by Islamic militants in Karachi Pakistan in 2002 Jolie does a miraculous vanishing act down to her complex French accent inflected with the Cuban and Dutch of her parents. Smart prickly courageous her terror often covered over with steely flashes of anger Pearl--as anyone who saw her on TV after her loss--refused the public role of victim that the touchy-feely American media tried to impose on her. Jolie honors her fortitude with a performance of meticulous honesty. Every flicker of Marianes conflicting emotions passes like quicksilver over Jolies face but nothing is milked for pathos.This is in keeping with the tone of director Michael Winterbottoms taut almost documentary approach to the search for Danny Pearl (Dan Futterman) who vanished in Karachi while pursuing a lead on a story about the shoe bomber Richard Reid. Following closely Pearls memoir John Orloffs screenplay unfolds like a police procedural. We are as much in the dark as Mariane as the investigation frantically proceeds headed by the Pakistani counterterrorism expert known as Captain (Irrfan Khan of ""The Namesake"").Winterbottom (""In This World"" ""Welcome to Sarajevo"") who favors a handheld verite style of camerawork has always been expert at gritty atmospherics. Shooting in Karachi often in the very locations where the tragedy unfolded he refuses to tart up an already riveting tale with Hollywood melodramatics. If this sometimes means that we are as confused about what is going on as the participants so be it. Though we know the outcome we still hang on every false lead hoping against hope like Mariane that the story will have a different outcome. (Mercifully the murder itself is not shown.) Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Winterbottoms aversion to sentimentality doesnt mean you wont be moved by ""A Mighty Heart."" Jolies piercing cry of grief when she gets the news of Dannys death cuts right into your heart. But like many of Winterbottoms movies it falls a step short of its full potential. Its tact is both its strength and its weakness. The climax feels rushed its the rare movie these days that feels too short. The intriguing supporting players--Marianes friend and fellow journalist Asra (Archie Panjabi) whose house becomes headquarters for the search; the American security agent Randall Bennett (Will Patton) who seems perversely excited by the danger; the Journal editor (Denis OHare) who flies to Marianes side and the dedicated Captain whose relationship to Mariane is more fleshed out in the book--are all characters wed like to know more intimately. Winterbottom gets the feel of reality pitch-perfect but his British reticence prevents him from making the risky leap from a documentary surface into a deeper kind of art.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The sad saga of slain Wall Street Journal reporter Danny Pearl has made it to the bigscreen with facts figures and beating heart intact in ""A Mighty Heart."" In his first studio venture Michael Winterbottom coaxes forth a staggering wealth of detail from this terse methodical account of Pearls kidnapping and murder in Pakistan seen through the eyes of those who sought his return. Given audiences resistance to films dealing with 9/11 and its aftermath soberly restrained pic reps a mighty tough sell though Angelina Jolies performance as Pearls widow should broaden prospects for the June 22 Stateside release. Adapting Mariane Pearls harrowing memoir director Winterbottom who previously ventured into Mideast politics with ""In This World"" and ""The Road to Guantanamo"" proves to be just the man for the task. Though the prolific British chameleon isnt one to make the same film twice his gifts for docudrama storytelling -- an ability to shepherd complicated narratives avoiding every opportunity for sensationalism in favor of a low-key mounting dread -- couldnt be better suited to the material. Having covered the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan following the Sept. 11 attacks the Pearls were working as journalists in Karachi Pakistan on Jan. 23 2002 -- the day Danny (""Capote"" scribe Dan Futterman) chasing a story about foiled shoe bomber Richard Reid got into a cab and never returned. Sticking close to the very pregnant Mariane (Jolie) pic recounts the restless five-week search for the mans whereabouts and his kidnappers identities all accompanied by a hailstorm of media attention. Screenplay crisply diagrams the labyrinth of false leads and fruitless interrogations with various middlemen Danny may have had contact with on the night of his disappearance. Suspicion ultimately comes to rest on the elusive Omar Saeed Sheikh (Alyy Khan) a known Islamic militant with a history of kidnapping foreigners. Like his fellow suspects Sheikh is seen only briefly and in the most objective possible light. Working in the brisk discursive style of a police procedural Winterbottom scrupulously follows the rescue effort step by agonizing step -- ensuring that the audience is never given additional information despite its foreknowledge of the tragic outcome. Even larger political questions -- the implications say of a scene in which a Pakistani suspect is strung up and interrogated or the grim irony of a journalist couple facing intense media scrutiny -- are subjugated to the flow of the storytelling. Along the way pic also manages to sketch vivid portraits of Marianes key supporters and allies. These include Dannys tough-minded colleague Asra Nomani (Archie Panjabi); a local cop (Irrfan Khan) known simply as Captain determined not to let the case soil Pakistans reputation; American diplomatic security agent Randall Bennett (Will Patton) who tends to see the silver lining in all bad news; and Wall Street Journal higher-up John Bussey (Denis OHare) who arrives in Pakistan after news of the ordeal a comforting but resilient figure. But this is ultimately -- and very intimately -- Mariane Pearls story and much of it rests on Jolie who fits comfortably into the naturalistic mold that shapes the entire ensemble. Though Jolie sports a big belly a high-coiffed hairstyle and a very challenging accent (raised in France Mariane is of Afro-Cuban and Dutch descent) this isnt the sort of commanding star turn in which the performer vanishes behind a well-known celebrity mask but rather a subdued carefully considered portrait of a woman caught between premature grief and persistent hope. Jolie plays Mariane as sharp and prickly but also highly principled and completely devoted to her husband. Wisely Winterbottom opts to shoot her more high-pitched outbursts from a distance or in near-darkness as if refusing to milk more histrionics than necessary. Occasional subdued flashbacks to happier days from Mariane and Dannys marriage including a very brief love scene add emotional texture even as they take something away from the films otherwise unsentimental approach. Pic negotiates its way around another potential landmine -- to show or not to show the widely circulated video of Pearls murder -- re-creating a very brief non-graphic snippet of the contentious footage and getting the facts across with the utmost restraint. Shot on location in Pakistan India and France the film gains considerable authenticity and momentum from its handheld HD lensing by Winterbottoms regular d.p. Marcel Zyskind and Peter Christelis rapid editing rarely allowing a shot to last more than a few seconds.
