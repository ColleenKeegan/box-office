Miramax hide caption toggle caption Miramax Sylvester Stallone brings Rocky Balboa back for one more bone-crunching bout. MGM hide caption toggle caption MGM Peter OToole and Sylvester Stallone may not seem to have much in common. But this week theyre opening films that strike remarkably similar chords OToole finding one last love as an over-the-hill actor in Venus and Stallone returning to the ring as an over-the-hill boxer in Rocky Balboa I know I know youre thinking oh please not Rocky again. I was thinking that too. And a desiccated wizened old Peter OToole isnt really what I was looking to see at Christmastime either. But in their dotage it turns out these two old pros will surprise you. By which I mean that in Rocky Balboa you expect Sylvester Stallone to be beaten down physically. Thats what that tongue-in-cheek training montage is all about. But hes also beaten down emotionally this time a has-been who has retold his same-old-same-old story so often that everyone he tells it to knows the punch-line as it were. And in that Rockys not unlike the 60-year-old actor who plays him trying to keep up with younger stars knowing hes become a kind of punch-line himself. This sad-eyed mumbling mug -- by which I mean both Rocky and Stallone -- can still be endearing when hes down much as we forget that when hes puffed up. And the same-old-same-old story hes telling can be too when outfitted as it is here with a couple of new wrinkles for the aging baby boomer in all of us. As for Peter OToole hes crammed a lot of living into his 74 years and these days he looks it. So much so that in Venus when you see him on a hospital gurney in an operating room early on youll be as worried as the folks gathered around him. Happily when an onscreen director yells ""cut"" you realize its just a scene in a TV show. OTooles playing Maurice a once-distinguished actor who now mostly gets cast as a corpse on TV. Hes still pretty spry though particularly when it comes to the ladies. They no longer look at him but when one of his ancient actor buddies has a 19-year-old niece show up to take care of him Maurice definitely has an eye for her. Shes a bit of a lump more interested in watching TV and drinking up all the liquor in the house than in actually taking care of her Uncle Ian. Maurice asks what she wants to do now that shes in London and she says shed like to be a model. He gets her a job as a nude model for an art class hes hoping to... um audit lets say which is not quite what she had in mind. His attentions appall her actually. But when his health starts to flag she finds ways to give him a little of what he wants. OToole is pretty marvelous in Venus raunchy and charming in about equal measure and hes surrounded by the sort of actors that the Brits have the good sense not to throw on the trash heap when they get on in years Leslie Phillips from the old Carry On comedies portly Richard Griffiths and Vanessa Redgrave as Maurices ex-wife. Redgraves presence reminds you not just of the physical beauty that she and OToole had when they were young but also of the reason that they stood out from the rest of the young cinematic beauties. Their scenes together are elegance itself -- his laugh her dawning realization that their discussions have all been about mortality. Theyre gorgeous together just gorgeous. And when he says to her ""We wont live forever"" you realize what a great reason that is for seeing them now.

Comments Rocky Balboa Sylvester Stallone takes the Italian Stallion around the track one more time doing his best to recapture the sad-sack melancholy of John G. Avildsens Rocky (1976). The current heavyweight champ (Antonio Tarver) dogged by bad press and embarrassed by a computer matchup that has him losing to the 80s Rocky offers the 60-year-old fighter an exhibition match; the Rock bored with retailing old stories at his Philly restaurant and stuck in the doldrums after his wifes death accepts. As usual with Stallones Rocky sequels the schmaltz is unbearable but the implausible fight is plausibly handled and Stallones sincere sadness at growing older makes this an unexpectedly satisfying conclusion to the series.

"Rocky Balboa | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rocky-balboa ) Rocky Balboa (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli Looking back at the Sylvester Stallone pugilist franchise from the end of the line one thing becomes clear there were really only two Rocky movies. Everything else was filler founded on formula and driven by testosterone and adrenaline. The two real films - those that used boxing as a metaphor rather than a means to an end and that focused on human drama - were the 1977 Oscar winner that started things off and perhaps surprisingly Rocky Balboa the seeming afterthought that brings the saga to a fitting conclusion. These two features are solid bookends around a mess of a series that started going wrong when Rocky beat Apollo Creed in a re-match and got worse from there. When I heard Stallone was going to make a sixth Rocky film I was as skeptical as the next person. After Rocky 4 and 5 hadnt movie-goers undergone enough indignities? Why resurrect Rocky now when no one under the age of 35 could possibly care about him? It seemed like a bad idea from the beginning - a lame attempt by an aging action star to reclaim past glory. This turns out to have been an unfair characterization of Stallone and his movie. Rocky Balboa has something to say. Its about flawed human beings and how they relate to each other. Its about reclaiming self-respect and dignity. Before taking center stage during the final half-hour boxing rarely encroaches upon the storyline. Its 2006 and Rockys career is long behind him. His beloved Adrian has died yet he feels closer to her than to any of the living people around him. He and his son Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia) are in a ""Cats in the Cradle"" situation with the son too busy for the father. So Rocky does the meet-and-greet at his restaurant and lets one meaningless day pass after another. When he re-connects with Marie (Geraldine Hughes) a girl he met during the first film he finds another individual let down by life - someone he can bond with. His is a sad lonely unfulfilled life. Without Adrian he has no anchor and he is seeking meaning. Meanwhile the current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is struggling for respect. After defeating one chump after another he has become reviled. (Dixons unwillingness to fight a legitimate challenger allows Stallone to take a none-to-subtle jab at the state of real boxing these days.) His manager comes up with the ultimate publicity stunt stage an exhibition between Dixon in the prime of his career against old Rocky who is something of a folk hero. Rocky is installed as a prohibitive underdog but as viewers of the series know hes never better than when hes not expected to win. However Rocky Balboa like the original Rocky isnt about winning. Its about giving everything and facing ones fears. Over the years the Rocky series has lost the majority of its cast members. With Talia Shire now gone the only returnee (other than Stallone) is Burt Young once again reprising his role as the irascible Paulie. Milo Ventimiglia and Geraldine Hughes are the only newcomers with significant screen time and while both fill functions neither impresses. Antonio Tarvers Mason Dixon isnt much of a character although it is nice that the movie takes pains to make sure the audience doesnt view him as a villain. At heart hes not a bad guy although he has issues. Rocky Balboa is not an action movie. During the first 70 minutes the movie is primarily dialogue and reminiscences. It contains some of the best acting Stallone has ever done. This is the same Rocky we have gotten to know over the years but here we see his vulnerability. Hes not very smart but hes generous and hes not good at hiding his emotional pain. For him it was always Adrian. She was the reason that losing the first fight was still a victory - because he got her. Now she lies beneath a simple headstone. There are times when the drama threatens to become heavy-handed and the relationship with Marie never gels in a meaningful way. It feels unfinished. But Stallone functioning as writer director and star puts all his energy into peeling back 30 years. Rocky Balboa is not as good as Rocky but it allows us to forget the other four sequels none of which was memorable. Admittedly the moment the strains of ""Gonna Fly"" begin blaring from the theater speakers as Rocky starts his latest round of training there is an urge to stand up and cheer. And the fight at the end still stirs the soul. Even the worst Rocky movies possessed a visceral power when it came to the in-ring sequences. The ending of Rocky Balboa echoes the ending of Rocky in more ways than one. Stallone has said this is it for Rocky - even if the film is major box office hit there will be no seventh outing.

(AP Photo/MGM/John Bramley) Photo John Bramley O Adrian Whyd you have to go and die on me? 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Rocky Balboa Starring Sylvester Stallone Burt Young and Antonio Tarver. Directed by Sylvester Stallone. (PG. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. Anyone who appreciates Sylvester Stallone or enjoys the ""Rocky"" movies will find moments to enjoy in ""Rocky Balboa"" and will leave the theater reasonably satisfied. Its just good to see the guy and its good to revisit the character. And thats everything good to be said for the experience. In a way thats enough but its only just enough and thats disappointing. It would not have been unreasonable to go in with bigger hopes. Stallone is a talented popular artist and it has been 16 years since the last ""Rocky"" movie. Surely Stallone wouldnt make another one just to return to the same old formula or so the idea went He probably has something new to say He probably has a bite into a really good story This is probably going to be almost as good as the first one and better than any of the others Well actually no no and no. Whatever else can be said for ""Rocky Balboa"" it did not take 16 years to write or even to gestate. The one big change isnt a good one Rockys wife Adrian is dead. This is very bad news not just for Rocky but for us because it means seeing Rocky mooning around her grave like a dog with a dead master. It also means a film cast in gloom and worst of all it means Rocky has nobody to talk to other than Burt Young as Paulie his brother-in-law. What a curious case the career of Young. The man works constantly but like it or not hes going into the books for playing a thoroughly unpleasant idiot and -- it must be said -- for playing him exceptionally well. Check out any photo of Young as himself and radiating from it is a consciousness wholly unlike the insular thick-brained hostile moron we see in ""Rocky Balboa."" Unfortunately Young is so convincing at playing Paulie that to see him is to wish hed go away. Adrians death opened up many creative possibilities for Stallone but he chose the least dynamic one for Rocky long-lasting unending never-to-be-assuaged grief. Stallone missed his chance. Instead of using Adrians death as just one more stripe in Rockys march toward sainthood -- instead of using it as a pretext for a lot of filler conversations in which Rocky pines for the good old days -- he should have used it to take the character in a new direction. For example Adrian is dead. Rocky is stupid. And so we find him married to a stripper who has spent all his money. That would have at least justified the fact that he still lives in the old neighborhood. Now what can he do? Teach at MIT? He has to go back in the ring. Now that would be a real ""Rocky"" story about what might actually happen to a big dumb nice celebrity with a lot of jack and no wife to keep him in line. Stallone knows something about the corruptive influence of the spotlight after all. Alas Stallone was determined to turn Rocky into a moral exemplar which is the cliche writer-directors can fall into when they develop a character for themselves. It happened to Billy Jack and it even happened though in an interesting way to Chaplins Little Tramp. And so the saintly Rocky spends the first two-thirds of the movie imparting inarticulate but sage life advice on what to do when youre down etc. All of it is corny but some of it is moving anyway. In return in scene after scene people tell Rocky how much they love him how great he is that hes a wonderful guy. Its like SCTVs ""Sammy Maudlin Show"" except that the scenes are made bearable by Stallones earthy benevolence and quirky humor. Then once he has you remembering how much you like Rocky Stallone puts him in a fight and then everything that went before is forgotten and forgiven. Why does Rocky come out of retirement to fight the heavyweight champ (Antonio Tarver)? Stallone comes up with a plausible enough reason. Once again Rocky is an off-the-charts underdog a man in his 50s (Stallone is in fact 60) going up against the most lethal boxer in the world. Thirty years later Stallone is still made of rock and seriously he deserves a cinematic context in which to take off his shirt. His dedication to bodybuilding is awe- inspiring a lifelong commitment. To have a body like that at 60 represents countless hours of pain and effort and its impressive. As for the fight put it this way. The first thing I said when the movie was over was ""Hey good picture."" I said it even though I knew better. -- Advisory A punishing boxing sequence.

In another film at another time American audiences would have thrilled to the sight of enemy troops scattering falling and dying on the ground below. In this film we are on the ground looking up through the eyes of those troops who see the Corsairs as the enemy. The reversal is unsettling to say the least and exactly as intended but then fascinating absorbing and deeply affecting. The release of ""Letters"" follows Mr. Eastwoods recent ""Flags of Our Fathers"" which dramatized Americas horrifically costly battle for the small Pacific island in World War II and the fates of the young men who planted the Stars and Stripes on the summit of Mount Suribachi. ""Letters"" can be seen as a companion piece -- a chronicle of the battle in Japanese with English subtitles from the Japanese point of view. In a larger sense though it is the second and artistically superior half of a single epic film that springs from a single stunning act of compassionate imagination. ENLARGE A scene from Clint Eastwoods Letters From Iwo Jima The pace is deliberate and the style is austere with bleached color photography (by Tom Stern) that could almost pass for black-and-white yet the feeling is intimate. This is a claustrophobic epic set mostly inside the elaborate network of caves and tunnels that the Japanese have dug in Iwo Jimas sandy hillsides. The Japanese soldiers arent depicted as anonymous Others but as men who might be but for their faces and uniforms -- and for their uncommon individuality -- the GIs and officers of American war movies. These fighting men like any others write letters to their mothers girlfriends and wives. Theyve been taught blind obedience to the emperor but their loyalty collides with their instinct for survival as they come to understand that theyre destined to die inside their caves. Some of the officers certainly qualify as fanatics but others who have lived in the U.S. and counted Americans as friends take a tragic view of their plight. They know they are doomed yet they fight furiously and heroically all the same. (As the islands commander Gen. Kuribayashi Ken Watanabe gives a performance thats commanding in every way -- taciturn fiery on occasion forthright yet self-effacing.) The view taken by Clint Eastwood directing from Iris Yamashitas exemplary screenplay is elegiac but -- and this is remarkable given the nature of the production and the sweep of his ambition -- not at all didactic. He lets the film speak for itself and so it does -- of humanity as well as primitive rage and horror on both sides of the battle. And the production as a whole ""Flags of Our Fathers"" together with ""Letters From Iwo Jima"" speaks more eloquently still -- of epic folly and shared tragedy of purblind imperatives and dire necessity. Just as usefully if not more so the two parts illuminate each other in intricate specific ways explaining why for instance a Japanese prisoner of war went berserk or what happened to a GI after he was taken captive. The sum of both parts is a war movie unlike any other.    Ya gotta do what ya gotta do as Rocky says in ""Rocky Balboa"" so I gotta admit that I had a pretty good time watching this 94th film in a series that started 30 years ago. The premise has the dual virtues of simplicity and preposterousness. Pushing 60 with a son who ignores him and not much to do but mourn the loss of his beloved wife Adrian Sylvester Stallones Italian Stallion lumbers back into the ring to do battle with the reigning world champion a monstrously bemuscled creature Mason ""The Line"" Dixon who is played by Antonio Tarver. ENLARGE Sylvester Stallone reprises his role as a boxing underdog in Rocky Balboa Why does he do it? Rocky has always been a champion of self-realization and hes at it again insisting on his right to be beaten to a bloody pulp by a 32-year-old. ""Whats crazy about standing toe to toe and saying I am?"" he asks rhetorically and Hemingwayesquely. How he gets to do it is another story -- the preposterous one -- that starts with a computer simulation pitting Dixon against Rocky in his prime. Soon Rocky is back in training accompanied by his old triumphal music. ""Rocky Balboa"" is without beating the point to a pulp erratically made. Various characters -- including Burt Youngs frazzled soul-sick Paulie -- suffer from seizures of speechifying. A subplot about a single mother and her son loses track of the boys reluctant bonding with Rocky and his son. Yet the mother played by Geraldine Hughes is an attractive foil for the battered ex-pug who tells charmingly repetitive tales of his exploits to diners at Adrians the neighborhood restaurant he owns. And you cant help being moved by the overlap between the indomitable boxer and the unquenchable actor. The same goes for the climactic bout some of which is shot in an ecstatic black-and-white style that evokes ""Raging Bull."" Against all odds this panoply of punishment is almost thrilling even though its raging bull of a different kind.    ""Venus"" is a love story in which one of the lovers -- the young Venus of the title -- first sees the much older man Maurice as an alien life form. She does recognize that hes alive however and she soon finds life in delightful abundance since the ardent old coot is played by Peter OToole. ENLARGE Peter OTooles Maurice is smitten with Jodie Whittakers Jessie in Venus. Hes wonderful in the role though fans of Mr. OToole who still think of him as the eerily beautiful Lawrence of Arabia may first be stunned to see him here sans makeup or vanity. His Maurice is an aging actor with a haunted visage a reedy voice a watery gaze a lurching gait and a precarious lease on life. Maurice may be short of breath but he is still long on longing. So hes instantly smitten -- besotted is a better word -- by the trashy grand-niece of his best friend Ian who arrives in London from the provinces to work as Ians caregiver. (Her name is Jessie though Maurice calls her Venus and shes played by a flagrantly talented newcomer named Jodie Whittaker.) The subtext of the film which Roger Michell directed from a screenplay by Hanif Kureishi is mortality but the text is the jubilant dissonance between Maurice and Venus. He is fragile and terribly vulnerable though insistently self-ironic. She is vulgar insensitive and sometimes cruel. Still they blossom in each others presence and theyre not the only attractions either. Ian another creaky thespian is played by Leslie Phillips and Maurices ex-wife Valerie by Vanessa Redgrave. In other words ""Venus"" is awash in terrific performances.    In ""The Painted Veil"" which was directed by John Curran from a script by Ron Nyswaner terrific actors give glum performances. Edward Norton is Walter a middle-class English doctor who in 1920s London marries a mercurial upper-class beauty named Kitty (Naomi Watts) then takes her to China where he starts work as a bacteriologist and she quickly plunges into an affair. The generally brittle tone derives from the source material a novel by Somerset Maugham. (A movie of the same name starred Herbert Marshall and Greta Garbo in 1934 and was remade in 1957 as ""The Seventh Sin."") Still the particular brand of glumness is the result of choices I find truly mysterious. Why would the movies co-stars who were also its producers choose to play their unhappily married characters with such relentless dedication to repression and rigidity? They do open up toward the end but by then its too late for us to relate to anything but the scenery. The scenery is impressive -- first Shanghai in the mid-1920s then a remote Chinese village struck by a cholera epidemic. Yet its mainly a backdrop for long scenes of lacerating hostility between Walter who is punishing his wife with passive-aggressive silence while he struggles to stem the epidemic and Kitty who finds herself doing solitary penance with no evident hope of redemption. Im oversimplifying of course but not by much even though their situation finally changes if not entirely for the better. During those long stretches of emotional stasis the movie plays like ""No Love in the Time of Cholera.""    DVD tip ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" (1949) gave John Wayne one of his quintessential roles Sgt. John Stryker a tough-as-nails Marine turning raw recruits into fighting men. Though the film is very much a part of its time -- a time when a film like Clint Eastwoods was beyond imagining -- Wayne is at his most appealing and the use of combat footage is impressive. The flag-raising sequence includes three of the real-life flag raisers whose stories were at the center of ""Flags of Our Fathers"" Rene Gagnon Ira Hayes and John Bradley. --Read Mr. Morgensterns column every Friday in Weekend Journal Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Rocky Balboa Wins This Round washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Rocky Balboa Wins This Round In his corner Sylvester Stallone gets back in the ring for the sixth film in the ""Rocky"" series. (By John Bramley -- Mgm Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday December 20 2006 Who asked for this? Another ""Rocky"" sequel in which we learn once again that the Italian Stallion has too much heart to ever give up? But in ""Rocky Balboa"" the sixth and latest installment theres Sylvester Stallone again sucking down raw eggs and pounding sides of beef to train for another prime-time bout. His opponent this time heavyweight champ and insufferable braggart Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (real-life boxer Antonio Tarver) whos got something to prove. Sportswriters call him a chump who never really fought a tough contender. No one like that old warhorse Rocky Balboa. Old is right. Stallone creator and perennial star of what has become a 30-year franchise is 60. He ought to be reaching for his AARP card not his boxing gloves. As much as most of us loved 1976s ""Rocky"" which took three Oscars including Best Picture just as many groaned through the sequels that followed. Remember 1985s ""Rocky IV"" with the already aging Rocky up against a steroidal Soviet named Ivan? Or ""Rocky V"" the 1990 film in which Rocky was so punch-drunk he mistook his wife Adrian for his former boxing coach? As a pop-culture hero Rocky was down and out -- or so it seemed. And yet . . . and yet . . . this critic found himself sitting there in the darkened theater rooting for this movie to work. Just one last time. The odds seemed impossible -- just like Rockys. There were reports of moviegoers hooting at previews. And sitting in the middle of fellow movie critics the bloodlust felt palpable. One false move on the screen -- a moment of insufferable vanity a misfired attempt at poignancy -- would be enough to knock this flick to the canvas. Watching ""Rocky Balboa"" suddenly felt like a tussle between old-time sentimentality and postmodern derision. The verdict? There were titters yes. But to this viewer sentimentality won by a knockout. ""Rocky Balboa"" comes out swinging as soon as the ""Rocky"" theme blares from the speakers -- that portentous anthem that has most of us picturing Philadelphias First Citizen at the top of the steps of the Museum of Art arms aloft. But ""Rocky Balboa"" which brings back Burt Young (the irascible brother-in-law Paulie whos a few knuckle hairs shy of Cro-Magnon when he drinks) but not Talia Shire (Adrian is dearly departed alas) doesnt rest lazily on its own nostalgia. Written and directed by Stallone it smartly reprises the atmosphere of Hollywoods yesteryear when pug-ugly heroes played by Spencer Tracy Robert Mitchum and Ernest Borgnine won audiences over with their burly souls. They had big chests square mugs and they talked common sense -- when they talked at all. They were sportswriters wrestlers gangsters and boxers. When they walked change jingled in their pockets. They saw things simply. They were working class -- or they came out of it. They were crude princes of the docks the slums the street and the screen. And thats Rocky with his slurry voice his porkpie hat and two pet turtles called Cuff and Link. Thats the guy who keeps an old chair nestled in the crook of a tree above Adrians grave so he can sit with her for hours. Hes the one who nurses the hurt of a grown son (Milo Ventimiglia) whos embarrassed by his sad-sack over-the-hill father. Hes the one whos reduced to sharing war stories with customers in the South Philly restaurant he owns. But hes no paragon of palooka virtue either. When some punks taunt him for instance Rocky walks over to those disrespectful hecklers and takes care of conflict resolution the old way. A guy like this needs to fight. Then comes the opportunity to prove his mettle an ESPN computer-simulated match that suggests the old-timer might give Mason a run for his money. Cue the crowds the trash-talking the early-morning workouts and that glorious walk to the ring. In Vegas. Ten rounds. Mano a mano. But it feels like the first fight all over again. And suddenly a silly little movie built entirely on classic hokum seems to matter. Not just because its one last roundhouse punch at the world of digital zeros and ones. Not just because its another underdog story. It matters because this boxer taps into something deeper in our collective souls than the desire for entertainment. Its the hope that one day were going to win big too after everyones given up on us. Its as hokey as its true. Rocky Balboa (102 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for boxing violence and minor profanity.

"Stallone and Rocky Balboa stagger to final bell in sentimental last round - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Punchless yet poignant Stallone and Rocky stagger to final bell in sentimental sequel 60-year-old Stallone is back in ring as 50-year-old Rocky. (JOHN BRAMLEY/MGM VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  December 20 2006 Theres probably a psychological term for obsessively returning to key moments of ones past seeking renewed relevance and an illusion of youth.For todays purposes lets just call it ""Rocky Balboa.""The sixth entry in the on-again/off-again saga of the Pug from Philly -- arriving 16 years after ""Rocky V"" -- is a surprisingly quiet affair for much of its running time. It harks back to the marble-mouth  proto-indie neighborhood sensibilities of the original 1976 ""Rocky"" before the series got hooked on steroids and went Hollywood. Like its hero the movie is endearing clumsy and mawkish and its joints creak alarmingly.As nostalgic as this may be its probably necessary for no one but the man who made it. ""Rocky Balboa"" is about a 50-year-old boxers last shot at glory but it clearly represents the 60-year-old Sylvester Stallones attempt to climb back in the ring after a career that has dwindled into inconsequence in the past decade.Can you blame him for resurrecting his signature character? Where most aging jocks dust off their trophies Stallone dusts off his training montage the beef-carcass punching bag the run up the museum steps. Its shameless heartening and fairly sad; the cinematic equivalent of a toupee that doesnt convince.The law of sequels requiring one sacrifice per installment everyone from the first ""Rocky"" is dead now except for the title character (Stallone) and his pal Paulie (Burt Young). This doesnt stop the ghost of Adrian from floating through played by Talia Shire in sepia-tone clips from the earlier movies or Rocky from tending her grave religiously. (That business about the crippling brain damage in ""Rocky V""? Fuhgeddaboudit .)Rocky runs a successful restaurant named after his dead wife; every night he poses for pictures and tells old stories. Philadelphians hail the Italian Stallion on the street but also take him for granted Hes a beloved cartoon. This chafes his yuppie son Rocky Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia) embarrassed of his pop and tired of living in his shadow and it bugs Rocky too.Its a fertile subject for a movie -- the vanity and anxieties of an aging athlete -- but ""Rocky Balboa"" wants no part of it. Instead the hero decides to start training again spurred by a much-discussed computer simulation on TV that pits a young digital Rocky against current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver). The bout shows Balboa winning and sometimes thats all an old man needs to start dreaming.Rockys appearance before the local boxing commission allows Stallone to write and perform one of the movies Big Monologues about self-respect; like so much here its simultaneously noble and ridiculous. Much better are the scenes in which Rocky sort-of romances a single-mom bartender (Geraldine Hughes).Stallone knows his ""Marty"" and ""On the Waterfront"" ready-mades and these sequences have a gentle and genuine humor.Dont ask how but ""Rocky Balboa"" works its way up to an exhibition match between the aging lion and the young champ a brassy Las Vegas affair with the crowd primed once again to cheer the underdog. Rocky has no knees no speed he cant spar; his only recourse to quote one character is ""good old-fashioned blunt force trauma."" Which is a pretty good description of the last third of the movie.The first two rounds of the fight are taut and coherent but then Stallone and editor Sean Albertson lose their grip throwing every ""Raging Bull"" cutting-room trick at us in an endless undifferentiated welter of images. Its a desperation move and it reveals ""Rocky Balboa"" as the wishful fantasy it is.This is no corporate project made to squeeze a few more dollars from a fading cash cow. No one else has been asking for another ""Rocky"" other than maybe Burt Young . No this is a rarer beast -- an auteur sequel -- and its so wrapped up in its makers personal mythology and psychic needs that it becomes a hall of mirrors to which were given a slack-jawed ringside seat.The parallels between Rocky and Sly are everywhere whenever Rocks son scoffs ""People will think youre crazy -- what are you trying to prove?"" or when the old boy himself grumbles ""Theres still some stuff in the basement."" This may be the first meta-movie for mooks. ""Rocky Balboa"" isnt a response to Stallones late-life crisis it is his late-life crisis right up there on the screen. And if it doesnt do the trick well ""Rambo IV"" is in the works for 2008. No fooling. Can somebody break it to Sly that we all know its a toupee?Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"`Rocky offers self-parody <a href=""http//chinadaily.allyes.com/main/adfclick?user=ChinaDailyNetwork|UltimatePage|Ultimate_top_banneramp;db=chinadaily""></a> ENTERTAINMENT / Review `Rocky offers self-parody By CHRISTY LEMIRE (AP) Updated 2006-12-19 0852 Sylvester Stallone star of the film Rocky Balboa is seen before a premiere of the film in Philadelphia Monday Dec. 18 2006. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) ""Rocky Balboa"" the sixth (and hopefully last) installment in the underdog saga of the Italian Stallion straddles the line between nostalgia and self-parody and frequently teeters toward the latter. Returning to his roots Sylvester Stallone writes directs and stars once again as the iconic title character who long ago retired from boxing and now has carved out a quiet life as a South Philly celebrity and restaurant owner. He mourns the loss of his beloved Adrian who died of cancer and still hangs out with her loudmouth brother Paulie (Burt Young). ( Talia Shire appears in flashbacks at moments that ostensibly were meant to be inspiring but instead just feel clunky.) But when an ESPN computer simulator pits him in his prime against the current heavyweight champion Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (retired light heavyweight champ Antonio Tarver) Rocky gets the bug for that tried-and-true one last fight. No one thinks he should do it - not his son Robert Jr. ( Milo Ventimiglia) whos bitter about the burden of having famous blood run through his veins and certainly not the media who have a ball bashing Rocky before he even sets foot in the ring. This would be an example of art imitating life - or is it the other way around? The idea of yet another ""Rocky"" movie writes its own punch lines and Stallone deserves some credit for being aware of this phenomenon and having enough confidence in himself not to care. And there is a certain allure to the ritual of revisiting the character a comfort in the familiarity. Hes mellowed a bit now as he wanders about town incapable of walking down the street without being approached for an autograph yet he continues to spew those overly simplistic Rockyisms in that rumble of a voice that sounds like hes gargling with marbles. (""You know you learn a lot talking to dogs"" is among the funniest.) He and Paulie still have that spirited banter in which neither seems to be listening to the other and hes added a new friend a shy single mom he knew as a girl from the neighborhood whom he still affectionately calls Little Marie (Geraldine Hughes) who comes to work as the hostess at his restaurant. But then when the inevitable training montage begins to the swelling strains of ""Gonna Fly Now"" its all so hard to take seriously after all this time. He does everything you expect to see him do - he lifts hulking metal chains and kegs of beer jabs and hooks those giant slabs of meat before running triumphantly up the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art- and does it all with heart. Lest we forget as he prepares to get his butt beaten by a man half his age we are repeatedly reminded of the comparative enormity of Rockys heart. Tarvers character meanwhile is merely impudent and pampered - so poorly fleshed out its hard to care about him at all much less fear or loathe him. It makes you long for the broad charms of Mr. T. But lets be honest Was anyone (besides Stallone) really curious to see how Rocky might turn out at age 60? He is in massively muscular fabulous shape - truly a specimen to behold at any age !a and maybe thats the point after all. Stallone says he wanted to close out the franchise with a sense of satisfaction after the bomb that was ""Rocky V"" in 1990. But maybe he also wanted to stand there covered in fake blood and sweat wrapped in a silk robe and revel in the warm glow of having an entire arena full of extras chant ""Rocky Rocky"" one more time. Back in 1976 it all seemed so inspiring; the original ""Rocky"" was a small gem that became the surprise best-picture Oscar winner. In 2006 though ""Rocky Balboa"" merely feels like a shameless vanity project. ""Rocky Balboa"" an MGM Pictures release is rated PG for boxing violence and some language. Running time 98 minutes.

The time away from the ring has done Rocky and the franchise some good although it takes pic a good long while to gather momentum and clout before a surprisingly satisfying third-act heavyweight bout. After having seemingly been put out to pasture for good the Italian Stallion returns after a 16-year hiatus for yet another comeback in ""Rocky Balboa."" The time away from the ring has done Rocky and the franchise some good although it takes pic a good long while to gather momentum and clout before a surprisingly satisfying third-act heavyweight bout. Absence has fostered a certain fondness toward Stallones mythic underdog that will translate into solid if not quite K.O. B.O. through the holidays with fine vid tourneys to follow in 07. The long stretch away from the ring for Phillys favorite son -- and for Stallone as director its been a full 21 years since ""Rocky IV"" -- has allowed a certain coursecorrection toward the grimier small-scale sensibility of the 1976 original helmed by John Avildsen. The title itself eschewing the increasingly risible Roman numerals denotes a change required after Avildsens bloated ""Rocky V"" even as certain aspects of previous entrys storyline have been conveniently or oddly ignored in Stallones script. Even before the movie catches up with Rockys personal life it wastes no time establishing what every boxing fan knows The heavyweight division is mired in mediocrity with Mason ""the Line"" Dixon (played by ex-light heavyweight champ Antonio Tarver) alone at the top and unable to scrounge up a meaningful competitor in his division. Unlike most of Rockys past opponents Dixon is seen as a pro without peer unluckily fighting during the sports lowest ebb. Where pic runs into early trouble is with Rocky himself whos mourning the loss of wife Adrian (once played by Talia Shire seen here in a few brief soundless memory images). Felled by cancer five years before Adrian lives on as a kind of ghost with her name still on the restaurant Rocky runs like a party host. Whether in scenes opposite Burt Young (reprising Adrians meatpacker brother Paulie) or with his son Robert Jr. (played not by Stallones son Sage but by the unimpressive Milo Ventimiglia) Stallones 60-year-old Rocky exhaustingly plays exhaustion and early sections slog along. It hardly helps that Rocky and Paulie sometimes resembling Beckett characters if they were goombahs endlessly muse about how ""the whole world is fallin apart"" but without a deeper sense of loss and regret. The screenplay never knows exactly what to do with Robert Jr. a young man in the corporate world whose repeated complaints that hes living in Rockys shadow come off as whiny and shallow. The ex-champs standard of living an issue in ""Rocky V"" is confused here since on one hand he lives in the same beat-up Philly digs of yore yet owns and manages Adrians restaurant where business appears to be thriving. The most interesting aspect of ""Rocky Balboa"" is how it considers the ways in which television has utterly transformed the sports world. A mock match rendered in computer animation and pitting Rocky vs. Dixon sets off a flurry of debate (ESPN regular Skip Bayless cracks that Rockys specialty in the ring should be ""pounded chicken"") that generates interest in staging the real thing. Thus plot hinges on hype generated by a cable channel -- an all-too-credible scenario in contempo sports. It awakens Rocky and Stallone to new possibilities. To Robert Jr.s horror dad wants to fight again and Rockys barkeep friend Marie (Geraldine Hughes) ends up supporting his new impossible dream. In scripts worst stroke of creative amnesia Rockys brain damage in previous pic is utterly ignored as if it had vanished into thin air. Even an initial rejection by the Pennsylvania boxing commission cant stop Rocky from meeting Dixon in a lavish exhibition match in Vegas. Final build toward the bout is handled with real pleasure by Stallone and editor Sean Albertson effortlessly tossing in several iconic ""Rocky"" movie images -- from the egg drink to the raw-meat punching bag -- that work as celebration rather than self-parody. Match itself is remarkable for being largely staged and shot like an actual HBO pay-per-view event from lensing in HD to HBOs Jim Lampley (with Larry Merchant and Max Kellerman) doing the play-by-play. Without Hughes solid blue-collar humanity as Marie pics first half would be pure drudgery and the fact that Rocky and Marie show no sexual sparks enhances their scenes emotional clarity. Youngs Paulie feels tired and dull while Tarver is shrewdly asked to play a close version of himself. James Francis Kelly III as the African-American son of Marie (whos Anglo) is introd with much fanfare and then given little to do -- or may have had his part trimmed in the editing room. Though Stallone directs with little visual inspiration outside the ring sequence he sticks to the originals up-from-the-streets spirit and rejects the slickness that had crept into the franchise. He also leaves no doubt in the final shot that this is the end of the Rocky saga. Capper is a lighthearted montage over closing credits of everyday folks running up the Philadelphia museum steps a la their hero.

Sylvester Stallone already had one go at resurrecting his most beloved character as a creaky years-beyond-his-prime has-been in Rocky V and no one gave much of a damn then. So why should we care about Rocky again? It turns out that the added years only benefit the character making him seem touchingly new because hes so old. In Rocky Balboa Rocky fast approaching AARP status (Stallone turned 60 this year) is in his late Jake La Motta phase -- hes a droopy shambling relic with calcified joints who runs an Italian eatery entertaining customers with boxing tales they already know by heart. Since hes famous we arent asked to feel sorry for him (even as he moons over his late beloved Adrian) and damned if Stallone doesnt tap right back into the Rocky charm -- the soft-brained lug logic and slurry nobility the feeling enhanced by his meat-locker bulk that hes a caveman simpleton who knows only how to fight. He gets his chance when ESPN runs a simulated bout between Rocky and the current champ Mason ""The Line"" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) and the prospect of a cross-generational exhibition fight becomes a Vegas media jackpot. There is much to poke at in Rocky Balboa yet the movie with its amusingly updated ""Gonna Fly Now"" montage and its very niftily staged climactic bout summons just enough incredulous wit about just how often Rocky has been around this particular block to let Sylvester Stallone earn his nostalgia.
