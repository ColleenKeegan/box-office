Another boring and cliche-riddled bid to join the young adult market already overpopulated by X-Men Hunger Games Twilight vampires and interminable hordes of rampaging zombies The 5th Wave is a typical example of the kind of dopey junk that passes for literature among todays unsophisticated teens who know everything about J. K. Rowling and nothing at all about Jane Austen. They must write book reports from Classics Illustrated comics. THE FIFTH WAVE (0/4 stars) Written by Susannah Grant Akiva Goldsmith and Jeff Pinker Directed by J Blakeson Starring Chloe Grace Moretz Matthew Zuk and Gabriela Lopez Running time 112 min. Based on a trilogy of preposterous YA novels by fantasy writer Rick Yancey The 5th Wave has mediocre direction by somebody called J Blakeson a few good special effects worth seeing but not discussing in any kind of meaningful detail and a monotonous script by three human word processors who should remain nameless (although one of them Susannah Grant wrote Erin Brockovich and therefore knows better). The narrative in this time-waster is both familiar and forgettable its the usual routine of bad music and the challenges of the next Saturday night prom until an alien space ship arrives unleashing a killer virus in the form of five shock waves the purpose of which is to destroy the human race. The first four waves have already wiped out whole cities (great shots of empty Manhattan streets filled with flood water and going down for the count). The only survivors are teenagers clinging to cell phones and bottled water whose lives are whipped into shape when they are forced into unisex boot camps to defend themselves against the alien invasion. The protagonist is a girl named Cassie (played by the talented Chloe Grace Moretz who already paid her dues as the star of the Carrie remake and deserves better). She already lost her parents to the virus and now with the fifth wave on its way she spends the rest of the movie trying to find and save her younger brother and his teddy bear narrating her thoughts in a corny combination of flashbacks and diary entries that evoke guffaws. In the mess that ensues the wasted grownups include Liev Schreiber Maria Bello and Ron Livingston while Cassie is joined by two potential boyfriends with bigger roles--Ben (Nick Robinson) a fearless high school classmate and Evan (Alex Roe) a handsome alien robot who has taken the form of a human ""host."" Neither of these characters exist to move the story from one point to the next but to serve the sole purpose of reminding the viewer that there are two more 5th Wave installments on the way in which a romantic triangle will undeniably develop. Drugs radiation surgery--nothing works to rid the body of alien hosts once they establish squatters rights in the human body. They are called ""others."" In the fifth wave they will survive like cockroaches. Who will save Cassie? ""You make me want to be human again"" sighs the besotted Evan. ""Whats the point of any of this?"" asks Cassie. I kept hoping but no such luck. Its a question that is never answered.

Comments (1) click to enlarge The 5th Wave Video Rated PG-13  114 minutes  2016 Chloe Grace Moretz is a plucky teen outwitting extraterrestrials in this sci-fi thriller based on Rick Yanceys eponymous novel. Unfortunately the premise holds more excitement than its execution which amounts to a lazy patchwork of themes from various young-adult dystopian franchises. Separated from her family during a series of coordinated alien attacks Moretzs character goes on the run to save her kid brother (Zackary Arthur) and eventually confront ""the Others"" with the help of a sensitive hunk (Alex Roe) and an army of child soldiers who look as if theyve been recruited from the set of Divergent. Director J. Blakeson injects some suspense into the edgier first half but the potential for this adolescent Independence Day to transcend mediocrity is ultimately squashed by a silly and generic love triangle that makes The Hunger Games look like Casablanca.

"5th Wave The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 5th-wave-the ) 5th Wave The (United States 2016) January 26 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli The 5th Wave is an adaptation of Rick Yanceys 2013 YA sci-fi novel. Although many recent multi-book YA properties have made successful book-to-screen translations (The Hunger Games Divergent The Maze Runner) The 5th Wave is a departure from this trend. The storyline is generic apocalyptic science fiction and feels a lot like an uninspired fusion of Independence Day and the TV mini-series ""V"". Trying to cram too much material into about 100 minutes the filmmakers lose control of the narrative as snowballing contrivances become difficult to ignore. And because this is the first chapter of a planned trilogy were left with a tepid ending that teases future installments that may never be made. By all accounts the book holds together better and its not hard to see how that could be the case. Many of the problems with The 5th Wave feel like the result of an adaptation that would rather condense than prune. Details are left out that might make the plot gel and wouldnt demand a high degree of suspension of disbelief. For stretches The 5th Wave is sporadically entertaining but its frustrating as well because of the logical holes and incomplete ending. Its hard to envision The 5th Wave with its unfavorable release date and limited marketing generating enough of a box office return to prod Sony into greenlighting a sequel and this movie does not stand well on its own. The 5th Wave spends about a half-hour at the outset providing background about an alien invasion. This as it turns out is by far the most interesting and successful part of the movie. The extraterrestrial incursion occurs in waves. In Wave 1 a giant alien ship enters orbit and after hanging around for a while hits the planet with an EMP. In Wave 2 the ship triggers worldwide tsunamis that destroy coastal cities. Wave 3 is a plague that wipes out most of the remaining population. In Wave 4 the aliens land snipers to pick off survivors. This all leads to Wave 5 which at least as presented in the film is an unnecessarily convoluted campaign for a species possessing the technology to accomplish what this one has achieved in the previous waves. Maybe the book explains it better... The film follows the travails of two main characters indomitable high school student Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) and her would-be boyfriend football player Ben Parish a.k.a. ""Zombie"" (Nick Robinson). Cassie loses her mother (Maggie Siff) during Wave 3 and her father (Ron Livingston) during Wave 4. Her 5-year old brother Sam (Zackary Arthur) is taken to a military safe haven under the command of Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) and Sergeant Reznik (Maria Bello). There Sam meets Zombie and becomes part of his squad. Meanwhile Cassie is injured while searching for her brother. She is nursed back to health by a stranger Evan Walker (Alex Roe) with whom she begins a relationship. Evan agrees to accompany her to the military base to find Sam but as she learns along the way all is not as it seems with this Good Samaritan. Although The 5th Wave provides resolution to some plot elements it leaves numerous threads dangling. The alien ""Others"" have a plan and purpose but aside from a need for Earth the reason for the invasion isnt revealed.  Additionally its unclear whether the Others look like humans or whether Body Snatchers-style they are inhabiting human hosts (or mimicking human bodies). The psychology physiology and motivations of the aliens dont seem well thought-out but that could be something that the screenwriters were unable or unwilling to translate from the source material. Like all YA novels this one involves a love triangle. Or considering hints that a tough goth girl named Ringer (Maika Monroe) is doing her best to hide an attraction for Zombie maybe that should be a ""love quadrangle.""  In part because theyre not given sufficient time to organically develop and in part because the dialogue is pretty bad the romantic entanglements feel forced. One characters monologue about love is so lame that its hard to keep from laughing aloud at its absurdity. When The 5th Wave was optioned it was almost certainly viewed as a property with Hunger Games potential. Most comparisons between the two franchises however tilt against The 5th Wave. The situation isnt as compelling. The romances lack intensity. And although lead actress Chloe Grace Moretz has been effective in other action-oriented roles (as Hit-Girl in Kick Ass and its sequel for example) she seems miscast here. With a movie version of (sequel) The Infinite Sea in doubt there seems to be little reason to see The 5th Wave unless youre a fan of unfinished stories that likely will never be completed. 5th Wave The (United States 2016) Director J Blakeson Cast ChloA<< Grace Moretz Nick Robinson Alex Roe Ron Livingston Maggie Siff Maria Bello Liev Schreiber Maika Monroe Screenplay Susannah Grant Akiva Goldsman Jeff Pinkner based on the novel by Rick Yancey Cinematography Enrique Chediak Music Henry Jackman U.S. Distributor Columbia Pictures Run Time 152 U.S. Release Date 2016-01-22 MPAA Rating ""PG-13"" (Violence Profanity Sexual Content) Genre Science Fiction/Adventure Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Aliens (1986) Interstellar (2014) Star Wars A New Hope (1977) worse movies of this genre After Earth (2013) Sound of Thunder A (2005) Earth to Echo (2014) Three...better movies of ChloA<< Grace Moretz (There are no more better movies of ChloA<< Grace Moretz) worse movies of ChloA<< Grace Moretz Neighbors 2 Sorority Rising (2016) Amityville Horror The (2005) Clouds of Sils Maria The (2015) Three...better movies of Nick Robinson Jurassic World (2015) (There are no more better movies of Nick Robinson) worse movies of Nick Robinson Kings of Summer The (2013) (There are no more worst movies of Nick Robinson) Three...better movies of Alex Roe (There are no more better movies of Alex Roe) worse movies of Alex Roe (There are no more worst movies of Alex Roe) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/5th-wave-the,200,the5thwave2,the5thwave,reelviews

By Anthony Lane Natalie Portman and Joel Edgerton in a showdown out West.   Credit Illustration by Bill Bragg The title character in ""Jane Got a Gun"" is Jane Hammond (Natalie Portman) who lives with her young daughter in the New Mexico Territory. The year is 1871. Jane has a husband Bill (Noah Emmerich) who has been gone awhile; now he returns half dead with bullets in his back. He tells her that he has tangled with ""the Bishop boys"" who are coming to exact revenge. The sensible course of action at this point would be for Jane to get out of there like a jackrabbit. Being more cussed than sensible however she stands her ground--farming the child out to a friend for safekeeping then hunkering down to fortify the homestead and to prepare for attack. As watchers of Westerns we know what to expect next. A stranger should ride to the rescue; in short we need a Shane. One reason for the endurance of George Stevenss film from 1953 is the supreme equipoise that it finds between two contending impulses--the will to wander moving restlessly through a desert land versus the urge to take root battling for your right to settle down and defying those who would snatch it away. If ""Shane"" is to be believed the region was peopled with Van Heflins and mysteriously saved by Alan Ladds. The last filmmaker to demonstrate an instinctive grasp of that balance is Clint Eastwood in films such as ""Pale Rider."" There he played Preacher who like Bill Hammond had gunshot wounds in his back. You kept wondering if he might be the ghost of a cowboy--the very last word in wanderers. The director of ""Jane Got a Gun"" is Gavin OConnor who inches toward the tensions that come so naturally to Eastwood. But the film takes a curious step to one side. The bed-bound Bill is useless to Jane so she looks for assistance elsewhere recruiting a former beau named Dan Frost (Joel Edgerton) whom she left years before and who has never quite recovered from the jilt. Instead of the Man with No Name we get the Grumpy Old Flame. ""I need a gunslinger"" she says. ""You need a goddam regiment"" he replies before offering to do the job himself. You can feel Edgerton striving manfully to strop his character into toughness. Hell Dan is so rugged that chickens roam his living room and anxious homeowners will wish to study his master class in how to make your own booby traps--get a jar of vegetables tip out the contents fill it with kerosene add a soupcon of rusty nails and glass shards and then lay it tenderly in a trench. But that practical groundwork is undone I regret to say by a scene from an earlier time in which Dan and Jane take a summer stroll through a field of swaying crops and exchange moony simpers as if suddenly gripped by the desire to advertise a multigrain cereal. This was not how the West was won. Nor is that the only flashback. One caption tells us that we are now in ""Huntsville Missouri 1864"" and helpfully adds ""Seven years before"" in case we cant do the math. Bit by bit we piece together the history of Jane how she left Dan joined a wagon train fell afoul of varmints and was cruelly used before Bill came to her aid. From the plotting two things emerge. First this movie is in part a retread of ""Hannie Caulder"" (1971) in which Raquel Welch suffered no less bruising a fate and took equally strong steps to correct it. I wasnt sure about the allusion until the latter stages of Janes adventures when she wears her hair long and loose and tops it with the same style of hat that was sported--more dashingly it must be said--by Welch. ""Hannie Caulder"" is no masterpiece but there is a gusto to its supporting cast that blows the new film away like dust Robert Culp Ernest Borgnine (of course) as the scowler-in-chief and rather less predictable Christopher Lee as a gunsmith. The only figure in ""Jane Got a Gun"" who comes within yards of that intensity is John Bishop the boss of the marauders who has black hair oddly matched with pale eyes and a lick of politeness in his brutish soul. It took me a while to realize that crouching behind the thicket of mustache was none other than Ewan McGregor. The second revelation as the tale unfolds is that the unfolding is in fact a collapse. The backstory muddles rather than clarifies the front end and the long wait for the climax is more of a dawdle than a ratcheting up. When the shootout finally arrived with gunfire peppering the darkness I sat up straight as if an alarm clock had gone off. As for the aftermath it suggests that the scriptwriters--Anthony Tambakis Brian Duffield and Edgerton himself--had scribbled random twists onto scraps of paper tossed them into a bucket shut their eyes and plucked. Be not amazed. Since ""Jane Got a Gun"" was shot in 2013 it has become a byword for the thousand comical shocks that the industry is heir to. Lynne Ramsay the original director left the project. Edgerton was set to play not Dan Frost but John Bishop a role that was then passed from Jude Law to Bradley Cooper before landing in McGregors lap. Its a miracle you might argue that the film has crawled onto our screens at all yet there have been countless hits whose birth pangs were similarly fraught. What do Frank Sinatra John Wayne Burt Lancaster Robert Mitchum Paul Newman and Steve McQueen have in common? Each was approached for the Eastwood role in ""Dirty Harry."" As the Bishop gang looms by night Jane declares ""Whatever happens Im going to put my face to it."" Brave words but can a face as famously beautiful as Portmans ever show the weathering of such peril or the scars of a hardscrabble life? Well yes. It certainly did in ""Cold Mountain"" where she played a lonely widow in a secluded shack and which she stole in a few brief scenes--shooting down a fleeing soldier and weeping at the touch of a hand. Somehow ""Jane Got a Gun"" fails to be scuffed by that sense of desperation just as it forgets to cast an eye on the yawning spaces and enormous skies that we associate with the genre. I never even managed to sort out the geographical basics such as how far it is by horse between the characters dwellings. When Jane pops over to Dans place shes like Phoebe in ""Friends"" going to see if Chandler and Joey are in. Then theres the weaponry. As titles go ""Jane Got a Gun"" has a slangy punch but the fact is that when Jane got a gun she wasnt no good with the gun she got. So she got another gun. No matter how many guns she got though she got no satisfaction. In truth she should have got another line of work. Put the evidence together and its no surprise that this poor little movie fires blanks. It never wanted to be a Western at all. The premise of ""The Fifth Wave"" is that our world is being taken over by aliens. Like chefs deciding on a tasting menu they organize and phase their plan with exquisite care. In the first wave they switch off the planets electrical power--a feat to be warmly applauded since most of the major characters are teen-agers or younger and only a complete shutdown will force them to abandon their cell phones. ""Nice phone case"" is the snappy line with which Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) ""a totally normal high-school girl"" from Ohio greets a boy she has a crush on. His name is Ben (Nick Robinson) though his friends call him Zombie. The second wave is a wave--a Biblical deluge triggered by an earthquake that sends Cassie and her young brother Sam (Zackary Arthur) scrambling into a tree. ""What it must be like nearer the ocean I can only imagine"" Cassie says. Wrong. Only imagining is the one thing that no blockbuster buff with digital muscle would ever demand of us and we are duly treated to the sight of Londons Tower Bridge and other global landmarks being swept aside. The third wave is avian flu now fatal to humans and the fourth involves aliens who enter our bodies without permission squatting undetected and denying us the ability to work out who is what. ""Why dont they just get it over with?"" Cassie asks displaying a spooky ability to read my mind. The fifth wave is anyones guess. The film is directed by J. Blakeson and adapted--though perhaps not adapted enough--from the novel by Rick Yancey. In other words we are in the belly of young-adult fiction a marketing wheeze dressed up as an art form and stupendously summarized in the movie by the image of Cassie hurrying through the woods carrying both an assault rifle and a Teddy bear. The clever hook is that kids who cannot be wormed into by the enemy must be trained and armed to kill the grownups who can. The whole thing appears to have been designed by some crazed Oedipal wing of the N.R.A. And what are the aliens known as? The Others. I rest my case.

"The 5th Wave - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire The 5th Wave Posted by Christy Lemire on January 24 2016 2 Comments Sony Pictures Rated PG-13 for violence and destruction some sci-fi thematic elements language and brief teen partying. Running time 112 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. ""The 5th Wave"" plays like a Wayans-brothers spoof of movies based on dystopian Young Adult novels. Seriously it could have been called ""YA Movie"" the way it wallows in all the overly familiar tropes of the genre. Theaters could offer checklists at the door to allow us to play along and at least have a little fun with it. Lets see we have -- An apocalypse that decimates the planet (this time aliens are to blame). -- A plucky teenage girl who dares to think for herself and defy the odds (Chloe Grace Moretz). -- Two hunky potential suitors competing for her affections (Nick Robinson and Alex Roe). -- Adults in control who are clearly untrustworthy played by serious actors to give the film some semblance of heft (Liev Schreiber and Maria Bello). -- An intense training ritual in which kids learn how to become killers complete with hand-to-hand combat and firing-range exercises. -- A maze. Seriously theres a maze of concrete corridors these kids must navigate in order to escape. If this sounds familiar to you  -- if youve seen any or all of the movies in the ""Hunger Games"" ""Divergent"" or ""Maze Runner"" series -- then you know exactly what youre in for with ""The 5th Wave."" Theres even an ending to suggest hopes for a franchise of its own. Rick Yancey who wrote the book ""The 5th Wave"" also wrote a sequel ""The Infinite Sea."" The third installment in the trilogy ""The Last Star"" is due out later this year. Because they all come in trilogies. Thats something you should be familiar with by now too. Having said that Moretz is game for all the physical and psychological mayhem that come her characters way and she clearly aims to add depth to this person which might not have existed on the page. Director J Blakeson working from a script credited to some heavy-hitting veteran writers (Akiva Goldsman Susannah Grant and Jeff Pinkner) quickly establishes that Moretzs Cassie used to be a pretty average teenage girl in an idyllic Ohio town soccer practice keggers a wisecracking best friend an adorable younger brother (Zackary Arthur) and loving parents (Ron Livingston and Maggie Siff). But then ... the aliens come. Who are they? What do they want? Doesnt matter although context might provide some actual tension and fear. Just know that they arrive hover and wreak havoc in a series of waves a devastating electromagnetic pulse followed by earthquakes and tsunamis (with tidal wave effects that look pretty cheesy) then an avian flu then snipers I think ...? People get shot. (My 6-year-old son whos sitting next to me as I write this just asked ""Why are there five waves? Why dont the aliens just do it all in one?"" Its a legitimate question.) Anyway the fifth wave is coming. And the military (which suspiciously has working vehicles and dramatic overhead lighting out of ""Dr. Strangelove"") needs children to help fight the battle. The cute football player Cassie had a crush on before the arrival of The Others as the aliens become known is among their most promising soldiers Robinsons Ben Parish whose code name is Zombie. The groups other bad-ass is a fierce young woman known as Ringer (Maika Monroe from the great ""It Follows"") who somehow finds time each day to apply thick black eyeliner even though the world could end at any moment. Cassies story runs parallel as she struggles to find her brother Sam whom the military has taken to an air force base for tiny soldier training. For a regular and rather sheltered girl she figures out how to use a high-powered rifle and hide in the wilderness pretty quickly. (And her hair always looks amazing.) She also happens to get rescued by the handsomest farm boy imaginable Roes Evan Walker. There are many moments in ""The 5th Wave"" that made me and my fellow critics giggle from the back row of the theater but the one that made us cackle hysterically occurred when Cassie stumbled upon Evan enjoying an early-morning bath in the river. As she surreptitiously spies on him from behind a tree he turns around to reveal ridiculously sculpted pecs and abs. Amid all the alien-hiding and girl-rescuing Evan clearly found time to hit the gym. The true enemy here isnt too difficult to discern. The massively versatile Schreiber who improves every film in which he appears cant do much with his under-written role as the commanding colonel calling the shots. But perhaps well learn more about him -- and come to truly fear him -- in the inevitable sequel.

Its like fill in the blanks where you can just change the actors name and you have a movie review. Kudos for being a professional who takes your job seriously so that we the gentiles dont have to sit through these nonsense of movies. Happy movie goings. Reply January 24 2016  by  Green Eggs and Ham     I think this is a very bold review of your points. While I myself dont agree with them I respect this point of view. I however do not think you should be speaking so negatively on the books amp; authors. It is not necessary if youre just reviewing the movies. Movies and books are completely different entities. In the book community trilogies are common and almost expected. I dont understand why there was a complaint on that behalf. Otherwise I respect your bold views on the movie.

Photo Credit Sony Pictures / Chuck Zlotnick advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW The 5th WavePLOT When aliens invade Earth a teenage girl struggles to survive.CAST Chloe Grace Moretz Nick Robinson Alex Roe.LENGTH 152.PLAYING AT Area theaters.BOTTOM LINE A fast-paced and surprisingly intense entry in the young-adult sci-fi genre but too late to the game to feel fresh. PG-13 (strong action and violence) ""When youre in high school every day feels like the end of the world"" says Cassie Sullivan the heroine of ""The 5th Wave."" When a giant spacecraft begins working its way across the sky and methodically killing everyone Cassie realizes that it isnt the world ending -- its her species. Thats the premise of this post-apocalypse sci-fi adventure film the first in a possible franchise based on Rick Yanceys acclaimed novels. That series launched in 2013 which seems eons ago in the timeline of the young-adult fiction craze. Since then weve seen the end of ""The Hunger Games"" and the launch of both the ""Divergent"" and ""Maze Runner"" series to name only the most successful examples.

Any movie wading into this crowded territory had better offer something new. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviewsMore coverageRafer Guzmans latest ""The 5th Wave"" doesnt which is too bad considering how well-made it is. Its fast-paced surprisingly intense and capably acted by a young cast led by Chloe Grace Moretz as Cassie a carefree teenager whose life suddenly becomes unfathomably dark. The invasion by aliens nicknamed The Others arrives in ""waves"" including a power outage earthquakes and disease. Thanks to director J Blakeson these sequences are skillfully executed and feel grippingly real particularly the tsunami that overwhelms Thailand. (Its tough to enjoy that one given the 2004 tsunami that killed more than 5000 people there.) At any rate the death and destruction in ""The 5th Wave"" can be highly entertaining but once thats over the movie must follow its predetermined formula. advertisement | advertise on newsday That includes the slightly suspicious military leader Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) troops of kids training for combat (Maika Monroe plays Ringer a rebellious Goth girl) and the inevitable love triangle of Cassie her classmate Ben Parish (a likable Nick Robinson) and an alluring but mysterious hunk Evan Walker (Alex Roe very pretty). As ""The 5th Wave"" hits its required beats -- and stumbles through some slightly clumsy plotting -- a sense of young-adult fatigue sets in. Theres little to set Cassie apart from the many heroes who have come before her and her bleak new world functions in all-too-familiar ways. MoviesBest movies of 2015 Though better crafted than many movies in its genre ""The 5th Wave"" feels like a late arrival to a played-out game.

The 5th Wave Not even Chloe Grace Moretz can save this YA sci-fi flick from being a dystopian washout Chloe Grace Moretz in The 5th Wave.

I went of my own volition. Why? I actually read and fractionally liked the 2013 novel by Rick Yancey that put some muscle into yet another dystopian tale of teenagers facing the end of the world. The protagonist Cassie Sullivan is an independent Ohio high school student with the usual yen for boys but without the need for some dude to define her. I never moved on to the next book in Yanceys trilogy 2014s The Infinite Sea (the third The Last Star is due later this year) but there was something in The 5th Wave that seemed salvageable when and if the book made it to the big screen. I was wrong. More News 25 Reasons We Loved the Movies in 2015 The Top 20 Sci-Fi Films of the 21st Century Why Katniss Everdeen and Arya Stark Are the New Role Models All Stories >> Related 40 Best YA Novels Beloved favorites underground classics controversial page-turners sci-fi sagas and more Despite the strong presence of Kick-Ass star Chloe Grace Moretz as Cassie the movie is selling the same old YA yada yada yada that made phenoms of Twilight and Divergent. You know the story of how a plucky girl must conform to a pecking order that puts global annihilation behind deciding between two hot guys -- the football hero (Nick Robinson) or the stranger in the woods (Alex Roe). What a shame. Moretz seems ready to rumble. Working from a screenplay by Susannah Grant Akiva Goldsman and Alex Pinkner director J Blakeson (The Disappearance of Alice Creed)  doesnt dwaddle setting up the premise. By that I mean whats a girl to do when an alien spaceship starts hovering over her suburban street? Thats a cue for the aliens called ""The Others"" to start with their waves. No. 1 turns off the power. No. 2  brings on earthquakes. No. 3 decimates with a virus. No. 4 involves the Others taking human form to finish off any survivors. And No. 5 is the final battle the one that drags the movie down into a quicksand of cliches. Parental guidance gets squeezed when her mom (Maggie Siff so good on Billions) and dad (Ron Livingston so wasted here) are quickly dispatched and Cassie must  protect her kid brother (Zackary Arthur). She thinks she doesnt need help. But the script says she does from the quarterback and the stranger. Liev Schreiber and Maria Bello show up as military types. But the only standout in the cast besides Moretz is Maika Monroe (It Follows) as a Goth fighter with no patience for pussies. Jeez if only Monroe and Mortez had been allowed to take over the movie. Instead The 5th Wave is another dystopian washout. Topics Chloe Grace Moretz Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Photo Columbia Pictures ""Pumpkin theres nothing safe anymore."" Thats what calmly downcast Oliver Sullivan (Ron Livingston) tells his teenage daughter Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) partway through the new young-adult dystopian sci-fi The 5th Wave and its a good example of the kind of very thin deadly line the film tries to walk. Its a movie not just about losing ones innocence (thats what all YA books and movies are about these days) but about soft centers and hard shells -- about the cute colliding with the cruel. That ""pumpkin"" makes the line ridiculous but its also the word that sells the overall conceit of a seeming lyordinary girls life being transformed forever. A lot of YA stories focus on characters who were outcasts or outsiders to begin with (Katniss in The Hunger Games being a prime example). Cassie as she makes clear in The 5th Waves opening narration was a middle-class high-schooler playing soccer and going to parties and texting with her BFF and lusting secretly after hunky football players before the mysterious giant alien ships started hovering above Earth. Then the power went out tidal waves wiped out half of humanity and bird flu took care of the rest. When we first see Cassie in the film (before she flashes back to life as it was) she kills a bleeding man who seems to be reaching for a gun; it turns out to be a cross. Thats a hell of a thing starting your movie with your fresh-faced teenage heroine killing an innocent wounded man. ""I miss the Cassie I was"" she tells us. ""I wonder what that Cassie would think of me now. The Cassie who kills."" For its first half-hour or so The 5th Wave admirably conveys the contrast between the warm nostalgic light of Cassies innocence and the absurdist catastrophes that befell her and humanity. Soccer practice is interrupted by buzzing phones alerting the kids and coaches to the giant ships in the sky. The ensuing apocalypse is evocative We see Londons Tower Bridge demolished by a tidal wave; a young man stands on a terrace watching Manhattan consumed by brackish water. Characters are dismissed with grim efficiency; Cassie is quickly pulled away from her best friend as the girls look at each other from across a quarantine fence. But gradually we lose the thread as the world of the film begins to feel forced and cagey like important information is being awkwardly kept away from us. The aliens called ""the Others"" are unseen mysterious which lends them a symbolic quality. Children including Cassies young brother Sam and her secret crush Ben Parrish (Nick Robinson) are rounded up and turned into soldiers by a group of military hard-asses led by Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber) and Sergeant Reznick (Maria Bello). Its like Lord of the Flies by way of Michael Bay only not nearly as awesome as that sounds. There is pointed symbolism all over the place but director J Blakeson and his screenwriters (which includeA Erin Brockovichs Susannah Grant and A Beautiful Minds Akiva Goldsman) havent managed to balance such thematic elements with the films clunky attempts at action and romance. Nor have they built on the storys allegorical overtones For much of the film we feel as if were watching an elaborate metaphor that hasnt been thought through entirely. (Its possible that the best-selling novel written by Rick Yancey explains this stuff a bit better.) But then things go from disappointing to laughable. Major characters are dispatched in rushed and unconvincing fashion as if whole plot threads have been cut out. At one point near the end one character shows up with what will now forever be one of my favorite lines in cinema ""Ive been planting bombs."" I hope Im not giving anything away (nor do I care) when I say that this sets us up for a comically explosive finale -- one that were it not for that ridiculously convenient virtually context-free bit of stray dialogue would be coming out of nowhere. For all the goodwill generated by its early scenes by the time The 5th Wave lumbers to its conclusion you realize youre not watching a movie but an act of crisis management.

Face it if youve read one best-selling young-adult trilogy about the dystopian future youve read them all. Start with a world facing some sort of existential crisis. Populate it with clueless or evil adults and one smart brave teen girl. Maybe give her a kid sibling she cares about. Definitely give her two boys (one sweet and sensitive one hunky and dangerous) to choose between. Then designate her as the worlds savior. Now churn out three books (knowing that Hollywood will end up stretching them out into four films) and sit back knowing that if youre the author the money will roll in. And sit back knowing that if youre the audience it doesnt matter much if you doze off because youve seen it all before. Certainly there is nothing new in ""The 5th Wave"" the latest young-adult wannabe franchise starring Chloe Grace Moretz as our bella heroine Cassie a divergent beauty running through the woods with the mockingjays - only with a gun instead of a bow. In this fill-in-the-blanks adventure its aliens who are taking over the planet and Cassie who will oppose them -- helping lead (at least by the end of this first installment) a small tribe of young rebels comprising sweet and sensitive boy dangerous hunk and adorable baby sibling (along with those other guaranteed one-note characters Edgy Rival Girl and Probably Doomed Ethnic Kid). Yet much as it resembles its models ""The 5th Wave"" doesnt have the total emotional commitment of the ""Twilight"" stories or the occasional social criticism of the ""Hunger Games"" saga. In fact its a little soft -- and in its details a trifle silly. The alien invasion for example has to be the worst ever. The title you see refers to its stages -- so far The Others (as theyre called) have attacked us with electromagnetic pulses tsunami pandemics and armed soldiers. Now theyre ready for the ""Fifth Wave."" This is of course not only slightly confusing (how exactly did they create a tidal wave in Lake Erie?) but time-consuming. Theyre infinitely superior extraterrestrials. They cant just blanket us with a deathray? Or create a truly fail-proof virus? Why waste time with all this nonsense? Is the Chief of Earth Invasion Operations being paid by the hour? I swear you look a little closer guaranteed youre gonna find no-bid contracts no-show jobs and some alien with a pinkie ring. But really -- why would you look a little closer at ""The 5th Wave""? Chloe Grace Moretz is a better actress than shes given credit for (and almost always better than her material) but she has no edge no grit; even here living in the post-apocalyptic wilds she seems to have a secret stash of leave-in conditioner. True old pros Liev Schreiber and a tough-as-gel-nails Maria Bello add some weight to things. And if youre keeping track while most of the other franchises mostly push the same liberal viewpoint (conformity is control sectionalism is manufactured) this takes a fresher more conservative view (hold onto your assault rifles dont trust the government). There are also hints of grown-up complications -- as several of our heroes acting out of fear or ignorance actually kill innocent characters. But the whole thing is just so familiar so warmed-over. I understand being attracted to books in the same genre but it feels as if the YA-dystopian-world genre only has one book -- with just a few spaces left blank to fill in different proper nouns and adjectives. And thats not literature. Thats Mad Libs. Ratings note The film contains violence sexual situations and underage drinking. The 5th Wave (PG-13) Sony (112 min.) Directed by J Blakeson.

Blakeson Written by Susannah Grant Akiva Goldsman Jeff Pinkner Starring Chloe Grace Moretz Nick Robinson Liev Schreiber Classification PG Country USA Language English Except to surf enthusiasts dreaded things come in waves violence heat Star Wars sequels nausea etc.Likewise in The 5th Wave a disappointing film formulaically adapted from Rick Yanceys engaging young-adult novel we have unseen aliens dubbed ""Others"" invading Earth in a series of frightfully disabling stages that precede the sci-fi survival thrillers titular fifth thing. An electromagnetic pulse deadens a planet; a tsunami has London bridges falling down; a virus spreads cataclysmically; half-human/half-aliens hunt down survivors. How Chloe Grace Moretz barely escaped injury making The 5th Wave (AP Video) Survivors such as teenage Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) the storys coming-of-age protagonist whose bee-stung lips tremble in the face of hunky boys and apocalypses but who discovers an inner Jennifer Lawrence - shes a real Hunger Games baller - to fight a plot-twisting war as she seeks her tiny brother one of the children conscripted into military service.Topical ideas on humanity mistrust and alien-as-immigrant metaphors are a plus but a laughable romance and a ridiculous wrap-up render the film as only a staging ground for the next two parts of the trilogy to come. Although waves dont have to be bad this unambitious first one is ominous.

Look at ""The 5th Wave."" After ""The Hunger Games"" ""Divergent"" and ""The Maze Runner"" series have jammed multiplexes in recent years ""The 5th Wave"" indeed feels like the fifth wave of book-to-screen adaptations of end-of-the-world stories aimed at young adults.And ""The 5th Wave"" -- based on Rick Yanceys novels -- is definitely warmed-over material cobbled together from the pieces of those previously mentioned sagas. Add in a little inter-species romance a la ""Twilight"" and ""The 5th Wave"" has all the makings of a genre parody if only it had that much of a sense of humor about itself.It stars Chloe Grace Moretz as Cassie Sullivan a self-described ""totally normal high school girl"" whos biggest problem is the crush she harbors on Ben Parish (""The Kings of Summers"" Nick Robinson). But when an alien spacecraft starts hovering in the sky above her Ohio hometown things get real.These ""galactic party crashers"" initiate a series of events or ""waves"" to annihilate humankind beginning with an electromagnetic pulse that wipes out the worlds power. Next up are the floods triggered by a string of tidal waves that destroy the worlds coastal cities (and true to disaster movie form we get to see them take out important world landmarks; bye bye Londons Tower Bridge).So far so good and director J Blakeson stages these early scenes with the right mix of terror and uncertainty. Next up on the aliens hit list is a modified bird flu which is followed by the invasion of the aliens who conveniently take the form of humans. Around this time the military shows up led by Colonel Vosch (Liev Schreiber). He enlists an army of teenagers to take out the aliens which is around the time ""The 5th Wave"" sinks like a stone.As the storyline toggles between Cassies quest for survival and the army plot the teenage schmaltz bubbles over the top. After getting shot in the leg on an abandoned highway Cassie is taken in by Evan Walker (Alex Roe) a hunk in a Henley shirt who nurses her back to health. Meanwhile Cassies baby brother Sam (Zackary Arthur) is training to be a soldier in a squadron that includes Ben (now known as ""Zombie"") and ""Ringer"" (a raven-haired Maika Monroe unrecognizable from ""The Guest"" and ""It Follows"") a no-nonsense feminist warrior who chides her fellow cadets ""no demeaning sexist remarks""Meanwhile the end of the world is merely a backdrop for Cassie to make goo-goo eyes at Evan and a scene where she catches him bathing in a lake is straight out of the teen movie playbook. Human extinction is no match for teenage hormones it seems.And as Sam remembers the good times on Earth by reciting Coldplay ballads ""The 5th Wave"" falls further into camp territory. A climactic race to rescue Sam from the clutches of alien forces takes a backseat to an introduction of a love triangle between Cassie Evan and Ben. Later this admission from Ben ""I was named after Ben amp; Jerrys. Nothing made my dad happier than ice cream.""And so it is. ""The 5th Wave"" starts off strong but winds up drowning in young adult cliches. Its not the end of the world but its starting to feel like the end of this genre.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaThe 5th WaveGRADE CRated PG-13 for violence and destruction some sci-fi thematic elements language and brief teen partyingRunning time 112 minutes 19 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1VcEPFG MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/01/22/movie-review-teen-drama-eclipses-worlds-end-th-wave/79146496/,200,the5thwave12,the5thwave,detroitnews
"5th Wave review Chloe Grace Moretz juggles romance post-apocalyptic dystopia - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The 5th Wave review Chloe Grace Moretz juggles romance apocalyptic dystopia The 5th Wave Chuck Zlotnick / AP Alex Roe left as Evan Walker and Chloe Grace Moretz as Cassie Sullivan in a scene from ""The 5th Wave."" Alex Roe left as Evan Walker and Chloe Grace Moretz as Cassie Sullivan in a scene from ""The 5th Wave."" (Chuck Zlotnick / AP) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Between ""The Hunger Games"" the ""Divergent"" trilogy and the other dystopian apocalyptic teens-in-luv adventures adapted for the movies these last few years is there room on whats left of the planet for ""The 5th Wave""?Maybe; probably. The movie isnt bad. Director J Blakeson (""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"") keeps the screws relatively tight and maintains a reasonably effective level of dread buoyed by the usual cautious dys-lit Young Adult romance (one can-do female protagonist torn between two smitten fellas). The Rick Yancey book of the same name published in 2013 was the first in a trilogy. So if ""The 5th Wave"" is a hit therell be plenty of time to answer this question Can Chloe Grace Moretz learn how to convincingly portray a character who looks like shes going through anything rougher than a skip down Rodeo Drive? Moretz can be a sharp and surprising actress (see ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" for proof) and she has successfully transitioned from busy child performer to busy young adult. But she needs to work on her flinty Clint-y side if shes going to pursue this role through more movies or pursue similar terrain in other movies.Here the scenario allows her a standard-issue reluctant-action-heroine list of chores. Carry a machine gun check. Run through woods look like you mean it check. Change bloodied bandage on upper thigh after bullet wound with help from hunky farm boy check. Some context. Complete sentences not required. Sentence fragments and phrases fine.Alien invasion. Mass earthquakes and flooding. Avian flu. Billions killed. Interestingly stark mood in early scenes.Survivors survive. Cassie played by Moretz. U.S. Army arrives led by Liev Schreiber. Seems off somehow. Discussion of unseen but widespread aliens who inhabit ordinary citizens. Cassie separated from her brother played by Zackary Arthur. Ron Livingston plays dad. Child soldiers trained to combat the invading aliens aka the ""Others.""Farm boy (Alex Roe) sends Cassie into a ninny-dither by bathing in lake without a shirt. Alien invasion proceeds despite Roes shirtlessness and the additional sexual tension (theoretical) provided by Cassies high school crush (Nick Robinson playing a squad leader tasked with alien-killin).

Watch in Times Video >> embed When the kid brother of Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) an Ohio teenager is whisked away to a military outpost she resolves to reclaim him with help from the hunky mysterious Evan (Alex Roe). At the same time her high school crush Ben (Nick Robinson of ""Jurassic World"") is groomed to lead a squad of child and teenage commandos (including the delightfully astringent Maika Monroe from ""It Follows"" in goth eye shadow) in fighting the Others. Or so they are instructed by an imperious colonel (Liev Schreiber) and sergeant (an uglified Maria Bello).Ben Cassie and Evan converge at the base in an awkward meeting that segues into a remarkably unclimactic climax. Its depressing to see Ms. Moretz -- so spirited in ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" and the ""Kick-Ass"" movies -- reduced to constant mooning at Mr. Roe. And yet the source novel is part of a trilogy. Expect sequels. ""The 5th Wave"" is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned) for violence child soldiers and teenage partying.

"Review Aliens attack story logic in The 5th Wave but the destruction looks cool - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review When aliens attack in The 5th Wave logic is obliterated but the destruction looks cool 5th Wave Review Chuck Zlotnick / Sony Pictures Chloe Grace Moretz in ""The 5th Wave."" Chloe Grace Moretz in ""The 5th Wave."" (Chuck Zlotnick / Sony Pictures) Gary Goldstein Its the end of the world as we know it -- yet again -- in ""The 5th Wave"" a largely silly sci-fi action-thriller with a wobbly narrative based on the bestselling young adult novel by Rick Yancey. With two subsequent books in the series can a movie franchise be far behind? Lets hope not.A landlocked Ohio suburb is apparently the Earths safest place after an ill-defined alien invasion wreaks havoc on every island and coastal spot on the globe. The mayhem comes in waves an electromagnetic pulse wipes out the worlds power and water supply earthquakes beget disastrous tsunamis avian flu spreads like wildfire and aliens undetectably start occupying human bodies. See more of Entertainments top stories on Facebook gt;gt;But its that pesky ""5th wave"" that surviving Buckeyes must prepare to battle -- if they can only figure out whats coming their way. To that end a ""Soylent Green is people""-type revelation provides fleeting intrigue and a few twists. But its insufficiently mined in the clunky script by Susannah Grant (""Erin Brockovich"") Akiva Goldsman (""A Beautiful Mind"") and Jeff Pinkner (""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"").

See more videos At the epicenter is Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) an average high school student with loving parents (Ron Livingston Maggie Siff) an adoring kid brother Sam (Zackary Arthur) and a crush on dreamy classmate Ben (Nick Robinson).However when the aliens strike and tragedy hits home Cassie remarkably turns all teen-Terminator -- one slapdash lesson in guns and shes good to go. Cassies soon tearing through the local rubble in search of little Sam from whom shes become separated in a predictable scene involving a forgotten teddy bear.Meanwhile the no-nonsense Col. Vosch (Liev Schreiber) and his even tougher second Col. Reznik (a nearly unrecognizable Maria Bello) draft bands of young folks -- including Sam Ben and the hostile Ringer (Maika Monroe) -- to undergo military-style training to combat the aliens or ""the others.""

In what seems a separate universe shes rescued from injury by a startlingly good-looking farm boy Evan (Alex Roe) who becomes her kind of guardian angel. But can she trust him? Enough it seems to propel an unconvincing romance with the well-armed hunk. These parallel story lines finally intersect but in a way thats far-fetched facile and a bit anticlimactic despite some bone-cracking action. To the movies credit it contains several eye-popping scenes of alien-inspired devastation and it eschews dystopian tropes for a more intimate reality-based setting.But director J Blakeson cant quite maintain the films momentum while squaring its disparate parts malleable story rules (werent all power sources destroyed?) hokey dialogue and a crisscross of often one-note emotions. Still undemanding teens may buy its message of youthful empowerment.------------The 5th WaveMPAA rating PG-13 for violence and destruction some sci-fi thematic elements language and brief teen partyingRunning time 1 hour 52 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on January 22 2016 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""Teens fight aliens but cant halt storys destruction - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Entertainment Movies Reviews Chloe Grace Moretz Maria Bello Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-5th-wave-review-20160122-story.html#nt=outfit,200,the5thwave15,the5thwave,latimes

The resounding answer is also simple and emphatic ""HELL NO"" This American movie is wretchedly written and badly directed and edited. Despite being handsome on occasion-- especially in woodland sequences with dappled sunlight -- it is not just about a disaster on Planet Earth it is a disaster for Planet Hollywood. The awkward leap from page to screen has been clumsily handled. Even the movies young star -- the soon-to-be 19 Chloe Grace Moretz as feisty heroine Cassie Sullivan -- is weighed down with stupidly juvenile dialogue. Even worse she is forced to cast smouldering but embarrassing glances over the bodies of her leading men Nick Robinson as Ben Parrish (aka Zombie) and Alex Roe as the mysterious Evan Walker. One scene with Walker bathing topless in a lake and Moretz sneaking longing looks at his six-pack torso is laughable (bursts of derisive mirth resounded throughout my advance screening). So even with her best efforts that robs Moretz of her opportunity to compete in the same dystopian feminist heroine league as Jennifer Lawrence who played Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games series. Instead Moretz is locked in a third-rate imitation game. Far more interesting is the dynamic of demented femme heroine Ringer played with gusto by Maika Monroe. She needs more screen time (and may get it in the future after audiences see her in this summers Independence Day Resurgence). Like The Hunger Games The 5th Wave is intended as a young adult franchise designed to appeal beyond its core audience. Rick Yanceys first 5th Wave novel in an intended trilogy was published to great acclaim in 2013. Book two The Infinite Sea followed in 2014. The Last Star is set for release on May 24 just about when The 5th Wave should be freshly available on home entertainment. The 5th Wave clearly ends on an open-ended basis with the ""promise"" of sequels. Whether or not they are actually filmed may depend on the box office results for movie one. Fans of the first novel might and should be bitter over the odd changes to the storyline and especially to the way English director J Blakeson has watered down the violence and the consequences of the actions of both the flawed heroes and the relentless evil-doers. The movie is a sanitized nearly bloodless version of an alien apocalypse initiated by the unemotional cruelty of The Others and the chaotic response of humanity. Despite the fact that 99% of human beings are wiped out by the time of the 5th wave of attacks the movie makes it seem like a small-scale problem in a localized area in mid-America. Plus the key romantic stuff gives the story more of a Romeo amp; Juliet amp; blah-blah-blah feel than a true apocalypse that has emotional weight beyond the sci-fi special effects. Discredit goes to the three waves of credited screenwriters -- Jeff Pinkner Oscar-winning wordsmith Akiva Goldsman and Oscar-nominated veteran Susannah Grant. Director Blakeson added to the misery by directing in such a ""naive"" manner that every major plot point and ""surprise"" twist in the action is obvious regardless of whether you have read Yanceys book or not. Chief among those problems are the cases of the military commander and his hard-ass sidekick played by Liev Schreiber and Maria Bello. But fussing about that is secondary. The biggest problem is surviving The 5th Wave as a movie.

Share Tweet What this ongoing YA adaptation cycle of dystopian and post-apocalyptic killer-teen movies really needs is a Starship Troopers a film that could put the lie to the genre by exaggerating it into pitch-black poker-faced satire. What it gets instead is The 5th Wave a kids-trained-to-kill sci-fi flick that turns mildly subversive right before taking a headlong dive into sub-Twilight soap complete with a conflicted super-human dreamboat. Based on a bestseller by Rick Yancey--the first in a planned trilogy of course--The 5th Wave at least deserves kudos for finding the least enticing future setting possible central Ohio some time after the Earth has been attacked by aliens who dont look like anything and dont even have cool spaceships. These are the end times of the survivalist imagination where the last good people wear flannel and tote jugs of potable water with rifles over their shoulders avoiding strangers and military round-ups. Chloe Grace Moretz stars as Cassie Sullivan; once an ordinary teen who would spend her time having totally natural conversations about Sony smartphones and properties (Spider-Man count two) she is now on her own hiding outside Cincinnati from the surveillance drones of an alien invasion force. These aliens (dubbed ""the Others"") have avoided those big ""humanitys last stand"" land and air battles that alien invaders always suck at instead opting to severely reduce the planets population by knocking out electronics and communications creating artificial tsunamis and giving everyone the flu among other things. This is one of the more efficient and thought-out alien invasions in film and one of the cheapest to visualize which is a boon because The 5th Wave seems to have had a severely limited effects budget.What appears to be left of the American military is holed up at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base training kids and teens--including Cassies younger brother Sammy (Zackary Arthur) and her school crush Ben (Nick Robinson) now known respectively as ""Nugget"" and ""Zombie""--in advance of the presumably action-packed final step of the Others invasion plan. Even by the standards of the genre The 5th Wave initially seems grimly fatalistic; before the viewer learns Cassies name theyve seen her accidentally kill a man while raiding a gas station for tampons. But like everything mildly interesting about The 5th Wave that whiff of edginess is canceled out by the arrival of a teen-romance hunk hilariously out-of-place in the movies hardscrabble Midwestern no mans land. Aside from a taste for Visual Storytelling 101 basics (a close-up of a dropped teddy bear held for what seems like half a minute) British director J Blakeson (The Disappearance Of Alice Creed) doesnt do much to distinguish himself from any number of hired guns. This is the TV-pretty version of the end of the world with heroes who might not have access to medical supplies but seem to possess stockpiles of hair product and makeup. One cant help but think of the scene in Clouds Of Sils Maria where the Kristen Stewart and Juliette Binoche characters go to see a soapy teen sci-fi movie starring Moretzs troubled teen star. As parody Sils Marias film-within-the-film is totally unconvincing but any clip from The 5th Wave would have seemed spot-on.Moretz whos made her name playing everything but ordinary teens is miscast as a normal high schooler in extreme circumstances; perhaps Maika Monroe--Goth-ed up here in a second-tier role as the requisite badass--might have done better. (However Moretz manic emoting blesses The 5th Wave with the single goofiest slow-motion reaction shot in recent memory so thats something.) But credit should be given where its due Before its characters start yawping lines like ""Im human and Im Other Im both"" and having implied sex in abandoned station wagons--which come to think of it is a touching image of middle-class teens holding on to the last vestiges of suburban civilization--The 5th Wave manages to work its way to an easy-to-guess anti-authoritarian twist that fits the movies survivalist logic to a T but sets up a much better film than what follows. But isnt that the whole model of the dystopian teen franchise business? Promise them one ending and theyll pay for three books and four films.

The 5th Wave is just a Hunger Games wannabe review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe 5th Wave is just a Hunger Games wannabe review Based on Rick Yanceys three-part young adult series The 5th Wave tries and fails to pick up from The Hunger Games franchise.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Jan. 21 2016The 5 WaveStarring Chloe Grace Moretz Nick Robinson Alex Roe Liev Schreiber Maika Monroe and Maria Bello. Directed by J Blakeson. 111 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGEverything seems like the end of the world when youre a teenager The 5th Waves narrator and central figure Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) observes on her way to soccer practice.And then aliens show up and things get serious.Article Continued BelowBased on Rick Yanceys three-part young adult series The 5th Wave makes no secret of its lust to pick up from The Hunger Games and horn in on some of that dystopian Divergent teen love.Alex Roe and Chloe Grace Moretz star in The 5th Wave  (Chuck Zlotnick / Sony)  The first 20 minutes or so shows promise as Cassie outruns the successive waves of torment the aliens now called The Others blast Earth with in an effort to exterminate the population.Separated from home and family her younger brother sent off to a camp to be trained for an alien spotting and fighting force of kid commandos Cassie makes a brutal decision that shows her teen days are well behind her.The idea of training child soldiers to wipe out the invaders who are dealing with the remaining population by going creepily undercover has some story appeal but the predictable script doesnt hold up. Every plot point from the Katniss Everdeen playbook shows up. Theres the romance triangle with Nick Robinson as her school crush and Alex Roe as the older hunk who reinforces his appeal by stripping off for a swim. And then there are the deceitful adults with heinous agendas. Liev Schreiber and Maria Bello get the job done as U.S. army Col. Vosch and Sgt. Reznik who are determined to train up and squeeze loyalty out of the new kid recruits.Wed like to see a lot more of Maika Monroes teen solider Ringer an ass-kicking feminist who has a fondness for chess and no patience with fools. She makes Cassies perfect blond tresses and pouts seem somewhat ridiculous.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The movie opens in U.S. theaters on Friday. Alex Roe left as Evan Walker and Chloe Grace Moretz as Cassie Sullivan are shown in a scene from ""The Fifth Wave."" Related Facts The 5th Wave 1.5 out of 4 starsRated PG-13 for violence and destruction some sci-fi thematic elements language and brief teen partying.Running time 1 hour 52 minutes When the apocalypse happens all thats going to be left for us are the guns. Which might actually be true but is also the subtext of the dystopian young adult film hitting theaters this weekend ""The 5th Wave."" The film opens with a winsome blonde teen girl executing a man with a military-style assault rifle and the teen gunplay only goes further from there. The sight of teens with rifles is one were used to from news reports of a much more tragic nature so the imagery definitely gives one pause. Theres a deeply anti-government streak to the politics of ""The 5th Wave"" which imagines a world in which an alien race takes over the planet and starts eradicating the human species in a series of waves that destroy infrastructure environment and health. The panicked surviving humans band together in the woods until their children are rounded up by the army for ""protection."" Teen Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) escapes the collection and ends up alone in the woods with only a few guns for her comfort. She sets out to find her little brother Sam ostensibly to return his stuffed bear. Perhaps the reason why some of the themes and imagery hit a bit too close is the way the film creates a recognizable world. In young adult hits of the same genre such as ""The Hunger Games"" ""Divergent"" or ""The Maze Runner"" the metaphor has a bit more freedom because the worlds in which they take place are visually fantastical and therefore removed from our reality. Everything in the ""The 5th Wave"" feels or at least looks real. This could be an opportunity for a subversive and satirical text and at times ""The 5th Wave"" comes close to feeling like Paul Verhoevens great propaganda parody ""Starship Troopers"" particularly in the scenes of the young kids suiting up for battle - a small blonde girl in full tactical gear and a long rifle is just funny (or is it?). But this film is sorely lacking in irony - if there is any camp or humor to be found (and there is some) its mostly unintentional. Theres your to-be-expected love triangle with hunky loner lumberjack Evan Walker (Alex Roe) positioned against high school crush Ben Parish (Nick Robinson). The execution of said triangle is unfortunately generically laughable. Expository speeches are the technique of choice for writers Susannah Grant Akiva Goldsman and Jeff Pinkner who adapted Rick Yanceys novel. Not only does Cassie have a voice-over to explain things but characters dump information in rapid fire speeches filled with revelations of machinations that theyve put together awfully quickly. The twists and turns of the plot are telegraphed from miles away so theres not an ounce of suspense. The filmmaking itself (the film is directed by J Blakeson) is aesthetically pleasing enough and the story clips along at a fair pace. Moretz is a charismatic actor but her performance here is fairly standard-issue. Maria Bello relishes a chance to chew scenery as one of the manipulative Army sergeants while Liev Schreiber phones it in for a paycheck as the colonel. On the surface ""The 5th Wave"" is mindlessly silly enough but has a weirdly virulent pro-gun libertarian streak just under the surface. But really havent teens always been the true libertarians?

Chuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Chuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures Chloe Grace Moretz and Nick Robinson star in Columbia Pictures ""The 5th Wave."" Chuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures In 2014s Clouds of Sils Maria Chloe Grace Moretz plays a talented young tabloid magnet picked to star in a revival of a classy play alongside Juliette Binoches weathered veteran actress. Moretzs character also headlines a silly effects-heavy teen blockbuster with sterile white backgrounds bright red wigs and faux-kinky leather getups. ""I could feel my brain cells dying one by one"" Binoche declares after viewing it. Her assistant attempts an impassioned argument for teen sci-fi as a vehicle for emotional truth (shes played by Kristen Stewart natch) but Binoche cant stop laughing long enough to listen. The 5th Wave is essentially the movie Binoche was watching. And if its tempting to dismiss her own... er dismissiveness as elitist and out-of-touch wait till youve seen the film. The Moretz showcase is an alien invasion tale a disaster movie a wartime allegory and a Nicholas Sparks romance all rolled into one. Its based on a 2013 novel by Rick Yancey and all those hodgepodge elements likely work better on the page our own Petra Mayer praised it as ""a grim and riveting read."" Squeezing so many moving parts into a single motion picture would be admirably economical if it didnt also feel so endless. At only 18 Moretz has an uncommonly captivating screen presence. Even when shes reacting to the world of the film shes forcing it to orbit around her. That serves her well here as director J Blakeson (who last helmed the 2009 crime film The Disappearance of Alice Creed) does little but ask Moretz to react to CGI threats in the not-quite-near distance. i Chloe Grace Moretz Zachary Arthur and Nick Robinson in Columbia Pictures ""The 5th Wave."" Chuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Chuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures Chloe Grace Moretz Zachary Arthur and Nick Robinson in Columbia Pictures ""The 5th Wave."" Chuck Zlotnick/Columbia Pictures The film pits Cassie a ""totally normal high school girl"" against an invading alien horde called The Others whom we never see up close. Their ship appears hovering in the sky one day like the spacecraft from District 9 and they set about mass extermination plans in the ""waves"" of the title technology shutdowns airborne illnesses etc. In a familiar ironic twist humankind has met a superior species that only wants to wipe them out. Other invading alien hordes could sue for plagiarism in intergalactic court. But it takes a long while for Cassie via her journal entries to explain each of these waves and still more time after that to establish her own storyline. At a refugee camp for survivors military men led by a stone-faced Liev Schreiber slaughter her father and cart her younger brother off to a training facility and while hunting them down she falls into the care of an astonishingly good-looking blue-eyed farm boy (Alex Roe) who mends her wounds while chopping firewood out back. Thats not even everything because Cassies high school crush (Nick Robinson so good in The Kings of Summer) is also at the military base and hes being made squad commander in a child army butting heads with a tough goth girl played by current horror queen Maika Monroe. Maria Bello hovers maliciously in the background with lipstick redder than Liza Minnellis in Cabaret instructing her impressionable youth on how to spot Others lurking inside the bodies of fellow humans. Storytelling is supposed to peel off the layers of an onion not keep slapping on new ones right? Somewhere buried in the humorless muckety-muck of all this exposition lies an intriguing stew of YA influences derivative though they may be the political parallels and distrustful authority of The Hunger Games the child-soldier morality tale of Enders Game the playtimes-over violence of a K.A. Applegate series. And squinting at the right times may reveal visual winks to The Birds and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. The films imagery finds a strange power on its own too as when Cassie spies her best friend in a quarantine ward or during a sudden cutaway to a Thailand business district about to be ravaged by a tidal wave (is this what they mean by ""global audience""?). But it soon becomes apparent that these spunky teens no matter how much they flirt with each other while brandishing firearms are only running themselves in circles. Without giving away too much know that Yancey has planned a trilogy of books and that the films three credited adapters include Akiva Goldsman--soon to be penning the next five waves of Transformers movies. Perhaps it was naive like Binoches fading screen queen in Sils Maria to walk into a probable teen franchise starter and expect things to make narrative sense or to find distinctive character-driven arcs or to be fun at all. But perhaps its OK to keep hoping for that better future where teen sci-fi is that vehicle for emotional truth no matter how many times alien baddies and their unnecessary mythologies try to wipe out the genre altogether.

(Chuck Zlotnick) Movie review Get ready for ""The 5th Wave"" aka ""Virtually Every Disaster/Sci-Fi/Young-Adult Dystopia Picture Youve Ever Seen in Your Whole Entire Life."" Rating 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer Hey there Movie lover Cmere. Draw near. Have we got a deal for you. For the mere inflation-swollen price of a single movie ticket you can gain admission to what amounts to a mini film festival. So step right up and get ready for ""The 5th Wave"" aka ""Virtually Every Disaster/Sci-Fi/Young-Adult Dystopia Picture Youve Ever Seen in Your Whole Entire Life"" Movie Review 1/2   The 5th Wave with Chloe Grace Moretz Nick Robinson Alex Roe Liev Schreiber Zackary Arthur. Directed by J Blakeson from a screenplay by Susannah Grant Akiva Goldsman and Jeff Pinkner based on a novel by Rick Yancey. 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence and destruction some sci-fi thematic elements language and brief teen partying. Several theaters. Gawk in awe at the giant alien mother ship a clone of the one from ""District 9"" hanging ominously over a panicked Earth. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Were talking disasters of biblical proportions globe-shattering earthquakes city-drowning tsunamis (even in Ohio for crying out loud) plague and fire. Each catastrophic occurrence is a wave of alien-manufactured woe. Good grief Didnt we see this in ""2012""? And ""San Andreas""? And ""Hereafter""? Yes yes and yes But wait Theres more. So much more. ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" is here with devious extraterrestrials taking over the bodies of hapless humans. Theyre among us but who are they? Who can we trust? Paranoia strikes deep. Here too is ""Insurgent"" mashed up with ""Enders Game"" as young kids get military training and automatic weapons to fight back against the unholy foe. ""The Hunger Games"" is present and accounted for also with a romantic triangle in which a feisty teen heroine feels torn between two hunky fellows with startlingly soulful eyes. We pause the action in the midst of a frantic chase so that she and one hunk can lock lips while the other hunk looks on abashed. Yes you have seen this all before every last bit of it. Well OK. This probably you havent seen feisty heroine schlepping through the apocalypse with an assault weapon in one hand and a teddy bear in the other. Her mission return that bear to her kid brother whos been abducted by the alien menaces. Frightened then fearless shot then saved hunted then heroic she never lets that bear get out of her sight. It gets almost as much screen time as the human characters who are played by Chloe Grace Moretz (the heroine) Nick Robinson and Alex Roe (the soulful hunks) Zackary Arthur (the kid brother) and Liev Schreiber (the main baddie). Adapting Rick Yanceys 2013 YA best-seller director J Blakeson and a trio of screenwriters bring nothing new to the party. And yet there will be a sequel. Like the ""Hunger Games"" and ""Divergent"" and ""Maze Runner"" movies ""The 5th Waves"" open-ended ending promises more to come as Yanceys novel is the first installment in a trilogy. And thats too bad because this picture stands as the best argument yet that the YA dystopia cycle has passed its sell-by date.

There are those that feature characters who dont seem to have seen the inside of a shower in years like 2009s resolutely grim The Road. And then there are those whose cast members look like theyve visited a hair salon as recently as that morning. The latter category is the one into which this adaptation of author Rick Yanceys trilogy-inaugurating 2013 YA novel very much falls. Chloe Grace Moretz stars as Cassie Sullivan who in the first--and most nerve-rending--scene shoots to death a wounded help-seeking man. Cassie we learn in a lengthy flashback sequence has been transformed from keg party-attending high schooler to rifle-toting paranoiac thanks to a series of humanity-endangering alien-induced ""waves""--like a souped-up strain of avian flu and also actual waves. Our newly orphaned heroine is trying to to find her younger brother Sam (Zackary Arthur) who has been recruited to an army of kids set up to battle humans under the control of the face-hugger-resembling extraterrestrials infesting their respective brains. Other members of that military force--which is under the command of Liev Schreibers no-nonsense Colonel Vosch--include Cassies high school crush (Nick Robinson) and a sort of goth-Rambo played by Maika Monroe from It Follows who steals the show on those too-rare occasions she makes an appearance. On the way to rescue her bro the lushly-coiffured Cassie has time to do a lot of journaling and to fall for Alex Roes standard issue farm-dwelling hunk. The frankly preposterous nature of the films setup is rendered slightly less so by a couple of second act reveals. But by then many viewers will have lost interest in a movie with a very high bodycount but a very small amount of grit either emotional or literal.

Photo Chuck Zlotnick/Sony/Columbia Pictures via AP MOVIE REVIEW The 5th Wave Running time 112 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence profanity). Like ""The 5th Wave"" I believe the children are our future. Unlike the movie I have trouble believing teens can be made to do their algebra homework without whining let alone instantly cohere into a precision army to repel an alien invasion. ""When youre in high school in Ohio everything feels like the end of the world"" says Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) a teen who will shortly experience something worse than losing an iPhone A flying saucer zaps everyone with an electromagnetic pulse unleashes tidal waves and a bird flu and sends aliens disguised as ordinary folks to infiltrate Earth. Even for Ohio that counts as a below-average day. Together with a cute boy (Nick Robinson) she has a crush on from school days and a random hunk (Alex Roe) who saves her from a sniper she must lead humanitys teen remnant to an ""Independence Day""-style showdown that this Dollar Tree blockbuster cant quite afford to stage. A problem with ""The 5th Wave"" adapted from Rick Yanceys best-selling young adult novel is that there is nothing scary in it -- unless you count the panic I felt when I realized my college classmate Ron Livingston is now old enough to play the dad of a movie lead. He and all the other adults get pushed aside by an Army colonel (Liev Schreiber who deserves better) as the kids trade banter learn to fight and swear revenge on ""the others"" as the aliens are known. The requisite kick-ass female Ringer (Maika Monroe) preserves the old ways by saying ""No demeaning sexist remarks"" Color me skeptical that chauvinist jokes are going to be much of an issue after an electromagnetic pulse wipes out all the worlds food and electricity or that with well-armed alien murderers lurking in the woods Cassie would fret that a cute boy read her journal. The undercaffeinated middle of the film consists of dopey twists slow-burning gazes and dialogue that aims for ""heartfelt"" but comes out ""unfortunate."" ""Loves not a trick its real"" were told. Save it to write in your besties yearbook. When its time for the bang-bang and blam-blam the script departs from its comfort zone and simply wills the battle to go the right way. ""Ive been planting bombs"" one kid offers. Oh so high explosives were left lying around like pinecones by a superior alien life force who then collectively turned their backs at their high-security facility? Kids today dont just want everything handed to them they expect that their movie heroes wont even have to break a sweat.

Like a bad orange this adaptation of the series-spawning novel by Rick Yancey lacks both juice and flavor. The film is being sold as science fiction but sometime around the point where the heroine spies on her hunky comrade-in-arms chopping wood (before displaying his chiseled torso in a lake) we realize that this is actually yet another terrible YA movie -- a genre thats reached such levels of audience exhaustion that you cant blame the marketers for trying to hide the truth. Had ""The 5th Wave"" mined the material for audacity humor or even just reckless adventure this might at least have been a mindlessly entertaining alternative to Oscar fare but instead its a tedious slog one designed to be a tentpole for an ongoing series that after 112 plodding minutes few would anticipate with anything but dread. (Not even the scattered unintentional laughs are enough to make schadenfreude fans line up for a second helping.) See Video Chloe Grace Moretz Has Her Last Normal Day Before Aliens Invade in New 5th Wave Trailer To its credit the lead character here is not a Chosen One Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) is a regular Ohio high schooler texting her friends and awkwardly flirting with football player Ben (Nick Robinson ""Jurassic World"") until the day that alien ships start appearing in the sky. Then come the waves of the invasion First theres an electromagnetic pulse that knocks out the power the motor vehicles and the running water. Then the rivers and oceans rise drowning a large segment of the populace. Finally a particularly nasty strain of bird flu that kills millions more. Cassie her brother Sammy (Zackary Arthur ""Transparent"") and dad Oliver (Ron Livingston) are living in a refugee camp when news of the fourth wave arrives; Army officer Vosch (Liev Schreiber) sweeps in with several truckloads of soldiers to inform everyone that the aliens are now assuming human form and that the children need to be whisked off to Wright-Patterson AFB about 50 miles away for processing and that their parents will join them shortly. (Buckeyes will appreciate the attention to Ohio geography although the film was shot in Georgia.) Also Read Can The Revenant Beat Back 3 Newcomers to Finally Top Box Office? Accidentally separated from her family Cassie must make her way through the devastated countryside (where any human could now be an invader in disguise) to find Sammy who has become part of a squad (which also includes Ben) of kid soldiers the Army is training to fight aliens. There is horror or satire to be mined from the sight of a bunch of 8- to-15-year-olds going through grueling physical and marksmanship training but director J Blakeson (""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"") never bothers; nor does he successfully bifurcate the story between the military goings-on and Cassies travels (and her blossoming relationship with the helpful Evan played by Tiger Beat-ready British actor Alex Roe). Also Read Chloe Grace Moretzs The Little Mermaid Flips for Director Rebecca Thomas (Exclusive) Its never a good sign when three prominent screenwriters each take a credited stab at adapting a best-seller and Susannah Grant (""The Soloist"") Akiva Goldsman (""Winters Tale"") and Jeff Pinkner (""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"") so excessively telegraph each plot twist that the entire script may well have been written in Morse code. Any surprises that inattentive viewers might miss in the screenplay get put in blaring italics by composer Henry Jackman (""Captain America The Winter Soldier"") whose score works itself into a lather at the slightest provocation. Moretz for her part remains such an empathetic and direct young actress that she keeps Cassie grounded and interesting even when the plot goes a-wandering. As usual in YA movies the notable adults (who also include Maria Bello and Maggie Siff) essentially phone it in -- although who can blame Schreiber for wanting to save his energy for something like ""Spotlight"" instead? Email Sundance 2016 13 Breakout Stars to Watch From Parker Sawyers to Lily-Rose Depp (Photos) Tika Sumpter and Parker Sawyers ""Southside With You"" - Richard Tannes drama chronicles the epic first date of Barack Obama and Michelle Robinson across Chicagos South Side in the summer of 1989. This could be Sumpters breakout feature role and while Sawyers doesnt have a U.S. agent heading into Sundance expect that to change quickly.Harley Quinn Smith and Lily-Rose Depp ""Yoga Hosers"" - The Colleens from Kevin Smiths ""Tusk"" are back in the directors follow-up which finds the two teenage yoga enthusiasts teaming up with a legendary man-hunter to battle an ancient evil presence that threatens their party plans. The daughters of Smith and co-star Johnny Depp stole a couple scenes in ""Tusk"" but this is their first real opportunity to prove they can hold the screen like their fathers. Depp is already on Hollywoods radar co-starring opposite Natalie Portman in ""Planetarium"" and testing for the lead in Paramounts ""Looking for Alaska.""Michael Barbieri and Theo Taplitz ""Little Men"" - Director Ira Sachs returns to Sundance with this film that rests on the slender shoulders of its teenage stars. The duo play best friends whose bond is tested by their parents battle over a dress shop lease. Taplitz has done plenty of theater and creates short films in his spare time while Barbieri is a student at the Lee Strasberg Theater and Film Institute in New York. While ""Little Men"" is his feature film debut he also appears in Matt Kazmans short film ""Killer"" which premieres at Sundance.Lucas Hedges ""Manchester By the Sea"" - You probably remember Lucas Hedges as the lead bully in Wes Andersons ""Moonrise Kingdom."" The son of director Peter Hedges has since appeared in Jason Reitmans ""Labor Day"" Terry Gilliams ""The Zero Theorem"" and ""Kill the Messenger"" in which he played Jeremy Renners son. Here he plays a teen who falls into the care of his uncle (Casey Affleck) when his father dies. Director Kenneth Lonergan has gotten strong performances out of his young leads in ""You Can Count on Me"" and ""Margaret"" and Hedges could be his secret weapon in this film.Morgan Saylor ""White Girl"" - Best known as Dana Brody on ""Homeland"" Saylor takes center stage in ""White Girl"" as a college student who goes to extremes to get her drug dealer boyfriend out of jail. Its a potentially explosive role for Saylor so keep an eye on the rising young actress.Jacob Latimore ""Sleight"" - After holding his own opposite veteran co-stars like Forest Whitaker and Angela Bassett in ""Black Nativity"" Latimore graduated to supporting roles in box office hits such as ""Ride Along"" and ""The Maze Runner."" Now hes in the Sundance spotlight with ""Sleight"" playing a young street magician who turns to dealing drugs when hes left to care for his little sister following their mothers death. When his sister gets kidnapped he must rely on his smarts and sleight of hand to save her. If that doesnt sound like a star-making opportunity what does?Emma Greenwell ""Love and Friendship"" - The ""Shameless"" star is about to break out in a big way between her supporting role in this Whit Stillman movie and her upcoming turn in ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies."" She plays Lady Catherine opposite Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny in this comic riff on an incomplete Jane Austen novella. Greenwell also co-stars in the upcoming Hulu series ""The Path"" with Aaron Paul and Michelle Monaghan.Shashank Arora and the cast of ""Brahman Naman"" - Controversial Indian filmmaker Q has assembled an intriguing cast for his raunchy sex comedy which showcases Aroras knack for comedic timing. Arora (in yellow shirt) plays a nerdy hormone-fueled teen who competes for the National Quiz Championships in 1980s India while trying to lose his virginity along the way.Lily Gladstone ""Certain Women"" - This Native American newcomer is said to hold her own opposite her veteran co-star Kristen Stewart as a reclusive young ranch hand in the throes of her first existential crisis who meets Beth (Stewart) a recent law school grad who teaches an adult education class. Gladstone caught the acting bug after watching a ""Star Wars"" spinoff and quickly became involved in local theater in Montana where she grew up on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation. She starred opposite Stewarts ""Twilight"" co-star Chaske Spencer in ""Winter in the Blood"" and had a small role in the Benicio del Toro movie ""Jimmy P.""Lilith Stangenberg ""Wild"" - This up-and-coming German actress plays an young anarchist who chooses a life without hypocrisy or an obligatory safety net.

Nick Robinson and Chloe Grace Moretz join the battle against invading aliens in ""The 5th Wave"" which turns out to be a teen romance set against the end of the world. Photo Chuck Zlotnick McClatchy-Tribune News Service The 5th Wave At least the apocalypse starts well 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""The 5th Wave"" is very much a January release -- in other words not very good -- but at least its unusual in its awfulness. For its first half hour the movie is interesting and alarming in the best way laying down a sci-fi premise and delivering on it with convincing detail. Rarely does a movie that fails so utterly start so well. The filmmakers understand something about the end of the world If it were to start happening people would resist admitting it until the last possible moment and probably even beyond that. The human capacity to adapt while denying the obvious isnt infinite but its close and so the movies early scenes in which aliens launch waves of attack while people strive to adjust and maintain their normal schedules have an unsettling whiff of truth. To watch it is to feel that yes if this ever happened it would probably go just like this. Anyway for three waves ""The 5th Wave"" is a terrific picture but those opening waves come fairly quickly. The first one is the jaw dropper After parking in the sky for just long enough for people to think ""Maybe these visitors just want a parking space"" the aliens set off an electromagnetic wave that cuts off every engine every machine and every device so that cell phones go dark and planes fall out of the sky. All this is seen through the eyes of a high school girl Cassie (Chloe Grace Moretz) who watches with a mix of terror and stupefaction. To a lesser extent so does the audience. Wave two and three arent bad either. Wave four pretty much happens offscreen and then somewhere between waves four and five the movie slowly -- and thoroughly and irrevocably -- falls apart. The collapse comes as the result of an epic miscalculation With the human race facing annihilation how much should you care about a high school girls blossoming romantic interests? Not at all? Or slightly less than that? For an entire half hour ""The 5th Wave"" is able to disguise what its selling but once you catch on you catch on This is the teen apocalypse. This is Armageddon goes to the prom not literally but in spirit. If only it were literally about Armageddon and the prom -- if only it were crazily obvious -- ""The 5th Wave"" might have had the virtue of silliness. Instead it has the curse of earnestness. It is so sincere ... it is so sincere it could put you into a coma. Have you ever dreamed with your eyes open? Have you ever sat in a theater wondering who keeps snoring only to realize that it might be you? There are new experiences to be had here not experiences that youd want but experiences. Oh and by the way the movie doesnt end. It simply stops. You see ""The 5th Wave"" is the first book in a trilogy by Rick Yancey and if were not really vigilant and look to the skies and prepare theyre going to make at least two more of these things. Weve got to beat back the invasion now or the aliens are coming back. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Liev Schreiber follows up his exceptional Spotlight role with a fun turn as the stoically villainous Colonel Vosch and Maika Monroe a breakout star from last years It Follows is emo-cool as the sharpshooting spitfire Ringer. (It is a smidge unbelievable how quickly she and her fellow military teens get trained for war and the speed at which they figure out a pretty major twist regarding the Others.)Bens treacherous journey isnt as showy as Cassies but its nonetheless important in setting up the overarching plot of The 5th Wave a film that nicely stokes the imagination of a new generation of science-fiction movie nerds. 793 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1V9Y5DG",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/01/21/review-the-5th-wave-movie/79013726/,200,the5thwave27,the5thwave,usatoday

Taken on its own ""The 5th Wave"" is an effectively decent post-apocalyptic young-adult world-in-the-balance survival thriller. Yet the multitudinous devotees of Rick Yanceys wildly successful 2013 novel may have more issues with what has been edited or left out entirely than with whats survived the transition. Still the film will ride the inevitable wave of fandom and newcomers alike to moderate box office and a healthy afterlife allowing producers Tobey Maguire and Graham King to move forward with production of the other two books in the authors proposed trilogy ""The Infinite Sea"" (2014) and ""The Last Star"" to be published later this year. Enough of Yanceys ambitious narrative has made the final cut to reflect an arrestingly original spin on trendy genre tropes. In the present day Ohio teenager Cassie Sullivan (Chloe Grace Moretz) does what modern young people do drink beer at unsupervised house parties moon over boys -- in this case oblivious high-school football heartthrob Ben Parish (Nick Robinson) -- dote on her little brother Sam (Zackary Arthur) and banter with her laid-back father Oliver (Ron Livingston). But Cassies cozy suburban cocoon is soon shattered by the arrival of a massive alien ship coincidentally floating just above their street. Though its occupants dubbed ""the Others"" are silent and unseen they soon make their intentions clear by mounting a series of offensives. The first wave is an electromagnetic pulse that darkens the planet; the second wave consists of massive tsunamis and thunderous earthquakes; the third wave decimates most of the survivors via a deadly virus that claims Cassie mother Lisa (Maggie Siff) but to which some remain immune; the fourth wave reveals that selected humans dubbed Silencers are actually Others intent on hunting down the hardy few whove scattered to the wind; and the fifth wave is well the final two-thirds of the film. Showing up at a refugee camp in the woods Cassie Sam and Oliver are just in time for the arrival of Vosch (Liev Schreiber) a take-charge military colonel who orders the children bused to Wright Patterson Air Force Base and the adults to the camp meeting hall. What happens next is chaotic but necessarily inevitable leaving Cassie alone and on the run with a scavenged M-16 and a determination to rescue Sam from the base. Along the way shes shot by a mysterious sniper on a highway clogged with derelict vehicles (shades of ""The Walking Dead"" which shares with the film Georgia locations and more than a little visual iconography). She wakes up in the rustic cabin of Evan Walker (Alex Roe) a Chris Pine-ish hunk who insists on accompanying her but seems to be harboring a secret of his own. The final act takes place at the base itself and involves both the fate of the children and the improbable reunion of Cassie with Ben (by now nicknamed ""Zombie""). Key players in this sequence include the tough-as-nails Goth teen warrior Ringer (Maika Monroe) the composite character Sgt. Reznik (Maria Bello in a thankless role) and a clutch of frighteningly young soldiers whose mission is not what it seems. Yanceys influences are as obvious as they are legion yet the source novel managed to blend the bittersweet yearnings of an adolescent girl on the cusp of adulthood with the demands of a cinematic global catastrophe that forged her into a hardened ruthless survival machine. Nevertheless she understood intuitively that humanity was all she had left against an unseen yet brutal foe. This message gamely survives a screenplay by Susannah Grant Akiva Goldsman and Alex Pinkner that seems perversely determined to keep the best parts of the book out of the movie (in the same way the much-discussed Battle of Yonkers didnt make it into ""World War Z""). Gone is the explanatory prologue the siege at Cassies house during the third wave her odyssey in the woods most of the fallout from her gunshot wound and the bulk of the immensely appealing and very well-written common-sense internal monologues that make Cassie well Cassie. The gambit might have worked except for whats been substituted in their stead. Carrie and Ben are friendlier before the siege; the mostly off-screen second wave has been literalized with unnecessary (but not bad) CGI; the first four waves themselves are hurriedly compressed into the films initial half-hour; and the denouement plays as rushed and perfunctory. And Cassie doesnt drink beer either. Director J Blakeson whose only previous feature was the small but well-received British kidnap thriller ""The Disappearance of Alice Creed"" (2010) works well with his generally fine cast yet seems increasingly unsure of the films pace and flow. Moretz makes the most of a script that gives her a softer Cassie than on the page while Livingston whos looking more and more like George Clooney and Schreiber who can pivot plausibly from good to evil on a dime play it like the pros they are. As the before-and-after faces of Cassies budding sexuality Robinson and Roe make up in soulful looks what they lack in charisma.Craft contributions are above par led by Jon Billingtons evocative and detailed production design; the sound mix emphasizes gunshots and explosions to a distracting degree. Like the adaptations of Steven Kings ""Dreamcatcher"" and ""The Mist"" ""The 5th Wave"" suffers primarily from a few key decisions that undercut the good intentions. Yet with two films left in the trilogy the filmmakers still have the time and opportunity to get this quality material better than right.

Elizabeth says June 27 2016 at 400 pm While the movie was not horrific it was not even close to the book. Some of the main/major parts of the story were excluded from the movie. It was back to back non-suspensful ""action"" that was unrealistic and confusing. The idea and plot of the story is great but there was too much information that was excluded from the movie. On the other hand I absolutely loved the book I could have gone without ever seeing the movie in facet it annoyed me. This movie was bland and predictable... just another blah movie. I would reccomend adding a little more detail and get some better more realistic actors. Reply jonusb says June 6 2016 at 831 am Please let me start by saying I havent read the books. I didnt think the movie was all that bad; but it left at least one unanswered question to me. How come no one except Cassie finds the idea of the army having power (fully functional vehicles for example) after the electromagnetic pulse wiped out everything on Earth the least bit suspicious? Reply Salvadore says May 15 2016 at 601 pm Lets just say the book was amazing there was sole there was fear there was alien tech. Then there was this movie with the same title with bland to very little story two main characters that could easily have dropped in from the twilight series boasting their overplayed attributes and thats about it. No sole no alien tech lame acting. I would rather listen to Donald Trump then ever watch that bit of flotsam again. Reply liverpiggy says April 11 2016 at 521 pm Have just watched The Fifth Wave and found it to be an enjoyable experience. Moretz is an engaging lead and proved to be more than upto the task of portraying her role as Cassy. Those here in the comments seem to be such nitpickers its a wonder they enjoy any movie. This is a fun film no masterpiece but then not many films are. As a fan of apocalyptic drama and the science fiction genre this tale was right up my alley. I do hope that the albeit very modest financial returns this film has generated will still be enough to accommodate the concluding parts of this interesting story being given the green light. This is the only ""YA"" movie Ive warmed to. Couldnt hack Twilight. Gave up on the Hunger Games after the first film and could not raise any enthusiasm to see The Maze Runner and Divergent was a slog to get through. I guess with my critism of those movies Im somewhat hypocritical but this is all subjective and if people enjoy something I would have no desire to prevent there doing so by wanting the film not be made as some here have done. Really is it so hard to just NOT WATCH WHAT YOU DONT ENJOY AND LET THOSE THAT DO ENJOY IT ENJOY IT IN PEACE Reply Ginger says March 21 2016 at 838 am Yet another whitewashed film. Reply Sam Hankins (redjellydonut) says February 14 2016 at 222 pm ""Yet with two films left in the trilogy the filmmakers still have the time and opportunity to get this quality material better than right."" Thats one of the most wildly optimistic predictions youre likely to read on these pages. The movie was a catastrophic train wreck. We wont be seeing any more of Cassie and thank the maker for it. Reply James says January 30 2016 at 854 pm I was less than impressed with the movie -- among the worst Ive seen. Issues 1) No explanation of how the ""Others"" take over the U.S. Military -- and presumably that of every other country on the planet as well. Also no backstory on the rest of government law enforcement etc. 2) The ""Army"" personnel from the Colonel to all others are all wearing Marpat -- yet they advertise themselves as Army. There are some other service uniforms represented; and somehow they are all collected at Maxwell AFB. 3) The appearance of military vehicles and aircraft after everything has stopped working should have generated more than passing suspicion; but also an EMP event would not fry everything indefinitely. Once the EMP was passed anything not damaged would work again. Even Science fiction should be plausible/believable. Reply Sonya says May 17 2016 at 1033 pm Much of these points are finalised in the second book ) Reply Disappointed says January 25 2016 at 1231 am How come there is not even an alien when there is a UFO floating around...if the alien are capable of making so many wave just to kill off all humans..why bother using human or should I say children to kill human? Cassie are able to survive so long in the a forest without any survival skill or at least show what she have to hunt in order to survive. the best part is Cassie peek at Evan when he takes a swim/bath in the river.. which usually the other way round...thanks the director for this daring decision and I personally feel this is a turn off...thumb up for all the actor and actress for trying their best to make this movie as interesting as possible. overall..this movie is a huge disappointment... Reply Biancaxo says January 24 2016 at 743 am Just watch this movie. The first 30minutes or so looks really promising everything ruined when Cassie met Evan. Their scene is too much and overshadowed the main issue. The bootcamp scene seems more interesting than two lover Cassie and Evan the human-alien. The last part is even worst Cassies reunion with Ben lack of feelings it could be dramatized like maybe she hugs him or so and yes they should had extend the movie just a little more because the ending is so dissapointing. Reply Danique says April 12 2016 at 811 am This is just What i thought i mean casy en ben Realy need to have a relationship in THE end right i mean in de beginning it was about those two en then she met evan its so dissapointing i think Reply nuri says January 22 2016 at 1001 am Watch The 5th Wave Full Movie http//imgur.com/YlvzbIW Reply John Hall says January 20 2016 at 836 pm its a trash Creepiest movie ever..waste of time i left the movie house full of frustration and anger..totally a garbage one Reply JC says January 19 2016 at 554 am Total utter garbage. Pretty obvious if you can sit through this - that all involved are finished in the industry. I guess the producers are just trying to get some money back on it now. Reply Gage says January 14 2016 at 641 pm I hope Nick Robinsons career dies after this. He was also terrible in Jurassic World. He cant act. Reply DougW says January 14 2016 at 1227 pm My guess is we wont be seeing sequels to this. For an alien invasion story we spend too much time in the woods and on a military base. Unlike the earlier waves in the story the fifth wave is very small scale. Reply Liz says January 14 2016 at 1115 am Its The Infinite Sea not The Invisibly Sea. That one doesnt even make grammatical sense.

TWITTER 1/22/2016 Chloe Grace Moretz fights an alien invasion in this adaptation of Rick Yanceys sci-fi best-seller. Another week another plucky teenage girl with the fate of the world on her shoulders buffeted by smoldering glances from two strong yet sensitive young men. Adapted from Rick Yanceys 2013 novel The 5th Wave stars Chloe Grace Moretz as Cassie Sullivan a high school student whose world is upended when aliens invade. If that sounds tantalizingly like a retread of the sci-fi blockbuster that Moretzs character headlined in Clouds of Sils Maria the new film is both more engaging and just as generic as that movie-within-a-movie. Director J Blakeson (behind the camera for the first time since 2009s drum-tight The Disappearance of Alice Creed) might be making franchise bait but he exhibits a relatively restrained reliance on spectacle and the screenplay by Jeff Pinkner Susannah Grant and Akiva Goldsman is light on the aphoristic earnestness that bogged down the most recent Hunger Games or last years Goldsman-penned Insurgent. Cassie is the kind of girl who gets home from a party and ducks her head around her parents door so they know shes made curfew. Her Dad (Ron Livingston) gives her an appreciative thumbs-up and she goes to say goodnight to her little brother (Transparents Zackary Arthur) by serenading him to sleep. The idyll is short-lived. Everything changed Cassie tells us in a voiceover when an alien craft appeared in the sky. Soon after an electromagnetic pulse takes out the worlds power -- the first phase. Next come floods then avian flu then a ground invasion. All this is condensed by the film into a short flashback as prelude. Cassie and her brother narrowly escape the rushing waters of a burst dam at home in Ohio while coastal cities suffer the worst of it. A montage of computer-generated tidal waves smashing into Miami and the London Bridge and up office stairwells is terrifying and tossed off as though Blakeson is in a hurry to get the apocalypse out of the way and on with the story. When the bird flu hits Cassies best friend is quarantined at the local football field never to be heard from again. Soon the family is strapping packs to their back and abandoning their house which seems to be by-the-course in movies like this though surely it would be most peoples last move. They lob in to a nearby campsite turned tent-city where Cassies father gives her a gun. ""Nowhere is safe anymore"" he tells her. Before long a reliably inscrutable Liev Schreiber rolls in at the head of a phalanx of tanks. He entreats parents to put their children on buses so they can be taken away to a secure location. In the most contrived narrative transition in the film Cassie gets off the bus when her little brother insists she find his teddy bear. Shes promptly left in the dust as the tyke wails on the back seat. Taken to an army base and given the nickname Nugget the boy is enlisted to fight the invaders in a squad led by his sisters old crush Ben Parish (Jurassic Worlds Nick Robinson). Theyre joined by Ringer a tough cookie who was kicked out of her last unit for disciplinary issues played with scene-stealing relish by Maika Monroe (It Follows). Shes particularly memorable next to Moretz who has always made for a convincingly scrappy teenager but is something of a blank slate as the films heroine with line readings pitched at a level of panicked desperation that never really varies. Their task of defending the planet against the imminent fifth wave is complicated by the discovery that ""the others"" as the aliens are called throughout can assume human form. This wrinkle is the pics savviest allowing Blakeson to emphasize the personal and earthbound. There are plenty of shoot-outs in The 5th Wave but no interminable aerial combat. Meanwhile Cassie is tramping through the woods en route to the military base to reclaim her brother. Shes saved from enemy snipers by Evan Walker a mysterious farm boy played by Alex Roe a pretty very earnest English actor in the Robert Pattinson-Theo James tradition. Its rare for almost all of a movies clangers to be given to one character but Roe gets thrown the lot. Cassie wakes up in Evans farmhouse after having been shot and is naturally suspicious of her benefactor. He calms her nerves by telling her ""I couldnt save my parents but I could save you."" This middle section of the film is the saggiest weighed down by a leaden romance that seems all too familiar but it picks up again when Cassie and Ben team up to rescue Nugget from under the nose of Schreibers conniving Colonel Vosch. In a sequence sustained seamlessly by editor Paul Rubell the kids stick it to the adults and strike out on their own. If part of YAs appeal is that it provides a fantasy of independence from parents at a time when young people find it deferred longer than ever Enrique Chediaks glossless digital photography locates The 5th Wave very much in the here and now investing it with the same earthiness he gave 2014s The Maze Runner.
