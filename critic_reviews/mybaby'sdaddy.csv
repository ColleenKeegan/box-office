Comments My Babys Daddy Eddie Griffin Anthony Anderson and Michael Imperioli star in this tepid comedy about three confirmed bachelors who all become fathers at the same time. Director Cheryl Dunye (The Watermelon Woman Stranger Inside) has been fighting the good fight for years as an independent filmmaker so I guess shes entitled to take the money and run. If I were her Id run like hell. PG-13 99 min. By J.R. Jones Now Playing Sorry there are no upcoming showtimes for My Babys Daddy Reviews/comments Subscribe to this thread By Email Subscribing...

Three roommates (Anthony Anderson Michael Imperioli and cowriter Eddie Griffin) live together in endless adolescence only to see their tree-house idyll shaken by the simultaneous pregnancies of their girlfriends. There follows much poorly paced ""growing up"" - sad really for guys who look like theyve seen the backside of 35. As a bonus ""titty milk"" and its magical properties are fetishized to an alarming degree.

Its an acceptably executed time-killer that should do OK short-term biz. Not calling itself ""Three Men and Three Babies"" is as much of an imaginative leap as the new comedy ""My Babys Daddy"" affords. Though suspiciously yanked from critics pre-opening perusal at the 11th hour pic produced co-written and starring Eddie Griffin isnt an embarrassment. Rather its an acceptably executed thoroughly routine time-killer that should do OK short-term biz amidst January new-release doldrums then prove a popular rental item. That it took Griffin and three (credited) collaborators to come up with a script this by-numbers only proves once again that too many cooks homogenize the soup. After cartoon credits depicting protags close friendship from the cradle live action commences as theyre pushing 30 -- but still living like footloose teenagers in grumbling Uncle Virgils (John Amos) South Philly house. Four-eyed dweeby sanitation worker Lonnie (Eddie Griffin) remains cluelessly in love with lifelong crush object Rolonda (Paula Jai Parker) whos so trashy and undeserving she might as well have ""H"" and ""O"" tattooed on her forehead. Tubby G. (Anthony Anderson) has a better thing going with Xi Xi (Bai Ling) the daughter of the owner of the corner market where he day-jobs. But he has fantasies of becoming a professional boxer. White ""bro"" Dominic (Michael Imperioli) works at a recording studio alongside gorgeous Nia (Joanna Bacalso) with whom hes having a fling. His focus however is on making it as a rap act manager with current hopes pegged on Caucasian-goofball duo Tha Brothaz Stylz (comedians Randy amp; Jason Sklar). Bachelor days however are thrown for a loop when all three of the mens current squeezes simultaneously announce theyre pregnant. Marriage -- even cohabitation -- is not yet discussed. But the guys show up alongside expectant moms at a birthing class (taught by Amy Sedaris who like everyone here has had better material to work with). The births are simultaneous too natch opening the gate wide to barf pee and poo jokes. While Lonnie instantly warms to ""Mr. Mom"" duties G. and Dom dont. All three get a sobering wakeup call when the tiny tots briefly crawl out of sight while left alone during a house party. Just when dads vow to take fatherhood more seriously however trouble looms on the mommy front. Xi Xi and her uptight Chinese father (Denis Akiyama) suffer major doubts about G. when he takes in a cousin (Method Man) newly sprung -- yet again -- from the slammer. Dom discovers that Nia has acquired a live-in lesbian lover (Naomi Gaskin). Lonnie works up the nerve to seize full-time responsibility for his child but fears hes blown any chance of romance with young single mother Brandy (Marsha Thomason). These complications work out smoothly of course with helmer Cheryl Dunye using expert montage to fast-forward through some of the more predictable narrative developments. Decently paced ""My Babys Daddy"" is no longer than need be at just over an hour and a quarter (plus 8 1/2 minute closing credit crawl). In typical current comedy mode supporting characters tend to milk laughs from cheap racial stereotyping (e.g. Xi Xis family members are named Cha-Ching Bling Bling Sing Sing and Fung You) which then gets patly upended in equally cartooned warm-and-fuzzy fashion later on. Pic improves once early crude jokes are abandoned for a more seriocomic air. Good baby-wrangling during seg in which tots scamper loose reps closest thing to a memorable set piece. For Dunye of enterprising lesbian indie pic ""Watermelon Woman"" and outstanding HBO womens prison tale ""The Stranger Inside"" feature reps a lateral move -- a good one commercially less so artistically though latter owes more to script than to her competent handling. Likewise entire cast is good enough without scoring any memorable moments that better material mightve prompted. In particular Amos Method Man Sedaris and Scott Thompson (in one scene as a store cashier) just get to glimmer when theyre obviously ready to shine. Tech and design package is polished if undistinguished. Soundtrack is no surprise wallpapered with hip hop tracks -- the most obvious tip to fact that ""Baby"" involves myriad rap identified talents both on and offscreen.

Starring Eddie Griffin Anthony Anderson Michael Imperioli. Directed by Cheryl Dunye. (PG-13. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""My Babys Daddy"" is probably less painful than actual childbirth but its still a very long 86 minutes. It starts with implausible characters and descends into potty jokes (not just involving babies) racial stereotypes and a criminal lack of originality. Sample gag Anthony Anderson playing the pudgiest boxer since the pre- grilling machine George Foreman is in the ring when his girlfriend tells him shes pregnant. You guessed it Caught off guard the fighter takes a surprise punch. Anderson later competes with that first stroke of comic genius by taking a stream of baby urine to the face. The second moment -- no kidding - - brings the films biggest laugh. Andersons character is bunking with two pals ""Old School"" style when all three find out theyre about to be fathers. Theyre supposed to be lifelong buddies but none looks as if hed have much to do with the other. ""The Sopranos "" Michael Imperioli who never seems young or lighthearted enough for a frat-boy existence plays a slick record producer. Eddie Griffin is the third housemate a nerdy earnest basketball referee. Griffin has elevated many a bad comedy but not this one. He co-wrote the script but gave himself the most boring character. He does look rather sweet next to a baby though; hes the only adult to come off well during patented ""Three Men and a Baby""-style mishaps with formula and diapers. The movie focuses less on babies than on the women in the mens lives. Griffins character has been swindled by a gold-digging hoochie (how convenient to make the woman bad and the man a saint thereby avoiding that whole messy issue of absent fathers). Imperiolis character is supposed to be a player yet his babys mother rejects him in one of several plotlines that dont make sense. The boxer is dating the daughter of his boss at a minimarket. Shes played by Bai Ling an actress far too sleek and sophisticated for these highjinks. She might have clicked opposite the equally worldly Imperioli but Anderson looks like a baby himself next to her. The depiction of the Asian American family is beyond insulting with an extended riff on characters names. That the movie casts a wide net in its racial humor doesnt make it excusable and never ever makes it funnier. Having poseur white rappers use Snoop Doggs ""izzle"" language is a gag so tired and so often repeated in the film that it inspires something close to anger. The most disheartening aspect of the movie however is that it was directed by Cheryl Dunye a talented filmmaker who made the low-budget wonder ""The Watermelon Woman"" and ""The Stranger Inside"" a fine HBO movie about female prisoners. Which brings me to the films saddest moment in which an ex- con (played with spirit by rapper Method Man) decorates his room to resemble a prison cell. Dunye having rendered the struggles of prisoners so poignantly in ""Stranger Inside"" is now making fun of the phenomenon of internalized incarceration. Is this what talented young women are reduced to in Hollywood or is the sellout all her own? Either way its depressing. -- Advisory This film contains raw language ethnic and gross-out humor.
