By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor March 28 2008 Save for later Saved Gaming the System MIT students (from l. Liza Lapira Aaron Yoo Kate Bosworth Jim Sturgess) take on Vegas in 21. courtesy of peter iovino/columbia pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Good movies about card sharks should be far more plentiful than they are. Is it because card playing is not as inherently visual as say pool hustling? Still youd think that with all the TV hours devoted to poker some enterprising filmmaker would figure out a way to make it all work for the movies.Last week we had ""The Grand"" an improvisational mess starring Woody Harrelson about a high-stakes poker tournament. This week theres ""21"" based on Ben Mezrichs nonfiction bestseller ""Bringing Down the House"" about Massachusetts Institute of Technology students who used their card-counting skills to score millions in Las Vegas.The film is ""inspired by"" the book - i.e. great liberties were taken. But the essential premise is true and its a doozy. If only director Robert Luketic and screenwriters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb had not opted for glitz. As filmmakers theyre playing for very low stakes. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is an math genius who wants to attend Harvard Medical School but cant afford the tuition. As a possible candidate for a scholarship he is told that he lacks life experience - the kind at least that looks good on a resume. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? 21 doesnt play its cards right When he is approached by his math professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey) to head up a clandestine coven of MIT student card counters Ben reluctantly agrees. Before long he is piling up the chips in Vegas.In the films early scenes Ben is portrayed as such a straight-arrow good guy that his rather sudden transformation into blackjack rock star seems phony. Mickey chose Ben because the kid had grace under pressure; when Ben comes down with an attack of grandiosity and loses big we can see it coming a mile away. The filmmakers want the audience to get juiced by the high-stakes gambling but they also want to position the movie as a cautionary tale Lose your cool lose your money.The more moralistic ""21"" gets the less enjoyable it is. And the moralism is selective. On the one hand we are subjected to scenes in which captured card counters are beaten by the casinos enforcer (Laurence Fishburne). Crime I guess doesnt pay (even though technically card counting is not illegal).On the other hand there are puzzling sequences like the one in which Ben lies to his overjoyed widowed mother (Helen Carey) about winning the med-school scholarship. Luketic places so little emphasis on the ignominiousness of this moment that Ben inadvertently no doubt comes across as a crass jerk.But at least he comes across as something in this scene. Most of the time hes just bland. And since Luketic doesnt do much to fill in the personalities of the other players (played by among others Aaron Yoo and Kate Bosworth) the vacuum ends up being filled by Spacey. Once a great movie actor he has been coasting for years on smarm shtick. Hes tolerably entertaining in ""21"" but he occupies center stage by default.What must it be like for a geek genius to saunter into a casino and know hes going to bring down the house? ""21"" never really answers this question because the people in it are all prefabricated stereotypes.The movie also misrepresents genius. Card counting after all is not the same thing as mastering superstring theory - an autistic savant with a low IQ like Dustin Hoffman in ""Rain Man"" could be a whiz at it. The film doesnt even do a good job of explaining how card counting works which is probably just as well. Even the best counters have their debacles. If youve spent money to see this film you dont need to lose your shirt too. Grade C Rated PG-13 for some violence and sexual content including partial nudity.

Peter Iovino/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Peter Iovino/Columbia Pictures Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgress) is an MIT student counting cards in Las Vegas to pay for his education in 21. Peter Iovino/Columbia Pictures Director Robert LuketicGenre DramaRunning Time 123 minutes Watch a Clip Based loosely on a scheme concocted by MIT students to beat the blackjack odds in Vegas this slick caper -- a sort of collegiate Oceans 16 with significantly less star power but only a touch less oomph -- mostly comes up aces. Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe) plays a boyishly brilliant math student whos importuned by fetching Kate Bosworth to join a clutch of card-counting brainiacs in a profitable little extracurricular sideline Under the supervision of scenery-chewing Prof. Kevin Spacey they fly to Vegas on weekends identify hot tables and rake in the chips for a few days before heading back to classes on Monday. Card-counting being frowned upon by the casinos there are disguises and fake names involved and casino enforcer Laurence Fishburn is on hand to lend a modicum of suspense. Presumably because director Robert Luketic knows that theres a limit to how exciting hell be able to make the sight of cards being turned and chips being shoveled much of 21 is taken up with the laying-out and explaining of a counting scheme thats going to go right over most moviegoers heads. Still despite some credibility-stretching plot twists -- and a romance with next to no chemistry -- the film is probably sharp enough to keep its youngish target audience from wishing there were slot machines in the lobby to offer an escape.

In essence it adheres to the evergreen guys-on-a-mission template with hard-up undergrad Ben (Jim Sturgess lightweight but passable) fearing hell be priced out of Harvard Medical School. He is lured by maths professor Rosa (Kevin Spacey urbane but hokey) into a guerrilla unit of his best students ready to take on the baize tables his argument is that twenty-one is a simple game and by remembering which cards have been dealt you give yourself a better chance of knowing when to fold or take a chance. Prospects look good for the rest of the picture at this stage but disappointment takes over with the realisation its all being pitched to a pre-teen audience smoothing out potentially juicy moral dilemmas and sanitising the grown-up throb of the Vegas experience into anodyne glitz.Actually theres something rather pernicious in the way the film drools over the towering chips palatial suites and incipient gambling fever as if to tantalise viewers way too young to be admitted to these very establishments; all of which hardly keeps us on-message that friendships a greater prize than cash alone. The whizzo-conceit and slick visual bling do give it an undeniably diverting buzz yet the movies cautionary formula shows its hand way before the clunky final reel.

Absolutely nothing redeeming about it at all. If I had not paid APS8.50 to see it I would have left after the first 10 minutes - infact no after the first 2 minutes - the intro (which was basically just a poor trailer for the whole film with a dodgy cringy voice over and slow motion montage) being one of the worst things about it.

By using ""Basic Strategy"" (a system of play that reduces a dealers advantage to 1%) and a ""simple"" method of card counting (as explained in a featurette on the DVD release) you too can legally beat the odds at the casinos. Then you remember that Vegas agreed to let this little production film right in its very own casinos which seems to be a tip-off that it cant as easy as it looks. Still as a movie 21 is a fun watch. Solidly constructed with a batch of decent actors (including Kevin Spacey and Jim Sturgess who made his mark in Across the Universe) it spins out its tale of a real-life MIT card counting team with a near perfect balance of glitz suspense and moral questioning. Near perfect. One might have asked for an actress with a more credible balance of brains and beauty than Kate Bosworth--who shades a little too far to the runway to fit in. And it might have been nice had the film addressed some of the subtler issues of the morality (not legality) of cheating--and not just at cards. But overall if you dont look too closely 21 is an honest-to-God winner.   (Red Vaughn) Legal doesnt mean the pitbosses wont have you deleted from existence apparently.

Comments 21 No movie with Kevin Spacey as a heartless prick can be all bad but this gambling thriller based on Ben Mezrichs nonfiction book Bringing Down the House hasnt got much else going for it. An MIT math professor Spacey recruits five undergraduate whizzes to accompany him to Las Vegas where they run a card-counting scam at the blackjack tables and live like pharaohs on their winnings. The students are so blandly written you might want to count them too. Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde) directed; with Jim Sturges Kate Bosworth and Laurence Fishburne. PG-13 123 min. By J.R.

Directed by Robert Luketic. (PG-13. 123 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Motivation. In telling stories and creating characters its an interesting thing One strong motivation is better than two weak ones - or even two strong ones. In real life a man might marry a woman say because he loves her and she has lots of money but in fiction it has to be either love or money. Making it both is just too fuzzy. It doesnt work. Why doesnt it work? Thats a whole other story. In fact thats practically a philosophical question Maybe it doesnt work because art needs to be simpler than real life. Conversely maybe it doesnt work because art needs to be more honest than the fake stories we tell ourselves. In the above example for instance hes marrying her for the money. You know it. I know it. Hes just not admitting it. Which brings us to ""21"" a movie with an irresistible premise that ultimately collapses around the whole issue of motivation. Until it does this is a thoroughly entertaining picture about a young man who gets involved with an unusual gang of con artists. Hes an MIT student who falls in with other MIT students in a card-counting scam to take the Las Vegas casinos for all theyre worth. Based on real-life events ""21"" lavishes time in establishing our hero Ben (Jim Sturgess) and his world. This grounding of the action in Bens quotidian existence is one of the films most appealing features. We see a young man with big longings and a circumscribed existence. He wants to get into Harvard Medical School and has been working at it for years participating in extracurricular activities and building elaborate science projects with his nerdy friends. He is a working-class kid who depends on scholarships and who works in a clothing store making eight bucks an hour. He likes a girl (Kate Bosworth) but hes too scared to talk to her. For anyone who nostalgically remembers being young and powerless the first half hour of ""21"" is a good corrective. Then in an ironic turn he finds out from Harvard that in order to get a scholarship he needs to demonstrate in an essay that hes ""dazzling."" Heres a kid who had made his life as boring as possible in order to get into Harvard and now hes supposed to be exciting somehow. By the time he meets up with a smirky Mephistopheles-like professor (Kevin Spacey) who promises him the world the movie has us rooting for this young man completely. We want him to have money sex and a Harvard education. He deserves it all. ""21"" provides an ideal role for Spacey who brings to the professor all his shrewd seductive and untrustworthy charm. The professor heads up the card-counting team which happens to include Jill (Bosworth) the girl of Bens dreams the all-American blonde at the end of every rags-to-riches story. In a striking change of location that says it all the story moves from the drab eternal winter of Boston to the lit-up desert paradise of Vegas and Ben soon gets to experience what its like to be a big shot - the best kind of big shot of all a young big shot. Everything about the first hour of ""21"" is enjoyable. The Boston scenes have a lived-in veracity and the Vegas scenes have the allure of tawdry fantasy. Its fun to be in on how card-counters work their magic at the blackjack tables even if its not easy to understand exactly what theyre doing or how theyre doing it. The only problem is this Sooner or later the movie has to kick in with a story. And when it does its not one that makes sense in terms of Ben or his motives. Without going into detail the movie complicates Bens motivation in ways that are hard to believe. After establishing him as one kind of guy the movie asks us to buy him as another kind of guy and with that the seams come out of the story. ""21"" turns sour and convoluted - still watchable but no longer personal just mechanical. Or to put it another way by the middle of the night ""21"" is way ahead but by the end it just breaks even. -- Advisory Adult conversation violence and a scene of sexual intimacy.

"21 Count on Spacey | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies21 Count on Spacey ""Dont give in to your emotions"" Kevin Spaceys shady prof character admonishes young card sharps in the casino caper 21.Kevin Spacey above as a card-counting prof and Laurence Fishburne as a casino security chief help save 21 from being a losing proposition.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 28 2008Starring Jim Sturgess Kevin Spacey Kate Bosworth and Laurence Fishburne. Directed by Robert Luketic. 122 minutes. At major theatres. 14A ""Dont give in to your emotions"" Kevin Spaceys shady prof character admonishes young card sharps in the casino caper 21.Viewers are forced to heed the same advice over the films long two hours. There arent many emotions to be gambled in following Massachusetts Institute of Technology math whizzes who conspire to beat the Las Vegas blackjack tables. The robots of Transformers have more blood to them.This includes the tepid romance between lead brainiacs Ben (Jim Sturgess of Across the Universe) and Jill (Kate Bosworth). They cant muster the sexy asides or smart-alec banter typical of movies of this genre the Oceans Eleven franchise being the prime example. And this is very much not an Oceans romp - at least until it reaches the third act when the high-stakes antics get sillier and also more entertaining partly redeeming the picture.Article Continued Below21 is based on a true story chronicled in Bringing Down the House Ben Mezrichs best-seller about six MIT students who shook down Vegas for millions in the 1990s. The movie is also the inferior also-ran to Canadian-made The Last Casino a well-played 2004 TV film based on the same book that screens regularly on The Movie Network. You almost wish that 21 were more of a rip at least when it comes to explaining the central scam. The Canadian movie did it much better and without resorting to the card-levitating CGI stunts employed by 21 director Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde). Those not fully versed in blackjack lore present company included may find the early going in 21 to be just a little baffling.The scam is card counting a practice that is totally legal (as were repeatedly told) but that is highly frowned upon by casinos which hate to lose even more than players do. By counting the cards and tag-teaming one another with furtive signals a team of determined Poindexters can break the house - unless the house fights back through intimidation or even worse banishment from the casino.This is the down-side risk counselled by MIT prof Mickey Rosa whom Spacey invests with the psycho smarm he brings to his most vivid characters. Once a champion card counter until he was finally booted by determined casino security chief Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) Rosa now seeks to pass the greasy baton to a fresh young team of blackjack hustlers his reward being 50 per cent of the take.Then theres the upside which is the chance to win enough money at the tables to finance the most lavish of dreams. In young Bens case its the 300000 he needs to pay for his tuition and boarding at Harvard medical school. Shy Ben has the brains but not the bucks. He also has a photographic memory and a facility for numbers as do his preppy blackjack team mates Jill Choi (Aaron Yoo) Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts).Card counting is a task of strict logic which explains Rosas Yoda-like insistence that emotions be kept in check. Otherwise you could get carried away and actually begin - gasp - gamblingThis is easy enough for Ben to do (easier than Sturgess a Brit mastering a Boston accent) since he has about as much personality as a Ken doll. Hes not modest though telling us through narrative voiceover (the tale is told in flashback) that ""I have a great mind.""If 21 had to rely solely on the school-funding exertions of Ben the drama would be considerably short of a full deck. Fortunately the older and hammier rogues carry the picture leaving the junior robots behind to count their chips. Spaceys turn as the wacky professor is like something out of an Ed Wood movie as he morphs from a smooth-talking academic into a vein-popping thug. Hes well matched with Fishburnes knuckle-cracking security boss Williams. When Spacey and Fishburne really go at each other 21 finally starts to add up to something.

Movie review ""21"" with Jim Sturgess Kate Bosworth Kevin Spacey Laurence Fishburne Aaron Yoo. Directed by Robert Luketic from a screenplay by Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb based on the book ""Bringing Down the House"" by Ben Mezrich. 119 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some violence and sexual content including partial nudity. Several theaters. Robert Luketics card-counting Vegas caper ""21"" is filled with wicked grins; in fact entire scenes seem to take place with little happening but people smiling at each other in that naughty were-all-in-this-together way conspirators do when theyre up to something not entirely nice. The movie is based rather loosely on Ben Mezrichs nonfiction book ""Bringing Down the House"" about a team of MIT students who turned blackjack into a science finding a way to beat casinos at their own game. And its enjoyable enough though some of those wicked grins grow hollow after a while. Kevin Spacey in particular cruises through the movie as if hes already given his real performance somewhere else and is reprising it under mild duress. Theres a fine line between a character whos bored with what hes doing and an actor who isnt challenged by his role and its hard to tell here exactly which side of the line Spaceys performance falls on. As Mickey Rosa the MIT teacher whos the ringleader of the student team (they meet in secret like a geeky Fight Club) Spacey rattles off his lines in a theatrical yet vaguely disinterested way exuding oily deadpan confidence. Hes playing the kind of teacher whos always performing and Spaceys take on the role fits -- except that weve seen him give this exact performance a few too many times before. Meanwhile Laurence Fishburne doesnt have enough to do as a casino enforcer. He gives his all to lines like ""I will break your cheek with a small hammer and then I will kill you"" (an impressive threat; this is a guy who really thinks about how to scare people) and then vanishes for lengthy periods. The MIT team is lively though a few of the characters are underwritten (particularly the kid played by Aaron Woo of ""Disturbia"" a young actor with enough charisma and comic timing to easily carry his own movie). Jim Sturgess (""Across the Universe"") is boyishly charming like the young John Cusack as the main character a smart student trying to make enough money to pay for Harvard Medical School. Reluctantly drawn into the card-counting circle he gets seduced by the lifestyle leaving behind his old friends and lying to his old-school Boston mom who still believes that ""hahd work pays off."" But if hes so smart why does he stash all his winnings behind a ceiling tile in his dorm room? Hasnt he ever seen any movies? Luketic best known for ""Legally Blonde"" gives it all an agreeable bounce even as we see all too clearly exactly where its going. (I dont mean that literally; this film often seems to be taking place during an MIT light-bulb shortage with numerous absurdly dark scenes.) ""21"" doesnt quite hit the jackpot but with popcorn it should satisfy.

Haunted by the firefight one that left several members of his unit dead and several critically injured now wracked with guilt about the men he couldnt save staff sergeant Brandon King (a diligent Ryan Phillippe) focuses on one thing getting back to his familys Texas ranch and getting back to life as a civilian with his childhood best friend and comrade-in-arms Steve (Channing Tatum). But after the welcome-home parade and the awarding of medals the much-decorated Brandon learns hes isnt being discharged after all. Rather hes being sent back to Iraq thanks to a policy -- Stop-Loss -- that lets the military redeploy soldiers even after theyve completed their service. ENLARGE Brandons troubles and the movies troubles begin more or less simultaneously -- when the sergeant decides that hell no he wont go. Instead hell go AWOL -- a tough plot turn to swallow considering his stalwart sense of duty and almost saintly nature -- and request intervention from his senator in D.C. Lots of luck. Steves pretty fiancee Michele (Abbie Cornish) comes along on the quixotic contrived road trip which has more detours than a Michelin guide. There are visits to the parents of a fallen soldier from Brandons unit; to a burned blinded amputee buddy at a military hospital; and a lawyer in New York to learn about assuming a new identity and moving to Canada -- all punctuated by flashbacks to the carnage that is daily life in Iraq. Its an awful lot of stops for a fellow whos got the police on his tail. In fact the journey makes about as much sense as the rest of ""Stop-Loss"" which is swamped by cliches continuity problems stock characters and very good intentions. Hors de Prix (Priceless) Certain Americans in Paris getting their first bite of a baguette vow to replicate the signature French bread in their kitchens back home. Flour? Check. Yeast? Check. Pinch of salt? Yup. But the loaf never matches up to the one at the boulangerie. Must be something with the water. Hollywood filmmakers watch a particular sort of French romp -- ""Cousin Cousine"" and ""Trois Hommes et un Couffin"" spring immediately to mind -- and plan a remake in English. (Watch this space for the Americanization of ""Priceless."" ) But the U.S.-made product never quite matches the flavor of the original. Must be something with the water. ENLARGE Audrey Tautou in Hors de Prix (Priceless) In this case its the water of the Cote dAzur the setting for the enchanting ""Priceless"" which calls to mind Lubitschs ""Trouble in Paradise"" and beguiles all the way from the parade of umbrellas decorating the opening titles to the closing credits. Irene (the delectable Audrey Tautou) a gold-digger of no mean skills has all but bagged a free-spending middle-aged geezer. The deal becomes no deal when Irene mistakes a shy unprepossessing hotel factotum Jean (Gad Elmaleh) for a millionaire. When she learns the truth Irene swiftly and spitefully works her way through Jeans meager bank account in one instance ordering caviar though she loathes the stuff then abandons the poor love-struck sap. The two meet again when Irene has snared another deep-pocketed gent at a tony hotel and Jean reaping the benefits of another misapprehension is in residence as the boy toy of a well-fixed and well-preserved widow. Hilariously gigolette begins giving gigolo tutorials in the most effective ways of scoring swag like motor bikes and jewel-encrusted watches. These methods include seductive glances sulks (civilizations were built on less than Ms. Tautous pout) and halting half-finished sentences. Tawdry? Not for a minute. Credit a subtle and souffle-light script. The services rendered by Irene and Jean are implied rather than observed. Admittedly however the foreplay -- in the form of shopping montages -- is as explicit as can be Strappy Chanel heels are fondled as theyre being swaddled in tissue paper; price tags are snapped off dresses and pocketbooks with more enthusiasm than button-popping in the boudoir. 21 At their best movies set in the choice precincts of Las Vegas -- the roulette wheel the slot machines and the blackjack table -- give viewers a vicarious kick. Eagerly they wait for the answer to the eternal question Will the hero hit the jackpot or hit the skids? Then there is the Las Vegas-centered ""21"" which regrettably is far more ""Oliver"" than ""Oceans 11"" with Kevin Spacey as a mash-up of Fagin and Bill Sykes. Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is an intellectually gifted socially awkward senior at M.I.T. with only one thing standing between him and Harvard medical school the 300000 tuition fee. The 8 per hour Ben makes as assistant manager of a mens clothier would barely cover the cost of a lab coat and though hes applied for a prestigious scholarship the competition is fierce. The qualifying interviews for the grant serve as ""21""s framing device. Bens anorexic bank account makes him easy picking for math professor Micky Rosa (Mr. Spacey) who when he isnt teaching statistics is recruiting the best and the brightest students teaching them how to count cards (a technique that the movie never succeeds in explaining clearly) then setting them loose to shake up and shake down the Vegas blackjack tables. Though initially hesitant Ben is won over by the lure of easy money and the allure of a beautiful teammate (Kate Bosworth whos both too old and too model-pretty for the part). The script is adapted from the bestselling ""Bringing Down the House."" But rather than go the way of its source material a saga of canny undergrads triumphantly sticking it to the man the makers of ""21"" chose the cautionary-tale approach. The result is a none-too-winning blend of the unsettling -- college kids themselves barely 21 caught in the crosshairs of a thuggish casino security chief (Laurence Fishburne) -- and the unsurprising. Ben comes equipped with the requisite geeky friends and travels a well-worn cinematic path from sin to redemption. Very little adds up in ""21."" Why considering the risks of the enterprise would Micky and minions not spread their trade around -- go to Atlantic City Foxwoods Mohegan Sun every once in a while rather than returning weekend after weekend to Vegas? If the professor (a former professor in ""Bringing Down the House"") has done so well moonlighting why does he continue to teach? Does this guy actually have tenure? DVD TIP In William Wylers beautifully handled multi-Oscar winner ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1947) three soldiers -- played by Fredric March Dana Andrews and Harold Russell -- return home from World War II to wildly divergent welcomes.

Directed by Robert Luketic. With Jim Sturgess Kate Bosworth Kevin Spacey. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. THREE AND A HALF STARS Kevin Spacey is playing a snake again and I couldnt be happier. One of the greatest pleasures of 90s movies was watching Spacey size up a co-star focus his hard bright eyes on him and then -- gleefully -- pounce. From ""Swimming with Sharks"" to ""L.A. Confidential"" ""The Usual Suspects"" to ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" Spacey was as deadly and dazzling as a cobra. Then he won a Best Actor Oscar for ""American Beauty"" playing a nasty guy who -- at the very last possible moment -- changed. And after that Spacey changed. Suddenly he played good guys. He played sensitive sad sacks. He played scarred martyrs. He played Bobby Darin for heavens sake and a comic Lex Luthor. And all those dark wonderful memories began to disappear. So Im happy to say that in ""21"" Spacey is back and as hissable as ever. This time hes a card shark and M.I.T. professor with a scheme to beat the house at blackjack. All he needs are five accomplices with heads for numbers -- and on that campus theyre not hard to find. Soon theyre in Vegas counting cards and winning big while he sits back and smiles. And while deep in the casinos basement the head of security watches his cameras and frowns and waits. Spacey isnt just a supporting actor here but one of the producers along with major players Brett Ratner and Mike De Luca; unfortunately like a lot of powerful producers theyve stacked the deck. The amiable director of record Robert Luketic is best known for ""Legally Blonde""; since then he made ""Monster-in-Law"" and ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton"" Not the sort of filmmaker likely to fight the money men for ""my vision."" Truth is though he doesnt seem to have much of one. Right from the start -- the standard helicopter shot over water ending in a city skyline -- this is a movie as easy to read as one of those blackjack hands. Stylistic cliches (a shot of our heroes walking in slow-motion toward the camera) abound; small nagging plot holes (why do they keep going to the same casinos? why only Vegas?) are ignored. But this movie like the garish gambling parlors its set in isnt about quiet logic and sober sense -- or even directorial flair. Its a producers movie about flash and fun. And more than most movies its about wish fulfillment and vicarious pleasure not a sermon on obsession or greed. The model here is the cynical ""Risky Business"" not the sardonic ""California Split""; the real case the story is based on has been highly fictionalized. The actors are mostly winners though particularly Jim Sturgess -- the McCartney clone from ""Across the Universe"" -- as our naive hero and Kate Bosworth as the girl most likely to lead him astray. And Laurence Fishburne -- who has clearly studied at the Robert De Niro school of casino management -- is a scarily commanding presence as the security chief. But this is really Spaceys picture from the moment he fixes his gaze on Sturgess to the day when he finally brutally cuts him loose. Its a fun performance but a quiet one -- Spacey learned long ago that intimidation comes not from volume but from singleness of purpose. At his scariest moments he simply gets still speaking quickly and not moving an inch. Because you are not worth wasting a pause on or a particle of sweat. No actor wants to be typecast. Every one wants to think he can play a variety of parts and Spacey -- who has years of sterling performances in ONeill under his belt -- has proved that countless times on stage. But the movies need their bad guys too. And it is a pleasure to see one of the finest snarling from the screen once more. Rating note The film contains brief nudity violence strong language and substance abuse. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

As Thomas embarks on a new lineup tonight in Orlando for Team Titanic II supposed franchise center Eddy Curry could be headed to the bench. Offseason acquisition Zach Randolph could land there too. Its Thomas last desperate attempt to right the sinking ship. More bad news came when Stephon Marbury missed last nights flight to Orlando after suffering through an emotional first Christmas without his father. Marbury who has been on and off bereavement leave since his father died more than three weeks ago will miss tonights game in an excused absence. Veteran Malik Rose is concerned the lineup changes could cause some guys to become more disillusioned than they already are. ""Whatever changes he makes its from a standpoint of winning"" Rose said. ""Its not going to be personal. I hope guys dont take it that way. It could make players disgruntled but I believe wholeheartedly its strictly from winning. Its not like he doesnt like that player he changes. If I thought that Id think he didnt like me for benching me 30 games."" Rose has sat on the bench for most of the season and stewed at the lack of competitive spirit the Knicks have shown. On Sunday after helping lead the Knicks comeback in the Lakers loss when they whittled a 25-point lead down to one with his stout defense he couldnt keep it inside any longer and said his teammates have accepted their losing fate - a jarring admission. ""Theres got to be a point where you get tired of this happening"" Rose said. ""No one in particular but this locker room is content with getting beat. No one is getting to the point where it s like Screw this or If it happens again its not going to be on my watch. Until we get that attitude that fire that fight were going to have one good game at a time."" The Knicks (8-19) at a season- worst 11 games under .500 havent been this bad since Larry Brown ran the original Team Titanic into the ground with a 23-59 clip. The Knicks situation appears beyond hopeless but owner James Dolan allowed the Bulls to make a splash on Christmas Eve firing their coach Scott Skiles after three straight playoff appearances while Thomas keeps floating along. It is inconceivable to imagine - if the Knicks continue to lose at this pace - that Thomas doesnt recommend he go upstairs and have someone like Herb Williams coach the club. Once the fans stop filling the Garden in mid- January it would seem the only course of action. At this mornings shoot-around Thomas will unveil a new starting lineup that is not expected to feature Curry and may not even include Randolph. David Lee appears a lock to go in and with Thomas bent on making the starting lineup more defense-oriented it isnt out of the question he promotes Rose to start in Orlando. Just to make a point. ""Id love to play"" Rose said. ""Ive been wondering when since I got traded here. Thank God Ive been able to temper my emotions and stay ready. If its me Ill give everything I have on the court. I might not be as effective offensively as some guys in this locker room but Ill compete."" The Knicks are 8-19 despite playing 16 games at home and 11 on the road. For all of Thomas beliefs the Garden is an impossible homecourt advantage his team is a wreck on the road. They have not won a legitimate road game this season. Their 1-10 road record includes as its lone win in the Meadowlands where as many Knick fans as Net fans gather and to which the team buses the day of the game. And during that victory Jason Kidd called in sick. Despite the host of changes the Knicks didnt conduct a Christmas practice for the second year in a row. Curry the franchise center expected to head to the pine believes the time away was perfect. ""This day off is going to be good for everybody"" Curry said. ""Coaches included to kind of get away from it a little bit be around your family just get a break. Its just a day but a day helps."" Seven days ago Thomas admitted in a ""couple of weeks"" it would be OK to question whether he deserves the boot if things arent better. Things arent better. And the question of Thomas job security lingers. ""Thats a better question in a couple of weeks"" Thomas said. ""Not today but in a couple weeks that would be a fair question. ""Well see if we can come out of this. If we cant come out of this then those are fair questions. Theres still a lot of basketball left in the season. There is time to turn it around."" Time is running out. marc.bermannypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Filed under new york knicks Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Christmas gifts Read Next Christmas gifts Share Selection Columnists Joel Sherman MLB insiders skeptical Marlins go-for-it trade was worth it Steve Serby Ryan Fitzpatrick reconnects with Brandon Marshall -- and its beautiful SEE ALL COLUMNISTS The Post Line MLB Friday Favorite Money Line Underdog MIAMI 110-120 St. Louis NEW YORK 143-153 Colorado Philadelphia 138-148 ATLANTA MILWAUKEE 100-110 Pittsburgh Los Angeles 180-195 Arizona Washington 148-158 SAN FRANCISCO SAN DIEGO 110-120 Cincinnati TORONTO 123-133 Baltimore TAMPA BAY 108-118 New York CLEVELAND 145-155 Oakland Houston 105-115 DETROIT TEXAS 123-133 Kansas City Chicago 127-137 MINNESOTA Boston 158-170 Los Angeles Interleague CHICAGO CUBS 158-170 Seattle See All Most Popular Today 1 How Hillary blew her big moment Bloombergs DNC speech blindsided Trump campaign Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza Theyre making lingerie for dudes now The real reason Ed Hartwell split from Keshia Knight Pulliam More Stories pagesix Harry Brant busted for drugs and bailing on taxi fare Now On Decider This Woman Giving Birth In A Stream Has Been Watched Over 54 Million Times (NSFW) nypost How Hillary blew her big moment New York Post Twitter Facebook Instagram Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Twitter Facebook Instagram Sections amp; Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters amp; Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ amp; Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network (c) 2016 NYP Holdings Inc.

Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday June 4 2008 347 PM 21. Based-in-truth drama about collegiate card counters who make millions playing blackjack. With Jim Sturgess Kevin Spacey Kate Bosworth. Director Robert Luketic (158). PG-13 Violence sexuality partial nudity. At area theaters.A rousing account of college kids who briefly ruled the Vegas blackjack tables Ben Mezrichs 2002 best seller ""Bringing Down the House"" was tailor-made for the movies. ""21"" is based on Mezrichs tale but for the most part what happens in the book stays in the book. Apparently convinced that fiction trumps truth director Robert Luketic deals out a losing hand built on too many needless cliches. Given that the story is already so cinematic its hard to say why Luketic - and screenwriters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb - felt impelled to improve reality by lacing it with so much fantasy. Still at least the basic plot remains generally unchanged Introverted MIT undergrad Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is recruited to join a supersecret group led by charismatic professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey). Rosas students including Jill (Kate Bosworth) and Choi (Aaron Yoo) are brilliant card counters who spend their weekends making obscene amounts of money in Las Vegas. Ben is a little concerned about the ethics of all this. But he needs money to go to Harvard Medical School and professional gambling definitely beats his soul-deadening job at a clothing store. So before long hes blowing off his studies raking in easy cash and living the high life. Though Rosa has his players don costumes and learn secret signals while affecting innocence Bens earnings dont go unnoticed by a sharp-eyed security guard named Cole (Laurence Fishburne). And once the team is on Coles radar its only a matter of time before everything implodes. The early scenes are flashy fun and Sturgess (handsome Jude in ""Across the Universe"") makes a convincing math geek. But the requisite romance and Hollywood-style ending feel as fake as the air allegedly pumped into casinos to revive flagging players. Theres enough action here to keep you awake but dont expect to walk away a winner.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 17057421 Movie review Cash out before hitting 21 A riveting card-counting movie? Dont bet on it.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune March 28 2008 -- 933am Photo courtesy Columbia Pictures Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth in ""21"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Could there be a more visually tedious kind of con game to watch than blackjack card-counters? Unless Hollywood gives us a tale of devil-may-care stamp forgers ""21"" will own the title as the crime snoozefest of the decade. The film tracks a team of MIT students using their math skills to fleece some of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas. Their elaborate counting system the sneaky cues they use to communicate and their weekend trips to Nevada are coordinated by Prof. Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey now more than ever in need of a comeback). The teacher invites his brightest scholars into a hush-hush players club where he tutors them in devious dealings like Fagin with algorithms. Theres no law against card-counting he reassures them. What he fails to add is that theres no guarantee that casino goons wont drag you to a basement and smack your face into ground chuck if you win too much. Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) a cash-strapped MIT senior applying to Harvard Med School is our narrator and guide through a schematic three-act rise-fall-and-redemption saga. Short about 300000 for tuition (where are those Pell grants when you need them?) the guileless Ben signs on to the scheme. Hell walk away when he saves enough for his school fees he insists. Inevitably though the high-roller lifestyle sinks its talons into him. Ben rejects his longtime science-geek friends and trades his denim for designer suits. Worse he begins a hubris-fueled betting streak that alienates his gambling teammates and draws the attention of tough-guy security chief Cole Wilson (Laurence Fishburne). Sturgess is flavorless as the easily corrupted hero; his romance with fellow cardsharp Kate Bosworth is about as passion-filled as a trip to the 99-cent buffet. The film also suffers from serious gaps of logic. With Spaceys Rosa all but flicking a forked tongue every time he speaks youd expect Ben to put his piles of newfound cash in a safe deposit box. Instead he secretes it in his dorm rooms ceiling tiles. Pretty dumb for an MIT boy. 21  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for language and some violence. Robert Luketic the man who gave us ""Monster-in-Law"" directs with a serious case of personality-deficit disorder. You never feel hes offering a significant insight or putting his own stamp on the material. His vision of Vegas is generic glitz glitter and neon with no appreciation of the exquisitely weird folks who inhabit it. To dramatize the fateful turning of cards he shoots them in screen-swallowing close-ups accompanied by ""Ka-Thooms"" that would sound more at home in a superhero movie. Betting chips swell into mountains or dwindle in fast-motion montages. For all the money swirling through the story ""21"" is penny-ante entertainment.

The ace undergrad at the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the central character in ""21"" Ben is already a shoo-in to be admitted. But this son of a Boston widow played by Jim Sturgess cant swing the tuition. ""The scholarship will go to someone who dazzles"" says an Ivy League administrator. On his desk a small nude figurine head resting on a hand reclines as if to say ""Go head tell a tale that seduces me.""  RATING | Drama ""21"" is about seductions of the easiest sorts. This is its problem. Loosely based on Ben Mezrichs best seller ""Bringing Down the House The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who took Vegas for Millions"" the film is about a group of MIT students who used a very smart card-counting system to milk the casinos. But the movie blows off the deeper thrills of its source material to make a tidier less compelling amorality play. When Ben wows MIT professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) the teach begins some hard recruiting of the numbers savant for the card-counting team of brainiacs he wants to send to Las Vegas. This contemporary mod squad (actors Kate Bosworth Aaron Yoo Liza Lapira Jacob Pitts) role-play and then play. They return with hundreds of thousands stuffed into their undies velcroed beneath their shirts. Bosworth is Jill the very bright daughter of a gambling addict sent to convince good-looking but tentative Ben. On the other side of the values seesaw sit Bens best buddies Miles and Cam (Josh Gad and Sam Golzari). The trio are at work on a project for a science prize when Ben folds. At first Ben isnt interested in the scheme. Then he is. Then hes in deep. Although card-counting isnt illegal casinos take a very dim very muscular view of it. And the film begins with his foreshadowing voice-over ""I have a gifted mind and thats what got me into this mess."" Laurence Fishburne is Cole Williams a dour casino security specialist driven by as dire a need as Ben His old-school services are being phased out replaced by biometrics-scanning technology. But can a string of computer code put rings on a fist and cold-cock-convince a guy into leaving Las Vegas? We didnt think so. Williams searches close-circuit feed for cheater-tells counters signals and so forth. Eventually he sees something suspect in the nice young woman who folds her hands behind her back and the dark-haired guy who sidles up to the table. She bets modestly. He goes for the gusto. When that becomes unwise she or another spotter on the team will run a hand through her hair. Get out now. At its finest -- too late in the third act to make it a bona fide winner -- ""21"" is more chess match than blackjack showdown. Spacey and Fishburnes characters treat Ben as a pawn in a long-standing rivalry. And the veteran actors trump the team of young performers in ways that suggest a stacked deck. Spacey who bought the rights to Mezrichs book and is one of the films producers exudes his typical onscreen confidence. Standing in front of his MIT students Micky exhibits the performing prowess involved in good teaching. For a moment hes John Housemans high-and- mighty instructor of the ""Paper Chase"" for a new generation. Only the paper being chased here is decidedly green.

And its true. Read Bringing Down the House the Ben Mezrich book. Director Robert Luketic and screenwriters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb did and while 21 glams things up and hams things up it still makes for a glossy engrossing yarn. A title that refers to the winning blackjack score and the average age of the Cambridge Mass. cardsharps involved 21 centers around Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) a mild-mannered brainiac recruited by a team of fellow M.I.T. students for their ""club."" The groups main activity involves jetting to Vegas on weekends checking into swank hotels under fake names and employing an elaborate system of signals and card-counting codes to beat the dealers and stack up the chips. Math professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) - a popular teacher with a wisecracking wit - is the mastermind and Ben a nice guy looking for the 300000 he needs to get through Harvard medical school signs on - lured by the flirty entreaties of teammate Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) and the flattery of Rosa who tells Ben ""Your brain is like a . . . Pentium chip"" Using quick cuts whirling camerawork and some snazzy CGI Luketic manages to do something that directors Curtis Hanson and Martin Campbell could not in their respective gambling pics (Lucky You Casino Royale). That is make the card-table sequences exciting. Sturgess the English actor from Across the Universe plays the affable Yank with easy charm and as Ben gets sucked into the fast and seemingly foolproof blackjack scheme the audience is with him and then anguishes over his corruption as he shrugs off his nerdy best buddies and - say it aint so - lies to his mother. Bosworth who starred in Luketics cotton candy rom-com Win a Date With Tad Hamilton doesnt have much to do apart from looking cool and hot in various wigs and wardrobe changes. Spacey one of the films producers gets progressively less believable as the plot thickens and as his dialogue takes on the conventions of a double-crossing thriller. Aaron Yoo is amusing as the numbers whiz Choi Liza Lapira is likewise likable as the other femme team member and Jacob Pitts is appropriately arrogant as Fisher a rival for Bens spot and for the respect of the professor. Laurence Fishburne gets to play the heavy in a heavy-handed subplot involving an old-school casino security firm and its eagle-eyed surveillance honcho - who finally catches on to what Ben and his gang are up to. With its copter shots of Vegas by night a PG-13 peek at pole-dancers and a soundtrack that includes MGMT Peter Bjorn and John and the Rolling Stones ""You Cant Always Get What You Want"" 21 makes for some slick escapist fantasy. Even if and because the fantasy has its roots in something real. 21  (out of four stars) Directed by Robert Luketic. With Jim Sturgess Kate Bosworth Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne.

"21 Is Stuck With a Losing Hand washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +| Comments 21 Is Stuck With a Losing Hand Greed isnt good. Or is it? The message is muddled in the tale of card-counting in Sin City (with Kate Bosworth and Jim Sturgess). (By Peter Iovino -- Columbia Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 28 2008 The movie ""21"" offers the appealing notion that success is just a matter of number crunching and calculation. Learn to count the cards in Vegas and youll never hurt for money again. This StoryMovieMakers Two of a Kind Adds Up to 21Review 21 Is Stuck With a Losing HandFind 21 Showtimes Oh wait theres a corollary You have to be an exceptional MIT student. Welcome to a slick but resoundingly empty movie in which mental agility beauty and brilliance are a sort of moral base line for the cast which includes Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth two performers who exude vigor youth beauty and gently buffed immortality. The master of proceedings is Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) MIT professor by day gambling entrepreneur by night who recruits six of his best and brightest students -- very hush-hush and secret handshake -- to fly to Sin City on weekends and cheat themselves rich. (Well technically what theyre doing isnt illegal but management does have the right to escort you into the basement and beat you into a pulp -- as just about every movie on this subject from ""Casino"" to ""The Cooler"" never fails to show.) Like a junior ""Mission Impossible"" team they take mental note of the cards played and assess the probability of what will turn up next. And they communicate with one another in a language of subtle gesture and coded conversation. ""This table is hot."" ""The heat is coming -- get out fast"" Then its off to the hotel room to toast their haul divvy up the payload then head back to class. But whose side are they on? Not ours. In fact the group is such a secret society -- Skull and Bones with algorithm skills arrogance and sexy hair -- that the audience feels completely left out. When theyre not hot-dogging their academic chops before a beaming Micky in the classroom theyre plotting strategies to reap the financial rewards they believe their special talents deserve. And even though the movie presents them as American dreamers who stand up to The Man its hard to throw them a high-five. Its easier to connect with the security goons (led by Laurence Fishburne) waiting to pinch them. At least those guys are wage earners who believe in the dumb luck of whirring lemons plums and bars. The filmmakers seem to understand this potential disconnect but they dont solve the problem. Yes Ben Campbell (Sturgess) is a sweet lower-middle-class kid who has dreamed all his life of going from MIT to Harvard med and who accepts Mickys invitation into the circle only to put himself through his dream school. Unfortunately this characterization feels too saintly too schematic. Nice guy at the tables Learning the dark arts until his tuition bills are cleared Will he learn the true path before they lead him into that dingy basement -- the one with the exposed pipes the dripping water and the nasty guy with knuckle-dusters? Sturgesss aw-shucks likability (which he demonstrated in ""Across the Universe"" and ""The Other Boleyn Girl"") offsets some of this hackneyed material but intrinsic cuteness can only go so far. And Spacey who always seems to make something of the worst roles cant shoehorn his natural pep and alertness into that one-dimensional Machiavelli. His frustrated exertion is all we see. The story may be based on real events -- Ben Mezrichs ""Bringing Down the House The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions"" but most of it feels patently false. As directed by Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde"") ""21"" is a parade of pretty faces enjoying the good life and encountering a few familiar setbacks strategically placed before them like obstacles in a video game. We are sitting through too many unintended ironies -- a would-be parable about greed that emptily celebrates it a drama about gifted people who are one-dimensional voids and most laughable of all a story about the giddiness of risk-taking that safely plays everything by the numbers. We are ready to cash in our chips. 21 (116 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence nudity and sexual content. >> This StoryRead +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Two of a Kind Adds Up to 21 Review 21 Is Stuck With a Losing Hand Find 21 Showtimes",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032703382.html,200,2121,21,washingtonpost
"21 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 21 ) 21 (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli 21 is a perfect example of how something thats ""based"" on a true story can nevertheless exist mainly in the realm of fiction. While its true that the source material for the movie Ben Mezrichs Bringing Down the House relates events that actually happened screenwriters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb have fictionalized the entire story leaving intact only the central idea that a group of MIT students devised a card-counting scheme that allowed them to fleece the Vegas casinos. And while Im firm believer in the adage ""Never let the truth get in the way of a good story "" 21 doesnt spin a good enough yarn to justify all the changes. In fact when one character indicates to another that he started out smart then got sloppy and stupid he might have been referring to the script. Our ""entry point"" into 21 is Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) a graduating MIT senior who has already been admitted to Harvard Med School. Theres a problem though Ben cant raise the needed 300000 (never heard of student loans I guess) and his chances of getting a ""free ride"" scholarship appear slim. Along comes Professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) who brings with him a too good to be true offer a space has opened up on his ""team"" and hes offering it to Ben one of the most gifted mathematical minds he has encountered during his time teaching at MIT. The ""team"" is a group of five students who visit Las Vegas regularly and put into effect a sophisticated card-counting scheme that the casinos have been unable to break. Initially Ben refuses but the allure of Harvard Med plus his attraction to Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) one of Mickys special students pulls him in. After a local initiation its off to Sin City for Bens official induction. There waiting to match wits with him is Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) the head of security at Planet Hollywood. The idea behind 21 is compelling - tell how a group of college kids beat one of the most sophisticated anti-crime systems in place anywhere around the world. Unfortunately the problem is with the execution. Perhaps because theres math involved 21 doesnt do an effective job of providing the bare-bones details of how the crime is pulled off. It hedges and cheats and employs lots of quick edits but we dont get anything close to a coherent description of what the kids methods are. It doesnt take long before the film relegates the heist elements to the background so it can focus on clichA(c)d interpersonal relationships including a tepid romance between Ben and Jill. Finally the movie ends with a series of Hollywood staples including a chase and a ""twist"" that wont surprise anyone. 21 is yet another instance of Hollywood dumbing-down smart people. In order to pull off something as audacious and successful as what the MIT students did they had to be geniuses. Yet as portrayed in the movie theyre ineffectual blunderers. Some of the things they do are so stupid that theyre insulting. Of course these characters are eventually going to get caught doing these sorts of things. How could they not? Audiences enjoy watching heist movies where the characters are two steps ahead (not two steps behind) and where the narrative provides some surprises. Neither characteristic is evident here. And in addition the resolution has an unpleasant ""have your cake and eat it"" quality. The fingerprints of those demanding a Hollywood ending are all over this screenplay. Jim Sturgess who has survived the Beatles debacle Across the Universe relatively unscathed gives a nice turn as shy Ben who gradually emerges from his shell as he gains more confidence in his newfound skills. Its a familiar character arc but Sturgess performance allows us to buy into it. Kevin Spacey provides his customary intensity; hes fun to watch even when hes not in peak form. His Superman Returns co-star Kate Bosworth isnt as successful. Her performance is wooden and she and Sturgess dont click as a couple. Laurence Fishburne is wasted in a stereotypical thug role and no one else has enough lines to be worth mentioning. The supporting characters in 21 truly are one-dimensional. Another disappointing aspect of 21 is its sluggish pace. The high-energy Vegas setting doesnt increase the wattage of the production. The movie is a little over two hours in length but feels longer. Some of the movies last-act ""action"" sequences have been inserted primarily as a way to liven things up but theyre so pointless and derivative that all they do is drag out the running length. (Are we really supposed to be thrilled by scenes of Sturgess and Bosworth being chased by bad guys through a series of casino kitchens?) When it comes to the other two heist movies currently playing in theaters The Bank Job and Flawless the only advantage one could attribute to 21 is the youth of its cast. When judged on the basis of story excitement surprises and character development 21 comes in a distant third. 21 (United States 2008) Director Robert Luketic Cast Jim Sturgess Kevin Spacey Kate Bosworth Aaron Yoo Liza Lapira Jacob Pitts Laurence Fishburne Jack McGee Screenplay Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb based on the book Bringing Down the House by Ben Mezrich Cinematography Russell Carpenter Music David Sardy U.S. Distributor Columbia Pictures Run Time 203 U.S. Release Date 2008-03-28 MPAA Rating ""PG-13"" (Violence Profanity Sexual Situations) Genre THRILLER Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Jaws (1975) Pulp Fiction (1994) Casablanca (1943) worse movies of this genre Neon Demon The (2016) Left Behind (2014) Jade (1995) Three...better movies of Jim Sturgess Other Boleyn Girl The (2008) Cloud Atlas (2012) (There are no more better movies of Jim Sturgess) worse movies of Jim Sturgess Across the Universe (2007) Crossing Over (2009) (There are no more worst movies of Jim Sturgess) Three...better movies of Kevin Spacey Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) Bugs Life A (1998) American Beauty (1999) worse movies of Kevin Spacey Fred Claus (2007) Ref The (1993) Outbreak (1995) Three...better movies of Kate Bosworth Superman Returns (2006) Still Alice (2015) Rules of Attraction The (2002) worse movies of Kate Bosworth Win a Date with Tad Hamilton (2004) Bee Season (2005) Blue Crush (2002) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=621,200,2122,21,reelviews

They may look great in tabloid party photographs but when theyre required to suffer or to show anxiety -- that is when they have to behave like the rest of us -- theyre like automatons whove been to acting class. They turn imperfection into dull posing. Jim Sturgess the star of the college-brainiacs-go-to-Vegas drama 21 is in a different league. Its not that he isnt cute. He looks a little like the young Paul McCartney (that must be part of why they cast him in Across the Universe) with a boy heartthrobs dewy eyes and friendly puckered grin. In 21 though he attaches real live nerve endings to that pretty-boy facade. He plays Ben Campbell a math nerd at MIT whos recruited by a wry Mephistopheles of a faculty member (Kevin Spacey) to join a secret team of student blackjack wizards who head to Las Vegas on weekends to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars by counting cards. Sturgess wears his hair in a longish haphazard cut thats like a floppy helmet. Its the armor of a kid whos shy about everything but his intelligence. As Ben hes passive and slightly dorky a gummy collegiate tangle of sweetness IQ and loser psychology. Ben hangs out with a couple of geeks (together theyre building a robot) and he takes it as a fact that girls or at least the hot ones arent interested in him. But when he sits down at the blackjack tables that very hesitancy -- his reluctance to reveal himself -- works for him. His brainy reserve becomes cool a way of negotiating risk. Hes a Will Hunting who turns into James Bond. Ive never quite gotten how counting cards in blackjack works but 21 which is loosely based on the book Bringing Down the House about the experiences of MIT student Jeff Ma and his junior-gambler colleagues constructs an entertaining if simplified version of the strategy to the point that some viewers may be tempted to use the movie as a primer. Under the tutelage of math-and-stats professor Micky Rosa played by Spacey with his familiar -- but always bracing -- joy-buzzer sarcasm Ben joins the other students in an elaborate system that involves assigning a number to each table based on how many low (or high) cards have been dealt. One team member usually a girl is there to signal when a table ""heats up"" (i.e. when most of the high cards have yet to be played). At that point a designated Big Player can sit down and start winning. 21 is built around some standard-issue plot mechanics but its still a clever and novel card-sharp thriller. It draws us into Bens excitement at a luxe dreamworld that trumps college. For Ben the blackjack team is the means to an end the only way he has of making the 350000 hell need to attend Harvard Medical School. What the audience sees is that the danger of walking into a Vegas casino to beat the system gets him more jazzed than he can admit. High on his big winnings he starts to get high on everything else too like the attention of a sexy teammate -- Kate Bosworth as an ice princess at full melt. (Bosworth makes her lusciousness vivid in an underwritten role.) Hes high on sin. Counting cards is in fact perfectly legal. If the casinos catch you however theyll kick you out -- or as the film keeps reminding us break your nose. And since the ability to count cards is truly a skill not just a way of cheating (it is of course the fabled essence of what makes a great poker player) Ben is lying -- and not lying. He occupies a gray area of the sleaze zone that in the movies terms is a metaphor for his ambivalence about being a player in life. He desires it and fears it. 21 is a better realized youth thriller than say Disturbia but it has more things to niggle at than it should. When Ben gets to Vegas he and the other students are given disguises and fake identities but the movie barely follows through on this gambit -- a missed opportunity. And theres a key turning point when Spaceys prof who seems mostly amused at the scam that hes orchestrating blows up at Ben in a way I never bought. Despite its shortcomings however 21 has enough good twists to keep jolting ahead. Its too early to tell if Jim Sturgess is going to turn into Ryan Gosling or Andrew McCarthy but my bet is that he gets closer to the former. The fun of 21 is the way that this sharp hyperaware star in the making his face as readable as a mood ring pours us into an adrenalized cocktail of fear desire and mental buzz.

A flashy fictionalization of an extraordinary true-life story about college kids who counted cards to win big in Las Vegas ""21"" is a better-than-even-money bet to be an important player in the spring B.O. tournament. Pic shrewdly shuffles together attractive young leads cagey screen vets and a fantasy-fulfillment scenario in a slickly polished package that should appeal to anyone whos ever dreamed of beating the odds. Only the lack of some truly megawatt star power might hold the Sony release back from a massive rather than just lucrative payday. Sporting a reasonably convincing Boston accent Brit up-and-comer Jim Sturgess (""Across the Universe"") makes a mostly winning impression as Ben Campbell a brilliant boyishly cute but awkwardly shy math-and-science whiz who wants to attend Harvard Medical School after completing his senior year at MIT. Trouble is neither he nor his widowed mom (Helen Carey) can afford tuition. So it doesnt take much convincing to lure Ben onto a clandestine team of fellow MIT brainiacs assembled by Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey) a seductively snarky math professor and stats genius who presides over his college classes like a sardonic gameshow host. With a little help from sexy student Jill (Kate Bosworth) Mickey convinces Ben to join the high-stakes action while following the professors near-infallible system for counting cards at blackjack tables during weekend jaunts to Las Vegas. The gameplan calls for a designated ""big player"" -- either Ben or vet teammate Fisher (Jacob Pitts) -- to wait for a signal from a ""spotter"" making low-wager bets. When one of the spotters -- teammates Jill Choi (Aaron Yoo) and Kianna (Liza Lapira) -- indicates the dealer is working with a ""hot deck"" the big player comes by and bets big. And keeps on betting until the spotter signals him to vamoose. Like a more conventional caper movie ""21"" generates an impressive amount of suspense simply by meticulously explaining and then deftly dramatizing the nuts and bolts of an illicit enterprise. Spacey is darkly comical and icily authoritative as Mickey explains the rules of his game and repeatedly warns against getting too excited in the heat of the moment. Mickey makes it perfectly clear to his players that if they break his rules theyll be brutally punished. But perhaps not as brutally as they might be treated by Cole Williams (an intimidating Laurence Fishburne) a badass casino ""enforcer"" who takes a hands-on approach to discouraging card counters. Working from ""Bringing Down the House"" Ben Mezrichs bestselling account of the real-life MIT students who took Vegas for millions in the 1990s director Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde"" ""Monster-in-Law"") and scripters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb sporadically resort to predictable character developments logic-stretching plot twists and full-bore melodramatics. Its never made clear how its so easy for Mickey to impose his iron will on a player who displeases him in the third act and Bens evolution from buttoned-down nerd to ""Viva Las Vegas"" libertine while amusing is not entirely plausible in the way its dramatized (or to be more accurate announced) here. Sturgess does a first-rate job sustaining the auds rooting interest in his character even though theres conspicuously little heat to his scenes with the well-cast Bosworth. Spacey gives a performance that could be labeled ""Honey-Baked"" and sliced up for sandwiches -- which is precisely what makes him so much fun. Supporting players including Josh Gad and Sam Golzari as Bens uber-nerd best buddies are aces. The visual-effects team led by Gray Marshall employs all manner of camera techniques and CGI trickery to give many of the blackjack games the pizzazz of a state-of-the-art vidgame. (Cards and chips appear exhilaratingly surreal in massive closeups.) And that comes in very handy whenever Luketic wants to amp up the excitement during sequences where really people are doing nothing more dramatic than placing bets and playing cards. Lenser Russell Carpenter enhances pic overall with stark contrasts between snowy Boston and neon-lit Vegas locations. Soundtrack abounds with aptly chosen pop tunes although the closing credits are underscored by what may be the worst remix of a Rolling Stones song (""You Cant Always Get What You Want"") ever heard in a major motion picture. 21ProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Columbia Pictures presentation in association with Relativity Media of a Trigger Street/Michael De Luca production.
