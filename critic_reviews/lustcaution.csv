Chan Kam Chuen/Focus Features hide caption toggle caption Chan Kam Chuen/Focus Features Showmance Actress Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei right) sets out to seduce a collaborator (Tony Leung) in Lust Caution but soon her performance becomes a little too convincing. Chan Kam Chuen/Focus Features Director Ang LeeGenre ThrillerRunning Time 157 minutes (Requires RealPlayer) Theres a bit of fairly explicit lust and an awful lot of dramatic caution in this World War II epic. The plot is faintly preposterous -- a troupe of Chinese college thespians goes undercover in Hong Kong and Shanghai during the Japanese occupation hoping their ingenue (Tang Wei) can get close enough to a well-guarded collaborator (Tony Leung) to let them attempt an assassination. The ingenue falls for her target which rather complicates things. Having dealt significantly less explicitly with a different sort of forbidden love in Brokeback Mountain director Ang Lee conjures up a persuasively bustling version of 1940s China for his lovers to inhabit. But hes allowed the storytelling to stretch to 157 minutes which gets to be a bit of a slog -- copious nudity and an NC-17 rating notwithstanding.

"Lust Cautions Open Hearts Arent For Closed Minds washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Lust Cautions Open Hearts Arent For Closed Minds Tang Wei left and Tony Leung star in Ang Lees latest film on clandestine love which bares a battle between two wills in Japanese-occupied Shanghai during World War II. (By Chan Kam Chuen -- Focus Features) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 5 2007 ""Lust Caution"" a ""romance noir"" set in Japanese-occupied Shanghai makes a powerful case for love as a transcendental force that draws people together no matter how perverse audiences may deem their relationship. Director Ang Lee has created an affecting minor-key ode to love in the tradition of films such as ""The Night Porter"" ""Dance With a Stranger"" ""M. Butterfly"" and ""Damage."" In these dramas the partners are morally questionable; their love becomes their only grace note. The tighter the outside world closes around them the more they cling to one another like victims falling together from a great height. And we are torturously caught up in this feeling pity and empathy rather than condemnation. Adapted from a short story by Shanghai-born Eileen Chang who lived through (and set several novels in) this 1940s backdrop the movie unfolds like a political thriller. But its real drama occurs within the hearts of two flawed people drawn to each other despite a wartime atmosphere that casts them as adversaries. Their sadomasochistic sexual liaisons -- graphically depicted -- initially alarm us. But we come to understand how this aggressive behavior seemingly laced with hatred and contempt belies a growing emotional connection. The 50ish Mr. Yee (Tony Leung) is the ruthless debonair head of security for the collaborative Chinese government. Wang Chia-chih (Tang Wei) is a patriotic revolutionary in her 20s; she has drawn the short straw in her circle of student radicals to seduce and lure him into a deadly trap. When the inevitable affair takes place she learns she has become entangled with a sadist whose brutal bedroom manner hides a tormented tenderness. Touched instead of hardened against him she finds herself falling in love and caught in a game of double deception -- against Yee and her compatriots. In spite of the NC-17 rating Lee makes lyrical if disconcerting poetry of their cruelly drawn affair; the director did something similar when he examined a clandestine love tinged with bitterness and regret in ""Brokeback Mountain."" In this world of Mahjong parlors and opium dens where survival is the only virtue the lovers are finding their own blissful asylum. And were oddly moved by their hermetically sealed strength of purpose. In a film where casting is a vital component in the edgy equation Leung and Tang make a picturesque and dramatically compelling couple. Leung best known as a swoony icon in art house romances such as ""2046"" and ""In the Mood for Love"" is cast wonderfully against type. Suddenly his delicate almost feminine features are fraught with menace. And Tang who makes her debut firmly establishes herself as a softly persuasive screen presence for the future. In ""Lust Caution"" her combination of grim purpose and almost ethereal tenderness bring a much needed personal dimension to the tragedy. While the sexual scenes between them are explicit they are also sensitively portrayed. It is the sweaty sensuality of their thrusting bodies and the seemingly endless intensity that makes these encounters seem so licentious not the sex itself. The filmmakers including screenwriters James Schamus and Hui-Ling Wang are showing us the battle between two wills not a pornographic peep show. (This subtle distinction has eluded the ratings board of the Motion Picture Association which recently gave an R rating to ""The Heartbreak Kid"" a comedy that makes sight gags out of forceful graphic sex children snorting cocaine and even bestiality.) That something so pure as love can grow in such unseeming circumstances is testament to the one emotional state that binds most -- if not all -- of us. Lust Caution (157 minutes at Landmarks Bethesda Row) is rated NC-17 for explicit sexuality. In Mandarin Chinese with subtitles.

Friday September 28 2007 433 PM Lust Caution Period drama about an affair between a political figure and his would-be assassin in 1940s Shanghai. With Tony Leung Tang Wei Joan Chen. Director Ang Lee (237). NC-17 Graphic sexuality nudity. In Mandarin with subtitles. At Lincoln Plaza. What sounds like an alternative title to ""Brokeback Mountain"" Oscar-winner Ang Lees new film ""Lust Caution"" is a different creature altogether - not only in its period location language (Mandarin) and sexual orientation but in the effectiveness of its love story. Adapted from Eileen Changs short story ""Lust Caution"" takes us to Japanese-occupied 1940s China - first to Hong Kong then to Shanghai - where a beautiful college drama student sets out to seduce a politician/collaborator and set him up for an assassination. She succeeds in a way that she couldnt foresee by falling in love with him and facing a crisis of conscience when the time comes for the kill. There is plenty of lust exercised in the athletic dont-try-this-at-home sex scenes between Hong Kong star Tony Leung and the stunning Chinese newcomer Wei Tang. But if the adults-only NC-17 rating that the filmmakers have embraced proves anything it is that graphic sexuality is not enough to convey emotional connection. That connection is stated and is made clear outside the sexual context but speaking as one who has been extremely moved by the central relationships in every previous Ang Lee film (except ""The Hulk"" of course) I didnt feel the love between the flowering idealist and the ruthless killer. If I did I would have given the movie four stars. Everything else is wonderful - the period atmosphere the attention to detail the visual composition and the political backdrop to a part of World War II - the Chinese resistance - that we dont know enough about. Tangs Wang Jiazhi is a country girl who in her first year in college discovers her gift for acting and eagerly volunteers for the dangerous assignment offered her. To convincingly portray a married woman with a hearty sexual appetite she surrenders her virginity to a fellow conspirator and studiously practices sex until shes got all the moves down.

By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Lust Caution click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Wei Tang and Tony Leung Chiu Wai in Lust Caution After making the definitive--OK the only--gay-cowboy romance in Hollywood history what do you do next? With Lust Caution (Focus Features) protean Taiwanese director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon; The Hulk; Brokeback Mountain) does something thats unexpected and truly daring. He takes a compact gem of a short story by Chinese writer Eileen Chang and spins it into a 158-minute saga of espionage deceit sexual humiliation and something that could be perversely--but not untruthfully--called love. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The subtitled film begins in Hong Kong in 1942 as four jewel-bedecked ladies slap down tiles in a fierce-looking game of mah-jongg. In a masterful scene that crackles with unspoken tension and overlapping dialogue we infer that the youngest of the players Mak Tai-Tai (Tang Wei) is secretly involved with Yee (Tony Leung) whose wife (Joan Chen) hosts the ongoing mah-jongg group. Advertisement In an abrupt flashback to 1938 the affair takes on a political dimension Mak Tai-Tai is in fact the false identity of a college student Wong Chia Chi. After the shy girlish Wong moves the audience to tears with a speech in a patriotic play shes conscripted by the leader of a rebel group (Wang Leehom) to seduce Yee a collaborator with the occupying Japanese army and lure him to his death. For nearly an hour Lust Caution plays like an exceedingly well-made but conventional wartime spy drama. But when the student groups plans are foiled by a sudden act of violence which Lee shows us in a mercilessly protracted scene the film turns into something rawer and stranger. The moral and political boundaries--good revolutionaries here bad collaborationist guy over there--collapse as we witness the brutal tactics of both sides and as Wong and Yee slide into a sadomasochistic love affair. Their first encounter is a dizzying shell game. First Wongs calibrated performance as a coy seductress crumbles when Yee takes her with a violence bordering on rape. Then even more disturbingly the scene finishes with what feels like a mutual erotic surrender. Is Wong the consummate actress faking submission to ensnare her prey or experiencing real sexual abandon for the first time? Does Yee already suspect that his new mistress is a spy or is his taste for sexual cruelty just an inevitable byproduct of his days spent torturing prisoners? The mere fact that a sex scene can raise questions this complex points up the boldness of Lees project in Lust Caution. Most on-screen sex scenes could be replaced by a title card reading ""And then they had sex."" But when his two leads go at it Lee doesnt pan away discreetly to a lamp or show close-ups of their faces; he lets their savagely entangled bodies do the talking and we (and they) emerge from the scene with a completely changed sense of who these characters are. Whether the NC-17-rated sex scenes are ""real"" or simulated has been the object of much speculation but whatever Leung and Wei were up to on that closed set (where the 10 or so minutes of on-screen sex reportedly took more than 100 grueling hours to film) theyre doing something very real as actors. In fact this paradox--that an actor is an artist who tells the truth by lying--is central to the movie itself. Tang Wei making her film debut gives a superb and unsettling performance as a woman whose only source of power is her ability to transform herself into someone else. In one scene Wong takes refuge in a movie theater where she weeps her way through an Ingrid Bergman film. Her identification with the melodrama hints at the romantic naivete that will be her downfall and also reminds us of the college propaganda play where she first discovered her calling as a performer (and brought the audience to its feet shouting ""China will not fail""). Lust Caution is both a cannily constructed spy thriller and a grim kind of love story but it harbors no illusions about the transformative potential of either revolutionary violence or sexual passion. In the end the movie suggests both politics and love may be inseparable from the lies we tell ourselves about them. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Hate love blur in Lust Caution - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeHate love blur in Lust CautionTANG WEI STUNNING IN ANG LEES LATESTBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 10/11/2007 112913 AM PDTUpdated 10/12/2007 042908 AM PDT In the broad strokes and beautiful particularity of its bittersweet love story ""Lust Caution"" could not come from any other place but China. The obvious comparison between Ang Lees World War II tale of espionage and sexual intrigue in Shanghai and Alfred Hitchcocks 1946 spy thriller ""Notorious"" is both understandable and inapt. Just as Ingrid Bergmans character must wed and bed a Nazi in ""Notorious"" in ""Lust Caution"" Wong Chia Chi - the mah-jongg Mata Hari played by newcomer Tang Wei - is embedded in an affair with a member of the traitorous puppet government collaborating with the Japanese. But any similarity between the two films ends with their view of romance. Bergmans character draws back from it becomes embroiled in a cynical deception and finally is saved by love. At a similar threshold in ""Lust Caution"" - which comes long after the picture has earned both its title and its NC-17 rating - Wong accepts that she will never know if she loves Mr. Yee (Tony Leung) the traitor she is trying to kill or hates him. Standing at the precipice of love staring into a terrifying abyss she hurls herself in. Playing a university student who unexpectedly finds herself in the bed of one of the most feared and despised men in occupied China Tang summons a performance that is both acute and brave. For the film to work its vital that her character never see herself as a victim of Mr.Advertisement Yees lust but as its source. And whether in a fitted sapphire dress an assassins trench coat or in no wardrobe at all Tang has a screen presence as beguiling and heartbreaking as any of the worlds best young actresses. Its the vulnerability she projects - and the depravity she accepts in the movies explicit love scenes - that make her performance memorable. In the first film role of her career Tang Wei is unmistakable as the star of one of the best pictures of the year. It may not look like it at first however. ""Lust Caution"" starts slowly and its 2 hour 38 minute running time is likely to prove more problematic to American audiences than its sex scenes. Lee has set the opening mah-jongg action at a leisurely pace allowing the wives of officials from the government that collaborated with Japan during the war to explain with their gossip what was going on in Shanghai in 1942. But these elegantly-dressed women are sometimes hard to tell apart and have names that will be almost indistinguishable to Western audiences - Yee Tai Tai Ma Tai Tai and Mak Tai Tai - as they flash by amid the subtitles. Its less important to know who is saying what in this scene than to pay attention to their petty concerns - they like to compare the sizes of their diamond rings - while their countrymen are starving in the streets. And to recognize the emergence of two of the films dominant players  Yee Tai Tai (Joan Chen) who is better known as Mrs. Yee wife of the governments despised security chief Mr. Yee.  Mak Tai Tai (Tang) supposedly the wife of a prosperous black market trader is really Wong Chia Chi an actress from a university theater company who has infiltrated the wives group to help assassinate Mr. Yee.  Ma Tai Tai and Hsiao Tai Tai If you can figure out which one is which ignore them. They are Tai Tais of no importance. Lee comes perilously close to turning the first third of his movie into a beautifully decorated decorous snooze. What finally rouses the film from its torpor is a brutally violent scene which takes place at the house where Wong and her confederates have been hatching their plot. The reason the scene matters isnt simply that in cinematic terms violence solves everything. Until a member of Mr. Yees staff threatens the actors with exposure theyre all talk. The occupation has turned Shanghai into a bad dream and everyone in it seems to exist in a trance. The violence is awful at first then becomes so extreme its almost comical. But Lee has pitched the scene with such furious stark brutality to make it a transforming character moment for the young conspirators. Until now the plotting has been a form of acting political theater in which the girl and the others express their patriotism with empty threats. Now each of them in turn confronts the reality of murder for the first time. The conspiracy actually has two lives appearing to end when Mr. Yee and his wife flee to Hong Kong and being revived after his return to Shanghai. Reprising her role Wong meets Mr. Yee at a geisha house for Japanese soldiers and sings a song of subjugation inviting his cruelty. She believes that she despises him but she isnt sure anymore.

Tang Wei left and Tony Leung star in Ang Lees epic drama Lust Caution. Photo Focus Features Image 2 of 2 Wang Leehom stars in Ang Lees follow-up to Brokeback Mountain the NC-17 rated Lust Caution Wang Leehom stars in Ang Lees follow-up to Brokeback Mountain the NC-17 rated Lust Caution Photo Focus Features Lust Caution 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The simplistic literalism of Lust Cautions title is the only thing amusing about it. Otherwise Ang Lees long slow follow to Brokeback Mountain is a quietly compelling drama of hidden desperation and fierce passions. Much like 2005s brilliant Sophie Scholl about student anti-war activists in Nazi Germany Lust Caution puts fervent novices in a deadly game of covert defiance. This time the setting is Japanese-occupied Shanghai early in World War II. There eager young members of the Chinese resistance scheme to assassinate Yee (Tony Leung) a sinister Chinese official who serves Japanese masters with ruthless expedience. Beyond his lusts for power and women Yee has ample caution. Outside the sedate home where his wife (Joan Chen) passes the war playing mahjong he deftly navigates minefields of treachery while quelling the resistance with extreme prejudice. To maneuver him into its bulls-eye resistance agents send Wang (newcomer Tang Wei) a young woman who poses as a Hong Kong businessmans wife while visiting Yees home. By patiently seducing him she hopes to get his guard down so assassins can strike. The only trouble is Wang goes native. Her earnest male colleagues are like whimpering pups compared to Yees steely resolve and though she keeps her eye on the prize shes compromised by lusts of her own. The subtitled films 157-minute length is daunting but it is after all an epic. The period details and cinematography are strong the lovely score is haunting and the lead actors inhabit their roles given room to breathe by Lees sustained takes. Sex scenes have a raw abandon and near-explicitness -- enough to draw an NC-17 rating. Yet again the ratings board shows more intolerance of human sexuality than any degree of inhuman violence. Though Lust Caution will gain notoriety for its sex its no Red Shoe Diaries of polished sensationalism. Instead its a sobering look into the hearts and minds of those facing upheaval with their own personal wars of survival. If Wang werent so captured by Yees cold charisma her task would be easier. But war has a way of heightening passions with lust gaining an edge on caution. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals 2 Reach Ultra Clean Toothbrushes for 1 + pickup at Target Clearance Patio Furniture and Decor at Lowes Up to 50% off Carbon Fiber Pattern Case for iPhone 6/6 Plus for 1 + free...

"Lust Caution Love in the house of spies | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLust Caution Love in the house of spies""If you pay attention nothing is trivial"" a character says in Ang Lees Lust Caution. Its advice worth heeding in appraising this smouldering achievement.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 5 2007   (out of 4)Starring Tony Leung Chiu Wai Tang Wei Joan Chen and Wang Lee-Hom. Directed by Ang Lee. 157 minutes. At the Varsity. 18A Article Continued Below ""If you pay attention nothing is trivial"" a character says in Ang Lees Lust Caution. Its advice worth heeding in appraising this smouldering achievement.The Taiwanese auteur follows the triumph of Brokeback Mountain with another story of illicit love this time a World War II saga set in his native Asia.Its a thriller that seems determined not to thrill. The measured pace of its 2 1/2-hour running time rarely sets the pulse racing even in the explicit but relatively brief sex scenes that have earned the film an audience-limiting NC-17 rating stateside.Compare it to Paul Verhoevens recent Black Book also set in WWII and with a similar story about a female resistance fighter working undercover by sleeping with the enemy. The bedroom scenes in Verhoevens film were more discreet but the action rarely flagged.Lees deliberate pacing begs us to note the slow accumulation of details. The film opens with a mah-jong game heavy with portent. Its a symbol hell return to. Its 1942 in the section of Shanghai that houses the collaborationist government under the rule of Japanese invaders. The mah-jong players chat about the difficulties of obtaining luxuries during wartime. Mrs. Yee (Joan Chen) is in charge of the mah-jong match. Shes the wife of Mr. Yee (an award-worthy Tony Leung Chiu Wai) a leading official in the collaborationist government known for his brutal efficiency.The youngest mah-jong participant played by the extraordinary newcomer Tang Wei describes her absent husband as an import/export broker. Shes really the unmarried Wang Jiazhi an agent of the patriotic Chinese resistance movement and part of a plot to assassinate Mr. Yee. Wang has spent four years orchestrating this moment.The clock rolls back to the Hong Kong of 1938. A younger Wang is with a group of girls waving to Chinese soldiers who are heading out to battle the Japanese. Wang later joins a theatre troupe at school mainly because shes attracted to its handsome director Kuang (Lee-Hom Wang). She discovers the troupe is more interested in making radical change than learning stage lines.She is inducted into the resistance and given the dangerous assignment of getting to the fanatically cautious Yee through the only area of his life hes thought to be vulnerable the bedroom.Wang knows this will mean having sex with Yee even though she is a virgin. She is undaunted even when required to practice intercourse with clumsy male resistance fighters.The plan nearly comes undone when Yee moves to Shanghai to become head of the secret service.But Wang is too involved now to give up. She moves also and embarks on an odyssey of rough sex - Yee is both sadist and masochist - and risky espionage that will change her life and possibly alter history.There are repeated references to other movies within Lust Caution and scenes inside darkened cinemas. Its as if Lee and his writers Hui-Ling Wang and James Schamus working from a story by Eileen Chang want to underscore the air of unreality.But events are all too real to Wang who has tragically had to sacrifice dreams of true love to spy for her country.She now finds herself inexplicably falling for Yee whom she recognizes as a frightened man who has sold his soul to save his skin.When she upbraids him for treating her like a prostitute he counters with the sad admission ""I know better than you how to be a whore."" Lust Caution demands careful attention and possibly a repeat screening to fully appreciate its many nuances which include superior cinematography and production values.Its a masterpiece of tangled allegiances and corrupted innocence equating sexual intimacy with the search for a persons soul.

Directed by Ang Lee from a screenplay by Wang Hui Ling and James Schamus based on the short story by Eileen Chang. 159 minutes. Rated NC-17 (contains sexuality and nudity; no one under 18 admitted). In Mandarin Chinese with English subtitles. Egyptian. Eileen Changs short story ""Lust Caution"" about a young woman who enters a dangerous game of espionage in 1940s occupied Shanghai is written with a quiet precision; its sentences sparkle like the diamonds on the fingers of the mahjong-playing ladies who open and close the story. Ang Lees film adaptation scripted by Wang Hui Ling and James Schamus fills in whats not said in Changs prose; its an explicit leisurely opening-out of an understated tight story. Like the two opposing forces in the title (a theme in Lees work ""Sense and Sensibility"" ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"") the book and the film compliment and balance each other; each is in its way a rich experience. Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei in a luminous film debut) is a student actress at a Hong Kong university happily dazzled by the unexpected rush of stage performance. Falling in with a group of student rebels she soon puts her acting skills to use Posing as an elegant but unhappy wife she catches the cold eye of Mr. Yee (Tony Leung Chiu-wai moody and dark) a government official and target of the students assassination plot. Their eventual affair is both passionate and chilling; shes performing without the safety of a curtain coming down. Though ""Lust Caution"" in prose is a story of sex and transformation its bedroom scenes are discreetly shielded. When Wong learns that in order to be convincing to Mr. Yee she must lose her virginity to one of the student rebels Chang conveys the event with a quiet ""And so the show went on."" Lee instead shows us the moment -- the grimness of her face the mechanical quality of this strange ""rehearsal"" -- revealing to us what she is letting slip away. The movies sex scenes between Wong and Mr. Yee are explicit deliberate and at times brutal beginning with a rape and evolving into long passages of complex intertwining. He at times looks barely present; she her lipstick turned blurry looks like shes trying not to be. ""He worms his way into my heart"" she bitterly tells her collaborators. Like ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" another elegant adaptation opening this week ""Lust Caution"" has a stately pace (its nearly 2 hours and 40 minutes) that sometimes works against it. You become all too aware of the passing of time even as youre seduced by the elegance of Lees images and sounds the precision of Wongs makeup in her disguise giving sharp focus to a young face not quite formed; the mahjong tiles delicately clicking on the table like the rapid hooves of tiny horses carrying unspoken secrets. The game goes on as the story sadly fades away; a tragedy without a final bow.

Starring Tang Wei and Tony Leung. Directed by Ang Lee. (NC-17. 158 minutes. In Mandarin with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Stylized and visually arresting with intense sex scenes that earned the film an NC-17 rating Ang Lees ""Lust Caution"" is an immersion into another time place and mentality. This capturing of an eras mentality is what makes the film more than just another exalted period piece. Set in Japanese-occupied China during World War II the film depicts people whose lives have been infected by a protracted war that permeates every aspect of life and complicates and perverts the simplest of interactions. Based on the story by Eileen Chang ""Lust Caution"" which won the Golden Lion at this years Venice Film Festival unfolds at a languorous (or cautious) pace ultimately leaving audiences with a haunted feeling. Though the film does not show combat it does present in a gradual and increasingly unsettling way wars psychological effects. The fact of the occupation is with every character at all times. Its impossible to forget and eventually that feeling gets inside the audience too that uneasy sense of there always being something to worry about some constraint on expression or behavior. The movie tells the story of an innocent young woman Chia Chi (Tang Wei) who falls in with a group of politically minded actors. When performing protest plays no longer seems important enough for them the troupe turns to Resistance work and Chia Chi goes along for the ride. She turns out to be the most valuable member of the Resistance cell the prettiest woman and thus the one most likely to seduce and unbalance the Chinese traitor Mr. Yee who is systematically destroying the Resistance. The perversion of natural impulse begins with Chia Chis initiation. A virgin assigned to play a seductive married woman whose husband is out of town Chia Chi submits to having mechanical sex with one of the Resistance members just to get the hang of what shes going to be doing with the traitor. This is the beginning of wars distortions and it becomes a running motif - people doing normal human things for twisted or wrong reasons. The whole notion that lust can go hand in hand with caution that there can be abandon and restraint simultaneously is disturbing to nature. War poisons everything. As Chia Chi Wei floats through the movie in a virtual fog of malaise and Tony Leung as Mr. Yee is stern and forbidding rarely letting the cold mask drop. No one shows all his cards including Joan Chen as Mr. Yees sly observant wife. As a consequence of all this reserve some may find ""Lust Caution"" excruciatingly dull but pay close attention - beneath the surface behind the mask of either coldness or sadness theres usually more going on. And everything thats going on explodes to the surface in the sex scenes. We now come to the paragraph that you probably skipped ahead to read the one that explains why ""Lust Caution"" got an NC-17 rating. The nudity is frontal and the simulated sex is convincing and protracted. In fact at several points Leung and Wei seem to be working through the entire Kama Sutra. But nothing about these scenes is arousing and theyre not meant to be. The director uses the sex scenes rather to document the progress of Mr. Yees journey from hostility to relaxation. He uses them to externalize Mr. Yees inner life his fear anger and frustration. You can have a character described as someone with an inability to trust others but its even more effective to see him have an orgasm without once closing his eyes. If war is the death impulse sex is the life impulse and ""Lust Caution"" has intelligent complicated and tantalizingly contradictory things to say about the power of each. Everything else in the film is either very pretty window dressing - or set dressing - or something to inform the mood (the re-creation of wartime Shanghai the period dress the hairstyles). In an environment of absolute constraint sex becomes the most honest form of expression and the most revealing form of conversation. Caution hardly enters into it. -- Advisory This film contains graphic sex scenes. To hear Mick LaSalle talk about movies listen to his weekly podcast at sfgate.com/podcasts.

"Lust Caution is an epic of espionage eroticism - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review An epic of espionage eroticism Tang Wei (left) and Tony Leung Chiu Wai star in ""Lust Caution"" Ang Lees film about Japanese-occupied Shanghai. (chan kam chuen/focus features) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  October 5 2007 ""Lust Caution"" is a disappointment coming from director Ang Lee but its a watchable one and it rattles around in your head for a long time after youve seen it as much for what it does right as for where it goes wrong.The director of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""The Ice Storm"" has gone back to his native China adapting a story by the late Eileen Chang thats a small cruel marvel of observation. Working with his longtime producing-screenwriting partner James Schamus (here co-writing the script with Wang Hui Ling) Lee has expanded Changs tale into an epic. Ironically theyve stretched the material until the nuances fall through the holes.The bulk of the film is set in Shanghai during the Japanese occupation of World War II. We meet a certain Mr. Yee (Tony Leung Chiu Wai of ""2046"" and countless other movies) who runs the local secret police torturing resistance members for information then serving them up to the Japanese.His bitchy elegant wife (Joan Chen) spends her days shopping and playing mah-jongg with her friends and only slowly do we understand that one of these friends the young Mrs. Mai (Tang Wei) is Yees lover. More slowly still do we realize shes plotting his assassination.In her story Chang tossed off the heroines background in a few acerbic pages a college drama troupe in Hong Kong students playing at being freedom fighters a mission in which a girl named Wang Chia-chih pretends to be Mrs. Mai a businessmans wife with eyes for Yee. Hes intrigued but called to Shanghai too soon and the plot collapses from inertia and amateurism.All this is preparatory to the two becoming reacquainted in Shanghai three years later but ""Lust Caution"" spends a good hour in Hong Kong watching Wang metamorphose from naive girl to tougher player. (The director also throws in a grindingly ugly murder scene just to let us know hes serious.)In Shanghai the affair between Chia-chih and Yee takes off and the film becomes about the struggle between duty and blissful sexual ravishment. The bedroom scenes are as explicit as anything Ive seen in a mainstream movie (let alone a period film set in China) and the heroine progresses from shock to willing participation knowing shes slipping down the slope to hell.Yee has his kinks - Leung plays him as a sad intelligent brute - but the girl is frightened to discover she enjoys them. The question becomes who she wants to rescue her from whom her coconspirators from Yee or the other way around? Is she an actress playing a seductress or vice versa?""Lust Caution"" lives up to its title in ways that work against it alternating truly powerful eroticism with overlong sequences of emotional repression. It would make an interesting double bill with Paul Verhoevens recent ""Black Book"" another World War II-set story about a spy in the house of love but the comparison doesnt favor Lees film which is tasteful to a fault. At what point does subtlety become inert? By my watch about 90 minutes into this 2 1/2-hour saga.In her first film Tang Wei gives a physically brave performance and a ripely emotional one but she misses the shallowness at the core of the role - her Wang Chia-chih is a flawed romantic heroine rather than a flawed woman and it throws the films final scenes out of whack.I suspect that ""Lust Caution"" may speak more eloquently to Asian audiences mindful of World War II history as they and their parents lived it and aware of the bind Wang finds herself in between fascism on one hand and an illusory freedom on the other. (A local resistance contact played by Tou Chung Hua has the glare of a future Maoist zealot.)Whatever has been lost in translation Western audiences can take solace in Changs original story (and her other writings) and in the movies lush re-creation of a morally compromised past. Lee and Schamus drop a few classic-film clues to help us find our way movie-theater shots of Cary Grant in ""Penny Serenade""; Ingrid Bergman in ""Intermezzo""; a poster for Hitchcocks ""Suspicion."" Ah got it Grant Bergman Hitchcock - this is Ang Lees ""Notorious."" Unfortunately its just not notorious enough.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

The story about a young spy for the resistance and her intended victim is remarkable for its complexity and density; its almost freeze-dried yet accessible to the imagination. In a few dozen pages Changs narrative suggests the intricacies and ambiguities of sexual and political conquest the shifting frontier between eroticism and love and the paradox of theatrical performance a process of becoming by way of pretending. The 157-minute film in Mandarin with English subtitles expands on all those themes and adds explicit sex scenes that have earned an NC-17 rating. Sumptuously produced and beautifully visualized this is a filmmakers meditation on the culture that nurtured him. As a piece of entertainment however its hoist by its own paradox -- an almost thrill-free thriller that seems seductive yet stays resolutely remote. ENLARGE The heroine Wong Chia-Chih (an impressive screen debut by Tang Wei) is a movie fan with a gift for acting that she discovered as a college student; since her story resonates with ""Notorious"" and ""Suspicion"" were treated to fleeting Hitchcock clips. (The plot is also similar to Paul Verhoevens recent and shamelessly entertaining ""Black Book."") Pressed into service by young activists who loathe the puppet government installed by Japan Wang pretends to be Mrs. Mak the wife of a Hong Kong businessman insinuates herself into the household of a brutal government official Mr. Yee and seduces him in order to set him up for assassination. Hes played by Tony Leung Chiu-Wai the Hong Kong actor who was so hypnotically soulful in ""In the Mood for Love."" This time his character conceals the existence of a soul as best he can -- the caution of the title is just as important as the lust. What he soon reveals of himself is a sexual ferocity that befits a man who does the lethal bidding of a brutal government. But Mr. Yee is not only a brute and Wong Chia-Chih is not only an apprentice pretender trying to pull off a layered role -- that of an ambitious materialistic adulteress who falls victim to her own passion. Human interactions the film says -- and by extension international relations -- are more tangled than we can know or imagine. ENLARGE Tony Leung Chiu-Wai and Tang Wei play the devious romantic couple in Ang Lees ""Lust Caution."" Theres so much to ponder in the screen adaptation by Wang Hui Ling and James Schamus that I kept wondering while watching why I found the action so uninvolving and the rhythms so repetitive. The answer for me lies in the movies relentlessly somber self-serious tone. ""Lust Caution"" is obviously not an occasion for frivolity; its about urgent purposes closed-off characters and fateful events. Still some emotional variety would have been welcome at least around the edges. Take that cell of revolutionary students the college kids who draft Wong Chia-Chih for her dangerous mission. They are in reality foolish dabblers and screw-ups who might have become overtly comic characters in an early movie by Godard. Not here though. Apart from a couple of amusing lines theyre deadly earnest and quite lifeless. And the heroines motivation is playful at first; at least thats what were told if not shown. Like many shy introspective people she discovers that acting turns her on to the point of personal liberation. Indeed the performers high is essential to the films equation. Mr. Yee too is liberated by role-playing -- his own as well as hers. Yet theres rarely a trace of zest in what she does and no relief from the impassive face he turns to the world except in their sexual encounters which are less erotic than athletic acrobatic or even geometric in their graphic intensity. A freeze-dried story has been only partially defrosted. Michael Clayton ""Michael Clayton"" with George Clooney as a world-weary fixer for a fancy corporate law firm takes a different tack in its dramatic development. Tony Gilroys film which marks his feature debut as a director seems terribly abstract at first; this is a story of disparate pieces that demands close attention. But investing ones attention pays off. The pieces come together into a stirring portrait of a man reclaiming his soul from a scrap heap of discarded principles. Mr. Gilroys script is a relatively literal-minded companion piece to ""The Devils Advocate"" a delightfully spirited fantasy that he co-wrote (and Taylor Hackford directed). But thats all right; the mind at work on this film is a sharp one and Al Pacinos earlier extravagance as Lucifer at law has its counterpart in Mr. Clooneys affecting gravity. ENLARGE George Clooney in ""Michael Clayton"" Given who Clayton was -- an assistant district attorney from a blue-collar family of cops -- and the compulsive gambler and haunted divorced father hes become he can never be a source of much extravagance. But thats provided in abundance -- in overabundance actually -- by Tom Wilkinsons performance as the law firms star litigator Arthur Edens who is brilliant but explosively bipolar. When Edens threatens in an access of grandiosity to blow the lid off the firms expensive defense of an agrochemical company U/North with blood on its hands its Michael Claytons task to reel the rogue colleague in and Claytons fate to see his own moral squalor in the mirror of Edenss principled dementia. (Sydney Pollack plays the firms co-founder a lower-key Lucifer named Marty Bach while Tilda Swinton plays U/Norths in-house chief counsel; shes no angel either.) Most of the people in ""Michael Clayton"" are on the edge and their intensity can be oppressive. So too can the incessant drumming of the sound track; its the curse of Tan Dun plus the prologue of ""NYPD Blue"" in a film of essential seriousness -- and considerable bleakness -- thats been juiced up with suspense elements and a conventional car chase. But George Clooneys film noir sensibility in the title role feels authentic and admirably solid. ""Im not a miracle worker Im a janitor"" the fixer tells a client who suddenly finds himself in a terrible fix. Be that as it may Clayton is a poignant pilgrim in warm pursuit of a state of grace.    A CORRECTION Last week I mistakenly identified the director of ""Feast of Love"" as Robert Newman. The film was directed by Robert Benton (who with David Newman wrote ""Bonnie and Clyde"" a movie I must still have too much in mind).    DVD TIP In contrast to ""Lust Caution"" a larger universe that expanded from a small short story the 98 magical minutes of Wong Kar-wais ""In the Mood for Love"" (2000) were distilled down over several years from a much longer movie that the filmmaker had originally made. Theres a lot to be said for distillation that can yield such a heady brew. The film which stars Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung as next-door neighbors in a Hong Kong apartment building in 1962 is a mood story more than a love story. Its all about sustaining a state of exquisite melancholy in the face of desire. 1 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

She - Mrs. Mak (Tang Wei) - is likewise wed or so she says. In fact she is a young woman only a few years out of university who has banded with a group of theater students-turned-resistance fighters. Her mission should she choose to accept Seduce Yee lure him from his security detail and have him killed.A rich beautifully detailed espionage thriller that captures the bygone days of Shanghai - and 1940s Hollywood noirs romantic evocations of same - Lust Caution is also one of those rare movie experiences Its scenes of the trysts between Yee and Mak from their rough-stuff first encounter to the long tangled love-making sessions of subsequent meetings are truly erotic. With an unblinking camera and bold performances by Leung and Tang these scenes - which make up maybe a dozen minutes of Lees 2 hour 37 minute drama - are not only what the film pivots on. They are what the conflicted souls played so exquisitely by Leung and Tang turn upon as well. (The scenes garnered the picture a rare NC-17 rating.)Lust Caution adapted for the screen by longtime Lee associates James Schamus and Wang Hui Ling is a story about transformation - by ideology and politics by sex and love. As good as Leung is the film belongs to Tang a mainland Chinese actress whose character Wong Chia Chi is an innocent college kid left behind by a father packed off to England. Her first transformation comes thanks to the theatrical troupe that invites her to join. Standing onstage in a fiercely pro-China production she quakes with feeling and speaks with force. The crowd goes nuts for her.Later Lee turns a couple of lovely scenes with Wong losing it at the movies weepily watching Ingrid Bergman in Intermezzo paying for a ticket for Penny Serenade.Also very good in Lust Caution is Kuang Yu Min (the Asian pop star Wang Leehom) as the leader of the theater company and of the resistance cell - a man clearly troubled by the lengths hes asked Wong to go to insinuate herself into Yees world. And troubled by his own feelings of jealousy and desire.Joan Chen in a quiet tamped-down role plays Yees wife passing her days shopping gossiping and playing endless hours of mahjong with her girlfriends - one of whom is the spy who calls herself Mrs. Mak.Suspenseful and sexy with sets costumes and cars that recall another place and time Lust Caution nonetheless has something very modern - or timeless really - going on the urgent all-consuming desire of one human for another.Lust Caution 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Ang Lee.

Hong Kong 1938. China is under the Japanese occupation. An idealistic young country girl named Wong (radiant ingenue Tang Wei) flees her village heads for the city and joins a group of actors with a national conscience to form a patriotic theater troupe at her university. The actors become a closely knit unit of friends and comrades who decide to shovel out a Chinese spy working for the enemy named Mr. Yee (Chinese superstar Tony Leung). At first its a game like one of their plays. But when the plot turns into the violent killing of one of Mr. Yees employees the humble young Wong is so devastated by what theyve done that she flees to Shanghai. But three years later shes back in the resistance resuming her pursuit of Mr. Yee who has been posted in Shanghai. No longer just a novice freedom fighter Wong boldly goes undercover with a new identity to infiltrate the mah-jongg-obsessed social fabric of Mr. Yees silly wife (Joan Chen) and her lady friends hoping to catch the wandering eye of Mr. Yee himself who has now graduated from the role of rising star in the collaborationist government to head of the secret police. Its not long before the unsophisticated Wong loses more than her virginity. Mr. Yee rapes her violently and guess what? She likes it. Enough to become his mistress. Torn between her former college friends in the underground who plan to assassinate him and the cruel sexually dominant man who holds her emotions captive Wong is in way over her pretty head with the tailored sadistic Mr. Yee. Loyalties are torn apart destiny is doomed and nobody will ever again be the same. Its not a fresh story and after all the nudity and brutal sex there isnt much of it left to tell. Its positively amazing how boring so much sex can be when it subs for character development and compelling narrative. Despite Ang Lees beautiful images and masterful glimpses into the decadence and glamour of a lost Shanghai and the limitless physical boundaries the two stars explore and then shatter Lust Caution is 157 minutes of tedium. The sex is painful and graphic without revelation (you never actually see anything) and neither of the two stars look like theyre having much fun. The outcome is predictable. Ang Lee still knows where the camera should go but do not expect Lust Caution to come anywhere close to repeating the success of Brokeback Mountain.

Wong Chai Chi (Tang Wei) a beautiful former student actress who has joined the Resistance has given away her innocence her romantic dreams and years of her life to entrap the traitor Mr. Yee (Tony Leung) the ruthless head of the Secret Service in Shanghai. Posing as a rich merchants wife she has become his mistress. Its a role shes played so deeply and so well shes begun to question her own identity her loyalties and what her true feelings are for the man shes about to lure to his death.""Lust Caution"" then loops back in time to 1939 Hong Kong unfolding on a large opulently appointed canvas that re-creates the student fervor of Hong Kong and the decadence and paranoia of pre-revolutionary Shanghai. An erotic violent melodrama filled with echoes of such Hitchcock movies as ""Notorious"" and ""Suspicion"" Lees movie is composed of one highly flammable ingredient after another. Why then doesnt it ever fully ignite? For all its hothouse passions and sometimes brutally explicit sex scenes the storytelling seems curiously stolid the style too movie-ish for its own good.Lee who won the 2006 best-director Oscar for his cowboy love story ""Brokeback Mountain"" and screenwriters Wang Hui Ling and James Schamus have taken a provocative short story by Eileen Chang and stretched it into a 157-minute epic. Its an intelligent adaptation faithful to the themes and cruel ironies of the story but the wrenching internal transformation at the heart of the tale--Wongs metamorphosis from idealistic student into a conflicted femme fatale enmeshed in a torrid sadomasochistic affair--gets overwhelmed by the overproduced melodrama that surrounds it. Theres a great piercing story here but too often you feel youre watching it through the wrong end of the telescope. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The cast gives it their all. The delicately beautiful Tang a stage and television actress from mainland China making her film debut is convincing as both a naive schoolgirl and a woman of the world never overplaying her hand. She more than holds her own with the veteran Hong Kong star Leung who makes the guarded control-freak Mr. Yee a figure of complexity and even poignancy he flexes his power with extra vehemence knowing deep down hes just a puppet to his Japanese masters. Lee perhaps thinking of Hitchcocks ""Torn Curtain"" with its famous illustration of how hard it is to kill someone stages an unforgettable variation on the theme the brutal messy protracted murder of an informer by the inexperienced young resistance team. Its certainly not the only striking explosive moment in ""Lust Caution.""

ZZZZZ By Lou Lumenick View author archive email the author follow on twitter Get author RSS feed Name(required) Email(required) Comment(required) September 28 2007 | 900am BY the time I got to the sexu ally explicit scenes in ""Lust Caution"" that earned Ang Lees disappointing follow-up to ""Brokeback Mountain"" an NC-17 rating 90 minutes had elapsed and I was struggling to stay awake. Set on meticulous sound-stage re-creations of World War II Shanghai and Hong Kong ""Lust Caution"" is an interminable suspense- and chemistry-free adaptation of a very short Eileen Chang story about a young resistance fighter who becomes the mistress of a Japanese collaborator. The story line is very reminiscent of Paul Verhoevens ""Black Book"" but Lee utterly lacks Verhoevens skill at staging action (witness ""The Hulk"") and favors the sort of languid pacing that almost did in even ""Brokeback Mountain."" The beautiful Tang Wei plays Wang Jiazhi a college drama student who is recruited to seduce Mr. Yee (Tony Leung) the ultra-cautious head of the secret service working with the Japanese occupiers. Audiences risk being lulled to sleep by a full 11/2 hours worth of false starts and flashbacks. Finally Wang - posing as the wife of a businessman has insinuated herself into the mah-jongg circle of Yees wife (Joan Chen) - manages to finally seduce him. Wangs goal is to lure Yee out in the open so a group of guerillas led by her sort-of ex-boyfriend (played by U.S.-born pop star Wang Leehom) can assassinate Yee. Unfortunately Lee and his screenwriters (Wang Hui-Ling and Lees longtime collaborator James Schamus) have turned out the sort of lumbering movie where youll figure out whats going to happen at least half an hour before it does. That doesnt do much for suspense and there is little sense of danger despite a scene in which resistance fighters brutally stab a traitor to death. The performances - even by Leung the suave accomplished star of Wong Kar-Wais ""2046"" and ""In the Mood for Love"" - are so flat that you dont really much care what happens to anybody. Though Leung and Wei go full frontal for some extremely acrobatic sadomasochistic sex scenes theyre such ciphers their encounters lack any genuine heat.

His best friend played by Morgan Freeman is a worldly-wise type who also provides the films narration. (Freeman once again sounds like God.)

"Lust Caution | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lust-caution ) Lust Caution (United States/China 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Ang Lees follow-up to Brokeback Mountain is Lust Caution. The films receipt of an NC-17 by the MPAA was dutifully noted by the mainstream media as was the distributors (Focus Features) decision not to appeal the rating. NC-17 movies arenat released often and when they are they rarely make an impression at the box office - some mainstream multiplex chains refuse to show them and some newspapers will not advertise them. This has earned the NC-17 the nickname of the ""kiss of death."" So before discussing the merits of Lust Caution Ill first answer a question at least a few readers are interested in understanding Why the NC-17? What is there about this movie that makes it cross the border from the ever-widening realm of the R? The answer the sex is really hot. Not hardcore pornographic (at least by my definition of the term) but close. Of course for those thinking this might be a fun way to mix art and sex keep in mind that the movie is about 160 minutes long. Of the 160 minutes maybe 10 feature sex and/or nudity. Not a good ratio if thats all youre after. The sex scenes are so intense and explicit (showing pretty much everything except an erect penis and penetration) that someone asked Lee in a recent press conference if the acts are real or simulated. His response ""Have you seen the film?"" Lead actor Tony Leung has been equally cryptic in interviews. The goal appears to be to create an aura of mystery about the sex scenes. One is tempted to say that passion this raw cant be faked but were dealing with good actors. So it remains an open question whether Lust Caution follows in the footsteps of Boxcar Bertha and Wild Orchid. (Two mainstream films in which the participants later admitted to having not simulated the sex.) The bottom line however is that the characters reveal more about themselves during the sex scenes than at any other time in the film. When theyre naked and thrusting and contorting their bodies and faces thats when we see their real interaction. As a result its impossible to argue that the sex scenes are gratuitous. Without them a lot of the films emotional underpinning goes away. Lust Caution features a slow seduction of one character by another and the audience by the director. The buildup is long and lingering - some might argue too long. There are times during the first two hours when the pacing lags. To a large degree thats compensated for by a wrenching final act when morality is upturned and consequences abound. In every way this is an atypical thriller. Itas beautiful to look at (the period detail is superb) and sexy as hell but it sometimes feels like its never going to get to the finish line. Nevertheless I stayed awake and engrossed through the whole thing and couldnt get it out of my head after exiting. Its haunting fascination is hard to deny. Curiously the movie shares some general plot similarities with Paul Verhoevens Black Book. Both are World War II stories that transpire in occupied territories. Both feature female protagonists working for the local resistance. And both women have affairs with highly placed enemy officials then become conflicted as a result of unexpected feelings they develop for those men. There are two significant differences however and those aspects result in the pictures offering divergent experiences. The first relates to location. Black Book unfolds in Nazi territory while Lust Caution splits time between Shanghai and Hong Kong. More importantly the way in which the stories are told are in sharp contrast. Verhoevenas in-your-face action approach is 180 degrees away from Leeas languorous style. The film takes us to the years between 1938 and 1942. Wang (Tang Wei in a stunning courageous debut performance) is a traditional Chinese ""good girl"" who has become a war orphan (her mother is dead her father is ""trapped"" in England). As a result of a crush on a dashing young activist (Wang Lee-Hom) she joins a patriotic theater troupe. The group eventually graduates from putting on politically subversive pageants to taking a more active role in resistance activities including assassinations. Wang is set up to become the mistress of the highly placed collaborator Mr. Yee (a flawless Tony Leung Chiu Wai) as part of a plot to kill him but before the relationship can be consummated Yee is recalled from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Its three years before Wang can follow him and resume her charade. This time things are in earnest. Yee is now the head of the secret service and is a ripe target for elimination. But when Wang becomes his lover complications in the form of unwanted emotional entanglements threaten the operation. Another notable element in Lust Caution is the amount of nonverbal communication that occurs. This is especially evident during the mahjong game that opens the film. The four women around the table hold a banal conversation while their glances and gestures hint that theres another level of interaction transpiring beneath the surface - especially when Mr. Yee enters the room. There are numerous scenes in which more information is conveyed by reading how the characters act and move than by listening to what they say. It has been rightly said that it can be easier to lie with words than with glances. Lust Caution is one of those films that requires patience. Like cold water brought to a boil it takes a long time but once the bubbles start appearing the roiling is impossible to stop. Lee who has never been one to stand pat or rest in a particular genre (this is after all a filmmaker who has been responsible for such diverse fare as Crouching Tiger Hulk and Brokeback Mountain) moves fluidly into new territory and conquers it with an ease that is almost breathless. Aided by the nuanced forceful performances of his two leads he has made Lust Caution something to be seen and savored.

Too much caution and too little lust squeeze much of the dramatic juice out of Ang Lees ""Lust Caution"" a 21/2-hour period drama thats a long haul for relatively few returns. Adapted from a short story by the late Eileen Chang tale of a patriotic student -- whos willing bait in a plot to assassinate a high-up Chinese collaborator in Japanese-held WWII Shanghai -- is an immaculately played but largely bloodless melodrama which takes an hour-and-a-half to even start revving up its motor. A handful of explicit sex scenes (in the final act) have earned pic an NC-17 rating in the U.S. where it goes out in limited release Sept. 28. But beyond the notoriety of a Chinese-language picture with full-frontal female nudity pic lacks the deep-churning emotional currents that drove Lees ""Brokeback Mountain"" and his best other works. B.O. in the West looks to be modest once the initial ballyhoo has died down. Story opens in Japanese-occupied Shanghai in 1942 at the home of Yee (Hong Kongs Tony Leung Chiu-wai) head of the secret service of the collaborationist Chinese government and his wife (Joan Chen). One of Mrs. Yees mahjong partners swapping gossip over the tiles is the much younger Mrs. Mak (Tang Wei) the half-Cantonese half-Shanghainese wife of a businessman who was recently in Hong Kong. As Yee returns from work and passes by the mahjong table its clear theres something between him and Mak though neither one lets their facade slip. Later Mak makes a coded phone call to Kuang Yumin (U.S.-born pop star Wang Leehom) who says ""the operation can start."" After this lengthy 15-minute intro largely occupied by idle chatter around the mahjong table the film flashes back four years to Hong Kong to show who Mak really is Wang Jiazhi a first-year university student whose family fled Hong Kong for the U.K. Through her friend Lai (Chu Tsz-ying) Wang falls in with a patriotic anti-Japanese group that is mounting a play to fund their activities. Leader of the group is the passionate Kuang who hears that Yee a high-ranking collaborator with the Japanese is in Hong Kong on a recruitment mission. Kuang hatches a plan in which Wang plays the fictional Mrs. Mak and insinuates herself into Mrs. Yees confidence. But Mrs. Yees cool wily husband though attracted to Wang slips through the net. Cut to Shanghai 1941 -- a year before the opening timeframe -- and its round two between Yee and Wang. After Wang is rehired by the resistance to continue her Mrs. Mak role this time their liaison is far more full-on and as lust raises its sometimes violent head it looks as if caution may be thrown to the wind by one or both parties. Both Leung and newcomer Tang -- whose characters are far more charismatic and attractive than in Changs original short story -- do strike some sparks especially in the sex scenes which are very bold by Chinese standards. (A tamer version will reportedly be released in mainland China.) But for most of the film the two dance around each other in conversations that dont have much electricity or sense of repressed passion -- and vitally no sense of the real danger that Wang is courting in the game of cat-and-mouse. Moments of either grim wit (as in the messy stabbing of a blackmailing traitor) or spry comedy (Wang getting rid of her virginity to further the cause) occasionally vary pics tone but dont bolster the underlying drama. Wartime Shanghai was far more realistically drawn in Lou Yes Zhang Ziyi starrer ""Purple Butterfly"" which also conveyed a stronger sense of resistance and collaborationist politics. (Here Yees work which involves interrogation and torture is never shown.) Lees 40s Shanghai though immaculately costumed has a standard backlot look; the Hong Kong sequences largely shot in Malaysia are much more flavorsome.
