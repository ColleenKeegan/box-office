Theres fun to be had from observing the array of associated misfits wheeled out to explain how a 25000 porn film grossed 6 million turned the mob into extortionate film distributors and kickstarted a moral outrage that went as high as the Supreme Court. Especially entertaining are the high-trousered director of Deep Throat Gerard Damiano who makes wild claims for his scrappy film; porn star-turned-born-again estate agent Harry Reems; and whiter-than-white prosecutor Larry Parrish who claims to be haunted still by images from the film. The pundits cant be knocked either; Dr Ruth John Waters Camille Paglia Norman Mailer Gore Vidal Hugh Hefner all contribute their informed twopennys worth...But for all its partially interesting conclusions about the sexual revolution and Deep Throats role within it this is a schizophrenic film veering wildly between light detached nostalgia and indignant mock-gravitas. Historians will baulk at the lack of context and some flippant statements (wrapping up a section on Nixons resignation Dennis Hoppers sleazy voiceover declares This national nightmare over the nation got down cueing the briefest of sections on the rest of the 70s). The almost complete dismissal of Lovelaces claims of coercion and bullying on the part of her husband/manager Chuck Traylor are also a little hard to swallow. The directors clearly have Lovelace down as unhinged and untrustworthy. Not that she can defend herself she died in a car crash in 2002.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Inside Deep Throat | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; inside-deep-throat ) Inside Deep Throat (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Inside Deep Throat a documentary from directors Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato is passably interesting occasionally compelling sporadically amusing and badly lacking in focus. Although the film starts out with a clear thesis by the time its 90 minute running length has expired it is grasping at themes and topics that are beyond the limited scope of what a superficial documentary can achieve. Inside Deep Throat comes across as a scattershot look at the war between pornography and morality during the 1970s as seen through the prism of one overhyped X-rated feature. As made-for-TV fare (this was produced by HBO Pictures) theres nothing wrong with Inside Deep Throat. Its perfect for laid-back watching for a viewer not expecting anything thought provoking or deep. But as a theatrical documentary it disappoints. For the 10 admission fee one anticipates something more insightful or engaging than what Bailey and Barbato have to offer. Then again for those viewers who have never seen the original Deep Throat this documentary provides a glimpse of the most 20 notorious seconds from the 1972 porn ""classic."" Inside Deep Throat starts out by explaining the genesis of Deep Throat - where the title came from what it took to get the project off the ground and how Harry Reems ended up with the lead male role. The shadier aspects of director Gerard Damianos financing are explored - the involvement of the mob is discussed in some detail including how Damianos ""partners"" bought him out early in the distribution process. Deep Throat is said to have grossed 600 million but as popular as the film was one has to question how much of that total came from ticket sales and how much was the result of money laundering. When a New York Times article labeled Deep Throat as ""porn chic"" the movie became a phenomenon the first X-rated film to draw from the ""normal"" film-going population. It also became a target of right-wing politicians who wanted to ""clean up"" Times Square. Eventually Deep Throat ended up banned in 23 states. But as most people know theres no better publicity than attempted censorship. The word ""banned"" is synonymous with ""must see."" It didnt matter that Deep Throat was a wretched motion picture with no redeeming non-hardcore cinematic values (even Damiano admits that its crap); it generated so much word-of-mouth and curiosity that it had to be seen. Linda Lovelace the films star eventually became an anti-porn advocate claiming that ""every time you see me having sex in Deep Throat youre watching me being raped."" When she made statements like those she gained TV and magazine exposure but 10 years later she posed naked in a trashy mens magazine. Harry Reems ended up on trial for running afoul of obscenity laws and might have been headed for five years in prison had the Republican administration stayed in office following the 1976 election. Inside Deep Throat chronicles all of this and brings an army of talking heads to the screen including Dick Cavett (who is consistently funny) Ruth Westheimer Alan Dershowitz Hugh Hefner Camille Paglia Erica Jong Larry Flynt Al Goldstein and John Waters. The film tries with limited success to place Deep Throat into a larger social context. It fumbles its way through an exploration of how Deep Throat fit into the overall social upheaval of the 1970s. (Based on this documentary you would think that everything that happened in the morality vs. obscenity wars of the decade had something to do with Deep Throat.) Deep Throats legacy according to the documentarians was the mainstreaming of porn which ultimately led to its mass production and the substitution of a ""factory mentality"" for creativity. Boogie Nights did a better job of depicting the slippery slide of porn once the VCR arrived. Inside Deep Throat has a tendency to become ponderous as it weighs in on its subjects cultural impact and importance. If the filmmakers goal was to convince me that Deep Throat offered a seismic jolt to 1970s society it failed. On the other hand although Inside Deep Throat sometimes turns dry and dull it never takes itself too seriously. There are occasional bursts of humor to liven things up. Deep Throat location manager Lenny Camps profane one-liners are perfectly edited into the fabric of the production as are quips by Dick Cavett. And theres a hilarious interview with Florida distributor Arthur Summerfield thats notable because of the interruptions of his brassy wife Terry. Because it shows a key hardcore clip from Deep Throat Inside Deep Throat earned a deserved NC-17 from the MPAA. Aside from that excerpt there are random instances of nudity and quite a bit of profanity so this movie isnt for prudes. That being said Inside Deep Throat feels much like a traditional documentary with lots of archival footage intermixed with new interviews. The subject matter might seem racy but Bailey and Barbatos presentation is anything but erotic. (One has to wonder whether when this airs on HBO the fellatio scene will be left intact.) Inside Deep Throat was developed with a viewer in mind who didnt live through the 1970s. For those who experienced the decade firsthand the film presents little in the way of true insight although it may be able to satisfy the curiosity of those who have heard of Deep Throat but dont know much about it. Really though Inside Deep Throat is a shallow film that will leave those who yearn for something more substantial feeling a little parched.

But now there are added wonders that refuse to cease. A scene from Inside Deep Throat a documentary that examines the lasting cultural impact generated by the film. AP Inside Deep Throat an NC-17 documentary that deftly chronicles the fallout -- with about 15 seconds of hard-core footage -- has some surprise credits. Its produced by Brian Grazer who has A Beautiful Mind and The Cat in the Hat on his resume. And its directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato who did 2000s The Eyes of Tammy Faye (as in Bakker). As with Tammy Faye the filmmakers have a subject with certain Looney Tunes aspects starting with the fact that Deep Throat filmmaker Gerard Damiano was a family-man/hairdresser who sensed that the line between hard-core porn and bona fide movies was about to shrink. About the movie Inside Deep Throat    1/2 (out of four) Documentary Directors Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato Distributor Universal Pictures Rated NC-17 for explicit sexual content In major markets Friday This trip down memory lane seems to have no agenda and treats principals on both sides of the conflict with respect starting with Damiano star Linda Lovelace (who died broke in 2002) and prosecutor Larry Parrish. The last tried to end pornography by trying to bust Throats male lead Harry Reems now a born-again Utah real estate agent and one of the documentarys most dignified interviewees. Questions such as Lovelaces claim that she was forced to make the film at gunpoint and the films Mob ties are addressed. But on the other side look at the moralists we see heaving stones Richard Nixon before his impeachment; Roy Cohn before his disbarment; and Ohios famed anti-smut crusader Charles Keating pre-Samp;L scam. Weighing in with more recent opining are Norman Mailer Gore Vidal Erica Jong Helen Gurley Brown (a stitch) and Dr. Ruth Westheimer. Filmmaker John Waters notes that Deep Throat didnt incite in-theater masturbation when it caught on with the masses. After all he says you might be sitting next to Angela Lansbury. The movie changed society. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein co-opted its title for their anonymous Watergate source and Bob Hope and Johnny Carson alluded to it in their monologues. The Carson link is especially interesting given sidekick Ed McMahons comment that if libraries could exhibit the hosts nightly monologues students would get a sense of what past decades were about. Something like that happens with this movie. It reminds us There really are socio-archival treasures out there.

"When Porn Became Popular washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On When Porn Became Popular Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 11 2005 ""Inside Deep Throat"" a new documentary by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato performs a task that upon reflection someone was going to get around to doing eventually examining the cultural political and historical legacy of ""Deep Throat"" the X-rated film that more than 30 years after its original release stands as the most profitable movie ever made in America. The contradiction behind that particular factoid -- that an otherwise marginal even transgressive film turned out to be seen by millions of mainstream Americans -- gets to the heart of the fascinating tensions between Puritanism and libertarianism that have animated this country for centuries. And that contradiction propels ""Inside Deep Throat"" along a sprightly course even with its longueurs of yammering talking heads and wearying MTV-style montages. Despite these and a few other flaws ""Inside Deep Throat"" is an often lively investigation of the social forces that produced the original movie and made it an unlikely political shibboleth in the ongoing culture wars. In case readers have forgotten -- or are too young to remember -- ""Deep Throat"" was released on June 12 1972 the breakout movie of a hairdresser-turned-filmmaker named Gerard Damiano. It starred Linda Lovelace (the stage name of Linda Boreman) whose talent for performing oral sex had come to Damianos attention on an earlier production; he immediately stopped filming that movie and wrote a script that would highlight the particular gift of the actress. (""Inside Deep Throat"" by the way is rated NC-17 because it shows the central act of the original movie -- consider yourself warned.) This is all reported by Damiano himself now a wizened septuagenarian with a bad toupee who along with several other principals were tracked down by Bailey and Barbato to capture their reminiscences. We meet a cast of characters that were they not real people could only be featured extras in ""Boogie Nights"" from the shady ""count"" whose mansion Damiano used as a location to his seedy -- but disarmingly candid -- production manager. The filmmakers have done their due diligence in tracking down people who were around during the 1970s and who witnessed ""Deep Throats"" ascension to the pop-culture pantheon. No less than John Waters Erica Jong Dr. Ruth Dick Cavett and Camille Paglia weigh in on why the movies graphic depiction of oral sex was such a watershed. (Its Norman Mailer though who delivers the films most trenchant observations among them that ""Deep Throat"" ""was a giggle. And the worst you can say about Americans is that well sell our souls for a giggle."") There arent many surprises in what often seems an interminable series of commentaries. Where ""Inside Deep Throat"" gets interesting is when the filmmakers chronicle how the political fortunes of Richard Nixon -- whose administration set out to make an example of ""Deep Throat"" in the most ambitious anti-pornography trial in history -- were tied to the film and vice versa. As Harry Reems who was the only person convicted in the trial recalls his lawyer told him at the time that if the GOP won in 1976 hed go to prison; if the Democrats won hed be set free. You know the rest of course and you know the piquant side note that it was a confidential source nicknamed ""Deep Throat"" that brought Nixon down. Rather than dwell on this delicious irony (former Post reporter Carl Bernstein makes only a brief appearance) Bailey and Barbato stay with the movie as it makes its way through American social history -- as Linda Boreman claims that she had been tortured and raped throughout the filming of ""Deep Throat"" as feminists become the unlikely bedfellows of the Reagan administration in their anti-porn activism and as the X-rated film industry gives way to the cheaper (and the filmmakers suggest sleazier) video racket. That last story arc as well as several of the musical numbers on the soundtrack echo the aforementioned ""Boogie Nights"" which shares the romantic view of its protagonists as a guerrilla vanguard against a sexual culture of shame and hypocrisy. If its difficult to accept Damiano and his ilk as heroes and if ""Inside Deep Throat"" makes too-short shrift of Boremans deeply troubling accusations and the larger feminist issues they raised it still makes a diverting case for ""Deep Throat"" as more than just a shadowy cinematic footnote. Inside Deep Throat (90 minutes at Cineplex Odeon Dupont Circle) is rated NC-17 for explicit sexual content.

Directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato. (NC-17. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Inside Deep Throat"" is a documentary about the making of ""Deep Throat"" and about its cultural and political ramifications. Made for 25000 the picture went on to make 600 million though its stars and its director saw none of that money. Along the way it spawned countless wisecracks entered the ""Watergate"" lexicon and became part of the cultural landscape even for people (like me) whove never seen it. The documentary does a fine job of capturing the films historical moment a moment very different from our own. In 1972 Americans were reeling from a decade of unprecedented social change that had taken the country from Doris Day to Linda Lovelace in the blink of an eye. Even among people who were fairly progressive there was a sense of a culture spinning out of control in a disturbing way. Mainstream movies had become more explicit and many believed that Hollywood and the porn industry would eventually join forces -- that pornography was in a sense the advance guard. Hence the legal maneuvering over ""Deep Throat"" had bigger implications with one side trying to make a last stand against smut and the other side wanting to crash the gates. In telling the story the filmmakers interview several dozen people who collectively give testimony to a cultural divide that if anything is as wide today as ever. Whats fascinating is how freakish they all seem. On the right there are prosecutors and anti-pornography activists saying loony things like "" Deep Throat attacks the very core of our being."" Prosecutor Larry Parrish says that images from ""Deep Throat"" are still in his head 30 years later and he cant erase them. What a privileged glimpse into the censorious mind. At the same time the people on the left seem like slobs who either really believe theres nothing morally wrong with having sex on camera for money or who pretend they dont have moral qualms in the hope of making these standards mainstream. Both sides deserve each other. Both sides should live together on an island where they can argue about sex all day because they have that obsession in common. But heaven help us if one side ever wins the argument because 90 percent of us would not like the world that either side would have us live in. ""Inside Deep Throat"" is inevitably the story of Linda Lovelace (nee Linda Bozeman) who was discovered by porn director Gerard Damiano. With the enthusiasm of a Salzburg concertmaster upon encountering the young Mozart Damiano recognized in Lovelaces gag-free oral technique the makings of an American classic. The rest is history. Alas the funding for ""Deep Throat"" reportedly came from underworld sources. Thus no one connected with the film ever made any money. The tragedy of Lovelaces subsequent life is the most arresting part of the ""Deep Throat"" saga. Its also the one aspect most open to differing interpretations. After spouting the doctrines of free love and happy porn she became an ally of feminists and an anti-pornography crusader. Then not long before her death from injuries sustained in a car accident she posed nude for a magazine. She was broke. She was ideologically confused. She lost jobs when her employes found out her identity. She was the victim in a sense of shame. But was this shame intrinsic; that is the inevitable consequence of her behavior? Or was hers simply the story of a fragile woman who could not maintain her self-esteem in the face of the worlds scorn? How you decide that question has a lot to do with how you see the world. I get the feeling Lovelace herself never quite decided. She knew she was a victim. Thats about all she had figured out. If this were 200 years ago Donizetti could do an opera about her. In contrast to Lovelace her ""Deep Throat"" co-star Harry Reems found a way to turn the page by embracing Christianity and becoming a real estate dealer in Utah. He looks sane and healthy and seems to suffer from no ideological confusion. ""Inside Deep Throat"" is balanced enough to serve as a cautionary tale that cuts in several directions at once. Few people upon seeing footage of Times Square in the 1970s would want to return to the squalid crime-infested days of pre-Giuliani New York. At the same time its difficult to look at the repressed faces of these prosecutors and federal agents and feel anything but misery that they and their ilk are in ascendance in todays America. It would be inaccurate to describe ""Inside Deep Throat"" as a plea for moderation but it sure inspires a desire for moderation in its audience. -- Advisory This film contains vivid excerpts from pornographic films.

But the 1972 movies staggering windfall and dubious respectability (suddenly everyone had to see it) became its downfall. Federal prosecutor Larry Parrish a sort of southern-styled Eliot Ness of smut brought Harry Reems to trial. The star of ""Deep Throat"" was the only one targeted and successfully convicted but the decision was overturned. However Reemss acting and personal life deteriorated rapidly. The documentary produced by Brian Grazer (of Ron Howards Imagine Entertainment) and narrated by official bad boy veteran Dennis Hopper gives an instructive account about the movies history as well as the players involved including Reems (now a born-again Christian real estate agent in Utah) his ""Deep Throat"" co-star Linda Lovelace (who died in 2002 from injuries suffered in a car crash) and director Gerard Damiano. There are also interviews past and recent with Reems Lovelace and Damiano as well as such diverse figures as Norman Mailer Larry Flynt Ruth Westheimer Parrish John Waters Gloria Steinem and Susan Brownmiller. _____More in Movies_____  Inside Deep Throat Reviews and Showtimes  Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Oscars Coverage  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now Damiano now frail and gaunt relates some fascinating anecdotes.

The sociocultural earthquake that was ""porno chic"" would have been astounding even if the movie that set it in motion had been utterly routine. Deep Throat however was far from ordinary; it was one of the most idiosyncratic porn films ever made. It had that goony Mickey Mouse theme of a title song not to mention a so-idiotic-its-brilliant gimmick -- a woman with a clitoris in her throat -- that gave the audience something to chortle over. As Norman Mailer observes in Inside Deep Throat a sensational (in every sense) documentary about the porn film that changed the world the effect of Linda Lovelaces outrageous oral acrobatics was to shift the entire cultures erotic spotlight from intercourse to...a different range of activity. Suddenly a porn film wasnt just showing sex. It was expanding what was allowed and inviting the audience to follow. Inside Deep Throat is nimble engrossing and journalistically eye-opening a movie that pulls into focus 30 years of porn in America. It also pulls no punches Since the rating is NC-17 we see all the skin that we need to including several explicit clips of Lovelaces still-startling abilities. The codirectors Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (The Eyes of Tammy Faye) work in their rigorous yet playful informational style and the producer veteran Hollywood player Brian Grazer has ensured that the filmmakers got all the freedom they needed. Inside Deep Throat packs in the entire porno-puritan American circus the lines around the block in the early 70s; the winking wisecracks on late-night TV as Deep Throat entered the national bloodstream; the anxiety that still lingers over the Mobs dominance of the burgeoning triple-X industry of the early 70s; the shutting down of theaters as the nations prosecutors and censors went to work -- helping of course to publicize the very phenomenon they wanted to crush. Just about everyone connected with Deep Throat comes off as a mere witness to something far larger than themselves. Gerard Damiano the former Queens hairdresser who directed the film is now an avuncular Florida geezer in high-waisted pants who barely saw a dime for his efforts. Lovelace who died in 2002 is seen in a variety of clips including her 80s testimonials as an anti-porn crusader and what comes across in every one of them -- including those from Deep Throat -- is her blurry vulnerability her eagerness to do what others told her. Porn docs often play at film festivals and nowhere else but Inside Deep Throat could turn out to be a one-shot porno-chic revival. I suspect many viewers living in a world where virtually nothing happens in pop culture that isnt planned will want to discover (or relive) the story of one of the flukiest revolutions of the 20th century how the seamy sex-film underground turned mainstream. The enforcers who went after Deep Throat come off as the sternest of puritans but as Mailer points out sex is like lava and maybe porn is too. Once it erupts you cant stop the flow.

The ongoing culture wars pitting freedom of expression against upright moral standards provide a relevant kick to ""Inside Deep Throat"" a comprehensive account of the landmark 1972 porn film and its influence that is both raunchy and reflective. Spawned from the unlikely match of mainstream producer Brian Grazer and the edgy ""Party Monster"" team of Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato with heavyweight backing of Universal and HBO spunky docu has a gaudy pop-culture personality that perfectly suits its subject. Unrated as yet but surely destined for an NC-17 in its present form (yes the dirty deed is shown onscreen) pic is due for theatrical release Feb. 11. With left and right both busy with their cultural agendas this film arrives to assert the significance of ""Deep Throat"" in what is celebrated by one side as the long-awaited emergence of a wide-open liberated society and lamented by the other as the dreaded complete breakdown of conventional morality. After all what would Watergate have been without Deep Throat? And wasnt the sort of uncensored media coverage of such events as the Anita Hill/Clarence Thomas hearings and the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky affair made possible by the unprecedented anatomical discussions first foisted upon the public by the phenomenon of this modest movie starring a young lady named Linda Lovelace who possessed one very specific talent? Tracking down everyone possible involved in making the film a raft of intellectual commentators and key participants in the lengthy legal battles the filmmakers successfully place ""Deep Throat"" in the context of its time. It was made under a Nixon administration that despite its power could do little to stem the tide of counterculture forces that prominently included sexual liberation among its facets; tellingly the governments commission on obscenity came up with conclusions that were the opposite of what the administration desired. In a brassy manner that perfectly amplifies the tawdriness of the porno world pic charts the astounding career of the 25000 production that reportedly grossed upward of 600 million making it by far the most profitable movie ever made. Financed by shadowy underworld figures and directed by Gerard Damiano who credits his skill for relaxing women into effectively performing sex scenes to his years of talking with ladies while a hairdresser ""Deep Throat"" was quickly made in Florida under almost ludicrously unprepared circumstances. Damiano claims not to have known of Lovelaces particular oral abilities until filming began and Harry Reems initially brought along as a production assistant was thrust into the male lead out of desperation. Despite the numerous jokes by participants about the meager talents deployed on the picture (which even Damiano admits was bad) it did apply a certain lame sense of humor to the physical hydraulics; with its little plot gimmick of placing the heroines clitoris in her throat it unquestionably hit a nerve. Crucially it also attracted official attention As attorney Alan Dershowitz says ""Deep Throat succeeded in part because the government went after it."" Repeated raids on the New York theater showing the film raised its profile and a subsequent New York Times piece called ""Porno Chic"" suddenly made it respectable for men and women who had never set foot in a dirty-movie theater to see it. The legal wrangling that followed is well documented culminating in a federal trial in which Reems was convicted a decision later overturned on appeal (a particularly compelling clip shows a passionate and articulate Reems on a TV show arguing with none other than Roy Cohn). But as the mob whose ruthless collection methods are soberingly related could barely count its profits and the porno industry boomed a sadness came to underline the lives of those involved in ""Deep Throat."" Damiano was elbowed out financially by partners he will only identify as ""Roman Catholics."" Reems succumbed to drugs and booze (before rehabbing and becoming a Park City Utah realtor); and Lovelace eventually advanced herself as a victim of abuse before she died penniless in a car accident. Expanding pics view of Lovelace are emotional testimonies by her sister and closest high school friend. More implicit but undeniable is the coarsening of the arts and of public discourse across the three-plus decades since ""Deep Throat"" made fellatio a virtual household word. Some may attack the docu for not laying more blame at the films doorstep for whats happened subsequently just as some commentators have attacked recent pic ""Kinsey"" for its sympathetic interest in the man they similarly castigate for his role in loosening societys chastity belt. Despite the fact that Bailey and Barbato previously made the docu ""Monica in Black and White"" it still would have been apt for them to acknowledge the obvious link between the ""Deep Throat"" furor and Clintons Oval Office scandal. Production values are colorfully showy and a vibrant imaginative score by David Steinberg gooses things along. Nudity and graphic language are abundant with hardcore footage limited to a few close-up moments of Lovelace incontrovertibly demonstrating her capacities for the technique she made forever infamous.
