"Me Myself amp; Irene | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; me-myself-irene ) Me Myself amp; Irene (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli After taking a break to become involved in the production of the small coming-of-age drama Outside Providence the Farrelly Brothers are at it again. Their 1998 hit Theres Something About Mary will forever be known for breaking the semen barrier in mainstream movies. It also raised the vulgar comedy to new heights of profitability proving that envelope-pushing will attract more viewers than it will drive away. Since Theres Something About Mary it seems that each new R-rated comedy has tried to exceed the gross-out quotient of its predecessors (American Pie for example was more raunchy and lewd than Mary) leading to a cavalcade of jokes about subjects that Mel Brooks wouldnt have touched in his heyday. However for their latest Me Myself amp; Irene the Farrellys have not joined the one-upsmanship game. Sure this movie contains a fair amount of risquA(c) material and more than a few jokes for people with a warped sense of humor but if anything it is more tame than Theres Something About Mary. Me Myself amp; Irene sacrifices punch lines in order to develop characters and relationships. Me Myself amp; Irene highlights the continuing evolution of Jim Carrey as an actor (as opposed to a comic phenomenon). After submerging his personality in the poorly received Man on the Moon Carrey is back to his usual off-the-wall self. Here he plays a modern version of Jekyll and Hyde courtesy of a split personality disorder. This is Carreys second outing for the Farrellys and his work here is by far the better of the two. Unlike in the previous film (Dumb and Dumber) which was essentially a group of thinly-connected dumb jokes Carreys comic energy is effectively focused. Hes not trying so hard to be funny that he becomes irritating. Working in movies like The Truman Show and Man on the Moon has honed Carreys talent. Carrey is Charlie and Hank two faces of the same man. Charlie is meek kind and ineffectual. Hank on the other hand is aggressive and dumb with an attitude and voice to match Dirty Harry. Charlie is one of the best liked members of the Rhode Island State Police Force but when he loses control of his mind and body and Hank emerges to go on a rampage his career is in jeopardy. His captain (Robert Forster) sends him to deliver a female prisoner Irene (Renee Zellweger) to an upstate New York police station. After that he is supposed to take a little ramp;r. However it turns out that Irene the head groundskeeper at a golf course that was a front for criminal activity may have seen something she shouldnt have and as a result she has been marked for death by some crooked cops (Chris Cooper and Richard Jenkins). So accompanied by an albino serial killer named Whitey (Michael Bowman) Charlie and Irene go on the lam. As with the Farrellys previous directorial outings the plot is the least important aspect of the proceedings. Its there to move things along and provide a clothesline upon which the various comic situations can be hung. Thinking about it or pondering its coherence is not a good approach because it doesnt make a lot of sense. In fact things are so convoluted that a voiceover narrator is needed to keep audiences from becoming lost. And for such a weak plot theres too much of it. The movie runs nearly two hours which is easily 20 to 30 minutes too long. The laugh quotient is down significantly during the final half-hour as the Farrellys make the mistake of concentrating a little too much on the story. (Viewers who leave early will miss a brief post-credits scene designed to reward those who stay in their seats.) This is Carreys second chance to play this kind of split personality (his previous opportunity was in The Mask). From a dramatic standpoint he doesnt offer a masterful performance but he gives us a good sense of both halves of his character and develops Charlie into a likable guy (Hank is another story altogether). Unlike in some of Carreys early movies we get the sense that theres a real person here and since Charlie earns our sympathy were more willing to accept the preposterous plot than we might otherwise be inclined to. As has always been the case physical comedy is Carreys forte and Me Myself amp; Irene offers numerous opportunities to see him in action. Those who appreciated the scene in Liar Liar where he beat himself up will be in stitches during similar sequences in this movie. As Charlies love interest Irene Renee Zellweger is suitably sweet - but not much more. Perhaps its because Carrey dominates every scene hes in but Zellweger too often fades into the background as if shes incapable of holding the cameras intention. She had no problem opposite Tom Cruise in Jerry Maguire - in fact she stole the movie from him - but Carrey is a different matter. Someone with a more demonstrative personality might have done a better job. In the end Irene only matters because shes the means of Charlies salvation not because she has any sort of individual identity. My favorite casting choices are Anthony Anderson Mongo Brownlee and Jerod Mixon who play Charlies three grown sons. (How he came to raise them is a long story that I wont relate here. Rest assured the movie tells all.) Their presence in the film represents an extension of the Right Guard TV commercials where a famous sports figure acts sophisticated. In this case we have three very large black guys who are geniuses. Its a case of having a lot of fun with stereotypes - after all men with these kinds of physiques belong on the football field not going on a full scholarship to Yale or getting a 1430 SAT score on a bad day... It could be argued that the movie tries to gain a little too much mileage out of this single joke but its admittedly a good concept. Those on the lookout for semen wont find any - thats one bodily fluid that doesnt make it to the screen this time. There is however plenty of urine a rather unpleasant shot of chocolate ice cream being dispensed a defecating dog a cow that wont die and an interesting conversation between Charlie and a dildo. There may not be as many jokes in Me Myself amp; Irene as in the Farrellys previous movies but theres no evidence of an improvement in taste on the filmmakers part and some of the laughs are just as big. Its just that a little more effort has gone into building Charlies personality and developing his relationship with Irene. Ultimately Me Myself amp; Irene is a comedy and it works because it does its job of making viewers laugh. It is perhaps a slight notch below Theres Something About Mary on the Farrelly entertainment scale but its a significant improvement over either Dumb and Dumber or Kingpin. The film is less successful as a romance primarily because of the weakness in Irenes character.

Starring Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger. Written and directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly. (Rated R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The good ol Jim Carrey we knew and loved is back rude crude and unglued. Everything but tattooed. You want breast-sucking? ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" has got it. You want penis jokes? You want excrement sight gags? You want race humor? You want to see Jim Carrey flash? Sure you do. ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" has got it. You want a comedy thats off and running with a fresh sense of discovery that builds on its own exhilaration and leaves an audience giddy with glee? Well ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" aint got it. You cant have everything. A Jim Carrey movie is always worth seeing even if it doesnt re-create the guileless shock and scintillation of ""Dumb and Dumber."" A Farrelly brothers movie is always worth seeing too even if it doesnt have a chance of making the next American Film Institute list of 100 best comedies (""Theres Something About Mary"" was No. 21 on the just-released list and deservedly so). ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" is a schizophrenic comedy in more ways than the Farrellys bargained for or seem to understand. It is a comedic fandango on the ""Jekyll and Hyde"" myth where the good and evil personalities of one character are in love with the same woman. It is a comedy of hostility that also wants to be loved. You cant have it both ways. Carrey plays a Rhode Island state trooper with a split personality. One of them a sweet lunk named Charlie is so spineless that he wishes his bride well when she becomes infatuated with another man almost before Charlie has a chance to finish carrying her across the threshold. When other insults pile up and he finally can no longer take it the second personality emerges. It is the rogue cop Hank a small-town Dirty Harry. One of the best things about Carreys performance is the Clint Eastwood imitation he does as Hank whispered malice that comes from the back of the throat and goes for the jugular. Like ""Beauty and the Beast"" the ugly creature is sexier than the nice prince which is where Irene whos caught between them comes in. The object of both Charlie and Hanks affection is Renee Zellweger (""Jerry Maguire"") as Irene a down- to-earth young woman with an interestingly shady background. A big- town girl she has underworld ties that come to the surface when she is detained in poor little Rhode Island -- the Farrellys home turf by the way -- on a traffic violation. San Franciscans love every opportunity to exercise their self-righteous indignation and ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" will hand them another. One running joke that takes racial stereotypes and turns them inside out is so astoundingly off-the-wall that you have to give the bighearted Farrellys the benefit of the doubt. The man Charlies wife (not Irene) runs off with is African American and a dwarf. Thats the joke and its a relief that hes played by the glintingly confident Tony Cox. The couple will abandon their triplet boys leaving them with Charlie who is in denial that theyre obviously not his. After the kids grow into genius-IQ teenagers -- overgrow is more like it -- the running joke is the number of times they can say the word ""mother--."" It was funny the first half-dozen times. Carrey is not the only officer of the law in this film who can play good cop-bad cop without a partner. There are other two-faced cops who seem to be in a much less inspired movie. ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" has the stop-and-go quality of a jalopy as it lurches among good Charlie and bad Hank which can be terrific and the others which definitely is not. So much explanation is required that a folksy offscreen narrator is required. The film ends with the most curious outtakes ever seen still shots of all the Farrelly friends whose bit parts were trimmed even more or eliminated altogether. The list should have been longer. I hope the final shot was not intended as the insult to the audience it seems to be. Carrey does have wonderful opportunities in fits and starts. His transformation in a single take from Charlie to Hank is a glorious parody of Fredric March in 1931s ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."" The inevitable moment later when Charlie must fight Hank however seems only that inevitable. Among his other successful bits is a wildly funny episode of dry mouth brought on by taking the medication that will keep Charlie from turning into the beast. I like gross-out comedy as much as any other pimply-faced masturbator and some of the moments when it occurs here have that old Farrelly hair-gel gloss including a couple of the penis jokes. Carrey himself provides the biggest flash from a major star since Rudolf Nureyev in ""Valentino"" a flash that is for any moviegoer who saw that film before projectionists clipped out that particular frame for their own collections. -- Advisory Gross-out elements and expletives. ..

The laughs roll out by the handfuls in ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" even if they arent quite as convulsive or surprising as the public might be hoping for in this highly anticipated match-up of Jim Carrey and the Farrelly brothers. With Carrey playing the ""dual"" role of a Rhode Island state trooper with a split personality the generations most physical and elastic comic actor has endless opportunities to strut his stuff. Funny as much of the action is however the approach feels rather less fresh and the gross-outs seem more gratuitous than in ""Theres Something About Mary."" But such gradations will mean little at the B.O. with Foxs big summer comedy destined to keep audiences happy and piling into theaters for weeks and weeks. The biggest surprise is that its neither Carrey nor the Farrellys that people will be talking about most after seeing the movie. Walking away with hilarity honors are the three young performers -- Anthony Anderson Mongo Brownlee and Jerod Mixon -- who play Carreys three outsize street-talking Ivy League-destined black sons. Despite their vulgarity these fabulously written characters are by far the sweetest people onscreen. Originally written a decade ago and refreshed after Carrey signed on tale is set on Farrelly home turf of Rhode Island and like ""Mary"" intros its main character in his youth. When he was a tyro motorcycle cop Charlie (Carrey) married his sweetheart who promptly hooked up with a black midget limo driver (a pugnacious Tony Cox) and produced male triplets. This was merely the first of many indignities stoically endured by the sweet-natured Charlie who was then abandoned to raise the three boys in his tiny house by the shore. Once theyre 18 Jamaal Lee Harvey and Shonte Jr. dwarf their dad and their impudent obscene lingo applied to discussions of algebraic equations and other brainy conundrums is as funny as their loving obedient manner with their father is endearing (they readily consent to his cheerful admonition upon leaving for work ""No bitches in the room after 11""). The setup is designed to paint Charlie as the ultimate pushover; even a little girl jumping rope on the street tells him to get lost when he has the temerity to suggest that she move to the safety of the sidewalk. So his transformation after 25 minutes into a psychopathically vengeful cop named Hank -- his ""other"" heretofore pent-up self -- carries with it the initial satisfaction of a corrective settling of scores after enduring decades of wimpdom. Carrey handles the changeover with some of his patented plastic-skinned face-making plus the addition of an exaggerated Dirty Harry vocal sneer (Carrey appeared in the final Dirty Harry entry ""The Dead Pool""). But Hank disappears as suddenly as he materialized and Charlie is soon diagnosed with a case of ""advanced delusionary schizophrenia with involuntary narcissistic rage"" and is assigned the routine task of escorting a young lady named Irene (Renee Zellweger) back to upstate New York where investigators are waiting to question her in regard to a local fraud and embezzlement case involving her ex-boyfriend and boss. Thus begins the odyssey of Charlie Hank and Irene which is quickly transformed from an innocuous road trip into an adventure on the lam when crooked New York cops and Charlies concerned Rhode Island colleagues accompanied by his three sons separately start pursuing the couple. Charlie of course is nice and respectful of Irene but Hank spoils everything with his vile and violent behavior; he picks fights especially with kids and makes fun of a meek albino waiter (Michael Bowman) in a health food restaurant before apologizing and inviting him along. Soon the gap between Charlie and Hank closes to the point where they are almost constantly vying for supremacy. Things get weird and kinky in a motel room and gags involving a dildo Charlies sore rear end a bathroom wall and a chicken shoved where the sun dont shine are best experienced not explained. Inevitably Charlie and Hank must have a showdown and this epic tussle in which Carrey fights with himself is meant to be the stars big comic set piece. While amusing enough its not very effectively staged (at the Providence train station) goes on too long and doesnt measure up to the great bathroom sequence in ""Liar Liar"" in which Carrey tried to beat himself to a pulp. Fortunately theres more to come including a rude surprise for Charlie when he manfully tries to rescue Irene from her ex on a bridge and the three sons theft of a helicopter. After his impressive turns in two loftier seriously themed pictures ""The Truman Show"" and ""Man on the Moon"" Carrey is back in time-tested manic form for which mainstream audiences will surely be grateful. Alternating his meek and menacing characters with glee Carrey whos decked out with a military-style crewcut exults in blowing his performances up to a sort of epic comic-book stature and he gets to do it twice here. Unfortunately Zellweger doesnt match up as a perfect foil. Although Irene is merely a victim of her own gullibility the character somehow prompts the hitherto delightful actress to reveal a certain harsh and unpleasant side that becomes rather too dominant. Nor is her timing nearly as precise as Carreys so shes not always in synch with his quicksilver transformations and rapid-fire utterances. But fortunately theres always Anderson Brownlee and Mixon to take up the slack; their every scene is a raucous delight and their act never gets old. Bowman also lends a unique presence as Whitey the albino waiter who goes through more personality phases than does Charlie. Though not the case in ""Mary"" here the Farrellys allow the action to sag from time to time while their comic aim is not as sure-fire. The really outrageous sexual humor is present to be sure but it has a certain dragged-in quality as if the brothers had a gross-out quota to fill and inserted the penile/rectal/vaginal gags so to speak wherever they could. The musical elements are not as imaginative or organic as they were in their previous outing while the visual quality is similarly mangy. Viewers should stick around through the end credits so as not to miss a scene after the boilerplate disclaimer and copyright material.

So its just another sunshiny day...2000-06-30Chris Cooper20th Century Fox Film Corporation B- Me Myself amp; Irene Genre Comedy Romance; Starring Jim Carrey Renee Zellweger Chris Cooper; Director Bobby Farrelly; Author Bobby Farrelly; Producer (person) Bobby Farrelly; Producer (group) Conundrum Entertainment 20th Century Fox Film Corporation; Release Date Wide 06/23/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 116; MPAA Rating R; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted June 30 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT A Jim Carrey character traditionally wakes up in the morning nursing a coruscating rage masked by antic adaptability. So its just another sunshiny day for the actor in Me Myself amp; Irene. Carrey plays Charlie Baileygates a Rhode Island state trooper so pathologically mild-mannered that even when his wife gives birth to black triplets then leaves him for the boys father a Mensa-card-carrying African-American dwarf limo driver Charlie never complains never explains just loves his sons. But two-facedness being his specialty Carrey also plays Hank the pathologically aggressive dirty-minded id to Charlies superego who after years of incubation hatches with all the drama of an Alien birth. And both personalities fall for Irene (Renee Zellweger) a plucky woman unfairly implicated in a business fraud devised by her skunky fiance. So on a long road trip from Rhode Island to upstate New York -- theres a warrant out for Irenes arrest and Officer Baileygates is her escort -- both Charlie and Hank vie for the girl. Me Myself amp; Irene is a romance; famously the stars fell in love too after working together. (Certainly Carrey looks smitten whenever he gazes at Zellweger amiable in a sketchy reactive role.) But the movie is also first and foremost a comedy by the Farrelly brothers Peter and Bobby. And famously the creators of Theres Something About Mary and the 1994 Carrey starrer Dumb and Dumber never settle for one reference to dogs pooping and men farting if two or three will do; when the brothers mojo is in high gear every instance of gleeful bad taste is timed and positioned for maximum liberating laugh value. So why is the mojo now stuck in second gear? Me Myself amp; Irene shifts unsteadily between slow-moving gauzy-focus romance and ""transgressive"" gross-out comedy as lurchingly as Charlie and Hank battle for airtime. The classic touches that distinguish the Farrellys from such auteurs as Steven Soderbergh and Abbas Kiarostami -- Im thinking in no particular order of the introduction of a dildo a chicken shoved up a gentlemans behind and a gun-waving albino waiter -- arent paced with nearly the slapdash finesse of Mary. Even punchline scenes run long as if the filmmakers found it particularly hard to part with footage. Anthony Anderson Mongo Brownlee and Jerod Mixon do a great jiggle and bop as Charlies three sons. But the talents of other piquant supporting actors particularly Chris Cooper and Robert Forster are lost in the random hubbub. As for Carrey well nobody does Jekyll/Hyde better than the star of The Mask Liar Liar and Man on the Moon. Go figure It turns out that smiley unchaotic love both on screen and off is not nearly so inspiring to Peter and Bobby Farrelly as the opportunity to frolic with poop in their hearts.

(20th Century Fox) I just dont see the animal rights crowd yukking it up at ""Me Myself and Irene."" Not after what the latest Farrelly brothers movie does with chickens. Lets just say they try to outdo the spirit of John Waterss ""Pink Flamingos."" And then theres the scene in which ""Irene"" star Jim Carrey fires gunshots repeatedly into the head of an ailing cow. When the bullets fail to put the beast out of its misery Carrey straddles the prone beast squeezes its windpipe and jams his fingers into both nostrils. But then again the cow is obviously artificial. And the filmmakers (Peter and Bobby Farrelly) are known for shock-value comedy; they brought us ""Dumb amp; Dumber"" and ""Theres Something About Mary."" And you remember what happened to the dog in ""Mary."" For the Farrellys animals - or their artificial representation - are fair game. So to be expected ""Me Myself amp; Irene"" the uh touching story of a sweet-natured Rhode Island cop (Carrey) who learns he has some serious suppressed-rage issues is full of cheap shots sight gags over-the-top slapstick and gross-out humor. But this time it doesnt feel quite the same. Carrey plays mild-mannered state trooper Charlie who never sticks up for himself. Even children insult him. Hes so passive he doesnt even raise a fuss when his wife gives birth to three babies - who are obviously the children of an African American lover. In fact he raises them with all the dedication of a true dad even though they spit out relentless obscenity. It just so happens theyre rocket scientists in the making too debating the finer points of quantum physics in that R-rated language. Charlies hidden anger finally explodes. It seems theres an angrier confrontational version of himself just dying to get out a mean customer named Hank who acts like Dirty Harry on the nastiest day of his life. Charlie gets prescription pills for his schizophrenia but he has to remember to take them every six hours. When Charlies ordered to escort Irene (Zellweger) back to her home town to face a bogus hit-and-run charge (explaining her storys too complicated to bother with) he forgets his medication. Obviously its a matter of time before Charlie and Irene find themselves at the mercy of . . . Hank. Also on their trail a bad fed (Chris Cooper) whose murky agenda is - like Irenes story - too convoluted to explain. Squinting at this movie through my pince-nez spectacles Id have to give ""Irene"" a modest B grade. This time the Farrelly trademark - sheer grossness and proud of it - seems to have run its coarse. I found myself laughing several times but I was also disappointed. Even the most outrageous gags have lost their luster because theyre such familiar Farrelly fare. The uh oeuvre has become all too clear. As for the romantic subplot between Charlie and Irene it echoes too closely the moron-escorts-beauty story line in ""Dumb amp; Dumber."" Carrey may have played himself a few too many times. His Dirty Harry persona well Ive seen that before. And the climactic scenes in which Charlie and Hank battle for soul-and-body rights seems too reminiscent of ""Liar Liar"" and Steve Martins ""All of Me"" to induce more than modest laughter. Theres Something About Zellweger too. Perhaps shes got too much class for a movie like this. You cant have a real actor breaking loose on the set ruining cheap gags with professional poise James L. Brooks white courtesy phone. Now dont let me stop you from thinking this film has its share of laughs - most of them too crude to repeat. And this may be the first comedy to need a human pooper scooper. But like Charlie you might find yourself being of two minds about the whole thing.
