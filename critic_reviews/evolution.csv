It may not be ""Ghostbusters"" but Ivan Reitmans return to the arena of otherworldly crime fighting is a consistently amusing action romp that easily passes muster as a summertime diversion. Smoothly injecting a welcome strain of knowing humor into the overworked invading aliens sci-fi/horror genre ""Evolution"" also benefits from the agreeably supple interplay of its leading players a modesty in the scale of production and some exceedingly vivid and credible visual effects that blend seamlessly with the action. While not looking to be a record buster this DreamWorks release should surmount a questionable print campaign and benefit from upbeat word-of-mouth to evolve into a fine long-range moneymaker in all markets. Originally written as a dramatic piece by Don Jakoby script was wisely taken in a comic direction by Reitman and subsequent scenarists David Diamond and David Weissman (""The Family Man""). The picture has the requisite quotient of crude anatomical humor some of it quite funny in fact but the prevailing tone is one of underplayed absurdism an approach nicely achieved and maintained by practiced hands who know exactly what theyre doing. During the ""Meatballs"" era one would never have thought that Ivan Reitman would ever be accused of sophistication but in the current comedy climate its just about come to that. If ""Evolution"" had been done straight the opening would have been a real groaner so many times now have we witnessed the sight of a flaming meteor hurtling toward Earth. This one lands in the desert amid the spectacular buttes and rock formations around Arizonas Lake Powell and practically on top of Wayne (Seann William Scott) a young doofus and aspiring firefighter whos practically incinerated while practicing his life-saving skills on a full-sized blow-up doll. First to check out the site and become aware that something is awry are Dr. Ira Kane (David Duchovny) a former government scientist now laying low teaching biology at a community college and Harry Block (Orlando Jones) Iras geology instructor colleague whose more avid campus pursuit is coaching the womens volleyball team. Discovering that the meteor is ""a rock that bleeds"" Ira takes some samples back to his lab where he observes that the single-cell organisms carried in from outer space are splitting and quickly growing into complex multicell creatures such as flatworms. The astounded scientist realizes that hes just witnessed two billion years of evolution in a single day. But just because Ira can project what the terrifying logical end result of this process might be doesnt mean he can do much to stop it. When the U.S. Army takes control of the crash site Ira and Harry are declared persona non grata by presiding Gen. Woodman (Ted Levine) and disease control official Allison (Julianne Moore) who reveals Iras unfortunate military record as the creator of a failed anthrax vaccine. Unable to restrain themselves however the unauthorized locals soon sneak into the sealed-off site which has now become a veritable indoor rain forest complete with a host of weird creatures one of which literally gets under Harrys skin. Fans -- teens and otherwise -- of below-the-belt humor will find comic nirvana in the resulting episode in which doctors deduce that the alien insect can only be removed through back door entry to the painful consternation of the squirming Harry. From here the stakes are raised considerably as a dragon rises from a golf course water trap for a human snack and a field full of dead and dying dinosaur-like reptiles is found right in town. But while the first batch of alien monsters appears to expire when exposed to pure oxygen the next generation has no such limitation as seen when a ravenous beast flies into a shopping mall (not without a comic mishap or two) and snatches a teenage girl aloft only to be shot down by Ira. Although the emphasis is on humor Phil Tippett (""Jurassic Park"" ""Starship Troopers"") was in charge of the visual effects -- pretty much guaranteeing some scare value as well. The creatures here are varied detailed and fearsome and while what they do isnt gory or shocking its often startling enough to produce screams winces or covered eyes depending upon viewer tolerance. The effects blend with notable naturalness into the physical texture of the film proper an asset furthered by the sly low-key way in which the players interact with ""characters"" you know werent there during the actual shooting. The action accelerates rapidly from mid-point on as the team of Ira Harry new recruit Wayne and eventually Allison fight both the military and the monsters to avert what promises to be a complete alien takeover of the U.S. within two months time. Many of the standard disaster film situations are present -- the panic of local officials the evacuation of a small town the misguidedly confident bluster of military officials the stealthy efforts of marginal misfits to save the day -- but all skewed to breezy comic effect. Semi-gross-out ending in which the mother of all aliens is combated with Head and Shoulders shampoo messily but adroitly sends up the heroics associated with the entire genre particularly ""Independence Day."" Strong chemistry among the leads enhances the unusually easy-going and enjoyable mood. Alertly working in a vein of wry understated wit Duchovny has found here a much-needed commercial vehicle to jump-start his bigscreen career but also one which with its extraterrestrials and mysterious quasi-scientific overtones possesses amusing echoes of ""The X-Files."" Jones proves to be an offbeat impudent comic foil; with his lanky frame glasses and often quizzical look hes something of a black Jeff Goldblum. But the bond established by these two thesps isnt so exclusive that it cant expand to include the more antic Scott (""American Pie"" ""Road Trip"") once he asserts himself or even Moore who plays a brainy klutz who falls for Ira. Production values are tops but appealingly unassuming with Michael Chapmans lensing making good use of the bright Arizona light editing by Sheldon Kahn and Wendy Greene Bricmont nudging things along at a spry clip and John Powells score further enlivening the proceedings.

Theyve stumbled across the most exciting scientific discovery of the new millennium alien plankton. Thats only the beginning. These suckers evolve 800 million years in a few hours; by mid-week theyre growing legs lungs and appetites. By Sunday the professors realise their tenure is at stake along with the rest of mankinds. On the face of it the film is a sloppy catch-all conflation of Independence Day and Ghostbusters. Fun though. Director Reitman obviously doesnt hold with the stereotype of the earnest dry dedicated scientist his heroes are cynical immoral and only fractionally smarter than the petty bureaucrats and pompous military officers with whom they must contend. It would be stretching a point to call this satire - Reitmans comedy is pitched squarely to the libertarian right. Its anti-establishment anti-Other and mind-bogglingly obsessed with anal sex. Whatever possessed Moore to demean herself as a sexy klutz government scientist who falls flat on her face repeatedly and Scott is also highly resistible in a part shoe-horned in for teen audiences; at least Duchovny is agreeably mild-mannered allowing Jones to milk the black-sidekick role for many more laughs than its worth. But of course the real eye candy comes in the CGI work.

Photo HANDOUT Survival of the dumbest / Sci-fi comedy Evolution wastes the good efforts of Duchovny Moore 1 / 2 Back to Gallery EVOLUTION Comedy. Starring David Duchovny Julianne Moore Orlando Jones and Seann William Scott. Directed by Ivan Reitman. (PG-13. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Evolution"" a comedy about alien life forms that threaten Earth David Duchovny gives a performance thats classy witty and far better than this movie deserves. The defected star of ""The X-Files"" Duchovny acts as if he didnt know this material stinks -- which of course he does. In a movie as hackneyed and as dull as ""Evolution"" the small favors of Duchovnys performance stand out. Playing a disgraced former government scientist who discovers alien organisms on a fallen meteor -- and tries to parlay the find into a career comeback -- Duchovny has a dry easy charm. He hits nice comic grooves with Orlando Jones (""The Replacements"") works well with Julianne Moore and retains his dignity despite a mediocre script that requires him to administer enemas to a giant mutating extraterrestrial. ""Evolution"" was directed by Ivan Reitman who borrows from his 1984 comedy ""Ghostbusters"" as well as pilfering ideas and images from ""Alien"" ""Jurassic Park"" ""The Nutty Professor"" ""Independence Day"" and even ""The Wizard of Oz."" Like ""Moulin Rouge"" this is another example of cinema eating itself. Unlike ""Moulin Rouge"" which has energy and visual imagination ""Evolution"" is flat rickety and enervated. Related Stories In Evolution its survival of dumbest / Duchovnys efforts better than script Reitman sets the tale in Arizona where a meteor crashes in the desert. Duchovny working as a community college professor takes samples from the meteor and then watches through his microscope as the organisms mutate and reproduce at an alarming rate -- 200 million years worth of evolution in two hours. Jones a cocky geology professor at the same school wants equal credit for the discovery. At first the life forms resemble worms then insects and amphibians then birds and mammals and dinosaurs (Berkeleys Tippett Studio which worked on ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Starship Troopers"" created the creatures). The Pentagon takes control Moore shows up playing a klutzy epidemiologist from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an Army general (Ted Levine) boots Duchovny and Jones from the meteor crash site. Seann William Scott (""Dude Wheres My Car?"") rounds out the cast as a dimwitted firefighter wannabe joining Duchovny Jones and Moore in an effort to save the world. Smell like Dorothy the Scarecrow the Tin Man and Cowardly Lion? Youre getting warm. Dan Aykroyd one of Reitmans ""Ghostbusters"" team plays the bellicose governor of Arizona. Jones works very hard to redeem this material but there isnt much a man can do with lines like ""Dont anger me unless you want a Solid Gold dancer on your hands."" In his showiest scene he grimaces screams and bugs his eyes while a surgeon enters through his backside to remove an alien dragonfly. Is this why he became an actor? I can understand what Duchovny Jones and the underemployed Aykroyd are doing in boneheaded effects-laden fluff like this but I cant explain Moore. A gifted enterprising actress shes been trying for years to balance risky independent fare (""Safe"" ""Short Cuts"" and ""Boogie Nights"") with high-profile studio releases (""Assassins"" ""Nine Months"" ""Hannibal""). Her indie efforts are interesting and often brilliant but her commercial choices are nearly always disastrous. Maybe its just bad luck -- a lot can happen between the script and the final cut -- but somehow one imagines Moores response when an offer arrives for a big-budget movie ""Oh sure"" she says breezily. ""Just send me the plane ticket for now. Ill read the script on the way to the set. . . ."" Advisory This movie contains raunchy humor and sexual references.

You should not murder.And you should not see ""Evolution.""There are so many degrees of bad when it comes to movies it would take some kind of divining rod to differentiate the subtle differences. In the absence of such an instrument let me put it simply ""Evolution"" is bad. How bad? Who cares? Do you ask how hot the fire is before running out of a burning building? No you just run for safety.So ruuuuuuunDirector Ivan Reitman made ""ghostbusting a household name"" as DreamWorks gushes in its press kit for the movie. But here he stands to give ""Evolution"" such a bad connotation he should get monthly checks from the fundamentalists.So this meteor streaks toward Earth carrying alien cootie organisms. It lands inside a cave in Arizona. And this meteorite starts spawning gross little cells that divide and multiply into disgusting worms before evolving into scary reptilian creatures. They proliferate like crazy constantly changing to adapt to Earths atmosphere.As they speed through this evolutionary proscess four badly drawn characters try to stop them. Theres jaded scientist and community college professor Dr. Ira Kane (David Duchovny whose movie-acting career is devolving before his eyes). And theres also Iras woman-chasing college associate Harry Block (Orlando Jones); Wayne (Seann William Scott) an aspiring none-too-smart fireman; and Allison (Julianne Moore) an epidemiologist from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The less said about this plot including a listless romance between Duchovny and Moore the better. As if aware of the humourous shortcomings Reitman sends in the special effects cavalry. The monsters in ""Evolution"" (created by the same folks who gave us ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Starship Troopers"") are so jarringly effective they destroy the comedic texture of the film - which hardly exists in the first place.Speaking of which you never met such a comicaly uninspired foursome. Take Moores character. Please. She bumps into glass doors falls down stairs and topples over constantly. This routine is apparently so hilarious to Reitman he makes her slip and trip throughout the movie. You dont laugh so much as feel her pain.In next to no time youll find yourself rooting for the icky aliens.As Wayne Seann William Scott the funny co-star of ""American Pie"" and ""Road Trip"" does have his moments. Best moment in the movie when Wayne attempts to lure a winged alien with bad jungle bird calls (as in caw Ca-caaaw). Too bad this scene couldnt be extracted and used in an actual comedy. But for now it must serve as a regretful footnote.""Evolution"" (PG-13 105 long minutes) - Contains obscenity sexual situations and no humor.

It develops into a kind of underground incubator for alien creatures with predatory dispositions. Not just any aliens; ones that replicate and evolve faster than the Osmond family. Who ya gonna call to stomp out these ever-changing beasties from beyond? Why naturally two community-college science profs (ever-underwhelming X-Filer David Duchovny and sidekick-of-the-moment Orlando Jones) and a pool boy (Seann William Scott of American Pie) who clearly has sniffed a few too many chlorine fumes. Oh and director Ivan Reitman who reconfigures his Ghostbusters framework into a fitfully funny sci-fi comedy. Read more Stories Evolution aims to scare with flair Video Evolution trailer If only Evolution replicated its cinematic references from the obvious (Men in Black Jurassic Park) to the obscure (Tremors) with the same haste as its aliens. The sluggish and humor-impaired first half given over to how Duchovny is an ex-government scientist who left his job in disgrace and how Scott yearns to be a fireman should be called Exposition. Instead of scoring belly laughs theres a run on randy guy banter between Duchovny and Jones who for some reason also coaches a womens volleyball team (the better to crack lame locker-room jokes). The pair happen upon the meteor site collect some goo samples realize they have found aliens who multiply so fast they dont even have time for sex and see fame and fortune in their futures. Standing in the way is the genres typical bogeyman the military led by a belligerent general (Ted Levine of The Silence of the Lambs) who despises Duchovny. Hanging around is Julianne Moores strait-laced epidemiologist (an epidemic specialist to you) whose purpose is to fall a lot and fall for Duchovny. Eventually the ebony-and-ivory duo (Jones is a combo of fourth Ghostbuster Ernie Hudson and Will Smith) connect with Scott whose dude-savant act actually offers welcome comic relief in these dry circumstances. Once the aliens in their various guises (beefy hummingbirds blue gorillas bulbous reptiles) start commingling with the nearby townfolk Evolution finally takes off. Especially when a winged gargoyle-raptor hybrid swoops into a mall and picks up a little something -- namely a ditzy shoplifter. Talent-on-the-verge Jones is at his best after a pestlike critter gets under his skin and doctors must extract it from his backside. ""Theres always time for lubricant"" he cries as they rush right in. That leads to Evolutions most noteworthy accomplishment more butt gags both visual and verbal than you can shake a rump at. One can only guess if the unnamed planet thats home to the aliens is Uranus.

Review Evolution amusing not very involving By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Youll be hard-pressed to find a review of ""Evolution"" -- an intentionally silly special effects comedy starring David Duchovny and Julianne Moore -- that doesnt refer to ""Ghostbusters"" (1984) or ""Men in Black"" (1997). All three pictures operate on glib banter and their monster-battling protagonists seem fully aware that theyre participating in a dumb summer movie They sound like theyre channeling Groucho Marx even when their lives are in peril. Though ""Evolution""s rather pokey pace is a welcome reprieve from screaming 100-mile-a-minute onslaughts like ""The Mummy Returns"" its not a complete success. Character development is virtually non-existent and director Ivan Reitman -- who also helmed ""Ghostbusters"" -- comes close to boring you with his never-varying sense of comic timing. He consistently waits two beats after a shocking event then has someone drop a rib-nudging quip into the mix. The movie though likable seems directed by a metronome.

Posted June 15 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT Posters promoting Evolution feature the familiar yellow smiley face of the 1970s altered by the addition of a third eye and jocular tag lines alluding to an amusing apocalypse ""Have a nice end of the world"" and ""Coming to wipe that silly grin off your planet."" The ironic retro bite of the ad campaign is sassy - smileys are so out that theyre in again at least among those who didnt own the decals the first time around - but the ad campaign has relatively little in common with the tone of this shaggy smiley comedy about a couple of low-level academics who stumble upon a virulently adaptive (and hostile) alien life-form that having hitched a ride on a meteor and crash-landed on Earth threatens to take over the world beginning with Glen Canyon Ariz. Theres more than a blob of broad Ghostbusters-style inventive mayhem to this soft-laugh (as opposed to laugh-out-loud) fantasy which makes sense since Ivan Reitman directed. And Ill go with the effusiveness of his enthusiasm over the tricked-up emptiness of a music-video guys feature caper every time. Actually in the evolution of Reitmans resilient directing career - from the peaks of Meatballs Ghostbusters and Dave to the valleys of Fathers Day and Six Days Seven Nights - Id label this one a platypus a comedy dead end from a Darwinian point of view but plenty entertaining nonetheless with its flapping waddling genetic references to E.T. Planet of the Apes and Ghostbusters itself. Then again theres also a sharp strain of jokily mutant X-Files paranormality to the proceedings which suits X-Files alumnus and Evolution star David Duchovny well in his most effective and appealing demolition of Mulderhood since he flirted with Garry Shandling on The Larry Sanders Show. (Thats not counting the thespians deadpan narration of the soft-core bedroom-eyes Showtime series Red Shoe Diaries.) Duchovny it turns out is strongest when hes playing off an already established persona whether its Fox Mulder or his own brainiac-frustrated-by- TV-fame reputation. Here he plays Dr. Ira Kane as a sort of there-but-for-the-grace-of-Scully loser a variation on the famously dour Mulder DNA. Busted down to community-college teacher for messing up as a government scientist Kane joins his happy-go-lucky colleague Harry Block (Orlando Jones) to investigate the new meteor site in town only mildly interested until microscopic analysis reveals a profusion of one-celled organisms that quickly evolve to flatworms to swimming and flying things to fantastical prehistoric creatures and even in one leap of big-bang triumph to a menacing hominid. Friendly cooperation is not on the agenda. (Some creatures indeed sport that fanged head-within-a-head physiology made popular by the genuine accept-no-substitutes Alien.) Neither is it on the agenda of the officious Army types who quickly move in to manage the site naturally making things worse in the way authorities do in Reitman comedies. As an epidemiologist who means to be all buttoned-up business but whose klutziness exposes the nifty sexy gal underneath every time she trips or walks into a door Julianne Moore throws herself into pratfalls with endearing gusto the dumb-and-dumber predictability of her gawkiness offset by the novelty of the shtick a kind of dented Clarice Starling. As a local would-be fireman who joins the alienbusting amigos Seann William Scott of the geek-freak comedy Dude Wheres My Car? plays...another dim-ish young man. Evolution has got too many bugs in its system The script written by The Family Mans David Diamond and David Weissman and Vampires Don Jakoby from Jakobys original story is weirdly uneven and with Reitmans tendency toward loose pacing slack punchlines twist all too slowly in the wind. (This really takes its toll on the Dumb Old Army sequences.) On the other hand the movie is visually witty and even marvelous when it comes to depicting the spectacular creatures evolving at a speed previously known only in the Bible. Going forth and multiplying under the direction of visual effects supervisor Phil Tippett who previously helped give birth to dinosaurs in Jurassic Park and giant insects in Starship Troopers the aliens in Evolution are generations more advanced and interesting than the rudimentary goo that was the building block of Ghostbusters and Reitmans integration of human and special effects has also progressed since Dan Aykroyd teamed with Bill Murray and Harold Ramis 17 years ago as ""paranormal investigators."" You remember Aykroyd dont you? Large guy plays the one man in America who sees the Japanese attack coming in Pearl Harbor? In Evolution he plays the governor of Arizona an elected official just this side of refreshingly nuts that side of blithely sane. The gov is an Aykroydal living organism at its most effective and happily Ivan Reitman knows better than to fool with Mother Nature.
