At the movies The Master of Disguise 080202 - The Augusta Chronicle Augusta Chronicle   | CC News Times   | Augusta.com   | Augusta Real Estate   | Augusta Autos   | Augusta Jobs   | Apartment Finder Site Web At the movies The Master of Disguise By Christy Lemire| Associated Press Friday August 02 2002 Such a sad irony that Dana Carvey whos made his name bringing celebrities to life with uncanny impersonations should make such a lifeless movie based on characters of his own creation. None is funny or inspired. The jokes are beaten to death. And the dialogue (which Carvey wrote) consists of his character the nerdy Pistachio Disguisey repeating everything everyone else says. The plot about a villain who kidnaps Pistachios parents in order to steal the worlds treasures is an excuse for Carvey to become about a dozen other people all of them obnoxious. Jennifer Esposito Harold Gould and James Brolin (who doesnt need the work this badly) co-star. PG for mild language and some crude humor. 80 min. One star out of four.

Comments The Master of Disguise Imagine combining bad imitations of the Ace Ventura and Austin Powers movies and youll have a rough idea of this feeble Dana Carvey farce about an Italian-American named Pistachio Disguisey who like his father and grandfather is supposedly a master impersonator. The movie has to enlist Bo Derek and Jesse Ventura to achieve ""imitations"" of them and George W. Bush in the flesh would have been much funnier than this movies impersonation. The only time I chuckled was when Carvey tried to approximate a giant turtle. Percy Andelin Blake directed; with Jennifer Esposito Mark Devine and Harold Gould (2002). 80 min.

With Dana Carvey James Brolin Jennifer Esposito. Directed by Perry Andelin Blake. Running time 80 mins. Rated PG Mild language crude humor. 1 star I sat down for the critics screening of the new Dana Carvey comedy ""The Master of Disguise"" with a burning curiosity Could the movie possibly be as bad as its trailer suggests? As promotional tools trailers for bad movies are duty-bound to steal their films best jokes and the trailer for ""Master"" doesnt have a laugh in it. It could have been made by a rival studio or by someone whose dog Carvey might have run over. But after seeing the movie my heart goes out to the trailer-makers. They did their best under dire circumstances. The film contains no good jokes no good scenes barely a moment when Carveys ""Saturday Night Live""-honed mimicry rises above the level of embarrassment. The comedian was his own gremlin. ""Master"" co-written by Carvey and Harris Goldberg (""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo"") and directed by Perry Andelin Blake is an 80-minute comedy sketch in which Carvey - playing the latest in a line of genetically endowed disguise artists - puts on more than a dozen costumes and voices. The assumption of the project is that Carvey doing voices is funny regardless of what hes saying or doing. This seems to work for his interviewers. I saw him on a morning talk show recently cracking up his interviewer every time he changed his voice. A feature film however needs context to go with its stars talent. The script creates a narrative thread Carveys character Pistachio Disguisey is trying to rescue his kidnapped parents from a flatulent black-market art collector (Brent Spiner). But the individual scenes are just random uninspired riffs by Carvey or awkwardly flat cameos by the likes of Jesse Ventura and Olympic sprinter Michael Johnson. In one routine Carvey dresses in a turtle suit to enter the all-male Turtle Club and walks around chirping ""Turtle turtle."" In another he crashes a party dressed as Al Pacino in ""Scarface"" and though his impression is good it has no relevance to anything and worse isnt funny. The actors playing Pistachios various friends relatives and enemies are stuck playing straight men to a clown. Among them are James Brolin as Pistachios father and Harold Gould as his grandfather and tutor. Jennifer Esposito as his assistant is required merely to look pretty and does that well. Some inside baseball Columbia laced the crowd at the critics screening with target-audience kids one of whom gave me my only laugh. The third time the villain noisily passed gas the child said ""Mama what is that?"" Might as well break it to him Mom. Its the shoddiest cheapest most infantile joke in movies - and hell hear it a lot.

""Why dont you do one of your funny voices to cheer the kid up?"" he is asked. Unfortunately Carveys talent for doing funny voices is the entire premise behind this excruciatingly unfunny movie. Lacking even a hint of humor or a watchable story Disguise has distinguished itself as the summers worst movie. Related items Master of Disguise (out of four) Rating PG for mild language and some crude humor Carvey plays a pathetic loser by the name of Pistachio Disguisey one of the sorriest monikers in comedy history. After his parents are kidnapped Pistachio learns that he hails from a long line of masters of disguise. To rescue his folks the dorky Pistachio transforms himself into many other dorky guises. The film is sloppy in its execution its gags and even its facts. One could swear a 10-year-old wrote the potty humor The villain (Brent Spiner) has a recurring problem with flatulence passing gas while maniacally laughing; Pistachio has a thing for huge backsides because his mama was a full-figured gal. Carvey was Mike Myers sidekick in Waynes World and he seems to be trying to create his own indelible character a la Myers Austin Powers. Even though none of his lines come close to Powers catchy ""Oh behave"" Pistachio dutifully repeats ""Its so crazy it just might work"" and ""Whos your Daddy?"" (They get no funnier with reiteration.) Dont expect a sequel about the Disguisey Dynasty. Pistachio is no Austin baby.

Directed by David Raynr . (Rated R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Using the stage as a launching pad for confessions finger-pointing foul- mouthed observations and deadpan imitations Martin Lawrence spares no one -- including himself -- in ""Martin Lawrence Live Runteldat"" a movie that is not only achingly funny but also full of serious and philosophical truisms. Filmed in January when Lawrence performed in Washington D.C. ""Martin Lawrence Live"" features the comedian-actor talking about race relations in a post-Sept. 11 America (""I havent seen this many black and white people coming together since Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney did Ebony and Ivory "") sex alcoholism the PBS series on civil rights called ""Eye on the Prize"" raising kids (""whip your childs ass if they act up"") marriage and the personal crises and police incidents that almost killed him and destroyed his career. Lawrence blames the media for sensationalizing his personal life including his bizarre 1996 shouting match with motorists and police on Ventura Boulevard in Los Angeles and his 1999 coma (which happened after he jogged in blazing temperatures and collapsed). Onstage and in front of the films cameras Lawrence acknowledges he was high on ""evil weed"" during the the 1996 incident and that the 1999 coma left him so crippled in a hospital he suffered from extreme incontinence -- an embarrassing lack of control he can now make fun of especially as he recalls the beautiful nurse who wiped him off day after day. ""This woman was cleaning doo-doo off me"" Lawrence marvels. ""I started falling in love (with her)."" Sex dominates his topics. There isnt a sexual subject he ignores whether its sexual organs sexual positions sexual practices or sexual taboos. Yes there is lots of crude language in ""Martin Lawrence Live"" but it fits the tone of Lawrences frenetic performance. Lawrence who starred in ""Black Knight"" ""Big Mommas House"" and ""Whats the Worst That Could Happen?"" slows down when he has to as when he talks about his failed marriage but its his wide-eyed rapid-fire comments that are most humorous and illuminating. ""Martin Lawrence Live"" captures a brilliant performer at the top of his craft. You dont have to agree with Lawrences opinions to appreciate his unique physical and mental gifts. . This film contains crude language about sex and other topics. -- Jonathan Curiel KARMEN GEI Musical drama. Starring Djeinaba Diop Gai Magaye Niang Stephanie Biddle Thierno Ndiaye Dos Djeynaba Niang and El Hadji Ndiaye. Directed and written by Joseph Gai Ramaka. (Not rated. 82 minutes. In French and Wolof with English subtitles. At the Castro Theatre.) . Linked in the public consciousness to composer Georges Bizet ""Carmen"" is probably the most famous opera in the world. With ""Karmen Gei"" director Joseph Gai Ramaka has set the story in his native Senegal replaced the music and choreography with African beats and moves and created a bisexual Carmen who may be the most magnetic most beautiful and bravest Carmen ever to grace a stage or film set. Actress Djeinaba Diop Gai pulsates with joie de vivre as the rebellious woman who seduces the warden of her prison engineers the rescue of a jailed suitor publicly belittles Senegals police corps and leads an idealistic gang of smugglers. (Her character is named Karmen not Carmen perhaps to differentiate her from all the previous incarnations of this operatic figure.) Gais Karmen has an infectious sense of humor which she uses to diffuse the men who are incredulous that such a striking woman can overpower them. The films levity (some of the scenes are almost campy) and playful spirited musical score make this version of ""Carmen"" even more unusual. American jazz saxophonist David Murray composed the songs which feature some of Senegals great performers including singer El Hadji Ndiaye who also has a role in the film. The movie is not without its flaws among them Gais singing voice which doesnt have the pitch or power of say Ndiayes. But there is so much working for ""Karmen Gei"" -- including the scenes of Goree Island where millions of slaves were first taken centuries ago; the colorful African fabrics that are worn by the women prisoners; and the portrayal of Karmen Gei as a kind of superhero to the downtrodden -- that the film becomes an overwhelming pleasure and you find yourself rooting for Gais character to avoid the fate that has befallen every other Carmen before her. . This film contains violence nudity and sex scenes. -- Jonathan Curiel  HAPPY TIMES  Drama. Starring Zhao Benshan and Dong Jie. Directed by Zhang Yimou. Written by Giu Zi. (Rated PG. 106 minutes. In Mandarin with English subtitles. Opens today at the Lumiere and Camera in San Jose; Aug. 9 at the Shattuck in Berkeley and Aquarius in Palo Alto; Aug. 16 at the Rafael in San Rafael.) . Zhang Yimou the Chinese director of ""Raise the Red Lantern"" ""Shanghai Triad"" and ""Ju Dou"" made an international reputation with vivid turbulent tales of passion and rebellion drawn against a canvas of Chinese history. More recently in ""The Road Home"" and ""Not One Less"" and the sentimental ""Happy Times"" Zhang tends toward melodrama played in a minor key. One feels the dimming of a certain ambition but in its place a sweetness clarity and emotional openness that recalls the classics of early Italian neorealism. Walking a sometimes-shaky line between tenderness and schmaltz ""Happy Times"" introduces Zhao (Zhao Benshan) an unemployed 50-plus hustler who pretends hes a wealthy hotel owner to impress the oversize divorcee (Dong Lihua) he hopes to marry. In fact his only ""hotel"" is an abandoned bus that he rents by the hour to amorous young couples. Zhaos intended is grumpy and demanding and when she pressures him to find a job for winsome Wu (Dong Jie) her blind 18-year-old stepdaughter Zhaos flimflammery spins out of control. Recruiting his retired pals he builds a faux massage parlor in a crumbling warehouse enlists said pals as customers and thinks hes fooled both Wu and the grump. Theres a maudlin quality to the poor blind teenager despised by her stepmother -- silent tearjerkers were rife with such characters -- and even with Zhangs polished direction Zhaos humor and Dongs quiet dignity one feels the manipulative tug of a baldly sentimental tale. Melodrama has its place though and Zhangs commitment to irony-free emotion -- the bond between Zhao and Wu the steadfast hope in her search for her father the devotion of Zhaos circle of friends -- is admirable. -- Edward Guthmann THE MASTER OF DISGUISE Comedy. Starring Dana Carvey  James Brolin and Jennifer Esposito . Directed by Perry Andelin Blake . (PG. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . Its a measure of this movies dreadfulness that the experience of ""The Master of Disguise"" is even worse for people who are particular fans of its star Dana Carvey. Heres a genuinely funny and engaging comedian and yet we find him pouring his energy and considerable good will into a string of not- funny not-distinct characters. At times it actually hurts to watch. Carvey plays an Italian immigrant Pistachio with a gift for complete transformation that hes inherited from his father Frabbrizio (James Brolin). But at the start of the movie hes a waiter in an Italian restaurant. He trips and several plates of spaghetti go flying landing on the heads of diners. After fumbling for a few seconds he tries to make amends by sprinkling the diners heads with Parmesan cheese. If Carvey were playing a complete idiot -- along the lines of a Jerry Lewis character -- the cheese bit might have been funny. But Pistachio inhabits a kind of dead zone between contemptible imbecile and sensitive bumbler. Hes not someone to laugh at and hes not someone to laugh with. Hes someone to endure. The story involves Pistachios coming into his birthright as a disguise master. In an effort to rescue his parents from a criminal mastermind (Brent Spiner) he assumes a number of identities -- a suave Englishman a bucktoothed Alpine and a man who inexplicably resembles a turtle. The movie is if anything an excuse for Carvey to don these personae but they all lack incisiveness and satirical punch -- as does Carveys softball imitation of George W. Bush who is seen trying to rescue an original copy of the Constitution of all things. The disguise gimmick is also an excuse for a number of celebrity cameos which culminate in a mask being pulled off to reveal Frabbrizio. The most interesting cameo is that of Bo Derek who appears in her ""10"" outfit from 1979 looking slightly better than she did 23 years ago. In a movie about transformation Derek shows that not transforming can sometimes be even more amazing. -- Mick LaSalle Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News In almost all of the articles written about Dana Carveys ""comeback"" in ""The Master of Disguise"" (Carvey took a few years off after undergoing botched bypass surgery) mention has been made of his ""disastrous"" 1996 ABC variety show. Used in a celebrity profile ""disastrous"" is code for ""commercial flop."" But the month or so that ""The Dana Carvey Show"" lasted proved that there was still something fresh and funny to be done in the abandoned television genre of variety shows. Aping 1950s variety shows (each week the show was named after its sponsor; ""The Mug Root Beer Dana Carvey Show"" for example) Carvey and his second bananas produced a little concussion grenade each week. With ""Saturday Night Live"" despite some sporadically good work long ago having settled into self-satisfaction Carveys short-lived half-hour was one of the only recent examples of unpredictability in TV comedy. There was literally no telling how far the show would go or what would come next. My favorite moments were Carvey as Prince Charles announcing that he was reclaiming the monarchical right of executing spouses (this was naturally before Dianas death) and an unbelievable commercial Carvey and Darrell Hammond did for that weeks sponsor Mountain Dew. Carvey pours a can of the yellowish-green liquid replete with big foamy head into a glass and asks Hammond ""Darrell what does that look like to you?"" Hammond seeking a graceful way out answers ""Well Dana it looks like a cool refreshing soft drink."" ""Yeah"" Carvey continues ""but what does it look like?"" Talk about biting the hand that feeds you Here was the host of a network variety show just about saying that the sponsors product resembled a glass of piss. Carvey the wild card is nowhere in evidence in the shockingly bad ""The Master of Disguise."" He plays Pistachio Disguisey (the comic poverty of that name is a red flag) the bumbling spawn of generations of disguise geniuses who takes a crash course in the family trade to win his parents back from the evil baddie (Brent Spiner) taking his revenge on them. Bits of the picture have a nice storybook look but theres barely a scene where the laughs dont thud. Its no shame that the script by Carvey and Harris Goldberg is a hook on which to get Carvey into all sorts of comic makeup. (There are a lot of terrific comedies that dont treat the plot as anything more than a contrivance.) You Might Also Like But Garth and the Church Lady aside Carveys real talent is for mimicry. The best bit here bears that out a parody of Robert Shaws hambone performance in ""Jaws"" (and in particular the blowhard macho hooey of the horrendous ""USS Indianapolis"" speech written for that movie by John Milius). The quick-sketch characters Carvey plays in the other scenes just cant match up -- and theyre off the screen before hes had a chance to kick around in them and come up with something original. Worse Carveys whole demeanor here is cloying in the extreme. Pistachio is a pale retread of Jerry Lewis comic spazzes and Carvey seems very aware in every scene of just how adorable hes being. Theres nothing like the tossed-off lived-in casualness of the personas Mike Myers dons in ""Goldmember."" With a PG rating and nothing racier than a few (bad) fart jokes ""The Master of Disguise"" is obviously aimed at the family market. I understand that at summer vacation time especially where the weather is sweltering a PG comedy can seem like a blessed respite for parents. But if you can get over the older kids fear of seeming uncool theres really no reason to go to ""The Master of Disguise"" with ""Stuart Little 2 around. That picture has some of the most satisfyingly crafted comic-adventure sequences of any recent movie. Its a family movie in the best sense sweet without being treacly and genuinely entertaining. For the older kids whove already heard their share of poo-poo jokes from their friends theres ""Goldmember"" which revels in exactly the sort of silliness kids love. I understand how hard it is for parents to find movies to take their kids to but the thought of them or their children getting stuck at this stinker galls me. Summer vacation feels short enough as it is. Charles Taylor is a columnist for the Newark Star-Ledger. More Charles Taylor.

"Isnt This Special? No - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Adam Sandler Isnt This Special? NoMovies - REVIEW - The Master of DisguiseThe Dana Carvey Of `Disguise Is No Church LadyAugust 2 2002|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticFans of Dana Carvey who are old enough to remember him fondly as the Church Lady and the first President Bush on Saturday Night Live can safely take a pass on The Master of Disguise.No amount of nostalgia for Carveys glory days can disguise the fact that the new film is a lame kiddie flick and that Carveys considerable talents are wasted in it.Carvey plays Pistachio Disguisey a waiter at his fathers Italian restaurant. What Pistachio doesnt know is that he comes from a long line of masters of disguise and that he has within him an innate ability to transform himself into anything from an Indian snake charmer to a cherry pie.But when Pistachios parents (James Brolin and Edie McClurg) are abducted by the evil Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) Pistachios grandfather (Harold Gould) shows up to tell the young waiter about his transformational legacy. Then after Pistachio acquires a ""beautiful assistant"" (Jennifer Esposito) its up to him to use his newfound talents to rescue his parents.Not only does Carvey appear as the title character he also co-wrote the script with Harris Goldberg (Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo). Is this how hes choosing to spend his time?Sad. Very sad.Directed by former production-designer Perry Andelin Blake The Master of Disguise (which opens today) is a rhythmless if generally innocuous collection of terminally silly gags. Some of these gags may tickle kids but relatively few of them will delight anyone else.One of the funnier jokes involves a list of the items that Bowman has stolen. It includes the Liberty Bell the Mona Lisa and Bruce Willis hairpiece from Die Hard 2.More typical is the running gag about Bowmans laugh. After every wild evil laugh the villain breaks wind. (OK maybe thats mildly funny the first time. But Bowman keeps doing it.)Carveys comedy brilliance surfaces only occasionally. Hes funny as a weird bloated turtle man who repeatedly says ""turtle"" in a Kermit-the-Frog kind of voice. But what he does here is usually just good enough to remind you of how funny he used to be.Carveys fellow SNL alum Adam Sandler is listed as an executive producer. And the whole project does have that Sandleresque dumb-comedy vibe.As Pistachio Carvey speaks with a simpy deliberately unconvincing Italian accent thats not so very different from that of Sandlers old Opera Man character. Even the name Pistachio Disguisey sounds like something Sandler might dream up in a moment of what passes for inspiration in his world.In the end The Master of Disguise isnt so much about Pistachio transforming himself into all kinds of characters as it is about Dana Carvey transforming himself into Adam Sandler.Sad. Very sad.

Running time 80 minutes. Rated PG (fart jokes sexual innuendo). At the Chelsea West the Union Square others. ------- NO one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through ""The Master of Disguise"" an unbearably tedious and unfunny comedy starring Dana Carvey and directed by Perry Andelin Blake. That soupy dreck like this received a big-screen release - when so many decent-to-excellent independent and foreign films never reache theaters at all - is simply sickening. Carveys Pistachio Disguisey (har har) is the slow-witted son of Frabbrizio Disguisey the last in a long line of ""masters of disguise."" Frabbrizio now runs a restaurant in America where Pistachio works as a waiter. One day Devlin Bowman a criminal mastermind who collects rare treasures kidnaps Pistachios parents. Pistachio has no idea what to do until his grandfather (Harold Gould) turns up to reveal the young mans inheritance and to instruct him in the art of disguise. With the help of Grandpa Pistachio hires an assistant and sets out to rescue his parents. What follows could hardly be more flaccidly unimaginative. In one of several sad attempts to entertain the parents of the kids the movie is aimed at there is a visual and musical reference to ""The Exorcist"" and Carveys Pistachio strains to imitate Al Pacino in ""Scarface"" complete with a bright red shirt and over-the-top Cuban accent. In this guise - and in all the others - Carvey tends to be grating and crude; he flubs even a George W. Bush imitation. Its as if the muse that inspired him on ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Waynes World"" has simply deserted him though the inept screenplay he wrote with Harris Goldberg would throw any performer off his game. As if mirthlessness stupidity and contempt for the audience werent crimes enough the makers of ""The Master of Disguise"" throw in jokes about farts and fat-bottomed girls and even one about a wiener thats grossly inappropriate for a PG movie. Producers rarely merit a mention in a review but Sid Ganis Alex Siskin Barry Bernardi Todd Garner Adam Sandler and the folk at Revolution Studios all bear responsibility for foisting ""The Master of Disguise"" on an undeserving public.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 02 2002 1200AM EDT Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 1254AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Master of Disguise Directed by Perry Andelin Blake Written by Dana Carvey and Harris Goldberg Starring Dana Carvey and Jennifer Esposito Classification PG Rating  The Master of Disguise is quite an artful dissembler. Despite all evidence to the contrary this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults. Now its one thing to pass off a forgery that closely resembles the real deal -- any fool can do that. But its another matter entirely when the fake is so transparently obvious -- that level of fraud takes a certain bold genius. So give these charlatans credit and lets just ponder what little they had to work with. Consider for example the script -- there isnt one. Oh actors speak words but the words have no sensible meaning and only a single purpose to give Dana Carvey an excuse to do countless impressions of people and animals and things. Of course as his years on Saturday Night Live amply proved Carvey is a very good impressionist. Yet we already know that. So it comes as no surprise that the guy can neatly impersonate an infantile Italian named Pistachio. Or an Indian snake charmer. Or a turtle. Or Robert Shaw acting in Jaws. Or George W. Bush acting as president. Or a cherry pie. He does a great cherry pie. Truly Carvey is a man of a thousand faces and not a few voices too. Still the niggling question remains Do a bunch of impressions a feature movie make? To his undying credit someone here -- perhaps the co-writer Harris Goldberg or the director Perry Andelin Blake or maybe Carvey himself -- answered with an emphatic ""No sirree."" A feature movie especially a comedy demands much more. Not anything so remarkable as a script or a smidgeon of wit or a theme but there are certain essentials that cant be ignored. And heres the list the sine qua non of comedic featuredom A fart joke. Hell just to be safe make that six or seven fart jokes all identical. A villain. For the sake of economy let him be the fellow who does all the farting thereby fulfilling two requirements in one. Close-ups of fat asses. Really fat asses. A pretty girl a.k.a. Jennifer Esposito a J.Lo wannabe whos no slouch in the posterior department herself. (Come to think of it there may be a theme here after all.) A midget. As Mike Myers Carveys old Waynes World buddy has so ably demonstrated a little person goes a long way toward ensuring comic success. Alas despite such a generous allotment of goodies -- the George Bushes and the cherry pies and the farts and the midgets -- the darn thing still comes in at barely 80 minutes. Not to worry -- just insert outtakes over the credits nearly 10 full minutes of outtakes. Add it all up and although theres nary a laugh to be found The Master of Disguise is assuredly a movie. Why? Because its bold dissemblers say so and will lighten your wallet for the privilege of disputing them.

Nonetheless vehicle for Dana Carvey as a chameleonic crime-fighting imbecile is noisy colorful and fart-gag-filled. Pretty much the definition of a kids-will-like/parents-will-hate-it movie ""The Master of Disguise"" is a jumbled fantasy comedy that -- judging from the endless final credits snips from presumably deleted scenes without which pic would barely scrape the 70-minute mark -- did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting shooting or post-production stages. Nonetheless vehicle for Dana Carvey as a chameleonic crime-fighting imbecile is noisy colorful and fart-gag-filled enough to amuse undiscriminating auds under the age of 10. B.O. in a summer field already crowded with bigger better family pics will likely be just OK. Once ""Master"" is available as a rewindable baby sitter however it should mint coin quite nicely. As for franchise aspirations writ all over pic that too may fly best -- if at all -- in direct-to-video sequels. Feature reps debut helming effort for Perry Andelin Blake hitherto known as a production designer -- notably on all of Adam Sandlers star vehicles with that gent returning the favor as an exec producer here. Most consistently pro elements in ""Master"" are indeed in the visual design department. Yet even those are a mishmash of whimsical/comic ideas that never quite connect. After the deliberately ""Harry Potter""-esque opening credits sequence theres an amusing enough 1979 prologue in which international black marketer Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) and his minions fail to catch a spy -- the alarmingly well-preserved Bo Derek in full ""10"" braided-hair regalia. Bo ""really"" turns out to be Frabbrizio Disguisey (James Brolin) scion of a family thats passed down master disguise skills over generational centuries. Bowman ends up spending the next two decades in hoosegow. By that terms end Frabbrizio has long since given up global intrigue for a Stateside Italian restaurant run with wife Mama (Edie McClurg one natural albeit under-used comic talent here) and inept waiter son Pistachio (Carvey). Dad has kept his only child innocent of the clan legacy though this talent often sneaks out irrepressibly via rude impersonations of rude people. When the vengeful Bowman kidnaps Papa and Mama Pistachio must save them. Hes aided by the sudden appearance of Grandpa (Harold Gould) who trains the young nitwit in ""Disguisey"" mastery. As assistant the duo hire comely single mom Jennifer (Jennifer Esposito) whose accident-prone tyke Barney (Austin Wolff) has already been befriended by our hero. Cluttered yet lacking any real narrative momentum pic becomes a series of dum-dum set pieces in which Carvey riffs aimlessly but strenuously as various unamusing characters. Among them are silly costume-stunt conceits (Turtle Man Cherry Pie Man even Human Cow Pie) ethnic stereotypes (Indian Bavarian Brit) and movie in-jokes (he does Robert Shaw in ""Jaws"" voice-impersonates dialogue from ""Shrek"" etc.). Meanwhile dad is forced by Bowman to steal U.S. national treasures -- the Constitution the Liberty Bell a space shuttle -- while disguised as teen popster Jessica Simpson wrestler-politico Jesse Ventura and superstar runner Michael Johnson. Latter all play themselves to no special benefit beyond name/face recognition. Pic scarcely seems to have established itself when it arrives at a rote climax as Pistachio rescues mom dad and Jennifer from the villains lair. There follows a dreadful epilogue that has Carvey impersonating our nations current prez then much-stretched-out closing credits featuring supposed bloopers outtakes and scene excerpts in which star does yet more uninspired wacky characters that apparently didnt make final cut. ""Master of Disguise"" is an awful mess by any grown-up standards but for better or worse its probably not half bad when considered from a grade school p.o.v. Lack of wit or coherence wont matter to viewers who just want slapstick simple bad taste yoks and fast-paced goofiness. Co-scenarist (with Harris Goldberg of ""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo"") Carvey has had a rough time finding his niche since ""Saturday Night Live"" and the ""Waynes World"" pics. His funny business here underlines the importance of good material -- entirely absent here -- for versatile comic talents but young auds may respond to the sheer exertion nonetheless. After all they liked the first ""Ace Ventura"" movie. One hopes Brolins Italian accent was intended to be clueless. Spiner endures a character whose every villainous rant is punctuated by rectal toot. The beauteous Esposito whos proven her acting chops in TVs ""Spin City"" and Spike Lees ""Summer of Sam"" deserves some sort of prize for having to maintain passive interest during innumerable scenes showcasing Carveys painful wackiness. Its surely the most thankless acting job seen onscreen in recent months. Design contribbers come off best patchwork as ""Master"" still seems. Other tech aspects are pro.

Then Mama and Papa are kidnapped and Pistachio has to save the day.This involves pretending to be variously a turtle-man; a guy who seems to be Al Pacino doing Sonny Bono; Robert Shaw from Jaws; and Terry Suave a Scotland Yard smoothie. There are other characters and costumes but they are like the movie itself totally lame.Rated PG to draw in an undiscerning kiddie crowd The Master of Disguise features a flatulent villain (Brent Spiner) bent on stealing the worlds greatest treasures (such as the Liberty Bell the Mona Lisa Bruce Willis hairpiece from Die Hard 2). Jennifer Esposito is on board as Pistachios assistant and Jessica Simpson Jesse Ventura and Bo Derek make cameos that they will probably regret for the rest of their lives.The Master of Disguise  (Out of four stars)Written by Dana Carvey and Harris Goldberg directed by Perry Andelin Blake.

"Carvey Comedy Is Master of Very Little - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsCarvey Comedy Is Master of Very LittleAugust 02 2002|KEVIN THOMAS | TIMES STAFF WRITER ""The Master of Disguise"" sounds as if it should be a natural for Dana Carvey who has created a gallery of hilarious characters and impersonations on ""Saturday Night Live"" and elsewhere. But even his protean talent cant dent this ponderously unfunny and uninspired comedy. Its hard to imagine anyone older than 10 being diverted by its broad buffoonery and kids deserve better than this in the first placeIts even harder to imagine that Carvey is actually credited with co-writing the script (with Harris Goldberg) but its true. Anyway Carvey is Pistachio a nerdy waiter in his fathers Italian restaurant apparently in New Yorks Little Italy (but clearly on a studio back lot). Pistachio has a compulsive habit of mimicking the restaurants patrons but his father Frabbrizio (James Brolin) who emigrated from Palermo with his family in 1979 has never told his son that they come from an ancient line of masters of disguise crime fighters as effective as Superman. But a close call in the guise of Bo Derek--dont ask--left Frabbrizio eager to pursue less risky work.The bad guy Bowman (Brent Spiner) whom Frabbrizio packed off to prison has served his sentence and is out for revenge. When Frabbrizio is kidnapped by Bowman and Frabbrizios wife (Edie McClurg) is diabolically endangered as well its time for Pistachios Grandfather (Harold Gould) to pop up and teach his grandson the tricks of the ancient House of Disguisey. This is the premise for the series of clunky witless adventures Pistachio has with his glamorous newly hired assistant (Jennifer Esposito)Remarkably little that Carvey does in his various disguises is even faintly amusing. Gould frenetically goes over the top but Brolin wisely takes a more relaxed approach and comes up with the best semblance of an Italian accent of the three. Not much of Esposito is demanded beyond looking good which she does and Spiner is stuck in a stock villain part who has a chronic affliction that could well be taken as symbolic of a picture that is such a stinker.It is not entirely surprising to learn that first-time filmmaker Perry Andelin Blake who directs with a sledgehammer touch has been a production designer. The film which mercifully runs but 80 minutes has an artificial fantasy look that is more amusing and imaginative in its baroque gaudiness than in any other of its aspects. ""Disguise the limit"" is the films punning promotional slogan but ""Rock Bottom"" is more like it.MPAA rating PG for mild language and some crude humor.
