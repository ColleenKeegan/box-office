By Ben Sachs 1bsachs Minions Minions  Directed by Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin Ive developed a serious pet peeve against childrens animations that rely on celebrity voices. Cartoon characters can change their shape and body language at will yet most movie stars and pop singers are strongly associated with a particular--and often limited--vocal style. The novelty of hearing a stars voice emanate from an unrecognizable form grows old quickly which may explain why so few star-studded animations linger in the popular consciousness. Except for toddlers parked in front of the flat-screen by their parents does anyone still watch the DreamWorks releases Shark Tale (with Will Smith Angelina Jolie and Robert De Niro) Over the Hedge (with Bruce Willis and William Shatner) or MegaMind (with Brad Pitt Tina Fey and Jonah Hill)? Kids loved Despicable Me (2010) and Despicable Me 2 (2013) though they probably couldnt have cared less that Steve Carell provided the voice of Gru the supervillain protagonist. They were more interested in the minions a race of little yellow accident-prone creatures who tried (and often failed) to assist him in his mischief. Given voice by series codirector Pierre Coffin the minions sound like a cross between small children and big birds chirping and squawking in a private language of gibberish and random bits of English Spanish and Italian. Their silly speech is an effective sonic analogue to the sight gags in which theyre regularly involved; it seems to grow organically out of the films exaggerated visual design. Minions the third entry in the cycle is essentially a series of sight gags many of them amusing and some of them laugh-out-loud funny. Set arbitrarily in 1968 the story follows three of the creatures on a worldwide search for a new evil genius whom their race can serve. Their quest takes them to Orlando--where they attend a ""Villain Con"" based on contemporary fan conventions--and then to London where their new boss (given uninteresting voice by Sandra Bullock) plans to steal the royal crown. The overarching joke of the film is that the minions render adorable everything they touch; even before they inadvertently foil some evil plot they undermine it simply by attending its creation. I got tired of this joke before the movie ended but I appreciate the gusto with which the filmmakers--particularly Coffin with his nimble vocalizations--carried it out.  v Trailer More Movie Review >> Tags Movie Review Kyle Balda Pierre Coffin Minions Despicable Me Despicable Me 2 Dreamworks Shark Tale Over the Hedge Bruce Willis William Shatner Robert De Niro Steve Carrell MegaMind Brad Pitt Tina Fey Jonah Hill Sandra Bullock Video Email Share Digg Newsvine del.icio.us Facebook Reddit Twitter Windy Citizen Add to favorites Saving...

The three non-human stars are leader Kevin babyish Bob and the ukulele-toting Stuart all voiced by co-director Pierre Coffin in a mix of Spanish Italian and French and occasionally English-sounding gibberish. At the world premiere of animated film Minions in London Sandra Bullock discusses finally playing a villain and acting out alone in front of a microphone while co-directors Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin talk about humanizing the critters. (June 12) AP Video Video Video Sandra Bullock rules the Minions in newest film The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way To get some idea of the pace of the movie the intro covers the entire length of planetary life from the primordial soup to the recent past in the first few minutes.Narrator Geoffrey Rush tells how Minions have been oriented toward serving evil masters for millennia but given the Minion gift for mayhem those leaders usually come to a bad end. The list includes a Tyrannosaurus rex a pharaoh Count Dracula and Napoleon who somehow drives them to an Antarctic cave where the Minion species is in danger of extinction from the lack of stimulating mischief.Jump to 1968 and three brave Minions end up in New York and in a series of slapstick visual gags almost leave the city upended. From this point the soundtrack tunes in to a constant series of classic rock golden oldies kicked off by the Rolling Stones 19th Nervous Breakdown.After discovering the phenomenon of television the Minions learn about the Villain-Con taking place in Orlando and they head off in search of a new evil master. En route they hitch a ride with a chatty American family called the Nelsons (an Ozzie amp; Harriet reference?). The parents voiced by Michael Keaton and Allison Janney turn out to be Bonnie and Clyde-style bank robbers. The Nelsons too are headed to Villain-Con and excited to see the conventions inspirational headliner Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) a motivational speaker with megalomaniacal tendencies.In a jiffy the Minions have signed up as Scarlets personal aides and together they head off to London where Scarlet and her too-groovy husband inventor Herb (Jon Hamm) plan to steal the crown of Queen Elizabeth. The Queen (voiced by Jennifer Saunders) is portrayed as a slightly petulant diva but over all a pretty nice girl.With its episodic stream of slapstick gags Minions has moments of piquant absurdity but mostly its shrill-but-cutesy anarchy works as a visual sugar rush for the preschool set. At the same time the references to the Beatles Japanese monster movies and the musical Hair seem aimed not at parents but at babysitting grandparents who can nod along to Donovans Mellow Yellow and not worry too much about when they lost the plot.Editors note Scarlet Overkills name was misspelled in the original version of this article.

"Minions - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Minions Posted by Christy Lemire on July 12 2015 3 Comments Universal Pictures Rated PG for action and rude humor. Running time 91 minutes. Two stars out of four. We are a Minion-friendly household around here. My 5-year-old son Nicolas loves the Minions so much he thinks he actually IS one. Weve been on the ""Despicable Me"" ride at Universal Studios more times than I can count. (It is kind of a blast though.) We have Minion stuffed toys Minion books the ""Minion Rush"" iPad game even Minion apple sauce (which tastes like tropical ba-na-nas). So I was all in for ""Minions"" a prequel to the ""Despicable Me"" movies which explains the origins of these impish yellow creatures and follows their quest to find the most evil villain to serve. Its a clever idea but it can only go so far before running out of steam. These guys are as silly and playful and hilariously inept as ever but theres not much to them. Fittingly because theyre pill-shaped the Minions work best in small doses. The three goggle-eyed guys at the center of ""Minions"" -- Kevin Stuart and Bob -- have distinct personalities but theres no ""there"" there to build an entire film around. And the super villain they work for this time doesnt have the strength of character or the complexity of Steve Carells vaguely Eastern European baddie-turned-daddy Gru. I realize these are all the observations of a film critic and a grown-ass person. Young kids who truly are the target audience wont notice or care about any of this. They will laugh their heads off. Nicolas was cackling so hard the veins in his neck were popping out. (His favorite part was when the three are stranded at sea and Stuart tries to eat Kevin in a hallucinatory fit of hunger.) But first we must go back to the dawn of time and the birth of the Minions. As Geoffrey Rush explains in a lengthy and amusing opening narration the Minions have long sought to do the bidding of the baddest person they can find -- although their earliest boss was a T. rex. Then there was a caveman and Dracula and Napoleon but invariably these crazy creatures screwed something up and had to move on. After decades of self-imposed exile in an ice cave -- and the depression that resulted from a loss of purpose -- one enterprising Minion the tall and responsible Kevin takes it upon himself to venture out and find a new big boss for the tribe to serve. His traveling companions are the suave ukelele-playing Stuart and the innocent big-hearted Bob. Co-director Pierre Coffin voices all of these characters as always with a gibberishy mish-mosh of French Spanish and who-knows-what. Words like ""banana"" ""papaya"" and ""pinata"" appear frequently in their vocabulary but Ive gotta say I understood a lot of what they were talking about. After traveling over land and sea they wind up in 1968 New York and then in Orlando Florida for the annual Villain Con gathering of evildoers. (""Minions"" just happens to be hitting theaters the same weekend Comic-Con is going on in San Diego. Coincidence?) There they connect with the worlds first female super villain the coifed and polished Scarlet Overkill voiced with perky menace by Sandra Bullock. Shes entertaining at first but eventually reveals herself to be shrill one-note and off-putting as she unleashes her devious plan to steal Queen Elizabeth IIs crown and take over England. (Jon Hamm provides the voice of her mod husband and henchman Herb Overkill.) Journeying across the Atlantic leads to a bunch of really easy jokes about British culture but also an impressive soundtrack of great 60s hits by The Beatles The Who The Rolling Stones The Kinks Jimi Hendrix and more. (The makers of ""Minions"" spent an insane amount of money on music including of course Donovans ""Mellow Yellow."") Kevin Stuart and Bob bumble and stumble their way through it all in their usual slapsticky fashion. But in retrospect I cant really recall a single joke or sight gag or action sequence that stands out above all the rest. Coffin and co-director Kyle Baldas film written by Brian Lynch just kind of chugs along until it reaches its explosive conclusion and then it ends. Its cute. Its OK. But its never great. Your kids will probably love it though. And youll wish you were watching ""Inside Out"" for the second time instead. Tweet Category Reviews Tags animated comedy Despicable Me family Geoffrey Rush Jon Hamm Kyle Balda Pierre Coffin Sandra Bullock Steve Carell 3 Comments on ""Minions"" July 13 2015  by  GinaB     This movie is meant to warp young minds to believe its good to follow evil...Never again will any of the Kids I have or School will ever see minions or any other childrens movies until I review them..Absolutely a disgrace...but in line with a warped minds. Reply July 26 2015  by  Vasco     I disagree with you GinaB. We see them look for an evil villain but in the end they are trying to do the right thing and fought against the villain. And as we know Gru starts a villain but turns out a hero and the minions continues to follow him. So in my point of view they are looking for a leader not exactly a villain.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Jul 10 2015 Culture Minions the spinoff/prequel of Universal Pictures Despicable Me movies begins fittingly enough at the very beginning In a protean sea single-celled creatures compete and evolve predators and prey growing in tandem. But whos that there dangling off the tail fin of a particularly wicked-looking fish? Why its a minion one of those little lemon Tic Tacs of servility who worked for the supervillain Gru in the prior films. A narrator (Geoffrey Rush) explains that while not all minions are created alike--some have one eye some two; some are taller some rounder--""they all share the same goal to serve the most despicable master they can find.""Cue history. The minions graduate from fish groupies to dinosaur groupies before taking an inevitable step backward with the arrival of human beings. Caveman pharaoh vampire Napoleon--all are tried on for size as masters but none quite fit. So the minions retreat to an arctic cavern where they build their own society in seclusion.But something is still missing. The minions are like rogue planets lost in space bereft of a star to orbit. So three members of the colony--Kevin Stuart and Bob--set out to find a suitably despicable master. (All of the minions are voiced as before by director Pierre Coffin in their distinctive pidgin mishmash of English Spanish French Italian and sheer gibberish.)Related Story With Inside Out Pixar Returns to Form The year is by now 1968 which means that the Minions soundtrack will make amiable (if not terribly imaginative) use of the Rolling Stones The Who the Doors the Beatles The Spencer Davis Group and the theme song from Hair. The minions first arrive in New York but while flipping channels on a department-store TV--The Saint Bewitched The Dating Game--they stumble across a secret channel announcing the upcoming Villain-Con convention to be held in Orlando. (In one of the movies better gags 1968 Orlando is portrayed as essentially an empty swamp.) At Villain-Con the minions meet and sign on with the worlds self-described greatest supervillain Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) who whisks them off to London where the central plot will unfold. Because you know groovy baby.There Scarlet and her doting husband Herb Overkill (Jon Hamm) charge the minions with stealing Saint Edwards Crown from Queen Elizabeth II (Jennifer Saunders). As an additional incentive Scarlet makes clear that if they fail she will be slicing herself some filet minion. Hijinks ensue as Kevin Stuart and Bob bounce from the Tower of London to the site of Excalibur to Westminster Abbey. Double-crosses (some inadvertent) are perpetrated on all sides and chase scene follows closely upon chase scene.Theres plenty of high-velocity comic inanity on display to keep kids happily diverted and the minions themselves are consistently amusing. (Though unsurprisingly they demonstrate that theyre better suited to be comic grace notes than full-on protagonists.) The movies major problem is an extension of its own premise Search as they may the minions never find a villain worthy of their subservience. Scarlet Overkill is a slapdash figure who never coheres as a character and Bullock isnt a gifted enough comedienne to elevate the material shes been given. (Kristen Wiig was far better in a less-central role in Despicable Me 2.) And casting Hamm as Scarlets debonair man-of-the-sixties husband is a one-note gag that never finds its proper key.This discrepancy between Minions and the Despicable Me movies is made all too clear at the very end when the film comes full circle and a new villain briefly appears on the scene a young boy with a beak-like nose and an accent of indeterminate Eastern European origin. The minions recognize his qualities immediately and so do we Finally--but alas too late for this installment--a master whose despicability is beyond reproach.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.)

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Minions Those adorable yellow mini-dudes from Despicable Me get their own movie -- and the result is a bust Bob Kevin and Stuart need a ride to Villain-Con in Minions. Credit Universal Pictures/Illumination Entertainment By Peter Travers July 10 2015 More News 7 Best Movies of 2015 So Far Brad Bird on Science-Geek Blockbuster Tomorrowland Readers Poll The 10 Best Robots in Movie History All Stories >> Can there really be too much of a cute thing? Im talking about the minions -- those tiny yellow goggle-eyed creatures who served the villainous Gru (indelibly voiced by Steve Carell) in two Despicable Me blockbusters. Its not whether this prequel can mint money; thats a given. The questions is Can the minions carry a movie all by their mischievous mini-selves? More News 7 Best Movies of 2015 So Far Brad Bird on Science-Geek Blockbuster Tomorrowland Readers Poll The 10 Best Robots in Movie History All Stories >> Related Summer Movie Preview 2015 From Superheroes to Strippers From Age of Ultron and Fury Road to Jurassic World the seasons epic sizzlers are big mean and mad as hell Fraid not. This origin story while being utterly harmless and far from despicable wears out its welcome way too soon. For starters all the good stuff is front-loaded. Thats a prologue that traces the minion story from the time of the T-Rex through Dracula Napoleon and whole slew of evildoers. The movie directed by Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin from a script by Brian Lynch never tops that inspired intro. In their search for the ultimate villain the minions -- led by Kevin Stuart and Bob (all voiced in delightful gibberish by Coffin) -- hit a few dead ends including a family of crooks (dad is voiced by Michael Keaton mom by Allison Janney). At a Villain-Con convention in Orlando they find the scheming Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and her inventor husband Herb (Jon Hamm). Scarlet enlists their help in stealing Queen Elizabeths crown. Its a botch job much like the movie. Its always fun to watch the minions shake their sillies out. But occupying the star spot instead of the chorus is a burden these fabulous freaks cant quite shoulder.

A Richard Nixon joke? The Sydney Australia skyline? The Beatles crossing Abbey Road? Even if these are included for parents a la the ""Shrek"" franchises pop culture references they seem a bit up there.No matter the silliness is what counts and silliness abounds. We start at evolutions beginning -- Christian fundamentalists may want to shield their childrens eyes -- where the minions tiny little yellow pill-shaped creatures realize even at a cellular level that its wise to follow and serve the strongest baddest creature around.Thus does a small horde of minions emerge from the sea following some slimy creature who has sprouted legs. Soon enough they are serving a T Rex then a dominant caveman -- the minions apparently being immortal -- and a dictatorial general.Theres only one problem. Well-intentioned as they may be the minions have a bad habit of inadvertently killing off the evil masters they serve whether through bad advice clumsiness or naivete. After botching one too many campaigns they retreat to an underground ice cave where they build a spiffy little minion city and break into spontaneous musical numbers.Which is OK for a while but eventually boredom sets in. They need a boss to serve. So an enterprising minion named Kevin -- the minions dont speak English but they seem to have English names -- decides to journey back to the world outside and search for an evil leader they can serve. Accompanying him is a rebel of sorts named Stuart and a sweet little (even by minion standards) dolt named Bob.The trio end up in New York City -- the year is 1968 -- where they hear about a villains convention in then undeveloped Orlando. Hitching a ride there they meet and win over the top villain of the day Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock). She takes them to London where they meet her gadget-obsessed husband Herb (Jon Hamm) and discover her ultimate goal She wants to steal the crown of the Queen of England.Which the minions must do for her. Or else.One of the great wonders of this movie is how much the minions -- all voiced by director Pierre Coffin who also directed the ""Despicable Me"" movies theyre derived from -- talk while making no discernable sense. English Spanish and French phrases pop up and then get swallowed in unintelligible garble. Certain words -- ""Kumbaya"" and ""King Bob"" -- serve key functions but for the most part its pure babble. Reading the script (by Brian Lynch) must have been an adventure.""Minions"" doesnt have the layers and insights of Pixars recent ""Inside Out""; in truth it doesnt have any layers and insights at all. Its playing for fun and that it has plenty of.

"Minions | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; minions ) Minions (United States 2015) July 09 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Despicable Me duology one of the best non-Pixar animated series to reach the silver screen in recent years was successful with kids and adults for different reasons. Older viewers appreciated its tongue-in-cheek wit and satirical aspects. Children on the other hands flocked to theaters for one reason Minions. The cute yellow creatures were everywhere Happy Meal toys stickers video games stuffed animals sheets etc. The Minions are a marketing goldmine so its no surprise they now have their own movie. Equally its no surprise that Minions is pitched almost exclusively to the under-9 crowd. This is a family picture in name only. Its a kids film that adults will be able to tolerate. Random innuendos and pop references (Richard Nixon The Beatles) represent the pinnacle of ""mature"" content. Minions fails to engage older viewers on the level achieved by the concurrent Inside Out. But children will love it because they adore the Minions. There isnt much of a story.  The narrative such as it is exists as an excuse to get Minions on the screen for 90 minutes. Its occasionally amusing but considering how funny Despicable Me and Despicable Me 2 were comically disappointing. Many of the jokes are either obvious or have been exposed through pre-release marketing material. I kept waiting for the clever or insightful moment that never arrives. The bar is set pretty low for Minions. The film opens with an extended prologue illustrating how the Minions have existed since prehistoric times repeatedly attaching themselves to the biggest Bad Dude around. These sequences are entertaining but because they form the backbone of one of the trailers theres nothing new here. The story gets underway in 1968 with three Minions - Kevin Bob and Stuart (all voiced by Pierre Coffin) - headed to Orlando for ""Villain-Con"" where they hope to attach themselves to the gloriously evil Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) as her new henchmen. Mission accomplished they accompany Scarlett and her husband Herb (Jon Hamm) to London where she plans to steal the Crown Jewels and depose Queen Elizabeth. In that caper however the Minions prove to be more of an impediment than an asset and their unhelpful actions soon earn Scarletts wrath. Minions is replete with missed opportunities. The prologue could have shown additional instances of Minion mishaps fouling up history. ""Villain-con"" a riff on Comic-con is neutered satirically. A ripe chance to parody giant monster movies is mostly bypassed. There are times when Kevin Bob and Stuart are more annoying than appealing (their inability to speak English isnt an asset). The ending is silly and nonsensical - not that anyone should expect a glorified cartoon to be coherent. By this point the producers pandering to their young target audience give up any attempt to be intelligible. The one overt Valentine to adults is the soundtrack which is crammed with songs that no one under 10 will recognize. The Spencer Davis Group The Doors The Who The Beatles and many many others get ""airplay."" Its like an oldies station - no Katy Perry Taylor Swift or anyone todays children are likely to be familiar with. The tunes predominantly play in the background - this isnt a musical animated feature - the only dance number occurs after the end credits. (If the children arent restless its worth staying.) The cast features some recognizable names but expert performances camouflage familiar voices. Sandra Bullock embraces the bold over-the-top essence of her character. No one would identify Jon Hamm or Michael Keaton unless informed beforehand of their participation. Steve Carells cameo is welcome but he speaks only a few lines. As a narrator Geoffrey Rush may lack the gravitas of Morgan Freeman but hes fine for the material. The animation is generic 2015 computer-generated material. Theres nothing eye-popping or groundbreaking here. Unlike Inside Out which tries some interesting techniques Minions sticks to a tried-and-true approach. The 3-D is lackluster. Oddly the best usage of 3-D occurs during the post-credits sequence making one wonder why the filmmakers couldnt have done better with the film as a whole. Theoretically Minions will vie with Inside Out for the same audience (both after all are animated) but the reality may be different. Nuanced and magical the latter film has a broad enough appeal to enchant viewers of all ages. Inconsistent and undisciplined Minions is more an adjunct to marketing than a legitimate motion picture. Adults without kids may be momentarily diverted but no more. Parents will get more pleasure out of their childrens reactions than from the film itself.

Minions are not so mellow yellow review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMinions are not so mellow yellow reviewThe yellow gibberish-spouting Minions go from sidekicks to headliners with uneven results in animated movie Minions.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. July 9 2015MinionsStarring Pierre Coffin Sandra Bullock Jon Hamm Michael Keaton Allison Janney Jennifer Saunders and Steve Carell. Directed by Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin. 91 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. GTheres a reason why second bananas (especially ones that sort of look like bananas) dont get starring roles.Take the Minions who have vaulted from the bumbling slapstick sidekicks to criminal mastermind Gru (Steve Carell) in Despicable Me and its sequel to become headliners with Minions.Article Continued BelowThe yellow capsule-shaped gibberish-spouting scene stealers were a hit with small and big viewers in their Despicable days. So they got their own movie specifically team leader Kevin one-eyed ukulele-strummer Stuart and pint-sized odd-eyed Bob their signature gibberish of fractured Spanish-Italian-English and menu items voiced by Pierre Coffin (Despicable Me 2).Opening with a history lesson the Minions evolution from single-celled blobs to single-minded creatures whose only pack-mentality motivation is to serve the biggest baddie they can find gets an entertaining origin story narrated by Geoffrey Rush.The action shifts to 1968 New York as Kevin Stuart and Bob search for a new evil boss for their tribe to serve. Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock not quite pulling it off) billed as the greatest evildoer of her time if TV ads for upcoming criminal fan expo Villain-Con are any indication ticks every Minion box. A bank-robbing family (the adults voiced by Michael Keaton and Allison Janney) helps the hitchhiking Minions get to Orlando for Villain-Con. Thats where Scarlet takes them on as her new henchmen and spends the rest of the movie treating them like doormats -- which the Minions love.Her crazed plan to steal Queen Elizabeths crown (Ab-Fabs Jennifer Saunders does a fine job as a loopy Liz) was born of childhood obsession. Shes aided by her dim-wit hubby a mod named Herb (a scene-stealing Jon Hamm of Mad Men). But she needs Kevin Stuart and Bob to do the deed leading to all manner of crazed antics.The Minions are happy to get work with Scarlet Overkill their evil boss.Theres no doubt the Minions are entertaining and the silly randomness of the activity will keep kids happy even if parents may start eying the exit. And there are funny bits including Stuarts awkward attempt to romance a fire hydrant and Bobs new-found furry best friend. But few gags hit solidly. Minions relies on mayhem too often -- too loud too much and too pointless.The 1960s soundtrack including the Rolling Stones and The Beatles seems a puzzling addition but perhaps its there to target a new market for kids films the grandparents who pay for tickets popcorn and post-show burger-toy combos.

"Review Minions has irresistible wonky golden touch - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Minions has irresistible wonky golden touch Minions Illumination Entertainment / Universal Pictures via AP Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) with minions Stuart Kevin and Bob in ""Minions."" Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) with minions Stuart Kevin and Bob in ""Minions."" (Illumination Entertainment / Universal Pictures via AP) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Who doesnt love the minions? Nominally devoted to evil but also to borrow a phrase from Raymond Chandler cute as lace pants these capsule-shaped and overall-wearing creatures are so appealing that even those not wild about ""Despicable Me"" found them difficult to resist.But could these wacky wayfarers carry an entire movie on their own or would they be doomed to eternal second-bananahood relegated to supporting tacky villains who lacked their ineffable effervescence? Now ""Minions"" the movie is here and the news is good. As written by Brian Lynch and directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda ""Minions"" all-silliness all-the-time philosophy will put a smile on faces and keep it there like a fizzy beverage on a hot afternoon.INDIE FOCUS Sign up for our weekly movies newsletter Set up as a kind of cracked prequel to the previous ""Despicable Me"" features ""Minions"" is not any great shakes in terms of plot -- and what it has runs out of steam before the end -- but in a film like this the story is only an excuse to hang amusing characters and gags on and ""Minions"" has both in abundance. Minions to bring mayhem to box office Saba Hamedy ""Minions"" is expected to bring their mayhem to the box office this weekend as family films continue to draw in large numbers of moviegoers. Universal Pictures animated film an extension of the ""Despicable Me"" franchise is tracking to make between 95 million to 110 million according to people... ""Minions"" is expected to bring their mayhem to the box office this weekend as family films continue to draw in large numbers of moviegoers. Universal Pictures animated film an extension of the ""Despicable Me"" franchise is tracking to make between 95 million to 110 million according to people... (Saba Hamedy) Combining the inventive visual slapstick of old Looney Tunes efforts and the wisenheimer sensibility of ""Rocky and His Friends"" ""Minions"" is rich in situations it can put its antic yellow creatures into.And Coffin who co-directed both ""Despicable Me"" films also excels at voicing the amusing polyglot nonsense language that is the essential lingua franca of Miniondom.""It is gibberish"" Coffin confirmed to Britains the Guardian newspaper. ""Its a mixture of all the languages of the world and its about finding a particular magical rhythm and melody that makes the nonsense make sense."" Pixars Inside Out magically brings emotions to life Kenneth Turan Pixar stands alone and ""Inside Out"" shows you why. At once sophisticated and simple made with visual magic and emotional sensitivity casually probing deeper questions about what matters in life ""Inside Out"" typifies the best of that cartoon colossus. It goes not only to places other animation... Pixar stands alone and ""Inside Out"" shows you why. At once sophisticated and simple made with visual magic and emotional sensitivity casually probing deeper questions about what matters in life ""Inside Out"" typifies the best of that cartoon colossus. It goes not only to places other animation... (Kenneth Turan) These minions not only talk they are quite fond of singing in their particular way as well and because ""Minions"" is set in the 1960s you can hear these little guys tackle everything from the theme from ""The Monkees"" to the Beatles ""Revolution.""Even better for the films energy level many of its sequences are set to an exceptional collection of 60s rock classics like the Kinks ""You Really Got Me"" the Whos ""My Generation"" the Doors ""Break on Through (To the Other Side)"" the Box Tops ""The Letter"" the Rolling Stones ""19th Nervous Breakdown"" the Spencer Davis Groups ""Im a Man."" And more.""Minions"" begins not in the 1960s but as narrator Geoffrey Rush tells us at the very dawn of time. ""Minions"" he wonderfully intones ""have been on the planet longer than we have"" and their goal has always been the same to serve the most despicable master they could find.But because the minions bring bad luck and even accidental death to masters who comically include such figures as Napoleon and Dracula they are often on their own a state that leaves them listless and even depressed.To rescue them from that terminal lethargy minion Kevin comes up with a plan. He will venture out into the wider world and accompanied only by harebrained would-be rocker Stuart and the overly enthusiastic Bob thats just what he does.The minions quest initially lands them in New York in 1968 where we watch them acquire their trademark overalls. Their attention is caught by a TV spot for a convention in Orlando Fla. called Villain Con the worlds premier gathering of evildoers. Just the place they figure to find the villain of their dreams.After hitching a ride with a family of dubious morality whose car license plate reads ""Luv 2 Rob"" (parents voiced by Michael Keaton and Allison Janney) the minions find themselves irresistibly drawn to the conventions keynote address to be given by Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) the worlds first female super villain whose motto is ""Doesnt it feel so good to be bad.""Calling the trio ""my knights in shining denim"" Scarlet takes the minions on staff and also brings them back to London with her on her private jet (crime really does pay in this movie.)She introduces the guys to her mod-dressing mad scientist husband Herb Overkill (Jon Hamm) and gives them an assignment they dare not screw up Steal the crown off the head of Elizabeth II and pass it on to Scarlet. Or else.As noted the plotting in ""Minions"" does go a bit wonky (would you believe Bob as the king of England?) but it matters not. Minions provide endless amusement just by being themselves and how many of todays movie characters can you say that about?Twitter KennethTuran------------MinionsMPAA rating PG for action and rude humorRunning time 1 hour 44 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Sandra Bullock PG Rated Movies Geoffrey Rush Elizabeth II Minion Mayhem leads to attendance jump for Universal Studios Hollywood Kenneth Turans DVD picks Movies with music from Bugs Bunny to Black Flag Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-minions-review-20150710-column.html,200,minions10,minions,latimes

Photo Credit Illumination Entertainment advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The origin story of the little yellow creatures from the ""Despicable Me"" movies. Rated PG (for action and rude humor) BOTTOM LINE A loud frenetic kid pleaser though parents brains may short-circuit. CAST Voices of Sandra Bullock Jon Hamm Michael Keaton LENGTH 128 Small children rejoice Your favorite animated characters from Universals ""Despicable Me"" franchise are starring in their own feature film. Thats right the babbling little imps who lend their name to ""Minions"" can now frolic fall down and blow things up without the usual boring movie stuff like plot and character. ""Minions"" may be your parents idea of a nightmare but its your dream come true. Youll remember that the yellow pill-shaped Minions were the clumsy henchmen of the supervillain Gru (voice of Steve Carell) in 2010s ""Despicable Me."" But where did they come from? ""Minions"" explains that they evolved over millennia always serving ""the most despicable master they could find"" from the T. rex to Napoleon. Did you ever wonder why we would root for such misguided heroes? Or whose side they took during say World War II? Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? No matter. Whats important is that in 1968 three Minions -- Kevin Stuart and Bob whose Esperanto-esque chatter comes from director Pierre Coffin -- travel to Swingin London to join the evil Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock). Scorned as a child Scarlet now dreams of stealing Queen Elizabeth IIs crown and ruling all of England. At her side is her husband Herb (Jon Hamm) a dead ringer for Pete Townshend in a mod suit. Their clear American accents are good examples of the movies inattention to detail. (Michael Keaton Allison Janney and Steve Coogan also play small roles.) Hear that music kids? Those guitar-driven songs -- the Kinks ""You Really Got Me"" the Spencer Davis Groups ""Im a Man"" The Whos ""My Generation"" -- are called classic rock. Theyre here to keep grown-ups tapping their toes while their brains sit unused. If your old man looks slightly bummed out its only because the soundtrack of his youth has been stripped of all meaning. Just wait itll happen to you too. When that day comes you might also start caring about things like narrative clarity and internal logic. For now though ""Minions"" has all the loud noises and frenetic nonsense you could want in a movie. When the end credits roll remember to thank your parents. MoviesBig movies out this summer ----- advertisement | advertise on newsday MOVIES THAT FEATURED THE COLOR YELLOW  Color us excited that the Minions the cute yellow bumblers from the ""Despicable Me"" movies are starring in their own movie which opens Friday. Here are four more films in which yellow was a primary color. THE WIZARD OF OZ (1939) -- This classic features more colors than Crayola could have imagined from its sepia opening to the Horse of a Different Color. But the most important shade belongs to the Yellow Brick Road that Dorothy and her pals follow to reach the Emerald City. THE YELLOW ROLLS-ROYCE (1964) -- Despite a heavyweight cast that included Rex Harrison Ingrid Bergman and Shirley MacLaine the real scene stealer of this star vehicle was the title automobile. The 1930 car was actually pale blue before getting 20 coats of yellow paint. YELLOW SUBMARINE (1968) -- In this psychedelic toon The Beatles proved that all you need is love -- and a banana-hued underwater vessel -- to tame the Blue Meanies. The Fab Four also found time to sing such classics as ""Eleanor Rigby"" and the title song. THE SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS MOVIE (2004) -- If nautical nonsense be something you wish then this flick starring the most popular yellow sponge in cartoon history is for you. In February SpongeBob made a splash with his second movie ""Sponge Out of Water.""

Meet some of their past idols including Scarlet Overkill voiced by Sandra Bullock. USA TODAYScarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) hires Stuart Kevin and Bob as her new henchmen in Minions.(Photo Illumination Entertainment)Watching the banana-loving goggle-clad yellow dudes of Minions move and groove through history making ""friends"" with dinosaurs Dracula and Napoleon along the way is an altogether charming sight.There can be too much of a goofily good thing though especially when it comes to this little army of oddballs from the Despicable Me movies.Their big-screen spinoff (  1/2 out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) captures some of the heartwarming nature that made the two previous films special. But too often Minions settles for juvenile humor along the lines of fart jokes and one of the animated stars running around in thong underwear. Plus the Looney Tunes-style violence is mean-spirited at times for a franchise centered on adorable weirdos.USA TODAYMinions malevolent new additionsDirected by Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin the film follows the Minions evolution from single-celled organisms to babbling folks whose only goal is to be worker bees for the most reprehensible supervillain they can find.In Despicable Me thats the lovable Gru (Steve Carell) the ace baddie with some real soul. But this is a prequel so the story settles in 1968 when a trio of Minions -- industrious Kevin one-eyed guitar-playing Stuart and pint-sized Bob (all voiced by Coffin) -- venture from their icy headquarters to seek out their next great boss.The Twinkie-resembling threesome finds her at Villain-Con Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) is pretty much the evilest of them all and she hires her new henchmen in overalls to steal Queen Elizabeths crown so she can rule England. The femme fatales plan is thwarted when Bob bumbles into power and she decides to lay them off rather permanently.USA TODAYFive ways Minions proved world domination at their Hollywood premiereBrian Lynchs screenplay features a series of amusing sight gags and physical comedy that mostly hits; watching the Minions play polo while riding Corgis is an exercise in cuteness. Their indecipherable vocabulary is a mixture of French Italian Spanish and pure gibberish but you manage to get the gist all the same. Also impressive is how much facial expression they have even though their animated features are mainly big googly eyes and a small mouth.Bullock is just so-so and short on the right amount of megalomania for Scarlet; Jon Hamm makes up for it going over the top voicing her kooky inventor husband Herb. Jennifer Saunders is absolutely fabulous as the surprisingly tough Queen and Allison Janney and Michael Keaton are entertaining as a suburban Bonnie and Clyde with criminal kids in tow.A soundtrack featuring The Turtles The Kinks and The Who seems out of tune for a kids movie -- perhaps its to keep the parents and grandparents entertained. Still Stuart wailing in 68 on the guitar solo from Van Halens Eruption from 78 is a bit of a blip in the space-time continuum.USA TODAYSandra Bullock rocks outrageous Minion heels confesses shes a MinionLike Boba Fett in the Star Wars franchise the beauty of the Minions in the Despicable Me films is a certain mystery thats there with them as cool supporting characters. Watching them nonstop for 90 minutes scrapes off that novelty and more than likely ensures they reach the nadir of their pop-culture saturation. If not everybodys getting Minion thongs for Christmas.In their defense though even the umpteenth time they excitedly say ""BA-NA-NAAA"" or ""Mind the gap"" -- with the help of a fan-favorite cameo -- the little guys still smack of that old Despicable magic. 200 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1Mijuq9",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/07/09/minions-movie-review/29856285/,200,minions13,minions,usatoday

If youre old enough to read a movie review in a newspaper youre too old to fully appreciate ""Minions."" Ditto if youre old enough to read the menu at a fast-food joint the height requirements at an amusement park or the price tag on a shiny yellow toy. This spinoff of the ""Despicable Me"" cartoons is like a pre-verbal version of ""Inside Out"" all coos and colors and cute facial expressions. Tiny tots will eat it up like jelly beans.But what about their bigger siblings and baby-sitters? Will they be trapped on a sugar-rush cycle with no hope of escape?Yes but ... The mad scientists at Universal have scrubbed this toon of anything that might scare or challenge the target audience. Although we learn in a narrated intro that the little yellow minions are a prehistoric species that has served evil masters from T. rex to Napoleon Bonaparte theres barely a hint of actual evil in the entire film.Circa 1968 minions Kevin Bob and Stuart leave their tribe of goggle-eyed peanut-shaped peers in Antarctica and travel the world in search of a new master. Their trek takes them from groovy New York to humid Orlando (home of the Villain Con convention) to swingin London where super-villainess Scarlet Overkill (voice of Sandra Bullock) with the help of her gadgeteer husband (voice of Jon Hamm) has her sights set on the crown jewels of England. A woman who wants fancy jewelry? Were not exactly talking Adolf Hitler-level villainy. Along with plot and peril other missing ingredients include character and dialogue. The three minions are very hard to differentiate (granted one of them has a single eye) and they all speak in the same nonsensical chattering mashup of Spanish Esperanto and Elvish.""Minions"" is product pure and simple. Little kids will love it but grown-ups will feel like theyre being held hostage in a Fisher-Price test laboratory.What ""Minions""  Two stars out of four  Run time 131  Rating PG  Content Action and rude humor Joe Williams  314-340-8344Film criticjoethecritic on Twitterjoewilliamspost-dispatch.com Tags Minions Despicable Me Sandra Bullock Jon Hamm Joe Williams Joe Williams is the film critic for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

Nonetheless ""Minions"" is a disappointingly meh effort from Illumination Entertainment even if you would never hold the upstart animation studio to Pixar standards.For anyone who hasnt seen the trailer (and really the rest of the movie is just padding) ""Minions"" is about an ancient tribe of yellow freaks of nature whose only purpose is to serve the biggest baddest villain around. Jabbering on in a sort of pidgin Esperanto they basically look like plastic bath toys in the shape of bacteria with tiny arms and big eyes -- sometimes two sometimes one.RELATED Meet Minions supervillain Scarlet OverkillHowever they are as incompetent as they are cute which is bad news for a string of would-be bosses ranging from Tyrannosaurus rex to Napoleon Bonaparte. Finally after millennia of failure the stalwart Kevin the overeager Bob and the soulful Stuart set out on a quest to find their once and future master in 1968 America and an underground gathering of wannabe baddies called Villain Con.Before the minions met Gru they worked for Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock). (Photo Universal Pictures)Sandra Bullock provides the voice of Scarlett Overkill who dreams of being queen of England and ""Mad Mens"" Jon Hamm plays her smarmy hubby a gadgets genius who outfits the Minions better than Q ever did James Bond. Other voices include Alison Janney as a gun-toting housewife and Geoffrey Rush providing drolly highbrow narration.The story and characters are perfunctory really just an excuse for this movies parade of sight gags which include dance breaks to such period hits as ""Hair"" and the theme song from ""The Monkees."" It is mildly amusing to play Spot the Pop Culture References -- which include a brief appearance by the Beatles in the Abbey Road crosswalk -- but despite the dizzying pace of carefully calibrated incongruities ""Minions"" somehow never generates more than the occasional chuckle.Even the Minions themselves arent as endearing as they are in the previous movies maybe because there are fewer of them bumbling around or maybe because they just havent found their true supervillain love yet.Or maybe some sidekicks no matter how loveable just arent cartoon-hero material.Reach the reviewer at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.Minions 1/2Directors Kyle Balda Pierre Coffin.Cast Voices of Sandra Bullock Jon Hamm Michael Keaton Geoffrey Rush.Rating PG for action and rude humor.Great  Good Fair  Bad  Bomb  10 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1Midqy3 More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it ""Minions"" shows how Kevin Bob and Stuart (all voiced by co-director Pierre Coffin) got into their line of work in a prequel to the ""Despicable Me"" movies. (Illumination Entertainment/Universal Pictures) By Michael OSullivan July 9 2015 It was inevitable that the Minions would get their own full-length movie. These strange cartoon creatures -- overall-clad yellow munchkins resembling googly-eyed amoxicillin capsules -- stole the spotlight from Steve Carells Gru in both ""Despicable Me"" movies. And the raft of Minion-themed shorts that followed along with the requisite video game was still not enough to satisfy the clangorous demand of their prepubescent fans. Many of those fans were on hand at the local press screening of ""Minions"" giving audible evidence of their devotion by chanting ""Minions Minions Minions"" when the start time was delayed by more than 30 minutes (which pushed the closing credits well past their bedtimes). [Minions have taken over the world and my kid] I am not sure that I can even remember such youthful passion. But then neither can my 15-year-old son who is long past caring about the Minion origin story which is the subject of the current -- and no doubt polarizing -- prequel. Although ""Minions"" will probably delight small children the story of how the title characters came to be henchmen for the supervillain Gru may well drive their parents insane despite being set in the 1960s and boasting a classic-rock soundtrack featuring the Kinks the Beatles and the Who. Music to your ears? Sure mine too. Its just that 90 minutes of listening to the ""dialogue"" of Minions -- who jabber in a helium-pitched blend of pidgin French Spanish and Italian sprinkled with a smattering of Jar Jar Binks-isms and the occasional ""yakitori"" or ""pachinko"" -- is not my idea of fun. I too once enjoyed the Minions in the small doses that they came in. But the extra-strength ""Minions"" is for better or for worse too much of a good thing. [The 2015 Summer Movie Guide Minions and so much more] The movie opens with a charming 2-D animation of the Minion races evolution from single-celled organisms to the roly-poly lackeys that they eventually become a 3-D CGI horde of cheerful if clownishly inept beings destined by DNA to seek the employ of the worlds worst characters. This prologue shows them working over the centuries for such baddies as Dracula and the Abominable Snowman before receiving word of a convention of evildoers in 1960s Florida. Three of the apparently ageless Minions -- Kevin Bob and Stuart all voiced by co-director Pierre Coffin -- travel from Antarctica to Orlando where theyre hired by arch-villain Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) to steal the Queen of Englands crown. Hijinks and shenanigans ensue. And by ""ensue"" I mean come at you like a freight train. ""Minions"" by and large derives its laughs from the kind of comedy that kids love -- e.g. characters falling down or having things fall on them -- but it lacks the subversive self-referential physical wit of a classic Tex Avery cartoon. Its lowest-common-denominator slapstick and plenty of it the theory being that if something works more of it is always better. Jon Hamm turns in an amusing performance as Scarlets husband Herb a shaggy heavily sideburned hipster who is in charge of gadgets and weaponry (which deliver most of the films modestly clever sight gags as they did in the ""Despicable Me"" movies). But ""Minions"" is neither for nor about grown-ups like him who are old enough to shave. It belongs to the Minions and their legions of still fresh-faced fans. PG. At area theaters. Contains slapstick violence and mild rude humor. 91 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

A spin-off of the ""Despicable Me"" movies in which the little yellow fellows were the villains henchmen ""Minions"" is a pointless frenetic exercise with tired jokes and weak sequences piled one on top of another until feature length is finally reached and everybody can go home. When you look at the ambition imagination and emotional range of a Pixar effort like ""Inside Out"" ""Minions"" looks like a visit to animations bad old days. Watching it is like watching the product of some hellish game of free association in which various people came up with ideas and no one was allowed to say ""But wait thats lousy."" All art is in a sense a give and take between impulse and control but ""Minions"" is all impulses mostly bad ones. Its not funny. Its not not funny. Its more like a mess. At one point one of the minions is crowned king of England (dont ask) and must make a speech. He says his name ""King Bob"" and the crowd cheers. Then he starts talking and the audience is confused because minions dont speak English. After a few moments sensing he is losing his audience he concludes by saying ""King Bob"" again and the audience cheers again. Thats supposed to be hilarious. Odd musical choices A moment later the Whos ""My Generation"" is blaring over the soundtrack for no reason at all except that the movie happens to be set in London in 1968. There are odd musical references throughout ""Minions"" and the impression that comes through is that audiences are supposed to derive pleasure from them for no reason but that theyre unexpected. For example the minions break into a gibberish version of ""Make Em Laugh"" from ""Singin in the Rain."" The Boxtops song ""The Letter"" and the Kinks ""You Really Got Me"" underscore respective scenes which are animated slapstick and have nothing to do with the music. A narrated sequence at the start tells us who the minions are -- yellow creatures whose entire mission in life is to serve an evil master. The gimmick a potentially funny one is that theyre so incompetent that they inevitably end up undermining their masters by accident -- such as waking up Dracula in the afternoon. Fine. Cute idea. But ""Minions"" is so poorly conceived that despite that setup (unnecessary as it turns out) nothing like that happens in the movie. To talk about the story of ""Minions"" is to make the movie seem more linear than it is. Basically its about three of these little creatures who go into the world looking for someone evil to serve. At a villains convention they meet Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) who fancies herself the most evil woman in the world. She sends the minions on a mission to steal the crown jewels from Queen Elizabeth II and the adventures go on from there. ""Minions"" has the same problem as ""Despicable Me"" only worse. The protagonists are ciphers and their goal is unworthy and of little interest. The bottom line is that the filmmakers are working with nothing here -- no characters to speak of no interpersonal relationships no story with any suspense or capacity to engage and no script with any humor or wit. What can they do? They do two things. The first is that they create lots of commotion that they hope might be confused for forward motion. Someone is always chasing someone. Bozo the Clown at one point is chasing the minions as he juggles old-fashioned anarchist bombs. Who knew that Bozo went over to the dark side? The second thing is they get one or two incidental things right little things that dont really matter except theyre a slight diversion if you happen to get stuck in this movie and cant find the exit. The animators rendering of the British people is clever as in the drawing of various types you might see in the London Underground. 2-D if any Incidentally the 3-D glasses make the picture dark and murky and 3-D adds nothing. Those who insist on seeing it should probably see it in two dimensions though for this one zero dimensions is the best bet. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In the current crop of follow-up films brought back to the screen by popular demand few will delight 7-year-olds like ""Minions."" The appeal of these deferential little yellow creatures looking like Twinkies cross-bred with gelatin pill capsules helped push the ""Despicable Me"" franchise to an unprecedented level of adorableness. And a worldwide box-office take beyond a billion dollars. What makes them a phenomenon with grade-schoolers? I think its the infantilized sense of humor babbling Euro-gibberish and portraits of most adults as pushy supervisors like the first two films evil villain Gru. Its funny because its true Pierre Coffin the co-director of the earlier installments returns to the helm (this time partnering with Kyle Balda who did the four-minute Minions short ""Banana"" in 2010). Here we begin before the beginning as a flashback under the opening credits shows us how single-celled larvae over millions of years evolved into land-dwelling creatures of impish idiocy. Geoffrey Rush narrates the prologue demonstrating how the ever-obedient Minions were programmed to find the most wicked master to serve. They progress quickly from a T. rex to an Egyptian pharaoh Dracula and Napoleon each of whom they accidentally erase before scuttling off to locate a successor. Rushs silver throat the cleverly designed action sequences and the choice to use the Turtles gem ""Happy Together"" to frame the throwaway gags quickly demonstrate the care brought to the films fundamental design. ""Minions"" is deliberately silly -- it makes Pixars intelligent ""Inside Out"" look like a TED Talk -- but it is never shoddy. Quickly scampering off to the safety of an Arctic cave the Minions fail to assist scoundrels from recent centuries (Stalin would have been awkward). They suffer a collective case of the blahs that stirs a Minion named Kevin to search for an atrocious new leader. Joining him on the quest are Stuart a bit of a young rebel and happy hapless Bob. It is 1968 by the time they arrive in the United States which the film recognizes as a high-water mark for pop music and ambitious villains. Why else would the first thing they see in New York City be a ""Nixon for President"" poster? The three follow an all-American family of robbers (the mom and dad nicely voiced by Allison Janney and Michael Keaton) to a Florida villains convention where they are recruited as servants of Scarlet Overkill (played with less oomph than one expects from Sandra Bullock). As the worlds first female supervillain she plans to steal Queen Elizabeths crown jewels in London. In case thats not clear a title notes that they have arrived at ""The Tower of London -- London."" Feed Loader ""Minions"" As you would expect the script -- there is one sort of -- feels as if it was written to fill the blanks in a Mad Libs story. Its here in the second half that the film wanders trying to squeeze laughs out of antique jokes about pubs bowler hats the queens costumed yeoman guards and swinging British rock. Its great to hear the Whos ""My Generation"" and the Kinks ""You Really Got Me"" but will any child understand the gag when the Minions pop up at Abbey Road and see four well-shod pedestrians march across the crosswalk? Hopefully the greatest-hits soundtrack and an opening that features a Minions chorus yodeling the Universal Studios fanfare will retire the worldwide kids obsession with songs from ""Frozen."" Coffin who provides much of the Minions endless chatter makes a rollicking joyride out of their oddball Esperanto where we encounter fractured Spanish ""mazel tov"" ""kumbaya"" and whenever they encounter their favorite fruit endless cheers of ""Banana"" The target demographic will undoubtedly go bananas too. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For decades sidekicks in mainstream animated movies had to make do with stealing scenes from their blander masters your princesses your princes your occasional heroic orphan. But as the major computer-animation providers search for ways to extend their brands theyve become willing to flout narrative convention and spin off whole movies starring the penguins from Madagascar or the Minions those diminutive pill-shaped yellow weirdos from the Despicable Me films. In the latter case the feature Minions goes so far as to retcon the beloved chatterboxes all the way back to the beginning of life on Earth.This makes less sense than their implied origin in Despicable Me as creations of aspiring supervillain Gru but showing the Minions crawling out of the ocean more or less fully formed (minus their trademark blue overalls acquired in the 20th century) does lead to some funny sequences of the little yellow folks bumbling their way through prehistory the dawn of man and into recorded history forever in search of the strongest supervillain to serve. Or more accurately this would lead to some funny sequences if Minions trusted its audience to understand the medium of animation. The Minions come from a long line of cartoon characters unencumbered by the English language and perfectly expressive without it. Yet their movie opens with plummy storybook narration explaining who the Minions are what they want and on and on suffocating what should be a fun gag reel. (With prolonged exposure the movie also loosens up their gibberish style of speaking--voiced per gibberish-talking sidekick tradition by director Pierre Coffin--slipping in plenty of English words among French and Spanish phrases.) Half the fun of this character style is the way animators can communicate so much through facial movements or expressive slapstick but Minions is too busy translating itself to appreciate its own potential craft.Maybe studio executives worried that the narrator was needed to immediately differentiate between the three Minions who strike out to find their tribe a new boss Kevin the industrious leader; Bob the childlike innocent; and Stuart the one who uh likes guitars. Their half-assed heros journey serves primarily to work around the vast yellow horde established by the previous films simplifying the main story down to a manageable trio on a mission and leaving the rest of the Minions off in the comic-relief margins. This decision also has the curious function of re-fashioning this prequel/spin-off into an ineffectual sort-of-remake of the original Despicable Me. Instead of three little girls softening up the quasi-evil Gru three cute little Minions stay relatively innocent by bumbling away from the actually evil Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock gamely miscast) who they meet while attending Villain-Con in 1968 Orlando (the pre-Disney state of which is amusingly depicted via an abandoned gas station in a swamp). Even more curious not much of this business is all that funny. Some amusing if fleeting gags pop up and when Bob accidentally gets crowned King Of England theres a taste of the comic anarchy these characters provided in the previous Despicable films. But by leaning so hard on the imagined Minion ethos of supervillain-worship the spin-off muddles its conception of both the characters and its comic definition of supervillainy which winds up looking more than ever like mischief chased with the occasional violent death. It doesnt clarify matters that despite all of the chatter about bosses and evildoing and villains most of the Minions appear more interested in training for a movie-ending dance party. Thankfully the film manages to avoid that particular animation trope though it does mount several impromptu Minion covers of popular songs with a 60s-heavy soundtrack. Regardless of muddled motivations the Minions are funnier as a collective than as individuals putting Kevin Bob and Stuart in the awkward position of having their movie stolen from them (however briefly) by some of their own. Theres far more joy in the way an anonymous Minion packs his mouth with cookies before fleeing a restaurant than in Kevins desire for acknowledgment of his leadership skills.The Euro-inflected animators try to liven up the formula by experimenting with different forms the limited-color retro advertisement for Villain-Con and a brief bedtime story animated in stop-motion style add more than the rest of the 60s setting (which otherwise means a few retro fashions and plenty of lazy anachronisms in the dialogue). But most of Minions proceeds with state-of-the-art computer animation both the reason it exists and maybe the reason its not as much fun as it should be. At its best big-studio computer animation opens up all manners of possibilities allowing the filmmakers to play around with goofy sight-gag weapons like a lava-lamp gun that fires real lava and a set of robot limbs that Bob acquires for the length of an action sequence. At worst though it amps up the purity of animated slapstick to blockbuster levels of bombast. Minions has idiosyncratic roots but its a franchise play all the way. Finally even 5-year-olds have their own movie that mechanically cashes in on something they loved when they were younger.

(Photo Credit Universal Pictures) Review The prequel to ""Despicable Me"" proves that chittery gibberish by itself can only carry a picture so far. Rating 2 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSpecial to The Seattle Times Two words mild chuckles. Two more words needs Gru. In the matter of ""Minions"" guffaws are few. Theres plenty in the picture to make you smile and every once in a while along comes a moment to make you roar. Toward the end theres a gag that takes the term ""parachute pants"" to an immense and intensely nutty extreme. Good times. Movie Review    Minions with the voices of Pierre Coffin Sandra Bullock Michael Keaton Jon Hamm Allison Janney. Directed by Coffin and Kyle Balda from a screenplay by Brian Lynch. 91 minutes.

A short distance to be exact which is in keeping with the sawed-off stature of the movies titular critters -- the Twinkie-shaped Twinkie-colored gibberish-spouting mischief makers who instantly endeared themselves to audiences in 2010s animated hit ""Despicable Me."" Their natural role is that of supporting characters comic relief. Their short selves are perfectly suited for cartoon shorts. But saddling them with the burden of carrying a whole movie on their nonexistent shoulders puts too much strain on the little dears. Left to their own devices as they are by directors Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda and writer Brian Lynch they clown and preen and (mis)behave in a manner that becomes increasingly precious as the movie wears on. Eventually their antics just become wearing. The picture is the prequel to ""Despicable Me"" taking place in the years -- millennia actually -- before they hooked up with the dastardly but undeniably delightful master villain Gru. How ""Minions"" misses the sardonic perversity (and bizarre Mittel-European accent) of the Steve Carell-voiced baddie The movie follows the tribe through prehistory and ancient history as they search for evildoers to serve. From T-rex to Pharaoh to Dracula none passes the test of minion leadership because minion bungling invariably results in these leaders quick demise. The bulk of the movie takes place in 1968 when three minions -- Kevin Stuart and Bob all gibbered by director Coffin -- fall under the villainous spell of Scarlet Overkill a wasp-waisted virago voiced by Sandra Bullock. Flying around in a red rocket-propelled dress she is a one-note caricature of bombastic bellowing badness. All other characters are similarly unidimensional. Scarlets evil scheme is to have the minions steal Queen Elizabeths crown which provides the opportunity for sight gags involving corgis minion-hued bearskin hats and Tower of London torture devices. All gags are frantically paced. The 60s setting gives the filmmakers the opportunity to fill the soundtrack with 60s hits from the likes of the Beatles the Who the Kinks and Hendrix that dont have much connection to the action on the screen. Young kids are the target audience for this one and the bright colors and goofiness will keep them entertained. Adults of a certain age might just find themselves wanting to run out and buy the soundtrack album.

Scarlet Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) is a super-villain in ""Minions."" BY Jacob Hall NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday July 8 2015 527 PM Title MINIONS Film Info With the voices of Sandra Bullock Jon Hamm Michael Keaton Animated origins of the henchmen from ""Despicable Me."" Directors Pierre Coffin Kyle Balda (131) PG. Area theaters. INTRODUCED IN ""Despicable Me"" in 2010 those yellow pill-shaped gibberish-speaking ""Minions"" now have their own spinoff -- and they still ride a fine line between irritating and adorable. The Minions really are cute for about 20 minutes before they begin to get repetitive. Theres a reason Looney Tunes cartoons were a few minutes long. You can only take so much slapstick wackiness before it starts to get old. Parents Steel yourselves for farts and incomprehensible gobbledygook. A plot summary may make this a bit clearer -- though no more reasonable. Apparently Gru the anti-hero from the first two films did not invent the Minions to do his bidding. The Minions were told existed in prehistoric times where they helped dinosaurs and cavemen -- the first of a series of baddies and villains they serve throughout history. All of their masters eventually die but at least the Minions try to do the bidding correctly. Then in 1968 a trio of Minions -- Kevin Stuart and Bob all voiced squeakily by co-director Pierre Coffin -- is recruited by a villainess Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock). She needs help with a plot to steal the British crown jewels. Hijinks of the cute and surprisingly immoral ensue set to predictable British Invasion tunes. Parents in the audience will undoubtedly appreciate the period-appropriate soundtrack but it plays as the most generic ""Hits of the 60s"" mix tape imaginable. The song choices reflect the movie itself at best safe and charming. Since the Minions themselves are barely characters much of the film falls on the shoulders of Bullock. She isnt up to the challenge. Americas favorite girl next door is woefully miscast as an unhinged sexpot super-villain. Lines that surely read as hilarious on the page fall flat with her delivery. This is the nadir of celebrity voice casting; just because you can cast a famous voice doesnt mean that you should. Jon Hamm fares far better as Scarlets sleazy gadget genius of a husband. But the human characters are a mere distraction. Kevin Stuart and Bob are the real stars of the show. When theyre at their best they recall early silent comedians. They may not speak an intelligible language but the audience is never at a loss as to what theyre saying. You always know exactly why theyre running and tripping. Its often genuinely impressive. The movie peaks early. A trip to ""Villain-Con"" a pointed riff on San Diegos infamous Comic-Con opens up the Despicable Me universe in a big way. We get a glimpse at hundreds of colorful evildoers each of them with a unique personality. Michael Keaton steals the show as the patriarch of a bank-robbing family. Directors Kyle Balda and Coffin avoid some monotony by surrounding the Minions with colorful support. Indeed the movie is all the better for its diversions. Your tolerance for ""Minions"" begins and ends with the Minions themselves. Their shrill language and endless pratfalls will work only for kids while some parents will find ""Minions"" 91 minutes of yellow-tinged hell -- and a reason to steer the tots back to ""Inside Out"" for a second or third viewing.

Photo Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment MOVIE REVIEW Minions Running time 88 minutes. Rated PG (mild crude humor). By far the highlight of ""Minions"" is hearing The Beatles ""Got To Get You Into My Life"" over the closing credits -- the first time I think Ive ever heard it used in a movie. Otherwise the prequel to ""Despicable Me"" is like trying to form a rock band out of three Ringos. Given the cleverness of the two ""Despicable"" movies the ineptitude of ""Minions"" comes as an astonishment. You can sense the studio chiefs saying ""Animators We must have the best. Actors Give us Oscar and Emmy winners. Soundtrack More classic rock than Forrest Gump. Script? We dont have any money left. Find that guy who wrote the movie where Russell Brand played the Easter Bunny"" Photo Universal Pictures and Illumination EntertainmentThe whole movie feels like filler the equivalent of taking the Scrat slapstick that begins the ""Ice Age"" movies and stretching it to 90 minutes. First comes a prologue in which we observe the evolution of the pill-shaped yellow men how they became loyal servants to evildoers and how their bumbling led to disaster for everyone they served. Apparently they even cost Napoleon his victory though the story of how Minion tomfoolery incited the downfall of the Third Reich must await another movie. Things lurch forward a bit when the three leader Minions -- Kevin Stuart and Bob -- leave the group home in the Arctic and strike out for 1968 New York City where we learn the answers to such critical origin questions as where they got their overalls They found them hanging on a clothesline. Allison Janney (from left) Michael Beattie Michael Keaton and Katy Mixon voice a family of robbers in ""Minions.""Photo Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment Seeing an ad on TV for a villain convention in Orlando Fla. the Minions hitch a ride with a family that is heading there on vacation. They turn out to be a clan of bank robbers (Michael Keaton and Allison Janney are the parents) but theyre forgotten after a few madcap chases. The opportunity for Universal Pictures the maker of this film to poke fun at a competitor company associated with Orlando is however mysteriously squandered. Whats the point of moving the story to Orlando if youre not going to do Disney jokes? At least the main story finally kicks in Befriending new supervillain Scarlet (Sandra Bullock) the Ms head with her to England on a mission to steal Queen Elizabeths crown using wacky gadgets designed by Scarlets inventor husband (Jon Hamm doing the only amusing voice in the movie). The Minions stumble into not only capturing the crown but also Bob being appointed the new king. The Minions and Scarlet Overkill (far right) voiced by Sandra Bullock.Photo Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment Mostly the film is about the Minions getting in pratfalls speaking Minion-ese and generally being cute. Cute is enough if youre a Toys ""R"" Us display but this movie mangles the rudiments of storytelling. How does one character steal a ruby that cant be stolen? How do others survive a huge explosion? We dont know. Screenwriter Brian Lynch didnt bother to ask himself these questions. Even when he wanders into a potentially funny situation such as Queen Elizabeth being happier as a commoner who hangs out at the pub he doesnt develop it. Scarlet meanwhile doesnt compare to Gru that fascinating fiend from the earlier films whose mixture of arrogant genius and self-despising gloom is so quintessentially Russian. Shes just a boring egomaniac who zooms around irrelevantly in a rocket-fueled prom dress. If they made a movie about her -- which they wont unless Sominex needs a merchandising tie-in -- it would have to be ""Dispensable Me.""

"Review Minions is a silly gleeful treat - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Minions is a silly gleeful treatBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 07/08/2015 111917 AM PDTUpdated 07/08/2015 051316 PM PDT Hollywood is overrun with prequels gone wrong.From George Lucas frustratingly blah ""Star Wars Episode 1 -- The Phantom Menace"" to Ridley Scotts sleep-inducing ""Alien"" bummer ""Prometheus"" so-called origin films often fail to live up to or even approach the magic of the original.Of course there are notable exceptions. ""The Godfather Part II"" with its flashbacks to the early life of Vito Corleone remains an American classic and ""X-Men First Class"" stands out in the crowded superhero franchise universe.The unlikely ""Minions"" mostly gets the prequel thing right. The bouncy 3-D animated feature rolls out the red carpet for those hyperactive yellow jabbering pill-looking beings from ""Despicable Me"" and ""Despicable Me 2."" To everyones surprise the tiny mischief makers escape the prequel curse. (L-R) Bob Kevin and Stuart (voiced by Pierre Coffin) in Minions. (Universal Pictures) ( Universal Pictures ) How much you enjoy ""Minions"" depends on whether youre a fan of these simple-minded but innocent henchmen. Some adults especially parents might curse their here-there-everywhere existence while others find them endearing. Full confession I have a soft spot for the minions. Still I wondered whether these clueless creations that speak in a mash-up of languages could carry a film. The answer They can and do thanks to a team effort which includes a clever screenplay from Brian Lynch (""Puss in Boots"") energetic animation mostly smooth direction from Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda and a fun vocal cast.The story speeds along at a fast clip opening with fine voice-over narration from Geoffrey Rush who puts us in nostalgic mind of the masterful work done by Boris Karloff for Dr. Seuss ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" TV special.Advertisement Rush makes a fine National Geographic-like navigator chronicling the history of the minions -- from the prehistoric age to the 1960s when the bulk of this film takes place. Its a clever opening as the minions bungle up serving their baddies who range from a T. rex to Dracula.They wind up depressed and stuck in the Antarctic without a villain to follow. Three intrepid members -- Bob Stuart and Kevin (the brainiest of the bunch) -- strike out to find a new villain to work for. (This all happens prior to the Gru days from the ""Despicable Me"" movies.) (L-R) Stuart Bob and Kevin (voiced by Pierre Coffin) and the worlds first ever super villain Scarlett Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) in Minions. (Universal Pictures) ( Universal Pictures ) They ultimately arrive in Orlando Florida for an underground villains convention where their inept shenanigans lead to them winning a contest and becoming henchmen for the dastardly Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) who brings them to London.Scarlet has big plans. She and her husband Herb (Jon Hamm) want to steal the Queens crown but those plans go awry thanks to her new sidekicks.The plot gets loopier as it progresses and while not all the jokes work a majority of them do. And what really stand out are the little details. Case in point The minions at one point hitch a ride with a family of bank robbers and during a heist even the quirky family cat dons a mask. The film is stuffed with random enjoyable bits like that. Even the Beatles in animated form make a silly appearance.The voice cast gets into the loony spirit of it all. Bullock has fun playing against type. Allison Janney and Michael Keaton are hilarious as Orlando-bound villains. But it is Hamm (""Mad Men"") who gives the best vocal performance and emerges as the most fully realized character as the less-savvy counterpart to his wife. While ""Minions"" isnt in the same writing and animation league as what Pixar produces it is a fun cheerful time-passer thats filled with many random zingers that will leave you snickering afterward. That image of the robber cat fleeting as it was still cracks me up.Minions    Rating PG (for action and rude humor)Cast Sandra Bullock Jon Hamm Michael Keaton Allison Janney Geoffrey RushDirectors Pierre Coffin and Kyle BaldaRunning time 1 hour 44 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Universal Pictures Universal Pictures Minions    (out of five) Directors Pierre Coffin Kyle Balda Cast Sandra Bullock Jon Hamm Michael Keaton Allison Janney Rated PG (action rude humor) Running time 91 min. By Maricar Estrellamestrellamom2momdfw.comPosted 1135am on Thursday Jul. 09 2015 Thursday Jul. 09 2015 Friday Jul. 10 2015 By Maricar Estrella Whenever there are scene-stealers in a film there seems to always be chatter about possible spin-offs. Minions is the latest attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the diminutive deviled-egg henchmen brought to life in the "" Despicable Me"" films. In the 2010 and 2013 movies the sidekicks played off their dastardly-yet-well-meaning boss Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) and made sitting through the credits high-level humorous artistry.In the animated Minions were given a prequel of sorts a back story to how the pill-shaped tribe came to be. Narrated by Geoffrey Rush the film begins with a historic time line of how the single-celled yellow organisms evolved and their failed attempts to serve despicable masters -- from T. rex to Napoleon. Without a master the Minions fall into a deep depression which prompts ambitious Kevin to lead a crew out of their Antarctic cave to find a new evil boss. He chooses guitar-loving Stuart and (begrudgingly) lovable shortcake Bob.The trios journey leads them to New York City in 1968. Along the way they meet a bad-loving family headed by Walter ( Michael Keaton) and Madge Nelson ( Allison Janney). They head to Orlando for a villain convention to find the ultimate super-villain master -- Scarlet Overkill ( Sandra Bullock). With the Minions help and the groovy gadgets hatched by her husband Herb ( Jon Hamm) Scarlet is convinced her dastardly scheme to rule the world will work. Director Pierre Coffin does double-duty as the gibberish-Spanglish voice of the Minions and visually pulls off a 3-D gem. The film has all of the elements and star power to be a blockbuster bonanza; however the screenplay lacks the emotional depth and comedic prowess of the previous films. Parts of the story are quite dark and unnecessarily gruesome for younger audiences. Even a bedtime story is turned into a humorless plot point. In fact the only laugh-out-loud bit comes in the very last scene thanks to Stuart. In the end the final credits are just a reminder of what weve grown to love about the mellow yellow crew. Unfortunately its too little too late. Maricar Estrella 817-390-7720 Twitter maricare Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Small characters amusing in smaller doses here they have to carry the whole tale by themselves - not an easy job. And as hard as the directors and animators try loading the film with pop songs and chases the filmmakers cant quite come up with what the last two movies had. Mostly an interestingly evil lead character and a clearcut and emotional conflict. The new movie has a back-to-the-beginning flashback that follows the apparently ageless minions back to their start as protozoa. All theyve ever wanted it seems is a nasty villain to serve. Theyll get one of course in Gru eventually but this movie takes place mostly in 1968 London where three of the little yellow guys have landed an apprenticeship with the villainess Scarlett Overkill. And soon proceed to prove themselves more halfwits than henchmen as they accidentally foil her evil plans - and turn themselves into her new terrible targets. One of the great things about the previous films was that in a world of Pixar copycats they had their own distinctive look all sharp cones and blunt tubes and comfortable circles. An ear for music too - the inescapable hit ""Happy"" had its first movie-screen exposure in ""Despicable Me 2."" The look has been maintained but the filmmakers have given up when it comes to music settling for a just-drop-the-needle collection of 60s hits (most of them chosen it seems to serve oldies nostalgia than match the action onscreen.) And the characters arent involving. The three main Minions are mostly interchangeable; an Abominable Snowman character feels like a steal from ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."" And worst of all Scarlett Overkill who needs to be as wildly colorful as her name is given a one-note vocal performance by Sandra Bullock. The animation is still fresh and unusual and the Minions themselves - who speak in a not-quite-incomprehensible mix of gibberish and a handful of Romance languages -- are fun. And admitted the film got some laughs from the youngest members of the preview audience - mostly when the film stooped to doing a bathroom gag or showed some naked Minion butt. (Desperate measures that the Pixar movies never stoop to by the way.) But why shell out money to see this in the theater when you can just buy a DVD next year? Or more to the point buy the plush toys that something like this is really all about. Ratings note The film contains some mildly vulgar humor and cartoon violence. Minions (PG) Universal (91 min.) Directed by Kyle Balda Pierre Coffin. With the voices of Sandra Bullock Allison Janney Geoffrey Rush Coffin. Opens Friday in New Jersey.   Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com.

Universal Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Hollywood lives by the simple sad axiom ""Where theres money theres more money"" which is how we get remakes of movies that sometimes shouldnt have been made in the first place two Spider-Man reboots within five years and a Star Wars franchise that ensures our childrens children will revere George Lucas just as some of us revere Orson Welles. Its also the reason the Minions -- those tiny noisily charismatic henchmen of the Despicable Me pictures -- get their own movie. On the plus side that movie boasts the elegantly spare title Minions which suits these pint-sized hellions in all their Rogaine-haired googly-eyed minimalist majesty. But should these peripatetic cold capsules brimming with mischief/mayhem be expected to carry a star vehicle on their collective overall-wearing shoulders? Is that a burden too great even for the Minions mighty as they are to bear?The Minions used to go about their business not caring whether we watched.Film Details Minions RatingPG GenreAnimation Running Time91 min. More Info Trailer Sadly the answer is ""banana."" Which in Minionspeak can mean a lot of things but in plain English means simply that our little friends arent quite up to the task. Thats no fault of the Minions themselves true pros who clearly give their all. It may not even be fully the fault of director Pierre Coffin who with Chris Renaud also directed the brilliantly disreputable 2010 caper that started it all as well as its almost-as-enjoyable 2013 sequel. But something is off in Minions which Coffin co-directed with Kyle Balda. (The screenwriter is Brian Lynch new to the franchise.) This is an origin story explaining how the naughty but dutiful Minions were for centuries a dejected displaced people Since the beginning of time -- or at least since the days when dinosaurs roamed the Earth -- theyve been searching for just the right villain to serve with little to no success. They worked with Dracula for a while before inadvertently frying him. Napoleon turned out to be a bad fit too -- youre a total loser if you still have a Napoleon complex when youve got the Minions to push around.Even after attempting to build their own civilization the Minions with no one truly evil to lead them became sad. So three stalwart Minions Kevin Bob and Stuart (all voiced by Coffin) leave the kingdom in search of a proper supervillain to latch onto. Their quest eventually takes them to London in 1968 where they become enchanted with Scarlett Overkill (Sandra Bullock) a bouffant-haired baddie in a poufy red strapless dress that nobody cool would have actually worn in 1968 London. (Luckily her not-quite-as-evil husband Herb voiced by Jon Hamm makes up for that sartorial faux pas with his lanky pinstriped suit and Ray Davies haircut.) Flattered by the Minion trios attentions Scarlett gives them an assignment to steal the Queen of Englands crown so that our villainess may fulfill her childhood dream of wearing it.Chattering and nattering Kevin Bob and Stuart make an unholy mess of the whole thing Bob screws up and becomes king himself; Stuart repeats the word ""banana"" so often that it ceases to become adorable; and Kevin the leader rushes around on little legs doing Minionesque things.Its all perfectly OK and even at times delightful Minions is dotted with clever sight gags including a scene of early Minions scampering about on prehistoric Earth wearing little fig leaves -- covering what exactly? Your guess is as good as mine. Later at Buckingham Palace one rides a corgi as if it were a chubby horse. At one point the trio tries to pass for human by standing atop one anothers shoulders and topping the whole wobbly stack with a trench coat in a possible homage to an old Little Rascals routine. Surely the Minions must know the Little Rascals backwards and forwards. But even if they dont the moment that coat opens at chest level and two Minion eyes peer out flashing like high beams is inspired.Yet Minions doesnt add up to all that it should. It tries mightily to replicate the retro-cool look of the earlier movies but the grooviness here feels a little forced with pop references from Bewitched to Andy Warhols tomato soup cans wedged in tight. The biggest problem may be that Scarlett Overkill makes an uninspiring villain. As world-class meanies go shes shrieky and demanding but has nothing on Despicable Mes ignobly alluring Gru (Steve Carell) who makes an appearance as his younger self just as the end credits are about to roll In his Euro turtleneck and drainpipe trousers and with his phony-baloney Russian accent Gru is still a marvel of so-bad-hes-good character design that cant be trumped.Theres something else too Minions as rambunctiously enchanting as they are are probably best scattered in the margins of a movie like loopy wayward doodles. They lose some of their magic when theyre front and center onscreen almost every minute. Minions isnt a disaster; its probably just too much of a potentially good thing. The Despicable Me pictures instead of trying to return adults to a false state of innocence reminded us that we all started out as ill-mannered little savages. The Minions eager to serve their crabby master as he plotted evil deeds like stealing the moon were the jittery embodiment of that idea a population of excitable shrimps with energy to burn. They went about their business without caring whether we were looking or not. Now they care desperately and desperation doesnt suit them. The Minions are now putting on a performance just for us like kids acting out. They make us feel like responsible parents enduring their antics until were forced to say something sensible like ""You kids pipe down"" or ""Thats it -- no more Trix for you"" Theyre killjoys of the highest order. Still pretty cute though.Directed by Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda. Written by Brian Lynch.

That might have inhibited the Despicable Me franchisees from devoting a whole feature to the warbling munchkin army known as Minions. At least it should have. As cuddly as the yellow rubber guys admittedly are bobbing loyally beside Despicables Gru (Steve Carell) or singing in their own four-minute short videos the gang simply cant sustain an hour and a half on their own. The buoyant opening sequence of Minions only buttresses that point showing their historic attempts to be slaves for evildoers from a T. Rex to Napoleon. Its an imaginative burst but then the noisome plot kicks in finding three Minions in New York City 1968. A campaign billboard for Richard Nixon teases a more subversive comedy about power worshipping and pack mentality--why else set the action in that era?--but it never materializes. Instead our chirpy pals are double-crossed by a supervillain named Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) whos basically Cruella de Vil with grenade launchers. Directors Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda provide the submental Spanglish voices of the Minions which are calibrated to tickle out maximum giggles from the films toddler audience. Not from their parents. If Minions were a toy youd hide its batteries.

""Minions"" the new movie tests the notion that what audiences enjoyed as a side dish can satisfy as an entree; I dont know if the movie picks up as it goes along or if it merely beat me into submission but after an initially slack 20 minutes or so I did finally start laughing. It helps that once the story moves into a world we recognize (albeit the world of 1968) screenwriter Brian Lynch (""Hop"") and directors Kyle Balda (""The Lorax"") and Pierre Coffin (""Despicable Me"") can riff on wonderfully absurd gags about everything from time travel to killer clowns to the musical ""Hair."" See Video Sandra Bullock Makes World Domination Look Adorable in New Minions Trailer (Video) Narrator Geoffrey Rush tells us that minions have existed since the dawn of life on this planet -- yep this is an origin story -- following at first unicellular alphas and then larger and larger apex predators providing their evil overlords with adoration and support before eventually doing something klutzy that destroys their superior. From dinosaurs to Dracula to Napoleon the minions tail their nasty bosses until the French army gives chase and they hide out in a cave until 1968. (Its also a handy way to explain that the minions were nowhere near Germany during the 1930s.) Decades of self-imposed exile leave them dispirited until Kevin the taller one decides to explore the world to find a new Big Bad for the minions to follow; the only volunteers to join him are guitar-playing one-eyed Stuart and bouncy young Bob. (All the minions are voiced by Coffin.) They arrive in New York where theyre enchanted by tie-dye and TV -- strangely despite their ongoing obsessions with bananas none of them picks up a copy of The Velvet Undergrounds debut album -- and they tune into a secret bad-guy network promoting the upcoming Villain-Con in Orlando. Also Read Minions Tracking for 85 Million Opening at Box Office Hitching a ride south with a bank-robbing family (Mom and Dad are voiced by Allison Janney and Michael Keaton) the minions wind up going to work for international supervillain Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) who takes them to England where she and her husband Herb (Jon Hamm) are planning to steal the crown jewels from Queen Elizabeth II (Jennifer Saunders). If youre coming to ""Minions"" expecting much in the way of plot or even distinguishing characteristics among the title characters youre in the wrong movie. But if youre tickled by the idea of a London police-car chase where all the bobbies in the passenger side are pouring tea into China cups or an elaborate bit of physical comedy involving running from a bee on a chandelier thats being screwed and unscrewed (depending on the direction that people are running) you may find yourself succumbing to the silliness. See Photos Nicole Kidman Ava DuVernay Sandra Bullock Sparkle at Women in Film Crystal Lucy Awards (Photos) While the minions are certainly little yellow and different ""Minions"" has probably mined them for about as much comedy as they can provide as leading men. Theyll no doubt continue to find glory being the wind beneath some other villains wings but for now theyre reasonably competent at being in the spotlight. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Little yellow peachy-keen and essentially useless the Minions are part of an animated tradition stretching back to the brooms in Fantasia the Doozers in Fraggle Rock and the aliens in Toy Story. But can they carry an entire film? The answer - surprisingly pleasingly and resoundingly - is yes. Cut loose from the family-values slushiness of their parent franchise the Minions are free to indulge their basest weirdest most randomly hilarious instincts. The plot is simple and largely irrelevant. Set before Despicable Me in the heady summer of 1968 the film follows three Minions - bossy Kevin reluctant Stuart and toddler-on-a-sugar-jag Bob - as they search for a new evil master to serve. They fix upon Scarlett Overkill (voiced by Sandra Bullock) a female super-villain making waves in the global community of evil. The films weakest aspect is perhaps predictably its human side Scarlett is little more than a Cruella de Vil clone - though her feckless husband Herb (Jon Hamm) is louchely wonderful. And the geeky idea of a villainous subculture with its own icons and fan conventions feels a bit trite. But the action sequences are wild the jokes relentlessly dumb-but-smart and the sheer sense of anything-goes daftness - which reaches a pinnacle when Bob draws the sword from the stone and is crowned King of England to the disgruntlement of Her Actual Maj (Jennifer Saunders) - is glorious.

A good prequel to Despicable Me but thats only what the kids tell me...Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 9 2015EnekoStaff WriterFeaturedI didnt have anything more interesting to watch on the cinema this past weekend so I decided to give a go to the Minions film. I had already seen the trailer and it looked quite fun. But then I got to the cinema the lights went out and the film started. The Universal Studios clip starts but instead of hearing the usual orchestra playing the music the minions sing it all through. I was already rolling on the floor.The film itself is rather a collection of funny situations put together to build up a rather poor story but its not the story you really care about. The jokes are so funny you hardly have time to settle down before the next one comes.As a Spaniard who also understands quite a bit of Japanese having the Minions speak in a mixture of different languages that include the previous two helped me get some jokes that English only speaking people might not easily get (if you havent seen it ""la cucaracha"" means ""the cockroach"". Remember that when you hear it on the film and you might end up either insulted -if you are ultra-monarchist- or stunned -if youre not-).All in all the game was a great fun even though certain bits of the ending of the film couldve been done shorter.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJul 9 2015Alex BFeaturedThe film was exactly as expected - great fun. Lots of jokes for children and adults alike. My four year old loved it. As a big fan of Despicable Me 2 I was a bit concerned this might be a let down but it really wasnt. You dont have to have seen any of the other films to enjoy it and it is a brilliant prequel for Despicable Me. My only criticism was that towards the end it gets a bit slow but it did pick up again and we all left the cinema saying how much wed enjoyed it.

TWITTER Sandra Bullock voices the new villain in this Despicable Me prequel of sorts. The dungarees- and goggles-wearing yellow sidekicks from the two Despicable Me films are upgraded to leading-minion status in the appropriately titled Minions from directors Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda. After switching round the formula used in the previous films in which the Steve Carell-voiced villain was cast as the improbable lead this Swinging London-set prequel goes back to a more classically structured setup in which the bad guy -- or rather bad girl voiced by a workmanlike Sandra Bullock -- is the antagonist while the mostly mumbling heroes take center stage. Unfortunately this robs the film of much of what made its predecessors stand out with the story lacking a clear narrative and emotional throughline to connect all of the films set pieces. Read more New Minions Trailer Corgis Thongs Sexual Innuendo That said the films slapsticky gags are often amusing and this franchise which has turned out quality animated films on relatively small budgets (the first two were produced for under 78 million each) has built up a lot of audience goodwill with Despicable Me 2 making 970 million worldwide. This at least bodes well for this films opening weekend though longer-term prospects seem more uncertain. Minions premiered at Frances Annecy International Animated Film Festival and opens in several territories overseas before its U.S. bow on July 10. The film written by Brian Lynch stars the three minions seen auditioning during the end credits of Despicable Me 2 Kevin the leader of the gang; overeager and heterochromic Bob whos still a child (or at least shorter than the others and always in need of a toy or pet); and one-eyed Stuart who didnt exactly volunteer for the job but is taken along on Kevins expedition anyway. All three are voiced by Coffin who co-directed the first two films as well. Balda previously co-directed The Lorax together with Chris Renaud Coffins helming colleague on the first two Despicable films who here acts as an executive producer and also provides some of the voices. As narrator Geoffrey Rush explains during the films busy opening sequence minions have been around for much longer than man eagerly serving baddies wherever they can find them. Past masters include a T. rex an evil pharaoh Dracula -- whose 357th birthday celebration thrown by the minions comes to a predictably disastrous end when they throw open the curtains during the day -- and Napoleon. Read more Star Wars Minions to Lead Record Year for Toy Industry But since theyre in the habit of not doing things quite the way they should be done -- and wreaking amusing havoc in the process -- the minions end up exiled in Antarctica after Napoleons disastrous Russian campaign (how this is possible geographically is never explained). After living in a cave for a few centuries the minions become a severely depressed species -- until Kevin finally decides to venture out into the world again to look for a new villain to serve and he takes Bob and Stuart on a trip to 1968 New York where they -- until then dressed in sheepskins for warmth -- find their now-iconic denim dungarees in a throwaway moment that isnt quite as impactful as the film wants it to be. Early shenanigans of the minions -- whose high-pitched gibberish has taken on a more Latin slant here often sounding like a vague mix of Spanish Italian and French with the occasional English word thrown in -- include watching The Dating Game with the show amusingly featuring three male candidates also called Bob Kevin and Stuart. The next day the trio hitchhike to Orlando Fla. in a car with a seemingly all-American clan that turns out to be a family of bank robbers (the parents are voiced by Michael Keaton and the always-delicious Allison Janney both in glorified cameos more than actual supporting roles). It turns out they all are headed for Villain-Con a secret gathering of baddies where the ""worlds first female supervillain"" Scarlett Overkill (Bullock) puts on a show to find new henchmen. No points for guessing wholl get the job. The long list of characters and locations introduced in the first half-hour -- with the latter including Egypt Transylvania Russia the South Pole New York and Orlando -- already suggests how disjointed the film is on a purely narrative level with each scene seemingly conceived individually rather than as part of a whole film although as stand-alone items most of them have some charm and offer some chuckles. Particularly funny are a bedtime story animated to look like stop-motion in which the minions are cast as the Three Little Pigs; and a particularly unenthusiastic soccer game back in Antarctica that underlines how bored and depressed the minion populace really is. Speaking of depression it seems that the sole quest of Kevin and his buddies -- who finally end up in London for the remainder of the film thanks to Overkill and her husband Herb (Jon Hamm) who want to steal the crown of Queen Elizabeth (voiced with haughty perfection by Jennifer Saunders) -- doesnt amount to much more than trying to avoid having the entire minions species succumb to gloominess and despair at the South Pole. While certainly different from that hoary race-to-save-the-world cliche it is simultaneously a somewhat odd common goal to work toward in a film aimed at families -- including their youngest members. And as with in Despicable Me 2 especially theres a tendency to throw in some music whenever the rhythm seems to lag rather than to tinker with the actual story and characters the way one supposes Pixar keeps doing until it gets it right. Read more Despicable Me Sidekicks Take NYC in First Minions Trailer The first two features in the series which both were scripted by Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio at least had central relationships that evolved over the course of the film as Carells much-missed unsociable baddie Mr. Gru learned to become a father to three orphan girls (film one) or a potential romantic partner (part deux) with the fact that the villain was also the protagonist adding something fresh to otherwise-familiar character and plot developments. Whats missing in Lynchs screenplay is a similar kind of arc on which to peg all the individual sequences as the minions -- like the proper sidekicks they are -- never really learn or change always getting caught in variations of the same scenario. Add to that the fact that Overkill is a straightforward antagonist and it feels like this particular collection of scenes couldve just as well been 20 -- or 200 -- minutes long. (Incidentally one can only wonder how much more interesting the story wouldve been from Overkills point of view; as it is she just sort of drifts in and out of the story when needed.) Though the film doesnt go much beyond the usual visual chestnuts once in London -- with lots of tea-drinking scones-eating and people wearing bowler hats or decked out in hippie attire (this is the 60s after all) -- what is new is a kind of photo-realism in the cityscape backdrops which are much more detailed and realistic here than in previous outings. However there are no particular scenes in which the use of 3D adds much a la the roller-coaster and underwater car rides in the preceding films. Instead of the peppy hip-hop infused songs by Pharrell Williams the soundtrack here is filled with 1960s ditties including work by The Rolling Stones The Turtles The Doors The Kinks and Donovans ""Mellow Yellow"" which is just about the perfect description of this prequel of sorts.

A ""Despicable Me"" prequel that traces Grus comic-relief henchmen all the way back to the time when they were single-celled organisms ""Minions"" hilariously imagines centuries in which the little guys have sought to serve the greatest villain they could find but quickly settles into more conventional cartoon territory once they fix on a dastardly new master named Scarlet Overkill voiced by Sandra Bullock. Delivering more Minions but less heart than their two previous outings  (which earned 543 million and 970 million worldwide) this by-popular-demand detour proves that as boundless as the yellow creatures appeal may seem they work better as supporting characters than as the main attraction -- not that the Minions will be wearing out their welcome anytime soon. Theyre still the funniest cartoon characters in town hitting that silly sweet spot capable of delighting everyone from toddlers to Kim Jong-un bound to reach new international box office heights for Universals Illumination Entertainment.SEE MORE Annecy Film Festival When it comes to franchise adventure pics each successive installment is only as strong as its villain -- a notion ""Minions"" illustrates by introducing a new baddie who isnt nearly as good as Gru. But long before Scarlet Overkill makes her entrance directors Pierre Coffin (the French comedy genius who dreamt up the Minions in the first place) and Kyle Balda (a Pixar vet who co-helmed ""Dr. Seuss The Lorax"") win us over with a tightly compressed laugh-a-minute prologue designed to provide some much-needed backstory for these tiny yellow freaks of nature tracing the Minions evolution from prehistoric times. Given the Minions own linguistic limitations (though they babble constantly their speech comes across as 90% nonsense punctuated occasionally by words that sound familiar like ""banana"" and ""kumbaya"") Geoffrey Rush proves a welcome guide in the opening stretch supplying narration to explain the strange species hit-and-miss history. Clumsy foolish and helplessly herd-oriented the Minions are the ultimate beta personalities desiring nothing more than to serve the most despicable master they can find -- the more ferocious the better. Its no coincidence that one English word stands out amid their chatter ""boss."" But the Minions are better at finding a master than at keeping one and more often than not theyre directly responsible for their own unemployment whether that means bumping a T. rex into an open volcano or accidentally exposing Dracula to full daylight. As a direct result of the Minions unsolicited assistance their early bosses suffer an unusually high fatality rate whereas no Minions appear to have been harmed in the making of the film -- a missed opportunity if ever there was. The films sense of humor is already Mad-magazine macabre Just imagine the potential laughs in watching the lemming-like creatures trial-and-error process reduce their number by a few hundred or so. Establishing the Minions as expendable rather than virtually immortal might also have helped to set the stakes for the trio who serve as the films main characters. Instead even a nuclear blast doesnt seem to faze their cockroach-like resilience. After losing the battle of Waterloo for Napoleon the Minions are sent into exile where idea guy Kevin (slightly taller than the others which might allow room for an extra brain cell or two) hatches the plan to leave their icy cave and seek out a new master. At least thats what it sounds like hes proposing in his speech though one can never be too sure when Minions are talking (nearly all of their dialogue is performed by Coffin himself). Asking for volunteers Kevin enlists one-eyed ukulele-toting Stuart and easily distractible Bob an affable runt with different-colored irises. Together they leave their tribe and set out to find a villain ambitious enough to require a support crew. Though it might not feel like Illuminations most ambitious film to date ""Minions"" certainly covers the most ground featuring scenes in different eras and international cities. The trios first stop is New York washing ashore in Manhattan at the height of the hippie era (which explains why vintage pop tunes some of them sung by Minions have replaced the funky Pharrell Williams score heard in the ""Despicable Me"" movies). Finding the city severely lacking in evil masterminds they happen to tune a borrowed television to the top-secret Villain Network Channel just in time to catch a promotion for Intl. Villain Con in Orlando -- no doubt an ideal recruitment opportunity for potential bench creatures like themselves. (And why not? There are wacky confabs for every other special interest under the sun though this development suggests yet another path not taken had they instead gone to Comic-Con and hooked up with some cosplay fanboy merely pretending to be a villain.) Hitchhiking to Florida Kevin Stuart and Bob catch a ride with a family of bank robbers named the Nelsons (the father is voiced by Michael Keaton the mother by Allison Janney) getting a renewed taste for how great it feels to serve a human master. Turns out the Minions are constantly looking to upgrade so upon arrival they quickly ditch the Nelsons and go searching for the worst meanie they can find Scarlet Overkill. With her rocket-powered red dress and crazy plans to steal the Queen of Englands crown shes flashy and just the right degree deranged but theres something off about the chemistry between Scarlet and her newfound assistants. Already supported by Mod-scientist inventor Herb (Jon Hamm) Scarlets much too capable for starters whereas Gru (who shows up later in the story) really does benefit from the Minions help while they in turn drew a misfit-family satisfaction from the arrangement thats missing here. Anyone whos ever worked for a bad boss should appreciate the suffering Scarlet puts her underlings through and yet the filmmakers opt to use this wacky sado-maso dynamic more for suspense than humor building up to a gonzo action sequence involving a kaiju-sized Minion. Stronger on concept than story Brian Lynchs ""Minions"" script emphasizes scale over quantity cutting back to the cave where the rest of the gang are sitting idle at regular intervals rather than taking advantage of their numbers to generate more of the crowd-based comedy seen in the earlier films. Analyzing the result -- as opposed to merely sitting back and enjoying it as so many around the world are sure to do -- one quickly realizes what a crazy challenge the film must have been. Not only are its characters incapable of expressing themselves in plain English (though ""Wall-E"" demonstrated the relatively highbrow potential of that restriction) but their personalities are so ripe for exploiting that there must have been a million Minion ideas that Lynch and everyone involved simply werent able to incorporate into the film. Heres hoping the best of them find their way into ""Despicable Me 3"" due out summer 2017. Film Review MinionsReviewed at Annecy Animation Film Festival June 18 2015. MPAA Rating PG.

Heston says July 13 2015 at 1230 pm To be crass crude and rude and say something the Hollywoodites hate to hear said but know only too true dollars taken in trump anything said by these pimples on their tushy critics who will at times play politics in the criticism put out by the behest of their evil leaders. Reply Beth C. Pfohl says June 22 2015 at 1155 am Thank you for your critique. These silly little creatures are just adorable. Reviews good bad indifferent or otherwise wont deter me from enjoying them once again. Reply Laurent V says June 19 2015 at 1238 am Seams to me the person wrote the article has not one sense of imagination two minions linguistic issues are the speak different language ( the author of this article looks like only speak one language thats bad)  that goes back again no imagination.. I dont understand how a Movie Critic is qualify to critic if never in their life ever work or done movies not to mention on his childhood was not allow to even watch TV that clearly makes that individual not qualify to critic a children movies Im French I speak different language I admit I have horrible grammar and terrible writing but I have a great imagination and Im happy and I can not wait to see that movie and be entertain and not be bitter like Mr. PETER DEBRUGE Reply Beat says June 18 2015 at 240 pm In the article you said ""they work better as supporting characters than as the main attraction"" and you also said that if the villain was better. Without spoiling the movie for those who havent seen it yet (me) why do you think Gru was a better villain than Scarlet? Based on the multiple trailers I feel that she is a worthy attempt at a captivating villain. Either way thank you for reviewing the movie and making me disappointed that the US release date isnt until July 10th. ;) Reply See All 4 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO President On Vinyls Demise On-Screen Violence -TCA Chelsea Vs.
