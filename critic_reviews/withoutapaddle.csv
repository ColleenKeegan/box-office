Steven Brill attempts a modern Deliverance with this tale of three friends who take to the wilds after the death of a mate but ends up with an ineffectual conflicted comedy. Hidden treasure is the guys goal yet each one has to face his own personal demons of course before he can find the true treasure that awaits him and so on... The uneasy mix of sentiment and toilet humour lands this in a no mans land between cosy buddy movie and gross-out lads flick. Green is occasionally amusing as a wimpish doctor ditto Shepard as a brash fantasist; but their characters are too thin and their escapades too hackneyed to involve fully. Being chased by inbred marijuana farmers is about as funny as it gets.

They make the usual pit stops (har-har homoeroticism bears) but the boys relaxed buddy dynamic lifts the charm quotient above average. There are some genuinely clever moments of physical comedy and the inevitable crudeness is offset by winning whimsy. Without has all the freshness of moldering Playboys stashed under a mattress but it evokes what few boys-will-be-boys larks can chumminess.

Beyond that theres not much else. Real laughs that arent centered on bodily functions or altered states are few and far between. Matthew Lillard (left) Dax Shepard and Seth Green star in the tale of boyhood buddies who go off on a treasure hunt in the wilderness. Paramount Pictures In Paddles fish-out-of-water story a trio of 30-year-old buddies friends since boyhood embark on an adventure in the Oregon wilderness to find a lost treasure they had obsessed about as kids. They undertake the trip as a kind of tribute to the fourth member of their close-knit group whose funeral they have just attended. Without a Paddle  1/2 out of four Stars Seth Green Matthew Lillard Dax Shepard Burt Reynolds Director Stephen Brill Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG-13 for drug content sexual material language crude humor and some violence Opens today nationwide But canoeing up a perilous river presents more adventure than they bargained for an encounter with a black bear; a run-in with a couple of backwoods pot farmers who chase the guys with an arsenal of automatic weapons and hand grenades; and a fantasy-style sequence with a pair of sensual hirsute tree-huggers. Most of the movies gags -- not to mention its entire plot -- are revealed in the trailer. So if youve seen that you might want to save your money. But if you must go leave those under age 13 at home. When Paddles primary characters werent much older than 13 themselves they promised each other to ""do great things."" But reality intruded on those childhood dreams. Now Dan (Seth Green) is a doctor plagued with neuroses. He fears the dark enclosed places and cellophane. Jerry (Matthew Lillard) has a loving girlfriend but he prefers surfing to growing up and getting married. Then theres the Harley-riding handsome neer do well Tom (Dax Shepard) who blames his loser father for his own bad luck. Their buddy Billy who died in Costa Rica in a parasailing accident may have been the life of the quartet but we never see him as an adult. Noting the bevy of girls at the funeral service Dan notes ""It was like a discotheque with a coffin in the middle."" As they search for the treasure stashed by a legendary bank robber the three friends are chased by Lynyrd and Skynyrd the hillbilly hemp barons two snarling Rottweilers. The trio and the weed farmers serenade each other with Culture Clubs Do You Really Want to Hurt Me. And then they meet up with a mountain man played by Burt Reynolds who provides the movies brief highlight. In a kind of homage to Deliverance he has been living in the wilderness for 30 years. Fortunately there are no entreaties to squeal like a pig. In a summer filled with dumb comedies this might prove to be the dumbest. Think Road Trip meets City Slickers. Then dial the humor down a few notches and youre left Without a Paddle.

Directed by Steven Brill. Written by Jay Leggett Mitch Rouse Fred Wolf Harris Goldberg and Tom Nursall. (PG-13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Plunk two established comic actors and a reality-TV personality in the treacherous waters of an uneven buddy comedy and watch who emerges a star. Dax Shepard from MTV s ""Punkd"" in his first major big-screen role steals ""Without a Paddle."" Not that its too hard to do. Shepard plays Tom a compulsive liar and loser and part of a trio hunting for lost treasure. Co-stars Matthew Lillard and Seth Green immensely likable actors are never as natural as Shepard. They mug when the occasion seems to call for it but Shepard stays loose as if unaware of the camera. It helps that playing it cool is part of his scammer characters makeup. Lillard and Green by contrast are somewhat restricted by having to play regular guys Lillard a commitment-phobic office worker and Green a fussy doctor. The movies ""Deliverance""-lite premise is beyond contrived. The three take a perilous river trip as an homage to their late friend who left his childhood pals a map to the loot left by D.B. Cooper the real-life skyjacker who vanished in the 1970s. Along the way the men will encounter a bear white-water rapids and to the profound regret of lovers of comedy life lessons. Oh and dont forget the hillbillies required by every broad comedy set outside the city limits. Director Steven Brill made ""Little Nicky"" and ""Mr. Deeds"" so there was nowhere to go but up. He deserves credit for fostering an easy rapport among his actors and for staging a few impressive scenes of physical comedy. When the boys canoe capsizes the actors appear to be in real white water. A scene where Green tangles with a bear seems incredibly lifelike. Either the animal was exceptionally well trained or Brill used undetectable special effects. Set pieces like the bear scene are funny but most of the laughs come from throwaway lines or visual gags. Heading up a mountain and looking for help the men hear rock music prompting Tom to remark ""I never thought I would be so glad to hear something that sounded like Creed."" Anyone whos gotten a load of that Scott Stapp fellow can relate. As they glide down the river the doctor worried about mosquitoes lowers the netting on his jungle hat. Playing the moment stone faced Green evokes Katharine Hepburn in ""The African Queen."" The first half of the film is enjoyable but hit and miss. After that its just miss. A promising setup involving a pair of Julia Butterfly Hill- style tree-sitters descends into an extended potty joke. A pair of cliched yokels (Ethan Suplee and Abraham Benrubi game but wasted) are hell-bent on hunting down the city slickers. Hee haw. The movie eventually turns irrevocably cornball with the doctor finding courage Lillards character discovering the joys of responsibility and all the guys honoring the bonds of friendship. Only Tom remains relatively unchanged which is perhaps the reason Shepard comes off so well. He seems to realize that a screwup doesnt become an upright citizen from a trip down a river and a few excrement and testicle jokes. -- Advisory This film contains drug humor profanity violence.

Unfortunately thats about all it cares about. The movies it loots include John Boormans great ""Deliverance"" Ron Underwoods less great but greatly entertaining ""City Slickers"" and Rob Reiners not-so-bad ""Stand by Me."" Dax Shepard from left Seth Green and Matthew Lillard are city boys ineptly making their way through the wilderness. (Simon Cardwell -- Paramount Pictures) _____Correction_____ In an Aug. 20 review of ""Without a Paddle"" the films setting was incorrectly described as Washington state. The movie takes place in Oregon. _____More in Movies_____  Without a Paddle Details  Watch the Trailer  Latest Movie Releases  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert ""Deliverance"" provides most of the narrative arc as the film chronicles the adventures of some inept city boys as they canoe through the wilderness and eventually -- after the inevitable comic adventures with growly bears and frothy rapids -- are chased by Hollywood-issue rednecks. These bad guys lack teeth hygiene grammar and the ability to choose the proper wine but are abundantly endowed with automatic weapons tattoos and southern accents (though the setting is Washington state). In other words theyve been hastily downloaded from Stereotypes-r-us.com a firm shamed into retiring its other models and one hopes soon to retire this one. When its not actively offending or annoying it does have a few laughs of the God-am-I-really-laughing-at-this? variety and a single moment of grace when Burt Reynolds himself makes an appearance as flat-bellied and charismatic as ever. That lasts about three minutes. Then its back to banality. Tom (Dax Shepard) Jerry (Matthew Lillard) and Dan (Seth Green) are in their thirties with routine lives modest careers and rocky romantic situations. They feel they deserve so much more. Poor babies. Wahhhhhhhhhh. Theyre languishing in their quarter-life crises. Anyway the funeral of a fourth member of their childhood posse reunites them -- this is the ""Stand by Me"" part -- rekindling a childhood dream and so they set off on a river journey through the Washington wilderness. The nominal goal of the quest is the missing fortune their boyhood hero D.B. Cooper vanished with when he bailed out of the plane hed skyjacked back in 1971. Yet the film directed by comedy hack Steve (""Little Nicky"") Brill never manages to make the Cooper quest credible because its busy looking for hillbillies or cracking poop jokes. And Cooper himself has always given me the creeps Who says this guys a folk hero? He was an armed felon who put dozens of people at risk like any bank robber with an AK-47. But the Cooper quest is really a feint. The young actors appear to be on a quest for a different treasure a career as an adult actor. Two of them at least have made modest names for themselves as teenagers in more accomplished comedies. Green of course played Dr. Evils son Scott Evil in the three Austin Powers films but shorn of Mike Myerss antic genius as Dr. Evil he comes across pretty forlorn and unremarkable. As for Lillard hes been a smiley-faced fixture in the ""Scooby Doo"" films as well as the original ""Scream."" Like Green hes not remotely able to impress the camera when hes the whole story. Then theres Dax Shepard Of him I can only ask Who the hell is Dax Shepard and why should anyone care? One of his previous screen credits is ""Vomiter at party."" The movie stirs briefly to life whenever it halts for a long or wide shot of the beautiful Washington forests and mountains which are actually the forests and mountains of New Zealand. Too bad the plot and the actors get in the way. The New Zealand tourism department should sue. And as I said Reynolds still has enough charisma to hold the screen against nearly anybody especially these three human Twinkies. Without a Paddle (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for drug references sexual material a fair amount of comic violence and gross-out humor of the lowest possible common denominator.

""Without a Paddle"" tries very hard to be a sincere pseudo coming-of-age story about 30-year-old men finally discovering who they are and what they want out of life. But because of over-the-top plot elements mediocre acting and lack of chemistry between the three main actors it fails in the attempt. Where it succeeds however is in outrageously stupid silly and sometimes crude moments that color the narrative about three childhood friends lost in the Oregon woods. Luckily good chemistry is not needed to pull off scenes in which a bear mistakes the runt of the trio Dan (Seth Green) for a bear cub and refuses to leave until he gnaws on a furry animal carcass she brought him. Nor is strong acting really necessary when the three men stripped to their underwear and rain-soaked decide they should spoon for warmth. Its not the conflicted macho-man routine that makes this scenario surprisingly funny and inoffensive but rather the fact that R. Kellys ""Bump n Grind"" plays in the background with lyrics ""My minds telling me no but my bodys telling me yes."" _____More in Movies_____  Without a Paddle Details  Watch the Trailer  Latest Movie Releases  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Free E-mail Newsletters_____  News Headlines  News Alert And that is how much of the movie goes. Your mind tells you not to find an iota of amusement in the extremely inane skits but some other part of you tells you to keep watching. As Dan Tom (Dax Shepard) and Jerry (Matthew Lillard) adventure through the woods on a treasure hunt they spent much of their youth planning with a friend who has just died they run into the inevitable problems of city kids lost in fictitious woods the requisite gun-toting backwoods hillbillies a corrupt sheriff dangerous river rapids an eccentric mountain man played by Burt Reynolds and hot tree-hugging au naturel hippie girls. Given this setting the cheesy unconvincing moments centered on the characters serious discussions of life and friendship really seem unnatural and ruin the flow of the physical comedy.

"Without a Paddle | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; without-a-paddle ) Without a Paddle (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli Want to know why Paramount Pictures is struggling? Watch Without a Paddle and youll gain some insight. At least the film understands what it is as is indicated by the steaming pile of excrement that appears 2/3 of the way through the proceedings. By then we dont really need the clue but its appreciated. About the only way to make things worse would have been to add Tom Green to the cast. The pedigree of Without a Paddle isnt promising. The director is Steven Brill whose previous two outings were the Adam Sandler disappointments Little Nicky and Mr. Deeds. Two of the writers who developed the story Fred Wolf and Harris Goldberg list among their combined credits Dicky Roberts Joe Dirt Master of Disguise and Deuce Bigalow. Matthew Lillard is probably best known as Shaggy from the awful Scooby Doo live-action movies. Seth Green will never shake the image of Dr. Evils son. (At least Dax Shepard the third lead is a relative unknown.) With all of that talent how could anything possibly go right? A miracle was needed and God turned a blind eye. The only thing more ineffective than the desperately unfunny stabs at comedy are the lame ""serious"" scenes. For some inexplicable reason director Brill decided that instead of making this a balls-to-the-walls complete gross-out comedy he was going to make Without a Paddle a message movie. The message is supposed to be something about living life to the fullest. But really its about avoiding spending hard-earned money on this turkey. Theres a line about how its possible to re-earn lost money but lost time is irrecoverable. Anyone considering seeing Without a Paddle should remember that. Theres not much of a plot - the story is just an excuse to get three clueless city guys out in the wilderness and have them chased by a bear a mountain man (Burt Reynolds) and a couple of refugees from Deliverance (played by Ethan Suplee and Abraham Benruibi). But for completeness sake Ill provide a synopsis of sorts. Following the death of a friend childhood buddies Jerry (Lillard) Dan (Seth Green) and Tom (Dax Shepard) embark upon a treasure hunt in the Oregon woods to mark their late pals passing. They quickly get lost and wreck their canoe and thats when the unsavory humans and the bear make their appearances. I thought it was going to be tough figuring out which of the performers does the least cringe-inducing work until I considered the acting of veteran thespian Bart the Bear. Bart who is Hollywoods go-to guy when a bear is needed does a more credible job than any of his human co-stars which is a damning indictment to say the least. As for Burt Reynolds small role - the fact that the one-time A-List celebrity has stooped to appearing in Without a Paddle shows how far his star has fallen. Without a Paddle is so bad that it will annoy and/or bore those who have minimal standards and a high tolerance for sewage. This is such an affront to good cinematic taste that those involved should find themselves unable to work in Hollywood for a long time. And the best thing for the potential consumer to do is to avoid it during its hopefully brief theatrical run and when it makes its appearance on video store shelves. Let the flies buzz around it instead.

Latter is the same sentimentality director Steven Brill sandwiched into his chucklesome oeuvre of Adam Sandler vehicles. Latest opus will appeal to same auds. Modest late summer hardtop traffic will be followed fast by splashier rental biz; foreign prospects look up the creek. Not entirely the ""National Lampoons Outward Bound"" exercise suggested by its trailer ""Without a Paddle"" is instead an unstable -- if mostly painless -- mix of low comedy stabs at higher silliness and schmaltz. Latter is the same computer-spat sentimentality director Steven Brill previously sandwiched into his chucklesome oeuvre of Adam Sandler vehicles and ""The Mighty Ducks"" chapters. This latest opus will appeal to the same audiences possibly in smaller numbers due to lack of an identifiable franchise or marquee stars. Modest late summer hardtop traffic will be followed fast by splashier rental biz; however foreign prospects look up the creek. Home movies of four friends from childhood to high school graduation are shown under the opening credits. Great things are expected of them all but 10 years later that prediction has not panned out. Petite perennially picked-on Dan (Seth Green) is a doctor but still dateless and a fraidy cat. Genial Jerry (Matthew Lillard) is so hooked on surfing that he pays dangerously little attention to both a corporate job and live-in girlfriend (Bonnie Somerville). Tactless loudmouth Tom (Dax Shepard) claims hes happily selling Harleys for a living but has high gambling debts and low self-esteem. The cliques fourth most stellar member Billy has just died albeit in typically zesty fashion -- while para-sailing in Costa Rica. The three others are reunited for Billys funeral and afterward impulsively decide to realize their shared childhood dream and find the lost treasure legendary real-life thief/plane hijacker D.B. Cooper disappeared with in a 1972 Pacific Northwest bailout. Turns out Billy had been working out the likely landing spot of that vanished figure all this time. So armed with his maps a canoe and much beer protags head to Oregon. Up to this point entirely New Zealand-lensed pic has been sort of a dumbed-down ""Big Chill"" for early-70s-born boy-men who still get misty over ""Star Wars"" or ""Indiana Jones"" collectibles (seriously those things actually figure in the plot). Some scenes border on the downright mawkish. Last reel also trades in generic ""Awww..."" moments making the important points that friendship is good life is for living and loyal girlfriends are for proposing to. In between of course things lighten up considerably if unevenly. Our heroes run afoul of mean sheriffs bears Class Five rapids and two chunky ""Deliverance""-style hillbilly brothers (Ethan Suplee Abraham Benrubi) -- inadvertently setting the latters vast illegal pot farm alight. Remainder of pic is spent on the run from these well-armed crazies with eventual help from anti-logging hippie chics (Rachel Blanchard Christina Moore) and a shaggy mountain man (actual ""Deliverance"" star Burt Reynolds) who may be connected to old D.B. Cooper himself. A few iffy f/x aside feature is technically smooth and goes down easily enough but without making much of an impression. Chief flaw is that neither script nor direction find a consistent tone to unite funny references to other movies coarse jokes the occasional inspired ones (the wet naked amp; gay-panicked trios having to sleep huddled together for warmth is nicely milked) slapstick action sequences and earnest emotional displays that beg for some saving layer of irony. Three leads each have their moments though they wouldve had more with sparkier material. Reynolds can be a very funny character comedian on demand so its too bad hes asked to pretty much play it straight here. Original score by Christophe Beck is blah but music supervisor Julianne Jordan makes good use of some oldies as well as new tunes.
