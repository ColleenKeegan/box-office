Frustrated that diamond thief Max (Pierce Brosnan) has consistently eluded him FBI agent Stan (Woody Harrelson) follows him to a tropical island where he lives supposedly retired with partner Lola (Salma Hayek). Stan teams up with attractive local cop Sophie (Naomie Harris) in an attempt to catch Max nabbing a priceless diamond being exhibited on a nearby cruise ship.Forced to interact on this small island the two men begin a jokey game of cat and mouse that could have serious consequences. But hey not that serious this is comedy-lite that would rather contrive a situation where the two men must share a bed than create a believable suspenseful scenario. Granted the interplay between Harrelson and Brosnan offers some farcical pleasure but this spreads its plot interest too thin and fails to deliver credible explanations for its characters actions. Don Cheadles Kingpin in particular feels like a plot pawn and Hayek exists purely to provide decoration and token romance. Theres glamour giggles and a couple of good heist scenes but generally this is clumsily signposted and slow. That said audiences seeking mild diversion might prefer approaching it as Lola does her new surroundings The challenge is to find joy in simple things.

"A Thief Not Worth Catching washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On A Thief Not Worth Catching Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 12 2004 ""After the Sunset"" is a heist picture but the true crime is the eight bucks the filmmakers want to steal from you. Best advice Dont let them get away with it. The film is thin insipid and unconvincing except when it argues for Salma Hayeks beauty. Nearly everyone else in it appears to be dozing on the way to payday. Pierce Brosnan plays a very cool high-end burglar whose specialty is that ingenious mix of meticulous planning custom equipment and wit (rather than brute force) known as the caper. Diamonds being a thiefs best friend he has knocked off two of the three known ""Napoleons"" huge doorknob-like gems once legendarily affixed to the emperors ceremonial sword. Now in retirement in the Caribbean with his accomplice and lover (Hayek) he has an opportunity to go three for three The diamond will be displayed on a luxury liner in port for a week. Everyone wants him to steal the stone including his friendly nemesis a frustrated FBI agent (Woody Harrelson) and an American gangster whos taken over the islands crime (Don Cheadle) the former to finally catch him the latter to take the money and run. Meant to be a cat-and-mouse dance between the elegant thief and the more plebeian Fed the movie is much more of a mutt-and-bull movie as Brosnan too lazily evokes the Bond archetype thats paid his rent over the years and Harrelson overacts to the point of nausea throwing the delicate equilibrium of character off. What was meant to be feather-light clever disposable entertainment is just a long travelogue; the only highlights are the crystal-blue waters and Hayeks wardrobe of swimsuits and sleepytime thingies. What annoys me the most about the film is that it doesnt play fair. It wants to sell us on Brosnans insouciant genius as the unflappable Max Burdett yet it never makes us believe it. No one including director Brett Ratner has put the capers together with any particular shrewdness. Instead Burdett has a miraculous assortment of custom gizmos that help in his jobs though of course the movie never documents the engineering electronic and machining skills that would have to go into such devices. I mean what are you supposed to think when at one point he simply pulls out a tiny gadget that (a) deposits acid on a supposedly unbreakable Plexiglas case melting a perfect hole in it and then (b) converts instantly -- while it dangles at the end of a fishing line -- into a delicate set of pincers capable of removing the diamond from its perch in the just-penetrated case. It comes from nowhere; did he buy it in the local Masterthieves R Us outlet or possibly from eBays ""Criminal Equipment"" section? Or what about the remote-control mouse that enables him to take control of an FBI SUV lock it from the outside and drive it robotically to a hidden location with an irate Harrelson aboard? The movie just isnt clever enough by half. What remains is unconvincing light patter between the participants and the vanity that theyre competing with Cary Grant in Hitchcocks genuinely brilliant light caper ""To Catch a Thief"" which is invoked a number of times. Come on who are they kidding? Then theres the somewhat contemptible inclusion of the Cheadle character who exists only to bring a gratuitous element of danger to the picture. The character isnt well thought out and comes close to racial stereotype. Its also quite annoying to see an actor of Cheadles caliber in such a cliche. He played a similar thug in ""Out of Sight"" but in that film he had the room and the time to conjure a fully complex bad guy; this portrait is just phoned in. After the Sunset (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual innuendo.

(AP Photo/Glen Wilson) ... more Photo GLEN WILSON Diamonds are forever. As for rehashed heist comedies ... 1 / 1 Back to Gallery After the Sunset Heist comedy. Starring Pierce Brosnan Salma Hayek Woody Harrelson. Directed by Brett Ratner. Written by Paul Zbyszewski Craig Rosenberg. (PG-13. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The reasons Pierce Brosnan Salma Hayek and Woody Harrelson signed on to ""After the Sunset"" are evident in shots of the Bahamas white sands and aqua waters. It had to be the location. It couldnt have been the script. This mostly terrible heist comedy was written by Craig Rosenberg and Paul Zbyszewski the latter counting among his writing credits the TV game show ""The Weakest Link"" which didnt seem written. Neither does ""Sunset."" Its strung together with cliches instead of puka shells. If its in ""Sunset"" its been seen before once twice 16 times. Its got the FBI agent (Harrelson) obsessed with a suspect (Brosnan) and the retired-criminal girlfriend (Hayek) who cant get her retired-criminal man to quit the game. The gags are just as moldy. One is the time-honored borderline- homophobic scene where two avowed heterosexual men wake up in bed together nude. Theres even a shot of Hayek on a yoga mat that seems to pay homage to ""Gigli."" Now thats low. Director Brett Ratner (""Rush Hour"") has no shame and neither do his actors but the actors are just trying to keep the thing afloat. They aim to please almost to a fault. Brosnan keeps his shirt open most of the time and Hayek finds some pretty dubious reasons to bend over while wearing a bikini. Their romantic chemistry is nil and their kisses more strained than those in a fifth-grade production of ""Romeo and Juliet."" But both are pros and they bring playfulness and affection to their characters banter even when the banter itself is lame. Harrelson seems to be playing against type as an FBI man bent on taking down Brosnans jewel thief Max but ""After the Sunset"" isnt clever enough to cast anyone against type. Soon enough the FBI man is in hemp clothes and cavorting with an island policewoman (Naomie Harris) who is a decorated graduate of the Ford modeling agency -- oops I mean the police academy. The FBI agent grows rather cozy with Max and scenes with Harrelson and Brosnan occasionally hit the mark by playing Brosnans reserve off Harrelsons goofiness. But the cat-and-mouse element rarely holds interest because the mouse has about 30 IQ points on the cat. The agent has come to Maxs Bahamas hideaway because temptation is about to arrive at Maxs door. A rare diamond called the Napoleon 3 (Max already stole the first two) will be on display on the ship docked at the island where Max lives. Thats right on display on a cruise ship -- just make a right at the shrimp sculpture. This notion is so preposterous that you wonder why the filmmakers didnt go further. Why not the Hope diamond? And why bother having it under glass? It should be on a chaise longue on the beach so people can touch it on the way to getting a daiquiri. There would be the same level of doubt about Maxs ability to retrieve it. Maybe the diamond is called the Napoleon 3 because the studio had a product-placement deal with the Bonaparte family. There had to be such an arrangement with the real-life island hotel showcased rather lovingly by Ratners cameras. But the films better moments happen away from the resort area in the slums ruled by an American pimp-entrepreneur (a straight-faced hilarious Don Cheadle) who urges Max to steal the diamond to fund his plans to ""empower"" the island people. He shows Max a project ""It used to be a childrens hospital but Im revitalizing it into a paramilitary training center."" Theres decent satire at work here but it disappears every time Cheadle leaves the screen. -- Advisory This film contains profanity violence sexual situations.

"Theres no plot on the horizon in Sunset - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Theres no plot on the horizon in Sunset By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  November 12 2004 Its official Salma Hayek has become Charo.The actress parades around the piddling jewel-theft comedy like a pair of barely contained breasts on stilts tossing her mane of black hair wearing less in each scene than in the one preceding it (except for when she dons a pair of overalls and she even makes them seem like the punch line to a very dirty joke).Is she sexy? Sure in a retrograde kitten-with-a-whip kind of way. Hugh Hefner for one would love it. But you have to wonder how long the 38-year-old actress can keep this hoochie-mama act going. Probable answer as long as it lets her keep making movies like ""Frida.""""After the Sunset"" is an old-school stag party of a movie about a ""retired"" jewel thief named Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan acting with his beard stubble) whose Bahamas paradise is spoiled by the appearance of A) a cruise ship carrying the last of three priceless Napoleon diamonds (Max has already stolen the first two) and B) his FBI nemesis Agent Stanley Lloyd (Woody Harrelson). Hayek plays Lola Cirillo Maxs partner who would rather have a diamond on her finger.For a movie thats sexist racist and possibly the most deeply closeted gay love story to be released this year ""After the Sunset"" is reasonably entertaining. The opening-sequence robbery of Napoleon diamond No. 2 in Los Angeles may raise hopes that a decent heist flick is in the offing even if the image of Brosnan French-kissing what appears to be a bearded homeless man queers the fun a little. But then director Brett Ratner packs everyone off to the Bahamas and ""Sunset"" comes down with a bad case of the Jimmy Buffetts.Stanley and Max end up being best pals of sorts going on drunken fishing expeditions slathering suntan oil on each others back all the while keeping careful tabs on where the other man is and isnt. They even end up sharing a hotel bed at which point Stanleys fellow agents bust in for some guffawing jokes about the two being a romantic item.Methinks the film doth protest too much.Will Max give into temptation and steal the ice? Will Stanley outfox him or be outfoxed? Actually the movie doesnt much care. Like the Hawaii-set ""The Big Bounce"" released earlier this year ""After the Sunset"" is content to take in the sights and ogle the ladies. Hayek is the main attraction -- and as noted above theres every possibility shes a beard -- but Naomie Harris of ""28 Days Later"" is also on hand as an island policewoman who tells Stanley she never sleeps with vacationing white boys and who jumps in the sack with him a few scenes further on.There is a black man in the movie; hes the bad guy a gangster whos tearing down a childrens hospital to build a paramilitary training facility. Don Cheadle plays him with a guilt-faced minimum of effort.The dialogue is strictly reheated Rat Pack -- Max actually says ""If its good enough for Frank its good enough for me"" at one point -- which isnt surprising considering that co-screenwriter Paul Zbyszewskis sole previous credit is the TV game show ""The Weakest Link."" ""After the Sunset"" will itself look a lot better when it turns up on Cinemax at 1 a.m. in a few weeks.Eventually Ratner and company cough up a climactic robbery and a halfhearted plot twist or two. Fine; its hard to hate a movie whose heart is stuck in the early-70s era of high hubba-hubba. For men who came of age then ""After the Sunset"" may even feed some middle-age fantasies. Exactly what fantasies those are Im not sure I want to know.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.After the Sunset1/2 (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

After the Sunset Movie Review (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/after-the-sunset-2004,200,afterthesunset11,afterthesunset,rogerebert
"Crime Doesnt Pay in Sunset washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Crime Doesnt Pay in Sunset Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Jen Chaney Special to The Washington Post Friday November 12 2004 IN MOST HEIST movies the conniving central characters plot. And scheme. Then conspire. In ""After the Sunset"" a purported heist flick that sucks all the style out of stealing the protagonists talk. And talk. Then talk some more to the point that you the audience member are ready to step into the film concoct your own plan nab the expensive diamond and use your newly acquired riches to head straight to the Bahamas so you can tell the main characters to shut up already and get down to business. The Paradise Island setting in ""Sunset"" directed by Brett Ratner of ""Rush Hour"" fame may be the movies most attractive asset. After gazing at the turquoise sea that laps right up to the back door of Pierce Brosnans beachfront home the first thing most moviegoers will want to do is check airline fares to Nassau. But before booking that trip at least read ""Sunsets"" plot description. Brosnan plays Max Burdett a stereotypical crafty crook who along with partner-in-crime-and-romance Lola (Salma Hayek) has stolen a couple of valuable and sparkly diamonds. Having pulled off one final heist at the expense of bungling FBI agent Stan Lloyd (Woody Harrelson) Max and Lola retire to a sweet villa in the Bahamas where they plan to spend the rest of their lives soaking up sun slurping on lobster and knocking back whiskey. But Max seems bored. Hes itching to thieve. At which point Stan just happens to show up and inform him that a cruise ship called the Seven Seas which coincidentally is exhibiting the only Napoleon diamond that Max and Lola havent pinched will soon be docking nearby. Stan eager to catch the couple in the act says he plans to keep his eye on them which raises a few pivotal plot-related questions. Will Max come out of retirement against the lovely Lolas wishes and try to snake the jewel? Will Stan finally ensnare this unbeatable burglar and savor the taste of delicious vengeance? And perhaps most importantly will Remington Steele finally get his groove back? ""After the Sunset"" fizzles so quickly that its hard to care about the answers to any of the cliched mysteries it attempts to solve. Virtually all the stars even supporting players Naomie Harris and Don Cheadle (soon to be seen in another heist picture ""Oceans Twelve"") look like theyre sleepwalking through this less-than-credible story. Brosnan does his best to smolder and Hayek flashes her cleavage every chance she gets but its not enough to turn the lackluster action into anything vaguely smart or sexy. The main problem aside from the aimless screenplay is the Stan-and-Max dynamic. The movies promising opening sequence sets up a clearly adversarial relationship between the dark and handsome Irishman and the blond and goofy American that according to the production notes leads to ""a riveting game of cat and mouse."" But once in the Bahamas Stan and Max act more like mismatched buddies a la ""Rush Hours"" Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan than genuine opponents. Though Harrelson appearing in his first starring role since 1999s forgettable ""Play It to the Bone"" tries to squeeze all the comic pulp he can from this connection his scenes with Brosnan lack juice. Without a genuine sense of intrigue between its protagonist and antagonist the movie can do nothing but flounder. Naturally ""After the Sunset"" tries to tie all of its plot strands together with a neat-o twist ending one you just know is coming when Stan tells Max early in the film that he hates twist endings. But instead of punctuating the Caribbean antics with a finally-it-all-makes-sense moment the conclusion comes across as a last-ditch attempt at crime-caper cool. Please. You want a riveting game of cat and mouse? Ive got three words for you Tom and Jerry. AFTER THE SUNSET (PG-13 93 minutes) -- Contains sexuality violence and language. Area theaters.

Director Brett Ratner refuses to cut away when Salma Hayek faces the camera or bends over -- not that theres anything wrong with that. New Line Cinema Just as studied is the confident refusal of After the Sunset director Brett Ratner to cut away whenever Brosnans cohort a sparsely bodiced Salma Hayek faces the audience and bends over. Back at NYU film school which Ratner also attended my professors used to call this ""subjective camera."" (Related video See a preview of After the Sunset) Well why not? This is a caper movie full of attractive people plus Woody Harrelson even if he is one of the actors not mentioned as being in the running to replace Brosnan as James Bond. Harrelson who has scattered good moments plays an emotionally shaky FBI agent who shows up in the tropical Brosnan-Hayek digs because he just knows theyre up to something. ""Something"" turns out to be a display of Napoleons diamonds ripe for the plucking. About the movie After the Sunset   (out of four) Stars Pierce Brosnan Salma Hayek Woody Harrelson Don Cheadle Directors Brett Ratner Distributor New Line Rated PG-13 for sexuality violence and language Opens Friday nationwide Like Brosnans last outing (springs Laws of Attraction) the movie gets off to a brief breezy start. This time its at a Los Angeles Lakers game. Then it goes the way of all movies that feature Shaquille ONeal. The color photography is lush the leads are easy to watch and theres some cute interplay between Harrelson and a sexy constable (Naomie Harris) that could have used more development. But the movie grows progressively more routine in quarter-hour increments eventually collapsing under the weight of its own insignificance. Wasted in all this is Don Cheadle as a local hood. The script tries to distinguish the character by making him a huge fan of The Mamas amp; The Papas. But Monday-Mondays likely lackluster box office report probably will mean this movie sinks quickly into the DVD sunset.

""Doesnt have a fancy name"" he growls ""but if it was good enough for Frank its good enough for me."" Im not sure that line would have been good enough for Frank but Brosnan still sexy in gray stubble delivers it as though it was. Set in the Bahamas After the Sunset is a fun-in-the-sun heist caper that director Brett Ratner stages as if he were the activities director of a cruise ship. He wants us to get off on the packaged trappings -- the umbrella cocktails the cavernous hotel suites the postcard vistas -- and the actors perform with such cheeky hey-were-on-location nonchalance that the movie barely musters the illusion that theres anything at stake. That however is just whats appealing about it. As Brosnans Max a diamond thief extraordinaire ""retires"" to the islands with his lover and accomplice (Salma Hayek) we know that hes really going in for one last score and so does Stan (Woody Harrelson) the defrocked FBI agent who has tailed him there. As the two attempt to outwit each other even if it means crawling into the same bed the result is a knowingly preposterous toy thriller -- a sheer escape from consequence. After the Sunset is really a tropical knockoff of the 1999 Thomas Crown Affair remake with the Rene Russo character split in two. Hayek doesnt have much to do besides pout and doff her clothes but she does that extremely well and Harrelson as Brosnans buddy/nemesis/stalker turns his goofiness into a royal prank on the audience.

No one is ever going to mistake this for great art but it has a charismatic cast moves with an effortless pace and in the end almost makes you forget that it doesnt do anything memorable. The film contains elements of a heist movie a mismatched buddy picture a sultry romance and a James Bond thriller. There are all the requisite double-crosses and a twist at the end that a blind man can see coming. After the Sunset doesnt accomplish any of its aims exceptionally well but it does them with just enough A(c)lan to keep the majority of the audience involved and entertained. And if ones interest starts to wane theres plenty to look at. Veteran cinematographer Dante Spinotti captures the natural beauty of the Caribbean with almost as much flair as he shoots Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek. With two such photogenic actors no viewer need ever be bored. After the Sunset begins with the would-be final caper in the careers of master jewel thieves Max (Brosnan) and Lola (Hayek). After relieving FBI agent Stan Lloyd (Woody Harrelson) of one of the three Napoleon diamonds they disappear to an island paradise to enjoy their retirement. It doesnt take long before Max starts to feel like a prisoner; hes itching to try one more score and his opportunity arrives with a cruise ship bearing another of the Napoleon diamonds. Along with the ship comes Agent Lloyd who hooks up with a local cop Sophie (Naomie Harris). And the islands kingpin (Don Cheadle) offers the infamous thief a lucrative partnership. The pull of committing the crime is almost too great to resist but there is one thing holding Max back - Lola is serious about being retired. She has no intention of getting back in the business and stealing the gem is a two-person job. One of the weakest elements of After the Sunset is the caper. Its a generic steal-the-diamond-and-run heist and the lack of inspiration invested in this aspect of the screenplay makes it apparent that the writers were more interested in other things. The hate/grudging admiration relationship between Stan and Max is one of the films most enjoyable parts. Both actors develop appealing characters and theres plenty of humor in their interaction. A scene with a shark is good for a few full-bellied laughs. These two are in a constant contest of one-upsmanship and its fun to watch them work each other. (Max is the better manipulator - or so it seems). They connect so well that Im willing to forgive the cheap joke that forces them into an indelicate position. Equally enticing is the relationship between Max and Lola. These two generate plenty of heat. Why lie on the hot sand when you can bask in Brosnan and Hayeks glow? Some things arent as successful. For example the relationship between Stan and Sophie is strained and artificial. Don Cheadles gangster while he exhibits a few quirky characteristics doesnt serve any purpose beyond providing a red herring. And although the movie explicitly references To Catch a Thief its wishful thinking on the part of the filmmakers that audiences would connect this movie to the Cary Grant classic. A more likely connection is to the Bond films. It wouldnt have surprised to me to see Q hiding somewhere in the background. Not only does Max have a remote control that allows him to drive a car without sitting inside it but he has an acid drill that can eat through any ""impenetrable"" surface. After the Sunset borders on being described as a ""guilty pleasure"" because despite not being especially well-written it nevertheless offers a 100-minute unpretentious diversion. Director Brett Ratner (Rush Hour) gets the tone right and the actors play along. After the Sunset is a film of small moments and big laughs. If the production doesnt deliver on the level of The Sting at least we dont walk out of the theater feeling stung.

Its hard to imagine what attracted the in-demand talents before and behind the camera to this trifle other than the prospect of a well-paid holiday in the Bahamas. Resulting mild take will stir only mild B.O. interest. You need at least one very good reason to exhume the moribund jewel heist genre and the makers of ""After the Sunset"" cant find one. Its hard to imagine what attracted the in-demand talents before and behind the camera to this trifle other than the prospect of a well-paid holiday in the Bahamas. Resulting mild take on the mossy premise of retired diamond thieves tempted by one final job will unsurprisingly stir only mild B.O. interest. In a grizzled variation on his successful starring turn in ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" a remake that arguably justified itself with its high style and added twists Pierce Brosnan takes it easy this time as Max Burdett. Max is a thief who having made a huge ""final"" score with g.f. and partner-in-crime Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek) finds it difficult to stay out of trouble in paradise despite the comforts of a beachfront villa and Lolas ever-ready enticements. Following the couple from Los Angeles to the islands is FBI agent Stan Lloyd (Woody Harrelson) a maladroit oaf whos been trying unsuccessfully to nail Max for years. The forging of an at-times intimate relationship between hunter and prey reps the scripts one stab at something vaguely fresh but the erratic comic timing of director Brett Ratner and thesps not especially known for generating hilarity makes the eruptions of humor intermittent at best. The arrival in the Bahamas of an enormous cruise ship featuring a jewelry exhibit with ""The Third Napoleon Diamond"" as its centerpiece gives Max the itch again and provides Stan with one more chance to snare him. As Max is thought to have snatched the first two Napoleons there is presumably no way he can resist this one. All along he promises the loving Lola hes through even as he pays a casual visit to the ship to examine the enormous rock and its high security chamber. Odd and unconvincing subplot sees Max being courted by the islands top gangster transplanted Yank Henri Moore (Don Cheadle) to form a partnership to grab the jewel. Somewhat more engaging teamwork comes courtesy of Harrelsons Stan and local cop Sophie played with spirit if a variable islands accent by British thesp Naomie Harris. After initially arresting him Sophie warms up to the goofy Stan professionally and emotionally and their boisterousness somewhat offsets the more grounded personalities of Max and Lola. While Brosnan and Hayek canoodle frequently and with ease Brosnan -- in a role Robert Mitchum could have played smashingly in his sleep -- broods and strategizes by becoming recessive to diminishing returns. Casting the rigors of ""Frida"" behind for the moment Hayek flaunts her sexiness in a rare mainstream turn. While ""After the Sunset"" is never exactly dull and is smartly cut to a brief running time it never quickens the pulse despite numerous lingering views of Hayeks scenic decolletage that are as precisely staged as payoff shots in 3-D films. The faces locations and costumes are attractive and colorful but Ratner and lenser Dante Spinotti dont take matters a step further to imbue the picture with a lustrous sheen and seductive style to augment the scattered amusements of the story. Vet composer Lalo Schiffrin contributes some agreeably retro frissons working in a traditional romantic thriller musical vein. Many viewers will laugh and/or smirk at the opening sequence set at a Lakers/Clippers game that prominently features shots of Kobe Shaq Karl Malone and coach Phil Jackson among other former teammates.
