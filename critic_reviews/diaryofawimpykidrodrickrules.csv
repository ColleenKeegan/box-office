As before Kinneys simplistic drawings are arbitrarily superimposed over some of the live-action scenes but do little to enhance what scant story there is. The first film centred on the crisis of confidence experienced by Zachary Gordons nerdy middle-school pupil Greg; this covers his ongoing conflict with his bullying wannabe-rockstar brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) and his yearnings for empty-headed schoolmate Holly (Peyton List). Most of the kids continue to irritate and for a comedy aimed at youngsters the laughs are woefully scarce.

STEPHEN COLE The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 25 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Mar. 24 2011 314PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The responsible film guardian will feel anxious early on in the latest Diary of a Wimpy Kid instalment as the title milksop is humiliated a dozen or so times in the opening sequence a family trip to a roller-skating rink. First middle-school student Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) is forced to recall a scalding public embarrassment - peers shrieking at his eye-patch-sized swimsuit at a pool. Then hes cowering in a washroom stall bound in toilet paper. After that hes tricked into eating pizza someone sat on. Next comes a bungled attempt at dancing with a cool towering blonde. Finally the 12-year-old gets the old vaudeville kiss-off - a pastry in the kisser. He slips and falls in someones birthday cake. And so questions begin to form in the responsible film guardians mind Do I really want the little guy beside me here contemplating endless variations of public shame? Can this really be good for us? Pretty soon though Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules a sequel to the 2010 hit based on Jeff Kinneys Wimpy Kid book series begins pointing the finger of scorn at Gregs responsible excruciatingly prudent caregivers Gregs mother it turns out is an overbearing liberal a newspaper columnist who strongly believes in Big Family handouts. Susan Heffley (Rachael Harris) even carries ""mom dollars"" that are dispensed to her kids whenever Greg and older brother Rodrick appear to be getting along. These vouchers can later be exchanged for real money. Dad would prefer to be paid in silent neglect. Frank Heffley (Steve Zahn) just wants to be left alone to play with his Civil War armies in the basement. (""Theyre not toys theyre figurines"") Gregs primary tormentor Rodrick (Torontos Devon Bostick) is also seen in a satirical light. Hes no better than Greg with girls. Big brother is also dyslexic. The name of the 16-year-olds band is Loded Diper. Once it becomes clear that the new Diary of a Wimpy Kid is an equal-opportunity offender and that it is the politically correct modern family that is being picked on rather than young Greg the film becomes cheerfully mischievous fun for everyone. One giddy scene here has Gregs best friend the hopelessly honest Rowley Jefferson (Robert Capron) coming over for a sleepover. Rowleys dad hands the boy over with a DVD of the good-for-young-minds kid show Soft Bears. Aaaah. The boys go upstairs to Gregs room. Soon mom shows up with a plate of good-for-young-bodies broccoli spears. Mmm-mmm. And when the door slams shut with mom safely gone Greg whips out a horror movie featuring a big-bosomed starlet - that and a Santas-bag-sized haul of salty snacks. The plot to Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules is a see-sawing feud between Greg and Rodrick that is resolved at their hometowns annual talent show. But all of that including a big production number finale is simply an excuse for all the Heffleys to get on and off each others nerves. The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series might more aptly be titled Diary of a Wimpy Family.. The film sequel is more engaging than the original was because it spends more time at home. That makes sense. A kid dealing with a mad mom offers more comic and dramatic potential than the same child tiptoeing around a deranged gym teacher.

Unfortunately the sequel isnt as authentic as its predecessor. Starring Zachary Gordon Devon Bostick Robert Capron Steve Zahn Rachael Harris Peyton List Ben Hollingsworth Robert Capron Michelle Harrison Grayson Russell Director David Bowers Running time 136 Release Opened Mar 25 2011  Editorial Review A middle school Holden CaulfieldBy Michael OSullivanFriday March 25 2011The huge popularity of the ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" books can be traced to one simple fact They ring true. Their underachieving preteen hero Greg Heffley -- whose diaries they purport to be -- has no reason to lie. Hes writing (and drawing stick-figure-like illustrations) in a private journal after all. As a result the picture they paint of the modern middle-schooler feels very real. At times Greg can be an inconsiderate lazy ungenerous and resentful screw-up though hes basically a good and mordantly observant kid. Flip through a few pages and just count the number of times you see the words ""to be honest with you"" and ""the truth is."" Hes a flawed and funny Holden Caulfield Jr. a bumbler with backbone.If only the new movie based on the second book in the series ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules"" were as candid or as hilarious.Oddly the latest live-action adaptation of author and illustrator Jeff Kinneys bare-bones novel/comic strip -- directed by former animator David Bowers from a script by Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah -- comes across as more cartoonish and less sincere than the original. One of the greatest offenders is Steve Zahn. The actor who plays Gregs dim-bulb dad Frank and who is at his best when deadpan is guilty here of almost criminally pop-eyed mugging. As the titular Rodrick Gregs teenage brother and chief tormentor Devon Bostick verges on the sadistic. More heartfelt and low key is the performance of Zachary Gordon as the now seventh-grade Greg. Gordon manages to capture Gregs put-upon likability standing out in a cast of mostly lackluster juvenile supporting actors whose characters pale in comparison to their literary antecedents. How is it even possible that Gregs best friend Rowley -- whose nearly catatonic gap-toothed facial expression never changes in the books -- seems somehow more three dimensional on paper than as embodied by the rotund child actor Robert Capron?The problem doesnt really lie in the acting but in the writing. Theres too much effort expended on making the kids cute and cuddly instead of plausible. As my 11-year-old son (and expert focus group) put it you end up feeling sorry for Greg when you should be laughing at him.Not that there arent some amusing moments. If your sense of humor is still fixated on poop stains incontinent birds flatulence underwear and diapers youll have if not a field day at least a few giggles.Unlike the book whose focus like an actual diary is somewhat scattershot ""Rodrick Rules"" centers on Gregs infatuation with Holly Hills (Peyton List) a pretty girl whos clearly out of his league and his ongoing antagonistic relationship with Rodrick. Thats okay. It makes for a more cinematic -- if conventional -- narrative and this is after all a movie.You cant fault the filmmakers for reshaping a diary into a cohesive film. You can however fault them for taking one of the great antiheroes in preteen literature and turning him into well an even wimpier kid.Contains mild scatalogical humor and the music of Keha.

Photo Getty Images Dante had Virgil to guide him through hell but when it comes to the collection of bloodcurdling humilia tions and rage-inducing in justices known as seventh grade well just have to make do with Greg Heffley as the titular autobiographer in ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules."" Last years original was a surprise hit turning Jeff Kinneys popular series of kids books into a bouncy screen version that seemed born in wry memories filtered through fond reminiscences like those in ""A Christmas Story"" or ""The Wonder Years."" Example a cursed piece of Swiss cheese lay untouched and moldering on the playground for so long that a mythology sprang up around it. Anyone who touched it (or even touched anyone who touched it) carried the terrible burden of the ""Cheese Touch"" until he could pass it along to the next doomed soul. This time out the name of the game is contrived physical comedy and gross-out gags -- eating pizza that unbeknownst to the diner was discarded by others at the rubbish bin or sitting on a melted candy bar in the car on the way to church. The latter leads to unfair charges of poopy pants. Seventh-graders are far cooler and more anarchic than depicted in this often-dopey movie which is aimed at more of a fourth-grade sensibility. Greg (Zachary Gordon) and his late-teen brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick a slightly more interesting new version of Jimmy Fallon) get an opportunity when their parents leave the house so they throw a big party. At which toilet paper gets strewn around and kids wildly drink Cokes. So there isnt much to this party but concealing its existence from the boys parents forms the bulk of the film which is even more episodic and scattershot than the first one. Gregs best friend the pudgy redhead Rowley (Robert Capron) was more developed the first time around with his wide-eyed unself-conscious goofiness frequently achieving surprise social victories while the squirming and neurotic Greg frets about his status in the pack. This time Rowley is largely in the background though he does a climactic unintentionally funny magic act at a talent show. In the first ""Wimpy Kid"" Rowley became a legend by busting out a wicked dance -- with his mom -- that grooved on chords struck by two classics (Oedipus ""Napoleon Dynamite""). Like R2D2 Rowley is the comedy relief who often holds the secret to everything and more of him is needed. At school where Greg is pursuing a blond cutie Holly who seems out of his league the usual dreary slapstick embarrassments ensue as Rodrick does his best to sabotage his brothers romantic efforts. But in a nicely underplayed scene at a nursing home where each child is visiting a grandparent Greg finds that being himself is the best way to get to know Holly. With its fondness for devising ways to force Greg to get caught in his underwear or stuck in a ladies room amid a terrifying gaggle of octogenarians the movie might be unaware that it is carrying a nice little hidden message but it is and it works. As the nerdette mom Rachael Harris also brings a lot of spirited warmth and completely believable adoration for her feuding sons whom she tries to bribe into liking each other with ""Mombucks."" Harris lightly steals the show at the end when her all-forgiving mompride has her dancing exceptionally mommishly to Rodricks heavy-metal band. The audience rightly prefers her to the musical stylings of the band (""Loded Diper""). As the dad though the rapidly declining asset known as Steve Zahn is lost in flailing gestures and flustered cluelessness. He seems to be completing the final stages of his transition to becoming William H. Macy. It makes me feel very old to say this but Zahn was once funny. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Kors Madison Avenue Flagship opens this week Read Next Kors Madison Avenue Flagship opens this week Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16058 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(Rob McEwan) Joe Neumaier Friday March 25 2011 400 AM Title Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2 Rodrick Rules With Zachary Gordon Devon Bostick. A middle-school loser must contend with his obnoxious older brother. Director David Bowers (136). PG. At area theaters.Last years first ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" flick based on the goofy book series by Jeff Kinney had an offbeat charm and a refreshingly innocent view of American kidhood middle-school division.The bland follow-up ""Rodrick Rules"" goes by the same playbook but somehow feels even thinner than the black-and-white line drawings that fill Kinneys books and are used here in the title sequence.Greg (Zachary Gordon) is now a slightly more savvy seventh-grader but he still travels in a pack of losers including roly-poly Rowley (Robert Capron) and oddball Fregley (Grayson Russell).With his geek initiation now a year behind him Greg is trying to impress a new girl in school while also staying on the good side of mom and dad (Rachael Harris and Steve Zahn).But Gregs would-be badass older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) keeps annoying him until some mom-imposed bonding time between the boys brings about a kind-of cootie detente. High-schooler Rodrick even teaches his little bro about some of the finer things in life like how to gross out people with fake vomit and the best way to avoid doing chores.The almost retro innocence of Kinneys stories is quirkily almost-hip -- Greg and Rodrick are like Beaver and Wally for the Wii age -- but one suspects ""Rodrick Rules"" will be better enjoyed by parents happy their skateboarding guys are watching this instead of playing ""Grand Theft Auto III.""Real-life kids of all stripes -- fat kids skinny kids kids who climb on rocks -- may find it a touch too bland and aggravatingly episodic.Young Gordon however retains a sweet junior Hanks-ian style while Russell is again unafraid to be the fall guy and Bostick is less wired than the first time round. Harris and the sleepy-looking Zahn generally succeed in showing how geeks can beget geeks.Still it probably will play well for audiences just a bit younger than the protagonists. In which case families of 9-year-olds be warned Fake vomit may be making a comeback.

"Wimpy Kid clobbers many other family films - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Wimpy Kid clobbers many other family films By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions Leave it to a wimpy kid to show Hollywood how to make a family movie with live people in it. By Diyah Pera 20th Century Fox Seventh grade is hardly heaven Greg (Zachary Gordon) has his best friend Rowley (Robert Capron) by his side as he battles adolescent angst and a bothersome big brother. EnlargeClose By Diyah Pera 20th Century Fox Seventh grade is hardly heaven Greg (Zachary Gordon) has his best friend Rowley (Robert Capron) by his side as he battles adolescent angst and a bothersome big brother. Though not as layered or entertaining on dual levels as a Pixar comedy Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules manages some earnest laughs with old-fashioned sentiment. A sequel to the surprise 2010 hit Rodrick works the way the first one did by not overextending our hero beyond his middle-school concerns. Hollywood has taken lately to casting kids to save the world (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) or to swear like and kill adults (Kick-Ass Let the Right One In). Not so in Rodrick a movie content with the horrors of adolescent love and sibling rivalries. Based on the best-selling follow-up novel by Jeff Kinney Rodrick follows hapless Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) as he becomes a seventh-grader and begins what he thinks will be a life of upperclassman privilege. But Greg discovers hes still a punk to older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) still afraid of the gym shower and still tongue-tied when he tries to chat up a classmate. This could play as fodder for an after-school special but director David Bowers infuses the movie with enough contemporary attitude to make it believable Rodrick and Greg have an out-of-control party the moment the parents leave for a trip. Rodrick gives some sound advice to Greg in case hes caught red-handed by grown-ups (deny deny deny). About the movie Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules  1/2 (out of four)Stars Zachary Gordon Devon Bostick Rachael Harris Steve Zahn Director David Bowers Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG for some mild rude humor and mischief Running time 1 hour 36 minutesOpens Friday nationwide None of it amounts to belly-aching laughs but Rodrick clicks in much the way A Christmas Story became a cult hit by viewing the world through the eyes of an ordinary kid. Dances are a big deal. Baths are a pain. Parties are everything. Rodrick also gets the camaraderie and competition of the schoolyard right. Boys vie for girls attention sometimes ruthlessly. Brothers may be blood kin but theyre also sworn enemies. The film doesnt follow much of a story arc but both kids give strong performances. Rodrick in particular could come off as cartoonishly cruel. But Bostick looking a lot like his younger co-star holds his hormonal flux in check enough to show a deep if unspoken adoration for his kid brother. It wouldnt be a kids movie if parents didnt get the short end of the stick and Rachael Harris and Steve Zahn dont get to do much beyond shake their heads and dance like dorks. But Wimpy has worked as a franchise (the books have sold more than 40 million copies) by getting the small stuff right without the heavy-handed lecturing of Glee or the too-adult-for-school stars of High School Musical. Hes not a straight-A kid but this wimp has earned the right to matriculate to another film. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

In all likelihood youve already seen the first film released last year which captured the books prepubescent high jinks and unrelenting hostility but none of its charm. It consisted of kids being mean to other kids for an hour and a half with a side order of stale cheese. By comparison Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules is a work of art. OK so maybe thats going too far. Middle-schooler Greg (Zachary Gordon) now in seventh grade is still a misguided little man who continually dumps on his best friend the kindhearted good-natured Rowley (Robert Capron). Greg is still psychologically brutalized by his teenage brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) who just might be the single most abusive movie sibling since Bette Davis in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? ""Having a brother is really overrated"" Greg complains with good reason. But Rodrick Rules has a brighter comic edge than its predecessor -- and a bit more spunk. Director David Bowers (Astro Boy Flushed Away) injects his first live-action feature with snappy pacing and a few amusing fantasy bits that offset the plots more obnoxious devices. They include a lame attempt to bribe Greg and Rodrick into spending quality time together a program devised and administered by their desperate mother (Rachael Harris) while their ineffectual father (Steve Zahn) nods and glares in various directions. This fails miserably. The details behind its collapse arent necessary except to say the program ends in a brawl at church over a badly placed chocolate stain. Fed up their parents ground the boys and leave them home alone for the weekend bad move Mom and Dad. Rodrick goes all Risky Business on them locking his brother in the basement and throwing a raucous party fueled entirely by soft drinks. (I didnt know you could play drinking games with Coca-Cola.) Meanwhile Greg pines for an adorable blondie at school (Peyton R. List). In adapting Kinneys novel screenwriters Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah have nicked a few bits from the third book in the series The Last Straw and added some conceits of their own for instance Rowley lip-syncing to Kehas TiK ToK an interlude far more amusing than it sounds. The point of all the PG family dysfunction is naturally a Lesson in Selfless Brotherly Love which naturally occurs in the final reel in a scene with a spandex unitard. And its touching in its way. That said I found it difficult to sit through Wimpys nonstop underage nastiness which is tougher to stomach on the screen than the page. Even the two 10-year-olds I brought to the screening one of them mine complained that Rodricks campaign of terror was way worse than anything normally dished out by older siblings. In real life observed my son ""all teenagers arent gargoyles"" and I couldnt have said it better myself. Rodrick Rules marks an improvement on the original Wimpy Kid but it still has a mean streak a mile wide. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Tactical Cree XML 4000-Lumen LED Flashlight for 8 + free...

The people who made Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules that is. This dull square follow-up to 2010s far sprightlier Diary of a Wimpy Kid is still adapted from Jeff Kinneys wonderful illustrated books about middle schooler Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) his family his roly-poly pal Rowley (Robert Capron) and his strategies to survive the existential hell that is grades 6 to 8. Although the cast is the same (minus Chloe Moretz who went on to bigger stuff and whose character Angie Steadman wasnt part of Kinneys original novels anyway) the scriptwriters and director are different. I dont know whether the first production team used up all the vitamins on the set but the second team certainly demonstrates the effects of inspiration-poor blood. The whole movie unspools like a halfhearted school assignment just going through the motions and then adding a nice binder cover. Because teachers like covers. Greg is in seventh grade now which he thinks is cool. A whole new class of sixth graders has arrived to be picked on. Gregs older brother Rodrick -- he of the gnarly rock band Loded Diper -- is still tormenting him though which is so not cool -- especially because Greg has plenty to deal with including a shy crush on a pretty new girl at school (Peyton List). The parental Heffleys played by Steve Zahn and Rachael Harris are about as warmly semi-dorky as they were the first time around. The bossy know-it-all show-offy girl Patty Parrell (Laine MacNeil) in Gregs class is still a show-off. Nothing is new which is a problem. Nothing is particularly funny or endearing which is a worse problem. Its a tough day in middle school -- and for the movies middle-school audience -- when the super-nerdy Fregley (Grayson Russell) steals all the scenes of adolescent bonding.

Diyah Pera/20th Century Fox Diary Of A Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules Director David Bowers Genre Comedy Running Time 96 minutes Rated PG for some mild rude humor and mischief With Zachary Gordon Devon Bostick Rachael Harris Steve Zahn Watch Clips Mom Bucks Mom Bucks Credit 20th Century Fox Secrets To An Easy Life Secrets To An Easy Life Credit 20th Century Fox I Googled Her I Googled Her Credit 20th Century Fox Its an inalienable right of childhood to appreciate a little formulaic entertainment without fun-killing adults telling you how formulaic it is. But its an inalienable right of parenthood to minimize your consumption of material thats utterly boring if you arent 8 years old. That makes some movies difficult to condemn but also difficult to recommend. One such is Diary Of A Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules which shifts the focus of the burgeoning film franchise -- based on Jeff Kinneys wildly popular books about seventh-grader Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) -- from Gregs school life to his home. The stories this time are loosely organized around Gregs relationship with his sneering older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick). But for the most part this is a collection of set pieces that movies have served up many many times before The Disastrous Party When Mom And Dad Were Away. The New Girl At School. The Unlikely Triumph At The Talent Show. Everything is entirely by the numbers more so here than the first time around -- the interesting girl journalist from the first film played by Chloe Moretz has been replaced by a nondescript dream girl (Peyton List) with no personality at all. The films complete lack of originality may not bother kids as much as it will adults -- not because kids are dumb but because they havent sat through all of its predecessors the way their parents have. Every beat in the story of the wild party for instance follows every template laid down from The Cosby Show to Sixteen Candles. But if you hadnt seen those would it matter as much? But if the plot weaknesses arent a complete deal-breaker the presentation might well be. In sharp contrast to the Wimpy Kid books which are instantly recognizable for their spare vibrant line drawings the films have little style at all. Rodrick Rules was directed by David Bowers who directed the animated films Flushed Away and Astro Boy and who presents this story with a blankness that wouldnt seem out of place on the Disney Channel. Even when Kinneys drawings flash briefly on the screen the primary effect is to underline what a generic-looking film has been made from such great-looking books. i When theyre not dodging the horrors of middle school Greg and his best friend Rowley (Robert Capron left) give in to the scarifying temptations of the late-night movie. Diyah Pera/20th Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Diyah Pera/20th Century Fox When theyre not dodging the horrors of middle school Greg and his best friend Rowley (Robert Capron left) give in to the scarifying temptations of the late-night movie. Diyah Pera/20th Century Fox Its a bit problematic too that Greg as played by Gordon isnt as sympathetic as you might expect. The kind of kid-acting on display here is heavy on mugging and big gestures and there are moments in which Rodricks constant desire to slam doors in his face is disturbingly easy to understand. For all these reasons Rodrick Rules is not part of the new breed of kids movies both live-action and animatedthat parents have come to hope for -- films with accessible wit and an inventiveness they can appreciate. For kids who love the Wimpy Kids books and who dont have especially high expectations it may suffice. But its not a movie with broad appeal -- for the simple reason that if youve already seen this story in a hundred other versions nothing in the execution is adequate to bring it back to life.

Happily this hotly awaited follow-up to last years hit adaptation of Jeff Kinneys wildly popular Wimpy Kid book series establishes its own charming reason for being.Last year the focus was on Greg Heffleys awkward adjustment to middle school and tension over whether his longtime friendship with the lovably square Rowley would survive his misguided plans to become a ""cool"" sixth-grader.But this one which brings back the winning Zachary Gordon along with the rest of the appealing cast for Gregs second year of middle school focuses on the difficulties of being bullied by an older brother and Gregs crush on the new girl at school who everyone says is hopelessly out of his reach.Under the direction of David Bowers (taking over for Thor Freudenthal) the screenplay by returning writers Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah is not only faithful to Kinneys keen eye for reality-rooted adolescent angst it plays with it -- generously layering the tale with comic bits witty fantasy sequences and a wild horror film spoof about a disembodied foot.No doubt inspired by the Muddy Hand a disembodied hand in a film Kinney describes in another Wimpy book the foot film freaks Rowley and Greg out when Greg sneakily slips it in during one of their sleepovers. likely to make even younger viewers laugh.While Zach Gordons hapless but ever hopeful Greg remains the compelling heart of the tale Devon Bostick does a fine turn briefly revealing the vulnerable side to bullying big brother Rodrick. Rachael Harris also plays a key role this time as the well-meaning misguided mom whose plans to get the boys to bond actually work out -- just not the way shed planned.As befits Rowley Robert Capron keeps stealing every scene hes in with his earnest good will. And then theres a welcome debut by Peyton List as the idolized Holly Hills who in a nice twist turns out to be ... a nice girl. Shes a good fit for a nice family film that deserves to do just as well if not better than the first.Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick RulesB+ Starring Zachary Gordon Robert Capron Rachael Harris Devon Bostick and Steve Zahn.

"Battling bros perk up the Kid plot - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Battling bros perk up the Kid plotSequel a tick better than last Wimpy go-roundMarch 24 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticGreg Heffley (Zachary Gordon right) and best pal Rowley (Robert Capron) have an eventful sleepover in ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2.""Released a year ago the first ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" movie captured remarkably little of the sly charm of the Jeff Kinney books that line my sons bookshelf. The film did however capture enough of the fan base to warrant a sequel. And here we are. And its a little better. With ""Wimpy Kid I"" I couldnt get past the blech factor of snot mold and gross-out gags laid out flatly in a stilted live-action feature spiced with a few transitional animated sequences. Maybe Ive simply adjusted my expectations downward. But ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules"" whose subtitle refers to long-suffering protagonist Greg Heffleys tormenting older brother feels less pushy and more relaxed at least. I didnt laugh much nor did my 10-year-old companions but nobody had their soul crushed by the experience. This is the film industrys Hippocratic oath First crush no souls. Greg played by Zachary Gordon is heading into seventh grade in his overwhelmingly lily-white town. His pal Rowley (Robert Capron who has yet to discover a neutral expression; everything is either manic grinning or overt panicking) devotes his spare time to perfecting magic tricks for the community talent show. The surly dimwitted Rodrick played by Devon Bostick plays drums in his band (band name ""Loded Diper"") and has dreams of raging partying rock n roll glory. The Kinney books are episodic in the extreme and anecdotal in nature; the screenwriters on ""Wimpy Kid 2"" Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah have concocted a storyline in which Rodrick and Greg become enemies then uneasy allies then enemies then friends as Greg nurses a middle-school crush on the new girl (Peyton List). All the well-worn John Hughes stereotypes remain in force. ""Shes out of your league"" Gregs told. ""There is no way that girl will ever talk to you."" While I recognize the severe social stratification afflicting most every aspect of American life just once Id like to see a kid-aimed picture that doesnt proceed from the assumption that Character A is out of Character Bs league. Gordon and Bostick have settled into their roles nicely. Rachael Harris and Steve Zahn as the boys parents add solid vaguely human support. The film was directed by David Bowers who comes out of animation and was photographed by longtime Clint Eastwood associate Jack Green. Why the interiors look so cruddy is a mystery. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG (for some mild rude humor and mischief) Cast Zachary Gordon (Greg Heffley); Devon Bostick (Rodrick Heffley); Robert Capron (Rowley); Rachael Harris (Susan); Steve Zahn (Frank) Credits Directed by David Bowers; written by Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah based on the book by Jeff Kinney; produced by Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson.

""You jerk"" she says surveying the wreckage. Having read three out of the five books of Jeff Kinneys heavily illustrated hugely popular Wimpy Kid series aloud to my child Id be inclined to agree with her assessment. More often than not Greg Heffley is a jerk. But hes considerably less so in his cinematic incarnation than as the stick figure Kinney sketches. While reading I was often compelled to pause and point out to my young audience that no one should lie cheat misuse the English language or treat their best friend the way Greg does. Mainly because of his mean tendencies -- Greg is an older Calvin without the vulnerability of Hobbes -- I finally banned the books until my kid reaches a less impressionable age. But the big-screen Greg has grown on me even more so after this second film directed by David Bowers (Astro Boy). The first film used Gregs evolving relationship with his childhood best buddy Rowley (the appealing Robert Capron) a sweet innocent boy who still speaks enthusiastically and mortifyingly about how pretty his mom is as the narrative push for a story that otherwise is mostly about how mundane and miserable middle school is. After a rift Greg kind of sort of learned his lesson and now treats Rowley with a little more respect. The new film focuses on Greg coming to terms with his teenage older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick). A drummer in an awful heavy-metal garage band called Loded Diper Rodrick loves eyeliner and could sleep away the entire day if left to his own devices. Their parents Susan (Rachael Harris) and Frank (Steve Zahn) are not pushovers but theyre trusting and foolhardy enough to go away for the weekend with their 3-year-old and leave Greg and Rodrick to their own devices hoping to foster some brotherly bonding. Rodrick promptly hosts a raging party and locks Greg in the basement. Bostick who looks like a boy version of Juliette Lewis plays Rodrick with such an irresistibly ferocious energy that even the boys basic idiocy -- he spells door ""dore"" -- has a sort of charm about it. Actually the whole family is charming from Harris appealingly down-to-earth Mom to Zahns more skeptical Dad although from the way Zahn keeps opening his eyes wider and wider you wonder if he is trying to stay awake. Hed better; it seems likely this franchise will keep going although future filmmakers will have to move fast. Gordon in particular is growing like a weed. Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules is full of lively slapstick the best of which might be Gregs running through a nursing home in his underwear. There are nods to modernity including the incorporation of texting and uploading silly videos to YouTube but the movie never goes overboard with it. Susan for instance writes an advice column about raising boys but she does it for the local paper rather than a mommy blog. Theres something old-school about this view of American adolescence. Maybe thats why Rodrick Rules often feels like a mainstream version of that wonderful short-lived television series Freaks and Geeks. (Actually theres a better reason screenwriters Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah who wrote both the first film and this one are both producing and writing alums of the show.) That shows subtlety appears here as well despite the sitcom-style packaging. For instance when brotherly bonding does occur it is meted out carefully enough to feel uncontrived and as these things are a work in progress. And the perpetual danger of embarrassment that permeates junior high is very Freaks and Geeks. Gregs crush Holly Hills (Peyton List) passes him in the halls and calls out ""Hi Fregley."" He nods and keeps walking in quiet horror. Fregley (Grayson Russell) is the biggest loser in school. Holly thinks hes Fregley. The gym teacher has overheard. ""Thats gotta hurt"" he says as he passes Greg. It does. Its also good for a laugh. I might have banned the books but I wont do the same for the movies.

But shifting from the originals focus on the experiences of Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) at the ignored-runt end of middle school to domestic tyranny at the hands of his bullying big brother (Devon Bostick a fledgling Jeff Goldblum) is ill-advised. Out come the dusty old tropes Parents (Steve Zahn and Rachael Harris mugging obediently) take off for the weekend; place gets trashed; brothers bond over household repair; spend mishap-filled quality time with Grandpa; regress briefly; then re-bond. The truth is that the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series--a chain of comic-book vignettes brilliantly observed from the point of view of a hubris-laden pubescent--was never meant to be plotted or taken live. Director David Bowers (Flushed Away) working from a pretty good screenplay by Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah plows ahead valiantly but for far too long before the obligatory school-talent-show finale heaves into view. One consolation Robert Capron as the chubby best friend who insists on being a kindly kid instead of a media-savvy twerp.

Credit Diyah Pera/20th Century Fox ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" the first movie based on Jeff Kinneys illustrated childrens books was made on a shoestring and grossed 75 million. Hence the arrival in theaters a year later of ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules"" a sequel with ""straight to video"" written all over it. About the most you can say for it is that its inoffensive which isnt necessarily what you want in a movie about the humiliations of being a seventh grader with a bullying older brother.All of the main actors return for this forced and dreary-looking exercise directed by the animator David Bowers. Zachary Gordon and Robert Capron as the wimpy Greg and his best friend are charming and a few scenes have some energy like a slightly creepy sequence in which a naked Greg is trapped in the womens locker room at a retirement home. But the central story about Gregs hate-love relationship with his brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) is tired and utterly predictable.The usually entertaining Steve Zahn has nothing to do besides bug his eyes as the boys father but Rachael Harris as their dork-hottie awkwardly dancing mom manages something distinctive her imitation of Tina Feys Liz Lemon from ""30 Rock"" is so thorough that youll need no more convincing about Ms. Feys effect on early-21st-century popular culture.""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules"" is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested) for the occasional rude joke.DIARY OF A WIMPY KID RODRICK RULESOpens on Friday nationwide.

"Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick RulesNot much happens but the young cast charms.March 25 2011|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Zachary Gordon and Laine MacNeil in ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick... (Diyah Pera 20th Century...)A youth-centered franchise without superheroes magic or vampires is a rare thing these days which imbues the otherwise rudimentary ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules"" with a strange kind of burb-bound kid-powered charm. Hot on the heels of last years first movie foray into Jeff Kinneys rabidly popular book series the sequel dives headfirst into the turbulent dynamic between hapless undersized tween diary-keeper Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) and his too-cool-for-school older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) who seems to tolerate Greg only when torturing him. (Or we should say CIA-euphemistically using enhanced humiliation techniques). This is unfailingly modest comedy fuel for 12-year-olds adapted by screenwriters Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah with plenty of gross-out humor (chocolate stain meet seat of Gregs pants) the most threadbare of plots a anchored by Gregs crush on a popular new girl (Peyton List) and rock drummer Rodricks talent show dreams a and easy-to-swallow life lessons. Director David Bowers keeps things peppy and brightly lighted but the movies swiftest pleasures come from moment-seizing cast members Gordons cocksure mug melting in the face of indignity Bostick evoking devilish ennui Robert Caprons dorky hanger-on Rowley beaming with hopeless naivete or Rachael Harris and Steve Zahn a as the parents a giving comic spin to their put-upon boy wranglers.

Rodrick Rules The bro code | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRodrick Rules The bro codeThe Wimpy Kid is back and Greg Heffley is still leading the middle school nerd back with style.Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon right) and best pal Rowley (Robert Capron) having a sleepover.  (Diyah Pera / Handout)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. March 24 2011 Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules (out of 4) Starring Zachary Gordon Devon Bostick Robert Capron Rachael Harris and Steve Zahn. Directed by David Bowers. 94 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. G Whats worse than having a sarcastic tormenting bully of an older brother? Try being told by your mom that you two need to start bonding -- now. As Diary of a Wimpy Kids Greg Heffley would say hed rather endure The Cheese Touch. Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules follows last years surprise hit about the sixth-grade humiliations suffered by pint-sized everyboy Greg (Zachary Gordon) and his remarkably unsophisticated-yet-loyal best pal Rowley (Robert Capron). Based on the second of Jeff Kinneys graphic novel bestsellers the sequel takes the action to seventh grade and elevates older bro Rodrick (Torontos Devon Bostick) from major annoyance to co-star. While Bostick has considerable comic talents he looked too old for the part of a smug high schooler in the last movie. Now its getting ridiculous. Summer holiday is over and Greg is enjoying the satisfaction of moving up a notch in the middle school pecking order. Hes growing up -- hed like to catch the eye of that new girl Holly Hills (Peyton List) a dead ringer for Barbie and a cool cutie on the roller rink floor. Meanwhile Rodrick continues to work on his rock-star chops as the drummer for Loded Diper (thats Loaded Diaper -- so spelling isnt his strong suit; hes a creative genius and has discovered Keith Richards-like eyeliner). But the course of Grade 7 life never did run smooth for Greg. Sometimes your older brother lets you sit on chocolate so the whole congregation at church thinks you pooped your pants. Or he locks you in the basement when you finally get a chance to go to a teenager party. Or he strands you outside your grandfathers retirement residence in your underpants. The escalating bro wars lead their parents (Steve Zahn and Rachael Harris the ultimate second bananas in this kid-flick world) to lay down the law and demand the two make peace and -- even worse -- be friends. The smart dialogue and kids-eye-view of the torments of school life remain as satisfyingly amusing as the first outing but this Wimpy Kid is slightly off-kilter. Maybe its the fault of the storyline putting so much emphasis on Rodrick which takes the spotlight away from Gregs more goofily amusing world. Nobody in Rodricks posse lovingly inserts cheese puffs into his nostrils for laughs like red-headed nerd prince Fregley (Grayson Russell). Director Thor Freudenthal has been replaced with David Bowers (Astro Boy Flushed Away) who moves from the animation department to the human side of filmmaking for the first time. Its not a completely cartoon-free zone; Kinneys minimalist illustrations are used throughout the movie to good effect. As usual Greg has to decide whether his loyalties are to his pals -- especially poor Rowley who has decided he has promise as a magician -- or self-preservation. At the same time he finds himself reluctantly bonding with Rodrick over a shared secret and the discovery of the awesome powers of plastic vomit. The characters remain a delightful mix of lovable losers tattletales and schemers and its a rare movie where the only thing the teens get into at a raucous party are litres of pop and tossing rolls of toilet paper into the trees on the front lawn. These kinds of innocent pursuits cant last -- kids grow up and so will the cast.

At school Greg is not remarkable enough for the cool seventh graders and not eccentric enough for the geeks. In terms of height and popularity he ranks about 50 in a class of 55.In short (pun intended) Greg is radiantly average.He is the relatable title character of Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2 Rodrick Rules the sunny if sitcommy sequel to the first in the franchise based on Jeff Kinneys beloved books.This time around Gregs well-meaning mother (Rachael Harris) encourages her older sons to become friends. She is the only person on the planet who fails to recognize that Rodrick (Devon Bostick) gets his power from pranking Greg.Directed by David Bowers DOWK 2 (funny how that acronym looks like ""dork"") better integrates the books distinctive stick-figure cartoons with the live-action episodes of brotherly hate.Buffeted between brothers between cliques and between parents who still treat him like a toddler Greg (Zachary Gordon who has the Everyboy appeal of Jerry Mathers Beaver Cleaver) struggles to find his place.He listens when his friends tell him that Holly Hills (Peyton List) the pretty new girl in seventh grade is out of his league. And then Greg like every middle schooler throughout history wonders exactly which league he is in.His story is told with considerable charm if perhaps too many poop jokes for one not a 13-year-old boy. (Rodricks headbanger band is called LAPded Diper.)Unlike the first film which was broader and more episodic this one has a narrative throughline. The more Mom pushes the boys together the more they butt heads. And the funnier it gets. Heres a tween comedy you dont have to be a tween to enjoy.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint With approximately 50 million copies of his ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" graphic novels in circulation Jeff Kinney has a loyal following of readers whove outgrown Dr. Seuss but arent ready for Harry Potter. The arrival of the second live-action ""Wimpy Kid"" movie will give them and indulgent parents something to do on a rainy Saturday afternoon. The movie which lacks much of the mischievous subversive appeal of last years debut film plays directly to the middle-school set. The antihero of the series is Greg Heffley a put-upon 12-year-old who sees his life as an unending series of humiliations. Hes a bit of a whiner and a jerk but always shows a sympathetic human side and we relate and forgive him because weve all been there. The original film caught the self-pitying humor of the situation as Greg dumped his oafish loyal best friend Rowley to impress the cool kids and cowered before older brother Rodrick a heavy-metal lunkhead. Greg got himself into embarrassing scrapes by putting on airs and life lessons about humility were delivered without a lot of stuffy lecturing. ""Rodrick Rules"" softens Gregs character considerably. Hes no longer an endearing sarcastic jerk just endearing. Except for one running joke about giving an even wimpier classmate the cold shoulder Greg is presented as a standard-issue nice kid who is often in over his head. His engaging cockiness gone hes just a passive reactive pipsqueak -- the kiss of death for a protagonist. Parents wont find much to raise a smile here but the point of attending such movies is seeing your children crack up. Most likely they will especially if they favor poop gags which abound. In this installment Mom insists that the squabbling siblings spend more time together. This leads to mild high jinks with hard-partying high schoolers; rehearsals with Rodricks rock band Loded Diper; a prank-filled evening at the convenience store and a weekend spent in exile at grandpas retirement community. While there Greg squirms his way through one of the films more amusing crises as hes trapped half-naked in a lavatory full of old women in swimsuits. Wholesome moral instruction is ladled on as Greg learns not to cheat in school tell fibs or duck out on a friend in need. Most of the original actors return with Zachary Gordon twinkling a little too hard as Greg Devon Bostick as his troublesome brother and Robert Capron as the ever-cheerful Rowley. Rachael Harris (""The Hangover"") and Steve Zahn are intentionally corny and irritating as Mom and Dad. Missing from the film is young Chloe Moretz one of the highlights of the original who has graduated to bigger roles in better movies. The rest of the cast members look and act as if theyve been held back and made to repeat a grade.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Ah yes the ebb and flow of young brotherhood. Bitterest of sibling rivals one week; and the next week buds through and through. In ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules the second movie adapted from Jeff Kinneys kid-lit phenomenon thats the theme the filmmakers actively build up in their usual effort to structure (read Hollywoodize) the books anecdotal storytelling. Fortunately they also recognize the preaching their audience ultimately wants to hear the kind that gets disrupted at church when smart-alecky everykid Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) shows up with an unfortunate stain on his Sunday khakis.An uninspired roller-rink opener stirs some fretting that its just going to be the same go-round from the sequels returning writers and new director David Bowers (an animation vet as hinted by the more prominent doodled snippets here). Gregs dorky BFF Rowley (Robert Capron) spouts his ""Zoo-wee Mama catchphrase; weird Fregley (Grayson Russell) whos not even in book two delivers more gross-outs. But its quickly made clear that Greg and friends do have a slightly new attitude -- hey theyre seventh graders now -- and the more pressing wackier issues are at home between Greg and punky older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick).Eager to promote a little togetherness the boys mom (Rachael Harris) encourages Rodrick to drive Greg home from school (amusingly and bruisingly in the junker Rodrick uses to haul equipment for his garage band Loded Diper.) She suggests Rodrick give Greg drumming lessons (which go about as expected when the tutor drums for a band called well Loded Diper). In the end what the brothers really bond over is covering up the party Rodrick throws while their parents are away. When the secret inevitably gets out Mom and Dad (Steve Zahn) get tough banning Rodrick from the upcoming school talent show -- and setting up a memorably cutting line from Bostick among other bits of surprisingly legit emotional resonance.The movie toggles between feeling the need to reconcile Gregs cartoony world with the real one and blithely obliviously doing just the opposite. The pivotal mice-will-play rager at the Heffleys is awkwardly falsely PG from cola-filled keg cups to Rowleys conga line. (And then the filmmakers want to toss off a pix-of-shame slide show a la ""The Hangover) At the same time they skillfully tweak a scene from the book in which Greg gets caught in a womens restroom placing the joke more squarely on him. Instantly the scene turns from odd -- accused-perv humor can be tricky that way -- into the big comic moment Kinney obviously was after.Credit Bowers and company finally for making some good calls about where to follow the leads furnished to them by the book and the first movie and where to get creative. Why go back to the ""cheese touch comedy well when you can spend screen time say taking Kinneys passing reference to a generic horror flick and turning it into . . . ""The Foot? Cootie jokes or a stinky reanimated foot in the face -- its all good fun for the kids.Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Jeff Kinneys popular ""visual novel"" series Diary Of A Wimpy Kid converts a preteen boys everyday traumas into a charming combination of stick-figure sketchbook and irreverent running commentary. Adapting them for live-action features is trickier than it seems partly because of the books episodic nature and partly because these journals are the boys cartoon-y vision of the abuse he weathers at home and at school. The first Diary Of A Wimpy Kid movie fell into both traps lurching forward on disconnected bits of slapstick and gross-out gags and making real-world grotesquerie out of its heros crude sketches. The sequel Diary Of A Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules isnt motivated to change the formula in the least but its ever-so-slightly more palatable if only for being less of a total spazz. Looking just as undersized and feckless as he did a year ago Zachary Gordon returns as the picked-on diarist who hopes that seventh grade will treat him better than sixth. Though he hangs out with the geek crowd--his best friend (Robert Capron) is a portly outcast who wants to be a magician and another buddy is so obnoxious that the entire class pretends like hes invisible--Gordon dreams of advancement in the middle-school caste system. His ticket might be a sweet-natured blonde girl (Peyton List) whos too new to the school to recognize his dweeb status but even with her he isnt the smoothest operator. At home Gordons biggest problem is his older brother Devon Bostick who bullies him relentlessly and all the more when their mother (Rachael Harris) demands they spend more quality time together. Making the sibling conflict the focus of Rodrick Rules gives Diary Of A Wimpy Kid more direction than its predecessor though not necessarily more credibility or insight; the epic spats and bonding sessions between Gordon and Bostick are all so rigorously calculated they squeeze out the possibility of fresh observations. Most of the jokes involve Gordon humiliating himself in front of a crowd whether dashing through a retirement home in his underwear or delivering his brothers old ""F"" paper as an oral presentation. He seems doomed to live out a different worst-nightmare scenario every day until he gets through puberty. Its hard not to watch the Wimpy Kid movies through webbed fingers.

Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules Bad to fair Director David Bowers. Cast Zachary Gordon Devon Bostick Robert Capron. Rating PG for some mild rude humor and mischief. Guide to this weeks new releases Kids books that became movies OK thats faint praise. Last years ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" based on Jeff Kinneys enormously popular childrens book series was awful a mean-spirited affair with misguided energy that was more likely to produce a bitter aftertaste than a laugh or even a chuckle. But Zachary Gordon returns for the sequel as Greg Heffley and this time around hes much more the put-upon middle brother than the arrogant brat he was in the first film. Perhaps its a new director - David Bowers who directed the animated features ""Astro Boy"" and ""Flushed Away"" takes over for Thor Freudenthal - or maybe its just a better story. Mind you its still not all that great but at least this time around lessons are learned and yes there occasionally is something to laugh at. Greg is now a seventh-grader more confident yet less arrogant. Hes still best friends with Rowley (Robert Capron) the chubby friend he betrayed in the last film in an ill-fated bid for popularity. And he has his sights set on hanging out with the new girl at school Holly Hills (Peyton List). Things are looking up. Except for Rodrick his older brother and to a lesser extent Manny his younger one. Twins Owen and Connor Fielding are adorable as Manny but Devon Bostick again plays Rodrick as some sort of psychopath tormenting and humiliating Greg just because he can. Typical older-brother stuff sure but theres a meanness to it thats off-putting. To make matters worse their mom (Rachael Harris) has decided that they need to spend more time together something neither brother has any interest in. Events will of course conspire to force the issue and eventually Greg and Rodrick do bond a bit over things like tricking people with fake vomit and cheating on class assignments. But the difficulty of keeping a secret will prove too much putting into jeopardy Rodricks future with his band Loded Diper. Which would be a shame. Or not. Steve Zahn once again has too little to do as Gregs dad; Harris fares better. Gordon is much more likable this time around but Capron still is the best of the bunch. He gives Rowley - a budding magician in this installment devoted to the craft - a dignity lacking in just about every other character. As for Greg at least this time he really is wimpy not pathetic. Well take progress wherever we can find it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

TWITTER Unfortunately this time the Wimpy Kid somewhat offbeat and even witty in the original film more than earns his name. Whatever happened to the Wimpy Kid? A year after the original film surprised adults by being a kids movie with a degree of wit a sequel arrives Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules that ispositively wimpy. The blame settles pretty evenly across all the force fields of a studio movie production -- producers who evidently didnt understand the success of the original writers who rushed through a half-baked screenplay and a new director whose ham-fisted direction throws nearly every scene out of kilter. The good will generated by the original film which was also based on Jeff Kinneys series of animated novels about middle-school life will ensure a winning theatrical launch. But word about its wimpy-ness will seep out fast enough over social networks so Fox shouldnt anticipate anything close to the box-office success of the original. The charm of the first film lay in the rather cool attitude of its diarist -- pre-teen Greg Heffley who maintains his journal against the day when his own fame will create a desperate need for information about his early years -- and his acute observations about the hierarchy of popularity that dominates school life. The movies missteps mostly came in his home life with parents who seemed more juvenile than him and an older brother whose bullying quickly became a tedious running gag. Well guess what? The sequel is all about Gregs home life his inane parents and yes that bratty brother. This time tedium sets in early and never loosens its grip. The gags are obvious predictable and dull while the characters have been stripped of all life thanks to the filmmakers determination to stress quirks over behavior. Zachary Gordon a young actor who continues to show promise even in this forlorn affair returns as Greg more confident now that hes graduated to the seventh grade but still full of anxiety this time over the appearance of a new girl in school the lovely Holly Hills (Peyton List) who everyone assures him is out of his league. Only the thing is Greg is never certain to what league he actually belongs. Had the movie pursued with more vigor a storyline involving Gregs first crush it may have had some life. But this unfortunately is a mere subplot in a story dominated by the growing hostility between Greg and his older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick). The latters incessant harassment along with his casual delinquency edges the movie into the uncomfortable area of pathological behavior whether intended or not. Even worse though mom and dad again the luckless Rachael Harris and Steve Zahn are so lame that the adult actors are forced to mug their way through nearly every scene. Gabe Sachs amp; Jeff Judah one of the two writing teams from the original film run through a series of tepid and trite gags involving roller-rinks school hijinks and a horror film viewed on a sleepover that gives Greg and best pal Rowley (Robert Capron) nightmares. Animator David Bowers (Flushed Away Astro Boy) making his live-action feature debut directs as if he were still making cartoons. Gesture and facial expression are invariably too big and character behavior hugely exaggerated. The whole movie is pitched to the Peanut Gallery so ruthlessly that any possibility of whimsy or charm is crushed like a bug at a picnic. The jokey music and limp production values on this Vancouver-based production dont help matters.

Endearing underdog hero Greg Heffley returns for another year of middle-school humiliation in ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules"" capitalizing on the sleeper success of the 2010 kidpic before puberty has a chance to render runt-sized Zachary Gordon any less wimpy. Quickie adaptation of Jeff Kinneys second novel -- which centers on big brother Rodricks ongoing torture of the seventh-grade weakling -- blends ""Brady Bunch""-style morality with other standard-issue sitcom tropes then redeems itself via memorable supporting characters. Its hardly Harry Potter but even without wizards or vampires Fox clearly has a healthy young-adult franchise on its hands. The remarkable thing about the original ""Wimpy Kid"" was the fact that it didnt take the lazy route of manufacturing a nemesis for its titular outcast but instead allowed Greg to learn from his own mistakes the way real adolescents inevitably must even if it meant recognizing its self-absorbed hero as something of a jerk. This much safer follow-up feels far less subversive falling back on stock coming-of-age devices including bully Rodrick (Devon Bostick) out-of-his-league love interest Holly (Peyton List) and a school talent show where everything comes to a head. With the exception of Chloe Moretz busy making ""Hugo Cabret"" with Martin Scorsese all the key players are back which makes for nice continuity as ""Wimpy Kid"" opens at the start of a new school year with a retro roller-skating party for incoming seventh graders. True to Kinneys books screenwriters Gabe Sachs and Jeff Judah recognize that nothing is more intimidating to todays teens than the prospect of public embarrassment a fear they exploit by repeatedly putting Greg in situations where he risks widespread ridicule wearing Speedos to swim practice being babied by his parents in front of Holly getting trapped outdoors in nothing but his underwear and so on. Adolescence is humiliating enough without someone actively tormenting you but Greg has it especially rough with Rodrick dreaming up creative pranks to antagonize his brother. (Equally crafty younger sibling Manny played by twins Owen and Connor Fielding takes a backseat in this chapter of the series.) Gregs well-meaning mother (Rachael Harris) and mostly clueless father (Steve Zahn barely tapping his comedic potential) try to remedy the situation by forcing their sons to spend quality time together. While the parents are away the boys throw an illicit house party -- a ridiculously PG-appropriate affair characterized by soda chugging and conga lines -- that results in some genuine bonding before Greg spills the beans. In the lead Gordon has the wide-eyed appeal of a young Matthew Broderick He looks nothing like Kinneys crudely rendered cartoon character but makes the mischievous character likable even when his often-inconsiderate actions invite reproach. Its thanks to Gordon that younger auds can identify with the character while ""Wimpy Kid"" soft-sells the sort of behavioral lessons parents appreciate. Pics animation demands are minimal an artifact of the storys first-person diary device allowing ""Astro Boy"" helmer David Bowers to demonstrate his live-action chops. He gets mostly solid perfs from his young ensemble though the characters feel more two-dimensional this time around clearly doomed to sitcom-style supporting status in this and future installments. Bostick is just silly enough to sell the goofily rebellious Rodrick while List looks pretty as the otherwise personality-bereft blonde Holly. Since production values are only modestly better than TV Fox might as well rush to adapt the rest of Kinneys ""Wimpy Kid"" series while the cast is still scrawny enough to fit the bill.
