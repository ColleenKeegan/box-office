ABOUT THE MOVIECity of Ember  1/2 (out of four)Stars Bill Murray Tim Robbins Harry Treadaway Saoirse Ronan Martin Landau Mary Kay Place Marianne Jean-BaptisteDirector Gil KenanDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG for mild peril and some thematic elementsRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY City of Ember is at its best when sticking to a classic sci-fi-fantasy format. But when it tries to be a generic thrill ride it loses its originality and peculiar charm. Ember is a dark post-apocalyptic underground world powered by a massive generator and built to sustain itself in the wake of an unnamed cataclysmic event. CLIP Travel to the City of Ember Citizens are made to feel fortunate to have found such refuge. Glittering lights are strung all over the city and a single greenhouse offers a semblance of fresh vegetables. Without the aid of the sun what emerges is puny misshapen and barely recognizable. People subsist mostly on dusty cans of food and old-fashioned human decency encouraged by a smarmy and corrupt mayor (Bill Murray). Denizens struggle to keep a sense of humanity alive with song bolstered by a belief that ""the builders"" who created the city will come back to save them. A few including the inventor Loris Harrow (Tim Robbins) grow withdrawn disillusioned by the faltering society. An underlying sense of despair takes hold as the generator grows increasingly faulty and blackouts are more frequent. A few brave souls venture out into the darkest regions outside the city limits with disastrous consequences. Loris son Doon (Harry Treadaway) and Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) are teenagers who have been arbitrarily assigned jobs. In the process they stumble on a possible escape from their claustrophobic world. Because the city is so dark insects that thrive in the nether regions grow larger than normal. For some reason the most labyrinthine parts of the underground society are terrorized by a huge red-tentacled mole. Its probably wise that the filmmakers didnt conceive of hordes of such creatures but this monstrous animal feels like a leftover from some sci-fi thriller. City of Ember based on a popular childrens book has some strong fantasy moments and makes a gentle statement about corruption and blind faith. The supporting cast is strong and the two young leads are capable if bland. Some of the action feels padded. But when the film focuses on the two curious and courageous young people struggling to understand their mysterious environs it works. Even if it occasionally goes off course City of Ember provides audiences with a thought-provoking and family-friendly adventure.

"City of Ember Underground film | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentCity of Ember Underground filmWith each day bringing news of fresh disasters - environmental economic and geo-political - the premise of City of Ember seems less fanciful and more futuristic.By Susan WalkerEntertainment ReporterFri. Oct. 10 2008 Starring Bill Murray Tim Robbins Harry Treadaway and Saoirse Ronan. Directed by Gil Kenan. Written by Caroline Thompson based on the novel by Jeanne DuPrau. 95 minutes. At major theatres. PG  With each day bringing news of fresh disasters - environmental economic and geo-political - the premise of City of Ember seems less fanciful and more futuristic.Article Continued BelowAdapting Jeanne DuPraus critically praised young adult novel of 2003 director Gil Kenan (Monster House) and screenwriter Caroline Thompson (Corpse Bride Edward Scissorhands) have fashioned a film about a post-apocalyptic underground city that is tinged with an appropriate degree of realism.The teenage protagonists of City of Ember Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) and Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan from Atonement) are not such far-fetched characters. Their parents and grandparents generations are living in Ember in blind faith that the lights will stay on as long as theyre alive. Doon and Lina would like to imagine a future beyond Ember.The Builders created Ember when the world ended and all turned to darkness. The underground city is home to the last remnants of humankind. In a box entrusted to the mayor are the secret instructions for what to do after 200 years when the huge generator that keeps the lights on in Ember is bound to fail. But the box has been lost. It is 241; there are daily blackouts and food is running out. The corrupt mayor of Ember (Bill Murray) has a survival plan for himself. (Mayor Cole is one of Murrays supremely ironic performances.) As the pipes are bursting and the lights fading he announces to the citizenry ""not just an answer but a solution"" a special task force. Doon decides to take matters into his own hands. On assignment day when youngsters pull job descriptions out of a hat he traded his messenger job for Linas pipe works assignment.He goes hunting for an entrance to the generator and finds evidence that the people are being robbed of their food stores. When Lina discovers a mysterious box with some tattered instructions inside they join up to find an exit out of Ember. An A-list cast all of them acting in a very stylized fashion brings Thompsons no-nonsense script to life with some amusing touches. Tim Robbins plays Doons father a hare-brained slightly mad inventor who has given up hope for a fix for Ember.Toby Jones (Truman Capote in Infamous) is Barton Snode the mayors officious aide. Martin Landau plays sleepy old Sul Doons co-worker in the pipe works and an unexpected hero. Mackenzie Crook (Pirates of the Caribbean) does a mean-looking turn as Looper who does the mayors dirty work.Production design is crucial here Ember is a city that looks like a Disney-fied museum of the industrial revolution. Everything is worn out creaking and groaning. Sparks fly and gears burst as Ember approaches doomsday. The giant mole and moth arent bad either although no explanation is offered for their mutant forms. City of Ember is a thrilling adventure tale and teen fantasy that is grounded in real concerns about who is managing the planet.

Saoirse Ronan left and Harry Treadaway are shown in a scene from ""City of Ember."" Photo Walden Media Twentieth Century Fox Who turned out the lights? Dark secrets from below 1 / 1 Back to Gallery City of Ember Fantasy. Starring Bill Murray Tim Robbins Harry Treadaway and Saoirse Ronan. Directed by Gil Kenan. (PG. 95 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Movies are planned months and years in advance and yet its not uncommon for films to arrive that speak directly to the thoughts and fears of the particular moment. Perhaps this shouldnt be surprising Just as a person expresses the unconscious in dreams a culture expresses its unconscious in movies. And so today just as everyone is on edge about the global economic crisis (and no one has forgotten 9/11) were getting movies about civic catastrophe about civilizations absolutely and completely falling apart. Last week it was ""Blindness"" a well-made and unsettling film in which millions of people suddenly lose their sight. Today we get ""City of Ember"" an impressive and imaginative fantasy about human beings who live in an underground city two centuries after a nuclear war. They have no knowledge of the earths surface. They know nothing about the world that went before them. For them Ember is the entire world - and that world is about to go to pieces. If you want to look for a metaphor the search wont be long. The elders who established Ember gave it 200 good years. They gave it a generator and enough food to last two centuries but now time has run out. The pipes are rusting. Food is scarce. Most ominous the generator on which the entire civilization depends has started to stall. Two or three times a week it just stops functioning for a few seconds causing all the electricity to go out. ""City of Ember"" has an emotional impact that goes way beyond a clever metaphor. In an early scene a chipper young messenger (Saoirse Ronan) is making her way through the town square when the generator stalls again - and this time for longer than ever before. The people are so relieved and so willing to believe that maybe it wont happen again that the moment is touching. Its also rather touching that their world is such a pathetic echo of real civilization that their sky is just a bunch of lightbulbs and that their religion has something to do with waiting for ""the builders"" to return. Yet they want to hold on to what they have. The tone of ""City of Ember"" is flexible enough to allow for both drama and satire with neither feeling discordant. Bill Murray plays the mayor a complete phony who is looking for a way to escape Ember even as he is announcing ""a task force to investigate the blackouts."" It wont surprise anyone to know that Murray is funny in the role - hes funny just sitting at his desk with a deadpan expression. But he goes deeper. For example take the moment in which hes walking onto a balcony to address a throng of citizens who idolize him. Just as hes about to reveal himself to the masses he assumes a look of theatrical geniality thats so unnatural and bizarre and yet so calculated to please that its chilling to see. For a split second that face actually scared me. Though Murray makes the most of his scenes and Tim Robbins has a nice featured role as an inventor the film focuses mainly on the adventures of two teenagers who gradually come to discover the City of Embers founding secrets. The young actors Ronan (""Atonement"") and Harry Treadaway couldnt be better. If you have any reservations about going to a movie starring two teenagers put them aside. Also if the thought of a movie that takes place underground holds little appeal think again. The films design is not murky and shadowy but rich and bright and the whole rendering of this underground world is fascinating. Ive said almost nothing about the story. Good. Ill let you discover it. But just two general comments The pacing is varied but energetic and for that you can credit director Gil Kenan (""Monster House""). And the story based on Jeanne Dupraus novel of the same name is beautifully constructed. It builds until it reaches the point that its one edge-of-your-seat moment after another. All this and you wont have to check your brain at the door either. ""City of Ember"" offers a rich reward on a modest 95-minute investment. -- AdvisoryMoments of menace and a scary monster but otherwise this is pretty wholesome entertainment.

"City of Ember | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; city-of-ember ) City of Ember (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli City of Ember has almost anything one could want from a science fiction-based family adventure film likeable characters an imaginative setting and a fast pace. The third item on that list is notable. Recognizing that children often have limited attention spans the filmmakers have endeavored to keep City of Ember moving. Exposition when needed is delivered briskly and with a minimum of irrelevant information. Dialogue rarely accomplishes anything beyond advancing the plot. The almost complete absence of transition scenes results in a flow that is occasionally choppy. Overall however City of Ember will find favor with older children and their parents. The film takes place more than 200 years in the future. Ember is an underground city that was developed to provide sanctuary for the last of the human race after a catastrophe wiped out the inhabitants of the surface of the planet. Now after two centuries Embers infrastructure is beginning to fail. The generator that provides light heat and air to the city is experiencing frequent breakdowns. The water supply pipelines are springing leaks. The huge food storehouses are almost barren. And morale is at an all-time low. Two children - Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) and Doon Harrow (Harry Treadway) - have become Embers self-appointed saviors. Lina is a messenger and Doon is a pipe repairman and both recognize that the city is in jeopardy. Following cryptic clues Lina and Doon determine that the path to salvation leads to the outside world. But its not as simple as opening a secret door. The builders of Ember didnt want the inhabitants leaving before an appointed time so they safeguarded the route to the surface. Its up to Lina and Doon to unravel the puzzle. The closer they get to the truth however the more dangerous they become to the citys corrupt mayor (Bill Murray) who determines they must be arrested lest they endanger a personal nest-egg he is feathering. Aspects of City of Ember make it seem like a futuristic version of National Treasure where the prize is the survival of the human race. The things that made the Nicolas Cage adventure so popular - finding clues and decoding puzzles - are in evidence here although the running around doesnt seem quite as repetitious and pointless. The climactic 15 minutes involve a lot of action sequences and there are times when it almost seems as if they have been designed with a future amusement park ride in mind. Director Gil Kenans (Monster House) vision of Ember is inventive. The city is a cramped claustrophobic place that owes a little to George Orwell and a little more to Terry Gilliam. The technology is a mix of pre-computer 50s and 60s engineering with gears and motors dominating. The color palette is dominated by browns and other dull colors as a way of emphasizing how dreary life has become within what was once a technological marvel. There are also times when Ember feels like some kind of gigantic Rube Goldberg contraption where it takes an exceedingly complicated number of steps to arrive at a relatively straightforward objective. The films stars are a pair of lesser-known actors whose careers are in ascent. Saoirse Ronan by virtue of her Best Supporting Actress nomination for Atonement is the higher profile of the two. She exhibits command of both her character and her American accent (despite being born in New York City she was raised in Ireland) and imbues Lina with an optimism and energy that are infectious. Harry Treadway is not yet well known in the United States but he has the looks and poise for that to change. The supporting cast is dotted with familiar names Bill Murray as Embers mayor; Tim Robbins as Doons father; Martin Landau as Doons mentor; and Mary Kay Place as a woman who takes in Lina and her young sister when their grandmother dies. Although City of Ember has been crafted with a family audience in mind there are a few scenes that might be deemed too frightening for smaller children. The underground passages of Ember are home to a giant mole-like creature and scenes of it chasing the protagonists could be nightmare fodder for younger more sensitive boys and girls. Other than that however theres nothing objectionable about the films content. And unlike many post-apocalyptic stories this one is built upon a foundation of hope not despair. Those looking for thought-provoking material wont find it here but as a well-paced adventure with sci-fi overtones its a good excuse to spend 90 minutes in a multiplex auditorium.

"Movie review City of Ember -- 4 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review City of Ember -- 4 out of 5 stars For generations the people of the City of Ember have flourished in an amazing world of glittering lights - underground. But Embers once powerful generator is failing. Now in a race against time the citizens must search Ember for clues that will unlock the mystery of the citys existence and escape before the lights go out forever. Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic Heads up all you tweens out there in Lets Go to the Moviesland. Todays word is ""dystopia"" as in the opposite of ""utopia"" often used to describe works of science fiction that depict an Earth that has been polluted (Blade Runner) globally warmed (Waterworld) or Big Brotherd (1984) into slavery. City of Ember is a not-quite-classic addition to the genre a dystopia that gets away with being derivative and somewhat prone to trite ""thrill ride"" action sequences. It could be the first dystopia many a tween or early teen moviegoer experiences a movie about teenagers trying to save the human race. ""On the day the world ended"" a narrator tells us learned men in blue lab coats sent the last vestiges of the human race below ground to hold out for 200 years in the City of Ember. But those 200 years have passed. Knowledge has faded and the vast city is crumbling degenerating as generations have grown up not really understanding how anything works why theyre underground or what was supposed to happen after 200 years.The canned food supplies are running out. The generator that runs the lights is flickering. ""Time"" as the ticking clock we hear tells us ""is running out."" Whom do you turn to? The Mayor ( Bill Murray) is a corrupt empty suit ruling by tacit fear of the unknown (""Ours is the only light in a dark world"") and promising to have a ""task force"" look into the generator problem. The religious just smile and sing their hymn ""This is all we know"" as the lights dim.But Lina (Saoirse Ronan of Atonement) and Doon (Harry Treadaway of Control) arent giving up or accepting the official government line. She delves into the mystery of a missing box of instructions for the city. And Doon the son of a tinkerer ( Tim Robbins) ignores his aged ""its not my job"" boss in the pipe works ( Martin Landau) and tries to get to the generator to have a crack at fixing it.In a just universe City of Ember would settle in as an instant cult film the sci-fi movie you show kids to teach them science fiction. The set a vast subterranean Dickensian tenement is fascinating in its detail. Kids who have outgrown but seen Bee Movie and Flushed Away may connect to this depressing but complete world where your job-for-life is picked from a hat on ""assignment day.""This dark and ambitiously simple adaptation of the Jeanne Duprau novel by the great screenwriter Caroline Thompson (Edward Scissorhands) is both light entertainment and smart subversive literature urging the young to think for themselves question authority and make their own destiny. An ending that doesnt deliver a punch or a surprise notwithstanding City of Ember is still good enough to turn on a new generation of sci-fi fans on to the glories of movie dystopias films that warn us of how things might turn out if we dont change our ways.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday October 9 2008 1128 AM Dark in virtually every sense of the word ""City of Ember"" seems an unlikely entry in the race for allowance money. But surely there are tweens unimpressed by the talking dogs of ""Beverly  Hills Chihuahua."" If you happen to know some send them this way. The titular metropolis is a self-contained underground world created to preserve the human race in the face of threats against mankind. Enough time has passed that no one even remembers the outside a fact exploited by the corrupt mayor (Bill Murray). Rumors have spread that certain death faces those who leave assuming they dont get caught and thrown in jail first. RELATED BILL MURRAY LOOKS FOR RENEWAL AFTER DIVORCE Unfortunately Ember isnt exactly the kind of place anyone would choose to call home. Power outages are common poverty is rampant and food supplies are dwindling to nearly nothing. The adults (like Mary Kay Place and Martin Landau) have been scared into submission. But at least two teens Lina (Saoirse Ronan) and Doon (Harry Treadaway) are determined to escape. Doons dad (Tim Robbins) once made the attempt so he knows how dangerous it is. There are monsters to contend with a suspicious mayor to distract and a code that must be broken. If anything at all goes wrong the kids fates will be grim. ""Grim"" is not typically a word youd associate with a family film. But fans of Jeanne DuPraus sci-fi novel will be happy to know director Gil Kenan (""Monster House"") remains faithful to her books serious tone. The city is a bleak dystopia the grownups cant all be counted on and the children have to rely on their own intelligence and strength rather than luck. And yet there is an undimmed light at the center of this story thanks to the resourcefulness of its young protagonists. Things do move too slowly in the middle which sets up an unnecessarily rushed finale. But Ronan (an Oscar nominee for ""Atonement"") makes an especially lovely heroine. And though the film ultimately falls short of its considerable promise theres more than enough here to keep thoughtful moviegoers - of any age - intrigued.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune October 10 2008 -- 453pm  Associated Press - Ap In this image released by Twentieth Century Fox and Walden Media Saoirse Ronan left and Harry Treadaway are shown in a scene from ""City of Ember."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint With the current ""End of Times"" vibe shrouding the nation like a throbbing migraine ""City of Ember"" debuts at an apt moment. This postapocalyptic adventure for kids takes place in a decaying subterranean community established after a catastrophe has forced humanitys survivors underground. (view movie showtimes) Over 200-plus years the inhabitants grew complacent. Now the food supply is depleted the generator powering the outpost is failing the lights are dimming and the corrupt harebrained elders have lost the instructions explaining how to return to Earths surface. Sounds vaguely familiar. Through the generations life in Ember has grown repressive and routine. When they reach the age of responsibility youngsters are assigned their careers by the mayor (Bill Murray) a popular but lazy cynic. Lina (Saoirse Ronan the young star of ""Atonement"") becomes a messenger. Her pal Doon (Harry Treadaway) eager to work on the failing generator can do no better than apprenticing in the pipe works repairing the citys decrepit plumbing alongside his ancient drowsy mentor Sul (Martin Landau). When Lina discovers a time capsule in her grandmothers house she thinks it contains the secrets to saving the city. Or it would if little sister Poppy (the adorable Amy Quinn) hadnt used the exit directions for teething. Puzzling out the partial clues that remain the friends face natural perils and nefarious adversaries on their quest to save the dying Ember. Almost every aspect of the film works on a high level no surprise given that its lead producer is Tom Hanks. Gil Kenan director of the hugely enjoyable animated family comedy ""Monster House"" makes a smooth transition to live action with this splendidly cast intelligent graphically inventive romp. CITY OF EMBER  1/2 OUT OF FOUR STARS; RATING PG FOR MILD PERIL AND SOME THEMATIC ELEMENTS. Screenwriter Caroline Thompson (""Edward Scissorhands"") working from Jeane Dupraus popular 2003 young adult novel captures the timeless otherworldly quality of a classic fantasy. Its story of two appealing preadolescent heroes who save the day should thrill children and delight their parents. Its provocative but never preachy and packed full of comic invention. Murrays entrance is a classic. Smiling with the lackadaisical self-regard of a pasha he ambles onscreen while his errand boy (Toby Jones ""The Mist"") scuttles behind him holding an awning-shaped parasol over the great mans head. Its like a scene from Dr. Seuss brought to life. Murrays speeches to the adoring citizenry (""We stand united against the darkness"") are a droll spin on the fatuous boosterism weve heard throughout the campaign season. While many of the films delights will sail over the heads of the preteen demographic there are exciting chase scenes aplenty and roller-coaster getaways filmed with slam-bang gusto. If the film performs as well as it ought to at the box office well be seeing both a sequel and a theme park ride by next year.

""The Builders"" who created the haven are long gone. And their cryptic instructions about what to do in case of an emergency are tucked away.

But two quiet rebels have an urgent sense of their burgs dwindling resources. Talking bout my g-g-generator. . . . Based on Jeanne DuPraus young- adult novel ""City of Ember"" is a well-meaning fable about rediscovering the light in a flickering world. Lina and Doon become friends after swapping gigs on Assignment Day the Ember ritual in which tweens learn what role theyll play in their community. Doon (Harry Treadaway) opts to be a laborer in the Pipeworks section where he plans to get a look at the ailing generator. Lina played by Saoirse Ronan ( ""Atonement"") becomes the running messenger. These positions help them navigate the mysteries and mazes of Ember. But long before these protagonists ride a rushing wave of water to their fate the movie bobs about on the swells of music that have become a Walden studio trademark. Thank goodness then for the ballast of Bill Murray Tim Robbins and Martin Landau. Murray plays the mayor who isnt as troubled by his citizens fates as one might hope. Robbins is Doons apathetic father a tinkering machinist. Martin Landau is Sul Doons drowsy supervisor. The brightest star however is the soundstage that stands in for endangered Ember.

Comments City of Ember Two hundred years after the earths surface has been depopulated survivors live deep underground in a sprawling neo-Victorian city presided over by a corrupt and complacent mayor (Bill Murray) and two teenagers (including Saoirse Ronan of Atonement) discover a secret set of instructions back to the outside world. A murky directionless plot sinks this big-budget fantasy despite Martin Laings elaborate production design; the dark industrial-looking sets often recall Brazil but without that films thrilling sense of an imagination run amok. This marks the live-action debut of animation director Gil Kenan (Monster House) and the squandered cast includes Tim Robbins Mary Kay Place Toby Jones Martin Landau and Mackenzie Crook. PG 95 min.

"In City of Ember doomsday has a ray of hope - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review In City of Ember doomsday has a ray of hope By Ty Burr Globe Staff / October 10 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + The city in ""City of Ember"" is about what youd expect from a place where Bill Murray has been elected mayor. Its run-down and cheerfully sodden a testament to the way things fall apart and time wounds all heels. City of Entropy more like it. Oh and its miles underground and far in the future -- a final outpost of humanity centuries after some horrific catastrophe has destroyed the earths surface.Did I mention its a family movie? You have to wonder whats in the water out in Hollywood; Doomsday is busting out all over. ""City of Ember"" lacks the vision and scope of ""WALL-E"" but its based on a pretty good kids book and it makes a pretty good ""Twilight Zone"" episode with hope dangling at the end rather than one of Rod Serlings cosmic black jokes.The lights are flickering and Ember is slowly dying but the small hermetic society it contains has no idea how to escape -- doesnt know theres anyplace to escape to. The surface world has been forgotten even if our heroine Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan the changeling child from ""Atonement"") draws landscapes with skies as if from genetic memory.She and rangy young Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) find a key to the way out when Lina comes upon a metallic box created by ""the builders"" when Ember was established. It provides exit instructions and as the two dash about the crumbling cityscape trying to put the pieces together you may feel as if youve wandered into the old computer game ""Myst.""The movies production design is the real star mulching ""Metropolis"" steampunk Charles Dickens and ""The Matrix"" into one beguilingly grotty underground universe. The human stars are overshadowed by all the clockworks. Murray makes an amusing moral slug of a mayor before he has to become a two-dimensional villain and Tim Robbins Martin Landau Mary Kay Place Mackenzie Crook and Marianne Jean-Baptiste (as the only person of color in town; howd those genetics work out?) take a back seat to the heavy-breathing plot and distressed ambience.Much of the movies small budget seems to have gone to the digital creation of giant mutant animals not in the book (youll never look at a star-nosed mole the same way). For all its missed chances though ""City of Ember"" still casts a neat glow. The storys powered by the sense of discovery that moves classic quest tales -- the idea that theres something much much bigger out there if only you can find it. Its a modest movie that understands the skys the limit. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

A fabulously designed underground metropolis proves more involving than the teenagers running through its streets in ""City of Ember"" a good-looking but no more than serviceable adaptation of Jeanne Dupraus 2003 novel. Director Gil Kenans disappointing live-action follow-up to his enjoyable toon debut ""Monster House"" shows promising flickers of visual invention throughout but the dramatic sparks fail to ignite in this simple-minded exercise in juvenile dystopia. Families may show interest initially but long-term B.O. prospects look so-so. A portentous opening voiceover tells of the subterranean city of Ember built to shelter English-speaking predominantly Caucasian humanity from undisclosed apocalyptic events transpiring on Earths surface. For reasons that have more to do with cool-sounding movie mythology than common sense the builders decreed Ember would last for only 200 years -- an important fact that has unfortunately fallen out of public awareness as the story proper begins. With the clock just about wound down to zero Ember powered by a massive generator thats seen better days is experiencing random power outages and hostile incursions by giant bugs and the like. The fate of the city rests on the shoulders of two nosy resourceful teens Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan ""Atonement"") and Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) who are quicker than the general populace to grasp that the time has come to leave Ember behind. As red-caped Lina darts hither and yon in her capacity as a paid messenger uncovering hidden clues and secret documents from the past Kenan and d.p. Xavier Perez Grobet frame her movements in crane and tracking shots that showcase the city to striking widescreen effect. Martin Laings nifty production design gradually reveals itself as a funhouse marvel of interconnected pipes and waterways ladders corridors and secret rooms; set decorator Celia Bobaks interiors are crammed with colored threads bizarre contraptions and other clever throwaway details. The films visual design is so captivating and unusual that at a certain point you wish you could ditch Doon Lina and her mute-cute little sister (twins Amy and Catherine Quinn) and explore Ember on your own for a couple hours. But Caroline Thompsons screenplay dutifully grinds its narrative gears and insists on turning these likable tykes into mini-saviors of mankind pitting them against Embers self-serving fat-cat Mayor Cole (Bill Murray giving a lazy performance as a lazy man). Corrupt politicians visiting terrorists an energy crisis and (eventually) a food shortage -- ""City of Ember"" is nothing if not timely. But any potentially relevant subtexts are short-circuited by the lumbering nature of the story which despite the strenuous exertions of Andrew Lockingtons score generates neither suspense nor a sense of wonder. Kenan tries to goose the action by unleashing a hideous monster (looking like a cross between a sea anemone and a wild boar) thats not only far too frightening for young tots but also completely at odds with the otherwise hum-drum tenor of the proceedings. Tim Robbins as Doons dad and Marianne Jean-Baptiste as Linas friend add some grown-up warmth in their too brief appearances and its nice to see Martin Landau as a cantankerous pipe-worker. Climactic Splash Mountain-style setpiece underlines the notion that ""City of Ember"" would have functioned better as a five-minute theme-park ride than as a 94-minute family film.

So goes the voice-over (of Tim Robbins) at the start of City of Ember a post-apocalyptic parable based on Jeanne Dupraus childrens novel and brought to the screen with a nifty visual inventiveness by Monster House director Gil Kenan. The box in question had been handed down from mayor to mayor for more than 100 years. But then somewhere along the line the job was bungled and the box - battered mysterious - ended up in the back of a closet. Forgotten. Now as the underground city - built in the wake of an unspoken global cataclysm - sinks into dangerous disrepair its days numbered a young girl has discovered said box. Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) doesnt know that shes holding her own future and the future of Embers fashionably ragtag populace in her hands but she does know somethings up. Much care has gone into the look of City of Ember. The city with its cobbled maze of streets and squares and its patched-up infrastructure exudes a magical albeit crumbling charm. The people wear woolly hippie-esque garb and the machinery that keeps everything (sort of) running has a rusted Rube Goldberg kookiness to it. With elements of Fritz Langs Metropolis and Marc Caros and Jean-Pierre Jeunets City of Lost Children Kenans film then looks wonderful. City of Embers titular star feels like a real ""character"" much as the house in his animated Monster House creaked and quaked with life. Alas City of Embers human denizens are less fully formed. Ronan - the tragic tattletale of Atonement - holds the camera and her eyes are amazing but theres not much for audiences to hang their emotions on. Lina has about as much depth and distinctiveness as a videogame hero. Ditto for Harry Treadwell who plays Linas teenage friend Doon Harrow. Ditto for most everybody actually Martin Landau as an old somnambulant waterworks engineer; Marianne Jean-Baptiste as a kindly gardener; Mary Kay Place as a fussy neighbor; and Robbins as Doons dad an idealistic radical in his youth now weary with resignation and dashed dreams. And then theres Bill Murray who plays Embers current mayor Cole and a corrupt deceptive old soul is he. Its fun to watch the wily sardonic Murray at work - stuffing his face with a secret cache of rationed sardines his gut sticking out like a pregnant womans spouting a politicians string of upbeat cliches. The despair of aging and the hope of youth are themes here but Kenan never gets heavy-handed about it and City of Ember has flashes of real energy and enchantment. But more often all the running the hiding the escaping (from giant moles from giant Murray) are decidedly less exciting and compelling than City of Ember wants to be. City of Ember 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Gil Kenan from the novel by Jeanne Duprau. With Bill Murray Tim Robbins Saoirse Ronan Harry Treadaway Martin Landau and Marianne Jean-Baptiste.

Im interested. For a kiddie adventure the movie based on the Jeanne DuPrau book has a pleasingly moody eerie quality It all takes place in a wonderfully designed post-apocalyptic wasteland. Then theres that evocative title casting a burnt aroma over everything. We never find out why the world ended but ""City of Ember"" begins where ""Dr. Strangelove"" left off What if humanity was driven underground to start over? (Minus the army of fertile vixens Strangelove promised.) Ember is a barely functioning place where everything is coated in layers of dirt and generators struggle to keep the lights on. A kindly inventor Loris Harrow (Tim Robbins) and his teen son Doon (the pixie-ish Harry Treadway) are resourceful enough to keep their household operating on steam and rust but the future looks bleak. Doon has just hit the age when the all-powerful Mayor (an amusingly dissipated Bill Murray) hands out lifetime job assignments. He is tapped to be a messenger which would be a waste of his mechanical skills so he swaps jobs with his classmate Lina (Saoirse Ronan the creepy girl from ""Atonement"") who has been assigned pipe-repair duties. In the bowels of the city Doons boss is a classic bureaucrat (Martin Landau) whose mantra is ""Its not my job."" As the two of them try to plug the leaks in a prehistoric section of pipe Doon asks when the new pipes are arriving. This is like Cuba asking when its going to get some new cars. Lina discovers the metal box referred to in the prologue a device rigged to stay locked for 200 years that has just now popped open in the back of her grandmas closet. If she can unlock the boxs full potential she and Doon may be able to figure out what is really happening behind the scenes in Ember - and that this clanking wheezy city isnt all there is to the world. As the kids piece together a plan of action that looks a lot like a video game there isnt much doubt or suspense about where the plot is going. The details are what make the movie. Murray for instance doesnt ham it up or talk down to the audience (though Landau does) and Ronan has an otherworldly poise. There are some minor pretensions to allegory but what the film is really about is its look which keeps you interested even when the irrepressible pluck of the kids becomes a bore. Jules Verne couldnt have imagined a more sinister and yet more enthralling junkyard than Ember a place where gears groan and power lines sizzle and the only way to deliver a message is to tell it to a kid then watch as she scampers across town to repeat it to somebody. CITY OF EMBER Ashy wonderland. Running time 95 minute. Rated PG (mild peril). At the Union Square the 84th Street the Kips Bay others.

Yet leaders assure that everything is fine theres nothing to worry about just return to your jobs and all will be OK in the end. Sound like the U.S. government as Wall Street collapsed? Yes actually. But it also is what happens in City of Ember in which a couple of kids manage to save a dying civilization so deluded by its leaders that it doesnt even realize its sick. Any resemblance to the current situation we find ourselves in may or may not be intentional - Jeanne Duprau wrote the novel on which the film is based in 2003. But it is striking. Ember is an underground city established by the Builders to last 200 years. As the film begins its year 241. The generator that provides the citys light and power is failing held together by spit and bailing wire though the mayor (Bill Murray) blithely insists theres nothing to worry about. Doon Harrow (Harry Treadaway) and Lina Mayfleet (Saoirse Ronan) arent convinced. On Assignment Day when 12-year-olds choose their lifelong employment out of a hat she gets a job in the pipeworks. Doon lands one as a messenger. Disappointed they trade and use their new gigs to figure out a way to save Ember or at least the people who live there. Doons father Loris (Tim Robbins) seems bemused by yet indulgent of his sons concerns. Lina meanwhile lives with her increasingly scattered grandmother and baby sister. Theres a curious box in their closet - one that shows up in the portraits of earlier mayors (Lina is a direct descendant of one of them; she sometimes delivers messages to the mayors office and sees the portraits hanging there). Her grandmother cant remember what the box is for exactly only that its important. Bit by bit Lina and Doon piece together the mystery while they uncover the corruption at the citys rotten core. No one has ever known what strategy the Builders had for Ember once time ran out and the mayor and his cronies arent particularly interested in anyone working to solve the problem. But Lina and Doon believe theres a way out. Director Gil Kenan creates a claustrophobic steam-punk-inspired world in which everything is vaguely familiar yet different. Ronan an Oscar-nominee for Atonement is outstanding exuding an infectious spunk. Treadway as the determined believer also is good. Murray has a grand old time as the self-satisfied mayor strangely portly in a city running out of food. Has anyone ever managed to make smugness not only forgivable but appealing? Whether by coincidence or intention City of Ember hits home leaving you hoping that well find our own Doon and Lina to get to the bottom of things before its too late.

Especially because the elusive Bill Murray pops up playing the pot-bellied mayor of a dying underground city. Hes fun and the movie slathered with grimy color looks striking (think The City of Lost Children for well children). But the story which follows two kids who try to save their burg from blackouts isnt well-executed losing itself to unclear mythology and sci-fi gibberish. B?
