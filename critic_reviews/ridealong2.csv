But you know what? Its mid-January. The Oscars are around the corner and were awash in reminders about how many fantastic movies came out last year. The Revenant so powerful Room so heartbreaking The Martian so... really a best picture nomination? I mean it was entertaining but come on. Amidst all this a movie like Ride Along 2 has its place. Its not going to wind up in the Smithsonian. Its not going to cure cancer. But what it can do - what it does do - is allow you to park your brain in neutral for 100 minutes laugh at some silly jokes ogle some taut body parts witness a few gun battles and explosions and then walk out of theatre and immediately forget it ever happened. And theres nothing wrong with that. In fact its kind of refreshing. So hate on haters. If you thought Star Wars The Force Awakens was too closely patterned after the original movie waitll you see Ride Along 2. The premise is virtually identical to 2014s Ride Along wannabe police detective Ben Barber (Kevin Hart) - now a rookie cop on the Atlanta force - wants nothing more than to impress his soon-to-be brother-in-law James (Ice Cube.) When James is sent to Miami to track down a hacker (Ken Jeong) working for a corrupt businessman (Benjamin Bratt who seems to be auditioning for the role of Mr. Roarke in a re-reboot of Fantasy Island) he takes Ben along with him in the hopes the motormouthed mini-man will cock things up so badly that James sister (Tika Sumpter) sees her future husband as a failure. But shock of shocks Ben manages to bumble his way to success earning James grudging respect. The addition of The Hangovers Jeong and the maddeningly beautiful Olivia Munn as a tough Atlanta homicide detective actually do a lot to elevate Ride Along 2 over the original. Both probably deserve better than this - Munn in particular is the victim of any excuse by director Tim Story to get her into a sports bra or revealing dress - but they come into it gamely and the chemistry between the four leads is surprisingly good. Yes Ben once again uses his video game knowledge to discover real-world clues. Yes he once again accidentally shoots someone (this time its Tyrese Gibson in a cameo as James partner.) Yes there are eye-rolling moments of dumbness particularly a baffling throwaway bit where Ben is tricked into eating nachos out of a garbage can. But in his own weird way Harts Ben is an admirable character. Hes in touch with his feminine side hes unabashedly nerdy and he wants nothing more than to make the people he loves happy and proud. There are much worse role models out there. Ride Along 2s biggest problem might be figuring out how to regurgitate the formula for yet another sequel - if Ben hasnt proven himself by now what more can he do? - but ultimately that wont matter. Since youll have forgotten this movie the minute the credits roll Ride Along 3 will surely feel just as fresh. In the meantime go watch Leonardo DiCaprio get mauled by a bear.

First its set-up was solid if uninspired -- tough Atlanta cop Ice Cube drags along mouthy wannabe Kevin Hart who also happens to be his beloved sisters boyfriend on a day of answering police calls in order to scare him away from both the job and the girl. (The script had been kicking around Hollywood for a decade or so.) Second it had diminutive walking dynamo Kevin Hart whose motormouth antics regularly provide many undeserving films with welcome bursts of energy.A Ride Along 2 which picks up not long after the first film ended doesnt mess much with the formula except that everything feels more frayed and tired this time around. Now Ben Barber (Hart) is an actual police rookie and his impending nuptials to Angela (Tika Sumpter given distressingly little to do this time around) are drawing near. Angelas veteran-cop brother James (Cube) is still irritated by Bens antics and when the duo head to Miami to help bring down Antonio Pope (Benjamin Bratt having more fun than anyone else it seems) a drug kingpin posing as a philanthropist James decides once again to try and do away with Ben. The groom-to-be however is excited by the idea of having his bachelor party in Miami. But they still have the case to crack involving a renegade hacker (Ken Jeong) who may hold the key to bringing down Pope with beautiful local detective Maya Cruz (Olivia Munn) also along for the ride. Bland Hollywood sequels generally suffer from a combination of two things Lets call themA samenessA and moreness. The films often feel like retreads but they also feel artificially scaled up -- in an effort to accommodate bigger budgets bigger box-office ambitions bigger star egos whatever. On paperA Ride Along 2A has theA more -- another blustery comedian in Jeong; a bigger more visually enticing city in Miami; more explosions etc. -- and the same -- its still basically these two guys doing their thing. But somehow the effect is lessened. Hart doesnt get any real chance to cut loose with his shtick and his underrated talent for slapstick isnt used much either. (There is a very funny bit near the end however when James uses the bulletproof-vest-clad Ben as a human shield.) Surprisingly the slack isnt taken up by Jeong who is given a couple of decent lines and some typical Ken Jeong-esque weirdness but seems to be operating mostly on auto-pilot. The episodic nature of the firstA Ride AlongA at least allowed us to focus our attention on the two leads. Not that it did all that much with the idea -- Ice Cubes performance consisted mostly of pissy reaction shots -- but the power of movie stars is such that sometimes you feel like youve gotten your moneys worth just by basking in their presence. But even that aspect ofA Ride Along 2A feels lessened diluted somehow. Maybe its the bigger cast or maybe its that nobody has anything left to prove. Cube is still his glaring glowering disbelieving self but with the reduced animosity between the two leads comes a reduction in comic potential. You dont expect much from this movie and you definitely dont get it. Fans of the first likely wont mind it butA Ride Along 2A doesnt even really give you the chance to be disappointed.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jan. 14 2016 409PM EST Last updated Thursday Jan. 14 2016 414PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Tim Story Written by Phil Hay Matt Manfredi Starring Kevin Hart Ice Cube Olivia Munn Classification PG Genre comedy Country USA Language English Considering that an ""actual film"" like James Bond head-scratcher Spectre doesnt bother to make any damn sense theres probably no need for a buddy-cop comedy starring a hyperactive Kevin Hart to be comprehensible either.That being said Ride Along 2 - everything one would expect and less - is over-the-top imbecilic. The sequel has Kevin Harts yappy rookie policeman accompanying rapper-actor Ice Cubes straight-man detective/imminent brother-in-law on a vice case to Miami. Theres every reason for the idiot cop not to accompany the capable cop but you know movie. Benjamin Bratt who thinks hes in one is charismatic as an urbane villain and the Cube ranks second only to Samuel L. Jackson in saying ""goddamn."" But the rest of this mess is a goofy formula of chase scenes inappropriate explosions and banter banter banter.Harts irritating character desperately seeks approval but his idiocy is too much. The comedian makes Jerry Lewis look like Benedict Cumberbum - and if you think that line is funny Ride Along 2 is your kind of jam.

Colbert / Universal)""Ride Along 2"" rides along on whether or not Kevin Harts brand of funny works for you.This is a Kevin Hart vehicle through and through and director Tim Story -- working with Hart a fourth time after the first ""Ride Along"" and two ""Think Like a Man"" movies -- knows its best to just wind him up and let him go.Its a good role for Hart. As Ben Barber a nerdy gamer whos now a probationary officer with the Atlanta police department Hart is wide-eyed sincere and always aiming to please. Theres nothing cynical or sarcastic about him and his optimistic worldview accentuates the best in Harts manic fast-talking style.Not that ""Ride Along 2"" is an in-depth character study. Its a formulaic action buddy comedy with Ice Cubes James Payton playing the straight man foil to Harts erratic but well-meaning Barber. But Hart lets it rip Cube flashes his signature Ice Cube scowl and theres enough gas left in this tank to take another spin around the block with the self-proclaimed ""brothers-in-law.""Barber and Payton head down to Miami to bust a drug dealer with ties to Atlanta but really does any of that matter? The Miami backdrop provides the pair with a sunny change of scenery and an excuse to parade some bikinis across the screen and for Hart to wear linen outfits capped off with straw fedoras.Olivia Munn plays a Miami police officer Ken Jeong is a hacker and Benjamin Bratt is a shady politician and drug dealer rounding out the racially diverse cast. Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi who co-wrote the first ""Ride Along"" in 2014 provide just enough structure to keep things moving along.But really its all about Hart who has no problem making himself the butt of every joke. Here he gets beaten up by a child falls into a chicken coop gets mocked for his size and all sorts of other indignities and humiliations. But he always comes out with a smile and a positive attitude.Barber is devoted to his fiance (hes engaged to Paytons sister played by Tika Sumpter) whom hes marrying in a matter of days and he truly cares about the details of his forthcoming wedding. Men in real life and in the movies are often dismissive of the wedding planning process but Barber is truly into the whole thing -- ""I have a vision for my wedding"" he boasts -- which speaks to the wholesome heart at the center of his character. As does the way hes constantly barking ""James"" seeking the approval of his partner and brother-in-law to be.Still Hart has yet to find the part thats going to elevate him to the next level of Hollywood stardom. Last years ""Get Hard"" and ""The Wedding Ringer"" were backward steps for the comedian not allowing him to stretch his persona or illustrate the kind of hustle and drive that has made him a self-propelled comic star. Hart is still seeking out his ""Truman Show"" the role that will break him out of his comfort zone and make Hollywood take him more seriously.But ""Ride Along 2"" does its job. ""Ride Along"" was a surprise hit earning 135 million and becoming Ice Cube and Kevin Harts biggest starring vehicle. ""Ride Along 2"" is essentially more of the same and Hart is its driving force.

Ken Jeong Benjamin Bratt and Olivia Munn join the cast; director Tim Story (""Fantastic Four"") returns. In theaters Jan. 15. advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A rookie cop and a no-nonsense detective team up to solve a case in Miami.CAST Kevin Hart Ice Cube Olivia MunnRATED PG-13 (suggestive humor and language)LENGTH 142PLAYING AT Area theatersBOTTOM LINE A low-wattage sequel to a comedy that wasnt exactly glowing in the first place. When we last saw wannabe cop Ben Barber played by Kevin Hart and surly Atlanta detective James Payton played by rapper Ice Cube the two men had overcome their differences cracked a major case and come to grips with the fact that they would be family once Ben married James sister Angela (Tika Sumpter). That was two years ago in ""Ride Along"" a modest hit directed by Tim Story (""Think Like a Man""). Time clearly does not fly in this burgeoning buddy-cop franchise because in ""Ride Along 2"" Ben has only recently graduated from the police academy and is still on the verge of marrying Angela. Time moves slowly within the movie itself too. Like the first film this sequel has two appealing stars in the bouncy Hart and the glowering Cube but its weak gags and thin plot dont give them much to work with. advertisement | advertise on newsday The premise this time is that James needs to follow a drug ring case that leads to Miami and Ben begs to join him. The change of location is driven purely by cinematic concerns of course. It offers a glamorous new backdrop gives the director several chances to show scantily-clad women and allows Hart to dress in an absurd guayabera and straw hat. While in Miami Ben and James encounter Maya a no-nonsense cop played by an overly sour Olivia Munn. A little spark arises between her and James a cute idea that should have been explored further. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviewsOSCAR NOMINATIONS PREVIEWWe predicted the Oscars best-picture nominees Ken Jeong as the usual nerdy hacker with valuable information is ostensibly this films major guest star though he seems slightly underused and never quite feels like part of the Hart-Cube team. Unexpectedly Benjamin Bratt gives the movie a slight tingle of danger and sexuality as Antonio Pope a corrupt businessman. Against the backdrop of a lavish party Pope whisks Maya off her feet in a classic dance-with-the-devil sequence and Bratts physical grace sells it nicely. Surely that wasnt supposed to be the highlight of this action-comedy but when youre at a ""Ride Along"" movie you take what you can get.

Ride Along 2 is on cruise control review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRide Along 2 is on cruise control reviewKevin Hart clowns Ice Cube growls. Rinse and repeat. If only Ride Along 2 could be more than just another witless and derivative sequel. Ice Cube and Kevin Hart star in Ride Along 2.  (TNS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 14 2016Ride Along 2Starring Kevin Hart Ice Cube Olivia Munn Ken Jeong and Benjamin Bratt. Directed by Tim Story. At GTA theatres. 101 minutes. PGKevin Hart clowns Ice Cube growls. Rinse and repeat.Thats the plot of Ride Along 2 the odd-couple comedy sequel that is likely to finally knock Star Wars The Force Awakens from its perch atop the North American box office this weekend.Article Continued BelowI kid but only a little and certainly not about the Star Wars part. Hart and Cube are doing essentially what they did in the first Ride Along which opened at No. 1 in its January 2014 release weekend. History is planning to repeat itself.For this rematch Harts cop wannabe Ben is still trying to prove his police bona fides to Cubes skeptical detective James. Ben still wants to marry James sister Angela (Tika Sumpter) and still feels he needs the blessing of the grumpy bro despite -- or maybe because of -- Bens outlandish hero antics in the first film.A ridiculous plot contrivance takes Ben and James from hometown Atlanta to Miami (there must have been a tax credit involved). Theyre chasing a drug lord named Antonio Pope who might as well have been played by the digital version of Benjamin Bratt since the human version looks embalmed.Ben gets up to his usual ridiculous loud shenanigans. James scowls and tells him to shut up and get serious. James car blows up again (spoiler alert) and occasional hilarity ensues as destiny manifests itself. The only novelty is Olivia Munn as a fetching Miami detective and Ken Jeong as an annoying-but-helpful hacker. The scene-stealing Jeong actually dials down his usual manic behaviour probably because Hart didnt want too much of his goofball thunder stolen.Ride Along 2 plays like your typical January multiplex-filler in other words but its too bad the ambitions of the studio director Tim Story and screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi dont extend beyond serving second helpings of the same-old same-old. They even manage to make Miami look boring.This actually feels like the third or fourth Ride Along not the second one which is a real shame considering the obvious great chemistry between Kevin Hart and Ice Cube that isnt being fully utilized.This Ride needs to shift out of cruise control.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Shoddy and exhausted from the start this painfully unfunny buddy-cop comedy lands with a plop in the January sewer of failed Hollywood castoffs. Tim Storys 2014 original seemed better plugged into the tensions between exuberant motormouth Ben (Kevin Hart) and his girlfriends brother the perpetually scowling James (Ice Cube) an ice-cold Atlanta cop he hopes to impress. We return to their story with Ben now a rookie on the force one week away from his wedding. Once again crime looms--this time in the form of a silky voiced Miami drug lord (Benjamin Bratt)--and even before the bickering duo heads south you can accurately predict every bikini-babe-adorned plot twist. Jokes range from fashion faux pas (Ben dresses like hes ready for his cameo on Miami Vice) to Asian bashing (The Hangovers Ken Jeong is never given the chance to cut loose with his wicked tongue) or ogling female detective Maya (Olivia Munn introduced in a sports bra). On purely technical grounds a couple of action scenes transcend the mundanity and theres one surreal sight an Apocalypse Now gag with the determined Hart rising out of the water in slo-mo to the strains of Wagner. But mostly this is the definition of a waste of time aggressively derivative yet barely digestible. Eddie Murphy please come back and show these clowns how its done.

The movie opens in U.S. theaters on Friday. Related Facts ""Ride Along 2"" Rated PG-13 for ""sequences of violence sexual content language and some drug material.""Running time 101 minutes2 stars out of 4 With the same brand of silliness and a bit more creativity than the original ""Ride Along 2""doesnt pretend to be anything more than what it is a sequel designed to offer a second helping of exactly what worked the first time around. The original ""Ride Along"" topped the box office for three straight weeks when it opened in January of 2014 collecting 150 million returns on its modest 25 million budget. It focused on Ben (Kevin Hart) an excitable video-game junkie and wannabe cop and his attempts to impress his disinterested future brother-in-law James (Ice Cube) a hard-nosed police detective. Hart is goofy and slapstick; Cube is stern and annoyed. Producers reprise the formula and return to many of the original films artists for the sequel including screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi and director Tim Story. This time around Ben is a fresh graduate of the police academy a week away from his wedding to Angela (Tika Sumpter). Hes still trying to impress her brother James who still cant stand him. At Angelas urging James reluctantly agrees to bring Ben on a police mission from Atlanta to Miami where James is on the hunt for a suspicious hacker AJ (Ken Jeong). AJ is linked to a case James is working in Atlanta but hes also connected to a major Miami drug lord Antonio Pope (Benjamin Bratt) who has been masquerading as a philanthropist. This prompts a local homicide detective Maya (Olivia Munn) to join the investigation. The plot is too complicated to explain (theres government corruption and shipping fraud involved) but it doesnt even really matter. Its just about setting up ever more elaborate situations for Hart to be a goofball to Cubes straight man. The actors deliver just like in the last movie and others where they play similar roles. Cube is predictably tough and snarly making Hart seem even more smiley and animated by contrast. He eats up the camera in every scene. Everything else is a side dish though Jeong amuses as a sex-crazed hacker nebbish and Sherri Shepherd is over the top as an obsessive wedding planner. Munn gets in on the action scenes and performs a sultry dance with Bratt but Sumpter is given little to do. Since this is a buddy-cop movie it wouldnt be complete without car chases and explosions and the fancy rides and fireworks in ""Ride Along 2"" reflect the films larger budget. Theres ample eye candy in the form of bikini-wearing women glamorous Miami settings and sleek sports cars including a breathtaking baby-blue Jaguar. The most playful sequence involves that car and special effects that transform a real street chase into what looks like a video game. Although ""Ride Along 2"" has fancier trim than the original its really just the same old ride. But if you thought the first one was fun taking another spin wont disappoint.

(  / Universal Pictures) The 2014 hit ""Ride Along"" was a derivative addition to the buddy-cop comedy canon. But it was entertaining enough to provide a much-needed reprieve from the ultra-serious dramas of Academy Awards season. That makes ""Ride Along 2"" a retread of a retread. The movie follows a path nearly identical to the originals even reusing some of the gags. Were writers Phil Hay and Mike Manfredi -- also known for the painful ""R.I.P.D."" -- paid to cut and paste? Ice Cube and Kevin Hart return as odd couple James and Ben. Since we last saw them Ben has quit his job as a high school security guard and become a police officer. He also has gotten engaged to Jamess sister Angela (Tika Sumpter). Ben aspires to one day become a detective just like his walking scowl of a future brother-in-law. The week before the wedding James has to take a trip to interview a suspect in a drug case and to get her fiance out of her hair Angela begs James to let Ben tag along. And so the action moves from Atlanta to Miami which gives director Tim Story ample opportunities to capture women in thong bikinis showing off underboob. Olivia Munn Ken Jeong Kevin Hart and Ice Cube star in the buddy-cop comedy sequel ""Ride Along 2."" (Quantrell D. Colbert/Universal Pictures) After getting assaulted by cleavage the two land on an even bigger case involving shady businessman Antonio Pope (Benjamin Bratt). To take him down James and Ben team with Maya (Olivia Munn) Miami P.D.s hottest and hacker A.J. (Ken Jeong). You know what happens next discoveries and setbacks a few chases some shootouts an explosion or two. The plot is paint by numbers which puts pressure on the comedy to deliver. But it doesnt. Hart and Cube can be very funny; we know that from watching them ridicule a student driver on ""Conan."" In the movie though the jokes are sparse and half-baked. An accidental shooting was mildly amusing in the first ""Ride Along"" but when it happens again we sense laziness at work. As always Hart unleashes his manic energy on the audience but his heart doesnt seem to be in it the way it was in the original. Maybe hes getting tired of the shtick too. The action on the other hand is impressive. In the movies first minutes a car chase inside a garage uses sporadic slow motion to stylish effect. During another high-speed pursuit the action transforms into Bens favorite video game; even James becomes a pixelated character. The choice is both hilarious and useful with a sidebar that shows how fast the car is traveling and where the bad guys are. Moments like that offer some indication of what the movie might have been had if a little more thought gone into making it good rather than making it merely exist. The original movie kick-started Universal Pictures year with a worldwide take of 150 million. What studio wouldnt want to replicate that success? But put in that context ""Ride Along 2"" starts to look like nothing more than a blatant cash grab during the January dead zone. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains sequences of violence sexual content strong languageand some drug material. 101 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Movie Reviews 01/13/2016 0300pm Ride Along 2 Coasting on Kevin Harts charm tired cop shtick Richard Roeper richardroeper | email Straddling the line between flat-out farce and buddy-cop action movie ""Ride Along 2"" is a slick good-looking fast-paced and profoundly unoriginal piece of work. This is 100 minutes of recycled shtick -- a cop film with no roots in actual police work but a deep connection to dozens of other cop films. From the supervisor chewing out the rogue cops to the slick businessman whos actually a crime lord to the obligatory big finale on the docks ""Ride Along 2"" is the movie equivalent of a cover band. Weve seen it all before and often in much better films. Director Tim Storys follow-up to the 2014 hit reunites Ice Cubes snarling veteran Atlanta cop James with Kevin Harts pesky motormouth Ben the former high school security guard who is now a month out of the police academy and a week away from marrying James sister Angela (Tika Sumpter) whose main function in this film is to look beautiful and shake her head at Bens wacky antics. Like this. Ben gets into a heated argument in his kitchen with wedding planner Cori (Sherri Shepherd) who is nixing all of his ideas. To make his point Ben stands on a chair so he wont appear so tiny. When Cori also stands on a chair Ben climbs onto the table right under the whirring ceiling fan ... Cue the cartoon slapstick. Time and again Ben is punched kicked and pushed around. He falls from a second-story ledge he lands on his face several times during a foot chase he narrowly avoids being eaten by an alligator -- and thats only a partial list of Bens suffering. Yet like a character in one of the violent video games Ben loves to play hes never really hurt. All of the aforementioned suffering (and more) is played for big broad laughs. Sometimes its funny. Mostly its just loud and brutal and pointless. Through a convoluted turn of the plot device James and Ben make the trek from Atlanta to Miami to interview a possible witness on a case theyre working. This gives director Story and the team of screenwriters a chance to fill up the screen with many images of women in skimpy outfits gyrating about whether theyre on the beach or in a nightclub or even working retail. In fact with the exception of that abrasive wedding planner Im fairly certain every other single female character in ""Ride Along 2"" appears in a bikini or halter top at some point. When Olivia Munns no-nonsense Miami homicide detective Maya shows up at a crime scene shes fresh from a workout so of course shes wearing tights and a sports bra her badge dangling from a chain around her neck. Because she wouldnt have a sweatshirt in the car or anything. (In an earlier scene Tika Sumpters Angela seduces Ben while wearing bra panties and a naughty cop outfit. The scene feels about half-finished with no payoff when we cut to the next locale. Apparently the main goal was to get Tika Sumpter in a push-up bra.) Ken Jeong has the Ken Jeong role as A.J. a squirrely comic-relief hacker who is the key to cracking the big case. A.J. often cracks wise from the back of the car as Ben and James bicker the day away. The hyperactive Ben never shuts up and constantly screws up on a level that would have him facing criminal charges in the real world. The closed-off perpetually growling James keeps telling Ben to shut up and to stay focused. If either character has anything approaching a second dimension it has eluded me through two movies. Kevin Hart is an enormously talented stand-up comic and an instantly likable screen presence. Most of his movies havent been very good but they make a lot of money. Hart has the talent and the charisma to take it to the next level and do stellar work in more challenging fare. In ""Ride Along 2"" hes on cruise control all the way. [s3r star=2/4] Universal Pictures presents a film directed by Tim Story and written by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. Running time 102 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sequences of violence sexual content language and some drug material.).

By the end its most likely youll be laughing at the antics of the bite-sized comic -- whose style is reminiscent of an overenthusiastic puppy nipping at your ankles -- even if youre not sure why. This is why Ice Cube is the perfect audience proxy as Harts tough and taciturn counterpart; while he initially wants to bat the irritating pup away Harts persistence and moxie are difficult to resist.""Ride Along"" saw Cube as James Patton a hard-boiled detective of few words pressured by his sister Angie (Tika Sumpter) to take her boyfriend Ben (Hart) along for a ride on which disastrous capers and some unlikely detective work ensued. In ""Ride Along 2"" directed again by Tim Story James heads for parts south after a ""Fast and the Furious""-style opener in which he uncovers a mysterious USB drive from a drug dealer with a hackers calling card leading him to Miami. You can guess who begs to go along for the ride again. This time Bens a fresh police academy graduate whos a bit of an idiot-savant when it comes to law enforcement.In South Beach James and Ben link up with hacker AJ (a loopy Ken Jeong) and another tough homicide cop Maya Cruz (Olivia Munn). They make an odd foursome with Ben and AJ bonding over their nerdy hobbies and Maya and James sharing a similarly serious approach (""Its like watching rams mate"" Ben spits in disgust). Jeong makes a surprisingly good foil for Hart; the two comedians subvert the stereotypes of their outward appearances balancing the qualities that make them less-than-macho with over-the-top braggadocio and ego. AJ the hacker turns out to be quite the ladies man and Ben has no qualms embracing his feminine side whether its in his overzealous wedding planning or his choice of undergarment.The plot itself is run-of-the-mill cop comedy stuff with Benjamin Bratt delivering the villain role as a suave Miami heavyweight whos smuggling drugs and other contraband. The story beats are well-trodden the action sequences and visual effects nothing more than serviceable if chaotic but theres fun to be had in ""Ride Along 2"" thanks to Hart and Jeong who play fast and loose with the tropes. All Ben wants is to prove himself as a cop and a brother but he doesnt feel the need to change anything about his metrosexual nerd persona finding strength in it. All those hours of video games somehow pay off.In spite of this progressive attitude toward masculinity the film is rife with lazily executed stereotypes about women -- what they might wear to go bikini shopping and what might make them jealous -- but the larger female roles are fierce too including Sherri Shepherd as a rabid wedding planner who spars with Groomzilla Ben. ""Ride Along 2"" takes quite a bit of time to pick up speed -- and doesnt have the verve and energy of the first film -- but it has its moments particularly when Hart hits the gas on his signature zingers.+ Quantrell D.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The lightweight time-waster of the week cant be anything but ""Ride Along 2"" a tiresome follow-up to 2014s Kevin Hart/Ice Cube anti-buddy cop comedy. The first earned more than 140 million not ""Fast and Furious"" money but not chump change either. This pile of overzealous idiocy hits the screen before nostalgia for that surprise hit dissipates. And even if that collection of cops and robbers misadventures doesnt occupy much of your memory this one is (occasionally) fun and (entirely) silly in a lowest common denominator way. It can support itself largely thanks to Cubes gruff slow burn and Harts madcap timing. Theyve got solid opposites-attract chemistry. While its far from a prizewinner the movie is not a total loss. Next years Razzies Worst Film awards wont put it at the top of the nominees list (or is that the bottom?). Its just not pretentious enough to get a shellacking. For the uninformed Cube plays a hard-as-shoe-leather Atlanta detective who is angry about everything including the fact that hes angry. Hart about to marry Cubes sister is a longtime cop wannabe who has finally graduated to rookie. For 101 minutes Officer Pushy and Private Pipsqueak fight and hassle and mess with each other just like last time. This chapter aims higher -- too high frankly -- as they are assigned to break up a Miami drug ring. They come across a computer-savvy witness (Ken Jeong still struggling to get parts worth his talents) a policewoman maybe even tougher than Cube (Olivia Munn in a virtually laugh-free role based on her considerable hotness) and a wealthy Hispanic crime mastermind (Benjamin Bratt overplaying the south Florida Latino as if he was on Univisions ""Sabado Gigante""). Theyve all done well in suitable roles but here are squandered which is the films biggest crime. Its clear that the bickering brothers-to-be are on different wavelengths. When they arrive for their assignment Cube keeps his standard threads while Hart dresses in citrus shades and flower patterns that look like Tommy Bahama barfed on him. To amp up the Atlanta cops fish-out-of-water feelings director Tim Story recycles Sunshine State gimmicks. Wherever you look there are multimillion-dollar racing cars dance clubs models in bikinis and the ever-popular snapping alligator. The ideas seem to be on loan from a museum of tired comedy tropes. Universal Pictures Ice Cube and Kevin Hart in ""Ride Along 2."" And yet there are entertaining moments although Cube has been much funnier playing an almost identical character in the ""Jump Street"" films firing off utterly profane zingers with sharper direction. Similarly Hart is howlingly good in his own projects like his reality TV satire ""Real Husbands of Hollywood"" on BET and his stand-up documentary ""Laugh at My Pain."" Here they have a few good actor-to-actor volleys. Harts willingness to throw himself down the stairs for a laugh pays off when the substandard script comes up short. Which is close to always. Just having the pair of them on-screen taps into a reservoir of goodwill. They are in the category of Teflon performers who have a nonstick immunity from dreadful material. Of course theyre also nearly as rich as Bill Gates so taking a pass on this one wont harm anybody but crazed completists. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Kevin Hart (left) and Ice Cube (right) reunite for ""Ride Along 2"" and are joined by Ken Jeong in the directionless sequel. Photo Quantrell D. Colbert Associated Press Ride Along 2 is a dud even compared with first Ride Along 1 / 1 Back to Gallery For everybody getting sick of all these good and great movies in theaters right now theres ""Ride Along 2"" which is not in the same league as even the first ""Ride Along"" much less ""The Revenant"" ""Carol"" ""Brooklyn"" ""Son of Saul"" ""Anomalisa"" and ""The Big Short."" Its a formula movie which wouldnt necessarily be a problem except that its a sort of bad version of itself. In the original ""Ride Along"" the pairing of Kevin Hart and Ice Cube had a certain appeal. The notion of the relentless Hart in collision with the impassive Cube was amusing just to think about and the filmmakers were able to fashion an action comedy that lived up to expectations -- barely but still. Hart is a very funny guy and Cube is a good straight man and with decent material they couldnt fail. But they cant make something out of nothing and to watch ""Ride Along 2"" is to get the sense of a screenplay that was never right that was just pushed along on the faith that the actors could rescue it. For the record the start is decent enough. First the movie establishes Benjamin Bratt as the suave villain a drug dealer and smuggler who poses as a philanthropist. This is followed by a genuinely funny scene in which Hart as a rookie cop blows his cover in a stakeout and puts his colleagues at risk. But the stakeout scene is like a stand-alone skit and the moment the story kicks in the movie starts to collapse. James (Cube) an Atlanta detective is assigned to put together a team and go to Miami to investigate a murder. Ben (Hart) his future brother-in-law is desperate to accompany him but James refuses. And then James relents if only because if he doesnt there wont be a movie. Because Hart is a real actor he doesnt just play jokes. He tries to make sense of the script hes given and what hes given in ""Ride Along 2"" is a character who has no judgment never shuts up and seems driven by an irrational compulsion to prove his worth. In a merely comic character that might be fine but ""Ride Along 2"" asks us to take Ben seriously and when we do the laughs fall away. Were presented with someone whos not just zany or absurd but neurotic and dangerous to be around. Its one thing not to believe that James would take him to Miami. Its another thing to start wishing that he hadnt and yet another to start wishing theyd all stayed home. These are the stages a viewer goes through when watching ""Ride Along 2."" Olivia Munn appears as a Miami cop who joins the men on their adventures. Her purpose in the movie is more or less to show up in scenes looking like Olivia Munn. No one should argue with that but an actress would never take a nothing role like this were she offered something better. Munn deserves a lot better than ""Ride Along 2.""

Theres not much evidence of this in Ride Along 2 wherein they reprise their buddy-cop roles of tough guy James (Cube) and his bumbling prospective brother-in-law and wannabe partner Ben (Hart)--nor even for that matter in the original Ride Along. But while promoting their new film the two actors appeared together in a Conan segment where they accompanied the host on a drivers-ed jaunt with one of his staffers. In about 10 minutes Cube with his scowl that can turn mischievous and Hart with his motormouth convey a loose affectionate occasionally testy chemistry. They seem like a good team.The Ride Along movies have far more incident than an afternoon of driving instruction but feel far less free; they are bound by cop-movie conventions and encumbered by an apparent desire not to spoof them. While the movies cold open is the kind of lifeless cop-movie preamble that doesnt feature either of the lead characters Cube and Harts first scene together in Ride Along 2 sets itself up perfectly for bait-and-switch parody. It takes place at an after-hours gathering of criminals and muscle cars and by hiring Tyrese Gibson for a cameo as Cubes partner the movie clearly evokes the Fast And Furious series. Ride Along 2 even comes from the same studio which should give the movie carte blanche to goof on Vin Diesels passion project. But director Tim Story who has made a career of being asked back for sequels to movies he didnt direct particularly well (oddly he hasnt directed any of the sequels to his best film Barbershop) doesnt do spoofery. He doesnt even do humorous imitation. The movie nods ever so slightly at the Furious movies dispatches Tyrese and moves on.This would be fine if the Ride Along movies had an identity of their own. Its kind of amazing that they dont given the two distinct comic personas theyre built around. Cubes James scowls with irritation at the antics of Harts Ben who has gone from wanting desperately to become a cop (in the first film) to wanting desperately to prematurely graduate from beat cop to detective. Though Bens desire to ""prove himself"" carries a lot less urgency now that hes already a cop and all set to marry James sister Angela (Tika Sumpter) at least the movie smartly sidesteps any sense of relationship jeopardy between Ben and Angela. Their couplehood is genuinely sweet which is why she convinces her brother to take Ben on a confidence-building police trip to Miami even though its the week of their wedding. (It also serves to distract Ben from wedding-planning stresses which Hart plays with amusing sincerity.)Beyond the slight uptick in bared skin Miami doesnt offer much variety from the characters home base of Atlanta. Ben and James are there to question hacker A.J. (Ken Jeong) about his connection to a crime ring; on their way they team up with local cop Maya Cruz (Olivia Munn) and run afoul of a possible drug dealer (Benjamin Bratt occasionally droll). Ride Along 2 is brisk and busy with action sequences most of which are well outside Storys skill set as a director. The best of them takes advantage of Harts physical prowess for a ""foot chase"" (as he repeatedly refers to it) through countless yards and houses. Story overcuts the action but at least the scale doesnt overwhelm him. This sequence also showcases Harts comic strength in a film series that otherwise miscategorizes his acuity as verbal. His manic delivery creates the impression that Hart is an expert fast-talker but most of his chatter involves saying ""James"" repeatedly; as with his stand-up routines its his accompanying physicality that actually gets laughs. The movie does at least add in some other characters to prop up the half-assed bantering and bickering. Jeong plays a role previously filled by Conan OBrien or Joe Pesci in the Lethal Weapon sequels the annoying goofball third wheel meant to enliven a familiar partnership. The perpetually hunched-over Jeong doesnt have much of a character beyond that but he manages some funny moments especially when he and Hart excitedly make small talk during a stakeout sounding like 10-year-olds at a slumber party. Olivia Munn who has shown capable comic timing in environments both improvisational (Attack Of The Show) and tightly scripted (The Newsroom) has less to do presented as the female equivalent to Cubes tough guy--though Cube never has to show up to a crime scene inexplicably dressed in a sports bra.The implausibilities cop-movie checkboxes and mildly wasted talent make Ride Along 2 lazy but not downright loathsome. If anything its perhaps slightly more amusing and agreeable than the original--a sign of how little that films seemingly surefire premise wound up mattering. The sequel meanwhile functions as an object lesson in the way the mildest likability can convince actors and filmmakers that theyre doing something right. Hart and Cube probably had chemistry on set and assumed it would translate into big laughs onscreen. Ride Along 3 probably wont be very good but the Conan segment that accompanies it might be fun.

Colbert This photo provided by Universal Pictures shows Ice Cube left as James Payton and Kevin Hart as Ben Barber in a scene from the film ""Ride Along 2."" The movie opens in U.S. theaters on Jan. 15 2016. (Quantrell D. Colbert/Universal Pictures via AP) James Payton (Ice Cube) has little patience with his future brother-in-law Ben Barber (Kevin Hart). Payton is an Atlanta undercover detective who takes his job seriously; Barber is a highly excitable beat cop who aspires to be his partner. Although theres a joking aspect to their banter theres also an undercurrent of genuine hostility coming from Payton. But for the sake of his sister Angela (Tika Sumpter) he does his best to put up with her fiances antics.That tolerance however only goes so far. Payton is less than thrilled when the diminutive motor-mouthed Barber insists on accompanying him to Miami on a case involving the drug trade. And sure enough no sooner have they arrived in the balmy metropolis than Barber sets about creating chaos.The little guy relies on his in-your-face style whether hes dealing with hacker A.J. (Ken Jeong) whose cooperation is essential to cracking the case or Miami detective Maya Cruz (Olivia Munn) whose no-nonsense demeanor would seem to make her an ideal match for Payton -- professionally and otherwise. But bringing down Antonio Pope (Benjamin Bratt) -- a prominent executive whos also a drug lord -- will require a much more serious approach.As cop comedies go ""Ride Along 2"" gets the job done. But this sequel to the 2014 hit comes across as a significantly less funny rehash. Theres a been-there done-that vibe to the proceedings that cant help but be disappointing. Working from a screenplay by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi returning director Tim Story (""Barbershop"") keeps things moving but without much visual flair. And despite their considerable chemistry theres only so much that Cube and Hart can do with their characters Payton is still pretty much a sourpuss and Barber remains a clueless buffoon with just enough luck to save the day. Considering the shortcomings of ""Ride Along 2"" another sequel isnt necessary -- but its probably inevitable.What ""Ride Along 2""  21/2 stars out of four  Run time 140  Rating PG-13  Content Violence sexual content language drug material Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Ice Cube and Kevin Hart are back on the street and out for laughs ""Ride Along 2"" reunites rapper-turned-actor and comedian.

Samoy The Republic | azcentral.com 843 a.m. MST January 14 2016Ice Cube Olivia Munn and Kevin Hart star in ""Ride Along 2.""(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 3 starsThe buddy cop movie is nothing new. Theres a cop thats good at his job. Hes shackled unwillingly to a partner who is annoying and ridiculously underqualified for the job. Yet somehow they bond as they chase after the bad guy.""Ride Along 2"" doesnt pretend to break new ground and follows this unimaginative formula precisely. This sequel has Ben Barber (Kevin Hart) just days away from marrying Angela Payton (Tika Sumpter). She wants bridezillla Ben out of the house as the wedding details are being finalized so her cop brother James Payton (Ice Cube) agrees to take Ben on a case out in Miami. Secretly James hopes to use the trip to prove to Ben he is unequipped to be a police officer. Along the way they team up with another detective Maya (Olivia Munn) to take down the bad guy Antonio Pope (Benjamin Bratt).The level of enjoyment you get out of ""Ride Along 2"" depends on how funny you find Hart as his nonstop babbling predictably generates most of the laughs. Ken Jeongs hacker character A.J. also has some moments but the two often feel like theyre trying too hard to earn those laughs.More successful are Ice Cubes smooth rebuttals to Harts outrageous behavior. But while Harts energy and Ice Cubes no-nonsense deadpan stare are at times amusing their antics arent enough to carry a film for an hour and 42 minutes.The movie has a good bit of action with a foot chase through multiple homes a car chase that morphs into a video game a high-stakes break-in complete with a bad CGI crocodile and unrealistic explosions and flames in the final boss showdown.But the plot is nothing new and the characters are nothing we havent seen before. Munns Maya does little more than coldly take down bad guys with a single-handed death grip drive a big red truck and don a sexy dress to distract Antonio only to be reduced to a nervous stuttering girl when asked on a date.At best ""Ride Along 2"" is what youve seen in every other comedic cop movie.

(Photo Credit Quantrell D. Colbe) Movie review of ""Ride Along 2"" Ice Cube and Kevin Hart cant rekindle the comedic adequacy of ""Ride Along."" Rating 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Well you knew this had to be coming. ""Ride Along"" was a hit in early 2014 coasting on the agreeable chemistry of stars Ice Cube and Kevin Hart as respectively a no-nonsense cop and a motor-mouthed cop wannabe. Now theyre back in ""Ride Along 2"" with Cubes long-suffering James having made peace more or less with Harts eager Ben -- and with the fact that Bens about to marry James sister Angela (Tika Sumpter). Bens now a cop and hes eager to insert himself into James latest case involving a Miami drug ring and a hacker and a rich guy and ... Sorry I nodded off there for a minute; ""Ride Along 2"" despite the best efforts of Cube and Hart is very very dull. Were the screenwriters hoping Hart would improvise the jokes as he went along? Or thinking that fond memories of ""Miami Vice"" would guide the audience through? Or maybe they didnt write a screenplay at all but just patched together dialogue from every buddy-cop and/or drug-ring movie ever made leaving out the good parts? Hart has a bit of fun as Ben gamely tries to get James to go along with their team nickname -- ""The Brothers-in-Law"" with the exclamation point audible -- and Cube again demonstrates hes a master of exasperated deadpan but the rest of the cast flails (particularly Olivia Munn as a fellow cop who seems to have confused ""unflappable"" with ""robotic""). Even Bens video-game buddy Assface (Erin Goins) from the first film has little to do -- a terrible waste as his name is one of the movies funnier bits. Come back Assface; this movie needs you. Movie Review 1/2   Ride Along 2 with Ice Cube Kevin Hart Ken Jeong Benjamin Bratt Olivia Munn Bruce McGill Tika Sumpter Sherri Shepherd Erin Goins. Directed by Tim Story from a screenplay by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. 102 minutes Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence sexual content language and some drug material. Several theaters.

Photo Quantrell D. Colbert/Universal Pictures via AP MOVIE REVIEW Ride Along 2 Running time 102 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity violence sexual content drug material). Whenever film critics are accused of having the best job on the planet the two-word retort is obvious ""Ride Along."" That one looks like ""Annie Hall"" compared to ""Ride Along 2."" To call ""Ride Along 2"" rubbish is unfair to rubbish which at some point had a purpose. This movie has all the focus of a housefly the thrills of an EPA manual the edge of a billiard ball. Its as funny as lead poisoning as deep as a fingernail as imaginative as a pothole. I didnt like it. Returning as Ben Barber now a rookie cop Kevin Hart again does his thing which is to climb atop a chair so he can get his head caught in a ceiling fan get punched in the gonads get tricked into eating hair-covered nachos he finds in the trash have his shoe bitten off by an alligator and get dragged behind a powerboat on his wedding day. You cant say Hart doesnt suffer for his art but unfortunately he made me suffer too. Bens future brother-in-law (""Were the BROTHERS in LAW"" Hart exclaims several times too many) is hard-core detective James Payton (Ice Cube) whose sister (Tika Sumpter) is about to marry Ben. Meanwhile because Atlanta cops frequently work out of Florida they head to Miami where they try to nab a drug lord (Benjamin Bratt doing a Ricardo Montalban accent) whose tech guy (Ken Jeong) proves easily persuaded to give up his boss. Ice CubePhoto Universal Pictures Chatty Ben and grouchy James hang out at beaches and dance clubs and anyplace else where the female attire tends to be skimpy such as a bikini shop where the customers as well as the mannequins are all wearing bikinis. In a pinch though none of these excuses is really necessary A lady detective (Olivia Munn) working the case with them simply pulls up in her car late at night wearing a sports bra because how else do female cops dress when tracking down leads? In whipping up the banter for the two lead actors screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi deliver such excruciation that their names should become synonymous with embarrassment and woe. Back acne should be renamed after them or pus or scrofula. They have Ben wear a white outfit so James can retort that Ben looks like a ""marshmallow."" When a car blows up they have Ben say ""Do you have any idea what your insurance is going to do?"" They have James reply to Bens babbling about police technique with ""Why dont we try the shut-the-hell-up technique."" They have the bad guy announce ""Im really really rich."" Every so often theres a meaningless shootout or Ben and James simply punch each other randomly in the face. Youd think ""Ride Along 2"" would at least be breezy and loose. Instead its plodding and low-energy. Its less a movie than a grim winter endurance test. Each minute passes like its own individual January.

""Characters""? If they mean Ice Cube reprising his stolid portrayal of a block of granite and Kevin Hart further wearing out his big-screen welcome as a ""shrieking"" (to quote the film) loudmouth then ""characters"" is far too generous a term for the barely-there personages that these actors have been asked to revive. See Video Ice Cube Kevin Hart Tear Up Miami in First Ride Along 2 Trailer Once again these talented performers are paired with director Tim Story who found genuine laughs -- and yes actual characters -- with them in ""Barbershop"" and ""Think Like a Man."" In the ""Ride Along"" movies however both the stars and the filmmaker are phoning it in mistaking volume for wit and punches for punchlines. Its a dispiriting waste of abilities on both sides of the camera. This go-round sees yappy video-gamer Ben (Hart) as a police academy graduate and probationary officer who nonetheless sees himself as a bigger fish on the force tagging along with his future brother-in-law James (Cube) on a drug bust that leads to massive destruction of property as well as injury to James partner. (The unlucky cop is played by Tyrese Gibson whose presence underscores the fact that Story doesnt know how to stage a muscle-cars-and-sexy-ladies sequence nearly as well as any of the ""Fast and Furious"" directors.) Also Read Why Kevin Hart Ice Cubes Ride Along 2 Can Take Down Star Wars The drug dealers flash drive leads James to Miami hacker A.J. (Ken Jeong giving his stock obnoxious second-banana performance). Ben insists on accompanying James to South Beach and while the seasoned cop at first refuses he finally relents in the hopes that Ben will learn some humility once he inevitably messes everything up. (Its also a favor to James sister bride-to-be Angela (Tika Sumpter) who wants Ben out of her hair so she can finalize arrangements with wedding planner Sherri Shepherd; like the rest of the cast Shepherd is given nothing funny to do or say.) Ride Along 2 What ensues is a tired retread of the already listless events of the first ""Ride Along"" with Ben trying James (and the audiences) patience with his shrill outbursts while heroically drawing upon his video game achievements in real-life situations. (The ""Ride Along"" movies offer adolescents of all ages the same vicarious fantasy as ""Pixels"" namely that the lessons learned in Call of Duty will miraculously translate to real life.) The only new element here is Olivia Munn as a Miami detective whose skill at disabling James via soft-tissue manipulation makes her an instant love interest for James. This movie doesnt waste her talents quite as much as ""Mortdecai"" did - Munn at least gets to do some sensuous salsa dancing with bad-guy Benjamin Bratt - but when you compare her big screen roles with the richness of her work on ""The Newsroom"" its no wonder so many actresses flee to television. As for Kevin Hart and Ice Cube theyre forced to play the same loud-guy-fuming-guy bits over and over throughout the film reducing them to a fifth-rate version of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo only heavily armed. See Video Ice Cube Gives The Bachelor Dating Advice Hennessy and Condoms From gleaming cars cruising past the ocean to bikini-clad models taking outdoor showers theres not a Miami Beach cliche that Story and cinematographer Mitchell Amundsen (""Transformers"") can resist; the only moment thats of any visual interest comes when a car chase turns into something out of Grand Theft Auto Vice City in Bens PlayStation-programmed mind. The films most genuinely funny moment involves A.J.s ringtones which should perhaps come as no surprise -- the stakes and the laughs are so small that ""Ride Along 2"" was apparently designed to be watched on your phone.

And theyre really doing it all over again. Ride Along 2 which moves the action from Atlanta to Miami plays more like a remake than a sequel. It worked the first time right? Ben is still desperate to prove himself (this time as a detective) to both his future bride (Tika Sumpter) and James who concocts an intense on-the-job test to scare him off. Eventually Ben displays his unexpected worth and together he and James take down an otherwise untouchable crime boss played this time by Benjamin Bratt. The films are so note-for-note similar that its easy to visualize a split-screen YouTube comparison video if you can imagine such a horror. Like last time Harts manic energy is just enough to keep the film afloat as it plods from chase scene to stakeout to chase scene while Ice Cube scowls. The most noticeable difference between the two movies--besides a slightly higher laugh count thanks to Hart as well as Ken Jeong as a criminal hacker--is that Ride Along 2 has the secondary mission of inventing reasons to ogle Olivia Munn costarring as the Miami detective who comes to crime scenes straight from the gym sweaty and still wearing her sports bra. Action comedies must seem like no-brainers for quadrant-minded studios. Audiences like laughs and explosions so why not have both? In practice though hybrid movies typically end up as comedies where the star shoots a gun from time to time. Or its the other way around and the action works but the jokes arent quite funny-funny--the obvious exceptions being the 21 Jump Street movies which makes you think Shouldnt Ice Cube know better?

About halfway through the sequel to Universals 2014 hit ""Ride Along"" there comes a moment when Kevin Hart must sift through a trashcan and take a bite of some discarded nachos though not before reaching in and picking out a large clump of hair. Like many of the gags on display here -- say Ken Jeong indulging in cyber-foreplay with a girl dressed as a giant mouse or Ice Cubes car blowing up -- the scene serves no particular narrative purpose. But it does supply a fairly spot-on metaphor Hart is the audience the trashcan is the month of January and the tray of refried slop and congealed cheese being ingested is ""Ride Along 2"" another tired witless and potentially lucrative attempt to spin an exhausted buddy-cop template into action-comedy gold. If youre wondering what the hair represents youre already giving the movie more thought than anyone else has. Those who saw the first ""Ride Along"" may well have forgotten how it ended with diminutive Atlanta security guard Ben Barber (Hart) proposing to his doting girlfriend Angela (Tika Sumpter) with the reluctant blessing of her detective brother James (Cube). Scripted by Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi (two of the first films four credited screenwriters) ""Ride Along 2"" picks up with Ben and Angelas wedding just around the corner and the fact that so little time has passed is just one reason the movie feels like such a slog from the get-go. Although hes now a rookie police officer Ben is still an obnoxious accident-prone motormouth while James remains little more than a scowl with a badge determined to show Ben just how ill suited he is for law enforcement. When Bens fast-talking slow-thinking shenanigans lead to the shooting of another detective (a cameo by Tyrese Gibson on loan from Universals ""Fast and the Furious"" franchise) James persuades Atlanta PD to send him and his brother-in-law-to-be to Miami where theyre tailing a hacker who might lead them to his crime-kingpin boss. For James its another opportunity to get rid of ""the dwarf"" once and for all; for Ben its a chance to prove himself on the force and enjoy the bachelor party of his dreams. And sure enough Story lets us soak up the sights and sounds of the Magic City whether hes crowding the frame with bikini-clad bodies staging a foot chase through the back alleys of Little Havana or having Hart belch fire and tear up the dance floor at a nightclub (actually an Atlanta soundstage but whatever). But the two cops respective plans go awry when they come face-to-face with the hacker AJ (Jeong) a resourceful geek whom James dismisses as ""a low-budget-ass Jackie Chan"" perhaps in an attempt to stir fond memories of ""Rush Hour."" If only The filmmakers deserve some credit for attempting to further diversify their mostly non-white ensemble a choice that pays off with one kinda-funny line when James accuses AJ of dodging him just because hes black (""Look at you You would run from you"" AJ replies). What theyve really demonstrated unfortunately is that mediocrity is wholly color-blind Nobody here whether black white Asian or Latino is permitted to say or do anything of interest -- not Antonio Pope (a bored-looking Benjamin Bratt) a wealthy philanthropist who is soon revealed as the murderous drug lord and certainly not local detective Maya (Olivia Munn) trotted out as a tough-minded love interest for James. Although Mayas smarts are ultimately set aside in favor of her shapelier attributes -- as when she stages a diversion by getting hot and heavy with Antonio on the dance floor -- shes treated with marginally more respect than the other women on screen like the pretty vacant Angela and her increasingly fascistic wedding planner Cori (Sherri Shepherd). But really this is no ones idea of an actors showcase Jeong a wily and irrepressible comic talent is best known for teaching Spanish on ""Community"" and baring all in ""The Hangover"" movies and those achievements are unlikely to be eclipsed by his uninspired third-wheel turn here. As for the manic Hart and the surly Cube they had a hard enough time breathing fresh life into this stale formula the first time around and seem content to spin their wheels while hopefully contemplating a career shift away from the Story franchise factory. The tediously over-explained plot chokes and sputters along and many of the action set pieces simply smack of desperation never more so than when Ben finds himself trapped in Antonios backyard with a jumbo alligator. There is one diverting car chase however in which Ben drawing on his video-game addiction skillfully outmaneuvers one vehicle after another -- a sequence that finds editor Peter S. Elliot cutting briskly between live-action footage and a ""Grand Theft Auto""-style simulation. Its somehow fitting that ""Ride Along 2"" springs to life in those moments when it most clearly resembles the non-movie it is.

The first ""Ride Along"" - which paired over-eager wannabe cop Kevin Hart with tough veteran Ice Cube -- was dumb too. But theres a difference between being dumb and being stupid. The fatal mistake this film makes is the way it crudely simplifies its characters - with Harts never-learning newbie constantly getting in trouble and the slow-burning Ice Cube always telling him off. We get the situation straight off - one man is an idiot and the other is a grouch.But once we get it it doesnt go anywhere. Sure the stooge-and-straight-man idea is an old one - Laurel and Hardy Abbott and Costello Hope and Crosby. But it only works when the cocky straight man is flawed too. It might be his dopey buddy who gets them into trouble but when it happens theyre both scared silly. And its the straight mans ultimate vulnerability that reveals his gruff-and-grouchy act as just an act and easy to forgive. However as a star (and producer) Ice Cube refuses to lose his dignity. He wont play silly. He definitely wont play scared. And so the movies balance gets thrown off. Hart says something dumb and Ice Cube glares at him. Hart makes a mistake and Ice Cube chews him out. Its not a movie about odd-couple friends but about an annoying screw-up and a humorless bully. And what fun is that? The first film at least had the virtue of novelty - it was interesting for a while to see how the two actors interacted - but by now theyre locked into their roles and a familiar strictly pro-forma plot. This time the action switches from Atlanta to Miami where the two are on the trail of a drug-smuggling witness (who turns out to be the perpetually unfunny Ken Jeong). But its still the same numbskull action comedy with bullets flying and cars blowing up. There are a few extra additions. Benjamin Bratt - who purrs his lines with such old-fashioned relish I expected him to start talking about ""rich Corinthian leather"" -- is a villainous drug lord. Olivia Munn shows up as a Miami detective with some mean dance moves. And theres at least one good scene in which Harts character - whos addicted to video games - triumphs in a harrowing chase by remembering his strategies from his favorite ""Grand Theft Auto"" sessions. The problem is those video games have more heart than this movie. And a much smarter sense of what theyre really all about and the honest source of their own appeal. Hart may be playing dumb but its the filmmakers who dont have a clue. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Ride Along 2 (PG-13) Universal (101 min.) Directed by Tim Story.

A hundred-minute brief on Hollywoods lack of imagination? Grist for future essays about how quickly the idea of Ice ""Fuck tha Police"" Cube playing a gun-happy hero cop became routine? Whatever you make of Ride Along 2 beforehand is certain to be what you make of it as you cruise with it. Tim Storys sequel -- to a buddy-cop comedy that itself was only ""original"" in the legal sense -- is made up entirely of scenes youve seen before starring actors youre familiar with doing the kinds of things that they usually do. Like your smartphone its a testament to the theory of interchangeable parts a perfectly engineered product that if youre charitable you might also think of in terms of art. Theres certainly culture-pretzeled weirdness to behold here some of it deliberate the tense early scene where Cube confronts Atlantas top drug dealer a scary white man until pipsqueak Kevin Hart bounces up in a low-rider Impala bumping Iggy Azaleas ""Fancy""? When I fire my pistol you can start your think pieces.But every time I started to believe that theres some parodic impulse behind the filmmakers recasting of cliches Cubes character would punch a suspect in custody or commit some other violation of civil liberties that the film invites us to cheer. In the tradition of Police Academy sequels a big case compels the bickering cops of Ride Along to journey to Miami. You may wonder Is it a gag that the establishing shots of cityscapes are spliced together with establishing shots of asses Fast amp; Furious-style? In the future will filmmakers dispense with the cityscapes altogether and just set the scene with region-specific booty?Film Details Ride Along 2 RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time101 min. More Info Trailer As the film barrels along Storys cheery leering proves itself a directorial hallmark. Its a staple of cop movies that Olivia Munn as a tough-cookie Miami homicide detective must showcase spectacular cleavage during the sequence in which the heroes infiltrate a gala at a billionaires home. But Story and company go above and beyond contriving to have her show up at a crime scene fresh from pilates -- and go about her police work in her sports bra.But like the crowd I saw this with I laughed quite a bit. (They applauded even.) For once the worst gag -- a weakly staged encounter between Hart and a CGI alligator -- is the one spoiled in the trailers. Again Hart plays a rookie wannabe eager to team up with Cubes movie-cop badass and again Cubes character has to deal with the fact that Harts has won the love of his sister. The drama this time isnt just whether theyll bring down the villain you know theyll bring down. Its whether Cube will say something nice in a toast at the climactic wedding.Kevin Hart movies belong to Hart the way Sonny Rollins albums belong to Sonny.In the years since Barbershop (2002) Story has backed away from personal style in favor of sturdy scene-by-scene competence. As in the first Ride Along hes not pushy as he sets up the gags and even the ones where you can see the joke coming never go exactly the way you might expect. When Hart here stands on top of a chair and then on top of a table you know hes going to get his noggin knocked by the ceiling fan but Story trusts his actor to dictate the timing. Later a backyard foot chase keeps topping itself with Hart and Ken Jeong crashing through barbecues scrambling over fences and vaulting off trampolines -- as the mayhem escalates the hilarity does too which is rare in noisy action set pieces. Throughout Story never loses sight of the eccentric specificities of these performers even in the not-bad car chase which Harts character the driver gets through by envisioning it all as Grand Theft Auto. Thats kind of what the pre-viz teams do with blockbuster action scenes already so lets credit Ride Along 2 with one more satiric point. (Another suggestion of more thoughtful intentions KRS-Ones furious ""Sound of da Police"" booms over the end credits.)Story isnt always generous with his performers. Munns detective leads the villain (a lean and wicked Benjamin Bratt) through seductive paces on the dance floor but we never really get to see these stars glide together. Instead the film keeps cutting to Hart yelling at that gator. Cube meanwhile is fine as the tough guy who melts just a little at his admirers pluck.The Ride Along series casts Hart as a Melissa McCarthy character the person everyone overlooks but who could achieve greatness. Hart has played that before but unlike McCarthy he doesnt have a sympathetic Paul Feig to build a Spy around him -- a careful caring movie that convinces us to believe in its lead. Instead Ride Along is another revue-like setting for its star to demonstrate his chops.Kevin Hart movies belong to Kevin Hart the way Sonny Rollins albums belong to Sonny no matter whos in the band. Hart doesnt get as much solo time here as he did in The Wedding Ringer -- a shaky film that still cannily showcased both his anarchic yapping and his leading-man suavity -- and on occasion the direction he seems to have been given is ""Be loud and annoying for a couple minutes."" But as in his stand-up Hart dazzles when he has material worth his considerable motormouth talents. His hilarious rants here about the meanings of ringtones or how his and Cubes characters should call themselves ""The Brothers-in-Law"" or how much surviving a police shootout would hurt? Theyll forever be highlights of his already swollen highlight reel.Ride Along 2 Directed by Tim Story Universal Pictures Opens January 15 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.
