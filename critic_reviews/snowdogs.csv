A featherweight throwback to the willy-nilly silliness of Disney comedies produced in the 1970s ""Snow Dogs"" should benefit from lack of similar family fare on current megaplex bills; decent opening-weekend grosses may snowball into a tidy sum for the Mouse House. Small children will be amused by the frenetic antics of Cuba Gooding Jr. as a city slicker whos improbably transported to the Alaskan wilds and compelled to grasp the finer points of dog-sled racing. Grownups however will be far less enchanted. Gooding plays Ted Brooks a successful dentist with a string of profit-churning clinics in Miami. Amelia (Nichelle Nichols) his proud widowed mother has never had the nerve to tell him that he was adopted. But Ted learns thetruth on his own when hes told his real mother recently died in the remote Alaskan hamlet of Tolketna. So Ted heads north to settle hismothers estate and if possible learn something about his roots. Once in Tolketna hes attracted to Barb (Joanna Bacalso) a beautiful tavern owner and intimidated by Thunder Jack (James Coburn) a crusty cranky dog-racing champ. Jack wants to buy the entire team of sled dogs raised and trained by Teds mom. At first Ted is sorely tempted to make a quick sale since hes unable to cope with Demon leader of the pack and the other hard-to-handle canines. But Ted changes his mind and decides to stick around when he learns that Jack although conspicuously white is his biological father. ""Snow Dogs"" plays the race card very carefully and mostly for easy laughs. At one point Amelia notes that her adopted sons Caucasian background would explain ""why youre so crazy about that Michael Bolton."" A nice touch Bolton himself pops up in a dream sequence for some good-sport self-parody. Coburn makes it very clear in his effectively understated performance that theres no racist motive behind Jacks gruff refusal to accept Ted as his offspring or his extreme reluctance to talk about Teds mother. Hessimplytoo set in his ways -- and perhaps too regretful about choices made and opportunities missed -- to greet Ted with open arms. But of course the apple doesnt fall far from the tree even when covered with snow. Ted doggedly attempts to master the art of mushing despite the lack of cooperation from Demon and his four-legged teammates. Practice doesnt exactly make perfect but Ted learns enough to lend a hand when Jack is lost during the Arctic Challenge a cross-country competition said to be the most grueling dog-sled race ""next to the Iditarod."" Speaking of the Iditarod No fewer than five scriptwriters are credited with adapting James Paulsens 1994 nonfiction book ""Winterdance The Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod."" Its hard to shake the suspicion that each scribe in turn made the scenario a little less fact-based a little more generic while changing names smoothing edges and pushing material ever closer toward the lowest common denominator. Gooding flails his arms bugs his eyes and tumbles through pratfallsmore than he has to pitching his performance toward the pics target audience (i.e. small children whose parents wont object to a few jokes about doggie wee-wee). Director Brian Levant (""The Flintstones"" ""Jingle All the Way"") fails to finesse the pacing -- ""Snow Dogs"" seems ready to end at least twice before it actually does -- and doesnt do much with throwaway bits that may have originally been intended as more substantial running gags. Chief among the latter A couple of appearances by Jean-Michel Pare as a vainglorious commercially endorsed dog-racer. On the other hand Levant wisely underplays the amusing f/x trickery that allows Demon and the other sled dogs to occasionally express themselves (to one another not to humans) with winks grins raised eyebrows and fluttering eyelashes. In the aforementioned dream sequence the sled dogs relax in folding chairs on a sandy beach while conversing with Ted. (Jim Belushi gets billing as Demons voice while Jim Hensons Creature Shop is credited with constructing the animatronic version of the dog.) Throughout rest of ""Snow Dogs"" though title characters are rendered with appreciably more realism.

"USATODAY.com - Snow Dogs in a word Mush Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 01/18/2002 - Updated 1210 AM ET Snow Dogs in a word Mush By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Snow Dogs (out of four) Stars Cuba Gooding Jr. James Coburn Nichelle Nichols Sisqo Director Brian Levant Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating PG for mild crude humor Opens today nationwide The best actor in Snow Dogs is a glowering Siberian husky named Demon. In fact all the dogs in the movie do a better job than their human counterparts. Thats not because theyre particularly expressive. Though theyre adorable animals they talk only in a dream sequence. Nor are they given much screen time. But the two-legged actors are either so underwhelming or so histrionic that the lead husky looks like Orson Welles by comparison. Read more below Related item Gooding is top dog Video Snow Dogs trailer Its not that we would expect much from director Brian Levant after such misfires as The Flintstones and Jingle All the Way. And five screenwriters are credited with the cliche-laden screenplay; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before. What were left with is a slapstick comedy that only young children are bound to enjoy. Adults will likely be disappointed that talented actors Cuba Gooding Jr. and James Coburn (both Oscar winners no less) couldnt raise this movie to a higher level. Gooding is occasionally engaging as Ted Brooks a dentist with a thriving practice in Miami. He learns that he was adopted and that his birth mother has died and named him in her will. He takes a harrowing single-engine-plane trip to Tolketna a remote town in Alaska inhabited by a craggy bunch of rugged individualists and eccentrics. (Theres a surprise.) But their local tavern is run by the beautiful and exotic Barb (Joanna Bacalso) who appears to be the only human female around for miles. Hard to understand why a twentysomething babe would live in a town filled with such grizzled male specimens. She is understandably drawn to Ted who is youthful funny handsome and apparently the only man in Alaska with a full set of teeth. (There are far too many toothless men complaining of their rank breath in this movie. Perhaps each of the five writers added their own spin on that wan joke?) When Ted discovers that the gruffest loner is his biological dad (James Coburn) he tries to bond with the nasty old coot by appealing to the old mans love of dog sledding ""I need to learn to mush and you need to learn to floss."" And in typical improbable fashion he masters the art of dog sledding within days and even saves a life. When I asked my 8-year-old if this seemed plausible to her she sagely replied ""Its not supposed to be realistic. Its Disney.""

IN WALT DISNEY COMEDY ""SNOW DOGS."" CUBA GOODING JR. IN WALT DISNEY COMEDY ""SNOW DOGS."" Photo HO Avalanche should bury Snow Dogs / Cuba Gooding Jr. cant rescue plot 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SNOW DOGS Comedy. Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. Produced by Jordan Kerner. Directed by Brian Levant. (PG. At Bay Area theaters. 99 minutes.) Dont let this dog out -- please. Walt Disneys ""Snow Dogs"" includes a barf joke in its first three minutes; a panorama of sweaty female flesh in the first five; and a product placement in the first seven. All of which sets the tone for the remaining hour and a half of hackneyed direction implausible plot twists and ham-fisted acting. When a cameo by crooner Michael Bolton is the highlight of a movie -- unless one counts rapper Sisqos turn as a bottle-blond dentist -- its definitely flop-sweat time. Under the direction of Brian Levant (whose credits include ""Beethoven"" another stellar moment in Disney cinema) the narrative of ""Snow Dogs"" follows the old fish-out-of-water template. Miami dentist Ted Brooks (Cuba Gooding Jr. ) discovers hes adopted -- somehow hes reached adulthood without his adoptive mother (Nichelle Nichols) bothering to tell him -- when hes summoned to Alaska for the reading of his birth mothers will. Comedy attempts to ensue as urbane Floridian Brooks befriends the rough-but- ready ethnically diverse folk up north one of whom Barb (Joanna Bacalso) looks like a haute couture model miraculously transported via ice floe from the runways of Paris. Such is Alaska. But theres more It turns out that Brooks biological father (James Coburn) is the town curmudgeon and white as jaundiced snow. It also turns out that Brooks biological mother has left him a team of demonic sled dogs whose natural doggy style is embellished by digital effects enabling them to wink and leer malevolently. All this -- model curmudgeonly father hounds of hell -- improbably convinces Brooks that he must show em all by becoming a championship musher in time for the Arctic Challenge Sled Dog Races. This gives him about oh two weeks. Why not? From the studio that taught Wendy to fly anything is possible. The story unfolds in the expected way Icy hearts melt love blossoms in front of snowy silk-screen backdrops animals mug for the camera triumph turns to tragedy turns to triumph and rustic simplicity trumps the urban life. Given the plodding predictability the actors are left little to work with. The boredom shows. Gooding appears alternately befuddled and depressed. Bacalso smiles with toothy elan (a real-life former model shes had practice at this). Aware that he deserves better veteran actor Coburn chews the scenery with gusto. Graham Greene who won acclaim playing an Indian in ""Dances With Wolves"" and has been typecast ever since cant seem to decide whether to overact or sleepwalk through his role as an indigenous Alaskan. Theres little to recommend ""Snow Dogs"" unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity. Levant and Disney have created an alternative universe in which people still use antiquated terms like ""city slicker"" and mouth lines like ""Why dont we step outside and settle this Eskimo style?"" Ironically Disneys live-action films wander further from reality than its animated fare. At least the characters in ""The Lion King"" are believable.
