More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Starring Denzel Washington Angelina Jolie Queen Latifah Mike McGlone and Luis Guzman. Directed by Phillip Noyce. (R. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Denzel Washington is such a graceful actor. He communicates a sense of being comfortable in his body which may be why he often is cast as an athlete or military officer. Even when hes in a dud theres a payoff just in watching him move. But Washington is immobile during most of his new film ""The Bone Collector."" As Lincoln Rhyme ace forensics expert with the New York Police Department he is hit with a beam in the first scene while unearthing a body in the bowels of a subway station. After the accident his only functioning parts as Rhyme dryly puts it are ""a finger two shoulders and a brain."" Related Stories `Bone Collector Needs New Hobby / Washington stars in illogical thriller ROBBING THE STAR OF POWER Any movie that takes away the source of much of its stars power better have something equally strong to offer. Angelina Jolie provides a jolt in her first big movie role as a police officer whom Rhyme trains to do his fieldwork for him. Yet even with her sexy presence a pumped-up soundtrack and soaring shots of the Manhattan skyline ""The Bone Collector"" often falls flat. The premise of a clever sadistic serial killer leaving clues to his next heinous crime was more convincing in ""Seven."" Some of Rhymes deductions have no rhyme or reason. Lying flat on his back with grisly clues such as pieces of bone and skin projected overhead he is able to figure out in short order that the murderer a New York cabbie is copying sadistic acts from 100 years ago. Rhyme then pinpoints the location of the killers next attack. When it turns out to be a turn-of-the-century slaughterhouse Rhyme deduces which one. The script by Jeremy Iacone (based on a best-seller by Jeffrey Deaver) would have been more credible if like Sherlock Holmes this detective was wrong at least once. And isnt it a bit obvious to have Rhymes loyal caretaker played with gusto by rap singer Queen Latifah addicted to putting together puzzles? PASS ON THAT CAB While were on the subject of obvious attached to the rearview mirror of the madmans cab is a little doll with its head in a noose. Wouldnt wary New Yorkers bolt when they get a look at that? (Cab drivers arent going to be thrilled by this movie; all they need is for passengers to worry about being hauled off to a slaughterhouse.) ""The Bone Collector"" works better as a romance than as a thriller. The films romantic bent isnt immediately apparent but it can be pieced together by carefully studying the clues. Start with the introduction of Jolies character Amelia Donaghy. Based on her actions upon discovering the killers first victim Rhyme declares she has a gift for forensics -- which she knows nothing about -- and insists she is the only one who can help him solve the crimes. Surely the NYPD has people more qualified. Could it be he just likes having her around? Director Phillip Noyce uses closeups of Rhyme watching his assistant. There are harder faces to watch. Exchanging looks its obvious they have eyes for each other. GROWING ATTRACTION When Donaghy goes out to a crime site Rhyme talks her through it whispering in her ear through an earpiece. Its all very intimate. By the time she runs a hand across his inert body its obvious where things are heading. Its charismatic stars are the main thing ""The Bone Collector"" has going for it. Jolie is Jon Voights daughter and looks just the way he did in ""Midnight Cowboy."" Judging from the way she holds the big screen movie audiences will be seeing a lot more of her. Asked to do most of his emoting through his eyes Washingtons intelligence shines through. If anyone can make the idea of an infallible detective believable hes the actor to do it. ..

The obvious difficulties in making an action thriller out of Jeffery Deavers best-selling fiction ""The Bone Collector"" -which pivots on a paralyzed protagonists solving a serial murder case while bedridden -arent entirely surmounted in Phillip Noyces glossy adaptation. While Denzel Washington delivers a convincing central turn suspense is inevitably somewhat compromised by protags physical stasis; perhaps more serious flaws however lie in Angelina Jolies credulity-straining role and a narrative that keeps the killers identity and motives unknown until a hyperbolic contrived climax. Entertaining but never fully engrossing this Universal-Columbia co-production -- which preemed in Montreal where Manhattan-set story was primarily shot -- looks likely to post midrange b.o. when it rolls out Stateside on Nov. 5. Opening seg reveals the accident that left brilliant NYPD criminologist Lincoln Rhyme (Washington) paralyzed below the shoulders save one finger -- falling debris crushed him while locating a slain cop in the subway systems bowels. Waking once again from this grim recall four years later (though that time passage isnt made very clear) Rhyme passes days in unhappy retirement tended by omnipresent nurse Thelma (Queen Latifah) and occasional visits from medical technician Richard (Leland Orser). Hes privately asked a physician friend to arrange his ""final transition"" i.e. suicide -- he dreads surviving as a ""vegetable"" once recurrent seizures from spinal-fluid buildup wreak their cumulative and seemingly inevitable effect. But Rhymes former partner Det. Sellitto (Ed ONeill) thinks only his uncanny deduction skills can help in finding a multimillionaire and his wife who disappeared after entering an airport taxi the day before. Patrol cop Amelia Donaghy (Jolie) discovers the mans corpse buried beneath subway tracks with a hand (including one skinned-to-the-bone finger) protruding upward-and its her quick thinking that preserves clues purposely left behind from being decimated by a passing Amtrak train and falling rain. The kidnapped woman is presumed still alive; but as we learn well before the authorities do shes in immediate jeopardy manacled by the ski-masked slayer in another underground city site. Scanning the clues Donaghy had photographed on his elaborate home computer apparati Rhyme is able to pinpoint a likely hostage location. But Sellitto younger Det. Solomon (Mike McGlone) and Donaghy arrive at the scene too late to save the woman from her grisly fate being scalded to death by a point-blank steam pipes timed emission. Story throws out its major barrier to credibility at this early point as Rhyme-who puts no stock in the capability of his departmental nemesis Chief of Crime Scenes Howard Cheney (a glowering Michael Rooker)-insists beat cop Donaghy be the first to investigate this and later crime scenes alone. Were meant to buy that he perceives a ""natural ability"" in her (the de rigeur romantic attraction comes later). But notion that hed forgo any other trusted fellow detectives bend rules and enrage Cheney to use this completely inexperienced-not to mention extremely discomfited- officer as his eyes and ears handling all-important evidence strains viewer belief to a serious degree. Jolies glam looks (its duly explained later that character is an ex-model) further underline the contrivance though the rising thesp (""Gia"" ""Playing by Heart"") tries her level best to put the role across. Abduction of a young male whod hailed the murderous cab driver -- then later an elderly man and grandchild -- further suggest that Rhyme amp; Co. are being cat-and-moused; clues eventually point toward the assailants recreation of crimes from the turn of the century in the same location. Cheney forcibly takes over the investigation. But Donaghy-by now willingly attuned to the hunt-risks her career with additional sleuthing. She realizes in the last lap that Rhyme himself may be endangered. Hitherto mercifully restrained in its depictions despite the grotesque nature of two first murders pic orchestrates a bloody climactic confrontation in heros spacious loft apartment. The action is pulse-quickening but payoff suffers from the weakness of killers proffered explanation -which comes out of left field and reveals little satisfying reason for the choice of victims or violent methods. Coda ignores Rhymes prior fears and suicidal intent to provide a cliched uptempo fade. Presumably Deavers novel compensated for narrative faults via character depth particularly in Rhymes p.o.v. as a man whose high intelligence hasnt made his disability any easier to cope with. Washington has no trouble convincing us on either level; denied the usual range of physical role expression he compellingly anchors the film nonetheless. But Jeremy Iacones (""One Tough Cop"") screenplay doesnt provide much in the way of character backstory or deep relationships to fully articulate immobilized protags human dimension. More poignancy should be mined from his isolation since dutiful Thelma (who never seems to go home; too bad Latifah seldom gets anything more than silent reaction shots) appears his sole significant companion by choice. Its not Jolies fault that the late-breaking romance comes off as all-too-convenient and formulaic. Subsidary roles are well-cast with Luis Guzman contributing some comic relief as an antic forensics specialist. Helmer Noyce is on familiar turf with another mainstream suspenser; confident pacing subterranean atmospherics and a few false scares maintain middling tension but pics smooth handling doesnt really get under the skin in the manner of some other recent serial-killer thrillers. Production values are high-grade. Dean Semlers widescreen lensing keeps things as fluid as possible during the apartment-bound scenes often filling transitions with handsome NYC aerial views. Theres a notable trick shot that fakes a reverse speed zoom over great distances. Other major contributions including Craig Armstrongs moody score are effective if conventional.

"Bone Collector A Taxi Ride to Torture Provokes a Chase November 5 1999 FILM REVIEW Bone Collector A Taxi Ride to Torture Provokes a Chase Related Articles The New York Times on the Web Current Film Video Selected Scenes and Trailer From the Film The Bone Collector Forum Join a Discussion on Current Film By STEPHEN HOLDEN ince movies keep pushing the envelope of the acceptably gruesome even the nastiest sights glimpsed in Phillip Noyces preposterous thriller ""Bone Collector"" should strike jaded moviegoers (those who relished ""Seven"" for instance) as ho-hum shocks. A woman found shackled in the bowels of New York and cooked alive by scalding steam resembles a giant oozing radish. A young man also held underground in shackles is discovered covered with squirming rats that when dispersed by a gunshot reveal his greedily picked-over body. Near the end of the film during a life-and-death tussle one character sinks his teeth into the jugular of his attacker and emerges looking like a vampire with unusually sloppy table manners. These unsettling moments have become par for the course in a modern horror thriller. And ""The Bone Collector"" which stars Denzel Washington as a brilliant forensic detective tracking down a serial killer who leaves elaborate clues near his victims bodies is an efficient purveyor of such stock genre jolts. In addition to corpses and gushing veins those jolts include the usual false alarms harsh musical clangs slowly turning doorknobs and menacing shadows. There is even one glowering character whom the movie blatantly manipulates us into assuming is the culprit. The killer meets his victims in a way that should tap into a paranoid New Yorkers worst nightmares. He picks them up in a taxi at the airport or Grand Central Terminal locks them in his car and speeds off into the middle of nowhere. Most find themselves strung up in deserted turn-of-the-century slaughterhouses and abandoned subway stations that resemble medieval torture chambers. Although there is nothing remotely believable about this drawn-out cat-and-mouse game of a movie crossed with a whodunit thats almost the point. ""The Bone Collector"" adapted from a novel by Jeffery Deaver is a cinematic game that might be called Urban Creep Show New York-style and its rules are comfortably predetermined. We can be pretty sure that the hero Lincoln Rhyme (Washington) a detective who has been a quadriplegic for four years and suffers from seizures any of which could reduce him to a vegetative state will outwit the demon killer. The gimmick is that Lincoln can solve the case without budging from bed. Using a computer and an illuminated viewing screen to pore over the evidence he is able to make impossible lightning-quick determinations about where the next victim is likely to found. Communicating by cell phone with Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) a beautiful young police officer (and former model) whom he has drafted as his assistant he instructs her on what to look for at the crime scene and how to handle the evidence. The role of Lincoln is a piece of cake for Washington who departs from his customary Boy Scout mode to display matching streaks of imperiousness and cunning. The film revels in close-ups of Washingtons handsome face whose glinting eyes and dazzling teeth do a seductive duet. The camera is even more enamored of Ms. Jolie with her impossibly sensual lips and eyes that brim with a soft melting fire. In sheer smoldering screen charisma Ms. Jolie has every other young Hollywood actress beat hands down. Whether she can really act remains to be seen. Because Lincoln is a quadriplegic the film suggests that there is little hope of a sexual relationship between him and Amelia. But in the same way that it delivers jarring false alarms the movie suggests an unacknowledged erotic heat between its stars. Unlike so many other screen couples nowadays these two have chemistry. PRODUCTION NOTES The Bone Collector is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has extremely gory moments and profanity. THE BONE COLLECTOR Directed by Phillip Noyce; written by Jeremy Iacone based on the book by Jeffery Deaver; director of photography Deam Semler; edited by William Hoy; music by Craig Armstrong; production designer Nigel Phelps; produced by Martin Bregman Louis A. Stroller and Michael Bregman; released by Universal Pictures. Running time 118 minutes. This film is rated R.
