"Paranormal Activity 3 review Lets go to the videotape -- again |       NJ.com comments Paranormal Activity 3 review Lets go to the videotape -- again Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 21 2011 at 716 AM View/Post Comments Paramount PicturesJust in time for Halloween ""Paranormal Activity 3"" is the story of an ordinary family dealing with extraordinary frights. You know that annoying roommate (or younger brother or friend) who used to jump out from behind a corner and yell ""Boo"" And youd say ""Thats not funny"" And then five minutes later hed do it again? If he were a movie hed be ""Paranormal Activity 3."" The series began four years ago with a microbudget and a ""Blair Witch""-style idea a ghost story told through the ""found"" video footage of a new homeowner trying to document whatever it was that was going bump in the night. It depended pretty heavily on cheap effects mostly sudden noises and slamming doors. But there was something charming about the low-tech approach and the commonplace nature of it all -- an ugly tract house no-name actors -- that made it more believable. A sequel was of course inevitable -- and interestingly functioned as a prequel showing us what had happened just before the first film. Now comes the third movie and it takes us back to the beginning to explain how it all began. But its more of the same -- and at this point thats not quite enough. Once again were in an ugly modern house all drab wall to wall and ugly lighting fixtures. Once again there are strange noises -- and a husband who films everything (even when hes running down the stairs in a panic). And once again it ends badly. The deliberately unknown cast includes Christopher Nicholas Smith as the videocam-crazy man and Lauren Bittner as the doubting mother. Chloe Csengery and Jessica Tyler Brown are the children and theyre particularly believable -- but then theyre closest to the age of imaginary friends and monsters-in-the-closet that this movie draws on. Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman have one neat film-school trick up their sleeves -- having Smith strap one camera to a slowly moving fan. That creates an inexorable pan and a little bit of aesthetic fun and games about whats in the frame and whats not -- with whats not seen often being the most important. But the rest of the film is still well someone jumping out every few minutes and yelling ""Boo"" (sometimes literally). Theres not much to the characters and the final twist doesnt make much sense in the context of the film let alone the entire series. To its credit the film goes quickly enough and it has a few jump-in-your-seat moments. If you havent seen the first two movies it might even seem novel. But if you havent seen the first two movies why are you watching this? And if you have seen the first two movies why do you need to watch this? Ratings note The film contains strong language violence drug use and sensuality. Paranormal Activity 3 (R) Paramount (84 min.) Directed by Henry Joost Ariel Schulman. With Christopher Nicholas Smith Lauren Bittner Chloe Csengery Jessica Tyler Brown. Now playing in New Jersey.

The shtick movie ""Paranormal Activity 3"" is the horror equivalent of vaudeville comedy a little patter a little pie in the face repeat. The two sisters who were possessed by household demons in the first two films this time are little girls back in 1988. Video cameras were approximately the size of Yugos but never mind the convenience factor. For no clear reason their stepdad Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) persists in videotaping the increasingly weird goings-on at his suburban California house even long after you or I would have moved out (or called 1-800-GHOSTBUSTERS). His behavior is eerie ... strange ... uncanny ... its almost like hes more interested in providing material for a horror movie than actually saving his life. And hes willing to lug around a giant camera recording everything even after he witnesses the life-threatening doings of ""Toby"" the imaginary friend of his apparently possessed daughter Kristi who tells her parents she and this unseen being like to talk about ""secrets"" that she cannot share. Mostly this movie is ""Paranormal Activity 2 1/2 ."" Unlike the first film which was genuinely inventive and exciting in taking a slightly new angle on the ""Blair Witch"" home-movie style the third episode is predictably ""shocking."" The way it sets itself up you know there is going to be 70 minutes of aggressive banality followed by 10 minutes of banal aggression. In the daytime scenes Dennis and his wife Julie (Lauren Bittner) talk about the various things that go bash and thump laugh nervously and discover whats on the videotapes they recorded with three stationary cameras overnight. In the night scenes we observe through the video cameras the couple sleeping their two daughters in their twin beds or the downstairs where (a slightly new wrinkle here) a camera is attached to a slowly oscillating fan meaning we can only see part of the room at any one time. Each of these scenes involves the supposed build-up of ""suspense"" which is really just killing time until we get to the punchline gag every five minutes or so. The experience is this Wait ... wait ... wait ... OH MY GOD SUCH A LOUD NOISE. A LAMP FELL Oh. A lamp fell. Cut repeat the above this time with a sheet or a bunch of pots or a kid suddenly sprinting past. You shriek (if youre an idiot anyway) then laugh because you feel stupid about how easily youve been played. And you wait for the big finale. Given that we know at the outset the two little girls must survive to be in the other two films things do not bode well for the grown-ups. In a way the movie is a small improvement on the dull second episode because it brings in a new background element that slightly enriches the story. But this factor doesnt make a lot of sense raises more questions than it answers and is anyway ripped off from a really famous horror movie. What was true of ""PA 2"" is true of this one also No one will watch it twice.

Its notable for how much it can scare us with so little.The creaks and squeaks of a house after the lights are out the sound of an icemaker in the wee hours and the quietly whirring motor of a pool filter provided an absurd sense of terror in the first two films. And the gimmick -- documentary-style found footage -- was a ridiculously clever one blending the best of The Blair Witch Project with a hint of Poltergeist.MORE Paranormal directors dont scare easilyVIDEO See the trailerParanormal Activity 3 delivers similarly eerie moments though long stretches go by where nothing truly ominous occurs. But the genius of these films is how they inspire viewers to sit warily their fear factor turned up to 11 when nothing much is happening. Yet.At the helm this time are Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost directors of the fascinating and controversial documentary Catfish about a guy who meets what appears to be his dream girl on Facebook.About the movieParanormal Activity 3   1/2 out of fourStars Lauren Bittner Christopher Nicholas Smith Katie Featherston Sprague GraydenDirectors Henry Joost Ariel Schulman Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating R for some violence language brief sexuality and drug useRunning time 1 hour 21 minutesOpens Friday nationwideThis third Paranormal is a prequel that occasionally goes off the rails but also offers more laughs and somewhat more character development than the previous installments.The cast is slightly bigger but the setting is no less claustrophobic than before a split-level suburban home that is the antithesis of the Gothic haunted house. What makes it all the more chilling is the contrast of the innocuous environment with inexplicable events.Katie (Katie Featherston) and her sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) are traumatized as children by an unseen demonic force. The plot delves into that childhood and uncovers the source of the mayhem.Joost and Schulman create an elaborate back story and mythology for the more pared-down and unsettling stories that came before. Set in 1988 this tale unspools as did its predecessors via home-movie footage. Little Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) and young Katie (Chloe Csengery) live with their mother Julie (Lauren Bittner) and her boyfriend Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith) who handily happens to be a wedding videographer. Hes the first to sense trouble afoot and installs surveillance cameras to capture the weird occurrences. Doors mysteriously slam footsteps pad along hallways and dust particles form a human figure. One of the daughters has a creepy imaginary playmate. The best jolts come courtesy of a camera rigged up to a rotating fan. But the freshness of the first film has faded somewhat as has a degree of terror. The filmmakers fall back on well-trodden and rather silly territory involving a creepy witches coven.This may be the most ambitious Paranormal and while its not the most frightening its the kind of Halloween scare-fest enhanced by a jittery audience in a packed theater.

"Paranormal Activity 3 provides fresh thrills movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Paranormal Activity 3Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman deliver an inventive and witty take on the franchise making it easily the best of the three.October 21 2011|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times A scene from ""Paranormal Activity 3."" (Paramount )""Paranormal Activity 3"" the latest installment in the low-budget horror franchise is far and away the sharpest most wildly aware film in the series. Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman known for their controversial Sundance film ""Catfish"" are working from the same essential bones as the previous two ""Paranormal"" movies a a family suspects a threatening supernatural presence has invaded their home and so they begin to videotape themselves around the clock in hopes of capturing proof. But there is a fresh active energy here largely missing from the rather lumbering maneuvers of the earlier ""found footage"" fright flicks. The ""Paranormal"" trilogy centers on two sisters who seem to be cursed by some sort of demon. The first film focused on one adult sister and the second on the other so for this third film (written by Christopher Landon also a screenwriter on ""Paranormal Activity 2"") the story goes back to the time when the siblings were children and answers some of the questions that have hovered over the series. (Namely why them?) With the majority of the action set in 1988 ""Paranormal Activity 3"" is supposedly sourced from videotape footage found relatively recently. Though the filmmakers have lots of fun with 80s aesthetics and artifacts a a Teddy Ruxpin doll is mined for queasy laughs a they dont go quite so far as to make the image look degraded like an old VHS tape as in Harmony Korines art-horror outing ""Trash Humpers."" Throughout though there is a newfound wit and invention. The blocking used to get characters (and scares) in and out of shots feels lively and fun making the jolts hit harder and the thrills giddier. Rather than the tight confinement of the previous two installments in the ""Paranormal Activity"" series a which were easier to talk about as products of a marketing phenomenon than as actual films because there frankly wasnt much to them a this one feels downright expansive with secondary characters (a co-worker friend a baby sitter the girls grandmother) and a change of location for the finale. All of this proves that Joost and Schulman are real filmmakers and not just stunt artists more convincing at making a plainly fictional film that purports to be reality than a documentary of shaky authenticity. Though some of the core problems of logic and framing of the ""Paranormal"" franchise remain a who is controlling the footage during the signature fast-forwarding sections making the edits or this time around loading that tape into a VCR? a with ""Paranormal Activity 3"" directors Joost and Schulman have conjured a hipster horror picture that should nevertheless satisfy fans still hungry for more. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESParanormal Activity 4 offers the same old scares critics...October 19 2012Paranormal Activity 4 expects to draw Latino moviegoersOctober 18 2012Review Paranormal Activity 4 an eerie setup for another...October 18 2012New on DVDJanuary 22 2012Movie review Paranormal Activity 2October 23 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentParanormal ActivityFootageCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-paranormal-activity-20111021,0,2291518.story?track=rss",200,paranormalactivity35,paranormalactivity3,latimes

One or two invigorating jolts aside thats the case with this pointless second follow-up--a pre-quel no less--to Oren Pelis slow-burning 2007 suburban ghost story. Paranormal Activity 3 backtracks to 1988 to reveal (sort of) how the hauntings that plague sisters Katie and Kristi began. As youngsters in 1988 the pair (Chloe Csengery and Jessica Ty-ler Brown) endures the attention of an unseen spectral masher along with incessant taping by their moms videographer boyfriend (Chris Smith) whos intent on getting to the bot-tom of the unexplained thumps quakes furniture rearranging and other manifestations familiar from the first two movies. Too familiar it turns out This entry apes the scares from the original film and last years far-from-great Paranormal Activity 2 so faithfully that yawns are as likely as girly shrieks. Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman cashing a quick paycheck after their critical hit Catfish try to liven things up by reintroducing the nookie and yuks that disappeared from part deux but cant overcome the dearth of fresh ideas in Christopher B. Landons screenplay. It hardly helps that they light and shoot the thing like a Paramount blockbuster instead of the surveillance footage its supposed to be. The further this series drifts into corporate-franchise territory and away from Pelis inventively cheap slyly psychosexual conception the more reasons there are to just stay away Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Mark Holcomb Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

(Paramount/Everett) Joe Neumaier Thursday October 20 2011 321 PM Title Paranormal Activity 3 With Lauren Bittner Katie Featherston. Prequel to the horror series of a possessed young woman and her family. Directors Henry Joost Ariel Schulman (124). R Language sexuality. At area theaters. A few really weird things happen during ""Paranormal Activity 3"" though unfortunately they have nothing to do with being frightened. First this latest entry in the popular ""found-footage"" horror series makes a decision early on to reduce Katie Featherston -- who was memorably pursued and then possessed by a demon in the 2009 and 2010 ""Paranormal"" editions -- to a cameo. Has Katie grown bored with being ""the evil chick"" in these homegrown creepouts? Perhaps a subsequent film will reveal the truth. For now her presence is missed. Additionally and more alarmingly with this film the ""Paranormal"" flicks succumb to self-parody though it wasnt a far fall. Still when audience members are hollering for a video-obsessed guy to ""put the camera down"" as hes running around a house perhaps its time to rethink the gimmick. Here the most photographed family on record -- sorry Kardashians -- are shown in September 1988 when the California home of grade-school age Katie (Chloe Cserngey) her sister Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) and their mom Julie (Lauren Bittner) first comes under siege from things that go bump in front of the lens. Julies new husband Daniel (Brian Boland) is the first to notice that doors slam and things clunk whenever the girls talk to their imaginary friend ""Tobey."" We never see Tobey but Kristie says hes tall -- apparently tall enough to bump into hanging lights -- and at one point some dust falls onto his shape revealing an ethereal stovepipe hat. Did the kid mean ""Abe"" as in Lincoln? Anyway Dennis sets up cameras everywhere as people tend to do in these movies with his big innovation being a rotating camera jerry-rigged to an oscillating fan so we keep moving left right and left again. When directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman use that view its as if the whole word is saying ""no."" Which maybe Joost and Schulman (""Catfish"") ought to have said too. There are only so many times bodies can be dragged out of frame and tables levitated before the biggest scare of all is the threat of tedium. Theres backstory to how Tobey is summoned to the girls house -- lets just say Grandma has some splaining to do -- but most of the scares come via idiots popping their heads into frame and saying ""Got ya Dennis"" The sense of dread that permeated the first ""Paranormal Activity"" -- with its head-spinning moment of cloven footprints appearing thanks to a pile of baking soda -- is gone. Now the payoffs are minimal; once a grossout is delivered thanks to no kidding a youngsters loose tooth. Yet the most excruciating wait is for the return of Featherston whose presence it turns out is crucial to the franchise. Her brief appearance sets off our alarm bells (she was a crib-threatening possessee last time out) and its a hoot to see her arch an eyebrow and revel in her power as the face of the ""Paranormal"" world.

"Paranormal Activity 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; paranormal-activity-3 ) Paranormal Activity 3 (United States 2011) October 20 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Paranormal Activity 3 is one of those obligatory sequels films that use an existing template and attempt to populate it with different actors and new ways of scaring audiences. There are two significant problems with this approach here the ""first person"" through-the-viewfinder perspective in addition to being employed in ridiculous situations has grown tired (this time no attempt is made to ""trick"" viewers into believing theyre seeing lost footage) and the narrative has transcended the point where its absurdities are easily ignored. The scares (if you want to call them that) are still there - one ""boo"" moment after another strung together like a breadcrumb trail through a labyrinth. So if thats all you want from a Halloween release like Paranormal Activity 3 you are the perfect audience member. The first Paranormal Activity was an expertly crafted low budget horror thriller that used the camcorder point-of-view and an escalating sense of dread to craft something more chilling than anything released since The Blair Witch Project. Paranormal Activity 2 was the inevitable result of the earlier films success and a pale shadow of its predecessor - proof if any was needed that no one expected the initial installment to open the franchise cabinet. Its hard to say whether Paranormal Activity 3 is better or worse than the first sequel. Although technically a prequel it feels more like a remake of the original. The guy with the camera wont put it down regardless of the circumstances. Hes the NRA Charlton Heston of home movies - the only way hell release his clunky 1988 VHS camera is to have it pried out of his cold dead hands. (Something we suspect might happen.) The time frame for these Paranormal Activity movies keeps regressing. Number 2 was (mostly) a prequel to Number One. This one begins with brief scenes in 2005 and 2006 (prior to anything previously shown) thereby allowing franchise stalwarts Katie Featherstone and Sprague Grayden to pick up paychecks. The majority of the story transpires in September 1988 when Katie (now played by Chloe Csengery) and Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) are little girls living with their mother Julie (Lauren Bittner) and her boyfriend Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith). Dennis has a videotape fetish and as soon as he suspects something odd is happening in the house he sets up tripods and begins recording everything. This allows us to see how the ""first haunting"" develops. One wonders whether Paranormal Activity 4 will continue the trend of rewinding time or go back to the future. This time around the co-directors are Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman who are no strangers to this style of filmmaking. Their ""breakthrough"" effort was the faux documentary Catfish. They have elected to film in 1080p color rather than in grainy black-and-white which hurts the ""reality"" aspect of the movie. There is one clever touch - a camera is set up on the oscillating base of a fan which allows it to slowly rotate through 180 degrees. Viewers can hear things happening just off-camera but have to wait a few seconds to see whats going on. Strangely this approach is underused. As effective a way as it is for generating tension Joost and Schulman never fully embrace it. Although the horror elements of Paranormal Activity 3 are getting long-in-the-tooth the filmmakers show a recognition of this by shifting the tone away from pure suspense and into the comedic fringe of the spectrum. No this isnt a full-on parody but there are some humorous moments. Some of these may be unintentional but the majority are expected to generate laughs. When Katie and Dennis friend Randy (Dustin Ingram) play an ill-advised ""game"" of ""Bloody Mary"" in the bathroom the results are laugh-aloud funny. However if the goal is to generate howls of both laughter and terror Paranormal Activity 3 falls short. Its too by-the-numbers. Perhaps the sense of dA(c)jA  vu is what appeals to viewers. They found the first one scary and this one uses the same basic mechanics. Paranormal Activity 3 might have worked better had it been decoupled from its predecessors employing the same basic setup but using different characters. The least effective aspect of this film is when it attempts to further the ""mythology"" of the series. Halloween ran afoul of this problem as the early sequels attempted to develop Michaels backstory. The more one knows about a monster the less interesting it becomes. That basic rule of horror films is often flouted. Here the more we learn about the history of the demon the less ominous the situation becomes. Where Paranormal Activity ended with a shock that provoked screams this one concludes with a fade to static to the accompaniment of audience titters. Still if viewed in a dark lonely house with plenty of booze on hand Paranormal Activity 3 might work but I doubt thats the kind of qualified recommendation the filmmakers are looking for. (A note about the trailer below Without exaggeration 50% of the material contained therein is not in the final cut of the movie. The trailer is in many ways a gross misrepresentation of the movie and seems to be taking the character of Julie in a different direction than the path she travels in the film. Very interesting to consider how the thrust of the narrative changed during the editing process.)

Share Tweet Among the many lessons the Paranormal Activity movies have taken from The Blair Witch Project--the docu-horror concept no-budget resourcefulness the use of offscreen space the escalating night-by-night scares the naturalistic performances--the most important in terms of longevity was not to make Blair Witch 2. While each new Paranormal entry adds a few new effects and inches the mythology along its a haunted-house franchise as fast-food chain No matter what pimply-faced teenager is on the clock the burgers all come out tasting the same. The pimply-faced teenagers this time around are Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman directors of the half-ingenious/half-dubious documentary Catfish and they skillfully replicate the formula that was scary twice before and scary again this time around. Theyve added a few clever flourishes too. The first two Paranormal Activity movies referenced the past when two sisters first encountered a hostile specter as children. Delving into a box full of VHS camcorder tapes the third revisits that childhood in 1988 when ""Toby"" an imaginary friend that isnt so imaginary begins tormenting the girls their mother and their stepfather in a California home. To extend the surveillance-cam concept the stepfather (Christopher Nicholas Smith) just happens to be a wedding videographer so when they start hearing disturbances in the house he has multiple cameras at the ready. Though his wife (Lauren Bittner) remains skeptical he sets up camcorders in their room and the girls room and gets back some freaky footage in the morning. Paranormal Activity 3 has one new technical wrinkle and its brilliant In addition to the cameras in the bedroom Smith mounts a third to the base of a rotating electric fan so it pans back and forth from the dining room to the kitchen and back again. Playing with action in and out of frame has been the series stock in trade--without an effects budget the audiences imagination will have to do--and Joost and Schulman exploit the rotating camera for all its worth picking up disturbances that appear and disappear with each scan. The mythology behind the series feels all the more grafted-on this time around--and it presumably extends all the way back to the Lumiere brothers--but the Paranormal Activity movies are built on fundamental horror concepts and those fundamentals still hold.

These movies require audiences to stare at minute after minute of tripod-mounted vidcam footage of ordinary rooms in the hopes that a light fixture might start swinging back and forth -- on its own But with the hefty international box-office haul from the micro-budgeted ""Paranormal Activity"" movies it would appear were going to be seeing a lot more of these found-footage fright-fests. (With so much of the films appeal based on audiences scanning an image looking for one subtle shift the ""Paranormal Activity"" series is the ""Wheres Waldo?"" of horror movies.) For those of you not keeping up the first ""PA"" followed a young couple in a non-descript San Diego house who heard strange noises and observed inexplicable phenomena involving car keys and other mysteriously-relocated household items. Katie (Katie Featherstone) claimed that shed been haunted by a threatening invisible presence since childhood so her boyfriend set up a camera in their bedroom to try to catch the boogeyman in his tracks. Moral? Dont futz around with forces you cant understand. A year later we got the second movie which was simultaneously a prequel and a sequel as we discover that the house-haunter might have been sent Katies way by her sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) in an attempt to protect Kristis infant son. Moral? The first ""Paranormal Activity"" grossed nearly 200 million worldwide. So now we get ""PA3"" which takes us back to Katie and Kristis childhood in 1988 in an entirely different nondescript house. (And seriously kudos to the art direction team -- audiences take lived-in-yet-personality-free sets like this for granted but theyre as challenging to assemble as say a cozy New York loft.) The girls live with their mom Julie (Lauren Bittner) and her boyfriend Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith); Dennis shoots wedding videos for a living so when bumpy noises and odd occurrences start popping up he sets up his cameras all over the house to try to figure out whats going on. Of course this is 1988 were talking about so ""PA3"" has fun with the analog nature of VHS cassettes and giant timecodes in clunky fonts. From a suspense standpoint one of the films smartest moves is to have Dennis mount a camera on the base of an old oscillating fan so the camera can slowly pan back and forth between the kitchen and the living room. The agonizing wait for the camera to move from side to side generates some of the films best jolts but late in the game. Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (perpetrators of that phoney-baloney ""documentary"" ""Catfish"") working from a script by Christopher Landon backload all the best scares to the films last half hour or so and while horror films should certainly strive to build tension it only works if youve managed not to bore the audience silly during the first half. Also not helping matters is the fact that ""PA3"" decides to attempt to answer the questions about where the invisible presence came from and why hes chosen this particular family to annoy. Monsters tend to be most frightening when they are mysterious and inexplicable; start loading on backstory and the whole enterprise becomes a lot less scary. The thing that goes bump in the night cant scare you as much if you know what the thing had for breakfast and who is its favorite Spice Girl. Not that any of this will matter much to the many fans of the ""PA"" movies out there -- the same production team is in place and ""PA3"" goes after the same kinds of holy-crap-the-sheet-moved shocks as the first two so it will no doubt be just as successful. (Once again the man gets something crazy on camera late in the story and the woman conveniently refuses to watch because shes had enough of his shenanigans.) If the prospect of staring at surveillance footage in the hopes of a sudden surprise didnt give you goosebumps in the first two movies ""Paranormal Activity 3"" isnt going to bring you into the fold. But its also possible that two movies later even die-hard supporters are going to find all this stuff dully familiar. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

All is serene and still down here in Tribeca; my wife Mary sleeps in the next room. I jump when CRACK goes the table that holds my TV set. It shouldnt do that; its metal not wood. I feel another sudden movement a shiver down my spine. Im dead serious; I mean serious. Was Mary walking around? Id better go into the bedroom and check. Shes not there. Now heres an early scene from PA3 set in Sep. 1988 just after Dennis (Christopher Nicolas Smith) has moved into the three-story Carlsbad house he shares with his girl friend Julie (Lauren Bittner) and her two daughters Katie (Chloe Csengery) about nine and Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) about six. One night the girls in bed upstairs Dennis suggests to Julie that he film their lovemaking and she agrees. He sets up the camera but before they get far a framed picture falls off the wall. Turns out its a minor earthquake and the couple rush out of the bedroom to get the kids. As the ignored camera cranks away a fine silt falls from the cracked ceiling adhering to the humanoid shape of -- something. (MORE The All-TIME 100 Movies) One of the salutary effects of the Paranormal series as reviewer Drew McWeeney has noted is that it killed off the Saw films. The torture-porn movies had soon exhausted the original sagas ingenuity but the first five installments produced for relative peanuts had each earned well over 100 million worldwide. It happened that Saw VI hit theaters about the same time in 2009 as Paranormal Activity and the ghost movie creamed the thumbscrew film. Saw VI pulled in a modest 68 million around the globe and managed just one more episode before expiring (for now) while PA which writer-director Oren Peli shot in a week on a 15000 budget grossed 108 million in North America and another 85 million abroad -- a ridiculous return of 13000 for every dollar originally invested. Semi-sequels ensued and PA is now the favorite haunted movie house to visit just before Halloween. Aside from the money PA was welcome for both its mood and its method. The film yanked horror out of the Saw abattoir and sent it back home where it belongs and where it is more likely to occur. Not everyone has been kidnapped by an inventive psychopath with dismemberment in mind. But most people have a bedroom and someone they love nearby and an apprehension of inexplicable shadows breezes and sounds. PA plundered the terror implicit in familiar objects surroundings and people -- in the heard but unseen the seen but unexpected. The young couple Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat (the actors using their real names) try to laugh off their worries about doors that mysteriously open or specters in the night but soon theyre scared less of what is than what might be out there or inside them. The monster you fear is worse than the monster you see. (MORE The Paranormal Phenomenon) As for the method it was ostensibly nothing new. The 463rd found-footage horror movie since The Blair Witch Project in 1999 PA had its moments of hand-held faux-jerky footage; but great swatches of it showed the action from a stationary position purportedly the resting place for a video camera that Micah had set up in his and Katies bedroom to document the eerie manifestations. Every tyro director at film school must be handed this assignment create suspense with the most meager means -- a tiny budget a few characters and please no gore. Peli pressed the economy to minimalist extremes as if he were making an old avant-garde short or a modern European angstathon. And yet it connected viscerally with the masses. The point-of-view restriction no less than the foreboding that something very wrong would soon occur turned the most casual viewer into an intense inspector of each inch of every frame; audiences scanned the shots for hints of dread like the students of the Zapruder film. Peli has only produced the more recent films leaving PA2 to director Tod Williams and cowriter Christopher B. Landon (son of the late actor Michael) and PA3 to writer Landon and the directing team of Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman. Last year those two hatched Catfish the documentary -- better yet docuwhatary? -- focusing on the Facebook flirtation of Schulmans brother Nev with some women from an Upper Peninsula Michigan family. Or to put it in Paranormal terms it was about a young girl who enters into a kinda creepy communication with an unseen friend. Maybe the movie was factual maybe quite a bit fictional but Joost and Schulman had proved they could find emotional acuity in the characters and crackling tension in real-life (or real-like) events. Theyre fine choices to extend the franchise. (MORE Catfish Row) Subsequent episodes have filled out the PA mythology; but if you missed the first two movies and dont know what the devil two sisters are capable of just as well. PA3 makes sense on its own while running some macabre variations on the characters and the visual strategy. In the new house young Kristi has found an invisible friend named Toby whom she wakes at night to converse with. When Mom has a question about Toby Kristi replies ""Why dont you ask him? Hes right here."" The little girl sometimes quarrels with her BFF whos a bit of a prankster -- short-sheeting hair-pulling furniture removal -- but she remains faithful. Visiting Grandma (Hallie Foote the daughter of playwright Horton Foote) Kristi gets dressed in a bridal veil. ""Whos the lucky guy?"" Mom asks and the girl matter-of-factly replies ""Toby."" (MORE The Top 10 Haunted House Movies) Except for a few scenes employing a hand-held camera all the action is shown from three (ostensibly VHS) machines one in Dennis and Julies bedroom one in the attic with the kids and a third -- the beauty part -- attached to the base of an oscillating fan on the ground floor panning left to the foyer and right to the kitchen. Rotating like the head of a fan at a funereally slow tennis game the camera plays tricks that kept last nights audience in an ecstasy of masochism. (""I cant watch I must watch"") In a great scene we pan to the kitchen one time as Julie gets up from the table. Pan back and to the right again the kitchen table and chairs have vanished Third times the alarm when the camera returns to the kitchen Julie screams as the table and chairs drop from the ceiling and crash around her. The filmmakers throw in a few cheesy scares mom in a monster mask a baby sitter jumping in front of a camera. But the rest is pretty freaking  cool. The old horror trope of a threatening figure under a sheet -- a killingly funny gag from John Carpenters original Halloween -- gets a neat twist here. (PA3 also channels Forbidden Planet The Shining Poltergeist and in its panning surveillance camera Francis Ford Coppolas The Conversation; you could add dozens more.) The evident absurdity in the first film of Micahs lugging a camera everywhere even when hes trying to save Katies life or running for his own is finessed here by making Dennis a videographer who shoots weddings editing the footage in the basement of the house. And the nagging question that rumbles through every haunted-house movie -- why dont they just leave? -- gets a long workout before being finally pleasingly shudderingly resolved. (Hint They do move and it gets worse.) (MORE The Top 25 Horror Movies) Last nights crowd ate it all up -- and in some of the terrifying scenes nearly threw it all up too. The PA experience is wonderfully instructive communal fun in a movie house where if youre not jolted by whats on screen then you will be by the sudden screams of your neighbors. But the films have to be even scarier when watched on video alone or with your beloved late at night in a house whose floorboards never creaked till right NOW. And dont worry youll survive the tsouris. Its morning in Tribeca now and Im still here. Say wheres Mary?

Paranormal Activity 3 Fair to good Directors Henry Joost Ariel Schulman. Cast Lauren Bittner Christopher Nicholas Smith Jessica Tyler Brown. Rating R for some violence language brief sexuality and drug use. This weeks new movie releases But man are those some good tricks. The third movie in the franchise stretches credulity a bit simply in terms of why it exists but once you get past that -- and really if you werent aware of the first two this wouldnt even be an issue -- its got plenty of genuinely scary moments to keep you on edge throughout (especially toward the end). In fact its not so much a movie as it is a cinematic cardio exam with directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman the guys who made ""Catfish"" pounding away again and again to see how much your heart can take. Interview Paranormal directors Schulman and Joost A brief framing device that includes cameos by Katie Featherston and Sprague Grayden reprising their roles as Katie and Kristi which alerts those who have seen the first two films that this is a prequel to a prequel. A pregnant Kristi has moved into a new home; Katie drops off a couple of boxes of belongings that include a lot of videotapes from their childhood that neither remembers watching. After what appears to be a break-in the tapes go missing. Too bad because if the sisters had seen them they might have avoided all the terror that took place in the other movies. And thus we go back to 1988 when the tapes where made. Katie and Kristi are little girls (Chloe Csengery and Jessica Tyler Brown respectively) living in a new place with their mother Julie (Lauren Bittner) and her boyfriend Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith). Dennis is a videographer so when things start going bump in the night (and day) as we know they must he has the cameras and recording equipment -- VCR tapes naturally -- to try to figure out whats going on. Plenty. From there the film is another exercise in set-ups and payoffs some more effective than others but all effective enough to give you a start. Kristi says its her friend Toby who everyone else assumes is imaginary. Hmm. Maybe maybe not. By the end there is more of a cause for all the mayhem revealed than in the first films which the girls evidently forgot about when they grew up. As before a big part of what makes the film so effective and so scary is seeing everything through the eye of the camera (or cameras). Almost nothing is visible on the periphery so its harder to see anything coming. In a nice touch Dennis rigs one camera onto the base of an oscillating fan so that it pans back and forth. It doesnt take long until you dread having the thing sweep back because you dont know what youll see when it does. Dread is of course the secret weapon in all the films. Watching them is sort of like riding a roller coaster. Youre excited at the prospect but once it starts you think wait -- is this really a good idea? It is. Like its predecessors the movie is more clever than good and if you feel as if youre being manipulated by the filmmakers its because you are. Thats the fun of these movies something you know going in. The point is to manipulate you in the scariest way possible and ""Paranormal Activity 3"" does a good job of that.

Not just any face mind you. A face of nightmare terror and shivery awe one that will shoot a scary volt of revelation right through us. Were never entirely sure if that face is going to arrive but the anticipation is everything. The movie sets us up for it early on with an amazing shock as a closet door is opened. Of course were also waiting because with two other Paranormal Activity films behind it Paranormal Activity 3 implicitly understands that weve been through enough tricks in these movies -- the doors that open and slam shut the thuds and booms and scratchy skitters on the soundtrack the kitchen utensils that fall with a crash the spectral shapes that you can almost make out -- to now want to see something more. Paranormal Activity 3 features variations on every one of the tricks I just mentioned and a few additional ones (they all work) but more than the first two films it tweaks our desire to put a face on evil. The movie is a prequel set in September 1988 though it doesnt exactly look like an 80s period piece. The spacious high-ceilinged Carlsbad Calif. tract home in which it takes place looks a lot like the one in the more contemporary Paranormal Activity 2 with tastefully bland furniture that might have come out of the Raymour amp; Flanigan suburban-gothic collection. This time the family consists of Dennis (Christopher Nicholas Smith whos like a skinny young Gary DellAbate) a wedding videographer who has banks of monitors and editing equipment in his home studio; his big-haired sexy wife Julie (Lauren Bittner); and her two preteen daughters from a previous marriage. They are Katie (Chloe Csengery) who will grow up to be the Katie Featherstone character in the first film and angel-faced Kristi (Jessica Tyler Brown) from Paranormal Activity 2 here an enigmatic child who can communicate with the spirit world. Its one of this haunted-house movies best jokes that the ghost on hand is Kristis invisible friend ""Toby"" whom she talks to with a mixture of intimacy and intimidated formality. As soon as the family begins to hear mysterious sounds in their new home Dennis insists on rigging up a handful of video cameras as makeshift surveillance devices. We get time-coded views of the parents and kids bedrooms -- and most cleverly theres a camera mounted on the base of a rotating fan that pans back and forth with fearful deliberation from the kitchen with its pristine white cabinets to the living room with its creepy looped lamp in the foreground. The directors Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost are the fascinatingly deadpan pranksters who made Catfish last years is-it-a-documentary-or-a-rigged-stunt? investigation into the fake identities that people can forge on the Internet. They turn out to be the perfect filmmakers to create a banal surface reality thats just warped enough to keep us on tenterhooks. The bottom line for me is this I dont scare easily at horror films (thats one of the reasons I tend to pan them) but I watched Paranormal Activity 3 in a state of high anxiety. Schulman and Joost have fun with the archetypal image of a white-sheeted costume ghost but mostly what theyre aces at is timing. They know just how to thread a handheld camera up the stairs down a hallway and into the scattered bric-a-brac of a middle-class childrens bedroom settling at just the right moment upon a talking teddy bear that plays as a joke even as a part of you momentarily thinks Is that bear possessed? They also make terrific use of characters like Denniss assistant a Napoleon Dynamite type played with an infectious spark by Dustin Ingram who ends up huddling in a darkened bathroom with young Katie for a scary game of ""Bloody Mary"" (say it three times and wait to see what happens). Theres no denying that the Paranormal Activity films adhere by now to a formula; this one almost by definition lacks the originality that made the first one so startling. But when you consider how the grimy mangle-fest Saw sequels have ruled the Halloween season in recent years its refreshing to think that the spook-show franchise that has now caught the popular imagination has replaced depravity and sadism with a 21st-century video-reality version of old-school campfire shivers. In her review of The Shining Pauline Kael asked -- derisively -- ""Who wants to see evil in daylight through a wide-angle lens?"" The answer it turns out is everybody.

TWITTER The third film in the creepy (and profitable) franchise doesnt break new ground but hews to the formula in expertly crafted fashion. Horror movie franchises are the cinematic equivalent of fast food restaurants -- the audience feels comfortable because it knows exactly what its going to get. Such is the case with the third installment of Paramounts low-budget cash cow series. Although not exactly breaking any new ground with its by now all too familiar found-footage format Paranormal Activity 3 hews to the formula in expertly crafted fashion mustering up the requisite scares and then some. With no Saw sequel to provide competition this year this should be the trick-or-treaters movie choice in October. STORY Paranormal Activity 3 5 Things to Know Newcomer directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman who have some experience with faux documentaries (Catfish) have collaborated with returning screenwriter Christopher Landon to effectively reprise the series trademark elements. But this edition--a prequel that concerns the younger versions of the adult sisters from the first two--is tighter and scarier than the previous installment. It also features ample doses of humor that both provides a pressure valve for the tension and brings a welcome self-conscious mockery to the proceedings. After a preamble featuring Katie Featherston and Sprague Grayden briefly reprising their roles as the ill-fated siblings Katie and Kristie the story goes back to 1988 when their childhood selves (Chloe Csengery Jessica Brown) are living in a well-appointed suburban California home with mom Julie (Laurie Bittner) and her boyfriend Dennis (Chris Smith). PHOTOS Iconic Horror Movies Things inevitably start to go bump in the night and since Dennis is a wedding videographer hes well equipped to blanket the house with the video cameras that will provide the sort of spooky footage that always seems to somehow wind up as feature films in our multiplexes. Among the creepier elements that the filmmakers have devised are Kristies interactions with an imaginary ill-tempered playmate named Toby and a game of ""Bloody Mary"" (hinted at in the films trailer with a scene that isnt in the feature) that goes seriously awry. But the most ingenious idea is also wonderfully simple. In addition to the stationary and hand-held cameras previously employed there is a jerry-rigged camera on a slowly swiveling oscillating fan that provides some of the scariest moments. In such sequences as one involving a babysitter who probably wont be returning to work for this family anytime soon the audience is forced to wait breathlessly as the camera pans back and forth back and forth slowly revealing the horrific goings-on. PHOTOS Top 10 Sleeper Hits Although theres an undeniably repetitive aspect to the films audiences probably wont mind very much. And certainly this series despite the fact that it thankfully doesnt need to use gimmicky 3D fairly demands to be seen on the big screen. Resembling cinematic versions of ""Wheres Waldo"" the films demand intense concentration as the audience peers at the frame trying to spot the element that doesnt belong. As usual the climax in which the family makes the mistake of retreating to the sweet grandmothers (Hallie Foote) house replaces the air of mystery with an all too explicit explication for whats been going on. But it does effectively fulfill its requirement of setting things up for the inevitable next installment. One doesnt need a Ouija board to discern that it will probably arrive sometime around next Halloween. Opens Oct. 21 (Paramount Pictures) Production Blumhouse Solana Films Room 101 Inc.

Paranormal Activity 3 proceeds to fill in those blanks taking place in a pristinely captured 1988 as yet another man convinces yet another woman to record the supernatural shenanigans taking place in their home. Its handy that Katie and Kristis mom had a relationship with a wedding videographer (ill-defined here in the not-quite-finished cut that we were shown -- father? stepfather? boyfriend?) because hes that much more prone to documenting the young girls increasingly aggressive encounters with an invisible friend named Toby. From here we as an audience fall into the usual sub-routines of watching the footage -- first from one stationary camera then two then a third slyly (if improbably) placed on the base of an oscillating fan with occasional handheld interludes -- and waiting for the Pavlovian drone that accompanies our dear demons arrival. The most remarkable quality of the Paranormal franchise above all other found-footage offerings is their repeated insistence on forcing the viewer to sit up and shut up tasked with examining every frame for the next hint of domestic disruption rather than serving up scares on a silver platter. For some a fine line separates scrutiny of the seemingly everyday from outright boredom and for most questions of logical human behavior remain amid the mayhem. This film wont convert those already frustrated with the oft-stationary bump-in-the-night routine but directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (of the questionably accurate documentary Catfish) acknowledge that fans know the formula by now and proceed to not mess with success. If anything they both pick up the pace and establish the period in small critical ways; a possessed Lite-Brite is such a playful touch its a pity that Teddy Ruxpin doesnt follow its eerie era-appropriate lead by coming to life. There isnt a room in this California home that doesnt have a set of lights dangling down from the ceiling for maximum sway while our family sleeps while a game of ""Bloody Mary"" in the bathroom brings expectedly intense results. Between cheeky fake-out moments genuine jolt cues and more sinister suggestion PA3 earns a greater share of goosebumps than its predecessor culminating in an extended ostensibly uncut sequence that echoes the franchises overall knack for impressively immediate scares and questionable judgment on behalf of the participants. (The adult actors are all suitably stubborn and the young actresses are aptly screechy. Id distinguish them by name but a full list of credits eludes me in advance of the films October 21 release date.) In terms of actually expanding the mythos screenwriter Christopher Landon basically sticks with stall tactics promising more of the same potential for ""boo"" beats while not telling us much more about Katie and Kristis family that we didnt already gather from the second film. This one leaves the door open to continue forth in the 80s or return to the present day to see what became of the now-possessed Katie who briefly arrives at the start to introduce the VHS tapes that well be watching although they wouldve likely been destroyed whether by an aforementioned fire or later villainy. I struggle to think that well be seeing a Paranormal Activity 4 assembled out of Super 8 and ultrasound footage but sillier things have happened in the name of keeping cash cows alive. Is PA3 every bit the prequel that it couldve been? Hardly but a year-long turnaround on follow-ups leaves little room for any grand feat of creativity. For better or worse this is more of the same if creepier than it was the last time around. Good luck finding a better haunted house on 2000 screens this Halloween.

Much like its predecessors ""Paranormal Activity 3"" is a slow-building stealthily creepy supernatural thriller that takes a teasingly indirect approach to generating suspense and escalating dread. The threequel is actually a prequel time-warping back to 1988 to show how siblings Katie (Katie Featherston in the first film) and Kristi (Sprague Grayden in the second) were traumatized at an early age by things that go bump in the night. Slightly slicker and more densely populated than earlier pics in the franchise the Oct. 21 Paramount release should play well with any fans who havent already tired of the found-footage gimmick. Although Featherston and Grayden make token appearances in a portentous prologue preteen newcomers assume their roles throughout the rest of ""Paranormal Activity 3."" Pic details how Dennis (Chris Smith) the girls videographer dad becomes obsessed with discovering the source of latenight noises that echo throughout their spacious suburban home -- and learning the true nature of an imaginary playmate who may not be so imaginary after all. Again like its predecessors the film pivots on the conceit that its elliptical narrative has been culled from videos shot by someone (or a couple of someones) who cannot be called upon to provide any sort of explanatory narration. (Its interesting to consider whether some future sequel will identify just whos been editing together all this spooky stuff.) Given that Dennis usually makes a living as a wedding videographer the new pic makes it seem a bit more plausible that the individual shooting the video (and in this case his eager assistant) would be so adroit at setting up surveillance cameras and so determined to keep filming long after most other folks would have fled to safer environs. Co-directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (""Catfish"") working from a script by ""Paranormal Activity 2"" co-writer Christopher B. Landon pull off some ingeniously suspenseful scenes that are all the more effective for their constrained points of view. Because the camera is either stationary or handheld the audience doesnt always see everything it anxiously wants to see and can only imagine the worst is occurring just beyond the frame. Some of the scariest moments are those captured by a camera Dennis supposedly has jerry-rigged atop the base of an oscillating fan. On more than one occasion the viewer waits breathlessly while the camera pans away from something vaguely disturbing or unsettling -- and then gets seriously rattled as the camera pans back to confirm worst expectations. Viewers who were turned off by the repeated bickering of the two leads in the first ""Paranormal Activity"" may have a similar response to scenes here in which Dennis tries to convince Julie (his wife and the girls mother) that something supernatural may be afoot and she simply refuses to listen. A few of the franchises most devoted fans also may object to the new pics attempt to explain why Katie and Kristi turned out the way they did by alluding to the influence of a witches coven a plot wrinkle that seems almost as literal-minded as those suggestions in later ""Halloween"" sequels that the masked Mike Meyers was supernaturally enhanced by modern-day Druids. Despite that however ""Paranormal Activity 3"" earns points for its low-key ability to keep viewers primed over long stretches to expect that something very bad or even worse may happen at any moment. Pic premiered in near-complete form as a midnight secret screening at Austins genre-skewing Fantastic Fest where audience response indicated that favorable word-of-mouth buzz soon may reach deafening levels.

Presented as nonfiction and credited to directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman the movie followed the experience of Ariels brother Nev a twentysomething photographer based in New York. Nev forms a relationship with a young woman online only to discover through a little web research (handily captured on camera) that the person on the other end might be a lot different from what she claims. Aided by speculation about the filmmakers claim that they made a bonafide documentary ""Catfish"" caught the interest of Hollywood bigwig Brett Ratner who shepherded the movie into wide release. On Wednesday the newly successful co-directors showed up at 2011 Austins Fantastic Fest to premiere the gig they landed in the wake of ""Catfish."" This one makes no documentary claims ""Paranormal Activity 3"" the latest addition to a series that began with Oren Pelis micro-budget ghost movie in 2008 played to a packed house in one of the festivals coveted ""secret screening"" slots. While Joost and Schulman didnt participate in a Qamp;A they showed up to introduce the movie with mini-cameras in hand (a reminder of the claim they made against ""Catfish"" doubters who wondered how they managed to record so many crucial moments in their lives). Joined by actress Katie Featherston the filmmakers told the audience that they had yet to finish the film but spent the past week slaving away at a rough cut. Regardless it looked complete enough to me; additionally the studio made no attempts to impose an embargo on journalists in attendance opening the floodgates for critical scrutiny. As a fan of the first two I was rooting for a worthy follow-up but even lowered standards wont excuse the faults here. While sometimes an unadulterated thrill to watch with an audience it gets progressively dumber as it goes along ending up as the weakest entry of the trilogy. Still it stands above any given ""Saw"" sequel for operating under the pretense of character-driven storytelling. ""Paranormal Activity 3"" begins with a brief prologue set in Carlsbad Calif. the setting of the last movie. We briefly see young adults Katie (Featherston) and Kristi (Sprague Grayden) the sisters whose mysterious past involves an invisible demonic force that destroys both of their lives in the earlier movies. At the end of ""Paranormal Activity 2"" a possessed Katie murdered Kristi and stole her infant son implying that the opening of its follow-up takes place before that climax. Eventually the movie shifts even further into the past. As usual these early scenes take place under the guise of home-movie footage with Kristis husband wandering around the house holding a camcorder. Katie comes over to her sisters posh house with a blast from the past Eighties-era VHS tapes from their recently deceased grandmothers house containing the horrific events of their childhood. They may not realize what they have but soon enough the tapes start rolling and ""Paranormal Activity 3"" flashes back to 1988 where the tale remains. This signals the first sign of problems Whos watching these tapes? If the viewers were any of the family members seen in the previous movie the events contained on them would have influenced their behavior. By not taking this logical gap into consideration ""Paranormal Activity 3"" immediately has the whiff of laziness. Nevertheless the tapes deliver a completely serviceable framing device for the remainder of the story. The events shift to Santa Rosa where Kristi and Katie (now played by two child actresses) live with their mother Julie and her boyfriend Dennis. A stay-at-home videographer Dennis grows fascinated by inexplicable events around the house -- slamming doors footsteps the usual -- and decides to install cameras to capture the events at night. The eerie curiosities pile up Dust particles reveal the outline of a human figure while Kristi appears to chat up her supposedly imaginary friend ""Toby"" in the dead of night. It becomes gradually obvious that ""Toby"" has some grim plans for the members of this doom-laden household. Those familiar with the series know that the presence of the camera only makes things worse. ""You gotta keep taping this shit man"" says Dennis goofy assistant Randy voicing the ""Paranormal Activity"" equivalent of the fate-sealing ""Ill be right back"" line established in ""Scream."" If you know the movies you can guess which characters are screwed. Adhering to the rules Joost and Schulman go through the motions reading up on demonology and eventually reaching the same conclusion of the characters in ""Paranormal Activity 2."" (Skip this paragraph if you dont want to know more.) The deal is this Grandmas participation in a cult stretching back to the 1930s found her entering into a bargain with otherworldly forces. The trade brings her wealth in exchange for the sacrifice of her first-born grandson but since Julie only had girls a new deal must take place with the next generation. Because that mythology already emerged in the first sequel ""Paranormal Activity 3"" hardly adds anything new to the situation; instead it pretends to fill a gap while basically just heaping on one calculated ""boo"" after the other. The best of these involves a camera that Dennis mounts on a rotating fan base resulting in a POV that swivels from one side of the room to the other revealing new information each time. In general though the trick only requires somebody or something to pop into the frame at an unexpected moment. One can forgive the overly familiar stunt for the sake of a few well-placed jolts but ""Paranormal Activity 3"" cant get enough of them. The cheap shocks certainly maintain the sense of a ride thats always on the cusp of another drop. After awhile it just feels like a punch in the gut. At least that basic trick works. When ""Toby"" attacks one of the girls off-camera while the other stands just below the lens watching the unseen action and shrieking away ""Paranormal Activity"" loses all of its power. The characters lack the dimensionality needed in order for audiences to care when theyre in peril. Of course its entirely possible that an edgier movie exists somewhere in the outtakes. Since the directors evaded a Qamp;A after the screening questions spilled out among various festivalgoers during a parking lot post-mortem. A publicist from Paramount wandered over to the crowd to gather reactions. One audience member noted the missed opportunity to litter the ostensible period piece with 80s references capitalizing on the gritty old-school VHS look (as Harmony Korine did with the retro-creepy ""Trash Humpers""). Actor Dominic Monaghan in town promoting his post-apocalyptic movie ""The Day"" pointed out the best gimmick that ""Paranormal Activity 3"" had to offer ""I liked the fan cam"" he said. Monaghan nailed it. The appeal of the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies even when they click revolves around a technique that doesnt really deserve to be called filmmaking in any conventional sense. Thanks to clever angles and timing each shot amounts to cinematic stunt work. By doing more with less the original ""Paranormal Activity"" boiled down the ingredients of good horror to its most primal form. Then it felt fresh; now it plays like a routine. These movies must be fun to make but its not the scare tactics that hold them together. The appearance of casual footage through which a story sneaks through sustains the illusion of watching real life. If you buy it the fright factor runs deep. That fundamental appeal has been lost in ""Paranormal Activity 3."" However the same appeal took on profound dimensions in ""Catfish"" a mystery not only in terms of its plot but in the mystique surrounding it. The movie demanded theories about whether or not the directors faked the footage. The definitive answer wouldnt matter because the ambiguity served the theme. Since Nev meets a woman through Facebook and takes her claims at face value ""Catfish"" engages with the experience of a veiled identity in social media from the inside out. By questioning the documentary value of ""Catfish"" one endures the same crisis as Nev. With ""Catfish"" Joost and Schulman presented an exciting new take on a curious genre known as the ""reality thriller."" They smartly left questions about its veracity up to their audience. No such luck here. ""Paranormal Activity 3"" the tiresome addition to a DIY phenomenon that blossomed into a full-fledged studio franchise shouldnt fool anyone. criticWIRE grade C HOW WILL IT PLAY? The fairly positive crowd reaction at Fantastic Fest suggests the ""Paranormal Activity 3"" will probably maintain solid word-of-mouth and perform well at the box office on the heels of the previous films popularity. However since its set to open in mid-October Paramount now faces the task of sustaining fan buzz. Its most likely to do solid business on opening weekend before plummeting fast.

May 12 2016 436 pm I respectfully disagree. ""Clever angles"" ""timing"" and ""cinematic stunt work"" is what makes the filmmaking process an art form and on that same note PA3 exceeded the first two in terms of artistic style and credibility. The plot delved deeper and the characters were richer. It was also scarier regardless of how cheap (or not) a jump can be which is irrelevant; audiences tolerance for the extreme (violence sex fear etc.) only increases with each passing year. If it takes more visceral jump scares to rattle the audience thats not a bad thing thats the evolution of the fans demands for the subgenre. The ending was downright eerie and reminiscent of older horror films that are legends like Rosemarys Baby. This was a precisely measured film and whats lacking here is most likely waiting in the wings for the next installment. Were in the heat of the franchise right now. Theres no sense judging this link in the chain so harshly when the puzzle pieces have yet to completely fall into place. There is one epic occurrence for example that will undoubtedly take place in a potential Paranormal Activity 4 and wouldnt have worked as well here. You have to keep things like that in mind and take into consideration that this is a well-loved genre phenomenon being mapped out by filmmakers who care about what happens next. Reply F.P. May 12 2016 436 pm ""With ""Catfish"" Joost and Schulman presented an exciting new take on a curious genre known as the ""reality thriller."" They smartly left questions about its veracity up to their audience."" Oh dear Eric. Really? If it was a scripted/fake documentary that genre has been done repeatedly and far far FAR better. And if its a documentary that doesnt care if its facts are to be believed is that above statement some ironic meta-critique about the state of journalism in general? Because if not ""Catfish"" being described as being an exciting new take on a curious genre sounds like a statement ignorant of the fact the film functions as a scandalized anachronistic portrait of a douche-y guy falling for a hot chicks picture online who then SPOILER ALERT... ...spends the rest of the movie learning that its a fake photo and then marvels in the age of The SIMS and XBox Live no less that people actually go online to be someone else leaves me wondering how many dolts are out there thinking its still 1996 when this kind of escapism/deception was a new phenomenon. Insert joke about Brett Ratners involvement in this douche parade...um here. That these two lucky hucksters have the fortune/misfortune to be associated with as specious a project as the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise and cant even do well by it AND cant even be bothered to answer the questions of its most loyal fans says it all about them and their films and yes hopefully closes the book on ""Catfish"" as it reveals the emperors new clothes in both.
