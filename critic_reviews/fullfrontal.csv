Arid arty and uninvolving this stab at back-to-basics filmmaking will flummox the directors admirers and bore the general public. Directors rep and presence of Julia Roberts will stir interest but B.O. prospects are blah. With ""Full Frontal"" its as if Steven Soderbergh has willfully decided to bring his extraordinary winning streak to an end. Arid self-consciously arty and emotionally uninvolving this stab at back-to-basics filmmaking after his rise to the top from ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Limey"" to ""Erin Brockovich"" ""Traffic"" and ""Oceans Eleven"" will flummox many of the directors admirers and bore the general public. Misleadingly provocative title directors rep and presence of Julia Roberts in the ensemble cast will stir initial interest but B.O. prospects beyond sophisticate-drawing urban situations are blah. The last time Soderbergh made this sort of off-the-rails film was in 1996 with the little-seen ""Schizopolis"" when the young directors three commercial underachievers in the wake of ""sex lies and videotape"" made it unclear where his career was headed. But while ""Schizopolis"" however ill-defined felt like a guerrilla-style anarchic goof ""Full Frontal"" constitutes a more conventionally ""experimental"" exercise involving a film-within-a-film mixed formats and web-of-life connections both made and missed. After an Oscar and three big hits in a row Soderbergh was in a position to do anything he wanted and what he chose was to shoot something fast cheap and certainly by Hollywood standards austere. Working with a script by poet-playwright Coleman Hough helmer shot under his d.p. moniker of Peter Andrews -- mostly in long takes on digital video with a Canon XL-1S -- for 18 days on natural settings with no lighting. He also mapped out his own set of dogma which stipulated that cast members must drive to the locations themselves provide their own wardrobe and makeup do without trailers and customary catering and be ready to improvise. Unfortunately the artistic intent and production methods are far more interesting than what ends up onscreen. Despite the fact the performers seem alive to the occasion the material is almost defiantly audience unfriendly the approach dramatically stifling; pic is peopled by characters trying to cope with mostly adverse change under the gaze of a pitiless lens that makes them look like little more than specimens of humanity. Soderbergh introduces his cast of principals dryly often amplified by v.o. ""interviews"" in a manner that quickly feels aggravatingly academic. Plush 35mm stock is accorded a fictional Hollywood movie called ""Rendezvous"" which comes complete with faux front credits and has famed actress Francesca (Julia Roberts) playing a journalist named Catherine conducting an interview on a New York-to-L.A. flight with TV actor Calvin (Blair Underwood) in the role of Nicholas. Set in L.A. over a 24-hour period beginning on a Friday ""Full Frontal"" shifts into unappetizing digital to pick up the remaining characters whose tenuous connections to one another come into focus only later on. High-strung executive Lee (Catherine Keener) leaves a note on the breakfast table announcing finis to her marriage to husband Carl (David Hyde Pierce) then stages elaborate games for personnel she is firing at the office. Carl who doesnt find the note in the morning proceeds to get axed from his job at Los Angeles magazine (by a boss cameoed by ""Oceans Eleven"" producer Jerry Weintraub) before getting the double whammy when he arrives back home. Meanwhile ""Nicholas"" has received what he believes is a love letter from ""Catherine"" on the plane and when they arrive in L.A. they proceed directly to the location of a film-within-the-film-within-the-film (at the now defunct ""Red"" restaurant) so ""Nicholas"" can report to work on the major action film that may rep his big break; playing themselves here are Brad Pitt as the pictures star and director David Fincher. Injected into the mix is Nicky Katt as a young actor playing Adolf Hitler in a little theater production of a new play called ""The Sound and the Fuhrer."" Despite scoring some easy laughs in essaying the artistic differences of the participants this whole strain of the film is rendered preposterous by the tenor of the play itself which depicts Hitler as something very close to a Sensitive Modern Guy albeit an egomaniacal one dealing with ""control issues."" Then theres Linda (Mary McCormack) Lees sister a masseuse in a BevHills hotel spa whos trying to meet a good man and finally film producer Gus (David Duchovny) whose 40th birthday party at the hotel Friday night marks the occasion that will bring all the characters together. Up to the climax the majority of scenes involves just two characters a device that proves only slightly less tiresome than the single-take coverage style that in this instance serves to sap energy from the proceedings rather than juicing them up. The visual quality of the digital work is so unattractive -- flared lights grainy textures bad balance and unviewable faces abound -- that after the likes of this ""Bamboozled"" ""Tadpole"" and most of the Danish Dogme films one feels like boycotting all further digitally shot theatrical features until further notice. By the time the party ends for tragic reasons Lees simply stated wish ""I just want this day to be over"" is a sentiment most viewers will readily apply to the movie itself. Soderbergh has made his career one of the most stimulating to follow among modern American directors because he is constantly shifting gears an example that many other A-listers would do well to follow. But ""Full Frontal"" doesnt feel any more personal than his bigger films; on the evidence thus far Soderbergh is most effective applying his distinctive touch and versatile talents to more mainstream material rather than shooting off in odd directions on quirky little projects. The use of different visual formats the character ""interview"" device the highly noticeable jump cuts and the deliberate audience-distancing all seem mannered and affected and no ideas are communicated that havent been expressed more cogently and expressively elsewhere. Evidently given great focus as well as considerable latitude the actors uniformly seem deeply into the exercise even if the films limitations prevent the realization of full and interesting characters. All the same Hyde Pierce creates a credible and touching portrait of a profoundly insecure man and McCormack despite having been photographed in ways that only intermittently provide a good look at her face registers some nice human moments as well. Terence Stamp fleetingly appears twice once in the plane and again at the hotel in a jokey reprise of his leading role in ""The Limey.""

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Full Frontal Modest Takeoff washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Full Frontal Modest Takeoff Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday August 2 2002 Steven Soderbergh professes to return to his roots with ""Full Frontal"" a relatively low-budget off-the-cuff comedy that represents a far more modest scale and approach than the directors recent movies. But dont let the guerrilla-film trappings fool you ""Full Frontal"" is much more lavish and labored over than it pretends to be but it also adds up to less than its admittedly entertaining parts. ""Full Frontals"" main players are Catherine Keener who plays a sadistic human resources executive named Lee; David Hyde Pierce as Lees husband a vacant insecure celebrity journalist named Carl; Mary McCormack as Linda a lonely massage therapist and Lees sister; Julia Roberts as a movie star named Francesca who is playing a journalist named Catherine in a movie Carl helped write; and Blair Underwood as an actor named Calvin whos playing an actor named Nicholas in that same movie. For a framing device Soderbergh and writer Coleman Hough have the characters at a birthday party waiting for the appearance of Gus a movie producer who has links to all of the above; this Godot-like figure is played by David Duchovny in an even more revealing turn than his final appearance on ""The Larry Sanders Show."" ""Full Frontal"" has to do with one 24-hour period in the lives of all of these characters - the artists writers posers and walking wounded who glide through Los Angeles like so many sharks and pilot fish. The most entertaining of them all is Nicky Katt who steals the movie as a pretentious young actor playing Hitler in Carls play ""The Sound and the FA1/4hrer."" Soderbergh encouraged his cast to improvise and Katt makes the most of that freedom here portraying Hitler as a modern-day narcissist (""Im taking a swim in Lake Me"" he explains to Eva Braun at one point) and quoting acting tips from Peter Ustinov and Tom Sizemore. A larky Hollywood in-joke in the tradition of ""The Player"" ""Full Frontal"" resembles even more closely Mike Figgiss ""Timecode"" a digital-video experiment in which a group of show business stars and apparatchiks cross paths and ultimately fates. Soderbergh is experimenting here too switching from lush 35mm film to grainy hand-held video from the artifice of dialogue written for the screen to the more ragged cadences of real life. Soderbergh and Hough hit the audience with a constant rapid-fire barrage of entertainment industry references from those irritating Vanity Fair cover lines (""Brad Pitt Wants to Boil Your Bunny"") to Robertss recent marriage. Throughout the filmmakers weave in a leitmotif of vampirism presumably a metaphor for the relationship between the artists who make movies and the businessmen who sell them. ""Full Frontal"" is a movie about people making movies about movies and Soderbergh edits so quickly and effortlessly between those layers of reality that a concentrically ordered universe similar to nesting Russian dolls quickly begins to feel more like a hall of mirrors. Watching ""Full Frontal"" is a vertiginous disorienting experience one that reflects its characters with grotesque funny and sometimes horrifying exaggeration. No matter how much fun it is to watch - and for hard-core movie fans it is often enormous fun - theres a certain relief when it stops and were popped back out to our banal one-track lives. Soderbergh has said that ""Full Frontal"" is a sequel of sorts to his first feature film the 1989 sleeper hit ""sex lies and videotape."" But that might be giving ""Full Frontal"" too much credit. Where Soderberghs first film was about voyeurism but achieved levels of excruciating intimacy his camera is closer to the characters here but the enterprise feels much more emotionally distant. And theres no denying that although the filmmaker still approaches his material with an appealing mixture of modesty and supreme self-assurance his vantage point has changed in 13 years. With ""sex lies and videotape"" Soderbergh seemed to be knocking on Hollywoods door to get in. Now as a full-fledged insider he seems to have made ""Full Frontal"" to catch a breath of fresh air. More power to him. This movie seems to have been conceived primarily for the benefit of the filmmaker his friends and subscribers to Entertainment Weekly and sundry Internet movie gossip sites. As for those of us who have come to admire and eagerly anticipate Soderberghs consistent dexterity taste and keen intelligence we can only hope that ""Full Frontal"" rejuvenated him enough to keep going another 13 years.

There isnt much nudity to speak of in this low-budget comedy but there is a stripped-down feeling to the proceedings that represents a return to an early filmmaking style for director Steven Soderbergh. The Oscar-winning director burst onto the scene in 1989 with sex lies and videotape an intimate tale of relationships that combined two realities by juxtaposing film and video shots. Full Frontal also is an intimate tale of relationships though it has more players than sex lies. It combines two tales creating a movie within a movie by interspersing digital videotape with film to indicate the two worlds. The film segments consist of scenes from the fictional Rendezvous starring Julia Roberts as a reporter interviewing and falling for an actor played by Blair Underwood. The grainier digital video scenes follow a day in the life of friends all with some connection to the film producer (David Duchovny) writer (David Hyde Pierce) human resources executive (Catherine Keener) and masseuse (Mary McCormack). Keeners brittle career Terminator rails about semi-comatose employees and people who drive cars that are wrong for them. Brad Pitt has some hilarious cameos. On one magazine devoted to ""Faith in Los Angeles"" he peers out from a hooded monks cloak under the headline ""Brad Pitt Takes a Vow."" The dialogue -- with its stops starts and interruptions -- has a natural improvisational feel. It also has some classic Hollywood-speak. A self-centered actor explains his actions with ""Im taking a swim in Lake Me."" Insularity is the films biggest drawback. Ensemble stories about friends sometimes become big hits but Full Frontals focus on Hollywood and Felliniesque moments makes one wonder whether it will play in Peoria -- or even Philadelphia. Maybe after the huge hits Oceans Eleven and Erin Brockovich (both also starring Roberts) Soderbergh was ready to return to his roots with a small innovative movie. Even though this 2 million film effort has enough to recommend it dont look for any great meaning here. These characters are interesting for their flaws and wounds but the movie doesnt delve deeply into the sources of their pain. See this movie for its humor and talented cast and you wont be disappointed.

Photo Bob Marshak (HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT Fun just not profound / Unusual Full Frontal shows Soderberghs true colors 1 / 1 Back to Gallery FULL FRONTAL Comedy. Starring Julia Roberts Blair Underwood Mary McCormack David Hyde Pierce and Catherine Keener. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (R. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Years from now when theyre studying Steven Soderberghs movies in colleges some enterprising thesis writer will see ""Full Frontal"" and realize This is where the director showed his truest face. Its certainly the movie that most captures what Soderbergh is about as a filmmaker. It brings together and emphasizes qualities of audacity and whimsicality weirdness and glorious confidence that are so much a part of his directorial personality. Indeed in ""Full Frontal"" Soderbergh is confident enough not to make perfect sense to tell a story thats not linear and to release a film that looks like a home movie. Thats fine. Think of the picture as 107 entertaining minutes from a very smart director who has decided to come out and play. Viewers need only a willingness to have fun and not mind when they realize the movie was never intended to be profound. ""Full Frontal"" is merely human funny and unusual-- and thats enough. The ensemble cast is headed by Julia Roberts who plays Catherine a features reporter interviewing an emerging film star (Blair Underwood) for a major magazine. She follows him to the set of his new picture which he is shooting with Brad Pitt (played by Brad Pitt). So there we have it -- a movie within a movie. But wait theres more. It turns out that Roberts is actually playing Francesca Davis a famous actress playing a reporter in a Hollywood film. So its a movie within a movie within a movie. And the layers keep coming. By my count ""Full Frontal"" is at its most onion-like five layers removed from reality. These layers in a way qualify the picture as an exploration of cinematic truth and illusion but to simply settle for that would give ""Full Frontal"" too much credit for seriousness not enough for playfulness. Soderbergh is just puttering riffing enjoying himself. He shoots the story of the reporter and the movie star in glossy 35 millimeter and he shoots the rest of the movie on murky digital video. Roberts and Underwood calibrate their performances so when theyre in the 35-millimeter film they ever-so-subtly act like theyre in a movie and when theyre on video theyre more loose and natural as though in a documentary. If Soderbergh has a point (and he doesnt need one for us to savor the phenomenon) its that its all illusion. Pull back all the layers and all thats left are layers. Nothing is underneath. Catherine Keener -- who seems about one good role away from national treasure status -- has the most demanding role swinging from absurdist comedy to wrenching emotion. She plays Lee who works as the head of human resources for a corporation thats downsizing. In a state of emotional meltdown herself she gets her kicks by mentally torturing employees asking them to stand on one foot and name as many African countries as they can in 60 seconds. Yet for all that silliness Keener and the screenplay (by Coleman Hough) are flexible enough to find depth of feeling in Lees relationship with her screenwriting husband (David Hyde Pierce) and with her sister a masseuse (Mary McCormack). Soderbergh is bound to be accused of indulging himself with this low-budget art film having made a string of hits (""Erin Brockovich"" ""Traffic""). But in 1997 when Soderbergh could barely get himself arrested he made a film very much like this -- the confusing and inventive ""Schizopolis"" starring the director himself in a triple role. Like it or not ""Full Frontal"" is exactly on the street where Soderbergh the artist has always lived. Its to his credit that success hasnt persuaded him to move. . This film contains adult language and sexual situations.

Soderbergh was 26 years old and his subsequent career has passed through moments -- Kafka Underneath and Schizopolis -- when those words have seemed either prophetic or self-fulfilling. That said who knew that the man rightly credited with pioneering a new golden age of independent film would later surface as a major Hollywood romantic churning out bold literate elegant studio movies -- Out of Sight Erin Brockovich Traffic Oceans Eleven -- of a kind that hasnt been common in mainstream American cinema since the 1930s and 40s? It would be nice to think that more boats will rise on Soderberghs tide but right now I cant think of another American director whos crossed over so handily from the idiosyncratic into the mainstream and perhaps more significantly back again. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Soderberghs career pattern is unique and so is his attitude. Where others would sit tight on their studio laurels and watch the money roll in he waltzes off on a modestly budgeted adventure in guerrilla filmmaking. With stars of course but they have to bring their own wardrobe and do their own makeup without benefit of trailers. (""If you need to be alone a lot"" Soderbergh stipulated in a rule sheet sent to the cast of his new movie ""youre pretty much screwed."") Soderbergh now commands enough clout and loyalty from his actors that for Full Frontal -- a fanciful tale of 24 hours in the lives of nine lost souls rooting around trendy L.A. for human connection -- hes been able to talk Brad Pitt and several industry wheels (David Fincher and Jerry Weintraub among them) into bit parts and Julia Roberts into a wig that looks like a mangy knockoff of Jane Fondas do in Klute. Roberts is key to the movie-within-a-movie conceit She plays Francesca an actress playing Catherine a Los Angeles magazine journalist (we wont take it personally that an empty L.A. Weekly rack makes a cameo appearance) whos writing a feature on a cocksure black actor named Nicholas whos played by Calvin whos played by Blair Underwood in a slyly ambiguous departure from his holy television demeanor. Made either out of Soderberghs fabled unease with success or his determination to continue doing what he did as a struggling unknown a decade ago -- in other words whatever he pleases -- Full Frontal is for better and worse a schizopolis all its own. Catherine and Nicholas story is shot in glossy 35mm; the rest of the cast appears in digital. The idea is to distinguish between the real and the screen-real but the mostly hand-held DV sequences (shot by Soderbergh masquerading again in the credits as Peter Andrews) look awful and they dominate the movie. Blurry and gray and stripped of the lush romanticism of Soderberghs recent films Full Frontal is hard to watch. Which is a waste of a stellar ensemble Catherine Keener for example extending her ball-buster resume as a corporate type who works off her frustrations by humiliating fired employees while also trying to leave her loving husband a nerdy journalist and screenwriter played by David Hyde Pierce and bullying her sister (Mary McCormack) a hotel masseuse and desperate Internet dater. Soderbergh has said that if he were making sex lies and videotape today it would look like Full Frontal. Part love story and part Hollywood satire his new feature like his first aspires to catch the Zeitgeist of a generation (his own again) in free fall. Not much has changed apparently though the movie is lighter of heart and freer of form than sex lies and videotape which for all its insights suffered from the portentousness of youth. Even when Soderbergh bites the hand that feeds by introducing a very funny Harvey Weinstein clone (Miramax which also released sex lies and videotape is the distributor for Full Frontal) its really more of a hickey. Full Frontal grew out of a series of scenes written from life by Coleman Hough an old friend of Soderbergh. The director added voice-overs taken from ""interviews"" conducted with the actors about their characters and gave the film its frame. Though there are scenes of great delight -- Underwood serenading Roberts with a rap piece about being black in Hollywood and some wonderful uproar provided by Nicky Katt as an actor playing Hitler in one of those godawful fringe plays that so often pass for theater in L.A. -- the movie remains fragmented elliptical and overplotted to the point of being hard to track. Still its worth hanging in for the finish a birthday party for Gus (David Duchovny) the producer of the film and the one person theyre all linked to. Then Soderbergh pulls off a delicious trick a gesture of pure tender unabashed movie love that makes up for everything. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm GROUP A MOCK DOCUMENTARY BY SEATTLE-based filmmakers Marilyn Freeman and Anne de Marcken invites you to spend 106 minutes with an all-woman therapy group whose most vocal member is an obese blue-haired amputee and cancer survivor (Nomy Lamm) with a boyfriend in gender transition. Dont roll your eyes The movie is not one of those whiny victim-wimmin-make-movies group hugs so beloved of feminist film festivals though it could be parsed that way if youre not paying close attention. Nor is it The Bob Newhart Show though that wouldnt be a bad thing and actually the movie is pretty funny now and then without in any way demeaning its subjects -- eight troubled women sweating through 21 weekly sessions under the wing of a serene but tough therapist. Only the therapist a Southern California professor and shrink is real. The rest are actors and luminaries of the Pacific Northwest girl-band and lesbian scene playing among others a Christian nurse (Tony Wilkerson) struggling to keep love alive for an amnesiac paraplegic fiance who was no picnic before he crashed his car; a homophobic middle-aged stiff with Dame Edna glasses (Vicki Hollenburg); a snickering hostile lesbian rocker with intimacy issues (Lola Rock N Rolla); and a prissy control freak with a father problem (Carrie Brownstein of the band Sleater-Kinney). This is risky territory and ripe for caricature and cliche. As youd expect from the first feature-length production of a new-media studio with the rather wince-making name of Wovie Group bristles with self-conscious method. Yet the experimentalism serves its subject rather than the other way about. Freeman and de Marcken who were inspired by their own experiences in therapy jettisoned their original script in favor of an improvisational process not unlike that of the British director Mike Leigh in which the actors spend months generating histories for their characters and meet only on the set where they improvise in much the way a successful process of therapy is improvised. For most of the movie we see the women on a screen split six ways as they react to one another (and themselves) with anger disbelief contempt detachment and as time goes on a degree of empathy. The camera pulls back to show the cameras that made the movie which may be one too many meta-gestures. Some psychobabble (""Were all trying to be who we are"") is inevitable but somehow or other the thing works largely because the acting though primarily reactive invests the movie with enough immediacy and specificity to turn the most excruciating banality into an original thought. It wont surprise anyone that by the end a fundamentalist Christian and a lesbian amputee discover they have more in common than they could have imagined. Its the way they get there that satisfies.

Not that he hasnt busted loose in all his films from ""Schizopolis"" and ""The Limey"" to ""Out of Sight"" and ""Traffic"" Whats most exhilarating about the Soderbergh oeuvre (not an altogether too fancy word for a very American artist with French new-wave sensibilities) is the artistic oxygen he pumps through rigorously structured cinematic storytelling. The fresh air invigorates his actors too - just ask Roberts about her Oscar for ""Erin Brockovich"" or Jennifer Lopez who did her best work in ""Out of Sight."" But even by Soderberghs standards of serious playfulness/playful seriousness ""Full Frontal"" is a tricky novelty item The director himself has variously described it as an ""experiment"" an ""exercise"" and a ""sketch."" Its also the most direct link to the immediacy and whats-real/whats-fake philosophical and aesthetic conundrums of ""sex lies"" a reward bought with the Hollywood equivalent of frequent-flier miles for the directors great (and profitable) output of the past four years. Working from a nicely conversational script by playwright poet and Soderbergh pal Coleman Hough Julia Roberts and Blair Underwood play respectively Francesca an actress who stars in the role of a magazine journalist in a project called ""Rendezvous"" and Calvin her costar who plays an actor playing an actor in yet another movie-within-a-movie. When theyre not on the set Francesca and Calvin cross paths with colleagues including an unhappy business executive (Catherine Keener) her ineffectual journalist husband (David Hyde Pierce) the execs massage-therapist sister (Mary McCormack) and the masseuses client (David Duchovny) a producer whose 40th-birthday party gathers everyone together at a Los Angeles hotel. The visual toggles between one-take unlit handheld digital video and the glossier film-stock look of the movies-within-the-movie are cues to shifts of artifice. But even the sharpest viewer is liable to - and invited to - lose track of lies and video ""reality"" while accepting the full-frontal fiction on the screen. This is all fun; certainly it keeps us admiring the directors talent for invention and excited by the liberated performances of so many favorite actors jazzed by Soderberghs trust in their instincts. The movie would be more rewarding however and less of a self-contained exercise in style (and performance) were it not so besotted with its own delights and tricks. If ""Oceans Eleven"" was a high-priced banquet of popular guys toasting one anothers hard-earned coolness in a pointless caper ""Full Frontal"" is the after-party.
