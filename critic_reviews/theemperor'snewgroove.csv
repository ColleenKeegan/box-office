Comments The Emperors New Groove Many animated features seem designed to sell their sound tracks but this fable doesnt often get musical as it tells the story of an assassination attempt that accidentally turns the intended victim an egocentric emperor into a llama. The villains meanness her henchmans stupidity and the emperors selfishness are all meant to represent less extreme behavior by real people and the three characters ultimately learn their lesson from a solid citizen whose behavior is exaggeratedly good--he treats the emperor far better than he deserves. Ingenious action sequences driven by surprisingly little plot lead to a climax full of the transmogrification animation was invented for. Mark Dindal directed a screenplay by David Reynolds; with the voices of David Spade Eartha Kitt John Goodman and Patrick Warburton. 79 min.

Wheres the usual brass band the tie-in merchandise the Emperors New King-Size Burger? The lack of hype is refreshing but will it help or hurt this larkish comic fable? The animation may not have the whirling computer-enhanced movement of a ""Tarzan"" the rich hues of a ""Lion King"" the intricate detail work of a ""Beauty and the Beast"" its drawn in broad bold outlines. But the unfussy tossed-off quality actually helps give this original story zippy irreverence some of Disneys plusher cartoons lack.The antihero of ""The Emperors New Groove"" is a thoroughly obnoxious teenage monarch named Kuzco a ruler so accustomed to having his every whim catered to that he has no concept of compassion. David Spade does his voice with a callow petulance that nails the brat perfectly. Unfortunately for Kuzco his ambitious witch of an adviser Yzma (Eartha Kitt) hoping to supplant him on the throne transforms the young emperor into a llama. And a homely llama at that. Cast out in the jungle where he has zero survival skills the four-legged Kuzco teams up with Pacha (John Goodman) a good-natured peasant hoping he can dupe the bumpkin into leading him home. The evil Yzma--a scene-stealing harridan in the grand if somewhat misogynistic Disney tradition--has other ideas. This vain rail-thin tropical Cruella De Vil and her musclebound manservant Kronk (Patrick Warburton) want to make sure he never makes it back alive.Directed by Mark Dindal with songs by Sting and David Hartley this is a fleet funny family entertainment that should tickle parents as well as tykes. Think of it as a palate cleanser after that overstuffed soporific Thanksgiving family blockbuster that has little else but hype going for it. D.A.

The emperor Kuzco (right) meets up with the kindly peasant Pacha in ""The Emperors New Groove. Disneys Back in the Groove / Cartoon mayhem returns in funny energetic Emperor 1 / 1 Back to Gallery THE EMPERORS NEW GROOVE Animated adventure comedy. Voices of David Spade John Goodman Eartha Kitt Patrick Warburton. Directed by Mark Dindal. (G. 80 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The inspired Disney animation army reverted to its old tricks of cartoon mayhem -- and sophisticated comedy -- to fashion the surprisingly madcap ""The Emperors New Groove."" Though an accompanying buzz hasnt quite hit yet this oddball comedy may be one of the brightest funniest pieces of entertainment of the season. With a brisk 80-minute running time the high-energy movie packs more fun onto the big screen than two-thirds of the movies out there right now. The voices are superbly cast -- one of the best matches of vocals to characters in recent animation. Featured are bulky regular-guy John Goodman the ever-slinky Eartha Kitt ""Just Shoot Mes"" David Spade a master of smarmy characters and Patrick Warburton Elaines lunk boyfriend from ""Seinfeld."" These folks clearly had a ball voicing the characters portrayed as exaggerated projections of their own images as entertainers. The story is plain nuts but it works. Spade voices Kuzco the selfish arrogant emperor of a mythical mountain land who drives everyone to distraction with his self-aggrandizing loutish ways. His treacherous aide Yzma (Kitt) a purring-then-growling Disney villainess in the Cruella De Vil tradition is jealous because she wants to be top banana herself. Yzma tries to poison Kuzco but her numbskull assistant Kronk (Warburton) botches things. Gulping the wrong concoction the vainglorious emperor is transformed into a llama. The story isnt based on fairy tale myth opera novel magazine article 70s TV show or any other handy fallback narrative. That makes it original. The evil aide wont drop her desperate scheme to bump off the llamad emperor and he runs into the wild to hide. His arrogance though is no match for nature as he quickly finds himself surrounded by leopards thinking of having something slightly different for dinner. Kuzco is befriended by a kindly peasant a gentle giant named Pacha (Goodman) in whom Disney animated-movie fans will recognize a big helping of Little John from the 1973 ""Robin Hood."" With the villainess in pursuit the antics have a ""Roadrunner"" slapstick silliness. Whats even better is the crisp verbal playfulness of the dialogue by David Reynolds the veteran comedy scribe who added inspired word gags to such films as ""A Bugs Life"" and ""Toy Story 2."" His script is based on a story by Chris Williams and director Mark Dindal. ""The Emperors New Groove"" doesnt pretend to be a milestone -- or even close -- as animated artistry. The imagery has a slightly mechanical look in the Saturday-morning cartoon style. Fortunately theres sufficient punch to keep the story on a fast roll. The emperor is so full of himself even as a llama that he ought to be throttled - - by somebody anybody. Even the compassionate Pacha can hardly stand the guy particularly since the emperor llama or not intends to destroy the peasants way of life by building a huge spa for himself on a beautiful sun-draped hilltop where Pacha lives with his family. The tension between the royal have and the humble have-not is high energy. Delicious too is the relationship between the wicked Yzma and her clueless sergeant Kronk. Her most clever designs are consistently upset by the dense dude. Some of the images of her wicked snoot may unsettle the very young. But it wont be the first time a Disney cartoon movie glimpsed the dark side of the feminine and theyve come up with a fine addition to their devil- woman groove. ""The Emperors New Groove"" brings what the Disney folks have been delivering fairly solidly in animated fare -- kid appeal plus that snappy something for adults eager to share in the fun. Grown-ups counting on using this G-rated movie as a shopping mall baby sitter will miss out by not seeing it themselves.

And - freed from the rules of the Alan Mencken Conservatory of Music - everyone has a great time. Although originally conceived as an epic drama with traditional Big Old Disney Songs only two (both written by Sting in collaboration with David Hartley) make it into this hip funny mostly nonmusical decidedly non-epic family picture which turns out to be less of a heros journey than a meeting of sitcom minds. David Spade voices the smug insufferably self-centered Kuzco yuppie-emperor of a mythical Inca-lite pre-Columbian kingdom who is inconveniently turned into a llama by his power- hungry advisor Yzma (Eartha Kitt). (Most men - except her big-muscled small-brained boy toy nailed by Seinfelds deadpan Patrick Warburton - agree Yzma is ""scary beyond all reason."") John Goodmans personality enlarges the decent peasant Pacha who is unfazed by Kuzcos llamahood. Kids will like this simple story (directed by Disney veteran Mark Dindal). But adults will appreciate the colorful embroidery including an always welcome Riverdance send-up and an Eartha Kitt parody delivered by the feline Kitt herself.

(Walt Disney Pictures) So your son just spilled icy Sprite onto your lap. And your daughters bawling because you didnt get the buttered. I know I said I didnt want the buttered she tells you. But I changed my mind and told you just before you left. And then theres the psychotic unmedicated kid behind you constantly kicking the back of your chair. But youre smiling - laughing even - because ""The Emperors New Groove"" is making it better. ""The Emperors New Groove"" originally titled ""Kingdom of the Sun"" was going to be a more traditional Disney story based on pre-Columbian legend. But the project was scrapped for this looser romp. Whatever the reasons for the change of story it has really worked. David Spade is hilarious as the voice of the emperor Kuzco the brattiest of brats that ever ruled a cartoon people. And Patrick Warburton is a scene stealer as a bungling lug named Kronk. When we first meet Kuzco hes a llama. When he was a human emperor you see he banished his royal adviser Yzma (a wonderfully dyspeptic Eartha Kitt) from the mythical mountain kingdom he rules. Or used to. Yzma takes control of the kingdom by ordering her slavish assistant Kronk to mix a potion thatll turn Kuzco into a walking talking beast of burden. But after transforming Kuzco into a llama Kronk is unable to obey Yzmas second order to kill the llama. He lets Kuzco escape from the castle. Yzma finds out about this and realizes she cant rule while Kuzco remains alive. She starts a hunt for the fugitive emperor. Meanwhile Kuzco is alone and helpless in the wilds surrounded by jaguars and other dangers. When he orders the good-hearted Pacha (John Goodman) to help him Pacha makes his own demands. Kuzco must cancel his plans to raze Pachas home for an emperors hillside retreat. Hmmm. Tough quandary for a brat who always gets his way. Spade and Warburton (who many will remember as the self-important Puddy on the ""Seinfeld"" television series) transform a pretty standard story line into a riot fest. But their humor doesnt fly over childrens heads. Kuzcos childish petulance and Kronks goofiness will get through to any kid. When Kuzco doesnt want to hear what Pachas telling him for instance he walks away saying ""I cant hear you. Lalalalala"" And Kronks attempts to do things right are wonderfully ill-fated especially when hes buffeted by conflicting advice from a ""shoulder angel"" perched on one shoulder and a corresponding devil on the other. Spade and Warburton might not have made ""The Emperors New Groove"" one of the mouse factorys all-time greatest but theyve certainly made it one of the funniest. ""The Emperors New Groove"" (G 78 minutes) - Contains nothing objectionable except maybe the consumption of squishy bug food.

Disneys new generation of animators has quietly staged a palace revolt with ""The Emperors New Groove."" The holiday release may not match the groovy business of many of the studios other kidpix but it will be remembered as the film that established a new attitude in the halls of Disneys animation unit. While the long-gestated project retains several classic aspects of the Mouse style from the 40s and 50s it discards many newer Disney trends and turns to the old competition -- namely the Chuck Jones/Warners look -- for considerable inspiration. Light taut and compact the zippy adventure is sometimes much too hip for the room and thus over the heads of younger kids who deserve their piece of the holiday movie pie. A fresh set of Disney characters however could prove enough of an enticement to tally solid mid-range numbers. Only time will tell if director Mark Dindals take on the classic fairy tale ""The Emperors New Clothes"" (which receives no mention in the credits) -- an approach strongly backed by all accounts by Disney chief Peter Schneider -sets a trend for a unit that was recently foundering with well-crafted but conservative animation. In some respects tolerance for pics humor and contempo attitude will go as far as one can take thesp David Spade who not only voices the egomaniacal title character but whose trademark smart-assed manner seems to have informed much of the comedic tone. While this may not suggest too much of a leap from other projects in the past decade in which cool lingo and other updated cultural references have been laid on top of classic tales pic boasts significant visual changes of pace as well. Pics opening scenes include brief indications of the projects original Incan theme. Spades miserable emperor-turned-llama Kuzco recalls in flashback when he ruled the roost and could kick plebeians over the palace walls for ""throwing off his groove."" As Kuzco reaches the pinnacle of his indulgent glory pic features a Sting-penned song ""Perfect World"" (belted out by Tom Jones). (Six songs by the pop star were junked when the serious-minded epic musical transformed into the current comedy.) Kuzcos prime skill is making enemies which he does with his evil conniving adviser Yzma (Eartha Kitt) and with innocent salt-of-the-earth shepherd Pacha (John Goodman). No sooner does Kuzco fire Yzma (""Were not picking up your option"" he cracks) than he informs Pacha that his hillside village will be razed for Kuzcotopia the honchos getaway resort. In a wittily staged and timed sequence Yzma and her dunderheaded assistant Kronk (Patrick Warburton) serve up dinner to Kuzco and poison his drink -- but instead of killing the king it turns him into a talking llama whom clunky Kronk allows to escape onto Pachas departing cart. A nearly 40-minute midsection builds the most amusing buddy comedy in any recent animation which entails Pacha discovering whos in the back of his cart dealing with his growing family (headed up by Wendie Malicks sober wife Chica) and helping the still-egotistical hoofed Kuzco get back home and avenge Yzmas palace coup. A central Disney character as negative as Kuzco is a notable gamble but it pays off in the friction created with upright Pacha. A few action scenes in the Andean highlands happen to mirror nearly identical moments in the new live-action ""Vertical Limit."" Comedy and danger are much more cleverly imagined and balanced here than in say last years ""Tarzan"" and without that films elaborate computerized 3-D work. When Yzma -- suggesting a crazed late-era Bette Davis -- decides to hunt down the king she thought was dead the watchword here is ""farce"" and the rhythm of the chase and showdown comes as close to Chuck Jones and Tex Avery as any Disney project in memory. An extended riff with an elusive bottle of elixir that can restore Kuzco to human form is milked for every drop giving the impression of a highly elastic almost free-form animation style.""Groove"" as a whole bears outs the wisdom of the shift from the original serious conception to this comedic one. Perhaps its most successful concept is the modeling of the characters on the thesps voicing them. The effect allows auds to picture the small spindly Spade playing the narrow-necked llama or the extra-large Goodman as big lovable Pacha. The sense of energy delivered not by effects but by characters is no better exemplified than in Kitts unabashedly diva-like performance. Warburtons Kronk offers ideal counterpoint drolly underplaying every line. The gifted Malick is the only thesp whose character is left out in the cold with nearly nothing to do. The echoes of Chuck Jones are especially felt in John Debneys frequently punchy underscore which only rarely drifts into standard sentimental notes. Pics dominant motif of sharp simplified line drawings anatomically fine but not overly precise renderings and less fussy backgrounds is welcome in an animation era when more has become less.

"Emperors New Groove The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; emperor-s-new-groove-the ) Emperors New Groove The (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Many times it is possible to make a snap determination about a movie based on its trailer. Happily in the case of The Emperors New Groove any such judgment is likely to be in error. Thats because the trailer makes the movie seem like one of the worst excuses for animated entertainment to come along in the past decade. However while The Emperors New Groove isnt going to challenge Beauty and the Beast Aladdin or The Lion King as the best of the ""new wave"" Disney animated features it represents an entertaining (if inconsequential) 75 minutes spent in a theater. Its short and sweet - two adjectives I have not been able to use much this holiday season. 2000 has seen the release of three animated Disney movies all of which are vastly different creatures. The first Fantasia 2000 was the long-awaited all-musical sequel to the classic Fantasia. It was designed for IMAX distribution (although it eventually received a normal theatrical run). The second Dinosaur mixed computer-generated creatures with live-action backgrounds creating a visually impressive film that was hamstrung by a disappointing script. Now along comes The Emperors New Groove which at first glance appears to be the least promising of the trio. After all the animation is a cut below that of most Disney features and the Christmas release date may indicate a lack of confidence. But upon closer examination things look decidedly better. The Emperors New Groove represents Disneys first feature-length animated comedy. Although many of the Magic Kingdoms recent endeavors have included comedic characters (the genie in Aladdin the dragon in Mulan etc.) The Emperors New Groove is the first motion picture to strive exclusively for comedy. Oh theres a message buried in there (caring for others = good; selfishness = bad) but it isnt brought to the fore with sappy sentimentality. Instead armed with what is arguably the most clever animated script in a long time the movie makes its point through wit and gently barbed dialogue. The deeper one gets into The Emperors New Groove the less important the below average quality of the animation becomes. (It is worth noting that ""below average"" animation for Disney is still better than the best offered by the other studios Dreamworks excepted.) Kuzco (voice of David Spade) is the emperor of all he can see - and has an ego to match his kingdom. With him everything is ""Me Me Me."" Unbeknownst to Kuzco his once-trusted advisor the wizened witch Yzma (Eartha Kitt) is planning to depose him by poisoning a drink. Instead of causing the emperors death as planned however Yzmas potion turns him into a Llama. On all fours he escapes from the clutches of Yzmas bumbling henchman Kronk (Patrick Warburton) and joins forces with a kindly peasant Pacha (John Goodman) who believes there is good in everyone - even the amazingly self-centered Kuzco. Together these two work to restore Kuzco to his human body and his throne. The screenplay offers plenty to laugh at for kids and adults. Theres slapstick self-mocking and self-referential humor and amusing one-liners. This is the first family film in a while where I havent at least briefly wished I was somewhere else than sitting in the theater. And thankfully there are no musical numbers (except one at the beginning) to break the comic momentum. Nor is there a romantic subplot and the villain is presented as bumbling and inept rather than ominous. No one not even a little kid is likely to take Yzma seriously. The vocal casting is impeccable - perhaps the best Disney has done in five or six years. David Spade brings an edge to Kuzco and he and John Goodman make an excellent team. Eartha Kitt finds the purrfect tone for Yzma - bitchy demanding and over-the-top but never frightening. The real scene-stealer however is Patrick Warburton who sounds a great deal like Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear (in fact Warburton voices Buzz in the new animated television series). Warburtons good-natured mindlessness makes Kronk the films constant comic highlight. The Emperors New Groove has gone through a major overhaul since it initially went into pre-production. Originally called Kingdom of the Sun the movie was to have been a romantic comedy musical in the ""traditional"" Disney style with the emperor as a secondary character. Along the way however the original concept was jettisoned along with the two main characters and several songs written by Sting. (The pop star remained attached to the project - the tune played over the end credits as well as a number performed by Tom Jones were written and produced by him.) Director Mark Dindal (who previously helmed Cats Dont Dance for Warner Brothers after occupying lesser behind-the-scenes roles in previous Disney animated productions) indicated that the films shift in course forced his team to employ ""out of the box"" thinking. The result while not a groundbreaking effort for Disney takes the animated division in a fresh direction by rejecting a number of expected conventions. The Emperors New Groove is good solid fun. Now all Disney has to overcome in its efforts to get families into theaters is that horrendously inept trailer...
