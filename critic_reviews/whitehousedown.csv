"Capital Ideas << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous He Is Not a Prospect  Next Napoleon Dynamite Sony Facebook Twitter Print Movies Capital Ideas White House Downs empty head and The Heats big heart by Wesley Morris on June 27 2013 White House Down is terrible. The acting? The effects? The villainy? All bad. The politics are a hot mess. The music sounds as if it flunked out of the Academy for How to Make an Action Movie Sound American. Any image lingered on by the camera for longer than three seconds any bit of dialogue delivered in bold-italics-underline is bound to recur later as a punch line like the painting of the White House inferno of 1814 which inspires the movie to take a break from all the high-tech warcraft to set a simple fire. Yes this is just like Olympus Has Fallen the other Die Hard-in-the-White House movie which opened this March and itself was like a half-dozen other movies. This new one ropes in films like the Taken series and lots of bad television shows. The bad guys in White House Down include the kind of youngish computer hacker who wears windowpane glasses and has a virtual orgasm swiveling around an office chair as a bank of computer screens spew code. He has clearly fallen out of the CSI overflow bin. And if youre old and youre white and youre male youre just a caricature of old white maleness. Youre a Gilbert Stuart painting vandalized with devil horns. Youre Dick Cheney. Youre Mr. Burns. Youre treated the way Hollywood movies always treat Arabs. The president looks like Jamie Foxx. By that I mean Jamie Foxx is playing the president one James Sawyer and hes a gentleman of poise and rectitude. The entire Middle East is contemplating signing his peace accord. But some havent forgiven him for ordering a stealth mission in Iran to look for nuclear weapons that werent there. Some havent forgiven him for looking like Jamie Foxx. It almost doesnt matter why the White House winds up invaded This is a Roland Emmerich film and Emmerich loves trashing stuff. He has trashed outer space. He has trashed the planet three or four times. He has trashed the Stone Age the American Revolution Godzilla movies and Shakespeare. This is his second demolition of the White House and I can only assume that part of the draw to another helping was the opportunity to capitalize on the evolution of special effects (Independence Day now looks like it was made with Popsicle sticks and Elmers Glue) and better access to heavy artillery. Emmerich is a liberal who gleefully avails himself of the vastness of the military industrial complex. So another reason could have been the chance to imagine what it might mean to trash the White House of a black president while the actual president is black and in doing so what it would be like to turn that president into an action hero. The setup for that action is courtesy of James Vanderbilt who ought to be ashamed of himself. Channing Tatum plays John Cale a war hero and Capitol cop stuck on the security detail for the speaker of the House (Richard Jenkins). John is up for a Secret Service job. The woman conducting his interview is an old school friend (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who concludes that based on his failed marriage and early exit from college Johns track record for seeing things through is lackluster. His 11-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) would concur. Tatum has prematurely become a version of Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas men being phased out of relevance. Channing Tatum keeps playing guys who cant get phased in. Thank god for that ominous-looking maintenance crew pretending to be doing work in the presidents screening room. They strike while John and Emily are on a White House tour. John flees his hostage scenario to find Emily only to happen upon President Sawyer being held at gunpoint. He rescues the president and a buddy comedy follows in which Foxx gets to lower Sawyers upstanding mask and do some code-switching for the audience. When he runs around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in a pair of Air Jordans its not unlike Barack Obama singing ""Lets Stay Together"" before a fund-raiser at the Apollo Theater. Its both men saying ""Dont let the address fool you. Im still down."" Foxx stays within Obamas lines. Theyre black presidents not jive ones. He bends the part without breaking it. I dont know that hes presidential (I found myself wondering whether Id have voted for him) but hes got gravitas and tastefulness. Anyway Foxx and Tatum have a few comedic moments in which the ex-soldier cant believe the commander-in-chief lacks firearms prowess. Their merry ludicrousness is interrupted by a lot of dumb ludicrousness. Occasionally it involves Jenkins Gyllenhaal and Lance Reddick as the head of the joint chiefs bickering in an underground command center. Nearly always it involves Emily. Conveniently shes a spunky know-it-all with a major in urgently uploading video and a concentration in American history and current affairs. She remains imperiled often enough to keep her father and the president from driving right off the White House lawn. (How is this the daughter Channing Tatum has? He doesnt even seem to believe it.) Every time Emily says the words ""you"" or ""tube"" I want to shoot her which makes me more heartless than the terrorists since this is the sort of movie where the baddies can bring themselves to kill just about everybody but her. But the character is here to make a point. Amid so much cowardliness and backstabbing and retirement (a sparkle cake is wheeled out for James Woods who plays Gyllenhaals boss) amid so much cynicism (much of it belonging to Emmerich who luxuriates in oblivion while whispering for peace) this annoying little white girl is here to champion her embattled black president to run out on the White House lawn and put her flag-waving prowess to life-saving use to say ""I love my big old dysfunctional government"" As I said this is a terrible movie. But at least its a timely kind of terrible. The night I saw White House Down the audience laughed at most of it the way you would at a sitcom. Well the way a studio audience would laugh at a sitcom. OK the way a recording of a studio audience would laugh at a sitcom. I actually turned around to see whether the laughter wasnt being pumped into the theater. People laughed just as hard during The Heat. There I didnt bother to turn around because I was laughing too. What movies are missing right now is the kind of performance from an established persona that pushes a star off the deep end. We havent had that since Denzel Washington last year in Flight. So the sight of say Sandra Bullock pulling herself along the floor of a hospital because her legs have gone numb is a stupid but heavenly image. Bullocks comedy has always been about humiliation (shes the antonym of Julia Roberts) and by the time shes down on her stomach in The Heat theres nowhere lower for her to go. That moment is funny because her character a haughty uptight FBI climber is giving everything she has to stop a murder and Bullock a movie star in middle age is giving even more to us. The director Paul Feig who also did Bridesmaids lets the shot go on long enough for her determination and physical desperation to turn absurd. She. Really. Wants. To. Catch. The. Bad. Guys. This is no Bridesmaids. Its an action-comedy to which Katie Dippold has given some emotional warmth but theres very little in it thats special or new. Bullocks FBI agent Sarah Ashburn has come to Boston looking to bust up a drug ring and winds up clashing with a local cop named Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy) whos got a personal connection to the case. My skepticism going in had to do with The Heat being a movie with two female characters that easily could have been played by a pair of men. But these two are like workplace sexisms toxic side effects. Ashburn is the ambitious professional who lives only for promotions. Mullins is the anti-feminine ballbuster. Nobody likes either of them. And they dont like each other until they do. This is generic genre stuff with a realish female friendship at its center Its a bra-mance. Some of it is also tired. Mullins has a family in East Boston that resents her for sending her brother (Michael Rapaport) to prison. When he gets mixed up in Ashburns investigation the scenes at the Mullins house give a lot of actors from that part of the world -- Jane Curtin Joey McIntyre Nate Corddry Bill Burr Jessica Chaffin -- a chance to take their accents for a walk. Its cheaply funny opportunism. But were not laughing at the characterization. Were laughing at the accents. Most of the movie is spitballing its laughs. Lest the emotions growing between Ashburn and Mullins put certain dudes off Dippold -- or someone -- has added a scene in which a homemade tracheostomy covers Bullock and McCarthy in blood and another in which Bullock is stabbed with a knife. That second moment does lead to the hospital floor but there had to be a better way of getting there. Despite the nonsense McCarthy and Bullock make sense in physical and temperamental opposition to each other. Im not a big fan of McCarthy tirades but here she embodies a completely realized character and not the crapshoot sketch-comedy acting that some movies allow her to get away with. McCarthys an actress who needs a foil and for now Bullock is more than good enough. I just wish these two had found each other 10 years ago.

So thank the movie gods for Roland Independence Day Emmerich one of the last Hollywood filmmakers who still knows what the people want and how to give it to them. White House Down doesnt have the slightest interest in reinventing the action genre. But if all youre after is a pair of mismatched heroes wisecracking their way through a series of explosive well-mounted set pieces look no further. Channing Tatum plays John Cale (not that one music geeks) a wannabe Secret Service agent whose job interview goes spectacularly off the rails when terrorists attack the White House and take the president (Jamie Foxx) hostage. The outcome may be pre-ordained but Emmerichs knack for a witty pop-culture reference a pulse-pounding gun battle or a sneaky political undercurrent (the film has drawn fire in the US for being leftie propaganda) hasnt deserted him. The result is one of the few genuinely satisfying Friday night flicks of 2013.

They needed someone who could run around the Whitehouse in a pair of Air Jordans. It;s tough to believe Foxx won an Oscar having watched this yet I said the same when I watched Stealth. Channing Tatum is equally terrible. This is the sort of movie you wish you could unwatch and then reinvest that time into a conversation with your local window salesman.

Good performances all round and the least hammy performance Ive ever seen from James WoodsFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 24 2013ChangezFeaturedIts one thing for an action film to be funny irreverent or pushing the limits of our credulity. Its another for it to be so beyond the pale of possibility that everything the characters do is meaningless. White House Down is one of the latter types. Oddly this film came about the same time as Olympus Has Fallen another film that shows the White House under attack. But Olympus Has Fallen had the villains executing a well thought out plot that though stretching the limits of credulity didnt completely require that we retire our mental faculties altogether. The most amazing part of White House down for me was the complete lack of concern that most of the characters seem to show at the events taking place around them. ""The Presidents being shot at on the White House Lawn"" ...""Fuck it."" seems to be how most of the characters respond. Meanwhile the process of US constitutional law is completely ignored or mangled beyond recognition the US army the Secret Service FBI and even the President seem to have absolutely no idea how to respond to any kind of crisis. If its this easy for terrorists to take over the White House one has to say the US needs a major security review. Ultimately films like White House Down need to be grounded to some degree in reality in order to remain fun. In dumbed down films of this sort one is willing to accept Channing Tatum dodging bullets like a ballerina and killing 75 mercenaries with a knife and two spoons but the idea that the Police wouldnt even be present and cordon off the scene seems a bit beyond belief. Either this is a brilliant diatribe against official incompetence or it represents the laziest kind of film-making out there. Even the action sequences are futile and unnecessary while Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry that completely ignores the respective positions and personalities of the two characters. Foxxs president seems to have been elected via Youtube and his character is badly writrten and even a bit insulting to black people in its use of racial stereotypes (Foxx gets really angry when someone tries to step on his Air Jordans e.g.). Channing Tatum character is boring in the extreme and has remarkably little to say. The supporting cast is also poorly written into the script delivering static one liners that do nothing more than act as plot devices to set up the next mindless action our heroes undertake. Hackneyed dimwitted poorly shot and choreographed the entire exercise is a picture of whats wrong with Hollywood. Even the ending while nefarious is largely expected thanks to a series of shots that make certain people look deliberately shifty. On a note the cinematography was very standard and the filters largely annoying and repetitive as theyre used to show the hero surrounded by a golden halo. Ironically if one had combined Olympus has Fallen with White House down one might have had a decent movie. Sadly neither really delivers and so instead of one decent summer blockbuster about the White House going down we have two one of which is mediocre while the other is complete bilge.

White House Down (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review White House Down (PG-13) There are no surprises in this unlikely scenario Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com6/26/2013 Editor rating 2 Oh America. You are to blame for White House Down. Director Roland Emmerich (2012 The Day After Tomorrow Independence Day) is to blame too but the existence of this silly movie falls squarely on your heads. This is what you have wrought with your desperate need for escapism and shallow reasons for flag- waving with your constant demands to be entertained by gunfire and explosions and hot guys in sweaty tank tops. I know things could be worse. Someone could have made another Pirates of the Caribbean movie or made us sit through the last 45 minutes of Man of Steel again. But this is getting old. To be fair White House Down -- not to be confused with Olympus Has Fallen only a few months old and featuring the same plot -- is not unwatchable. Its not even painful. Its not clever and it makes no sense and if the countrys secret service forces are this inept Im emigrating as soon as Im done writing this but theres passing fun to be had. Problem is youve seen this sort of fun before (and not just in Olympus Has Fallen). Its Independence Day without the aliens and a president partial to Air Jordans. At some point we could really use a more original action film that does the genre justice. The film stars Channing Tatum as John Cale (no not that John Cale) a Capitol cop with dreams of protecting the president (Jamie Foxx). As the movie opens John is on security duty for the Speaker of the House (Richard Jenkins) but hes got an interview with a Secret Service bigwig (Maggie Gyllenhaal) he hopes will vault him up the ladder. She shoots him down though and hes reduced to taking his precocious 11-year-old daughter (Joey King) on the White House tour. Naturally this happens to be the day that terrorists strike -- and strike pretty easily (dont believe me? Go try to leave an unattended cart in the middle of the Capitol rotunda and tell me how that works out for you). Explosions rock the White House. John and his daughter are separated but John gets his chance to prove his mettle when he stumbles across and rescues the president. If only White House Down had had just one surprising moment -- just one But no. The script by James Vanderbilt (The Amazing Spider-Man) seems to think its trickier than it is; you know where this runaway train is going before it jumps the tracks. James Woods shows up early on and do you really need me to tell you hes a suspicious character what with those cold shark eyes and dead mackerel stare? Do you really wonder whats going to happen to Air Force One with the vice president on board or the Delta Team forces heading to rescue the hostages in the White House? Do you really think Johns daughter is going to do as shes told? For most of the movie Foxx and Tatum sneak around the White House plotting to escape shooting bad guys and wrecking the West Wing. Their chemistry not surprisingly turns out to be the movies saving grace. Foxx is cool and surprisingly presidential (or at least adept at showing us a president wed like to support a smart physically brave guy who can easily handle an automatic weapon even though he talks a good peace game and can drop an F bomb at the appropriate moment with gravitas). As for Tatum hes a solid action hero handsome and charismatic. And yes odds are there will be shrieks from the audience when he strips down to the tank top. Theyre good together but not good enough to make White House Down anything more than your basic summer blockbuster retread.

Related Story Man of Steel The Dark Knight-ification of Superman White House Down--like pretty much every other Emmerich movie apart from the odd foray into literary conspiracy theory--is a crisply made but profoundly ridiculous exercise in Blowing Things Up. Perhaps the greatest surprise it offers is that in this summer of wall-to-wall apocalypse (Oblivion After Earth This Is the End Pacific Rim Elysium The Worlds End) the maestro of global mayhem who brought us Independence Day Godzilla The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 has chosen to tone things down with the relatively localized pandemonium of a plot to capture the president. (Well sure the specter of thermonuclear war eventually arises but still...) Channing Tatum stars as John Cale a U.S. Capitol Police officer who wants very much to join the presidents Secret Service detail. But despite his raw talent hes turned down flat for the position because he has a lack of respect for authority and he never finishes anything. These assessments sting all the more because they are administered by an agent on the presidential detail (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who is an old friend (and perhaps ex-flame) of his from college.Oh well at least Cale brought along his quasi-estranged 11-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) for a White House tour. Apart from his humiliatingly unsuccessful job interview what could possibly go wrong?So glad you asked. A conspiracy hatched by a comical array of right-wing boogeymen--the CIA-trained assassin the white supremacist the anti-Iran zealot the ""military-industrial complex""--has succeeded in blowing up the Capitol dome and seizing the White House. All that stands between the world and their perfidious schemes is as one of them grumbles ""some schmuck from one of the tours.""What follows is essentially a louder sillier version of Die Hard with John Cale standing in for John McClane (who needs those extra consonants?) his precocious daughter standing in for the latters plucky wife the White House standing in for Nakatomi Plaza and--alas--no one even much trying to stand in for Alan Rickmans deliciously wicked Hans Gruber. Like McClane before him Cale sneaks down hallways and up elevator shafts picking off bad guys one by one as the authorities (police Secret Service the Army the Air Force) wait helplessly outside occasionally checking in by sat phone. Apart from overall quality the chief differences between this film and Bruce Williss franchise-starter are that a) Cale spends much of his time in the company of the (notably game) president; and b) the villains are far less stylishly accoutered.On display once again is Emmerichs peculiar blend of pacifistic piety and wanton violence. The thugs who sneer that the president is ""one of those ac-a-demics who never served a day in his life"" may lose the battle for the White House but theres little doubt that from the start theyve already won the war for narrative tone. (Memo to Emmerich Repeated invocations of the adage that ""the pen is mightier than the sword"" are somewhat undercut when that pen is used to stab somebody.) There are moments of wit scattered throughout the proceedings--though fewer than there might have been--and Emmerich displays his customary proficiency with the action sequences. James Woods shows up as a retiring chief of presidential security who is clearly destined either to die nobly or to be revealed as a turncoat. (Dont worry The suspense is not maintained for long.) Jason Clarke who was so very good as ""Dan"" in Zero Dark Thirty is rewarded with a role as a tediously snarling baddie. And Richard Jenkins--well I look forward to forgetting he was in this movie and I trust he does too. Memo to Emmerich Repeated invocations of the adage that ""the pen is mightier than the sword"" are somewhat undercut when that pen is used to stab somebody.White House Down ends customarily with a pileup of maudlin melodrama in which Cales demonstration of his value as a dad is deemed no less important than--indeed is largely synonymous with--his ability to save the world. (Prepare yourself for the movies early references to ""flag-twirling"" and a historic pocket watch to come back in the most excruciating manner possible.) Before we get to that point though there are many automatic weapons to fire and presidential limos to crash and Blackhawks to bring down and tanks to blow up. Its only a little past the midpoint of the movie that one character announces ""That concludes the running and shooting portion of the our programming."" Take it for better or for worse but he is of course lying.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

"White House Down | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; white-house-down ) White House Down (United States 2013) June 28 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli White House Down is what its advertised to be a Roland Emmerich Film. Those familiar with the directors work wont be surprised by anything in the movie. It follows the Emmerich template a spectacle-tinged compelling setup; a dumb disappointing midsection; and a cheese-topped denouement that veers so close to self-parody that one is tempted to call it funny. White House Down is better than Godzilla and 2012 not quite as good as The Day after Tomorrow and about on par with Independence Day. This sloppy mess also pales in comparison to the better-paced taut Olympus Has Fallen which represents 2013s better White House invasion story. For a while White House Down makes a game attempt at verisimilitude. The security processes shown early in the film seem credible. The sets are well designed although I have no idea if theyre accurate replications of the inside of the First Mansion. Were given perfunctory by-the-book introductions to the main characters. Channing Tatum currently a legitimate box office draw is Cale an ex-soldier whos currently working as protection for Speaker of the House Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) and is looking for a Secret Service position. He visits the White House with his precocious 11-year old daughter Emily (Joey King). After an unpromising meeting with Secret Service Agent Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who remembers Cale from his hell-raising days he and Emily opt for a White House tour before heading home. While on the tour they encounter President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) who lets Emily record him for her YouTube channel. Shortly thereafter the White House comes under attack by terrorist Stenz (Jason Clarke) and his band of Merry Men. Turns out however its an inside job masterminded by the head of the presidents protection detail the deranged Walker (James Woods) whose motivations are somewhat murky. Time for Cale to jump into action. After all seeing Channing Tatum kick bad guy ass is what we paid 10 for. Thats pretty much what we get Channing Tatum kicking bad guy ass. And hiding in elevator shafts. And engaging in a car chase across the White House lawn. And dodging explosions. And throwing out one-liners that are so unmemorable I cant recall any of them as Im writing this. For those whore more interested in seeing Jamie Foxx kick ass theres some of that but youd be better off renting Django Unchained. For those whore in the theater for Maggie Gyllenhaal kicking ass ask for a refund. Then again Emmerichs films arent known for strong female characters. White House Down is at least a half-hour too long and that may be generous. About 60 minutes into the film the plot gets to the point where it seems theres nowhere to go except the wrap-up. Thats when Emmerich and screenwriter James Vanderbilt begin the delaying contortions necessary to keep things going for another 70-odd minutes. These include the ever-popular child in danger subplot the twist out of nowhere and the bad guy explaining his convoluted revenge scheme. There are also some editing issues. A climactic hand-too-hand fight for example gets butchered in order to reduce the brutality to PG-13 levels. Emmerich apparently wants this to be "" Die Hard in the White House"" but Olympus Has Fallen beat him to it. In fact this is closer to weak 24 right down to the dumb daughter. No cougars though. The action sequences are moderately diverting but nothing special although the car chase across the White House lawn (arguably the movies height of stupidity) has the distinction of being unique and the image of the President leaning out the car window with a rocket launcher could have been iconic in different circumstances. Im getting tired of action films that insult the intelligence of the average movie-goer. Who decided that smart scripts and big explosions are mutually exclusive? Its possible to craft a film that gets the adrenaline pumping without demanding that the cerebral cortex be disconnected beforehand. Filmmakers have become lazy. Movies like White House Down are noisy distractions - about as satisfying and empty as a mediocre fireworks display. Olympus Has Fallen is a recent example of how this sort of story can be done much better and even that wasnt without its share of flaws. Its a shame that the talent of Jamie Foxx Richard Jenkins and Maggie Gyllenhaal and the charisma of Channing Tatum have been wasted in this overlong meandering example of disaster porn.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 27 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Jun. 26 2013 613PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Roland Emmerich Starring Channing Tatum Jamie Foxx Classification PG Genre action Country USA Language English Chandeliers windows the lawn the pool the U.S. Capitol Building and a Ming vase get smashed in the short-fused White House Down a work from Roland Emmerich ( Independence Day 2012 ) that fulfills the summer-movie mandate of achieving maximum devastation with minimum emotional investment.The movie comes just three months after Antoine Fuquas grimmer and leaner but similarly plotted Olympus Has Fallen with Gerard Butler starring in a retro thriller set at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. In the U.S. White House Down has a milder teen-friendly rating than Olympus Has Fallen which means even more destruction but less conviction. . Channing Tatum stars as a sweet-natured Washington cop who saves U.S. democracy and President James Sawyer played by Jamie Foxx as an idealized Barack Obama-like Lincoln aficionado who brokers a Mideast Peace deal defies the arms lobby and rocks Jordan high-tops. Formula action films dont come much more formulaic that this. In the Die Hard tradition Tatum plays Afghanistan vet John Cale a divorced dad and lowly Capitol cop who ends up in the right place to prove his heroism to his daughter and the world. Early on Cale goes to the White House to interview for his dream job with the Secret Service. His interviewer Carol (Maggie Gyllenhaal) turns out to be an old college girlfriend who takes a dim view of Johns history of commitment issues leaving a glum John post-interview to take moody 11-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) a budding political junkie on a White House tour.Shortly after Emily goes to the washroom a massive bomb rocks the nearby Capitol Building. In the subsequent chaos father and daughter are separated as a paramilitary squad posing as home-theatre technicians take over the presidential dwelling.This time the invaders are a kind of coalition of the disaffected from neo-Nazis to superpatriots led by former black-ops agent Jason Clarke (his casting appears to be a broad wink to Kathryn Bigelows Zero Dark Thirty in which Clarke played the chief interrogator). In lieu of the usual condescending European theres a fey superhacker named Skip (Jimmi Simpson) who stands in front of banks of computers and mock conducts Beethovens Fifth Symphony while seizing control of the White Houses security system.As the terrorists begin to make their meagre ransom demands (400-million? please) it becomes apparent they have a larger crazier agenda. Outside the building the vice-president (Michael Murphy) and speaker Eli Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) ponder the future of the White House and the government.Tank-sized plot holes aside the most jarring thing about White House Down is the confusion in tone from scene to scene in the movies attempt at demographic reach. Theres a parade of military hardware airplane destruction and the threat of nuclear Armageddon for the weapons porn crowd; Tatum stripped down in a soiled muscle shirt for Magic Mike fans; a slapstick car chase on the White House grounds and an officious tour guide for those who like their comedy broad; violence against children and demonstrations of pint-sized bravery for those who melt for melodrama.The problem is when the trivial and the monumental are so interchangeable nothing actually matters.

(Would breaking loose be considered unpresidential?) Johns young daughter (Joey King) is also trapped inside the White House and she disports herself mightily. Maybe shell get her own movie franchise.Emmerich isnt strenuous about setting a consistent tone. Action movie blow-ups are interlaced with dumb jokes and slapstick. Hes an anything-for-effect guy but some of his effects are none too effective.

By Dana Stevens Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum in White House Down Photo courtesy of Reiner Bajo/Columbia Pictures Industries Inc./Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc. Should Roland Emmerich be put on some sort of government watch list? Nearly two decades after he first publicly fantasized about the destruction of Washington D.C. in Independence Day (1996) hes back with another massive imagined attack on our nations capital in White House Down--this time not via alien invasion but a humanity-driven inside job. In the Mayan-calendar disaster epic 2012 Emmerich demolished not only the seat of U.S. government but a large portion of the Earths surface. And when not compulsively re-enacting the annihilation of all that America holds dear the German-born director has been known to espouse radical-fringe ideology--namely in his last film Anonymous the belief that William Shakespeare of Stratford was not the author of the plays published under his name. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Im glad though that the NSA hasnt yet spirited Emmerich off to a remote location because I rather enjoy his movies (the more self-serious Anonymous being a rare exception). Emmerichs vision of civilizations collapse is so loony the scale of the damage he imagines so vast that his best movies (that is to say his worst) achieve a strange tone of devil-may-care merriment. In White House Down the spectacularly disturbing image of the Capitol rotunda exploding into flame--which dominates the films marketing campaign--isnt some sort of action-climax dessert; its an amuse-bouche of excitement that occurs about 15 minutes in. Things only escalate from there as the battleground quickly moves from Capitol Hill to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. (as impressively replicated in the production design of Kirk M. Petruccelli). Channing Tatum plays John Cale who (having presumably time-traveled from his days as a founding member of the Velvet Underground) is an Iraq vet serving on the security detail of the speaker of the House Congressman Eli Raphelson (Richard Jenkins). Cales dream is to move up to the Secret Service--in part because his 11-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) is a politics nerd with a crush on the sitting president. You can see why given that as played by Jamie Foxx President James Sawyer is basically Barack Obama (complete with a secret addiction to cigarettes and a not-so-secret obsession with Abraham Lincoln) after an extra spin through the sexifying machine. In addition to being handsome and charmingly self-effacing Sawyer is honest idealistic and righteous. ""The pen is mightier than the sword"" he announces in a speech on the eve of a major Middle East peace accord. Its an adage that will come in handy later when weapons around the Oval Office are in short supply. Advertisement Cales interview for the Secret Service job doesnt go so well. His interviewer Special Agent Carol Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) turns out to be an old college flame which is not only socially awkward but professionally disadvantageous--she remembers her exs bad study habits and poor impulse control and suggests he content himself with a less prestigious post. But as Cale and his daughter are about to leave the White House (in an attempt to win her reluctant tween affection hes wangled a day pass for them both) some heavy shit starts to go down. First theres the aforementioned explosion at the Capitol then a full-scale armed invasion of the White House by domestic terrorists. Cale and his little girl--not to mention the president his staff and a roomful of nervous tourists--become the hostages of a nasty crew of heavily armed malcontents including a resentful war vet (Jason Clarke) a sadistic white supremacist (Kevin Rankin) and a traitorous presidential staffer whose identity I wont disclose but whose treachery is revealed early on. Just what this ruthless bunch is after--and why its so important to them in all the surrounding mayhem to capture the president alive--wont make sense until the last few minutes (and unless youre on mescaline probably not even then). All Cale knows is that he must find and protect his daughter whos gotten separated from him in the chaos. But in his search for Emily Cale happens upon President Sawyer being held at gunpoint--and suddenly that Secret Service position he wanted is all his along with the unenviable responsibility of saving the world from all-out war. You see the bad guys have also brought along a computer hacker (Jimmi Simpson)--one of the evil kind who in an apparent nod to Die Hard enjoys blasting Beethoven symphonies as he cracks the NORAD missile launch codes one by one. Even as the story accrues preposterousness the action moves along crisply and Tatum and Foxx hit a nice buddy-movie vibe especially in the scenes where the bookish retiring president (again shades of Obama) learns to enjoy the pleasures of putting on a pair of Jordans and firing a rocket launcher out the window of a limousine. In this season of solemnly manly blockbusters I appreciated the boyish energy of White House Down a movie that for all its flamboyant destructiveness has a playful innocence at its core. In essence its 137 minutes of action figures being bashed together and even if thats about 20 minutes too long there are plenty of laughs and thrills all through--many of them at the expense of plausibility which as the films last act makes clear might be the one thing Emmerich enjoys destroying more than Air Force One.

Lucky for us that man is Channing Tatum (COLUMBIA) Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 28 2013 at 503 AM updated June 28 2013 at 504 AM comments If youre only going to see one film this year about a home invasion at the White House (and the lone hero who comes to the rescue) -- well then you probably already have. And thats too bad. Because although ""Olympus Has Fallen"" released back in March was the first out of the gate ""White House Down"" is a slightly better film and well worth two hours and a box of popcorn. Although frankly -- if youve already seen ""Olympus Has Fallen""? You may feel as if youve already seen this too. Slightly disreputable security guy and a female boss who doesnt quite trust him? Check. Lots of plot twists involving secret basement tunnels and nuclear launch codes? Got it. Plucky kid running around the White House and a traitor inside running the whole show? Yup. Its really almost the same movie. Its just a little better this time. Of course director Roland Emmerich -- who first laid waste to Washington in that equally goofy pleasure ""Independence Day"" -- has his own weaknesses chief among them ham-handed political opining. Also thinking hes funny. Hes not and his current idea of comic relief -- a high-camp computer hacker fussy tour guide and low-comedy White Power knucklehead -- isnt any better than it was back when he had the president fighting aliens (remember Judd Hirsch? Harvey Fierstein? Randy Quaid?) Unfortunately the best potential joke -- our hero is named John Cale -- goes right over Emmerichs head. (Seriously I kept hoping his backup would arrive -- and itd be Lou Reed and Nico.) But at least Emmerich understands the spectacle that movies can provide. And -- unlike say the directors of the ""Fast amp; Furious"" films -- hes also careful to keep events almost plausible and action sequences clearly edited (youre always aware of niceties like geography and space). Channing Tatum who is becoming a very canny star is smart enough to play to his perceived weaknesses too embodying a beefy character who no one thinks is very serious or very smart. And while Jamie Foxx is clearly an Obama stand-in right down to the Nicorette gum he also adds his own bit of snap and grit. There are also a number of veteran character actors including James Woods -- rocking a very old-school H.R. Haldeman buzzcut -- Michael Murphy and the always-welcome Richard Jenkins. But its the Die-Hard-in-the-White-House scenes that are the real stars -- tightly framed and quickly paced scenes of mayhem murder and hand-to-hand combat as an on-his-own Tatum tries to save the day. Of course there is that bad comic relief to get through and some of the dialogue is so corny you could pop it and pour butter on it. (And the choice of villains -- white right-wingers upset at the presidents plan to pull all our troops out of the Mideast -- isnt exactly going to convert people who already think Hollywood is a mess of clueless liberals.) To do our own quick exit poll and instant analysis? ""Olympus Has Fallen"" was first on the scene albeit with more jingoism and some queasy racial subtext. ""White House Down"" has better action sequences though it feels familiar and has too many jokes that dont come off. But if you havent already voted for one? Go for ""White House Down."" And just feel a little relieved that the blockbuster-movie campaign season doesnt have much longer to go. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. White House Down (PG-13) Columbia (137 min.) Directed by Roland Emmerich. With Channing Tatum Jamie Foxx.

AP AP AP AP AP MCT AP AP Posted 1213am on Friday Jun. 28 2013 Friday Jun. 28 2013 Friday Jun. 28 2013 PG-13 (prolonged sequences of action and violence intense gunfire and explosions strong language brief sexual image); 131 min.There isnt a landmark director Roland Emmerich hasnt wanted to destroy. Over a career that has included Independence Day The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 he has become architectures greatest enemy.His latest White House Down is no exception and the object of his ire this time is right in the title. Though unfortunately for him the minds behind Olympus Has Fallen got their panic-on-Pennsylvania Ave. film into theaters first.Thats too bad because WHD is one of Emmerichs better films having at least one intriguing element a sense of humor and some stellar effects. The problem though as with every other Emmerich movie is that the concept still overshadows the story.Channing Tatum is John Cale a war vet and Capitol cop who desperately wants to be a Secret Service agent but finds his way blocked by the woman in charge (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who tells him in his interview that he doesnt have the education or experience. But wouldnt you know it while on a White House tour with his precocious daughter (Joey King) a group of thugs storms the place killing people taking hostages and making demands.Cale ends up being the only guy around who can get President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) to safety. Talk about turning a job-interview lemon into career-making lemonade. Along the way Cale and the Prez re-enact every buddy movie theyve seen while the most incompetent terrorists ever cant seem to hit them despite clouds of gunfire.Whats most interesting about WHD is how Emmerich and screenwriter James Vanderbilt envision the president. While most presidents in movies project a generic sense of authority Sawyer most definitely channels Obama right down to the Nicorette gum. Still despite some lightly comedic banter between Tatum and Foxx (who seems to be enjoying himself) and a sense of visual energy the 131-minute WHD is hobbled by predictability and no real sense of threat. But that doesnt matter. In Emmerichs universe no one ever went broke underestimating the worlds desire to see things go boom. -- Cary Darling Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

This ripping and ridiculous yarn from disaster-movie king Roland Emmerich (he of ""Independence Day"" ""2012"" etc.) is about a right-wing coup detat staged against an African-American president who has vowed to take down the ""military-industrial complex."" No seriously And he kind of says it like its a new idea All in all the movie is something like an MSNBC remake of ""Die Hard"" mixed with ""Les Miserables"" (minus the singing) mixed with a wishful-thinking version of Barack Obama in which he personally takes out Serbians and white supremacists with an RPG. Oh and just a little bit of ""Home Alone in the White House.""Of course as played by Jamie Foxx President James Sawyer isnt exactly Obama despite the intellectual demeanor the sticks of Nicorette and the elegant fashion-plate first lady (Garcelle Beauvais who shouldve been given more to do). Sawyer is more like a black president whos actually from Chicago instead of being a prep-school kid from Honolulu. Hes a bit more White House down. (I am so sorry. I couldnt stop myself)Anyway not only has Sawyer announced a plan to sign a peace agreement with Iran and remove all United States troops from the entire Middle East he also intends to expose all the American arms manufacturers whove been double-dealing with repressive regimes all over the world. Jesus H. Christ First of all no president could or would really do those things - by the time you get elected you already understand there are some places you just dont go. But yeah that probably would provoke exactly the kind of right-wing screaming meltdowns and creepazoid paramilitary counterattack we see in the movie.Theres not a whole lot of realism to James Vanderbilts screenplay for ""White House Down"" amid the ludicrously inept security around the president the motor vehicle chases across the White House lawn the flag-waving little girl who saves America and an ingenious constitutional crisis that no ones ever thought of before involving multiple overlapping and theoretically legitimate presidents. But the essential climate of the movie - the climate of hysteria dysfunction and mendacity backed up by an enduring essentially optimistic and arguably idiotic culture of popular patriotism - that feels strikingly authentic to our historical moment.Just as Sawyer is on the phone with House Speaker Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) who lacks the nucular-orange glow of that offices current occupant a bomb in a maintenance cart takes out the upper two-thirds of the Capitol dome. Emmerich is known for destroying the landmarks of human civilization in his movies - I guess he just couldnt resist including a gag about ""Independence Day"" in the White House tour seen here - and lets say this Hes gotten really good at it. The mixture of digital and optical effects in ""White House Down"" is largely seamless and its nearly impossible to tell when hes using real Washington locations when were on set at look-alike buildings in Montreal and when the whole thing is zeroes and ones. But the Capitol bombing is really just a diversion since an entire tactical squad of scary paramilitary dudes has been smuggled into the White House disguised as technicians refurbishing the private movie theater. (Yeah there is an explanation about how these guys and all their gear get into one of the most secure buildings on earth though I wouldnt call it convincing or adequate.) You Might Also Like Fortunately for the free world theres a buff but likable screw-up on hand along with his attitude-laden preteen daughter Since this is an American action movie thats obviously more than enough to take on a team of heavily armed Special Forces renegades (led by Jason Clarke the torture expert from ""Zero Dark Thirty"") who have executed the presidents entire Secret Service detail slaughtered Marine guards and Capitol police officers by the carload and are loading Javelin surface-to-air missiles onto the roof. Actually it is enough in the sense that Channing Tatum is so cozy and comfortable as John Cale an off-duty Capitol police officer whose hardass one-time high-school classmate (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has just rejected him for a Secret Service job that he gives this outrageous fantasy a human center.Cale is strictly an archetype from the action-cinema playbook - did Vanderbilt knowingly name him after the avant-garde musician and former Velvet Underground member? - but Tatum inhabits the role with his low-key charm and physical presence in a way that feels convincing while being almost entirely devoid of specific content. I guess thats the definition of a movie star Tatums Cale is appealing and accessible mostly because we can project whatever we want onto him. Cale will be damned if hell allow a bunch of guys with nasty tattoos and ""Deliverance"" haircuts to seize or kill the president and anyway his plucky 11-year-old (Joey King) is somewhere in the corridors of the White House uploading cellphone video of the terrorists to YouTube.Emmerichs movies have long capitalized on the conflicted or confused desires of moviegoers On one hand were delighted to see the Capitol blown up and the White House destroyed; on the other we yearn for heroism a happy ending and an American renewal. Theres a lot of that double-edged quality in ""White House Down"" including the fact that the team seizing the White House includes a former NSA techno-wizard (Jimmi Simpson) who even looks a little like Edward Snowden. Both the vice president (Michael Murphy) and Jenkins House speaker (constitutionally third in line) seem suspiciously eager to get their hands on the reins of power and undo Sawyers peace deals; in their command bunker at the Pentagon Gyllenhaals Secret Service head and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs (Lance Reddick) squabble like schoolgirls. Vanderbilt and Emmerich cant come up with some surprising reason why a bunch of wackos would want to seize the White House - what youre guessing right now is probably correct - but the journey plot-wise is reasonably diverting and its a relief to see a movie that delivers action scenes where objects and human bodies appear to possess weight and you can follow whats happening. (""Man of Steel"" was a particularly egregious offender on those counts.) This piece of midsummer madness is undeniably silly and delusional a dire political fable told as tongue-in-cheek pastiche. But it delivers a lot of contradictory things we want We want to see America destroyed and we want to see it saved. We want to see priceless White House antiques get smashed and also get a little weepy about American history. Oh and we want to make fun of the media which unanimously describes the White House seizure as an al-Qaida attack. Thats a lot of good things wrapped up in a delicious package of stupid.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it As a wannabe Secret Service agent John Cale (Channing Tatum) leaps into action to protect the president in ""White House Down."" (Reiner Bajo) By Ann Hornaday June 27 2013 Follow AnnHornaday ""White House Down"" never quite seems to decide what kind of movie it wants to be although by firepower alone it qualifies as this summers most cartoonishly bombastic exercise in sensory overload (so far). A riotous display of serial explosions helicopter crashes car smash-ups sniper attacks and at least one slap on the face of a winsome little girl ""White House Down"" is the kind of celebration of rampant mayhem in which everyone seems to have a rocket launcher -- or at least a live hand grenade -- at the ready just in case they need to dispatch a scrum of exceptionally vile and cruel villains. But ""White House Down"" also clearly wants to be a lighthearted comedy. At least that seems to be the aim in a film that in the midst of sadistic violence throws in jokes and bits of buddy humor as blithely as its protagonists toss those grenades. If cognitive dissonance ensues for an audience unsure whether to laugh or wince thats nothing compared to the level of sheer volume -- and preposterousness -- the film inevitably reaches for with its we-can-top-that finale. Between all the stuff that goes boom stars Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum manage to develop genuine comic chemistry as two men thrown into an apocalyptic cataclysm when the U.S. government suffers a viciously violent coup. As U.S. President James Sawyer Foxx plays a more bespectacled less formal version of President Obama his Nicorette gum and basketball shoes chiming unsubtly with Sawyers real-life counterpart. When disaster strikes first at the U.S. Capitol and shortly thereafter at the White House an aspiring Secret Service agent named John Cale (Tatum) happens to be taking a tour of the latter with his daughter; soon the men are playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse outmaneuvering their shadowy opponents and outgunning inevitable comparisons to ""Olympus Has Fallen."" That film of course starred Aaron Eckhart and Gerard Butler in an eerily similar story that although often just as outlandish looks in retrospect like a quiet sophisticated little thriller. ""White House Down"" written by James Vanderbilt and directed by Roland Emmerich (who having also made ""Independence Day"" and ""2012"" clearly has a fetish for destroying 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.) takes perverse glee in putting its human and architectural characters through an increasingly barbaric series of physical punishments from that shocking blow suffered by a cute tear-stained child to the Green Room literally going up in flames. (All the while disas-tourists swarm the South Lawn as if they were clamoring to get into the Easter Egg Roll.) With effects extravaganzas like ""Iron Man 3"" ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" and ""Man of Steel"" already in theaters the carnage of ""White House Down"" takes on the air of something disposable and utterly meaningless. By the time Sawyer shoulders a rocket-propelled grenade in the limo the viewers reaction is less likely to be surprise than glazed benumbed indifference. 1 of 23 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x White House Down premiere View Photos Caption June 25 2013  Jamie Foxx greets fans as he arrives for the New York premiere of his new action film ""White House Down."" Lucas Jackson/Reuters Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. That stunt occurs in one of the sequences of antic humor -- in this case a Keystone Kops car chase -- which despite the tonal strangeness alongside the wanton destruction prove that Foxx and Tatum are able heirs to the ""Lethal Weapon"" brand of brothers-in-arms banter. Their shtick is the best stuff in ""White House Down"" which could have used more of that kind of leavening. With Hollywood mired in an escalating arms race of brute force and noisy spectacle well-timed humor can be a potent secret weapon. 1/2 PG-13. At area theaters. Contains prolonged sequences of action and violence including intense gunfire and explosions some profanity and a brief sexual image. 129 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

REINER BAJO COLUMBIA PICTURES BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Jamie Foxx left and Channing Tatum star in ""White House Down.""   REINER BAJO COLUMBIA PICTURES White House DownStarring Jamie Foxx Channing Tatum Maggie Gyllenhaal James Woods Jason Clarke Behind the scenes Directed by Roland Emmerich Rating PG-13 for prolonged sequences of action and violence including intense gunfire and explosions some language and a brief sexual image Running time 2 hours 11 minutes Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitJamie Foxx plays an African-American president as a daffy lightweight while Channing Tatum and Joey King play father-and-daughter heroes in this ludicrous thriller about a terrorist takeover of the White House. Grade D The new film from the director of ""Independence Day"" (1995) Roland Emmerichs ""White House Down"" is a stupefying current-events fantasy about a reactionary terrorist takeover of the White House. Its a blatant attempt for the director to revive his box office fortunes by blowing up parts of the White House Complex as gaudily as he did 18 years ago. Emmerichs last film ""Anonymous"" was an opaque historical fantasy about the disputed authorship of Shakespeares plays. Everyone who participated in ""White House Down"" should have wished to remain anonymous including each member of the wildly overqualified cast. It mixes camp and carnage but its not outrageous - its limp and awful. Channing Tatum plays a Capitol policeman named John Cale who wants to go from guarding the Speaker of the House to serving on the presidents security detail. He takes his tween daughter Emily (Joey King) to his job interview because she idolizes President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) the way she used to worship her war-hero dad. Cale got a Silver Star in Afghanistan and on the home front a divorce. Its as if Emmerich has gone from the Bard to Rube Goldberg. Since the ideal audience for ""White House Down"" would be a theater full of Emilys - a herd of impressionable 12-year-olds - maybe I should explain what I mean by ""Rube Goldberg."" Goldberg was a cartoonist who satirized modern machinery. He designed ridiculously complicated devices to perform simple tasks and illustrated them in single cartoon panels with lists of instructions. To operate a Rube Goldberg ""picture-snapping machine"" for example ""As you sit on pneumatic cushion (A) you force air through a tube (B) which starts ice boat (C) causing lighted cigar butt (D) to explode balloon (E). Dictator (F) hearing loud report thinks hes been shot and falls over backward on bulb (G) snapping picture."" Theres no ice boat but otherwise James Vanderbilts screenplay for ""White House Down"" is a lot like that except you have to substitute ""president"" for ""dictator"" and only parts of it are intentionally humorous. It contains a lot of billowing hot air and explosions and its so infernally plot-driven that each dab of personality as well as every incident and prop functions to generate a spurious energy. At heart - if you can say a machine like ""White House Down"" has a heart - its a dad-and-daughter reunion choreographed by pyrotechnical engineers. Cales college girlfriend Carol Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) now a top Secret Service officer turns down Cales application. Mostly because he dropped out after six months at George Washington University she says he never follows through on anything despite three tours of duty and a degree from another school. Cale avoids breaking the news to Emily by taking her on the White House Tour. Shortly thereafter while Emily takes a bathroom break the Capitol Dome explodes and the White House goes into lockdown. Cale kicks butt with his heavy fists and heavier weaponry and Emily takes names with her smart-phone. Cale and the President team up to outwit a bunch of extremist thugs and perform equal acts of solo heroism. Sawyer has a daughter too. All these manufactured ""personal touches"" lead to some ludicrous moments. With the Free World just a few keystrokes away from total collapse Finnerty has the presence of mind to tell Cale that she realizes she was wrong - he can follow through on something. What sets off all this turbulence is Sawyers brave new international peace plan - demilitarizing the American presence in the Middle East and transferring the saved money to economic development programs. ""White House Down"" is even more of a wish-fulfillment version of the Obama administration than ""The West Wing"" was of the Clinton administration. The closest ties to the real Obama are the Nicorette gum he keeps in a drawer and the basketball shoes he takes from his closet. When Sawyer orders the presidential chopper to ""do the thing"" - fly the scenic route over Washingons monuments back to the White House - you expect the light to flash a shooting star off his smile the way it does off the pearly whites in toothpaste or breath-mint commercials. The movie is opportunistically patriotic It wears flags on its lapel its shirt pocket and its sleeves and it comes out the weekend before July 4th. Foxx seems to know how silly it is because he plays it like a goof. ""Get your hands off my Jordans"" is his characters biggest laugh line. His most crowd-pleasing moment comes from his uh-oh expression when he drops a critical weapon and Cale exasperated asks him how he could have lost a rocket launcher. The maudlin subplots the pseudo character-building the retro or high-tech gadgets and even the historical props and paintings fuel a narrative that simply wants to create a political destruction derby complete with presidential vehicles racing on the Executive Mansions lawns. John Cales failure to watch Emily twirl a flag at a talent contest; the Secret Service chief (James Woods) gazing at the portrait of his dead Marine son and removing his own flag-pin; the Speaker of the House (Richard Jenkins) being old-fashioned enough to use a pager - each overworked bit is there to feed the action beast. Emmerichs heavy hand sweeps away any potential excitement and suspense. From the opening moments his ominous underscoring and portentous camera movements seem to put all the bad guys into wanted posters. He doesnt have the flamboyance to pull off the whimsical concept of a lollipop-sucking super-hacker (Jimmi Simpson) dialing Beethovens Fifth up to 11 before commandeering the top-security computer system in America. This movie is equally inept at melodrama farce and soap opera. You used to be able to put a filmmaker down by saying that he directs like a traffic cop. Whats wrong with ""White House Down is that Emmerich directs it like a terrible traffic cop.

"White House Down a dumbed-down invasion review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWhite House Down a dumbed-down invasion reviewYou may be tired of White House takeover movies but Roland Emmerich sure as shooting isnt. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. June 27 2013White House DownStarring Channing Tatum Jamie Foxx James Wood Jason Clarke Maggie Gyllenhaal and Richard Jenkins. Directed by Roland Emmerich. 137 minutes. Opens June 28 at major theatres. PGThe word ""excess"" obviously doesnt appear in any dictionary owned by Roland Emmerich. Theres no such thing as too much of anything to this most bellicose of filmmakers. You may be tired of White House takeover movies but Emmerich sure as shooting isnt. Having memorably trashed the place with Independence Day 19 years ago the German disaster master wasnt going to sit back and allow such copycats as Olympus Has Fallen G.I. Joe Retaliation and Iron Man 3 to mess with Americas top residence and/or its presidential occupant.Article Continued BelowSo White House Down has exactly what youd expect from the man and from the genre only louder and dumber. Channing Tatum left and Jamie Foxx make a likeable team in the dumb-as-nails White House Down. (Reiner Bajo / Columbia Pictures)  If only he knew what to do with it all.Other such films have various combinations of accidental heroes determined villains endangered kids global nuclear threats stock market panic airborne and ground assaults impromptu urban renewal constitutional crises and exceedingly high renovation and landscaping bills. White House Down has all these things going on some of them in multiples. Other movies discuss presidential succession in times of national emergency. This one turns it into a game of musical chairs. Hey we lost contact with the president for five minutes Time to appoint a new oneOther films have car chases. White House Down has a car chase on the White House lawn with the president inside an armoured limo brandishing a rocket launcher trying to escape pursuing bad guys by blowing a hole in the surrounding iron fence. The only thing missing from this scene is a Dukes of Hazzard soundtrack.What White House Down lacks is any sense of what kind of movie it is. Emmerich cant seem to decide whether hes making a cautionary thriller about libertys need for eternal vigilance or a blows-up-good buddy comedy featuring a bad-luck cop (Channing Tatum) and a badass prez (Jamie Foxx). Emmerich does have good casting ideas. Its a smart move putting Tatum into the Die Hard mode of put-upon cop John Cale who seeks to redeem himself while also saving his kid his president his country and his planet in exactly that order. Tatum has broad appeal hes smart enough to know how to sell popcorn and he looks great in a singlet stolen from Bruce Willis.Foxx who credibly does both serious and smartass makes an interesting choice as President James Sawyer a Lincoln-obsessed commander-in-chief who can broker bold Middle East peace deals while also learning how to use a rocket launcher on the fly. He and Tatum make for an amusing duo although the trailer promises more buddy antics than we actually get.There are also good things to be said about Zero Dark Thirtys Jason Clarke as the most ruthless of the homegrown House-invading terrorists Richard Jenkins as the speaker of the House of Representatives and James Woods and Maggie Gyllenhaal as the presidents top security advisors. Another casting plus is young Joey King as Cales precocious daughter (she played China Girl in Oz the Great and Powerful).The talent is all there and so is the CGI. If you didnt get your fill of anarchy in and around Washington D.C. from previous national nailbiter movies this one is here to the plug the gaps -- and also to bag more bodies than all those other movies combined.What isnt there in White House Down is a single functioning brain cell. The action frequently grinds to a halt as everybody reloads and tries to remember what to do next while also keeping a straight face. The scariest thing about the movie is how easy it is to outfox the U.S. government the Secret Service and the countrys entire armed arsenal. Its difficult to believe that screenwriter James Vanderbilt also wrote Zodiac a very smart and layered film. The actions and reactions of all concerned in White House Down are invariably so stupid Im almost inclined to agree with the bubbling blogosphere theory that the whole movie is meant as parody. Emmerich loves to kid (side gags abound) but parody isnt his game. He really does enjoy blowing up stuff on a global scale as anyone who witnessed his earlier blockbusters Independence Day The Day After Tomorrow 2012 and the absolutely wretched Godzilla can attest. Its just that sometimes hes dumber than others and this is one of the really dumb times. Hes also weirdly behind the curve of White House invasion movies which now just seems so the day after yesterday.Why not the Kremlin or the Vatican instead for a change of pace? I should whisper this idea lest I give Emmerich any encouragement for a sequel.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

A Capitol policeman (Channing Tatum) springs into action to save his child and protect the president (Jamie Foxx) from a heavily armed group of paramilitary invaders. (Photo/Video Columbia Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com June 27 2013 532 p.m. ET Never mind that ""White House Down"" tells essentially the same story told three months ago in ""Olympus Has Fallen""--terrorists invading the White House taking the president hostage and trashing the premises--or that the filmmaker Roland Emmerich totaled the very same building in ""Independence Day."" (His latest opus acknowledges the repetition with a wink and a nod.) Mr. Emmerich who has often conjured with cosmic themes sometimes wittily achieves something new this time around--a level of indifference to the genre and its fans that amounts to a cosmic shrug. What does it matter if the absurdity is slovenly the whimsy leaden the extravagance squalid? Moviegoers sensibilities or so he seems to have concluded are already deadened by a dying genre; stage this dopey stuff as a comedy of chaos and the audience will buy it. If theres one thing more dismaying than his approach its the possibility that hes right. ENLARGE Channing Tatum Columbia Pictures Before trashing the cinematic premises I should give the production its due. This wont take long because the only due worth giving is the presence of Channing Tatum. He plays Cale an earnest overachieving D.C. cop who saves President Sawyer-- Jamie Foxx wielding heavy weapons with more energy than conviction--and foils the terrorists. In the ""Olympus"" iteration the bad guys were North Koreans. This time theyre white supremacists and biker dudes in the service of a government turncoat all of them aided by a computer genius who seems to have been plugged into the script like a thumb drive. (The all-thumbs writer of credit is James Vanderbilt.) The movie may or may not have validated Mr. Tatum as an action hero--he should still study Tom Cruises action films for lessons in stylized running--but it certainly displays his energy bemuscled build and easy charm. Thats in spite of spates of inane dialogue (""I know youre into peace"" Cale tells the president whos holding a bazooka launcher on his lap while the presidential limo evades bad guys in a sort of Mack Sennett chase on the White House lawn ""but stick that thing out the window."") And its in spite of the preteen daughter Mr. Tatums character is saddled with a precocious twirpette and compulsive blogger whose knowledge of the White House helps save the day her dad and the Republic. One of the many depressing questions raised by ""White House Down"" is why so many Hollywood movies these days seem to be cut from the same tattered cloth even if they arent like this one near-duplicates of recent releases. Part of the answer is production costs. Big-budget features have become so expensive that studio executives take reflexive refuge in the large-scale familiar which in this category includes terrorist conspiracies weapons of mass destruction global threats squadrons of choppers streams of black SUVs and swarms of black-clad men hollering ""Go Go Go"" In that sense ""White House Down"" is solidly within its genre. In a deeper sense though it bespeaks a fatigue thats hard to distinguish from brain death. Watch a clip from the film ""The Heat."" Uptight FBI special agent Sarah Ashburn (Sandra Bullock) is paired with testy Boston cop Shannon Mullins (Melissa McCarthy) in order to take down a ruthless drug lord. (Photo/Video Fox) The Heat Before considering this numbing spectacle lets stipulate that Melissa McCarthy is an unusually gifted comedian. Shes unusual not only because shes fat--lots of todays Americans are fatter without being funny--but because of the cheerfully irreverent zestfully vulgar take-no-prisoners spirit she revealed so delightfully as the crazed Megan in ""Bridesmaids."" That spirit was subsequently soured in ""Identity Thief"" which cast her as an electronic kleptomaniac and turned her into a grotesque by upping the ante on her vulgarity. Now she has gone from bad to worse in the ""The Heat"" a crude--and clearly commercial--comedy in which she plays Mullins a loose bazooka of a Boston cop (yes she too wields one of those things) opposite Sandra Bullocks smug control-freaky Ashburn an FBI agent assigned to a Boston drug case. ENLARGE Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock 20th Century Fox Grotesque doesnt begin to describe Ms. McCarthys new character. Scarily insane comes closer; repulsive occasionally applies. Mullinss insanity can be extremely funny from time to time but her anger grows as punishing for the audience as it does for the victims of her unrestrained police work and Ms. Bullock is more to be pitied than censored in her thankless role of straight woman to a garrulous psychopath. ( Paul Feig directed from a script by Katie Dippold. Mr. Feig also directed ""Bridesmaids""; its one more reminder that life is full of mysteries.) ""The Heat 2"" has already been announced so the producers must have faith in this latest twist on the mismatched-buddies formula. One wonders though what the future holds for Ms. McCarthys career if every new film is going to exploit her more shamelessly than the previous one. Beware the long arm of the law of diminishing returns. Watch a clip from the film ""Im So Excited"" When it appears that a flight is doomed the flight crew and passengers look to forget the anguish of the moment and face the greatest danger which we carry within ourselves. (Photo/Video Sony) Im So Excited Theres never been a movie quite like Pedro Almodovars pastel-colored ""Im So Excited"" (in Spanish with English subtitles.) Its a gay farce with interludes of cabaret crossed with ""Airplane"" The setting is mostly the cockpit and business-class cabin of a crippled--and haunted--Airbus A340 thats stuck in a holding pattern over Toledo Spain; even the instrument-panel displays glow in the soft hues that the filmmaker loves. The pilots and flight attendants are sex-obsessed while the passengers who have their own sex-and-substance issues are madly impassioned compelled to tell their lurid stories and intricately connected by fate. (Economy-class passengers hardly figure in the action because theyve been drugged into submission by the crew.) The films gleeful celebration of sexuality recalls Mr. Almodovars earliest work but ""Im So Excited"" conveys an impression of the great man straining for laughs and of the story as an extended trifle he needed to get out of his system. ENLARGE A scene from Im So Excited El Deseo/Sony Pictures Classics That said some of it qualifies as first-class hilarity and all of the acting is superb. Lola Duenas defines droll as a dulcetly crazed psychic. Cecilia Roth is a faded queen of the gossip magazines and past mistress of the blackmailing arts. Javier Camara Carlos Areces and Raul Arevalo are flight attendants who create the comic zenith of the proceedings by coming together as an ad hoc trio and miming the Pointer Sisters hit ""Im So Excited."" I just cant hide my disappointment though that the movie doesnt sustain anything like the brilliance of its best scenes or even the promise of its preface with a couple of throwaway cameos by two superlatively engaging performers They play ground-crew workers involved in removing the wheel chocks that provoke the ""Airplane"" part of the plot. Jose Luis Alcaine was the cinematographer and Alberto Iglesias did the marvelous score. Watch a clip from the film ""The Attack."" An Arab surgeon living in Tel Aviv discovers a dark secret about his wife in the aftermath of a suicide bombing. Based on a novel by Yasmina Khadra. (Photo/Video Cohen Media Group) The Attack Before a terrorist attack that takes 19 lives and turns another life upside down Ziad Doueiris strong and sobering drama which goes into national distribution this week paints an appealing portrait of a happy man who has it all. Amin Jaafari played splendidly by Ali Suliman is an Arab-Israeli surgeon working at a hospital in Tel Aviv. Hes thoroughly assimilated has a wife he adores and is widely admired by his peers and his many Jewish friends. Then a suicide bombing at a nearby restaurant brings a stream of grievously injured survivors into the hospital and later the terrible news that Amins wife was among the victims and may in fact have been the suicide bomber. ENLARGE Reymond Amsalem and Ali Suliman Cohen Media Could Amin have known about his wifes political sympathies and radical inclinations? An Israeli friend--a captain in the Shin Bet Israels internal state-security agency--insists that he must have known and suddenly accuses him of being one of those ""fake seculars"" who conceal their Islamic roots. (In a drama of expert performances and otherwise deftly controlled polemics its unfortunate that the Shin Bet agent is portrayed as a brutish thug.) For his own part Amin finds his new situation unfathomable; how could he not have known who his wife had become let alone what murderous plot she was up to? Searching for answers he goes to the Palestinian territories--where hes suspected of being a Shin Bet agent--in hopes of tracking down the people who recruited her. What he learns in the process is how little he has known about himself having become the model of an integrated Arab by cutting himself off from what a fellow Palestinian describes as ""a ravaged people."" The director Mr. Doueiri left his native Lebanon to study film in the U.S.; between 1987 and 1997 he worked as an assistant camera operator and camera operator on films that included Quentin Tarantinos ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" This is his third feature film--he and Joelle Touma based the screenplay on the novel by Yasmina Khadra--and its remarkably accomplished and self-confident. In dramatic terms ""The Attack"" borrows a page from Alfred Hitchcocks playbook--an innocent in a strange land delving into dangerous matters he doesnt understand. In political terms though the script is unsparing and ultimately bleak. It doesnt justify terrorism but it does dramatize the rage and despair that dominate life in the occupied territories. Amin isnt innocent the film contends; he was simply ignorant of conditions that radicalized his wife and may now do the same to him. ENLARGE DVD Focus All the Presidents Men (1976) A different kind of story from a bygone era about bringing the White House down. Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman are Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein the Washington Post reporters--now enshrined in the history of journalism as Woodstein--who followed the Watergate money all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and were pivotal in the sequence of events that led to President Nixons resignation. Jason Robards is unforgettable as the Post editor Ben Bradlee. Hal Holbrook is Deep Throat. Alan J. Pakula directed from William Goldmans exemplary screenplay. The peerless Gordon Willis was the cinematographer. ENLARGE Infamous (2006) Sandra Bullock at her best--as an actress not a star--in a freely fictionalized film about Truman Capote and ""In Cold Blood"" that Douglas McGrath adapted from a George Plimpton book of interviews. Ms. Bullock is Nelle Harper Lee a novelist who uses spoken words with quiet precision. Toby Jones plays Capote as a charming aggressively gay elf who turns out to be a contemptible worm. The convicted killer Perry Smith is a deluded monster though forthright and strong as played by Daniel Craig who became the new James Bond in ""Casino Royale"" later the same year. ENLARGE Volver (2006) Lola Duenas looks like shes seen a ghost long after she knows better in Pedro Almodovars shaggy ghost story which is also a meditation on the culture of death; a slapstick comedy about disposing of a corpse; a celebration of sisterhood strong women and reconciliation; and a return therefore to some of the themes of Mr. Almodovars ""All About My Mother."" Ms. Duenas is Sole the heroines sister. Penelope Cruz as the heroine Raimunda is dazzling witty and mercurial yet all the while implacably grounded like the legendary Anna Magnani who shows up briefly on a TV screen. --J.M.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com WHITE HOUSE DOWN Share Comment Intentionally or not Roland Emmerichs ""White House Down"" is the comedy hit of the summer. No other film equals its comic sophistication. Each nutty scenario is surpassed by the next ludicrous story lines coalesce with expert orchestration and absurd details return with perfect timing to build to a crescendo of hilarity. By the time the flag waves on the White House lawn the audience with whom I watched this had lost it - Emmerich had knocked them dead. He also knocks them dead on the screen; the body count must be in quadruple digits. But sometimes thats what it takes for a father to prove himself to his kid and no doubt this reinforcement of family values was instrumental in getting the film a PG-13 rating.

"White House Down 4 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article White House Down 4 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO White House Down Good 4 stars Director Roland Emmerich.Cast Channing Tatum Jamie Foxx Jason Clarke Joey King Richard Jenkins James Woods. Rating PG-13 for violence language and a brief sexual image. By Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Jun 27 2013 435 PM Director Roland Emmerich specializes in big bombastic popcorn thrillers full of eye-popping destruction. Think ""Independence Day"" ""2012"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow. Now you can add ""White House Down"" to the list. Like those other movies ""White House Down"" is a bit square and old-fashioned. The dialogue sometimes clunks. But the film also delivers the requisite thrills and action and with strong likable actors filling up the lead roles its the kind of exciting escapist fare designed for summer viewing. The movie introduces us to a world in which the United States is ruled by charismatic President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) an Obama-like leader in more ways than one. After all his nightstand is filled with Nicorette gum a sly nod to the presidents personal battle with tobacco. Sawyer also loves living at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Upon seeing the White House on a return flight home he solemnly intones ""Be it ever so humble."" Clunky dialogue Exhibit A. John Cale (Channing Tatum) is a neer-do-well Capitol policeman with hopes of landing a gig on the Secret Service. After blowing a job interview for the position he winds up on a White House tour with his 11-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King). Perfect timing At the same moment a band of mercenaries (led by Stenz played by Jason Clarke) are attempting to take over the first familys digs. The White House was already under attack this year in ""Olympus Has Fallen"" a nifty thriller that wound up being a surprise hit. ""White House Down"" manages to avoid deja vu syndrome by boasting its own rhythms. Although ""Olympus"" was violent and full of flag-waving patriotism ""White House Down"" tempers the action with humor. The bantering relationship between the president and Cale is like something from a buddy-cop flick as opposed to a typical action movie. If ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Die Hard"" had a baby the offspring would look something like this. The stars work well together. Foxx in particular has a good time. Only in Hollywood do you get the president yelling at a terrorist ""Get your hands off my Jordans"" while smacking him in the face. Tatum brings a nice amount of gravity to Cale plus he runs around for a good portion of the movie in a wife-beater T-shirt pleasing the ""Magic Mike"" fans in the house. Emmerich has a solid group of actors including Maggie Gyllenhaal Richard Jenkins James Woods and Michael Murphy. He does especially well with young King a winning actress who manages to be cute and spunky without being insufferable. Clarke (""Zero Dark Thirty"") brings a terrific intensity as the terrorist who makes things personal. In one scene he is offered a piece of dessert. ""I dont want cake"" Stenz barks. ""Im a diabetic"" Somehow Clarke spins the line in a way thats hilarious and ominous at the same time. Along the way there is a plane crash a simultaneous attack on the Capitol helicopters racing through the streets of Washington and the presidential limo taking a dip in the White House pool. Its all very wow-inducing despite some major plot holes; then again who goes to a movie like this for realism? ""White House Down"" aims to be a low-brow slab of mindless summer fun. Most of the time it comes pretty close to hitting the bulls eye. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

June 28 2013 -- 937am Video (1746)  A wonderful example of a terrifically violent  laugh out loud funny good old fashioned slam-bam summer blockbuster entertainment. David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Amid the summer glut of brainless overproduced action movies do we really need a ""Die Hard"" movie set at 1600 Pennsylvania Av.? Well yes we do if it delivers such a jolt of lightning-bolt excitement that your system is still crackling hours later. ""White House Down"" is wonderfully violent and often laugh-out-loud funny a shopworn premise resuscitated as a sweaty rousing ironic intense movie-love-reaffirming free-for-all. Dateline Washington D.C. Channing Tatum is a divorced veteran working as a politicians bodyguard. Hes a scrapper but sensitive enough that his spunky preteen daughter (Joey King) can reduce him to a sad-eyed puppy with a few well-placed guilt darts. On the very day he stumbles through a Secret Service job interview the White House locks down under a terrorist assault. With his daughter inside. And the president played as an honorable Poindexter by Jamie Foxx. The demolition derby genre mandates a certain amount of predictability but Roland ""King of Smithereens"" Emmerich races us from one sweaty-palmed set piece to the next. Having blown the presidential residence to toothpicks in ""Independence Day"" Emmerich turns the East Wing West Wing and Oval Office into jungle gyms for bravura physical invention. With the presidents protection force out of commission Tatum improvs with whatever weapons come to hand. Theres a particularly nice moment in the presidential kitchen involving a toaster swung by the cord. Tatums everyman hero isnt eager to put himself in harms way. Before leaping into some daredevil encounter hell mutter under his breath ""This is really dumb."" The genius of the piece is that the audience responds ""Yeah. Go for it."" Tatum has never gravitated to manly-man roles and here he balances two-fisted acrobatics with his familiar mellow vibe. Foxx as the bespectacled Nicorette-chomping chief executive makes a great sidekick. With one foot firmly planted in the Tom Clancy action-thriller world the movie flirts with squirrelly deadpan humor in which preposterous stuff happens anyway. By the time the two are racing the presidential limo in circles while trying to aim a rocket launcher at their enemies you simply have to surrender to the moments trashy brilliance. Screenwriter James Vanderbilt (""Zodiac"" ""The Amazing Spider-Man"") realizes theres nothing less exciting than unrelenting action. He takes a stock story and turns it into an excuse to unleash expertly placed red herrings whip-smart comic surprises left-hook plot reversals and a bit of heart. Sony Channing Tatum left and Jamie Foxx center star in Columbia Pictures ""White House Down"" directed by Roland Emmerich. There are some fine actors here playing characters who surprise us. Emmerich gives Maggie Gyllenhaal James Woods and Richard Jenkins some nice moments in the spotlight. There are even some extraneous players who open up the story for a few moments to let it breathe. Nicolas Wright is a sneaky delight as a White House tour guide and Andrew Simms whimpers winningly as a blowhard political commentator caught in the crossfire. Those grace notes add a nice extra dimension to a film that never wastes a moment while laying waste to every structure on the White House grounds. You may see ""White House Down"" as a mindless escapist thriller. Your sister may see it as a raucous comedy. Foreigners may see it as a satire of America as a failed state. But everyone should see it.

Starring Channing Tatum Jamie Foxx Maggie Gyllenhaal and Richard Jenkins. Directed by Roland Emmerich. (PG-13. 131 minutes.) There will be greater cinematic achievements this year but for pure enjoyment for a good time at the movies for something that will delight and exhilarate and send audiences out laughing satisfied and thoroughly worked over its hard to imagine anything beating ""White House Down."" Directed by Roland Emmerich in his grand-scale action vein (""Independence Day"" ""2012"") ""White House Down"" escalates the pressure and stays ahead of the audience without ever degenerating into a series of random jolts. Theres a lot of expertise behind this film such an understanding of genre and of audience response that it makes the whole enterprise of creating big silly movies seem like a truly dignified calling. Maybe it is ""White House Down"" is going to make a lot of people happy for two-plus hours and thats worth doing. The movie is a smart balancing act in every way an exciting and sincere action thriller and yet one made with an awareness of other action thrillers so that there is just a hint of parody or self-parody. The movie asks you to take it seriously but not too seriously. At the same time there are moments of strong humor throughout that are essential to the experience but that dont for one second make ""White House Down"" any less tense or gripping. Emmerich has always had a sure command of tone but aided by James Vanderbilts script he has delivered his best movie to date. Channing Tatum has the main role but as everyone who sees ""White House Down"" is going to be talking about Jamie Foxx lets go there first. Theres a movie tradition going back decades that whenever theres a president in a movie he always looks a little like the sitting president. You might expect that thats whats happening with Foxx playing the president in the Barack Obama era but no this goes way beyond that. Foxx may be called ""President Sawyer"" in this but he is more or less playing Obama He has the clipped speech and the cool egghead vibe not to mention boxes and boxes of Nicorette in his desk drawers. As the movie starts he has a peace plan for the Middle East thats being held up in the House by a genial but intractable Republican speaker (Richard Jenkins) who is afraid what peace might do to his buddies in the defense industry. This president wants to make a difference in the world but all his political opponents care about is keeping him from being re-elected. Meanwhile its just another day off for Capitol policeman John Cale (Channing Tatum) who aspires to become a Secret Service agent. He takes his daughter Emily (Joey King) - who is obsessed with the president - on a White House tour. But as luck would have it he happens to choose a day when right-wing lunatics invade the White House with automatic weapons and take over the joint. Cale must be the unluckiest man since Bruce Willis in ""Die Hard."" In ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004) a disaster movie centered on global warning Emmerich showed his political slant with thinly disguised portraits of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney as a moron and a maniac respectively. But Emmerich was downright subtle there compared with his approach in ""White House Down"" which presents Obama as a hero - a Clark Kent just waiting to be Superman - and elements of the right as not merely wrong but unhinged. This is an action movie that will please everybody but for Democrats theres an extra prize inside the Cracker Jack box. ""White House Down"" continues Tatums rise toward his ultimate goal of becoming our eras handsome yet slightly befuddled lug the modern-day answer to Clark Gable. He is easy to watch and to care about. James Woods as the head of the Secret Service is meticulous and ill-tempered driven and skewed and its his best showcase in years. And Maggie Gyllenhaal provides another fine portrait in her gallery of women cursed with sanity in a world of insane men. But Foxxs portrayal of the president steals the show. Partly a celebration of Obama its also a barely disguised message directed at the sitting president instructing him to peel off the president suit and unleash the hero within. That makes ""White House Down"" unusual not just unusually good - the 2013 summer blockbuster most likely to still be interesting in 2014. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Comments click to enlarge White House Down Video Rated PG-13  137 minutes  2013 Roland Emmerich blew up the White House in Independence Day (1996) and does the same to the Capitol Dome here; now the only branch of government hes got left is the Supreme Court and those people cant run very fast. In this hard-charging fairly digestible thriller a Capitol policeman (Channing Tatum) takes his daughter on a White House tour and must come to the aid of the president (Jamie Foxx) during a military assault on the building. Politically Emmerich fakes toward the blue states (Foxx an obvious Obama stand-in wants to pull American forces out of the Middle East) before pitching to the red (by the end the commander-in-chief has learned how to fire a rocket launcher). But the lavish spectacle of Washington coming unglued may have its most eager audiences overseas where a movie like this really pulls in the bucks.

"Review White House Down is hard to believe easy to enjoy - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review White House Down is hard to believe easy to enjoy White House Down Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews the new movie White House Down starring Channing Tatum Jamie Foxx Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Woods. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews the new movie White House Down starring Channing Tatum Jamie Foxx Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Woods. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""White House Down"" is a hoot and a half a shameless popcorn entertainment that is preposterous and diverting in just about equal measure.This story of ""the worst day this country ever had"" -- a roughly 12-hour period when an armed paramilitary group blows up the Capitol and takes over the White House -- is very much something you get a kick out of against your better judgment. In fact if the amount of disbelief that needs to be suspended to enjoy this movie could be turned into dollars it would pay off the national debt with some money left over to buy star Channing Tatum director Roland Emmerich and screenwriter James Vanderbilt a round of beers.PHOTOS Movies Sneaks 2013 Emmerich as the 3 billion worldwide gross accumulated from films such as ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" indicates is a director with an instinct for the obvious a past master at making overblown versions of old-fashioned Saturday matinee-type stories.But though the director knows how to keep action moving hes done himself no favors in the past as a screenwriter. Here however he has the benefit of a script by James Vanderbilt (""Zodiac"" ""The Amazing Spider-Man"") that has a fine pulp premise and keeps the cringe-worthy lines to a minimum.Emmerich also has the great benefit of Tatum an actor who is ideally cast as the kind of regular guy you might not look at twice. Someone however who just happens to possess the kind of extraordinary skill set that comes in handy when the fate of this nation not to mention the entire free world is on the line. That kind of regular guy.Tatum plays John Cale a man with a dream. Yes Cales had a rough past including two combat tours overseas and an insubordinate personality thats made holding a job difficult but his aspirations extend all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Currently an employee of the U.S. Capitol Police assigned to guarding Speaker of the House Eli Raphelson (the veteran Richard Jenkins) Cale burns to be a Secret Service agent keeping watch over President James Sawyer (a low-key Jamie Foxx) an idealist whos pushing a controversial plan for peace in the Middle East.PHOTOS White House DownCale didnt even vote for Sawyer but hes a divorced dad in the doghouse with his sullen 11-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) and she just happens to be obsessed with all things White House.So when Dad wangles a job interview with the Secret Service inside the building (realistically duplicated by production designer Kirk M. Petruccelli in a series of Montreal sets) he brings Emily along.Unfortunately for Cale the person he has to go through to make the career change is Special Agent Carol Finnerty (a buttoned-down Maggie Gyllenhaal) who wouldnt you know it had a fling with Cale back in the day and is the last person likely to forgive his checkered past. Unwilling to break the bad news to Emily Cale takes her on a conveniently timed White House tour instead of leaving the building. Which would have ended the movie right there.For while Cale has been fruitlessly pleading his case a gang of nefarious intruders so suspicious looking they practically have ""terrorist"" tattooed on their foreheads have infiltrated the White House and under the leadership of Emil Stenz (""Zero Dark Thirtys"" Jason Clarke) make taking over the building look easy.Martin Walker (a strong James Woods) the outgoing head of the Secret Service and a man with problems of his own knows just the protocol to follow when things like this happen but its to no avail. Bullets are fired men are killed (though almost no blood is visible in this PG-13 film) and soon the dread words ""White House Down"" are heard in the land.It takes awhile for the aims of these terrorists to be revealed (and frankly they are never as clear as they might be) but it matters not. For John Cale and his daughter are among the folks being held hostage and that is no small thing.Special Agent Finnerty may have sniffed at Cales abilities (O ye of little faith) but they turn out to be formidable. Possibly the most resourceful man on the planet Cale is soon demonstrating every gift necessary to take on these heavily armed evildoers and keep the president safe. Lots of bullets head in his direction but the one with his name on it has yet to be made.Of course all of this is wildly implausible and completely silly if you stop to think about it. But the action in ""White House Down"" is so continuous and so convincingly photographed by cinematographer Anna Foerster -- even when it involves flaming helicopters and armed limo chases around the White House lawn -- that it rarely leaves you the leisure for mature reflection.Helping add verisimilitude are the actors especially Tatum and Foxx. They end up as a very unlikely buddy team able to share laughs -- as well as armaments. At 2 hours and 17 minutes ""White House Down"" goes on for too long and even by its own admittedly loose standards it has an ending that defies belief. But if this film had a sensible bone in its body it wouldnt be the kind of fun it turns out to be.kenneth.turanlatimes.com ---------------------------------White House DownMPAA rating PG-13 for prolonged sequences of action and violence including intense gunfire and explosions some language and a brief sexual imageRunning time 2 hours 17 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Action (Movie Genre) Politics and Government Entertainment Movies White House White House Down Channing Tatum White House Downs Channing Tatums secret to a happy marriage Amazing Spider-Man 2 Jamie Foxx is blue in the face as Electro Hey baby (I Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum [Music video] Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-white-house-down-20130628,0,5287669.story",200,whitehousedown24,whitehousedown,latimes

(AP Photo/Sony Columbia Pictures Reiner Bajo) Reiner Bajo This film publicity image released by Columbia Pictures shows Channing Tatum in a scene from ""White House Down."" (AP Photo/Sony Columbia Pictures Reiner Bajo) Pity the poor White House. Completed in 1800 the presidential residence was burned by the British in 1814 invaded by aliens in ""Mars Attacks"" and desecrated by the various bubbas and cowboys whove lived there. Just three months ago it was targeted by terrorists in ""Olympus Has Fallen."" But no one has been rougher on the residence than director Roland Emmerich. In 1996 he zapped it for ""Independence Day."" Now hes treating the Peoples House like the set of ""Animal House.""""White House Down"" is a buddy comedy disguised as a political thriller. Its full of malarkey but as a campaign of shock and awe its hard to resist.Any resemblance between President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) and the current occupant of the Oval Office is part of the joke. But this peacenik president makes Obama look like a loose cannon as Sawyer plans to sign a treaty with Iran and withdraw all U.S. troops from the Middle East. John Cale (Channing Tatum) is a decorated veteran of the Afghanistan war who works as a capital police officer and provides security for the Speaker of the House (Richard Jenkins). But Cales ultimate ambition is to join the Secret Service which would delight his history-buff daughter Emily (Joey King).On the day when divorced-dad Cale has his job interview (with old friend Maggie Gyllenhaal) he gifts Emily with a tour of the White House. Bad timing. Thats also the day when the head of the Secret Service (James Woods) uses his retirement party as a smokescreen to lead a commando attack on the Appeaser-in-Chief. When the smoke clears Emily is in the clutches of a mad-dog mercenary (Jason Clarke) and Sawyer is fleeing through the bowels of the mansion with his new friend Cale. Unlike the historic paintings furniture and fine china the heroes seem impervious to the bad guys bullets. Around the time that the president busts out his basketball shoes and street-corner vocabulary we realize were watching a very expensive parody of an action flick. Not even Michael Bay would dare to show the presidential limo doing donuts on the White House lawn for a worldwide news audience but Emmerich keeps upping the ante until hes forced to go nuclear. ""White House Down"" is no ""Dr. Strangelove"" but any movie that lets Channing Tatum channel his inner Sally Field and exclaim ""Not without my daughter"" gets our vote for the guiltiest pleasure of the season.What ""White House Down""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 210  Content Action violence and strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Roland Emmerichs White House Down is an entertaining throwback to the action blockbusters of the 1990s. Seemingly modeled on Die Hard With A Vengeance it pitches a wisecracking duo--one a cop the other a fidgety civilian--against an army of colorful bad guys. Theres a time limit a convoluted heist and some wanton destruction of public property. The cop is divorced wears a wife-beater shirt and is considered a screw-up by his colleagues; his name is John Cale which suggests that screenwriter James Vanderbilt is either a big Velvet Underground fan or that hes three letters and one drinking problem short of an intellectual-property lawsuit. The twist is that the civilian half of the duo happens to be the president of the United States an Obama stand-in played by Jamie Foxx; the cop played by Channing Tatum is a Capitol police officer who picks the wrong day to show up for an interview with the Secret Service. After a bomb goes off in the Capitol rotunda Tatum and Foxx find themselves joining forces against a motley band of white supremacists rogue ex-SEALs and hammy character actors who have taken the White House hostage as part of a scheme to steal the presidents nuclear launch codes. Its every bit as silly as it sounds--possibly even sillier. Yet while White House Down isnt going to score points for originality seriousness or subtlety (Emmerich likes his political messages blunt and loud) it is a lot of fun; if nothing else Emmerich is a great widescreen showman who knows how to stage mayhem on a grand scale. Compared to something like A Good Day To Die Hard his compositions and camera movements look downright elegant. (White House Down may be the only big-budget action movie released this year not to feature a single handheld shot or zoom.) Technically this marks the third time that Emmerich has obliterated 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue on screen (fourth counting its implied destruction in The Day After Tomorrow). However hes never been this thorough--putting a car chase on the South Lawn setting fire to the Lincoln Bedroom blasting holes in FDRs hand-carved piano setting off grenades in the Press Briefing Room. All of Emmerichs movies since Stargate have operated by identifying pop-cultural touchstones and myths (JFKs fabled secret tunnels serve the same function in this movie as Area 51 did in Independence Day) and then turning their destruction into spectacle. In White House Down he gets to cut loose on a building where every room and piece of furniture is iconic. He seems to get a kick out of watching them all burn and the mood--gleeful deranged and maybe just a little transgressive--is infectious.

Meets Die Hard Jamie Foxx (as POTUS) and Channing Tatum (as protector) make an engaging pair of First Buddies By Mary Pols MaryPolsJune 26 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Reiner Bajo / Columbia Pictures Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture How to categorize White House Down the new summer offering in which brutes take over the White House and imperil the safety of the free world with high-tech weaponry computer hacking and good old-fashioned head cracking? It certainly looks (and sounds) like an action movie a la Die Hard--its divorced blue collar hero John Cale (a charming Channing Tatum) even has a name that vaguely echoes John McClanes. Its director is Roland Emmerich who blew up the White House in Independence Day and is not too modest to reference the 1996 summer blockbuster in his new movie. But what makes White House Down not just tolerable but frivolously entertaining is its slapstick soul; a scene where the presidential limousine does doughnuts on the South Lawn plays like an homage to the Keystone Kops. This is the second 2013 movie to feature 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue under attack a President held hostage and a brave and brawny type risking his life to save him. Olympus Has Fallen imagined North Koreans as the occupiers while White House Down presents the more interesting fetid-elements-from-within situation. Gerard Butlers hero in Olympus had been a Secret Service agent in charge of the Presidential detail; Tatums Cale a military vet with two tours in Afghanistan is a Capitol Hill cop assigned to the Eeyore-like Speaker of the House (Richard Jenkins) but with aspirations to be part of the force protecting President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx). (READ Why White House destruction is so popular in movies) His motivation is patently ridiculous and Disney Channel cute; it seems his pouty 11-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King from Ramona and Beezus) loves the guy. Emily gets news alerts on her phone whenever POTUS is flying over her Washington neighborhood. (This civics-lesson plot point might lead parents to assume its perfectly O.K. to bring their own 11-year-olds to this PG-13 movie. But make no mistake this is a violent movie.) Meanwhile thanks to all those tours in Afghanistan her dad barely gets a grunted ""hello"" when he comes to get her for the weekend. Most parents desperate to please might download that obnoxious app the kid has been asking for but Cale goes big (and strange) bringing Emily to his interview at the White House. Hes quickly and briskly put in his place by a Secret Service hotshot named Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who finds him extremely underqualified for the job. And small world we learn they once hooked up in college. The first rule of White House Down is Question nothing. Not whether the Secret Service really conducts its interviews at the White House or your first instincts about the identity of the bad guy (because youd be right). And definitely not the narratively convenient confluence of coincidence and timing. The terrorists attack just as the Cales are joining a White House tour led by an amusingly officious tour guide named Donnie (Nicolas Wright). Father and daughter are separated creating one of those cinematic situations where a ""big"" decision has to be made Save the child--or save the world? (READ World War Z Brad Pitt vs. the Zombies) The movie doesnt actually make you think--there are no Bourne Identity complications to keep straight--but it makes you feel as if you had just a little. Its politics are left-leaning right down to the set dressing (you catch glimpses of the famous portraits of Jackie Kennedy and JFK but nary a Reagan or a Bush) but extraordinarily simpleminded. Everything gets explained as if to a sixth-grader. ""Youve heard of the military-industrial complex?"" President Sawyer asks Cale when theyre hiding out in an elevator shaft together. When Halliburton comes up I might have heard a disapproving hiss on the soundtrack. Sawyer is the big-screen version of Obama down to the Nicorette habit professorial bent and his smart strong First Lady. But hes an Obama new to office presented as such an idealistic pacifist (hes pulled all troops out of the Middle East and believes he can truly broker a peace agreement there) that he even The West Wings Jed Bartlet might suggest hes too much of a dove. The movie isnt in conflict with Sawyers politics but at the same time its intent is to get this guy to man up and pick up a rocket launcher. Foxx plays it for pure fun and hes just right in the part. He and Tatum have such easy chemistry and are so damn cute that the well-worn conceit of two opposites (here POTUS and protector) thrown together in a difficult situation hardly seems tired at all. (READ Pixars Monsters University When Hairy Met Scary) The movies bad guys are not its strong suit. I perked up when Zero Dark Thirtys Jason Clarke showed up but was disappointed when it turned out he was just the muscle and that the mastermind of the operation was being played by an actor whose name has long been synonymous with villain. (I wont reveal it here.) But the action sequences are pretty swell (even if some of the D.C. overhead sequences are too blatantly computer-generated). ""Were going to put this bird at 30000 feet in 45 seconds"" says the Air Force Two pilot attempting to whisk the Vice President (Michael Murphy) to safety and watching it race up that trajectory my stomach responded accordingly. Emmerich (The Day After Tomorrow and 2012) is obviously an expert in staging disasters but I question particularly in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings whether Americans under direct attack--the Capitol building is blown up in an early sequence--would really would crowd into the streets to watch rather than taking cover. Since the release of Man of Steel there have been a number of laments in the media about how much destruction is involved in recent movies. Its not an unreasonable complaint but the notion that it would take anyone until 2013 to start complaining about this strikes me as more shocking than any property damage. The first Die Hard movie came out in 1988 Independence Day in 1996. Its definitely gross and probably symptomatic of something twisted in the worlds soul but weve been burning down the cinematic house for decades. At least White House Down which ends with Donnie the tour guide conceding that it might take a ""few weeks"" to get the tours back on track winks at the audience as it does so.

The TV talking heads start pontificating Could it be those damn Arabs? Nope merely a group of disgruntled American militants led by a traitorous government operative (James Woods) who are out for vengeance and a huge payday. Fortunately low-rung Secret Service agent John Cale (Channing Tatum) is on the premises. He quickly teams up with the more-resourceful-than-he-looks POTUS and both of em start showing these unpatriotic bastards a bullet-riddled thing or two. There should be a special kind of charge in seeing even a fictional leader of the free world brandishing a comically oversize rocket launcher (expect plenty of ""O-BLAM-a"" memes to surface on ye ol Interwebz). But director Roland Emmerich has been to this self-mockingly jingoistic well way too often. What played as rousingly dumb fun in Independence Day (1996)--all those pie-eyed nationalistic monologues and U.S. landmarks reduced to rubble--now come off as callously insensitive even with tongue firmly in cheek. It doesnt help that all the action scenes as with many modern Hollywood blockbusters are seemingly edited with a Cuisinart or that the copious CGI would barely pass muster in one of those Asylum DTV quickies. Cheap shoddy dull instantly forgettable--this is the America and American cinema we know all too well.

Emil Stenz was nothing like Hans Gruber and WHD actually made the taking over an inside job with diversions which makes sense and isnt just a moronic air raid like OHF did. The film makes plenty of sense and doesnt try to be too serious. The critics were just too harsh on it. An ""F""? Seriously? Steven Hassesaid on Monday December 09 2013 35102 PMIll take your word for it I rarely see you give anything an ""F"" robertsaid on Sunday August 18 2013 23823 PMI love how neither Roeper nor anyone in this god forsaken comments section understand that this film is SELF-AWARE Ginnasaid on Thursday July 11 2013 121241 PMOld greedy power-hungry war-mongering white men vs. peace-loving black president -- what a great idea for a movie So original so hip so true No left-leaning self-congratulatory stereotypes here no siree. No disgustingly overweight midwestern couple asking annoying questions no leather-vested white-supremacist mercenaries no overarching evil from the corporate WAR MACHINE -- on no wait that was another movie Olympus Has Fallen. White House Down has all of that . . . and more. More agenda driven predictability than anyone might want to sit through. It turns out that Americas enemies are her own people. Oh boo not again Rob Pollardsaid on Wednesday July 10 2013 12112 PMWhile there were some funny moments and the special effects are great the movie overall was pretty terrible. As Roeper notes they repeatedly put the little girl in mortal danger (which is supposed to fit the funny tone of parts of the movie how?) and the characters (not to mention the army/govt outside the White House gates) always make the stupidest decision possible. Also the media gets info in literally minutes that would normally take months to uncover. Id say a D is fair but I can live with his F. Bobbysaid on Sunday July 07 2013 100901 PM F is to good of a grade for this Bomb Glennsaid on Sunday July 07 2013 121546 PMThe president wears Jordans and shoots a bazooka. An F looks good to me. Mike Ksaid on Saturday July 06 2013 42800 PMAn F? Thats a little rough. It had some good actors in it (James Woods Jamie Foxx Maggie G.) They did what they could with it. There were some funny moments. It didnt deserve an F. ""The Ugly Truth"" deserves an F. I walked out of that one after thirty-five minutes. You devalue the F when you give it to a movie that is meerly mediocre. Marksaid on Monday July 01 2013 105346 PM......so skip it? Oh who am I kidding? The title and poster alone made me forget this. The thought of seeing this movie makes me wonder if I have what it takes to be a movie critic. I feel like someone (in this case Mr. Roeper you) have taken a bullet for me. I thank you.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EDT June 26 2013This Die Hard-like thriller relies on the chemistry of Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx.Channing Tatum right stars as a veteran and Capitol Hill police officer who must protect the president (Jamie Foxx) after a terrorist attack on the White House.(Photo Reiner Bajo Sony Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 stars out of fourStars Channing Tatum Jamie Foxx Maggie Gyllenhaal Richard Jenkins James Woods Jason ClarkeRated PG-13; Runtime 2 hours 11 minutes; Opens in select cities Thursday and nationwide Friday""Tours over"" yells a shotgun-toting terrorist who takes a group of Washington D.C. visitors hostage in the preposterous White House Down.But the fireworks have just begun.With its well-choreographed mayhem Down (  1/2 out of four; rated PG-13 opens in select cities Thursday and nationwide Friday) is an over-the top Die Hard-style thriller that will make pulses race more than the recent similarly themed Olympus Has Fallen. While director Roland Emmerich (Independence Day) piles on outlandish scenarios the chemistry of the lead actors mitigates the contrived setup and numbing explosions.Just after President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) announces his plan to pull American troops out of the Middle East an insurrection plot is set in motion.After serving heroically in Afghanistan John Cale (Channing Tatum) works as a police officer assigned to security for Speaker of the House Raphelson (Richard Jenkins). Cale is endearing thanks to his self-deprecating humor low-key swagger and commitment to regain the love of his estranged 11-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King). It also helps that he braves a legion of guerrillas to single-handedly protect the president even after getting turned down for a spot in the Secret Service.VIDEO Foxx Tatum bring the House down MORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs summer movie calendarTo ensure that this 150 million movie makes a killing overseas the terrorists are homegrown. A motley crew of Americans unaffiliated with any ideology -- other than wanting to blow stuff up -- takes over POTUS stately home and wreaks havoc.Sawyer is overtly Obama-esque Hes an inspiring orator a levelheaded leader and a devoted family man and he is criticized for being too scholarly. Hes even a former smoker. But this is Hollywoods D.C. so when enough has clearly become enough the commander in chief whips off his wingtips slips into athletic shoes and lobs a rocket launcher at the bad guys.Foxx has just the right blend of dignity smarts and affability to make us want to vote for him. Tatum is a consistently likable Everyman who proves his mettle a la Bruce Willis in the Die Hard movies -- with less smirking.Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Carol Finnerty a Secret Service official who rejects Cale as a job applicant despite his war-hero status mostly because he got Cs in college. Cue mass audience sympathy. Making him even more lovable Cale has brought Emily along for a White House tour following his interview. Thats why theyre in the house so to speak when the rebels take over.All disbelief must be checked at the theater door. Emmerichs White House has less security than the tiniest airport pre-9/11. A janitor is actually packing bombs as are the alleged repairmen working in the presidents private theater. A crowd watches a car chase with Cale and Sawyer in a presidential limo being shot at by rebels on the White House lawn.None of the actions taken by administration officials during the takeover make a lick of sense. So its best to simply sit back and enjoy the camaraderie of Tatum and Foxx as they narrowly avert disaster.Who can resist a war hero willing to risk everything to protect his adorable daughter and his high-minded president in one movie?

I dont mean that as a backhanded compliment. Seriously. It takes a certain kind of genius to crank out blockbusters as spectacularly silly as Independence Day The Day After Tomorrow and 2012. And the main difference between Emmerich and fellow maestros of mayhem like Michael Bay is that he actually seems to be in on the joke. He knows his movies are preposterous nonsense and he embraces it. In his latest big-budget excuse to blow up 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue White House Down Emmerich doesnt waste time with anything as conventional as a setup; he just dives right in introducing us to Channing Tatums John Cale a divorced Capitol police officer itching to be a Secret Service agent to impress his daughter (Joey King). While his job interview in the West Wing is going south right-wing mercenaries take over the White House demanding 400 million. Meanwhile Cales daughter has been taken hostage and the president (Jamie Foxx) is left unguarded. Guess who steps in to protect the POTUS? Emmerich and screenwriter James Vanderbilt (The Amazing Spider-Man) rip off Die Hard beat for beat. But when youre having this much fun why quibble? The entire film is merely an excuse for Tatum to squeeze off machine-gun rounds in a muscle-baring tank top Foxx to do his cool-cat Obama impression right down to chomping on Nicorette and Emmerich to revel in what he does best -- blast the sets (and plausibility) to kingdom come. Comparisons between this and last Marchs similarly themed Olympus Has Fallen are going to be inevitable so let me just say that Emmerichs is the D.C. disaster flick to see. Skip it and youll be depriving yourself of one of the summers most satisfyingly stupid pleasures. B- Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

All Rights Reserved. Surprising proof that Hollywood still can craft a memorable studio comedy Roland Emmerichs White House Down stands as a singular achievement in parody its auteurs intentions be damned. Its not just a pitch-perfect attack on every risible plot point afflicting todays all-exposition-and-explosion filmmaking its also a mad liberals vision of an America beset by white wingnut terrorists set in a sketch-comedy White House so broad that if you didnt know Jamie Foxx was starring as its president you might guess it to be Leslie Nielsen. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Apologies if revealing that the terrorists are Stormfront-types strikes you as a spoiler. Doing justice to the breadth of hilarity on display here will involve divulging some details but the film is as crazy-dumb durable as a Twinkie. Lifetimes could pass with me spilling its secrets and it would still sit there spongy and triumphant.That would include celebrating in point-by-point specifics the delicious way every single thing any person says or does in the first half-hour pays off much later in the most rousing ridiculous ways--in moments audiences will applaud out of appreciation that at last the most shameless tricks of the most shameless directors have been exposed by a master satirist. Remember the hurt you felt when Spielberg in that Jurassic Park sequel threw a set of uneven bars into a dino-island storage shed just so the acrobatic skills the tween daughter had mentioned on the mainland could come back to dispatch those raptors? A bit of flag-team heroism in White House Down does to that moment what Airplane did to Airport what Walk Hard did to Walk the Line what Emmerichs own The Day After Tomorrow did to real global warming. The tragic is inflated to sublime comedy.Film Details White House Down RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time137 More Info Trailer (Sorry spoiler for Jurassic Park The Lost World.)Anyway if a stupid moment has turned up in too many movies its here too only funnier. I probably shouldnt mention that a straight-arrow characters weirdly comic ringtone--""The Spanish Flea""--heard in the first 15 minutes might happen to be crucial in the last 10. Or that theres key exposition embedded in the scene where a know-it-all kid schools a White House tour guide--a tour guide who later stands up to armed murdering terrorists to defend a precious vase. (Pronounced vahzz of course just like Margaret Dumont would. She was also in comedies) Or the way that Emmerich--whose other comic mode is idiot destruction a la Jonathan Winters at the gas station in Its a Mad Mad World--actually finds a way to stage a car chase without leaving the White House. Three armored SUVs circle the North Lawn Fountain like Chevy Chases family stuck in the Parisian roundabout in European Vacation which is nowhere near as funny as this movie. Then the president of the United States fires a rocket launcher out the window of a car while terrorists are machine-gunning him--a vicious burlesque perhaps of Harrison Fords President Bad-Ass back in Air Force One.There is a story to all this. Set in a science-fiction America where nobodys ever seen Die Hard White House Down imagines that in the name of peace wise President Jamie Foxx has asked Congress to pull every American troop from the Middle East because he has struck a bargain with the new president of Iran. The opposition partys speaker of the house objects for some reason. Meanwhile Channing Tatum (playing a character whose name I bet he too would have to look up) is visiting the White House with his YouTubing scamp of an estranged daughter (Joey King)--a devastating critique of movies impossible children.Tatum playing a war-hero D.C. cop interviews for a job with the Secret Service and is told by his old friend Maggie Gyllenhaal that ick hes too working-class to guard the president because he got Cs in college. So his dreams shot and his daughter not believing in him Tatum slumps along with a White House tour his overcooked plight skewering a common fallacy of Hollywood heroism Every one of this characters personal problems are solved by the bad guys evil scheming.Just in time cue the terrorists who are actually more than mere rightwing cranks. I wont spill their leaders affiliation but I will give this hint Its with one of the industrial complexes.From there we get the most sharply observed spoof comedy since Team America. All the conventions of PG-13 suspense films take their well-deserved knocks The dozens of dead hardly bleed the word ""fuck"" is only spat once during the greatest crisis Americas ever faced children endlessly weep with guns in their faces. (""What monsters would take this material seriously?"" the movie seems to be asking.) Eventually Foxx and Tatum team up kill some assholes tenderly treat each others wounds and leave you hoping the producers ponied up for the rights to play ""I Will Always Love You."" The shootouts arent as clear or funny as the ones in those paintball episodes of Community but youve seen much worse.My favorite bit Foxx says early on in a bang-on parody of a vapid hopeful speech that his peace plan will prove the pen is mightier than the sword. Later (spoiler) in the Oval Office the chief bad guy quotes that back. Guess what non-weapon object President Foxx then jabs into his neck. Come on--guessOften the hilarity is indisputably intentional. If you think youll laugh and clap try it; if you know youll hate it youre right. A fun drinking game Once the dramatic eight-minute countdown clock starts estimate how long it takes to get near zero. I guess at least 25 minutes.Follow VoiceFilmClub 2 Photo by Reiner Bajo - (c) 2013 Columbia Pictures Industries Inc. All Rights Reserved.

"Review ""White House Down doesnt live up to expectations - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview ""White House Down doesnt live up to expectationsBy Randy MyersContra Costa Times CorrespondentPosted 06/26/2013 103000 AM PDTUpdated 06/26/2013 054905 PM PDTRelated StoriesJun 27Hicks White House Down could signal end of spy thrillers for a whileTheres an underappreciated art to making fun but ridiculous action films that literally blow reality to smithereens. Director Roland Emmerich has proved himself to be a specialist at it with lug-headed yet appealing crowd-pleasers such as ""The Day After Tomorrow"" ""Independence Day"" and ""2012.""Those guilty pleasures were excessive in every way from their frenetic Wile E. Coyote action sequences down to their impressive A-list casts. And they worked. But while Emmerichs ""White House Down"" mostly sticks to the same formula this latest cinematic assault on the Oval Office fails to deliver on the campaign promise that it will be as fun as the original ""Die Hard."" It also pales in comparison to ""Olympus Has Fallen"" a far more violent and intense takedown of the White House from earlier this year that starred Gerard Butler and Morgan Freeman. To be fair ""Olympus"" is very different in tone from ""Down"" which wants to be more of an homage to buddy action films of yore. In that arena it serves the public well enough especially when its playing it for laughs. But ""Down"" tries way too hard stuffing in so many crackpot twists that attempts at genuine tension all but vanish.The half-hour setup bodes well as screenwriter James Vanderbilt (""The Amazing Spider-Man"") introduces us to the major players the idealistic President James Swayer (Jamie Foxx); the cuckoo outgoing Secret Service commander Martin Walker (James Woods); the tough Special Agent Carol Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal); and the superbaddie in need of a good teeth cleaning Emil Stenz (Jason Clarke). Advertisement The best character is John Cale (Channing Tatum) a harried dad and ex-military man stuck serving the grumbling Speaker of the House (Richard Jenkins).Cale played with immense likability by Tatum gets a shot at redemption when he and the president get trapped in the White House and play dodgeball with the hooligans who take it over. The Oval Office goes down just after Sawyer announces hes withdrawing all troops from the Middle East. Coincidence? What do you think?Cale is in the White House while on a tour with his precocious daughter (Joey King) when all the mayhem begins. He brought her with him for a Secret Services job interview with Finnerty a former classmate. Naturally father and daughter are separated and Vanderbilt pushes the father theme throughout ""White House Down"" showing us the extremes that dads will go to for their children. But any aspirations to come up with a message are drowned out by car cashes a plane crash bombs and gunfire -- you name it.The best parts of ""White House Down"" come when Tatum and Foxx are foiling the tattooed thugs. Their banter elevates the film even as it gets progressively strangled by an avalanche of cliches and absurd plot high jinks. Cast member Channing Tatum arrives for the premiere of the film ""White House Down"" in New York June 25 2013. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson (UNITED STATES - Tags ENTERTAINMENT) (LUCAS JACKSON) Still there are clever flourishes here and there The fictional president in a wink to Barack Obama has his nightstand filled with Nicorette gum and a zealous tour guide provides needed comic relief. There are just not enough of those moments. The cast although slumming it is good. Foxx makes a fine president Woods is a complicated villain and Gyllenhaal plays a smart strong female character. But Tatum owns the film. He is funny and endearing. And sorry to say Bruce Willis He looks better in a white sleeveless undershirt than you did in ""Die Hard.""Yet none of that star power can save ""White House"" from ultimately going down. A more refined screenplay and less octane in the directors gas tank might have done the trick. As is it makes a yipee-ki-yay thud.WHITE HOUSE DOWN   Starring Channing Tatum Jamie Foxx Maggie Gyllenhaal Richard Jenkins Jason Clarke James Woods Joey KingRating PG-13 (for prolonged sequences of action violence including intense gunfire and explosions some language and a brief sexual image)Director Roland EmmerichRunning Time 2 hours 17 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

The actual franchise addition ""A Good Day to Die Hard"" was a frequently incoherent rehash of what once made those movies endearing while the similarly-set ""Olympus Has Fallen"" took down the White House with garish sprays of digital blood and frustratingly dim lighting. Fortunately ""WHD"" director Roland Emmerich has two capable leads and a hefty budget in his favor; unfortunately he and writer James Vanderbilt may have cribbed even more exhaustively from the now 25-year-old Bruce Willis classic. We have John Cale (Channing Tatum) a D.C. cop looking to join the Secret Service and improve his standing with 11-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) the kind of kid who insists on calling Dad by his first name so we know that he has some work to do. His ex-wife (Rachelle Lefevre) reminds him that Cale was never there for them; a former flame Agent Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) concludes his job interview by reminding him and us that he never finishes anything. Might he be able to prove all the women in his life wrong by being the one man to fend off the dozens of terrorists who have come to claim President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) in the midst of John and Emilys White House tour? Lets put it this way it takes maybe an hour before Cale is running around 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in a stained tank top dodging bullets and exchanging banter with Sawyer whose own detractors in the wake of a proposed troop withdrawal from the Middle East remind him and us that hes never seen a day of action in his life. Oh but just they wait until this Commander-in-Chief is wielding a rocket launcher from his bulletproof limousine. Does it get sillier from there? Oh yes. After all were talking about a movie where a tour guide refers to the White House as ""the building famous for being blown up in Independence Day."" ""ID4"" was of course directed by Mr. Emmerich who similarly ravaged the globe in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""2012"" after having his way with American history in ""The Patriot."" Anyone worried that ""WHD"" would be a grim exercise in domestic destruction couldnt be blamed -- the eradication of the Capitol Building and Air Force One can only come off so lightly -- but trust that Emmerichs touch is as broad as ever resulting in high-speed chases low-flying helicopters hidden bunkers hidden tunnels hidden agendas and perhaps the single most risible climactic gesture since a gymnast kicked a velociraptor off a roof in ""The Lost World Jurassic Park."" With positively Spielbergian beams of light shining in through every possible window Emmerichs reverence for all-American derring-do is not just apparent but insistent throughout. Even more striking though is Vanderbilts greater reverence for the original ""Die Hard."" We have Tatums lone hero trying to save an estranged family member; James Woods coolly professional ringleader whose plot to rob the Federal Reserve is merely a diversion for Something Bigger; Jason Clarkes hot-headed henchmen; Gyllenhaals outsider trying to navigate the situations increasingly macho power plays; Kings suddenly valuable hostage; a snivelling reporter; an especially cocky computer hacker; a failed helicopter approach; a thwarted tank attack... Then again the modern-cowboy-thwarting-terrorists rite of passage is well-known by many an action star at this point from Steven Seagal Sylvester Stallone Wesley Snipes Keanu Reeves and Jean-Claude Van Damme to Harrison Ford in the easily superior ""Air Force One"" Tomer Sisley in last years ""Sleepless Night"" and Guy Pearce in ""Lockout."" It seems only fair that stud of the moment Tatum gets his turn and he performs his quip-happy trigger-happy duties with expected charm and muscle. An advantage over Gerard Butler fulfilling the same role in ""Olympus"" is the opportunity to team up with Foxx the scripts equivalent of saddling McClane with Powell in person albeit with Powell being a considerably fitter man who happens to bear the burden of protecting a nation while decked out in his Air Jordans. Their nigh-instantaneous camaraderie makes the alternately corny and convoluted routine of the rest a bit easier to take even as Emmerich makes every effort to supplant intelligence with patriotism. At best ""White House Down"" is a sure-fire way to kill two hours if not countless brain cells and let me assure you that neither will die softly.

(Reiner Bajo) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Wednesday June 26 2013 1201 AM Title White House Down Film Info A D.C. cop and the President fight terrorists. Director Roland Emmerich. (217). PG-13 Violence language. Area theaters. Opens Thursday night. It may be hard to know the mind of the President of the United States. But for a glimpse into the brain of an action director we have ""White House Down."" Roland Emmerich the filmmaker whose symphonies of smash have included ""Independence Day ""Godzilla"" and ""2012"" throws every clunky blockbuster cliche into ""WHD."" There are echoes here from ""Die Hard"" ""Lethal Weapon"" ""Speed"" ""Air Force One"" and many others. Luckily theres also Jamie Foxx bringing stately snark to the role of President James Sawyer a commander-in-chief facing what a press secretary might call ""a crisis"" In the middle of an ordinary day terrorists attack 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. from the inside. Its soon revealed that a superteam of baddies -- tattooed Eastern Europeans with nefarious mustaches an angry hacker right-wing extremists and pissed-off patriots -- are taking their orders from the turncoat Secret Service chief (James Woods). But the terrorists didnt count on John Cale (Channing Tatum) being in the house. Cale is a wanna-be Secret Service agent toiling as a member of the Speaker of the Houses security detail (an officious bureaucrat played by Maggie Gyllenhaal wont let him join the big leagues). Hes on a White House tour with his daughter Emily (Joey King) when things go down. Cale and the Prez hit the tunnels under the West Wing but Emily a White House trivia expert is a target. Cale must save her democracy and the world. Perhaps afraid that watching a symbol of liberty repeatedly go boom isnt enough Emmerich and screenwriter James Vanderbilt add family drama an attack on Congress a plane crash and the possible nuking of the Middle East. What isnt tonally jarring ends up shatteringly inept. Its also much too much especially after the similar (and in retrospect better) ""Olympus Has Fallen."" Here complaining about 9/11-ish imagery is like saying ""Earthquake"" was insensitive to earthquake victims In all the craziness its hard to be offended. Emmerichs film though does have a few tricks up its sleeve. A snarling Woods scratches up the scenery as a bulldog with a buzz cut and Tatum though sold as a side of beef still works his appealing everyguy charm. Foxx is as always a stabilizing force even as the slapdash goofiness gets out of control. (Thousands throng to watch the attack? Really?) He earns a solid vote of confidence as a sneaker-clad POTUS who kicks a villain off him by ordering ""Hands off my Jordans"" Despite the ""White House Down"" madness we can at least say hail to the chief. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"White House Down Review Channing Tatum Stars in a Welcome Blockbuster Throwback | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review White House Down Scott Foundas Chief Film Critic foundasonfilm 11 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr June 25 2013 | 0900PM PT Roland Emmerich delivers a welcome throwback to an earlier more generously entertaining era of summer blockbusters. Its open season on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- yet again -- in Roland Emmerichs ""White House Down"" a slick high-concept actioner that has the unusual distinction of arriving several months after its bargain-basement knockoff Antoine Fuquas ""Olympus Has Fallen."" Itself owing much to such lone-man-of-action hallmarks as ""Die Hard"" and ""Speed"" this welcome throwback to an earlier more generously entertaining era of summer blockbusters delivers a wide array of close-quarters combat and large-scale destruction all grounded in an immensely appealing star turn by Channing Tatum and ace support from imperiled POTUS Jamie Foxx. Though unlikely to rival career-best Emmerich grossers ""Independence Day"" and ""2012"" in the outer reaches of the box office stratosphere pic should net a tidy profit for Sony helping to salve the still-fresh wounds of ""After Earth."" Setting aside the question of whether the world really needed a second White House takeover movie in terms of sheer craftsmanship and professionalism ""White House Down"" is to ""Olympus Has Fallen"" what ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was to the 1985 Richard Chamberlain-Sharon Stone version of ""King Solomons Mines."" Though both pics were majority shot far from the actual Beltway -- ""Olympus"" in Louisiana and ""White House"" in Montreal -- Emmerichs film is a far better sell from production designer Kirk M. Petruccellis enormously impressive replica set to the visual effects by longtime Emmerich collaborators Volker Engel (an Oscar winner for ""Independence Day"") and Marc Weigert. Relatively speaking the new pic is shrewder politically too giving us an enemy from within Americas own borders in place of ""Olympus"" central-casting North Korean baddies. SEE MORE Roland Emmerich Again Bets the House Emmerich also offers the screens most overtly Obama-esque commander-in-chief to date in the form of Foxxs James Sawyer a self-styled Lincolnian who gets his kicks from buzzing the Lincoln Memorial in Marine One and even carries a pocket watch that once belonged to Honest Abe himself. Hes also in the words of one Tea Party-ish detractor ""an academic who never served a day in his life"" and his controversial plan to withdraw all U.S. troops from the Middle East has ruffled more than a few feathers in the military-industrial Complex. Tatums John Cale by contrast has done his time in the trenches -- three tours of duty in Afghanistan to be precise. During one of them he saved the life of a fellow soldier whose uncle happens to be the speaker of the House (Richard Jenkins) earning Cale his current job as a Capitol policeman assigned to the speakers security detail. Somewhere in those same years Cales personal life went bust leaving him with an ex-wife and moody preteen kid to try to win back -- an outcome in the grand scheme of movies like this that can often be hastened by some extravagant act of heroism. Strict narrative logicians be forewarned The cheerfully preposterous coincidences pile up in ""White House Down"" faster than the body count. Just as a certain John McClane found himself in a Los Angeles office building at the exact moment of a brazen hostage taking so too does Cale turn up at the White House in the hours before some suspicious-looking home-theater repairmen drop their A/V equipment and break out the big guns (something it must be said that the pic makes look so easy you cant help wondering if the prez left the keys to the front door under the mat). Cale has come for a job interview to join the presidents Secret Service team -- an idea of which he is quickly disabused by Special Agent Carol Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) a former college classmate who rattles off a detailed inventory of Cales lifelong failure to live up to his potential. (One more doubter to disprove) Adding insult to injury Cale has brought his president-obsessed daughter Emily (Joey King) along for the day in a touching effort to convince her he isnt a total failure. When she insists they stick around for an official White House tour he reluctantly agrees which is right around the time that all hell breaks loose. Just what these particular bad guys are after is something ""White House Down"" reveals gradually with a few red herrings along the way. What comes to light relatively early in a modestly provocative twist on the usual terrorist m.o. is that theyre all disgruntled Americans with ideological axes to grind including an ex-CIA contractor who did ""black bag"" work in Pakistan played in a sly bit of casting by head ""Zero Dark Thirty"" interrogator Jason Clarke. That an about-to-retire Secret Service chief is also mixed up in this will come as a surprise only to those who miss the characters introductory scene  --glowering into the camera as he removes an Old Glory lapel pin and tells his wife hell ""be home late"" tonight -- or who have never before seen the actor playing said role James Woods. But ""White House Down"" isnt really selling novelty or invention. Its a sturdy old-fashioned bit of escapism that keeps delivering the goods and finds its own small ways of toying with our expectations. In one of screenwriter James Vanderbilts niftier touches Cale doesnt spend the movie trying to rescue Sawyer but rather on the run with the president looking for Emily and plotting their escape. This affords Tatum and Foxx a lot of shared screen time in which they project an effortless ingratiating chemistry that recalls Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the first ""Lethal Weapon"" pic the characters bonding as fathers and patriots whenever they arent dodging bullets. For much of the pics first half Emmerich keeps the action on a relatively human scale with Cale and Sawyer engaging the evildoers in tight claustrophobic spaces including a dumbwaiter shaft and the first kitchen. Eventually the film makes its way to the South Lawn for a spirited loop-de-loop car chase involving the bulletproof presidential limo and to a looming military air strike that threatens to do to the White House what aliens did to it in ""Independence Day."" Throughout Emmerich harbors no greater goal than to keep the audience mindlessly entertained at which he generally succeeds -- so much so that one is compelled to overlook the niggling particulars like the fact that Woods Clarke et al. make for a villain collective ultimately more incompetent than terrifying. Where ""Olympus Has Fallen"" weighed heavy with ra-ra jingoism ""White House Down"" proffers a more innocent kind of Americana up to and including a climactic setpiece that tips its hat without a lick of irony to the War of 1812. The movies most special effect is without doubt Tatum who gives Cale a strong rooting interest well before the first shots are fired. As in ""Magic Mike"" hes ideally cast as a kind of thinking mans lunkhead who makes up in common sense coolness under pressure and sheer likability what he lacks in book smarts. And though ""White House Down"" fails to include any proper dance numbers Tatums physical grace is on ample display as he tumbles and glides through one cacophonous action melee after the next. Newcomer King also registers a strong impression as the precocious tyke who runs intellectual circles around her dad (but also proves a chip off the old block where staring down her captors is concerned) while Nicolas Wright offers typically goofy Emmerich-style comic relief as a know-it-all White House tour guide.

Statements like ""Weve spent a trillion dollars on war in the past ten year. Imagine if wed spent that money building schools and infrastructure in the same countries""...like its the U.S. responsibility to do so? Every black guy is a saint. All the bad guys are white racists and rogue ex-military. At the end all the Middle East countries (Iran Saudi Arabia Israel etc.) join hands to unite behind the black presidents proposal for peace. The premise of the movie is that it could happen if we just tried. This flick is pure propaganda promoting a naive liberal utopia wrapped in a so-called adventure movie. This is Hollywood unabashedly pumping up the left-wing agenda and calling it entertainment. Reply Joe Smart says June 30 2013 at 938 am What if we spent the trillion dollars on schools and infrastructure here? Or do you just like blowing up stuff if its in other countries and you and your family members arent the ones getting killed? Since you want to turn White House Down into a discussion of the military industrial complex in the United States answer me this-what exactly did we accomplish with our ten plus years of war? Bush drove the Taliban out of power in Afghanistan and they will be back in power within two years of our troop pull-out. With the Iraq war we turned Iran (a member of Bushs axis of evil) into the most powerful country in the region and the rulers of Iraq by proxy. Iraq is also selling most of its oil to China who isnt exactly one of our closest allies. So what did we accomplish exactly other than helping to create massive debt here that Republicans insist necessitates cuts to social security medicaid medicare food stamps student loans school lunches for poor children etc. We go to war. Haliburton gets rich. The poor get shafted. It sounds like the politics of White House Down might be naive but if they are critical of our recent military incursions into the middle east then theyre not inaccurate. Reply Joe says June 26 2013 at 511 pm So does it make you feel good about yourself to insult a movie you havent seen and by extension the people who want to see it? Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says June 26 2013 at 125 pm My prejudice here is without compunction. WHITE HOUSE DOWN admittedly based on its trailer (and to a lesser degree this film reviewer) seems hopelessly mediocre. The plot is not shrewd in hosting ""the enemy within"" unless some reference is being made to how the Secret Service failed President John F. Kennedy in Dallas. The story and characters successfully limn DIE HARD (and according to the trailer clumsily mocks AIR FORCE ONE). Jamie Foxx -- outside his role as Ray Charles -- is constitutionally incapable portraying anyone but ""Jamie Foxx."" When movie stars are having too much fun (my impression) the film suffers. As for Roland Emmerich THE PATRIOT REMAINS HIS BEST WORK. THIS WITHOUT WASTING MY TIME OR MY MONEY. Reply Miss Vinay Duggal says June 26 2013 at 826 am I cant wait to see it. Continued Successes to the Emmeriches Reply Joe says June 25 2013 at 1146 pm Not all movies are meant to be substantial. Some movies are just meant to be fun. Reply Spike says June 25 2013 at 1133 pm Wake up read The Wrap review and stop brown-nosing Sony. Will I see this picture after reading their review? Nope. Just like NOW YOU SEE ME (which I unfortunately wasted money on last night) a lot of sound and fury signifying NOTHING. Variety reviewers could you please expect more from a movie than guns and explosions and charismatic stars? That is NOT what movies are really about. Reply margie-rose dalton says June 25 2013 at 1033 pm I have been wanted to see this movie Cast I luv amp; cant wait till Friday Daughter is adorable. Reply Joe says June 25 2013 at 933 pm This will be the third movie Ive seen this year where Joey King appeeared. It seems a little strange to refer to her as a newcomer. Reply Nav Qateel says June 25 2013 at 1124 pm I was thinking the same thing. Reply B7 says June 26 2013 at 854 am totally agree...ive known her for a few years now... her name is not NEW to me.

TWITTER Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx join forces as the presidential residence comes under attack by paramilitary thugs in Roland Emmerichs latest action thriller. Time to call in the construction crew the decorators and the landscapers -- Roland Emmerich has trashed 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue again only this time he also chews up the lawn. A self-referential nod to Independence Day notwithstanding the directors derivative gaze in White House Down turns mainly toward the Die Hard franchise. He adds a little Air Force One patriotic peril some Lethal Weapon buddy banter and Homeland-style national security angst resulting in an action thriller that doesnt know when to quit. For the most part though it remains preposterously entertaining which should make it a sturdy entry in the early-summer popcorn stakes. The question hanging over this 150 million Sony release is to what extent itll be hurt by coming just three months after Antoine Fuquas similarly plotted Olympus Has Fallen became a surprise hit for FilmDistrict. Has the publics appetite for D.C. destruction been whetted or exhausted? In its corner Emmerichs film has a user-friendly PG-13 rating in place of the earlier releases R. It also trades up by swapping dour Gerard Butler for the simpatico pairing of Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx even if screenwriter James Vanderbilt (The Amazing Spider-Man) wavers in his commitment to teasing out the humor in their rapport. VIDEO White House Down Trailer Channing Tatums Secret Service Interview Goes Awry While black U.S. presidents have turned up onscreen before Foxxs James Sawyer is the closest yet to an Obama clone an association conveyed without much subtlety. A warm-hearted idealist his silken oratorical skills are on display whether charming his staffers or the American public in a televised address to push his proposed Middle East peace treaty. His most prized possession is an engraved pocket watch given by Mary Todd to Honest Abe which we know will come in handy at some point. However the cheers let out by an advance-screening audience when the Commander in Chief trades his executive brogues for hi-tops and his non-violent stance for some gun-toting whoop-ass give a clear indication of the Foxx persona that folks want to see. Emmerich and Vanderbilt can be commended for taking time to establish characters rather than hurtling into the melee which is generally required these days. Most of the early scenes are devoted to ex-Marine-turned-Capitol cop John Cale (Tatum). Assigned as security to House Speaker Eli Raphelson (Richard Jenkins) John has called in favors for an interview to get on the Presidents Secret Service detail. Thats partly to help the divorced dad reclaim the affections of his 11-year-old daughter Emily (Joey King) a major White House geek with her own D.C.-focused YouTube channel. (Really?) Johns glib manner doesnt help him in the interview nor does the fact that its conducted by Special Agent Carol Finnerty (Maggie Gyllenhaal) an old college flirt aware of his lousy track record on follow-through. The character is a carbon copy of Bruce Willis wisecracking John McClane right down to spending half the movie working up a sweat in a wife-beater. But its a snug fit for Tatum who strikes the right balance between everyman screw-up and quick-thinking fearless dynamo equally determined to rescue his daughter and protect the President. And with its secret underground passageways private chambers and antique-adorned public halls and offices the White House is a worthy successor to Nakatomi Plaza still the best of the Die Hard settings. STORY Will the Success of Olympus Has Fallen Hurt or Help White House Down? In the wrong place-wrong time tradition John after botching the Secret Service interview tags along with Emily on a White House tour. But when the kid slips away to the bathroom a bomb is detonated that brings down the Capitol dome leaving father and daughter separated as chaos ensues. At the same time a group of paramilitary thugs led by former Special Forces operative Emil Stenz (Jason Clarke) seizes the POTUS pad. This happens on the day that Secret Services chief Martin Walker (James Woods) is retiring embittered by the death of his son on active duty. The notion that in a post 9/11 world anyone could smuggle in a major explosive device tucked under floor-cleaning fluids is borderline ludicrous as is the heavy-duty weaponry packed by technicians who are supposedly upgrading the sound system in the Presidents private screening room. But then nobody was expecting documentary authenticity from Emmerich right? What the director lacks in finesse he makes up for in his wholehearted embrace of Hollywood cliche without the vulgarity or cynicism of say Michael Bay. Vanderbilt angles for a pass on the implausibility by giving the bad guys well-placed accomplices on the inside. But the script is both shamelessly formulaic and over-complicated as it plays on terrorism paranoia gung-ho patriotism blundering media and the demonization of defense contractors. While the movie wears out its welcome en route to a conclusion thats equal parts twisty and predictable the appealing leads camaraderie and virtually non-stop bullets-and-explosives action of the second half keep you watching. Foxx appears somewhat reined-in by the role at first but he loosens up nicely as the stakes get higher allowing his natural humor and physicality to surface by degrees. (His Jamie Foxx Show crush Garcelle Beauvais turns up briefly as the First Lady.) Tatum brings an effortless combination of self-irony and swagger that makes him a likable action hero. Even if the characters are strictly boilerplate (redneck neo-Nazis are so 90s) the cast of pros helps put them across. Gyllenhaal is a little soft to play hard-edged workaholic Carol but she provides useful testosterone relief. Woods distinctive brand of moral ambiguity is always welcome as is Jenkins dignified intelligence. Bristling with anger issues Clarke once again proves a strong presence and Lance Reddick vies for the title of Most Intense Man Alive as military brass General Caulfield. It seems almost quaint at this point not to be looking through 3D glasses at scenes with low-flying Black Hawk choppers barreling down the Mall target-locking missiles slicing the air or the presidential limo tearing up the turf in a chase scene played partly for laughs. But cinematographer Anna J. Foerster gives the movie a slick sheen and the CGI work is mostly sharp. The underscoring by Thomas Wander and Harald Kloser is wallpapered early on but works fine when the film kicks into suspense mode.

Photo Jamie Foxx left and Channing Tatum star in ""White House Down."" (AP) You couldnt ask for a more fun summer popcorn movie than ""White House Down."" The buddy action-comedy teams the ever-ingratiating Channing Tatum as a hunky off-duty DC cop with Jamie Foxx slyly amusing as President Sawyer a very thinly disguised version of our current chief executive. The latest epic from master of disaster Roland Emmerich is his most entertaining since ""Independence Day"" -- amusingly referenced by a White House tour guide in the new film which is a lot funnier than youd guess from some of the trailers. Tatums cop John Cale has snuck onto a tour with his precocious 12-year-old daughter Emily (the winning Joey King) after blowing an interview to join the presidential Secret Service detail. Cale gets a second chance to show his mettle when terrorists -- who have smuggled a truckload of explosives and weapons into the White House under the pretense of a sound upgrade for the screening room -- take the Lincoln-loving president hostage after instantly killing off all the agents charged with protecting him. Its a hoot when President Sawyer who very obviously lacks any military training tries to aim a rocket launcher at a vehicle full of bad guys on the South Lawn of the White House. And even funnier when the president puts on his glasses before firing an assault weapon at a baddie who has Cale pinned down in the kitchen. While Afghanistan War hero Cale and a fearful Sawyer are hiding in elevator shafts and trying to sneak out through an underground tunnel (were told JFK used it to smuggle Marilyn Monroe into the White House) Cales spunky daughter Emily is doing her own patriotic duty. RELATED WHY CHANNING TATUM IS THE NEW KING OF HOLLYWOOD Separated from her father she alerts the world to the White House home invasion by uploading video from her cellphone to YouTube provoking a full-blown constitutional crisis. The hawkish vice president (Michael Murphy) takes command and orders an attack on the White House where the terrorists are holding 60 hostages in addition to the president and demanding 500 million in cash. This preposterous scheme is being masterminded by the retiring veteran head of the Secret Service detail who is dying and seems to blame the president for his soldier sons death in the Middle East. Hes played with enormous relish by James Woods who not only chews scenery but practically inhales the Oval Office. Maggie Gyllenhaal is cast as Woods dumbstruck lieutenant who says things like ""I had Thanksgiving dinner at their home every year and unwisely brings in Woods wife to try and reason with her renegade husband. Richard Jenkins portrays the untrustworthy House Speaker who gets sworn in as president at one point and handed the nuclear launch codes. Tatum winningly plays the straight man in what amounts to the ""Airplane"" of political thrillers like this springs ""Olympus Has Fallen."" While theres more than a little of a ""Die Hard"" vibe here (more than in ""Die Hard 5"" actually) Emmerich and screenwriter James Vanderbilt wisely dont try to turn Tatum into a junior Bruce Willis. Its left to others to say things like ""The president is bombing the White House???"" while Tatum in a ripped shirt is busy trying to prevent the bad guys from shooting down Black Hawk helicopters from the White House roof or is setting fire to the Lincoln Bedroom to distract the terrorists. ""White House Down"" is the funniest thing Ive seen this year -- but possibly not quite as funny to those not amused by the idea of a liberal president taken hostage by a group of right-wing terrorists bent on turning over the reins of government to the military-industrial complex.
