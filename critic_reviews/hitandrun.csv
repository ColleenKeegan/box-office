Specific release dates and locations follow each review. REVIEWS THIS WEEK ""General Education"" ""Hit and Run"" ""Neighboring Sounds"" ""The Revenant"" ""Sleepwalk with Me"" ""Somewhere Between"" ""Teddy Bear"" ""General Education"" Director Tom Morris was born after John Hughes made his suburban teen comedies but he adopts a Hughesian view of high school for his feature debut ""General Education."" Promising tennis player Levi Collins (Chris Sheffield) chooses the court over a final presentation gaining an athletic scholarship to his fathers alma mater but flunking science. Levi opts not to tell his parents that he failed to graduate and attends summer school on the sly - all ten days of it. On a technical level ""General Education"" is an accomplished indie with crisp widescreen images and some standout performances (Janeane Garofalo immerses herself in quiet desperation as Levis neglected mom). What screenwriters Morris Elliot Feld and Jaz Kalkat fail to build is dramatic tension affable extremely self-involved Levi easily skates around all obstacles. Their most baffling decision is creating a barefoot black 13-year-old as Levis servile ""sidekick."" Precocious yet immature Charles (Skylan Brooks) seems poised to dive into the adolescent angst of Hughess marginalized teens leaving the bland entitled Levi in his wake. Criticwire grade C+ [Serena Donadoni] Opens Friday at Cinema Village in New York and available as VOD on iTunes. Released by Pelican House Productions. ""Hit and Run"" The freewheeling ""Hit amp; Run"" is a throwback to car chase movies of the 1970s when relationships were forged on the road. Charlie Bronson (Dax Shepard) decides to drive girlfriend Annie Bean (Kristen Bell) from central California to Los Angeles in his souped-up 1967 Lincoln Continental. (The film celebrates Detroit muscle both vintage and new.) Shes heading for a new future (an academic dream job) while hes transported into the past. Unbeknownst to Annie Charlies in the witness protection program and their romance hits a sizable speed bump when the hot rodder reveals his criminal history. Soon friends (Tom Arnolds needy accident-prone U.S. Marshall) and foes (Bradley Coopers vicious dreadlocked bank robber) are on their trail and ""Hit amp; Run"" zooms by like a screwball comedy version of Sam Peckinpahs ""The Getaway."" Shepard wrote the script and co-directed with David Palmer (""Brothers Justice"") constructing an ideal vehicle for the real-life couples spirited banter. Even when some of humor sputters Bell and Shepard are firing on all cylinders. Criticwire grade B+ [Serena Donadoni] Opened wide on Wednesday August 22. Released by Open Road Films. ""Neighboring Sounds"" Awarded the FIPRESCI prize after it premiered at Rotterdam Kleber Mendonca Filhos ""Neighbouring Sounds"" explores with acute circumspection a soon-to-be-gated community in the Brazilian town of Recife. When a private security firm arrives to offer its (dis)services in a middle class urban enclave the sinister spectres of suspicion and mistrust come forth. The director convincingly conveys an evasive social mosaic where any civic contact is a potential confrontation and even a love story raises a fastidious sense of scepticism. Housewives get off on domestic appliances; fear is the ultimate community enforcer as the household becomes a fortress of solitude to be defended from any external intrusion. Mendonca Filhos debut feature displays an uncommon ability in registering the equivocal nuances of paranoia and making them visible to the spectator. Its a psycho-surveillance thriller about the benign dystopia of gentrification and its crime-free ghettoes in which the middle class is imprisoning itself. Criticwire grade B+ [Celluloid Liberation Front] Opens Friday at IFC Center and the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center in New York. ""The Revenant"" Just because youre dead doesnt mean you cant go right on living. Take this bizarre green-vomit-filled horror-comedy by director Kerry Prior in which a United States soldier Bart (David Anders) is killed in an ambush in Iraq but rises from the dead back home in Los Angeles. Hes a vampire (technically a ""revenant"" which comes from a French word meaning ""to return"") and is able to function in society as long as he covers his colorless eyes with sunglasses and drinks lots of fresh human blood that he and his best pal (Chris Wylde) rob from lowlifes on the street. The blood also keeps Barts decaying body from stinking like hell and even allows him to get in some sack time with his financee. ""Revenant"" which was made in 2009 but is only now getting a theatrical release has sickly funny moments like a raid on a hospital blood bank and an encounter between a severed head and a dildo. But the story is familiar recalling ""Shaun of the Dead"" ""Fido"" and any number of other undead flicks. Bart is killed because he violated army rules and stopped to help a boy he thought had been injured. But the issue is immediately dropped and never developed botching the films one chance to do something different. Criticwire grade B [V.A. Musetto]. Opens Friday in New York with a national release to follow. Also available via VOD. Distributed by Lightning Entertainment. ""Sleepwalk with Me"" ""Sleepwalk With Me"" is based on writer-director Mike Birbiglias one-man show; on those terms the standup comedian-turned-filmmaker has made a respectable debut. With the help of producer and co-writer Ira Glass (NPRs ""This American Life"") Birbiglia chronicles his struggle to find work as an aspiring comedian while fending off mysterious somnambulistic tendencies. The movie has no distinctive style despite oodles of charm but Birbiglias perspective carries it along. Unlike many chatty comedians with a tendency to share their personal lives Birbiglia is the opposite of a narcissist with a tendency to sound mopey rather than aggressive. That passivity makes it hard to absorb the comedians problems without focusing on his pathetic nature. However his congeniality ultimately makes him an object of sympathy and thus a more reliable narrator than many comedians-turned-actors. The narrative is structured around a series would-be crises Birbiglia must overcome He wonders if he should marry his girlfriend or take a break to sleep with other people. This storytelling isnt particularly intriguing but Birbiglias charisma carries them with a personable brand of self-deprecation. That could make ""Sleepwalk With Me"" unbearable if it werent for Birbiglias sincere levelheaded voice and a sense of humor that truly comes to life during his inexplicable sleepwalking episodes. No matter how troublesome Birbiglias behavior gets hes never a burden which makes ""Sleepwalk With Me"" into the ideal advertisement for his live performances. Criticwire grade B+ [Eric Kohn] Originally reviewed on January 30 2012. Opens Friday in New York at IFC Center and in several cities beginning August 31st.  Distributed by IFC Films. ""Somewhere Between"" Chronicling the lives of four Chinese-born American-adopted teenage girls Linda Goldstein Knowltons doc Somewhere Between communicates something of the experience of dual nationality being fully Americanized but feeling the pull of your homeland. All abandoned by their birth parents because they werent born male the central quartet show off their U.S.-based lives which range from Berkeley privilege to Bible-Bet godliness. While the subjects successfully articulate their feeling of split identity - and one harrowingly recalls the vividly-remembered experience of being abandoned on the roadside - the film trades far too heavily in manufactured dramatic payoff. Thus one girls reunion with the family that abandoned her is played too much for tear-streaked (and surprisingly non-bitter) redemption while a young American couples decision to adopt a handicapped Chinese child is awash in overly triumphant bathos. Criticwire grade C+ [Andrew Schenker] Opens Friday in New York at IFC Center and in assorted cities beginning September 14th. ""Teddy Bear"" Theres nothing fresh about the premise of a grown single man living at home with his mother but Danish director Mads Matthiesens first feature ""Teddy Bear"" has a unique strategy for rejuvenating the formula. Its lead real-life bodybuilder Kim Kold is a hulking mass of biceps and bulging veins. Physically he dominates the room; emotionally hes a delicate flower. Matthiesen also the films screenwriter establishes Dennis world with a quiet gentle touch that relies less on dialogue -- since Dennis rarely has the courage to speak up -- than on the tension between the characters massive appearance and the world that constantly alienates him. The scenes where Dennis finally manages to find his groove are respectably bittersweet but they also hold back the material When it settles into the story of a budding relationship ""Teddy Bear"" strains from predictability and gets locked into a formulaic holding pattern. While Kolds distant gaze nicely conveys Dennis downbeat state his physicality becomes the movies true centerpiece. A gigantic physique hides the fragile man beneath and Matthiesen ably follows the journey of that persona as it tunnels through mounds of muscle to reach the surface. In essence the lion finds his courage. Criticwire grade B+ [Eric Kohn] Originally reviewed on January 22 2012. Opened in New York on Wednesday and opens in Miami on Friday. Distributed by Film Movement.

"Hit and Run | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Hit and Run Print Page Email Page Search Hit and Run (2012; Rated ) F "" The worst."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Hit and Run(2012; R)In theaters Wednesday 22 August 2012Genre Action Comedy RomanceCast Kristen Bell Bradley Cooper Dax Shepard New Richard Roeper reviews weekdays at 500 PM ET only on REELZCHANNEL (13) Post a Comment  lionuntersaid on Wednesday October 01 2014 21541 PMRichard Roeper might be my new favorite movie critic. This movie was so incredibly bad that it made me angry. I only watched half of it but everything about it was infuriating. He forgot to mention the part where they try to preach anti-homophobic stuff for absolutely no reason except to probably be more acceptable in hollywood. I hate this movie more than any movie every created including Birth of a Nation. Charlie said on Saturday September 20 2014 123334 AMI couldnt agree more except I give it a D instead of a F still a terrible unfunny movie mr roeper I respect your opinion Charliesaid on Saturday September 20 2014 123200 AMI couldnt agree more except an f is a little to harsh I hated this movie I would give it a D but I respect your opinion mr roeper xmarisolxsaid on Friday May 16 2014 40047 PMComplete overreation and Roger Ebert gave it 3 out of 4 stars if hat means anything. The story was tight with no loose ends each character served a purpose I found Charlie very likebale and the humor was actually very subtle. Not many one-liners or ""jokes"" just moments when you laugh at the situations or sight gags or the misunderstandings. Like when Charlie says he never told Annie he couldnt contact his family while under protection. Not a joke but so funny. I liked it. Not an Oscar contender but totally unworthy of this dismal review. jaredsaid on Sunday May 19 2013 123934 AMjust netflixed it.....I believe Roeper was right...if you liked it you must be a Dax fan..I dont have anything against him this was simply not a good movie. We get it you and Bell are a couple...I didnt want to be the 3rd wheel on your road trip Vera Waitresssaid on Sunday March 17 2013 125646 AMIt was hilarious. Johnsaid on Wednesday March 13 2013 103523 PMLuke I totally agree with what you said. It was a funny movie with some excellent dialogue. Critics who default to extremes are lazy. Brandon why be a hater. Its unbecoming. Brandonsaid on Tuesday December 25 2012 50557 PMLuke- Youre on a site full of movie reviews by a critic buddy. Every point you made is laughable considering that. Lukesaid on Monday September 10 2012 33951 PM""The worst""? Really? Why cant people just enjoy movies anymore? If its not spectacular it completely sucks like saying theres no middle ground. My wife amp; I happened to really like it we laughed a lot more than we both expected and we really enjoyed the chase scenes as well. Weve found that if most critics dont like it we still enjoy it and some where critics raved about it we cannot stand it. Why? Because tastes are different why listen to the rants from someone youve never met or have absolutely nothing in common with and find out for yourself. I personally cannot stand the new Fiat but I dont write reviews about them calling them the worst because I know its tailored to an audience Im not a member of. And Sara how can you call something a piece of crap without seeing it? You have zero grounds for judgement. Nedsaid on Tuesday September 04 2012 101354 AMSara - I would agree with you on Tom Arnold but I was surprised at how funny he was in this. It is no groundbreaker but it funnier than anything Ive seen Will Ferrell do. Like ever.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 24 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Aug. 23 2012 554PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Dax Shepard and David Palmer Written by Dax Shepard Starring Dax Shepard Kristen Bell Bradley Cooper Classification 14A Genre comedy Year 2012 Country USA Language English Its a rom-com its a road movie its Cars without the animation its A History of Violence played for yuks. Its all that and less because really Hit amp; Run is awfully hit amp; miss. The hits a beguiling lead performance from writer/co-director/busy-guy Dax Shepard along with some flashy streaks of clever dialogue - self-consciously clever to be sure but whos complaining. The misses Tom Arnold more Tom Arnold a traffic-snarl of a plot and not one but two scenes of full-frontal nudity involving very old folks divested of their clothes yet not apparently of their libidos. No doubt in our aging demographic sex among the geriatric set is laudable even applaudable. Filmable however is another matter entirely. Watch Hit and Run the official trailer Kristen Bell attends the premiere of Hit and Run at Regal Cinemas in Los Angeles Calif. August 14 2012. Reuters video Video Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell pull a Hit amp; Run Speaking of make-out sessions the opening frames drop in on Annie and Charlie enjoying a post-coital chat on a bright summers morn. They seem at first blush quite the odd couple. She (Kristen Bell) is a pert blonde sociology prof teaching in the outer groves of academe. He (Shepard) looks to be her latest soc experiment - a decade older tattooed unkempt and often unemployed. Clearly though the two are magic in bed and not so bad beyond either. They coo they snuggle they call each other ""Buddy"" that most ubiquitous of modern endearments. (Have you noticed how todays tykes are all dubbed Buddy by todays parents?)On the subject of names Charlies last one is Bronson although rest assured that its a pseudonym and more meta than you think ""I actually named myself after the famous British prisoner who named himself after Charles Bronson."" Such a relief but why the need for a new moniker? Well unknown to innocent Annie hes in the Witness Protection Program and his federal protector is the ever annoying Arnold an uber-nincompoop whom we first meet in all his klutzy glory - forgetting to put his vehicle in park chasing said vehicle as it rolls away yelling ""Halt"" shooting the miscreant with his trusty sidearm. Expect more of the same later.Before that happy moment arrives the rom-com morphs into a road flick when Annie gets a job offer way off in California. For transportation Charlie dusts off his customized 700-horsepower Lincoln even as the script dusts off his past - he used to be the wheel-man for bank robbers. Yes the guy has enemies among them his ex-partner in crime Alex (Bradley Cooper) not to mention Annies ex-partner in domesticity Gil (Michael Rosenbaum). Whats more his enemies also have high-octane automobiles - for the former a super-charged Audi; for the latter some sports convertible whose make I failed to discern but you know its fast. Pretty soon out on the two-lane blacktop darned if the cars arent heavily invested in car-chases - a rare sight on the silver screen.Fortunately the chases are sporadically interrupted for chatter the aforementioned clever brand. Thats when A History of Violence gets mined for laughs. Sometimes Charlie and Annie debate the character-is-destiny argument wondering if the human animal can truly change its stripes. Other times less existentially they muse upon the question of whether a homophobic slur may ever be used innocuously as a playful figure of speech. Kudos both sides make a strong case. Finally at still other times our chatterboxes mistakenly open the wrong motel door to reveal ... yep a quartet of naked oldsters in mid-swing. Sorry expect more of that too.Nevertheless give Shepard credit for redeeming his writerly failures with a performing success. Theres a bit of Owen Wilson in his manner and he channels it to give this erstwhile redneck character a more sociable hue. The hat is off-white the heart is near-gold and the lingo is amusingly purple. Charlie is a hit. Otherwise run.

Burt Reynolds and Sally Field theyre not but you could do worse for mindless late-summer entertainment than Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell in ""Hit amp; Run a lowbudget R-rated update on the kind of car-chase romantic comedies that filled drive-ins four decades ago. Shepard star of TVs ""Parenthood wrote the credulity-straining but occasionally hilarious script co-directed (with David Palmer) and plays the amusingly named Charlie Bronson. Charlie -- real name Yul -- has been hiding out under his assumed name for four years in a small California town under the Witness Protection Program after testifying against his collaborators in a bank robbery. Charlies girlfriend Annie (Bell Shepards fiancee in real life) a sociology professor at a local community college gets an offer for a dream job running an anger-management program. So Charlie impulsively decides to drive her to the interview in Los Angeles -- the scene of his crime -- in his souped-up 1967 Lincoln Continental. Its not a great idea of course. Particularly after Alex (Bradley Cooper in unbecoming dreadlocks) the psychopath who Charlie double-crossed is provided with Charlie and Annies itinerary by her jealous and idiotic ex (Michael Rosenbaum) who decides to trail them himself for good measure. Also joining in the chase is a bumbling federal marshal (a slapstick-y Tom Arnold) assigned to watch Charlie exiled to the hinterlands because of his unfortunate tendency to lose control of his vehicle and accidentally discharge his firearm. There are also glorified cameos by Kristin Chenoweth (as Bells pill-popping boss); Joy Bryant (Shepards ""Parenthood"" co-star) as Alexs beautiful girlfriend and Charlies ex; and Beau Bridges as Charlies pugnacious dad. Anyone expecting ""Smokey and the Bandit""-caliber chases will be disappointed -- even with Charlies background as a former stock-car driver Shepard and Palmer just dont do anything terribly exciting with the films vehicles drawn mostly from Shepards personal collection. Better are the scenes of Annie arguing with Charlie -- who has been less than honest with her about his past -- thanks to genuine on-screen chemistry between Shepard and Bell (not always a given where real-life couples are concerned). Like many contemporary comedies ""Hit amp; Run"" has an obsession with homosexuality and male rape. Annies ex has a gay state-trooper brother whos more interested in searching for hookups with a cellphone app while on duty than finding Charlie. The movies arguably funniest if least politically correct sequence comes when Alex reveals hes been assaulted in prison -- and motormouthed Charlie keeps asking him about the ethnicity of the rapist. Its impossible to believe either Shepard or Cooper as a criminal but they certainly know comic repartee.

Starring Bradley Cooper Kristen Bell Kristin Chenoweth Dax Shepard Michael Rosenbaum Beau Bridges Joy Bryant Tom Arnold Director David Palmer Dax Shepard Release Opened Aug 24 2012  Editorial Review Romantic drive to a dead endBy Stephanie MerryFriday August 24 2012""Hit and Run"" might be a middling romantic comedy if it werent for those pesky chase scenes. Or it could be a decent action movie if only the engine-revving werent derailed by the intermittent saccharine schmoopiness. Instead it feels like writer co-director and star Dax Shepard has unleashed some kind of freakish Franken-film on movie-goers. Mixing up incongruous elements can work of course; theres a reason peanut butter and jelly are a lunchtime staple. But ""Hit and Run"" feels so lazily thrown together. Its as if Shepard stumbled over to the fridge to concoct a breakfast smoothie and just grabbed whatever was closest to the door. Peaches pickles milk and mayonnaise? Toss it all in the blender. Shepard plays Charlie Bronson a bedraggled drawling man under witness protection who lives in the middle of nowhere with his professor girlfriend Annie (real-life fiance Kristen Bell). While Annie has no ambitions for a better job as that would mean leaving her marooned boyfriend her boss insists she interview for a dream position in Los Angeles. The only kink is that L.A. is the hometown of the criminals who have it out for Charlie. But devoted boyfriend that he is Charlie breaks out his souped-up Lincoln Continental and chauffeurs his girlfriend to her interview and toward a potentially life-threatening scenario. Hot on their heels are Randy (Tom Arnold) -- the trigger-happy numskull charged with protecting Charlie -- and Annies vengeful ex Gil played by Michael Rosenbaum. Also entering the mix are the bank robbers Charlie has been evading for four years including Alex (a dreadlocked Bradley Cooper) and Neve (Joy Bryant). In terms of humor the punchlines often feel either uninspired or downright distasteful. On the less offensive end of the spectrum the gags include an orgy with what appears to be octogenarians and a sweaty bumbling coffee-stained Tom Arnold. Some editor should have stepped in however when jokes about prison rape popped up in the script. And a sight gag in which a couple of small children are endangered of being hit by either a runaway minivan or haphazardly shot bullets seems like a non-starter. The chemistry between Shepard and Bell should have been a snap given that the pair are actually together. But their scenes were some of the most problematic. With the exception of a rather sweet introduction in which Charlie gives Annie an early morning pep talk in preparation for a big day the couples repartee consists of putting each other down (Charlie often jokes that Annie is fat and ugly) mindless and sentimental compliments or twitch-inducing whining about how one betrayed the other. Theres no wit and no passion and certainly no indication that the relationship can survive outside the vacuum of Nowhere U.S.A. There are a few inspired bits including one slow-motion sequence in which Charlie revs his engine flaunting his cars full power to a slowed-down version of the song ""Pure Imagination"" from 1971s ""Willy Wonka amp; the Chocolate Factory."" Meanwhile Jess Rowland who practically steals the show as a gay police officer schooling his partner on the finer points of a Grindr-like app could teach the rest of the players a thing or two about comic timing. Then again theres only so much an actor can do with lifeless dialogue. Its hard to blame the cast for looking less than committed; they all realized too late that Shepard created a monster.Contains nudity violence and crude language.

But in the case of Dax Shepard and David Palmers marvelous road-trip comedy Hit and Run maybe not. The key to the picture isnt so much the what as the how Instead of handing over every joke right on the beat Hit and Run lures you in with its jackalope rhythms. Theres nothing else like it on the current landscape. Shepard plays Charlie Bronson a regular dude -- or so it seems -- whos somehow landed himself in witness protection. The one saving grace in his small-town exile -- aside from the chance to give himself a name cooler than the one he was given at birth -- is his girlfriend Annie (Kristen Bell) who teaches at a local two-bit community college. Her dream is to someday use her doctorate in conflict resolution pretty hard to do in a tiny town. Miraculously she gets her chance. (To give you an idea of the movies gloriously whacked-out worldview Kristin Chenoweth plays the fairy godmother who makes it so.) The catch is that shell have to move to Los Angeles and Charlie -- who needs to remain under the cockeyed protection of the U.S. marshal whos been assigned to him played by a shambling and very funny Tom Arnold -- cant follow her there. But after a bitter argument he decides Annies love is worth the risk. And so he tosses everything shell need for her L.A. sojourn -- in a silly-wonderful blast of movie logic it all fits in a duffel bag and a little train case -- into the trunk of a souped-up 67 Lincoln and the two take off for a new life. This is a romance after all and Charlie figures hell deal with any complications that arise. As it turns out the biggest one is played by Bradley Cooper in yellow-tinted aviators and deeply unflattering dirty-blond dreadlocks -- and giving his best performance ever as a bank robber whom Charlie sold down the river years before. Shepard wrote Hit and Run himself possibly as a way of giving Bell (his partner in real life) a role worthy of the quicksilver gifts she brought to televisions Veronica Mars. He pulls it off. Bell and Shepard are lovely together whether their characters are squaring off or turtledoving. As Annie Bell is luminous and just a little loopy in a 30s-comedy way. Shepards Charlie looks and talks like a dumb lug but its simply that hes got the kind of intelligence that needs to be teased out of him and Shepard plays that deftly. i Former getaway driver Charlie Bronson (Dax Shepard) is just trying to get his girlfriend Annie (Kristen Bell) to L.A. but his guardians in the Witness Protection Program as well as his ex-associates dont want him to go. Open Road Films hide caption toggle caption Open Road Films Former getaway driver Charlie Bronson (Dax Shepard) is just trying to get his girlfriend Annie (Kristen Bell) to L.A. but his guardians in the Witness Protection Program as well as his ex-associates dont want him to go. Open Road Films Charlie keeps Annie calm when she heads into a tailspin and she helps smooth over some of his rougher edges lecturing him on the reasons he shouldnt use the anti-gay f-word as a synonym for ""lame."" (Shes right and he knows it.) As a bonus Hit and Run -- which shows clear affection for 70s exploitation pictures like Dirty Mary Crazy Larry and Eat My Dust -- features more and better stunt driving than even the great (though perhaps not accurately named) Drive did. Some of it doesnt exactly qualify as driving Arnolds character loses control of the minivan hes driving not once not twice but more than three times. Why should this become funnier each time it happens? You comedy theorists may know the answer but please keep it to yourselves. Arguably these days its easier to make a successful comedy than it is to make a romance. Miraculously Hit and Run works as both. The pictures finest and perhaps most delicate moment arrives late in the game after Charlie and Annie have survived many small arguments and some pretty big ones. Strapped into their car with those race-car driver harnesses they lean in for a kiss only to realize that the tightly buckled contraptions prevent them from reaching each other. No matter -- they drive off putting the kiss on hold. Just because we dont see it doesnt mean its not inevitable. True love demands a strong constitution and an even stronger seat belt.

Comments Hit and Run Video Rated R  100 minutes  2012 In this flaccid action comedy a former getaway driver (Dax Shepard) ditches his witness protection program to drive his girlfriend (Kristen Bell) to LA for a job interview and they get chased by bad guys along the way. Much of the dialogue sounds unscripted but not in a good way; during the longer scenes the actors often seem to be grasping for ideas. This is neither funny nor suspenseful but it does feature some cool-looking cars and Tom Arnold delivers some decent pratfalls as an accident-prone man. Shepard wrote the script and codirected with David Palmer.

"Hit and Run (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Hit and Run (R) The charisma between real-life sweethearts Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell carries this road comedy. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com8/23/2012 Editor rating 2.5 Everyone in Hit and Run is clearly having a good time. Its the audience that gets left out of the fun. This hybrid of rom-coms and road pictures is at its best when it focuses on real-life fiances Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell who play a crazy-in-love couple living in a small California town mostly enjoying each others company. Shepard who wrote the screenplay gives their characters -- Charlie and Annie -- lots of funny things to do and say and for once the banter doesnt sound cutesy or fake. Their playful pillow talk is genuinely endearing no doubt based at least in part on the actors real-life relationship. Then Annie gets a job offer in L.A. which forces Charlie to reveal a secret Hes been living under an alias as part of the Witness Protection Program after testifying on a band of bank robbers he used to run with and hes not legally allowed to leave town. Annie is understandably confounded by this revelation. Some ""Who are you?"" confrontations ensue. But the movie nimbly skips over the hand-wringing wisely sensing the audience doesnt really care much about this stuff. The couple decides Annies job offer is worth the risk and they go on the run in the 700-horsepower 1967 Lincoln Charlie has kept hidden in their garage all the time theyve been living together. These kinds of contrivances would derail a lesser movie (she really never noticed that enormous car before?). But Hit and Run which was co-directed by Shepard and David Palmer never takes itself too seriously so you dont have to either. As is the norm for the road-movie genre Charlies former cohorts (led by Bradley Cooper) give chase looking to give the stool pigeon some payback. Tom Arnold as a bumbling U.S. marshal assigned to keep tabs on Charlie also joins the pursuit but hes such a klutz he keeps losing control of his car and his gun. The car chases are nothing special -- mostly they consist of Charlie outmaneuvering the bad guys in parking lots and airplane hangars -- and there is absolutely no doubt ever where the story is going to end up. But Shepard and Bell are immensely likable together They have a natural ease and rapport that serves the movie well and youre happy to watch them work out their differences at 100 mph. Hit and Run isnt very memorable and it isnt all that exciting but its occasionally funny and sweet and more engaging than any action-comedy Jennifer Aniston has made in her entire career. In the dog days of August thats practically a rave. Cast Dax Shepard Kristen Bell Bradley Cooper Tom Arnold Kristin Chenoweth. Directors David Palmer Dax Shepard. Screenwriter Dax Shepard.

"Hit amp; Run review Road-worthy rom-com | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesHit amp; Run review Road-worthy rom-comDax Shepard who wrote co-directed co-produced and stars in Hit amp; Run has produced a sweet and charming road movie.Real-life couple Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard star in Hit amp; Run.  (Jeffrey Reed / Open Road Films)  By Bruce DeMaraThu. Aug. 23 2012Hit and Run (out of 4)Starring Dax Shepard Kristen Bell. Written and co-directed by Dax Shepard. 100 minutes. Opens Aug. 24 at major theatres. 14ALike the classic 1967 Cadillac that transports our protagonists for much of the journey Hit amp; Run is a road-worthy romance-comedy.Lets extend the metaphor further. Dax Shepard who wrote co-directs co-produces and stars proves himself a more than able navigator throughout this 700-horsepower ride with foot planted confidently on the pedal throughout.Article Continued BelowThe story opens with some leisurely pillow talk between Charlie and Annie (engagingly played by Shepard and Kristen Bell a real-life couple off-screen) establishing the relationship central to the film and one thats about to be tested.Charlie a long-haired tattooed dude is a contrast to Annie whose blond wholesome good looks suggest former head cheerleader. Shes also much more the go-getter raring to head off to Los Angeles to interview for a dream job in her chosen field of crisis management.Hed much prefer to stay in the sleepy California town where hes been hiding out for the past four years in the witness protection program but for Annie hes willing to break out of his comfortable exile even if theres a danger of running into the old partners in crime he once testified against.When Annies bitter ex Gil uncovers Charlies shady past as a getaway driver and rats him out to former best bud Dimitri (a dreadlocked Bradley Cooper) the chase is on with Charlies federal marshal protector Randy and a ginger-haired sheriff joining the fray.While the film is firmly rooted in the present -- gay Sheriff Terry uses a mobile app for highway ""cruising"" and the amusing back-and-forth between Charlie and Annie is often hilariously PC -- Shepard also pays gentle homage to the past sprinkling snatches of old pop-rock tunes like ""Knocking on Heavens Door"" and ""Let My Love Open the Door"" throughout not to mention the vintage wheels.Hit amp; Run has a contemporary sense of humour with its colourful lexicon of curse words and theres a scene of aging kinksters in a motel room -- featuring a flash of full frontal -- that is bawdy fun.But perhaps harkening back to a gentler time Shepard never lets a sense of dire danger overwhelm the story. Even Coopers heavy Dimitri aint all that heavy. Rather its measured and mostly merry chase that keeps the focus on witty dialogue low-tech pratfalls idiosyncratic characters and most importantly the evolving relationship between Charlie and Annie which unfolds in a believable and appealing manner.If theres one road apple along the way its Tom Arnolds portrayal of Randy whose sweaty excess bombast amidst a host of more textured performances throws his scenes off-balance.Among the supporting cast Kristin Chenoweth makes the most of her scant screen time as Annies Xanax-pushing career mentor comic David Koechner is briefly a hoot as a sleazy garage mechanic the couple meet to their detriment along the way and hey theres Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes pitching in on cameo roles that remind us that less is often more. (Hear that Tom?)Alternately edgy and sweet fast but never furious and anchored by a strong script and a solid cast (save one) Hit amp; Run is a road trip movie thats worth the drive.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Dax Shepards Hit amp; Run delivers hits some misses - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Dax Shepards Hit amp; Run delivers hits some misses Share Tweet Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell in the 2012 film ""Hit and Run"" directed by David Palmer and Dax Shepard. (Jeffrey Reed/Open Road Films)Jeffrey Reed/Open Road Films Share Tweet By Mark Feeney Globe Staff | 08.22.12 | 358 PM Annie (Kristen Bell) and Charlie (Dax Shepard) have been together for a year. They live in a nowhere town 500 miles from Los Angeles. ""Hit amp; Run"" opens with them talking in bed. Hes reassuring her about a meeting shes supposed to have soon with her boss. The scene is sweet and charming and feels as close to a real matter-of-fact romantic relationship as the movies have seen this summer. This is impressive in and of itself. Considering how many f-bombs and car chases the rest of ""Hit amp; Run"" will have its astounding. Related Link Find theaters and showtimes The good news is that Annies boss wants to tell her about a job in LA. The bad news is that Charlies last name is Bronson. Thats not his real name obviously. Its one hes assumed because hes in a witness-protection program -- and the bad guys hes being protected from are in (yup) LA. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ""Hit amp; Run"" now turns into a road movie with LA as destination. This is where the f-bombs and car chases come in. Some of this road movie is smart and intentionally funny some of it is coarse and unintentionally not funny at all. Theres a long bit involving dog food for example thats so off it makes you wonder about Shepards judgment. He wrote the script as well as co-directed with David Palmer. The balance among romance comedy action and raunch keeps fluctuating. When Shepards on though hes really on. Theres hardly anything rote or predictable about ""Hit amp; Run"" other than its title. Thats true of Shepards screen presence too. Hes Owen Wilson with a Billy Bob Thornton streak. That doesnt sound like such a good idea like a sloe gin fizz chased with RC Cola. But it works. Shepards chemistry with Bell carries the picture. The rest of the cast does fine. Bradley Cooper as one of the bank robbers Charlies trying to avoid shows up in dreadlocks and amber-tinted aviators. You can sense what a good time hes having. Hes like Colin Farrell in ""Horrible Bosses"" big star as bad guy with very bad hair. Tom Arnold as the worlds most inept US marshal gets more than his share of laughs. The biggest scene-stealer in ""Hit amp; Run"" is the black 67 Lincoln Continental (with 700 horsepower) Charlie brings out from under wraps in the garage so he can drive Annie to LA. Its what the Batmobile would be if the Batmobile were vintage and not custom-made. Put Christian Bale behind the wheel and ""Hit amp; Run"" would make a billion bucks -- except then thered be no room for Shepard and that movie would hardly be worth watching.

Hit and Run Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2012) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hit-and-run-2012,200,hitandrun12,hitandrun,rogerebert
"Hit and Run Review by Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Hit amp; Run Retro plot takes wrong turn  1/2 Hit amp; Run Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard star in ""Hit amp; Run."" Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard star in ""Hit amp; Run."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In adolescence many of us were cinematically weaned on (or permanently stunted by; Ill let the courts decide) the likes of ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"" and ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"" rough-edged and disreputable time-killers whose co-stars were whatever the lead characters were driving.""Hit amp; Run"" is a throwback to such films in addition to ripping off the late Tony Scotts ""True Romance"" in its fairy tale love and persistent brutality. Screenwriter co-director (with David Palmer) and co-star Dax Shepard has acknowledged as inspirations such vehicular-based hits as ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""The Cannonball Run."" Stripped to its essence the car chase when done right remains one of the mediums great glories of figurative and literal escapism and its a stern test of a filmmakers priorities and willingness or unwillingness to cheat. To wit When Quentin Tarantino made ""Death Proof"" the often-dazzling highlight of ""Grindhouse"" he took care to let the stunts and the action look and feel legit -- not the physics-defying result of the usual digital effects but old school in the most bracing way.Although Shepard clearly is a huge muscle-car enthusiast and although the ""Parenthood"" TV series ensemble member has his fans ""Hit amp; Run"" is pretty rancid as comedy. Worse the chases are strictly amateur hour all shortcut editing and no gut satisfaction. Shepard plays Charlie Bronson a reformed robbery getaway driver living in a small hot central California town with his educator girlfriend played by Kristen Bell Shepards real-life fiancee. Annie doesnt know about Charlies past only that he has one. Charlies accident-prone Witness Protection Program overseer (Tom Arnold in a strained unfunny turn) is easy to shake once Charlie and Annie hit the road in order to get Annie to LA for a job. But theyre pursued by Annies ex and Charlies former snakelike cohorts -- Bradley Cooper plays the chief snake in dreadlocks -- who have scores to settle with their driver.The script takes its central relationship seriously which leads to an unusual number of soul-searching conversations and which mitigates to some degree the general wash of wisecracks regarding all sorts of rape. Shepard wants it both ways His character is meant to be a sweet lunkhead who uses words such as ""fag"" and insults Asians but by movies end hes learned his lesson and is deserving of his woman. Like the ""Hangover"" films ""Hit amp; Run"" trades in a very violent brand of comedy that sells. I dont buy it; its not slapstick its just viciousness. Theres a set piece in which Coopers character humiliates and wallops a menacing African-American stranger and it threw me straight out of the movie.That scenes played for laughs of course. But even with its retro vibe ""Hit amp; Run"" is merely the latest picture more modestly scaled than most to give the catch-all notion of the B movie a bad name deserving of a new category the D movie.mjphillipstribune.com Hit amp; Run -- 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for pervasive language including sexual references graphic nudity some violence and drug content)Running time 135Opens Wednesday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Bradley Cooper Dax Shepard 10 movies to see this summer Expendables 2 Meep-meep Ka-pow  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0820-hit-and-run-20120822,0,805925.column",200,hitandrun13,hitandrun,chicagotribune

In Hit amp; Run which he wrote and codirected (with David Palmer) he plays a retired crook named Charlie Bronson (a fake name chosen when the character ditched L.A. to enter Witness Protection). Squirreled away in a pastoral small town Charlie got involved with Annie (Kristen Bell) a college professor who adores him -- but is also terrified by the fact that she knows next to nothing about him. Looking at Shepard who has the lopsided grin of a happy-talk used-car salesman offset by very serious eyes that perpetually study whomever hes babbling to we know just how she feels. When Annie lands a job interview Charlie agrees to drive her to L.A. in his souped-up death-black 1967 Lincoln Continental a road odyssey that lures out all the colorful underworld vermin whove been waiting for him to emerge from the woodwork. Hit amp; Run is filled with pop-up-book hooligans who cant stop talking Bradley Cooper (underacting nicely) as a dreadlocked sociopath Tom Arnold (overacting loudly) as a gay U.S. marshal so closeted hes about to explode. The dialogue veers into digressions about ADHD the cruddiness of mainstream dog food and much else. That these asides prove more fun than the central action is what gives Hit amp; Run its flavor tasty at times even if the film evaporates as you watch it.

Like someone was willing to bankroll the wish of Hollywood couple Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell to work together on a film. They just werent willing to sink a whole lot of money into it. Thats not to say this shoestring cross between one of Burt Reynolds old muscle-car movies and the blue satire of Reno 911 is without its charm and its laughs. Its just that if Shepard hadnt been able to coax friends like Bradley Cooper into participating Hit amp; Run would be opening on PPV. Bell (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) is a brilliant academic - stop laughing we havent gotten to the jokes yet - stuck at a supremely undistinguished school. She gets a great offer in L.A. but her boyfriend Shepard (Employee of the Month) is inexplicably unwilling to leave their no-horse town. The reason for his reluctance becomes obvious as soon as he busts his hot-rod Lincoln out of the shed and determines to drive her. It quickly turns into a Gumball Rally as they are chased by Bells clingy ex-boyfriend (Smallvilles Michael Rosenbaum) a fumble-fingered federal marshal (Tom Arnold) a gay highway patrolman (Jess Rowland) on the prowl and a vicious gang of bank robbers (lead by Bradley Cooper in a ratty-dred wig). There are a number of supporting roles and cameos for actors like Kristin Chenoweth David Koechner Beau Bridges Jason Bateman and Sean Hayes. Shepard gets to act opposite his real girlfriend (Bell) and his TV girlfriend (Parenthoods Joy Bryant). Every person in the movie has a quirky character note that keeps gags within easy reach at all times. The problem is that Hit amp; Run cant really settle on a tone. Its a goofy caper that turns savage. The comedy is light but appealing. The action scenes directed by David Palmer and Shepard are dreadful. The car chases all seem to happen on back roads and in industrial parking lots. What the budget wouldnt cover going out in traffic? You know a film is thin when you find yourself focusing on the score in this case a choice jukebox from vintage Lou Rawls to classic Jimi Hendrix. Hit amp; Run is a pleasant enough diversion - but more of the PPV persuasion. Hit amp; Run 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by David Palmer and Dax Shepard. With Kristen Bell Shepard Bradley Cooper and Tom Arnold. Distributed by Open Road Films. Running time 1 hour 39 mins.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The last couple of decades havent been great for medium-sized movies. As production and distribution costs have risen films have been pushed to one of two categories dollar-menu or super-sized. Moviegoers have their choice of blown-out spectacles and tiny wonders in abundance but more modestly scaled films--be they relationship dramas or madcap comedies--have become endangered species. In that respect Hit amp; Run--a film starring written and co-directed (with David Palmer) by Dax Shepard--is a noble throwback. A cross-country car-chase comedy that would probably make Hal Needham nod in recognition its low on ambition but made with a lot of personality and aims to offer as many broad laughs and shorn tire treads as its limited budget will allow. And in the space left over it tries to squeeze in a little heart. If only it accomplished everything it set out to do it would be a model for anyone looking to revive the sort of genre fare that kept drive-ins in business. Making the most of his low-key charisma Shepard plays a car enthusiast living in the middle of nowhere as part of the witness-protection program after testifying against his best friend (Bradley Cooper sporting blond dreadlocks) in the wake of a botched robbery. Life in exile isnt so bad however Hes become friends with the bumbling marshal in charge of keeping him safe (Tom Arnold) and picked up a devoted girlfriend in the form of Kristen Bell (Shepards real-life partner) an overachieving sociology professor specializing in non-violent conflict resolution. All is going well enough until Bell gets the call to interview for her dream job in Los Angeles the one place Shepard really should not go. But love trumps safety and the couple soon strike out for the West Coast in Shepards tricked-out 67 Lincoln Continental with Bells jealous ex-boyfriend (Michael Rosenbaum) and Arnold both in pursuit. High-speed antics and spirited conversation follow with one having the edge on the other. Though Shepard and Palmer clearly have a lot of fondness for old-style car stunts only a few moments suggest they have the chops to match the films that inspired them. Its fun for a while to watch the film contrive to get Bell and Shepard into different sorts of vehicles and race around different types of settings but the actual payoff to those contrivances isnt all that thrilling. And as the bad guy Cooper doesnt really inspire much of a sense of danger in spite of the films best efforts to badass him up. But as the star and writer Shepard comes off well generating sparky chemistry with Bell and zigzagging the dialogue in unexpected directions like an extended argument in which Bell counters every defense he offers for throwing around the word ""fag."" However the long stretches between moments like that when the action plods along as the film moves from point A to point Z keep Hit amp; Run from transcending agreeability and becoming memorable. There really ought to be a lot more movies like Hit amp; Run but only if theyre just a little bit better.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A former criminal leaves witness protection to prove his love to a girl. BOTTOM LINE Even for an action comedy this is awfully fluffy with mild chase scenes punctuated by pleasant banter between real-life sweethearts Shepard and Bell. CAST Dax Shepard Kristen Bell Bradley Cooper Tom Arnold LENGTH 135 A cute friendly little movie made by a little group of cute friends ""Hit amp; Run"" stars real-life couple Dax Shepard (NBCs ""Parenthood"") and Kristen Bell as an ex-criminal and his girlfriend. Shepard who wrote and codirected with David Palmer (they collaborated on 2010s ""Brothers Justice"") also cast actors from his social circle including Bradley Cooper and Tom Arnold. Theyre all clearly having fun though thats not the same as making a movie. Shepard plays small-town slacker Charlie Bronson -- thats his witness protection moniker -- whose girlfriend Annie Bean (Bell) assumes he testified against mobsters. In fact Charlie was a getaway driver who betrayed his bank-robbing partner Alex Dmitri (Cooper). When Annie gets an important job interview in nearby Los Angeles Charlie decides to leave his safety zone and drive there with her.

Chasing the cute couple across California are various goofballs and bad guys Annies ex-boyfriend (Michael Rosenbaum) a U.S. marshal (Arnold) two local sheriffs (one played by Carly Hatter Shepards half-sister) and Alexs menacing gang. All promising enough for a romp but the ensembles overly cozy camaraderie seeps into the entire film. The banter is cheerful and friendly no matter whos holding the gun; Charlie and Alex ostensibly bitter enemies seem ready to embrace any second. And for all the car chases and parking-lot doughnuts that black Lincoln barely gets a scratch. (It too belongs to Shepard a hot-rod aficionado and sometime racer). ""Hit amp; Run"" is a pleasant forgettable diversion though its cast and crew probably took home the best memories. 158 NewsHit amp; Run premiere PLOT A former criminal leaves witness protection to prove his love to a girl.

"Hit amp; Run a contender in summers guilty pleasure race Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Hit amp; Run a contender in summers guilty pleasure raceThe comedy and chemistry mix well in Dax Shepards car-chase caper Hit amp; Run which occasionally veers off track but gets back on course with a talented cast.August 21 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard hit the road in the romantic action comedy ""Hit... (Jeffrey Reed / Open Road...)""Hit amp; Run"" the low-budget lowbrow car chase comedy starring Dax Shepard Kristen Bell Bradley Cooper and Tom Arnold is a strange but strangely entertaining combo of drag racing machismo slapstick silliness raunchy riffs politically incorrect rants and sweet nothings.Revving up its R-rated engines then detouring for relationship repairs the sincere and the absurd work in fits and starts. Though ""Hit amp; Run"" isnt consistent enough to put it in the league with car chase/rocky relationship classics like Robert De Niro and Charles Grodins ""Midnight Run"" its certainly a contender in this summers guilty pleasure race.Shepard co-directed with David Palmer and wrote the story in which he plays a former bank robbery getaway driver now living in small-town safety under the witness protection plan and an assumed name a Charlie Bronson. Life is sunshine and lollipops until new girlfriend Annie (Bell who is Shepards real-life fiancA(c)e) has a shot at her dream job at a major university. The only downside is that it would require going back to the scene of his crimes in this case Los Angeles.Driving Annie there would be risky regardless. But Charlies decided to take the old getaway car out of mothballs a 1967 souped-up Lincoln (one of Shepards real cars; theres a pattern emerging). It makes flying under the radar much harder and is only one of many complications that will beset the couple. Indeed their relationship is threatened at every turn as cars are mangled the truth is twisted and Charlies dark secrets get spilled.Helping mix things up are a series of comic sideshows most of them conducted by Shepards circle of friends or at least those willing to work for scale. Randy (Tom Arnold huffing and puffing delightfully) is Charlies federal marshal minder. More baby than babysitter hes a gun-dropping doofus who is especially dangerous when hes behind the wheel which in this movie is a lot.But the serious trouble starts when Annies pecs-flexing ex (Michael Rosenbaum) Facebook-friends the guy Charlie doubled-crossed. That would be Alex Demitri (Cooper) who swings wildly between sensitive and brutally insane his bleached-out dreadlocks helping diminish the usually suave power of Peoples sexiest man alive.Meanwhile Shepard just keeps piling on more bodies. Joy Bryant who plays Shepards wife in the TV drama ""Parenthood"" turns up as Alexs girlfriend. Charlies estranged dad (Beau Bridges) checks in with a bone-crunching cameo Annies boss (Kristin Chenoweth) is another piece of work and a bunch of other comic actors drop by.As promised by the title there is a lot of car chasing on the road to L.A. although it seems more of the donuts-in-a-parking lot variety a tires squealing around tight circles. But Shepards character spends most of his time dealing with everyone elses issues. As it happens Alexs anger at being double-crossed is nothing compared with Annies who keeps reeling as new details about Charlies past emerge.The writing is more disciplined than the directing which gets rough around the edges the more the action spins out of control. The benefit of having friends fill the film besides the sheer talent is that it makes for good chemistry on screen; not surprisingly the best is between Bell and Shepard. From the opening moments that find Charlie and Annie still in bed the tone is set a playful sweetness rather than steamy sex as he tries to shore up her ego. The couple has said Charlie and Annies relationship looks a lot like theirs and you believe it.The comedy however comes from any number of sources. There is a good bit of slapstick most of it courtesy of Arnold whose marshal is about as hapless and hopeless as the Stooges Curly. At other times the humor comes from unexpected quarters the ""surprises"" as likely to elicit groans as guffaws since this is where the gross-out factor is in overdrive. And finally there is the funny that is mined from the friction that accompanies any relationship.This is Shepards strong suit and it is where the film is at its best as the actor uses his perpetual talkie-deadpan to tackle hard truths. Whether Charlie is arguing that teasing is just a ruse for real issues or trying to diffuse Alexs anger over a humiliating prison romance Shepard has an eccentric way of mixing the farce and the facts. It serves to make Charlie as endearing as he is frustrating which definitely comes in handy for the times ""Hit amp; Run"" goes off track.betsy.sharkeylatimes.comHit amp; RunMPAA rating R for pervasive language including sexual references graphic nudity some violence and drug contentRunning time 1 hour 35 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESHit amp; Runs Dax Shepard talks about his driveAugust 22 2012Kendall Brothers Make Fast Drive Up Auto Racing RanksJune 2 1988MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-hit-and-run-movie-review-20120822,0,7502930.story",200,hitandrun19,hitandrun,latimes

His transportation mishaps grow repetitive but his use of a fictional iPhone app is pretty hilarious.Annie is offered a chance to head up a new department at a university in Los Angeles and in a matter of hours their lives go from quietly predictable to precariously dangerous. Charlie knows Annie shouldnt pass up this opportunity but hes not supposed to return to Los Angeles the scene of his crime. Suddenly theyre running for their lives. Along the way she learns his real name and that he drove the getaway car in a bank robbery. Hot on their trail is Charlies former partner-in-crime Alex (Bradley Cooper nearly unrecognizable in dorky shades and dreadlocks) and Alexs accomplice girlfriend Neve (Joy Bryant).About the movieHit and Run out of fourStars Kristen Bell Dax Shepard Bradley Cooper Tom Arnold Kristin Chenoweth Beau Bridges Joy Bryant Director Dax Shepard and David PalmerDistributor Open Road Films Rating R for pervasive language including sexual references graphic nudity some violence and drug content Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens Wednesday nationwideThe movies best moments are the funny-sweet exchanges between Shepard and Bell and the ridiculous banter between Cooper and Shepard. Because Annie believes in resolving conflict peaceably she makes Charlie promise not to resort to violence as they flee their pursuers. What comes of that promise and their discussions on the issue are equal parts earnest and comical.The action-packed rom-com hinges on the likability of the low-key Shepard and the bubbly Bell and their connection has a fresh winning charm.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Hit and Run"" has a drive-in goofiness that Roger Corman would admire. This one checks all the boxes for summer escapism hot cars hotter women highway hooliganism a hell-raising hero hapless cops hilarious villains no plot and no apologies. Its a high-performance tire-smokin auto chase designed to appeal equally to gearheads action fans and tag-along girlfriends who like a little kissing and relationship talk along with all the carsploitation. The movie is no triumph of storytelling but its a fine example of colorful filmmaking. The plot revolves -- or rather careens -- around Charlie (Dax Shepard) a laid-back rural Californian and his sweetheart postgrad student Annie (Kristin Bell Shepards real-life fiancee). Though his last name is Bronson Charlie is about as assertive as a bean bag which may be part of his appeal for Annie. Her academic focus is nonviolent conflict resolution so naturally shes drawn to the most easygoing guy in the county. The overture is ham-handed comedy with too-cute comic bickering between the lovebirds shrub-shredding automotive slapstick involving a visiting U.S. marshal (Tom Arnold) unable to keep his minivan on the road. The opening scenes are so inept it seems unimaginable the film will get on track and tell us a tale. Soon enough Charlie pulls the tarp off his hot-rodded 1967 Lincoln Continental to drive Annie to L.A. for her dream faculty job interview. That muscle car is as black as Charlies past which resurfaces to transform their leisurely drive into a stuntmans holiday. Soon theyre at the head of a high-revving motorcade with the federal lawman Annies stalkerish ex two bumbling local cops and Charlies best-friend-turned-nemesis (Bradley Cooper) in hot pursuit. Charlie it seems has some history with the witness-protection program and bank robbery. The film boasts several slumming stars in odd juicy roles with Kristin Chenoweth Beau Bridges and Sean Hayes in pleasingly eccentric turns. Cooper usually a suave guy is the wildest and wooliest of all. His vengeful robber sports yellow aviator glasses a cascade of blond dreadlocks and appalling fire-engine-red track pants. Hes the sort of hair-trigger psycho who acts pacifist one moment and pistol-whips a bystander for purchasing inferior dog food the next. HIT AND RUN  out of 4 stars Rating R for pervasive language including sexual references graphic nudity some violence and drug content. Shepard a gangly guy whos cute for a comedian makes Charlie an ongoing surprise. Hes more resourceful than we expect and forever struggling to keep the inherent violence of the chase from escalating into something terminal. He and Bell ad-lib effortlessly. We see the playful chemistry that would keep them together even when parting would be the practical move. As the yarn moves along Bells Annie comes across as an unusually intelligent and assertive girlfriend. Charlie is given some funny-offensive thoughtless things to say about minorities and under Annies politically correct prodding he learns to think first and talk later. Its a clever way to combine guilty laughs with teachable moments. Sharing directors duties with David Palmer Shepard sort of clobbers you with scenes. His favorites involve cars driving very fast side by side trading paint. This is ridiculous but its sublimely ridiculous -- pure old-school stunt work. No CGI just real cars crashing into real cars and real brave people driving em. If you miss those ""Cannonball Run"" days of the 1970s when gas was 5 a tank anything less than six cylinders was a joke and the asphalt stretched on forever your film has arrived.

His second feature as a triple-threat (following 2010s little-seen ""Brothers Justice"") certainly cant be faulted for trying as Shepard daringly shoots for outrageous humor that intelligently flirts with political incorrectness while simultaneously attempting to revive great car-chase movies in the vein of ""Dirty Mary Crazy Larry"" and two-thirds of the films made by Burt Reynolds between 1973 and 1984. For all its good intentions however seeing ""Hit and Run"" is an experience akin to watching a basketball teeter around and around the rim before eventually thudding to the ground. With so many lazy and phoned-in movies out there its uniquely frustrating to see Shepard come so close to his lofty goals and still fall short. Shepard stars as Charlie whos been hiding out in rural California ever since he turned states witness against his former friends after they started robbing banks. Charlies happily cohabiting with college professor Annie (Kristen Bell) whos been offered the opportunity to ditch the tiny local university for a shot at teaching at UCLA. Despite the fact that going back to the big city will expose him to danger Charlie insists upon driving her there so he pulls his custom Lincoln Continental out of storage for the trip. Cue the high-speed road trip with calamity on all sides from Charlies overprotective and accident-prone federal marshal Randy (Tom Arnold) to Annies obsessive ex Gil (Michael Rosenbaum) to a larcenous redneck (David Koechner) to Charlies vengeance-minded criminal ex-cohorts (played by Bradley Cooper Joy Bryan and Ryan Hansen). The movie certainly never lacks in forward motion -- Shepard who co-directed with David Palmer obviously wanted an excuse to drive a variety of cool vehicles -- but it never manages to build momentum even with its contrived ticking-clock of getting Annie to L.A. on time. Editor Keith Croket frequently fails to keep things as tight as they might have been and those extra seconds of air can be deadly to either a comedy or a car-chase movie much less to both. Then theres the matter of the films audacious humor which is more admirable than it is funny. Shepard clearly went after the idea of taking taboo subjects -- rape the use of the word ""fag"" etc. -- and trying to be witty about them while also acknowledging the fact that said subjects arent at all amusing. And while he manages to get through it without tying himself in knots or opening himself up to accusations of boorishness the material still doesnt pack a comic punch. You can respect this screenplay for the way it self-consciously teeters on the edge of bad taste without going over and still not laugh very much. (Especially at the running gag about the motel room full of elderly naked swingers which just feels mean.) At the same time theres plenty to admire here particularly the talented cast who seem to be pitching in on this labor of love with plenty of good spirits. Lunches were no doubt lots of fun and at least some of that bonhomie bleeds into the final film. ""Hit and Run"" is a disappointment but its the kind that makes me want to see what its creators do next assuming theyve learned something from this experience and can grow as filmmakers. As it stands theyve put together some delicious ingredients for a souffle thats collapsed. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

But when the lady gets a plum job opportunity in Los Angeles our heros checkered past--which includes a vengeful gangsta wanna-be (Cooper) and a buried satchel of money--comes back to haunt him. Interminable scenes of macho posturing and mock-Tarantino dialogue (including a lengthy dissection of the word fags) mark time between a number of ineptly staged car chases that would embarrass the makers of Cannonball Run II.

Conflict duly arrives when a prestigious opening at the first department specializing in her chosen field is announced in Los Angeles. L.A. happens to be the one place Charlie cant go though for Charlies name is not really Charlie and he is in the Witness Protection Program--but hes in love so he offers to drive Annie into the lions den.The name ""Charles Bronson"" and the 67 Lincoln Continental that Charlie takes out of mothballs for the trip should establish Hit amp; Runs cinematic pedigree along with the pursuing Cannonball Run entourage Charlie and Annie pick up as they head west Annies absurd ex Gil (Michael Rosenbaum); the federal marshal appointed to Charlie Randy (Tom Arnold); and finally the former accomplice whom Charlies testimony put in jail Alex Dimitri (Bradley Cooper)--for contrary to the less-culpable backstory he has given Annie Charlie used to be a bank-job getaway driver named Yul Perkins.This is one of the many couple-fight issues that Charlie and Annie will have to find time to work through while running for their lives. Shepard and Bell are a couple offscreen and Charlie and Annies badinage is as much of friends as lovers heavy on put-down endearments (""Youre so terrible on the eyes"" ""Fatass"" etc.). Charlie and Annies ongoing conversation and compromise--theirs is pointedly a relationship not a romance--contravenes the precisely defined gender roles of chase-film predecessors like 1972s The Getaway with Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw and 1971s Vanishing Point with Barry Newmans Kowalski protected in stoic silent impermeable masculinity by the chassis of his Dodge Challenger.Hit amp; Run arranges a head-on collision between 1970s individualism and 2012 p.c. Where Kowalski hands out a whipping to degenerate homo hitchhikers Charlie takes a dressing-down from his girlfriend for using the word ""fag"" as a synonym for ""lame"" and there is a genial subplot involving gay law enforcement using a takeoff of the popular Grindr hookup app. Coopers blond-dreadlocked Dimitri is introduced in the supermarket checkout line and pounces on a huge black guy after an exchange of words. While loaded with racial animus--Dimitri has a black girlfriend--the scene takes a ""postracial"" flip The issue is the industrial dog food the guy was buying for Dimitri is a conscientious animal-lover and buys top-shelf. Later when Charlie pulls onto a college campus in a buggy one of the many vehicles he adopts during the course of the film hes heckled from offscreen for not ""going green"" to which he responds ""Its biodiesel friend""--and who knows if hes joking?Hit amp; Run was shot fast and cheap using cars from gearhead Shepards own garage. The stunt driving warrants only passing mention for its never more than serviceable--one wishes that Shepard and co-director David Palmer had spent a little more time studying Walter Hill and a little less on Hal Needham. The cast was apparently hastily cobbled together by calling in favors around Hollywood which partially explains the films premise that outlaws have the same concerns as right-thinking (read left-leaning) actors. That even the criminal class has gone sensitive and finicky eco-conscious has some potential for comedy--or drama as in Oliver Stones undervalued Savages--but theres no single detail that might convince a viewer that the characters played by Dax Shepard and Bradley Cooper might ever have been compelled to steal for a living and this alienates the crime picture from any social context or sense of actual danger making it essentially a celebrity goof-off.The action is of the all-in-good-fun variety like Hit amp; Runs jibing about race and sexual orientation. In matters of caste however Shepards middle-class sanitization of blue-collar drive-in material touches on the genuinely unpleasant. Is the supermarket beatdown innocent if the recipient cant afford the upscale dog food? ""There is a certain type of person who is attracted to this vehicle"" chirpy little Annie says of Charlies Continental. ""People who are . . . lets just call them rapists out of convenience."" You get the sense though that shed rather call them rednecks. So much of the movie plays like the mirror image inverse of the scene in which the snooty sociologist goes into the honky-tonk in Every Which Way but Loose (1978) and gets dressed down by Clint Eastwood and his buddy--except this time its the honky-tonkers who are told whats what by the conscientious well-bred liberal spark plug.Spinning these Nixon-era folk archetypes into a chastening ideological 180 degree isnt the same thing as sophisticating them though and Hit amp; Run goes slack from the lack of any real back-and-forth. Annies snobbery is never challenged. As to whether shes in any way impressed or even--against all the dictates of her idea of herself--turned on by the revelation that her floppy mensch of a boyfriend has a heretofore-unexpected capacity for self-defense and getaway driving theres no indication. Its a battle of the sexes that cant be called conflict management so much as ""Yes dear"" concession.

Photo Jeffrey Reed Open Road Films Hit amp; Run review Dialogue drives caper 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Hit amp; Run Action comedy. Starring Dax Shepard Kristen Bell and Tom Arnold. Directed by David Palmer and Dax Shepard. (R. 96 minutes.) ""Hit amp; Run"" is the kind of remedial Quentin Tarantino film that was getting made by the score in the years immediately following the 1994 release of ""Pulp Fiction."" Thats not as insulting as it sounds. We could probably use more clever writing and lively action on a tight shooting schedule and scant budget. You start to see things like politically incorrect dialogue and real car wrecks - no time or money for computer-generated images when your star director writer and editor are all the same person. That would be Dax Shepard a comedic actor who historically has often been the best thing in a bad movie. Shepard is Charlie Bronson a talented driver in witness protection trying to keep a good thing going with girlfriend Annie (Kristen Bell). When Annie gets a dream job in Los Angeles Charlie decides to follow as a growing cast of cops robbers and other meddlers get in their way. Shepard is an engaging actor who looks convincing behind the wheel. But hes arguably strongest as a writer here offering takes on car culture gay dating apps and the casual use of homophobic slurs. When the characters are sitting around talking the film cruises along nicely. Shepards editing and direction by contrast are held together with baling wire and paper clips. Pretty much everything shot by Shepard and co-director David Palmer looks as if it was done in one take. ""Hit amp; Run"" is closest in tone to the Tarantino-penned ""True Romance"" but it lacks that movies menace. Its hard to take anything too seriously when Tom Arnold shows up every few scenes handling his gun like Barney Fife while sounding as if hes channeling ""Lethal Weapon II"" Joe Pesci. Clearly some favors were called in for this film which features a glimpse of Jason Bateman and Bradley Cooper in a supporting role as bad guy Alex Dmitri. Hes hard to recognize in dreadlocks and a tracksuit (and you may spend most of the movie mistakenly thinking hes Seth Green) but thats still a pretty big name for an independently financed movie coming out in late August. Kristin Chenoweth owns all of her scenes as Annies diminutive but foulmouthed community college boss. Directors who dont have Jane Lynch money should consider Chenoweth as a capable substitute. But the real star is Dax Shepards 1967 Lincoln Continental a car so boss its desecration is arguably the emotional core of the movie. The makers of ""Hit amp; Run"" didnt have the time or resources to choreograph very elaborate chases. But as we already learned in ""Dazed and Confused"" theres still no special effect that can match a rumbling American motor while Aerosmiths ""Sweet Emotion"" plays in the background.

As an actor Dax Shepard can be an amusing galoot like a slightly slower brother to Owen Wilson. But unlike his character in the cult flick ""Idiocracy"" Shepard has aspirations. He is not just the star of ""Hit and Run"" he is also the writer editor and co-director (with David Palmer).Its hard to discern the division of labor but its clear that this action-comedy is being pulled in a couple different directions. Some of the odd comedic detours are funny but the action never hits a high gear and the romantic subplot is an annoying backseat driver.Shepard plays a reformed bank robber who calls himself Charlie Bronson a pseudonym he adopted when he was placed in a witness-protection program. Its a pretty sweet gig as he doesnt seem to do anything except soak up the desert sunshine and provide moral support for teacher-girlfriend Annie (Kristen Bell Shepards real-life squeeze). But when Annie gets a job opportunity 500 miles away in Los Angeles where Charlies former cohorts want to kill him he risks his life to drive her there in his hot-rod Lincoln. Standing in the way is Randy (Tom Arnold) the ridiculously clumsy U.S. marshal who is Charlies handler; and Gil (Michael Rosenbaum) Annies jealous ex-husband who is willing to chase her all the way to L.A.After Gil does some sleuthing and contacts Charlies vengeful ex-partner (Bradley Cooper with dreadlocks and a short temper) the movie veers into neo-noir territory. Yet with two directors fighting for the wheel ""Hit and Run"" is never as fast and furious as it pretends to be. Its driven by loopy digressions and eccentric characters. Cooper makes a complicated and politically correct psycho Kristin Chenoweth talks dirty as Annies pill-popping boss Bell adds a few new wrinkles to her usual spunky-girlfriend routine and Shepard reins his slacker-dude tendencies with some smart-but-sensitive repartee. ""Hit and Run"" isnt a catastrophe but it leaves loose ends and a more adventurous map by the side of the winding road.Hit and RunTwo and half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 140  Content Strong language nudity violence and drug use Joe Williams reviews Hit and Run Premium Rush Film critic Joe Williams chats with CineStars Brittany Umar about ""Hit and Run"" starring Dax Shepard ""Premium Rush"" starring Joseph Gordon-...

"Hit amp; Run | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hit-run ) Hit amp; Run (United States 2012) August 21 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli For an action comedy its generally advisable that the movie be (a) exciting (b) funny or (c) both of the above. In the case of Hit amp; Run the unfortunate choice is (d) none of the above. A slow meandering misfire of a movie this co-directorial production of David Palmer and Dax Shepard tries hard to achieve a Quentin Tarantino vibe (consider the sequence focused on the ingredients of an inferior brand of dog food) but doesnt do a good job. Its like Mozart being interpreted by someone whos tone-deaf. (Im sure Tarantino would get a kick out being compared to Mozart.) And the ending is so flaccid that it takes a few minutes to realize that the climax has come and gone. (Women may be more familiar with that experience than men.) Some of Hit amp; Runs comedy is just plain strange. Although ""strange"" does not necessarily equate to ""funny"" theres a penchant for quirkiness. Consider for example the hotel room occupied by a group of old naked fat people. (Note in the trailer they have been given CGI underwear but theres not of that in the movie - sort of like Natalie Portmans chainmail bikini.) Thats where Hit amp; Run earns the ""nudity"" in its rating content description. The scene isnt really funny (unless you find out-of-shape human bodies to be funny which I suppose is possible - think Kathy Bates in About Schmidt) but it is unusual. Most of the material with Tom Arnold whose character exists exclusively for comedic purposes is more annoying than amusing. The opening scene is illustrative of the films overall tone. Tom Arnolds character a Federal marshal named Randy spills coffee on himself while driving. He pulls over to the side gets out of the car and forgets to put the vehicle in park. The car starts rolling away on its own with Randy in pursuit firing his gun at it. This is more embarrassing than funny - a cartoonish scene that even Adam Sandler might reject. When it comes to the action side of the equation Hit amp; Run isnt much better. There are three car chases although two are so perfunctory that to call them ""chases"" might be deemed an exaggeration. There are also a couple of brief fights but thats about it. Does Hit amp; Run want viewers to become invested in the characters? I suppose thats the goal even though theres not really a likeable individual in the film and more than one is nails-on-the-blackboard annoying. Liking anyone is a chore. The protagonist is a lying slacker who constantly hides things from his girlfriend and shows little willingness to accept the consequences of his actions. The ""innocent"" girlfriend is whiny and self-righteous. And the villains spend too much time acting cool and reciting ""hip"" dialogue to be imbued with sufficient malice. The story revolves around ""Charlie Bronson"" (Dax Shepard) or at least thats what he calls himself. When he entered the witness protection program after testifying against his former best friend Alex (Bradley Cooper) in a bank robbery trial he was permitted to trade in his birth moniker Yul Perkins for something more intimidating. For the past six months he has been living in Podunk CA with his new girlfriend Annie (Kristen Bell). He loves her so much that when shes offered the job of a lifetime in L.A. he decides to opt out of his new life and go back to the scene of the crime. That might work well if it wasnt for Annies jealous slimy ex Gil (Michael Rosenbaum) who does a little on-line sleuthing and discovers most of the salient details about Charlies past. He then Facebook-friends Alex and informs him that he knows the location of his one-time best buddy and driver. This leads to the three aforementioned chases the highlight of which occurs when Randys SUV goes airborne. Bradley Cooper who has made a career out of playing nice guys lacks the badass gene. His character is not the least bit intimidating. Dax Shepard who co-directed and wrote the screenplay is okay as Charlie but he spends too much time rationalizing his actions. For Kristen Bell this is another dead-end role that makes one wonder whether she needs a new agent. She has become so typecast that shes sleepwalking her way through these parts. Hit amp; Run could use a little sex appeal to liven things up but it doesnt come from her. The movie is typical of what gets released at this time of the year. Its the end of August and this is when studios and distributors dump their trash so those titles can arrive on DVD/Blu-Ray/streaming without the ""direct to video"" tag which remains a badge of dishonor. Theres no expectation on Open Roads part that this is going to do very well at the box office and based on the quality of the production no reason for them to be proven wrong. Even for home viewing Hit amp; Run would be considered marginal - the kind of film that would not be paused for bathroom breaks and trips to the refrigerator.

Dax Shepard puts his friends fiance Kristen Bell even his own vehicles to good use in ""Hit amp; Run"" a fun little car-chase comedy thats quite infectious -- the good time clearly had by the filmmakers rubs off on the audience.Done on a tiny budget the movies stunts and chases are nothing much but the lack of resources steers the story away from action and toward the characters who are wry irreverent even endearing.Screenwriter Shepard the ""Parenthood"" co-star who directed ""Hit amp; Run"" with David Palmer tailors the roles to suit his pals including Bradley Cooper Tom Arnold Kristin Chenoweth and ""Parenthood"" co-star Joy Bryant.The result is like a student film made by pros weirdly idiosyncratic but efficiently paced. Its well-scripted and well-acted and if ""Hit amp; Run"" lingers too long on so-so gags and inside jokes Shepard and his friends found particularly funny it compensates with a freewheeling spirit that pulls viewers along for the ride.Shepard stars as a guy in witness protection who took the name Charlie Bronson -- just why is one of the subtly amusing bits of ""Hit amp; Run."" A former getaway driver for a gang of bank robbers Charlie betrayed his pals for a sort-of noble reason but Shepards doesnt play him as a hoodlum with a halo. Charlies a man who did wrong is trying to make amends but offers no excuses for his misdeeds and is willing to pay the price should they come back to haunt him.Of course they do. Now living in rural California with academic Annie (Bell) Charlie decides to break cover and drive her back to his old stomping grounds in Los Angeles where shes got an interview for her dream job running a campus program in conflict resolution.Through the scheming of her old beau Gil (Michael Rosenbaum) Charlie and Annie wind up pursued by his old gang including Alex Demitri (Cooper) and Charlies ex-girlfriend Neve (Bryant).Arnold plays federal agent Randy Charlies witness-protection minder. A hapless blusterer Randys at the center of many of the movies physical gags; some are mildly funny but theyre mostly repetitive and disposable often putting the brakes on the action so Arnold can launch into another fit of bellowing.Oddly for a road romp the main charm of ""Hit amp; Run"" comes from the verbal exchanges either when the characters are standing still or sharing strange intimacies during a high-speed chase.Shepard and Bell make such a natural couple on screen that its easy to imagine them right or wrong living out a blissfully perfect relationship in real life. They share low-key tender moments and some tough intelligent quarrels that feel genuine enough to have filtered up out of their own experiences together.Coopers an oddly engaging bad guy his dreadlocks and gaudy red running pants setting him apart from the usual Hollywood heavy. He blends viciousness with sensitivity compassion with greed making Alex all the more volatile dangerous and entertaining for his unpredictability.Chenoweth has a couple of bawdy scenes as Annies boss and Beau Bridges pops up briefly as Charlies dad. ""Hit amp; Run"" also features quick cameos from other buddies of Shepard and his crew. The goodwill among all these friends spills off the screen to make ""Hit amp; Run"" despite its bland title more clever and distinctive than the average chase flick.Shepard cast two of his own vehicles -- a supercharged 1967 Lincoln Continental and his Tatum racing dune buggy -- and he demands as much from them as he does of the actors. Our cars are extensions of our lives and temperaments. The fact that Shepard laid his wheels on the line puts an even more personal spin on the movie.""Hit amp; Run"" an Open Road Films release is rated R for pervasive language including sexual references graphic nudity some violence and drug content.

Hit and Run Fair to good Director Dax Shepard. Cast Dax Shepard Kristen Bell Bradley Cooper. Rating R for pervasive language including sexual references graphic nudity some violence and drug content. Thats probably for the best because it doesnt give you much time to slow down and think about the story. No matter. Just slam the pedal to the floor blast on past the weaknesses in the plot and enjoy the ride. Shepard plays Charlie Bronson a nice fellow living in the sticks with his girlfriend Annie (Kristen Bell Shepards real-life girlfriend). She teaches at the local college a good-enough job but one that doesnt put her doctorate in non-violent conflict resolution to work. Charlie is not currently burdened by employment. Interview Kristen Bell Then during Annies performance review her boss the foul-mouthed Xanax-popping Debbie (Kristin Chenoweth) tells her that a college in Los Angeles wants to interview her for a position custom-built for her academic specialty. Its a great opportunity with one problem Charlie cant go to LA. It turns out that he testified in the case of a bank robbery that turned into a murder and is now in the witness-protection program. This explains the visits by Randy (Tom Arnold) the dim-bulb U.S. Marshal assigned to his case. After as brief an amount of soul-searching as possible to keep the story moving Charlie makes his choice Hell drive Annie to LA after all even if it means blowing his cover. And hell do so in the tricked-out 1967 Lincoln Continental hes been hiding -- one of a few secrets hes been keeping from Annie. Unfortunately Annie needs her teaching certificate which she left at the home of Gil (Michael Rosenbaum) her unstable ex-boyfriend. Gil is convinced that Charlie is a dangerous criminal so he chases after them. Whats more he not only learns Charlies real name but lets the brains of the bank robbery Alex Dimitri (Bradley Cooper) know where Charlie is and where hes headed. By Facebook no less. And then the chase is on -- with Randy who is charged with keeping Charlie safe joining in. At this point the movie changes considerably and the adjustment in tone is not subtle. A somewhat offbeat romance shifts gears and becomes something more menacing and violent. In that regard its somewhat reminiscent of ""Something Wild"" though Jonathan Demmes movie is more accomplished. But Demme was after something deeper a study of repression and eventually overcoming it. Shepard is content to make ""Hit and Run"" more of an adrenaline rush. There are some nods to honesty and redemption but the level of attention paid to them is considerably less than that paid to pure horsepower. Shepard plays Charlie as a likeable goof a man who had made mistakes but is determined to move past them. He and Bell have a nice chemistry though one suspects that her constant analyzing of every situation might get old. Coopers character isnt fleshed out but he is chubby and dreadlocked. And Beau Bridges has a nice cameo as Charlies dad an attempt to drive home the redemption message. But really thats secondary. In ""Hit and Run"" the emphasis is on moving fast. Most of us may not be able to outrun our problems but in the case of Charlie Bronson its not for a lack of trying. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

An unexpectedly satisfying date-movie spin about a redneck lothario (Shepard) who confronts old demons in order to drive his booksmart g.f. (Kristen Bell) to a big-city job interview this low-budget B movie looks poised to surprise potentially rivaling the success Open Road Films enjoyed with ""The Grey"" earlier this year. Comic actor Dax Shepard isnt the kind of guy who comes to mind when trying to cast a Hollywood action movie. After putting himself in the drivers seat with ""Hit amp; Run"" however the goofy-acting ""Punkd"" host merits future consideration. An unexpectedly satisfying date-movie spin about a redneck lothario (Shepard) who confronts old demons in order to drive his booksmart g.f. (Kristen Bell) to a big-city job interview this low-budget B movie looks poised to surprise potentially rivaling the success Open Road Films enjoyed with ""The Grey"" earlier this year. Arriving on the heels of ""Brothers Justice"" a 2010 mock doc in which Shepard and co-director David Palmer explored the possibility of transforming the cheeky prankster into a Chuck Norris-style action hero ""Hit amp; Run"" represents a far savvier vehicle for such a career rewrite than the Z-grade exploitation pics pitched in that film. Even so ""Hit amp; Run"" relies on many of the same actors and friends --  Tom Arnold Bradley Cooper and David Koechner among them --  to support the endeavor. Shepard plays Charlie Bronson a meathead who seized the opportunity of entering the witness protection program to reinvent himself as a better man. Stuck in a backwater California town Charlie seems admirably devoted to Annie (Bell) a brainy Ph.D. with a degree in conflict resolution whos stuck teaching at a local community college. But their relationship is tested when her well-meaning boss (Kristin Chenoweth) threatens to fire Annie unless she interviews for her dream-job opening at UCLA. At this point neither the audience nor Annie knows anything about Charlies past but little by little clues emerge hes a muscle-car aficionado originally christened Yul Perrkins who may have witnessed a bank robbery back in L.A. For Charlie Annies job opportunity means defying the inept federal agent (Arnold) assigned to his case and then having to face the gang he testified against -- a trio headed by Cooper. Most of what follows is fairly stock stuff but the formula works for several well-calculated reasons. Shepard (who wrote the script) tailors his character for maximum female appeal playing Charlie/Yul as a scruffy fixer-upper. Whatever mess the guy was mixed up with back in L.A. Shepard looks a shave and a haircut away from being marriage material. Hes puppy-dog loyal has a great sense of humor and always knows exactly what to say to soothe Annies neuroses. Charlie caters to the macho contingent as well earning Annies disapproval as he cracks off-color jokes at the expense of gays hicks and other races -- a canny cake-and-eat-it strategy by which the film can land the un-PC laugh then correct it with a more enlightened rebuttal. Guys will also appreciate Charlies choice of wheels a turbo-charged 1967 Lincoln Continental the same sleek black sedan featured in ""The Matrix."" If Annie is his wife-to-be then this baby is his mistress. Above all real-life couple Shepard and Bell bring genuine chemistry to this high-energy excursion. Charlie may be the one behind the wheel but Annies refreshingly intelligent and assertive personality elevates her beyond mere love interest offsetting the scripts sophomoric tendencies with her erudite badinage. Shepard and Palmers lean co-helming effort should connect especially well for middle-American auds seeking characters and stories that approximate the thrill of crashing tailgate parties and NASCAR races. The fact that Shepard is chummy with a number of fairly recognizable actors merely sweetens the deal with memorable turns from Arnold and Cooper as well as a wonderfully abusive cameo by Beau Bridges. Arnold in particular enjoys a chance to monkey with his too-often-typecast hothead persona. Barely able to control his own firearm his flustered ""Smokey""-like lawman not only updates the 70s-chase-movie formula by joining forces with Shepards affable bandit he also gets his own romantic subplot courtesy of Pouncer a GPS-based gay-dating app clearly modeled after Grindr. Shepard and Palmers shared direction is alternately energetic and easygoing smoothly shifting gears between hot-rod and romantic comedy modes.

Daily Edition Login to download Hit and Run Film Review 901 PM PDT 8/19/2012 by John DeFore FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Dax Shepard left and Bradley Cooper in ""Hit and Run"" On-the-run love story delivers charm despite some unwise detours. TWITTER Dax Shepard wrote and co-directed the comic chase film which also stars Kristen Bell Bradley Cooper Tom Arnold and Beau Bridges. A chase-oriented B-movie that borrows from True Romance for both good and ill Dax Shepard and David Palmers Hit and Run benefits from a surprisingly sweet vibe and easygoing chemistry between Shepard and co-star Kristen Bell both in fine form. Its high-octane but low-stakes action might be just the thing for moviegoers weary of summers operatic superheroes. Shepard plays Charlie Bronson an L.A. bank robber who after his partners killed a security guard testified against them and was hidden in tiny Milton Calif. Bronsons a sensitive stoolie though and showers new girlfriend Annie (Bell) with daily affirmations and selfless love. Still he hasnt told her how he came to be in the witness-protection program letting her believe hes always been the benevolent charmer he is today. VIDEO Dax Shepard and a Dreadlocked Bradley Cooper Square Off in Hit and Run Trailer When Annie gets a job offer she cant refuse in L.A. Charlie decides to risk going home -- breaking out the muscle car he drove in his bad-boy days to take her downstate. Unfortunately the vintage Continental (with suicide doors natch) not only brings out traces of Charlies old self -- cue an amusing debate over acceptable usage of the word ""fag"" -- but is a clue allowing Annies old boyfriend Gil (Michael Rosenbaum) to suss out Charlies identity and in an effort to split them up to contact his revenge-minded old gang. What follows is an old-fashioned cross-country pursuit in which the aforementioned parties are joined by the marshal (Tom Arnold) responsible for Charlies welfare and a pair of highway patrol officers. Its an enjoyable ride though the filmmakers push some gags close to the breaking point. Arnolds accident-prone cop who can barely touch his gun without shooting innocent bystanders is too clumsy by half (not to mention loud). And Bradley Cooper as the ringleader of Charlies old gang seems inexplicably to be offering a variation on the ineffably strange pimp Gary Oldman played in True Romance Dreadlocked and wearing yellow-tinted shades hes a white boy affecting ghetto attitude and afflicted by an in-and-out Southern drawl. The performance is the most distracting but certainly not the only reminder of Tony Scotts 1993 chase-romance; even the soundtrack with its echoes of Hans Zimmers marimba doffs its hat. STORY Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell Elderly Nudes True Love and the Sloth Video In the most important respects though Hit and Run makes its lovers-on-the-lam premise its own. Shepard is as likable as ever believably pairing gentleness with outlaw savvy; Bell doesnt take Annies indignation at Charlies past so far that we hold it against her. Beau Bridges as Charlies estranged dad is a standout in the supporting cast requiring just a few minutes of screen time to lend some emotional depth to the heros backstory.

They tease each other mercilessly but theres clearly love underneath the jocular facade. Annie is a professor on the rise while Charlie is in witness protection. Wait a sec witness protection? Indeed Charlie finds himself protected day and night by a bumbling Federal Marshall named Randy (Tom Arnold). Annie gets a big break for a job she really wants but its in Los Angeles which means leaving her beloved Charlie behind. Charlies got plenty of enemies waiting for him in Los Angeles like his former crime crew headed up by Bradley Cooper. Naturally Charlie chooses to drive her to LA consequences be damned. The movies rockiest moments are at the very beginning with the introduction of Annie and Charlies relationship and Randys role in Charlies life. Everyone is just trying just a little too hard and its unclear where the story is going. Once they hit the road ""Hit and Run"" takes off. Almost all of the interactions are clever though slightly over-the-top with plenty of one-liners lobbed between real-life couple Bell and Shepard. Cooper also has room to shine as do David Koechner Beau Bridges and Kristin Chenoweth. Luckily the rest of the film redeems its clumsy beginning proof positive that this Dax Shepard fellow can act and direct. (Hes joined by David Palmer in the directors chair.) There are at least four solid chase scenes to behold here and the scripting is clever enough to give us different car match-ups each time. Ever wondered what a mini-van looks like in an oversteer? Look no further. A new and shiny Corvette is used with extreme prejudice while a simply lovely 1967 Lincoln Continental is shown off like a prize-winning pie recipe. ""Hit and Run"" does the one thing each and every film must do if its to leave a favorable impression - stick the landing. The film gets stronger as it progresses to the point where youre will to forgive the initial awkwardness. Music is woven in fluidly and slow motion is used to great effect. There are inauthentic contrived moments where its clear the cast and crew are in on the joke. However its eminently clear that the goal here is fun and fun is achieved on the regular. Its fairly close in terms of scope to ""The Mexican"" from back in 2001. Youll hate ""Hit and Run"" if youre not into the crass modern styling of violent cinema and if a car chase leaves you yawning then this wont be for you. However for the rest of us the great silent majority ""Hit and Run"" is a pleasant little treat.

Yeah its that kind of film. Its a romantic comedy. Its a fun-loving summertime flick. Its ... a full-blown action movie? ""Hit amp; Run"" is many things -- so much so that it suffers from multiple personality disorder. Yes its a romantic comedy starring real-life couple Dax Shepard (who also wrote and co-directed) and Kristen Bell. Its also a heist movie picking up the narrative after the heist-gone-wrong and dealing with the troubled aftermath. And mostly its a car-chase movie with multiple high-speed scenes that show off the muscle of cars instead of men. And thats no unfair criticism. Shepard will be the first to call ""Hit amp; Run"" a car chase movie. Cars are among the ""Parenthood"" actors greatest passions having grown up in Detroit and theyre lovingly featured here -- from the feminine soft-edged chase that starts things off to the more aggressive machismo-fueled scenes that follow. The rom-com/car chase back-and-forth doesnt always work but a fun story and affable cast keep things moving fluidly. Shepard plays Charlie Bronson a getaway driver who ratted out his pals in exchange for a comfortable witness-protection spot. His girlfriend Annie (played by Shepards fiancee Bell) knows of the witness-protection limitations that wont let him back in Los Angeles but shes not familiar with the extent of his crimes -- and burned bridges. Their perfect love story -- which comes off very naturally on film well admit -- hits a snag when Annie is offered a dream job that would utilize her doctorate in nonviolent conflict resolution. The position is in Los Angeles and Charlie does what any selfless lover would do by risking his life for a quick drive into the city to see if the job is right for her. The situation worsens when Charlies clumsy pal and U.S. Marshal case officer (Tom Arnold) finds out he has fled and follows. And then Annies deluded possessive ex-boyfriend (Michael Rosenbaum) gets angry and even by researching Charlies real name and history and contacting his former accomplices with Charlies whereabouts. Its worth noting that Shepard might as well have studied at the Luke Wilson School of Acting -- what with his aw-shucks second-guessing and his vaguely Southern charm. Its not a negative comment but his character here is strikingly similar to his work on the popular NBC dramedy ""Parenthood."" The first 45 minutes of ""Hit amp; Run"" play off that same polished brand of dramedy and the cutesy interplay between Shepard and Bell -- alongside scenes of Arnold expertly acting a fool -- are intensely enjoyable. (To his credit Arnold has rarely been funnier than he is as this bumbling lawman.) When ""Hit amp; Run"" turns into an action film it loses some of that charm. Thats not to say this film is stupid in any way. The dialogue is easy and honest and the story keeps your interest. As a writer Shepard includes a couple clever traps that pay off in the end. The best of which is Charlies tendency to resort to violence -- to protect himself and Annie in life-threatening situations. Having studied nonviolent conflict resolution Annie doesnt support that at all -- and the conversations that happen as a result are both endearing and philosophically rewarding.
