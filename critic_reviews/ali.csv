Monitor Movie Guide Freighted with an overload of gizmos hardware and special effects ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" is exhaustingly inventive. This 3-D sequel to Tim Burtons ""Alice in Wonderland"" directed by James Bobin and written by Linda Woolverton substitutes technological phantasmagoria for genuine wonderment. Watching it I felt like I was viewing the piece-by-piece construction of a gigantic mechanical contraption. Its an achievement of sorts but its worlds away from the poignant lunacy of the Lewis Carroll books which except for a few of its cast of characters this behemoth in no way resembles.As in Burtons movie which was a surprise billion-dollar-grossing smash hit the new film features Mia Wasikowska as Alice and Johnny Depp as her dearest friend the Mad Hatter. Alice is now a buccaneering ships captain and the Hatter is deeply depressed about his missing family. To rescue him she ventures back to Underland and has a confab with Time himself plummily played by Sacha Baron Cohen in an accent that could perhaps best be described as Austro-Yiddish. His Chronosphere enables Alice to travel back to the Hatters childhood and attempt to undo the bad times.There are other parallel subplots including a sibling smackdown between Anne Hathaways chalk-white queen and Helena Bonham Carters Red Queen as amusingly feral as ever. Because Burton didnt direct (though he remains a co-producer) the film isnt as icky-Gothic as its predecessor and Depp in a too-small role has a touching fragility. But the only heartfelt moment of this movie for me came in the end credits with its dedication to the late Alan Rickman who provided the voice for the blue butterfly (and former caterpillar) Absolem. What a voice what an actor what a loss. Grade B- (Rated PG for fantasy action/peril and some language.)

One with something to say about something real -- in this case family and time-- and a willingness to admit consequences even as it serves up goofy humor mild thrills and slippy-slidey accents from slumming stars. (Sacha Baron Cohen might have made something great from his personification of Time but its enough that the character at least inspires interest.) The story concerns a plucky girl who tries to set the present right by venturing into the past with complicated results. The girls name is Alice and the present problem has to do with her friend the Mad Hatter but thats almost incidental.

Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to the whimsical world of Underland and travels back in time to save the Mad Hatter. film review Alice Through the Looking Glass is a complicated unnecessary narrative Add to ... Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 27 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday May 27 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by James Bobin Written by Linda Woolverton Starring Mia Wasikowska Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter Classification PG Country USA Language English In Disneys live-action sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass the Mad Hatters tea party reconvenes - but now theres an unexpected guest.Time himself shows up. Hes a towering figure half-human half-mechanical and played by the typecast Sacha Baron Cohen as another preposterous tyrant this one measuring lifespans and marshalling seconds. True the Hatter once boasted of a nodding acquaintance with Time - ""...if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock"" he says in the first of Lewis Carrolls classic childrens books - but this big dark clown seems out of place at the pastoral party where the pocket watch gets dunked in the teacup. Out of place that is until he makes the dastardly decision to freeze the action at one minute before tea There the Hatter the dormouse and the March hare will sit in perpetuity without ever managing to eat or drink. Its a pleasing nod back to the source material (where the tea partiers were stuck at 6 oclock) but this delicate moment is rare and hard-won in a film that otherwise seizes on Carrolls chronological metaphors and pounds away at them with CGI in one fist and revisionist storytelling in the other.Tim Burtons hallucinogenic reworking of Alice in Wonderland in 2010 may have been overwrought and noisy but at least there was a certain whimsy to its crazed aesthetic and a certain logic to its feminist script in which a 20-year-old Alice (Mia Wasikowska) must return to the dream world of her childhood to escape an enforced engagement to a domineering bore. Now as director James Bobin (The Muppets) takes over the franchise the imagery hardens and the attempt to stuff the episodic Carroll into a three-act structure produces a narrative that is both complicated and unnecessary. Turns out that Burtons disinclination to direct this sequel was rather wise.Here Alice returns from the sea voyage to China on which she embarked at the end of the previous movie to discover that her former fiance is ready to repossess her family home. If falling down the rabbit hole was a good way to escape the ghastly Hamish (Leo Bill) pushing through the looking glass seems like simple avoidance. So screenwriter Linda Woolverton comes up with a torturous tale about the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) needing Alice to rescue him from despondency over the loss of his family to another dastardly plot by the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).Woolverton has done some interesting work reclaiming fairy tales from their sexist assumptions (Maleficent) but Alice was never a dozing damsel. In the books she proved inquisitive adventuresome and aggressively commonsensical quick to challenge the upside-down logic of Wonderland. In these film versions that argumentative girl has turned into a bold lady seemingly so Disney can market the movie to young adults as well as children.Of course a lack of fidelity to the original is no sin - many viewers wont have read the books - if the result is a compelling story with a unique vision. Instead this sprawling tale trades yet again on cultural affection for Alice the Hatter and the Red Queen without incorporating them into a story or a design that can stand on its own feet.As Alice Wasikowska who has lost the injured look that made her so effective the first time out creates a character who is fundamentally sweet likeable and loyal. Shes an admirable person but not a very interesting one and if the Red Queen calls her irksome and slurvish youll just have to take her word for it that Alice could ever irritate anyone.Playing the irascible queen Bonham Carters delicious performance as the ultimate mean girl is a welcome repeat but as Woolverton piles up the back stories the movie gets bogged down in the explanation of her lifelong enmity against the White Queen. (Anne Hathaway makes that character so delicate she threatens to evaporate.)Meanwhile Depp can do gleeful eccentricity like few others but as the story forces the Hatter and the maniacal actor in a funk over the lost family his performance dissolves into wide-eyed sadness and a once-amusing lisp becomes an affectation.All the pop psychology behind the Hatters insanity and the Red Queens wrath is revealed in scenes that take place in a Tudor village where the Hatters family lives. Its a conventional fairy-tale sort of setting that abandons Burtons more idiosyncratic vision to little effect.The palace of Time on the other hand is the films chief artistic achievement a dark and vast place seemingly inspired by the infinite reflections of mirrors or the great expanses of the ocean. Its a cheerless if intriguing setting that plunges Alice into a world of haunting vistas and adult fears not successfully explored by the script.And while Baron Cohens Time is amusing with his erratic pretensions wavering accents and pathetic devotion to the Red Queen the concept is stretched to the breaking point. When Time introduces his ""seconds"" they appear as a sweet little animated team of oil cans and watchmakers tools but soon they gather together climbing on top of each other to build a minute. And that is a figure of menacing violence designed to stop Alice in her tracks. Bizarrely it just looks like a retread from the Transformers movies.A century and a half after Rev. Charles Dodgson began telling stories to the Liddell sisters an inquiring child will still ask ""What would happen if time stopped?"" These days it seems that the only answer the adults can muster is ""Lets see what the computer effects department has up its sleeve.""

Whether blending actors with slick post-production tricks or going for pure effects its a nonstop visual overload.But everything is so overly artificial and computer generated that it begins to look like nothing more than a wash of FX a whiz kid showing off the power of his new apps. An alternate title could be ""Alice Through the Screensaver.""Of course the world of the film is meant to be fantastical but director James Bobin -- stepping in for Tim Burton who brought his warped visual sensibility to the first film -- loses any sense of humanity in his wonderland.It all becomes digital noise made to seem even more synthetic in a 3-D presentation that doesnt add anything except a couple of dollars to the ticket price.Mia Wasikowska returns as Alice who when the film opens in 1874 is sailing the high seas leading her fathers ship through a rainstorm through the Straits of Malacca and saving her crew with her instinctual know-how.But she is soon visited by Absolem (voice of Alan Rickman rest in peace) who leads her back to the world of Wonderland. It turns out things arent so good with her old friend the Hatter (Johnny Depp returning to the role) whose family thought to be dead might be alive. Alice doesnt believe him which causes Hatter to shut down and all but lose hope.""You are not you"" he whispers to her.That leads Alice to Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) the cracked timekeeper who maintains the worlds clock whom Cohen plays as a cranky mischief maker with a thick Russian accent. If Alice can just jump back in time she can figure out what happened with Hatters family and bring him back to his zany self.She swipes the Chronosphere -- get used to that word its used a lot -- which is essentially the heartbeat of the world clock and she begins jumping through time trying to restore order to the land. But the Red Queen also wants to get her hands on the Chronosphere which would make her an even more powerful force.Oddly ""Through the Looking Glass"" winds up hinging on a childhood incident between the Red Queen her sister the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and some spilled dessert crumbs. Turns out a whole lot of disruptions in the space-time continuum and narrative chaos could have been solved with a simple ""sorry"" which isnt much to hang a film on but its what passes for drama in Linda Woolvertons congested screenplay.If theres a saving grace here its Depp who at this point could sleepwalk through one of his signature wackadoodle character portrayals (and does in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films) but gives his lisping Hatter a gentle innocent spirit beneath the Carrot Top wig and plastered makeup. Hes not on screen much but when he is you want more which isnt always the case with Depps sideshow showboats.Still Depps not enough to overcome the nagging sense of hollowness at the center of ""Looking Glass."" Burton had the right idea sitting this one out; one trip to ""Wonderland"" was plenty.agrahamdetroitnews.com(313) 222-2284twitter.com/grahamoramaAlice Through the Looking GlassGRADE C-Rated PG for fantasy action/peril and some languageRunning time 113 minutes 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1TI73sF TOP VIDEOS Oakland County Sheriff car chase052East Detroit Schools CEO superintendent ready to work together333Trump denies he encouraged Russia to hack Clinton emails035Donald Trump discusses pulling out of NAFTA tariff for Ford123Zoom Gas Station029Surveillance video of breaking and entering029Highland Park eco village brings basics back to Avalon Street2572016 Festival of Chariots parade154Debbie Dingell adresses unity town hall meeting118World Peace mural135 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/opinion/columnists/adam-graham/2016/05/26/movie-review-second-alice-trip-wonderland/85016090/,200,ali4,ali,detroitnews

But the magic is missing in this sequel as is Burton replaced in the directors chair by James Bobin (Muppets Most Wanted).  Most wanted here is easy charm to counteract the hard sell. Everything is too much making the movie look like Willy Wonka threw up all over his chocolate factory. The script by Linda Woolverton stays surface faithful to the characters created by Lewis Carroll but the film has lost its soul. More News Summer Movie Preview 2016 Attack of the Blockbuster Clones Johnny Depp An Outlaw Looks at 50 Sacha Baron Cohen on Trump Gross-Out Gags and Grimsby 15 Best and Worst Johnny Depp Roles All Stories >> Related Where Did Alice Through the Looking Glass Go Wrong? Five ideas why the sequel to Tim Burtons 2010 revisionist fairy tale flopped big over the holiday weekend Mia Wasikowska is back as Alice now a ships captain eager to vanquish pirates. She dragged kicking and screaming back to London to affirm her Victorian-era feminist agenda by saving her mothers livelihood and busting the balls (well almost) of a nasty former suitor (Leo Bill) whos making life hell for mom. Alice also finds time to leap through a looking glass and return to Wonderland. The gangs all here including Tweedledee/Tweedledum (Matt Lucas) the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen) the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway). The late great Alan Rickman to whom the film is dedicated voices the caterpillar-turned-butterfly Absolem with the wit and resonance that marked his career-long artistry. But Alices main concern is her friend the Hatter again played by Johnny Depp who makes eccentric madness look as natural as breathing. The Hatter you see is not himself. Hes dying of sadness ravaged by guilt that he and not the evil jumbo-headed Red Queen (the ever-delicious Helena Bonham Carter) is responsible for the death of his family. What to do? Alice must go back to the past in a time machine stolen from Time himself in the person of a frantic Sacha Baron Cohen and set things right. Bobin keeps the plot gears grinding relentlessly and monotonously. The actors except for Depp and Bonham Carter -- for whom surrealism seems like a second home -- merely go through the motions.

James Bobins extravagant fantasy -- which is based not at all on Lewis Carrolls 1871 book Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There -- is a sequel to Tim Burtons phenomenally successful 2010 live action film Alice in Wonderland. That one did at least echo Carrolls 1865 book Alices Adventures in Wonderland (as well as parts of Through the Looking-Glass) although with some major differences in the storyline and Alices age. The new movie picks up three years after the 2010 film ended with Alice now a courageous sea captain who is seen outrunning and outwitting pirates. She returns home to England to find her life circumstances greatly altered. Escaping her oppressor Alice returns to the nonsensical and illogical world she encountered before finding circumstances in Wonderland greatly altered as well. Especially because The Mad Hatter has fallen into deathly despair. This sequel now stands no chance of reaching the level of critical acclaim popularity and 1 billion worldwide box office of the original. Here are five reasons why that is disconcerting and ultimately disappointing 1 - THE PLOT While Bobin rightly says that Carrolls 1871 book is pretty much unfilmable the alternate universe that American screenwriter Linda Woolverton conjured is pretty much unfathomable. Woolverton who also wrote the screenplay for Alice in Wonderland tripped up by working with Bobin on a convoluted story about a half-human half-mechanical and all twitterpated creature named Time. While he clanks around in his clock-heavy universe Alice steals his time machine to travel back to the day when The Mad Hatter lost his family the source of Hatters emotional crisis. Time travel is difficult to dramatize properly -- especially in an already cluttered movie -- and it proves to be the wrench in the gearbox here. 2 - THE CASTING OF ALICE At 26 Mia Wasikowska is now obviously too old to play a teenaged Alice. In adulthood her Alice Kingsleigh lacks the charming naivete of Carrolls original character. Plunging a full-grown woman who already works as a sea captain into the topsy-turvy madness of Wonderland is missing the point of Alices adventures which are actually her rites-of-passage into maturity. 3 - THE CASTING OF EVERYONE ELSE Johnny Depp is absolutely heartbreaking again as Tarrant Hightopp/The Mad Hatter. It is a role that Depp seemed born to play given his delicate vulnerability and his dazzling penchant for risk-taking. But there is not enough of him - and too much of Alice - for the movie to succeed. Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter return as The White Queen and The Red Queen respectively but are both less interesting with fewer challenges -- and the maudlin resolution of their conflict is creepy. Meanwhile we have Sacha Baron Cohen as Time and his deliberately ""British Twit"" behaviour is irksome even if it means his character is not a traditional villain. New support players include Rhys Ifans as Zanik Hightopp the Mad Hatters overbearing if loving father. He is always a pleasure to encounter. But we shed a tear hearing the late Alan Rickmans voice as Absolem one final time. 4 - THE VISUALS The 2010 film was eye-popping a fantasy with feeling. Burtons opus was nominated for three craft Oscars winning two including best costume design (Colleen Atwood) and best art direction (shared by Robert Stromberg for production design and Karen OHara for set decoration). While Atwood is on-board with the sequel neither Stromberg nor OHara returned. The new movie does look gorgeous though. Except in the time-travel sequences when the digital visual effects look sloppy. Oscars are unlikely this time. 5 - THE POINT OF IT ALL For all of director Bobins efforts -- and they were considerable if you think of the scale of this 170 million production -- Alice Through the Looking Glass has no real purpose. Alice is already Alice for life in this story so her new adventures do not have lasting meaning for us.

But this soulless Disney contraption a sequel to Tim Burtons hit Alice in Wonderland (2010) instead offers child-psyche self-pity both the garish Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and the ranting Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) turn out to be adult victims of parental cruelty or injustice. As in the earlier movie Carrolls wormhole narrative has been replaced by a mechanical action-movie plot and once again theres a tedious frame set in the real world with Alice (Mia Wasikowska) as a professional sea captain who may have to sacrifice her ship to save her mothers home from creditors. Director James Bobin is almost completely indebted to Burtons original vision though Sacha Baron Cohens performance as Time and the attendant clock imagery that dominates the second half call to mind Martin Scorseses Hugo (2011).

Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Walt Disney Pictures Johnny Depp in Alice Through The Looking Glass. Walt Disney Pictures Were not in Wonderland anymore if indeed we ever were. Most likely wed already left it far behind with the 2010 Tim Burton reshuffling of Alice in Wonderland. That smash hit repurposed elements from both of Lewis Carrolls Alice books including sequel Through the Looking-Glass while setting the action around a 20-year-old Alice (brave soldier Mia Wasikowska) returning to the land of her childhood dreams. So with all the famous bits already checked off and the ""rite of return"" storyline over and done with the logical step would have been to retire this new green-screen Alice like the Cheshire Cat allowing her to vanish from sight leaving only the grin of her impressive box office receipts. But oh not so Alice Through The Looking Glass is here. It has left behind Burton who returns as a producer while handing the directors chair off to James Bobin (who rebooted The Muppets with such success). And it has left behind Carroll as well. Characters may still share names with familiar residents like Johnny Depps Mad (in name only) Hatter; Helena Bonham Carters shrieking decapitation-obsessed Red Queen/Queen of Hearts mashup; Anne Hathaways White Queen gliding her arms about like a New Age priestess; and the cadre of talking animals like the White Rabbit the March Hare and the unamused blue butterfly Absolem (Alan Rickman in his final performance). Yet they assuredly do not live in the same place we remember from our dreams. The Wonderland of Looking Glass no longer operates under the pleasing illogic thats captured childrens minds for generations where to quote Carroll ""The Hatters remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly English."" Instead impossibly Disney has morphed this setting into yet another dismal fantasy place with villages and family structures and traditional coronation ceremonies for royalty. The Red Queen has a traumatic childhood memory with an explanation for that gigantic head and temperament. Even the Mad Hatter has an orange-haired family; not only that but he has a stuck-up traditionalist hatter father (Rhys Ifans) who frowned upon his sons whimsy as a child. A whimsy-free business in Wonderland of all places There could be no more ironic stand-in for todays franchise-mad movie marketplace here to lop the heads off any and all creative personnel. These new decidedly non-wondrous layers are revealed once Alice having first escaped the real world through a looking glass so as to technically satisfy the films title uses a ""chronosphere"" (its sort of a steampunk gyroscope trinket) to jump back in time. The time travel comes after returning screenwriter Linda Woolverton a Disney veteran expends a great deal of effort acclimating us to 1874 Britain where Alice clad in a peacock-colored dress from China has become the female-empowerment captain of her fathers ship. Then we get another lengthy table-setting to re-introduce the old crew and explain the chronosphere and why Alice feels compelled to use it. If youre counting there are at least three distinct scenes wherein Alice steps gingerly across some threshold and into a new land all shot from above with swooping wide angles that emphasize the hollow digital environments. Why did this movie need to nestle time travel inside a world of make-believe like panic rooms (break in case of board-room boredom)? Has Disney so lost its way since its golden era when it once made a beloved 1951 animated Alice that it can no longer find enough magic in one fantastical concept per film? Maybe theres not much left to fill 113 minutes worth of Carroll-lite galumphing once youve carefully stripped away any lingering references to hallucinatory substances. Such studious family-friendly tinkering has resulted in a PG-13 rating though since children shouldnt be wasting their brains with this anyway perhaps we should be thanking the Mad Hatter MPAA this time. Alice Through The Looking Glass isnt the worst bleached-dry contractually obligated sequel to a fantasy reboot this year -- not when The Huntsman Winters War is sitting right there (and doing little else). Bobins film manages some moments of creativity including an effect that coats all of ""Wonderland"" in scary rust and Sacha Baron Cohens strange performance as Time personified. In all his movies Cohen exists in his own private Wonderland and here he seems at home ad-libbing dire proclamations. His character who seems to have been inspired by a brief aside in the original novel comes with ticking gears in the back of his head and a full clock face in his stomach -- but here the film can only muster up a series of awful puns and a rulebook for time travel that frequently breaks down. Its enough to drive one mad. But in this new Jabberwockd land of brand deposits where Alice and her friends can be suckered into temporary sanity for the good of a movie poster madness has no meaning anymore.

"Alice through the Looking Glass | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; alice-thorugh-the-looking-glass ) Alice through the Looking Glass (United States 2016) May 26 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Alice through the Looking Glass may represent Disneys first big-budget failure in quite some time. More likely to inspire thoughts of Michael Bay than Lewis Carroll this sequel to Tim Burtons 2010 Alice in Wonderland borrows sparingly from the Carroll novel with the same title opting instead to use Linda Woolvertons confused and incoherent story as its basis. The movie is frequently incomprehensible and on those occasions when it makes sense the viewer may wish it didnt. Visually Alice through the Looking Glass has its moments but pretty backgrounds and clever special effects cant obscure the disappointment resulting from a half-baked script and a miscast villain. Alice through the Looking Glass begins an unspecified time after the end of Alice in Wonderland. Back in the real world Alice (Mia Wasikowska) has been spending several years as a sea captain. After an improbable escape from pirates she returns home in seeming triumph only to learn that in her absence her fathers business has been sold out from under her. In that moment of despair she is lured back to Wonderland where all of her old friends are waiting for her. But theres a crisis. The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is acting more mad than usual and Alice learns that in order to ""fix"" him she must locate the Chronosphere a time-traveling device jealously guarded by Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) and discover the truth of what happened to the Hatters family. Time however is allied with an old enemy of Alices The Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who remains devoted to engineering the downfall of both Alice and her sister The White Queen (Anne Hathaway). Although Alice through the Looking Glass has a plot its points are mostly convenient opportunities for nonsensical action scenes. Its the ""sound and fury signifying nothing"" problem - lots of special effects and running around but no real sense of danger or suspense. Does anyone really accept that Alice is ever in danger? Does anyone believe entropy will destroy the universe once its unleashed? By failing to capture an emotional human toll for any of its characters Alice through the Looking Glass becomes a show reel for its special effects crew. Theres no heart no soul and (strangely for a Tim Burton-produced movie) no unique vision. The film owes at least as much to Transformers as it does to Alices creator Lewis Carroll who would surely turn over in his grave if he saw this movie. This isnt his deliciously trippy Wonderland - its a stale imitation inhabited by characters who recite familiar lines like slogans. (""Off with her head"") As if all that wasnt bad enough the movie decides its a good idea to italicize the fact that Alice despite living in the 18th century is a modern woman whose worldview and ideals match those of someone born more than 100 years later. Im all in favor of strong women characters but if one is going to make a period piece some care has to be taken about meshing the concept of ""female empowerment"" with the views of the day. Alice could have shown her strength through her actions (which she does at least to an extent). Adding lines to the screenplay that instruct us about this is unwarranted. Then theres Sacha Baron Cohen who apparently thinks hes in Monty Pythons Life of Alice. Wow. Cohens attempt to blend slapstick humor with sinister intentions is distracting and off-putting. Compared to his performance Johnny Depp comes across as restrained. Director James Bobin lacks Burtons skill when it comes to effectively incorporating weird ideas and characters and its hard to find a more discordant example than Time. The decision to add an army of bumbling droids to the proceedings as a means of amplifying the comic relief is a step further in the wrong direction. I wish I could offer a more upbeat assessment of what is easily Disneys worst high profile motion picture in years. The success of Alice in Wonderland made the sequel a necessity and Carrols writings provided a template that if deconstructed and reworked could have resulted in a worthy second chapter. Instead Linda Wolverton chose this path and the result speaks for itself. Im not sure who this movie was made for. Not little kids - it will be too confusing and at times too scary for them. Not older viewers who will find the time travel paradoxes poorly developed and the action sequences tedious. 2010s Alice in Wonderland was a pleasant surprise and enjoyable diversion.

"Alice Through the Looking Glass squanders a classic tale review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAlice Through the Looking Glass squanders a classic tale review Time flies but also plods in Alice Through the Looking Glass the curiously frantic yet flatlining sequel to Tim Burtons 2010 blockbuster Lewis Carroll reimagining.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. May 26 2016Alice Through the Looking GlassStarring Mia Wasikowska Johnny Depp Anne Hathaway Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen. Directed by James Bobin. Opens May 27 at GTA theatres. 113 minutes. PGTime flies but also plods in Alice Through the Looking Glass the curiously frantic yet flatlining sequel to Tim Burtons 2010 blockbuster Lewis Carroll reimagining.Time in the figure of Sacha Baron Cohens frightful man-machine leaps about through various contraptions and gyrations. Hes the amusingly villainous new addition to a returning cast of mainstays Alice (Mia Wasikowska) the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).Article Continued BelowBut time the clock-ticking kind is far less fleet. Shorn of much of the whimsy and wordplay that made Carrolls Alice tales immortal and Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland a treat this belated revisiting fractures the narrative and tries the patience.Burton now settles for a production credit handing the directors reins to James Bobin who knows both mayhem and Baron Cohen from his time with The Muppets and TVs Da Ali G Show. Linda Woolverton is back as screenwriter and Disney as the corporate presence.Like Alice theyre all dressed up but with nowhere to go -- either through the looking glass the rabbit hole or the time-travelling Chronosphere that adds a curiouser and curiouser sci-fi slant to a fantasy that requires only imagination to succeed.We first meet Alice no longer a child in troubled waters as the captain of a ship called Wonder evading pirates on trade routes to China. You go girl -- but a return to London brings betrayal and banishment that only a restorative return trip to Wonderland can fix.There she finds more trouble. Her friend the Hatter is now sad rather than mad his mojo a no-go from the gloom of being tragically orphaned. Alice is sent by the White Queen (whose quarrel with the banished Red Queen begins anew) to knick the Chronosphere for a backward trek through time thus to prevent the Hatters family tragedy and restore his crazy smile.We all know the rules of messing with time and learn the perils of thwarting Time but where is Lewis Carroll in all this? The movie has its charms but it squanders a classic tale Burtons enthused visuals and a grand cast -- which also includes character voices by Michael Sheen Stephen Fry Timothy Spall and the late Alan Rickman -- on a misguided quest to turn a Wonderland idyll into a multiplex thrill ride. ""The only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible"" Alice says but some impossible missions are best left untried.

"Alice Through the Looking Glass is more blunder than wonder - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Alice Through the Looking Glass is more blunder than wonder ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" Peter Mountain / Disney Enterprise Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to the whimsical world of Underland and travels back in time to save the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to the whimsical world of Underland and travels back in time to save the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" (Peter Mountain / Disney Enterprise) Justin Chang ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" is a movie for anyone who ever skimmed a passage of Lewis Carroll and thought ""This is great but it could use a bit more Terminator.""In Disneys crass pointless sequel to its similarly crass pointless ""Alice in Wonderland"" (2010) our heroine doesnt just tumble down a rabbit hole or step through a magic mirror. Availing herself of an early DeLorean prototype called the Chronosphere Alice (played again by Mia Wasikowska) goes careening back and forth through time embarking on a frenzied quest to save her friend the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) by plumbing his messy family history and correcting the mistakes of the past. Its a pity she doesnt set the device for 2007 Perhaps she might have retroactively persuaded the director Tim Burton and the decision-makers at Disney to spare us the further desecration of a literary classic. Their live-action ""Alice in Wonderland"" was less an adaptation of its source material -- which included both Carrolls ""Alices Adventures in Wonderland"" (1865) and ""Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There"" (1871) -- than an exercise in what the Mock Turtle memorably termed ""Uglification."" A gloppy-looking 3-D eyesore weighed down by noisy action sequences and other soul-deadening focus-group notions of what kids want from their fantasy entertainment the movie reproduced none of Carrolls cleverness imagination or mastery of language or even the easygoing charm of Disneys 1951 animated version.Still it was enough of a box-office hit to garner a follow-up this time under the direction of James Bobin (who directed the two most recent ""Muppets"" movies). Burtons devotees will be relieved to learn that even in his absence ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" is a feast of garishly overwrought effects-encrusted production design. Meanwhile the returning screenwriter Linda Woolverton (best remembered for ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Lion King"") has again plundered elements from Carrolls books and reshuffled them into a pedestrian narrative replacing his sui generis nonsense with her own strenuously unimaginative and literal-minded storytelling. Picking up more or less where its predecessor left off -- and no I couldnt remember where either -- the film begins with Alice on the high seas captaining her late fathers ship the Wonder through perilous waters in search of trade routes to China (reintroducing a perhaps unintended metaphor for the global challenges presently facing the movie industry). As played by Wasikowska with grown-up no-nonsense seriousness Alice is a trailblazing explorer and a Victorian-era role model Decked out in the latest in 19th century Sino chic she is beset on all sides by sneering men who want to either marry her or see her fail. SNAP Video Official trailer for Alice Through the Looking Glass Official trailer for Alice Through the Looking Glass See more videos From there the story quickly whisks Alice through the proverbial looking glass and back to Wonderland -- or Underland as it is inconsistently referred to here. Before long she is reunited with the ethereally ditzy White Queen (Anne Hathaway) the White Rabbit the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) and the imperious butterfly Absolem (occasioning a few poignant final line readings from Alan Rickman). Her old friends are happy to see her as it seems only Alice can cure the Mad Hatter of his recent descent into catatonic depression.As a rule unless youre Spike Jonze adapting Maurice Sendak its not a great idea to turn your fantasy-world characters into moody therapy cases. ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" is rarely more tiresome than when its probing the Hatters deep-seated daddy issues which cant help but feel like a tired holdover from familiar Burtonian territory (see if you must ""Big Fish"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""). Depp again sporting multihued makeup and a Carrot Top wig isnt playing Mad so much as Morose as he tries -- with simpering sometimes nauseating results -- to unlock the tragic clown within.The Hatter isnt the only one suffering the effects of some distant family trauma. Theres also the head-hungry Red Queen played once more by Helena Bonham Carter with a witchy cackle and a severe case of computer-generated macrocephaly. We learn exactly how she and her younger sister the White Queen became lifelong enemies in flashbacks to their checkered past that play like outtakes from ""What Ever Happened to Baby Queen?"" Of all the ways to bring Carrolls characters to life on screen is there anything more tedious one could do than try to explain them -- to subject them to the tenets of modern-day psychoanalysis? Whats next? Humpty-Dumptys secret history of sexual deviance? ""Tweedledum and Tweedledee A Study in Codependency""? See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story The inconvenient truth of the original books is that they have never been particularly well suited to cinematic adaptation. As anyone who has spent hours poring over Martin Gardners marvelous ""The Annotated Alice"" knows the two-part Alice narrative is less a traditional story than a brainy free-associative labyrinth -- densely packed with puns poems parodies allusions and riddles and assembled with an almost architectural rigor and complexity (Carroll was among other things an accomplished mathematician).Understandably filmmakers have tended to seize on the fabulous images offered up by the authors work but the truest version of ""Alice"" would be a verbal achievement first and foremost not a visual one. But even allowing for a less faithful more free-form adaptation ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" like ""Alice in Wonderland"" before it represents a profound failure of imagination and a betrayal of the materials spirit. At every turn the filmmakers have simplified banalized and sentimentalized Alice and her psychological landscape in ways that reek of ignorance at best and cynicism at worst. Watching these movies you would never guess the Jabberwocky was the subject of one of the most linguistically inventive poems ever written; hes just another forgettable fire-breathing CGI beastie. And while its never unpleasant to spend time in Wasikowskas company the actress doesnt seem to be playing a strong fantasy heroine so much as some vague derivative concept of what a strong fantasy heroine should be.As Alice flies between past and present her chief nemesis -- and eventually her ally -- is Time itself played here as a sort of tyrannical Teutonic-accented man-clock by Sacha Baron Cohen (who previously worked with Bobin on ""Da Ali G Show""). The jab at German efficiency elicits a small chuckle and your jaw might drop at the sight of Times castle -- a massive mechanical enclave that brings the gears and pulleys of Martin Scorseses ""Hugo"" to mind and serves as a nicely gothic contrast to the films bright gaudy colors. For a brief moment time really does seem to stand still and you may stop begrudging this misbegotten movie for wasting yours. justin.changlatimes.com------------Alice Through the Looking GlassMPAA rating PG for fantasy action/peril and some languageRunning time 1 hour 53 minutesPlaying In wide releaseMOREHelena Bonham Carter brings her brand of formal oddity to Alice Through the Looking GlassWhat exactly does the sound and fury of Bryan Singers X-Men Apocalypse signify?Oscar Isaac gets his supervillain on for X-Men Apocalypse Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Spike Jonze Sacha Baron Cohen PG Rated Movies Anne Hathaway Martin Scorsese Bryan Singer Stephen Fry Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech isnt as large as for Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-alice-looking-glass-review-20160524-snap-story.html,200,ali13,ali,latimes

MOVIE REVIEW Alice Through the Looking Glass Running time 108 minutes. Rated PG (fantasy action mild peril rude language). You certainly get your 20 bucks worth of spectacle out of ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" So breathtaking are the landscapes so whimsical are the creatures so marvelous are the marvels that I wanted to give a standing ovation to whoever signed the check to pay for all this. Expensiver and expensiver Just an eye-blink ago this films director James Bobin was making ""Flight of the Conchords"" for HBO before moving on to the distinctly non-gargantuan movie ""The Muppets"" but ""Looking Glass"" redefines digital sumptuousness. At no point did I care about anything that was happening (only in the last five minutes does Bobin get around to trying to create some meaningful relationships amid the clatter) but seeking emotional resonance at a blockbuster fantasy movie is starting to seem a little eccentric like asking to see the wine list at Dennys. After a prologue in which Alice is a brave sea captain (an early signal that the movies resemblance to Lewis Carrolls ""Alice"" sequel ends with its title) we go back to Wonderland to find a severely depressed Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) who has been rendered miserable because hes thinking about his familys long-ago death via an attack by the dragon-like Jabberwock. Its a thin peg upon which to hang the sequel to 2010s ""Alice in Wonderland"" but off we go as Alice (Mia Wasikowska) confronts Time (Sacha Baron Cohen this time doing a Werner Herzog accent) an unyielding Prussian despot who in ending a life announces ""Times up."" Then he takes a pocket watch with a persons name inscribed on it and hangs it in a dank funereal void. Thanks to a Jules Verne-ish gadget called a chronosphere Alice sails across the oceans of time hoping to turn back the clock to save the Sad Hatters family from annihilation. Instead she discovers secrets about the long-standing feud between the sisters the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). The latter it turns out got her swollen head when she bumped it on concrete. Oh. Also there is a megadispute over some crumbs spilled under the bed when the two were princesses. So the screenplay (by Linda Woolverton) isnt exactly heaving with brilliant ideas but it works well enough as a blank canvas against which the special-effects team goes bonkers. Times realm is mystical and scary the Hatters chapeau-shaped abode is nutty enough to be approved by Willy Wonka and strangely endearing little beasties are everywhere. The scene in which everybody turns to stone is magnificent even if it turns out to be yet another bogus gimmick. (I thought the whole ""turned to stone"" thing was supposed to be kind of immutable.) As an adventure everything comes a bit too easily to Alice and the films message -- girls can do anything -- is bland. Rarely (as when the script rhymes ""dafter"" and ""laughter"") does it even hint at Carrolls pleasing whimsy. If its dry wit youre after you probably shouldnt be at the multiplex in the first place.

(Peter Mountain/Disney Enterprises) The high point of ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" comes early. A blue butterfly named Absolem -- voiced by Alan Rickman -- beckons Alice back to Wonderland. How wonderful to hear the late actors marvelous baritone one more time. Then just like that Absolem is gone -- along with any pleasant feelings about this joyless jumble of a sequel. For this second desecration of Lewis Carrolls prose producer Tim Burton has passed directing duties to James Bobin. The players remain the same including Mia Wasikowska as the films heroine. Ever the iconoclast Alice first appears as a ship captain in 1874 on the run from pirates in the Straits of Malacca. As it turns out shes a keen strategist nearly capsizing her boat in order to evade the brigands. Since every scene and snippet of dialogue hits you over the head with foreshadowing we know that her talent for improvised disaster control will come in handy later. Indeed once she makes her way back to Wonderland through a mirror she agrees to a dangerous mission. The Mad Hatter -- Johnny Depp hamming it up to a nearly unwatchable degree -- is so depressed that he cant leave his house. Hes convinced that his family who he once thought were killed by the Jabberwocky might be alive. But no one believes him. Alice doesnt either but shes always game to disprove the impossible. (In case you have any doubt she warns her first mate ""you know how I feel about that word."") Shell need to travel back in time to save the Hatters family from the fire-breathing menace. To do that she steals a machine from Time himself played by Sacha Baron Cohen. (The actor is a pal of Bobin who wrote and directed episodes of ""Da Ali G Show."") Helena Bonham Carter plays the Red Queen. (Peter Mountain/Disney Enterprises) Johnny Depp overacts as the Mad Hatter. (Peter Mountain/Disney Enterprises) For once Cohen isnt the loopiest overactor in the cast. Between Depp Helena Bonham Carter as the raging Queen of Hearts and Anne Hathaway -- practically floating as the ethereal White Queen -- the man who played Borat has stiff competition. With dazzling blue eyes and sporting a man bun Time is part man and part clock. The back of his head reveals ticking gears and he has a clock face where his heart should be. The character like a lot of visual elements in ""Alice"" is a sight to behold. There was clearly a lot of thought put into making the movie look spectacular. When Alice is ricocheting through history -- on a contraption that conveniently operates just like a ship -- memories embedded in waves rise up to meet her. Its a gorgeous metaphor for how recollections of the past wash over us. If only as much care were put into the slipshod story. Do we even care about these people? Nothing in the movie compels us to. Screenwriter Linda Woolverton (who was assisted by Bobin) is more satisfied answering questions that nobody asked. How did the Queen of Hearts head get so big? If youve ever wondered youre in luck. But wondrous visuals only go so far in a film that turns out to be lethally dull. ""I fear I may never see you again"" Alice laments to the Hatter toward the end of the movie. After one sequel too many we can only hope shes right. PG. At area theaters. Contains scenes of peril and some coarse language. 112 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

The sequel to Tim Burtons 2010 mega-hit ""Alice in Wonderland"" is loud frantic stunningly unfunny off-putting and riddled with mediocre out-of-tune work from normally outstanding actors. Its one of the great movie disasters of 2016. The problems begin with Mia Wasikowskas mousy undistinguished turn as Alice. Now in her 20s and fresh off years of exploring the world as the captain of the ship once owned by her late father Alice should come across as vibrant and worldly and filled with a sense of adventure. Granted shes a sweet honorable young woman but she also comes across as a bit dopey naive and stubborn. Mostly shes dull. James Bobin takes over the directing reins from Burton and is clearly an advocate of the go-big-or-go-home school of filmmaking. Working with a bloated nearly laugh-free screenplay by Linda Woolverton Bobin assaults the senses with overlong chase sequences pounding action scenes and big explosions leaving precious little time for the few (and admittedly entertaining) scenes involving familiar Lewis Carroll characters engaging in surreal and quite nifty wordplay. Once Alice escapes the sexist oppressive London of 1875 by diving through the looking glass shes reunited with Mirana (Anne Hathaway); Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas nimbly plays the brothers with the help of some cool CGI work); the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) and a number of other friends from her last journey to Wonderland. (The blue butterfly Absolem voiced by the late and beloved Alan Rickman facilitates Alices trip through the looking glass.) Just about everyone is happy to see Alice but they have dire news The Mad Hatter (a fluttering muttering Johnny Depp in one of his least effective and most affected performances) has gone even madder possessed with the seemingly delusional belief his family is alive even though everyone believes they were slaughtered long ago by the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Alice embarks on a hare-brained scheme to visit Time himself (Sacha Baron Cohen) and take possession of the Chronosphere a magical gold ball that enables one to cross the Ocean of Time and go back in history to change the course of events. And thats when ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" really nosedives. Sacha Baron Cohen is an immensely talented performer but from the moment he clomps his way into the film as Time employing an exaggerated semi-German accent and shamelessly mugging his way through the role it feels as if were doomed. Despite Times warnings to Alice and other characters about messing with the timeline especially if one sees a younger version of oneself (perhaps Time once traveled forward and saw the ""Back to the Future"" movies) Alice rolls the Chronosphere like a bocce ball which causes it to turn into a golden space vehicle-- and Alice is a natural at piloting the Chronosphere because as youll recall she was the captain of her dads ship back in the real world. Cue another action sequence with Alice warding off the attacks of mechanical enemies that look like precursors to ""The Transformers."" (And yes I know the Jabberwock from the poem Alice reads in Carrolls ""Through the Looking Glass"" is a winged chimera and was certainly the inspiration for the fire-breathing dragon in the movie.) The attempts at sentiment are heavy-handed. The Mad Hatter has Daddy Issues. Alice has Mommy Issues. The Red Queen has Sister Issues. Ugh. Of course the ""Alice"" adventures should have a freaky creepy unsettling look and on that count director Bobin and the special effects team succeed. Helena Bonham Carters giant head makes her look like an image from one of those disturbing social media apps. Tweedledee and Tweedledum are morose yet endearing. Humpty Dumpty has a pretty great fall. But other than some fine voice work most of the performances in ""Through the Looking Glass"" feel tinny and flat. Anne Hathaway veers in and out of some sort of regal accent. Bonham Carter chews up the scenery. Depps performance is all costume and makeup and contact lenses and wigs; theres no there there. And theres nothing to see here 1/2 Disney presents a film directed by James Bobin and written by Linda Woolverton based on characters created by Lewis Carroll. Running time 108 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for fantasy action/peril and some language). Opens Friday at local theaters.

VPCDirector James Bobin takes over for Tim Burton in this sequel which has little of the crazy magic of the first film.Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to the whimsical world of Underland in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass.""(Photo Peter Mountain)Story HighlightsCritics rating 2 out of 5 starsIt was surprising to be reminded that its been six years since Tim Burtons ""Alice in Wonderland"" which makes you think maybe there wasnt an urgent need for a sequel.Having seen ""Through the Looking Glass"" Id say thats still the case. Burtons gone replaced by James Bobin (""The Muppets"" ""Muppets Most Wanted"") who retains the acid-trip look and feel of the film. Mia Wasikowska is back as Alice and most of the rest of the cast returns as well including Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen (yay).Whats missing is a coherent story -- Linda Woolverton again writes the script but its not based on Lewis Carrolls work just inspired by it though thats a pretty diplomatic way of putting it.Alice (Mia Wasikowska) and Helen Kingsleigh (Lindsay Duncan) enjoy a fete in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" Colorful in that way that looks like someone drank several colors of Day-Glo paint and then threw up. (Photo Peter Mountain)Not that coherence was a necessary ingredient for Carroll. Yet his chaotic scenes and images coalesced on the page into brilliant works of inspired madness. Burtons film did a good job of capturing that.This film? Hmm. Well Carters really good. Other than that. ...The film opens with Alice captaining a ship executing daredevil moves that leave pirates run aground among the rocks. She always was a plucky sort.AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceBack home however she learns that the dopey Hamish (Leo Bill) whose marriage proposal she rejected in the first film has made a devils bargain with Alices mother (Lindsay Duncan) Alice and her mother must give up Alices ship to keep their home. (The ship is called the Wonder allowing characters to say things like ""You cant give up the Wonder"" Subtle its not.)Sacha Baron Cohen is Time in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" (Photo Walt Disney Pictures)Alice has a knack for getting out of tight spots in weird ways though and soon she goes through a mirror to Underland (not remember Wonderland). The gangs there with a notable exception the Mad Hatter. He found a scrap of paper he thought was lost with his family during a Jabberwocky attack. Now hes failing depressed and taken to bed because he doesnt know what really happened to them.RELATED The big guide to summer moviesThe White Queen (Anne Hathaway) instructs Alice to go back in time to fix things. This will require stealing a gizmo called the Chronosphere from Time (Sacha Baron Cohen doing his best Christoph Waltz). The Red Queen also wants the Chronosphere. Time travel allows for origin stories for the characters even if no one was asking for them. We learn that the Mad Hatters father (Rhys Ifans) was also a hatter and a stick in the mud who chastises his son telling him hats are not ""fun."" Meanwhile we discover some family history between the two queens including the incident that led to the Red Queen having such an oversized head (and temper).Lewis Carroll fans can rejoice as the character of Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to the screen in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" (Photo Walt Disney Pictures)Time is chasing after Alice because all this messing with history is messing with the universe. Stories that employ time travel set themselves up for scrutiny; its tough to make things match up neatly. Here there are other nagging plot hangnails. If you arrived some place a couple of minutes later than you wanted to why not just go back 10 minutes and start over? Isnt the beauty of a time machine that you never have to let things just play out?Of course you cant really change history as they say (more than once). But you can learn from it. Newsflash Alice does. But it doesnt seem like a very challenging lesson.MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestThe film looks trippy especially Times castle and his clock (and Time himself -- check out the mechanism that forms the back of his head). If nothing else Bobin does not skimp on the effects.Anne Hathaway is the White Queen and Mia Wasikowska is Alice in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" (Photo Peter Mountain)Hes not as generous with a more-important ingredient fun. Whos directing this thing the Mad Hatters father? There should be a sense of yes wonder at play at all times here.

Disney Disney Disney Disney Alice Through the Looking Glass    (out of five) Director James Bobin Cast Johnny Depp Anne Hathaway Mia Wasikowska Matt Lucas Rhys Ifans Helena Bonham Carter Sacha Baron Cohen Rated PG (fantasy action/peril language) Running time 108 min. By Maricar Estrelladfw.comPosted 1200am on Thursday May. 26 2016 Thursday May. 26 2016 Thursday May. 26 2016 By Maricar Estrella Fort Worth Star-Telegram Time is not your friend. The new Disney adaptation of Lewis Carrolls tome Alice Through the Looking-Glass seems to prove it not only with the length of the film but with the perplexing over-the-top manner in which the story is presented. The films plot line barely resembles Carrolls sequel the follow-up to the beloved book Alice in Wonderland. In the movie adaptation Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) returns to London after a three-year adventure at sea only to be marginalized by the men who funded her expedition. Alices mother (Lindsay Duncan) seemingly wants her to stay in her place as well. After following a blue butterfly she comes across a magical looking glass a mirror portal to the fantastical realm of Underland aka Wonderland. With guidance from caterpillar-turned-butterfly Absolem (voice of the late Alan Rickman) Alice reunites with her whimsical buddies the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen) the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway). Shes told that the Mad Hatter ( Johnny Depp) needs her help. During her journey Alice meets Time himself (Sacha Baron Cohen) and makes a mad dash to the past to save the Mad Hatter before time runs out.Director James Bobin ( Muppets Most Wanted) duplicates the visually stunning world he inherited from Tim Burton who helmed 2010s Alice in Wonderland. However the meandering pacing and convoluted storytelling make for a lackluster tea party. Even the actors seemed to lose their zeal talking in whispers for emphasis throughout the film. For young children the tale is too long at nearly two hours and a tad too dark. Like Hatter the film has lost its ""muchness.""In the film Alice proclaims ""Every second counts."" Thats not true for this sequel. Maricar Estrella 817-390-7720 maricare Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Disney Britton Peele GuideLive BrittonPeele bpeeledallasnews.com aAlice Through the Looking Glassa is a visual treat but narratively unfulfilling (C) May. 25 2016 1158am Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... With Britton Peele Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Like its predecessor Alice Through the Looking Glass has a lot of visual splendor. There are intriguing characters (some CG some merely impressive feats of makeup and costumes) dream-like environments and fancy special effects. But when you look at it purely as a story this sequel canat hold a candle to the classic Alice in Wonderland story a or even many of its modern offshoots. Sacha Baron Cohen as Time Disney Following the events of Disneyas live-action Alice in Wonderland Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) has become the captain of her fatheras ship the Wonder and is clearly quite adept at navigating not only rough seas but also the adult world. While things arenat perfect in 1875 London Alice shows maturity and spunk when dealing with issues of money trade routes and a society thatas letas just say a bit sexist.Before she has much chance to get her land legs back after a journey to China Alice finds herself led once again into the mysterious world of Wonderland where her old friend The Hatter (Johnny Depp) has become worryingly ill. For reasons that barely make sense even in the topsy-turvy realm that is Wonderland the only way to save The Hatter is for Alice to steal a powerful device from Time himself (Sacha Baron Cohen) and travel into the past in an effort to save Hatters family.Aside from using the titular looking glass as a portal to Wonderland this Through the Looking Glass bears almost no resemblance whatsoever to Lewis Carrollas own Alice sequel similarly titled Through the Looking-Glass. Itas an original plot based on the classic characters which isnat in and of itself a bad (or even new) thing but the plot does little other than serve as a vehicle for the eye candy of colorful characters and wondrous landscapes. Part of the problem is Alice herself. Though itas been years since her last adventures in Wonderland the magic she encounters throughout this sequel seems to strike her as (if youall pardon the pun) an old hat. Aliceas lips may read aCurioser and curiousera but her body language says aOh this again huh?aSheas clearly happy to see her old friends again but thereas not a lot of wonderment in her eyes. I guess if youave seen food that can make you bigger once youave seen it a hundred times.To be fair the original Alice stories written by Lewis Carroll werenat always masterpieces of plot either. But at their worst they were journeys of metaphors and the wonderfully poetic language could make up for a lack of substantial character development. Alice Through the Looking Glass tries to do the same with visual poetry but the effects arenat up to the task. Johnny Depp as the Hatter Disney The cast for its part does well enough. Deppas Hatter still sits on an interesting line between charmingly crazy and disturbingly unhinged and Cohenas personification of Time has enough quirks to make him enjoyable. Helena Bonham Carter returns as the Red Queen and her gleeful abuse of other creatures is still fine though her character motivations by the end feel half baked.Itas also nice to hear Alan Rickmanas voice one last time as the former-caterpillar now-butterfly Absolem though sadly his involvement adds up to a mere handful of lines near the beginning of the film.For adults there are far more interesting takes on the Alice mythos out there in a variety of mediums (comic books video games etc.). Even ABCas ill-fated show Once Upon a Time in Wonderland attempted more interesting things with these classic characters.For children who just want to revel in cinematic weirdness though this film might suffice.

Johnny Depp is an oddly disconnected the Mad Hatter with Mia Wasikowska as a full-grown Alice in an unhappy attempt at ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" Photo Peter Mountain Associated Press Looking Glass Somewhere Lewis Carroll is throwing up 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In this abominable adaptation of ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" Alice is not a little girl but a full-grown woman with a rewarding career as a sea captain. The movie is bloated boring and overladen with special effects. And if you listen really closely you can hear the sound of Lewis Carroll in the next world throwing up. ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" is a sequel to Tim Burtons ""Alice in Wonderland"" and though its directed by James Bobin (""The Muppets"") it has the Burton look -- the murky interiors the garish costumes and the makeup thats somewhere between scary and comical like a nightmare about clowns. And of course it co-stars Johnny Depp who with skill and precision reprises his portrayal of the Hatter as a strange lisping weirdo. In ways both good and bad Depp is the most interesting thing about ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" His characterization is meticulous and eye-catching. Its clearly the product of much thought and investment and there are flickers of brilliance. And yet its like watching something that has been practiced and perfected in a mirror. Depp acts like someone with a strange unawareness that he must engage with the other actors. This is generally the problem with much (not all) of Depps recent work but its a particular problem for ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" because the screenwriters try to hang the entire story on Alices friendship with the Hatter. Early in the movie Alice (Mia Wasikowska) visits him and we see that hes a disconnected oddball. And yet she leaves the meeting with a bizarre determination to solve the Hatters problems. She must go back in time to save the Hatters family from the caprice and cruelty of the evil queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Consider this for a second. This is whats supposed to drive the story The audience is expected to invest in a life-and-death adventure to ensure the safety of characters we havent met -- and to preserve the friendship between Alice and a hat-wearing wack job. As youre reading this you cant possibly care. Viewers will care even less in the theater. The looking glass in this adaptation is not a dive into the unconscious but rather a means of time travel. Alice has to meet up with Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) steal a magic orb that turns into a time machine and then change the course of events. Curiously she has her transportation all taken care of -- youd think that would be the hard part -- but she has absolutely no idea what to do when she gets there. The movie has no idea either. Alice is like the movie itself frenetic and scrambling but with no thought or purpose. The screenplay is really just an excuse for visuals but without a purpose behind the visuals they quickly become as dull as a laser show or a computer screen saver. In the absence of anything substantial to cling to the movie tries to amuse with extraneous things. An exchange from Noel Cowards ""Private Lives"" is lifted verbatim and plopped into the script. Eduard Strauss ""Bahn Frei"" best known as the theme song to Jean Shepherds old radio show turns up as background music at a dinner party but slowed down and arranged for strings. And Carter as the queen carts out an imitation of Bette Davis that is very funny -- or would be in another context. But all of it is just whistling in a void.

If ever there was a filmmaker born to adapt Lewis Carrolls Alice stories Burton is it. And he tried he really did to bring us a wondrous work with his deeply flawed 2010 entry Alice in Wonderland. To hardcore Burton fans it wasnt good enough marred by (among other things) a ludicrous turn by Johnny Depp as a Mad Hatter more fit for Bedlam than Wonderland. But the picture made 1.025 billion convincing Walt Disney Studios it had the makings of a winning new franchise. Half a dozen years later we have the first sequel. And Im sorry to say that Alice Through the Looking Glass directed by relative newcomer James Bobin (The Muppets) is a dull formulaic theme-park ride whose only purpose is to make more pots of money. Looking Glass reunites most of the original cast incuding Mia Wasikowska as Alice Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter Anne Hathaway as the flighty White Queen and Helena Bonham Carter as the perpetually enraged Red Queen. They are joined by Sacha Baron Cohen as Time - yes Time the tick-tocking dude himself. For all its faults Burtons film was a painterly treat that used digital effects to create a rich textured world ripe for discovery. It was about a Victorian teen who gets to explore a fantastical new world where she meets exotic creatures and crazy characters. Looking Glass refigures Carrolls characters as action heroes plunging them into an absurd sci-fi adventure story right out of Doctor Who. You see Mad Hatter is going mad (even madder I guess) because hes convinced that his family who were supposedly killed by the Jabberwocky are still alive. Eager to help her friends Alice steals Times time machine so she can find out what really happened to Hatters kin. Cohen the films only bright spot delivers a wacky turn as a mildly mad deity in charge of making sure the temporal flow continues smoothly. Time travel would ruin everything hes built so he hops on another time machine and goes chasing after Alice. Looking Glass tries to simulate excitement by speeding up the action the music and the tempo and ratcheting up the CGI transforming the gorgeous tableaus created by Burton into a dizzying perpetual-motion onslaught. But behind all the chases and the battles in Alice Through the Looking Glass behind the conflicts and the bravado there beats a hollow heart. tirdadphillynews.com MOVIE REVIEW Alice Through the Looking Glass 1 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by James Bobin.

EntertainmentMovies Dull Alice Through the Looking Glass doesnt reflect Lewis Carrolls vision Originally published May 26 2016 at 1200 am Updated May 26 2016 at 143 pm Iracebeth the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) returns in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" (null) Movie review of ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" Colorful film is lovely to look at but could have used more quirk. Rating 2 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Curiouser and curiouser. The colorful live-action Disney film ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" coming six years after its predecessor ""Alice in Wonderland"" (directed by Tim Burton who wisely sat this one out) somehow manages to be at once chaotic and dull. Lovely to look at to be sure -- Colleen Atwoods costumes are exuberant perfection and the Mad Hatters adorably chapeau-shaped cottage made me want to move in immediately -- but dull. To paraphrase Lewis Carroll the movies running as fast as it can but still remains in the same place. Actually thats the problem right there not enough Carroll. Dont buy a ticket expecting to see a filmed version of Carrolls ""Through the Looking Glass And What Alice Found There"" (his 1871 sequel to ""Alices Adventures in Wonderland"" published six years earlier). The story here is mostly quite different a grown-up Alice (Mia Wasikowska) whos now captain of her fathers merchant ship heads through a looking glass back to Wonderland where she helps the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) reunite with his family and the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) to get in touch with her own origin story alongside a tick-tocking villain named Time (Sacha Baron Cohen). Surely I dont need to tell you that Bonham Carters wonderfully bigheaded queen is much more entertaining when shes yelling ""Off with her head"" than when reliving childhood trauma. Depps Hatter meanwhile has gotten so wispily weird Im not convinced hes actually there at all. (An actor lost in a role or a role lost in an actor? Carroll might appreciate the question.) Meanwhile Anne Hathaway reprises her amusing Glinda-the-Good-Witch take on the White Queen and the late Alan Rickmans voice -- as always smoother than cream -- graces us for the last time as the wise Caterpillar. ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" isnt without pleasures but this empowerment-meets-fantasy mixture could have used a few more sprinklings of quirk. Movie Review    Alice Through the Looking Glass  with Mia Wasikowska Johnny Depp Anne Hathaway Helena Bonham Carter Rhys Ifans Sacha Baron Cohen and the voices of Stephen Fry Alan Rickman Michael Sheen and Timothy Spall. Directed by James Bobin from a screenplay by Linda Woolverton. 112 minutes. Rated PG for fantasy action/peril and some language. Several theaters.

Share Tweet Disneys version of Tim Burtons version of Lewis Carrolls Alice In Wonderland made over a billion dollars worldwide back in 2010 a box office statistic that will forever vex those who mistook Burton spending a little too much time in his wheelhouse for some kind of crime against literature cinema and dance all at once. The truth is Carrolls work doesnt particularly lend itself to faithful adaptation and if Disneys new Alice series tries to fit his eccentricity into a fantasy-quest template theres still plenty of nonsense left to go around (if not nearly enough wordplay).Yes series Alice In Wonderland has been made into a sequel just as the original book was. Alice Through The Looking Glass bears if anything even less resemblance to its literary equivalent than did its predecessor (which itself was already a ""return to Wonderland"" narrative under a more familiar title). Almost the entire cast checks back in but Burton has moved to producing while James Bobin takes over as director. Bobins version of Wonderland (or Underland as everyone in the movie calls it) abandons Burtons water-damaged-psychedelia color palette for a brighter more verdant look. If the style is tweaked to fit the ending of the previous movie the technique is similar This is essentially an animated film with some live-action performers dropped in and digitally augmented in eye-catchingly bizarre ways.As ever Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is the stubborn voice of reason both in and out of Underland. The movie joins her as a sea captain in the late 19th century fulfilling the promise of independence and adventure made at the end of the previous film. She returns home to London to find that her life resembles well the setup to a sequel Hamish (Leo Bill) the grotesquely milquetoast suitor from the previous film turns up to further repress our heroine this time by forcing a financial choice between Alices ship and her mothers home. Just like in the first film Alice escapes Hamish at a snobby party by jumping over to Underland where she learns that the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) has sunk into a kind of dollhouse depression looking faded and fragile in his conviction that he must be reunited with his estranged presumed-dead family. To help the Hatter Alice steals a time-travel device from Time himself personified by Sacha Baron Cohen as a man-machine hybrid with an Eastern European accent.The adventure of Through The Looking Glass involves Alice zipping around the Underland timeline and makes several looking-glass trips in and out of the real world. Its briskly paced and sometimes neat to watch in reality-bending 3-D but none of it is quite as head-spinning as it should be. The movie doesnt dare alienate its family base with genuine trippiness; instead it pacifies with tedious familial backstory. Alices fantastic machine allows her to traverse time and space all to witness the lame origins of not just the Hatter but also the perpetually furious Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and the more sanguine White Queen (Anne Hathaway). This decision makes Underland feel very small indeed--especially when its the surreal mechanics of Time his clockwork lair and his little robotic helpers (the Seconds who can join forces and become Minutes and so on) that offer the most invention and amusement.Theres less of the latter than there should be considering that Bobins background is in comedy. He came to Disney via his direction of two hilarious Muppets movies yet his Alice is considerably less funny than Burtons less interested in whimsy for its own sake. Apart from the occasional visual tableau like a computer-generated dolly following the characters as they scramble through the Red Queens tree-based lair succumbing to its branches and traps Bobin downplays the farce and stays in fantasy maintenance mode. Most of the laughs come from the performers specifically Cohens brusqueness (""Keep your bewilderment brief and to the point"") and Carters cruel whims. Hathaways White Queen gets her share of screen time but with far fewer lines and almost none of the regal ridiculousness that made her such a delight in the previous film. Depp too is central to the story yet not given much to actually do. The famous faces are deployed like expensive special effects strategically with the assumption that lingering on them will become too expensive. Sometimes it feels like the supporting actors have lent their likeness rights rather than given full performances.Wasikowska remains a winning heroine even or especially when her Alice is making stubborn potentially wrongheaded decisions. Its so much fun to see her captaining a ship (complete with a hero-shot zoom intro) or escaping a sanitarium that the non-Wonderland portions of the movie threaten to overshadow the fantasy bits. But even if Disneys Bobins Burtons Carrolls Alice exacerbates the flaws of its predecessor its still more harmless than offensive. The Alice pictures represent a livelier retooling of a previously Disney-animated story than the companys more tasteful fairy-tale adaptations. Its just a shame that a second-tier Burton movie will apparently stand as the series most idiosyncratic entry.

Photo Credit Disney / Peter Mountain advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Alice Kingsleigh returns to Wonderland to help her friend the Hatter. CAST Mia Wasikowska Sacha Baron Cohen Johnny Depp Helena Bonham CarterRATED PG (some intense peril)LENGTH 153BOTTOM LINE Crisscrossing plots and unpleasant characters make this a fantasy youll want to escape. Depps simpering bug-eyed Hatter borders on horrifying. Whether you found 2010s ""Alice in Wonderland"" a delightfully trippy childrens fantasy or a garish mess built around yet another tic-driven performance by Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter one thing was clear Nobody but Tim Burton could have directed it. A filmmaker with an instantly identifiable Goth-pop sensibility Burton doesnt follow trends -- he is one. Theres little that feels original in James Bobins sequel ""Alice Through the Looking Glass."" It regroups most of the cast including the elegant Mia Wasikowska as our heroine Alice Kingsleigh but it cant replicate Burtons unique weirdness. Instead it borrows whatevers been trending through the culture of late with a bit of ""Wicked"" here some lip-service to girl power there plus a dash of steampunk and a dollop of fairy-tale darkness. The result owes less to Lewis Carrolls book about a self-confident little girl than to Mary Shelleys novel about a confused monster flailing its stitched-on limbs. advertisement | advertise on newsday The film opens with Alice in full maritime regalia commanding the all-male crew of a British vessel as it sails through a storm with pirates close behind. Its a whimsical start to this fantasy film but the scene turns out to be reality. Alice just 19 when we last saw her truly is a ships captain -- an astounding achievement in mid-19th-century England. What could another visit to Wonderland teach this preternaturally accomplished young woman? Video""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" trailerSUMMERS MUST-SEE MOVIES25 big movies out this summerCritics previewThe movies you have to see in 2016 Stepping through a mirror Alice -- and we -- must try to muster affection for Depps Hatter whose simpering affect and googly eyes (seemingly computer enlarged) have finally entered the realm of the horrifying. The Hatter is grieving for his dead family whom only Alice can rescue by traveling back in time. Make that Time personified by Sacha Baron Cohen as a bumbling grouch with a clockwork heart and a German accent. Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter return as the White and Red Queens respectively. Their sibling psychodrama involving a youthful lie and severe brain damage strikes an oddly dark note. All these characters seem ensnared by Linda Woolvertons spiderweb of a script while Bobins light comic touch on ""The Muppets"" is nowhere to be seen. ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" feels as cluttered as an old curiosity shop one filled with Burtons discarded odds and ends.

(Peter Mountain) But no this is a new adult adventurous liberated Alice -- who during a brief stop on dry land will venture back into Wonderland to help an ailing Mad Hatter face the Red Queen and even battle Time itself. Its a battle which her own movie loses. Disney releases Alice Through the Looking Glass trailer Managing to be both busy and boring director James Bobin keeps throwing things at us -- enormous sets antic chases ravenous monsters. At several points Alice even climbs into a sci-fi time machine and hurtles into the past. Theres plenty of eye candy. But its all distractions no delights. True Mia Wasikowska back as Alice is properly brave. If Sacha Baron Cohens Time isnt very funny at least his accent is. (Hes chosen to do the whole part mimicking das Werner Herzog ja?) Helena Bonham Carters Red Queen is the crowning achievement of the film. (Peter Mountain) And perfectly wonderful is Helena Bonham Carters returning Red Queen a foot-stamping tyrant with a noggin the size of a small planet. Helena Bonham Carter may return for Through the Looking Glass But stuck under a white wig and bristling black eyebrows poor Anne Hathaways White Queen can only flutter her hands and look concerned. As for the ginger-haired Johnny Depp as the loony Mad Hatter -- well hes a pale knockoff of Carrot Top. Whatever was magical about the story has been waved away replaced with scenes of bad business deals and misogynist doctors dysfunctional parents and childhood traumas. Hey what is this a bedtime story or ""Long Days Journey Into Night""? But in taking a nursery-school masterpiece apart -- putting Humpty Dumpty over there removing the White Knight and adding a lot of supposedly serious messages and emotions - the filmmakers have only ended up with something smaller than the sum of its parts. And all the studios horses and all the studios men cant put it back together again.

Courtesy of Disney A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The guiding principle of Lewis Carrolls classics Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass is that logic does not exist. You tumble down rabbit holes and into mirrors willy-nilly and you try to survive feeling what you feel having fun when you can -- oh and try not to drown the animals in your Pool of Tears. So adapting Carroll for blockbuster -- read formulaic -- movies is difficult. Frequent Disney scribe Linda Woolverton (Beauty and the Beast Maleficent) made an admirable effort with the script for Tim Burtons 2010 box-office hit Alice in Wonderland but despite Woolvertons attempt at reining it all in that movies a two-hour blender accident of Harry Potter-like characters splashed on the wall behind Johnny Depps creepy salivating Mad Hatter. Now shes written James Bobins shot at Carrolls classic Alice Through the Looking Glass which reunites some old favorite characters for a story that is unfortunately more dramatic -- more logical -- than it is whimsical.Mia Wasikowska returns as Alice helming her dead fathers ship the Wonder. In the first five minutes were treated to a thrilling chase sequence the crew surviving against all odds thanks to the ingenious and calculated efforts of our heroine. By all appearances this film feels like its going to seize the reins of the old Imagineering Disney mojo but the story squanders that with a rehash of Burtons film -- and by presenting Alice as selfish and annoyingly obstinate.Film Details Alice Through the Looking Glass RatingPG GenreAction/Adventure Running Time113 min. More Info Trailer When Alice returns to London she finds that her mother has sold their home and can only get it back if Alice sells the boat. As in Burtons film Alice doesnt want to be trapped -- a totally reasonable position and a comment on womens ""duties"" in Victorian England. But Alice lashes out at her mother not the guy who put her in that position. Bobin keeps the camera on Alice directing allegiances to her but her tantrum is irksome the kind of thing that might lead a kid to say ""Whys she so mean to her mommy?"" Alice doesnt stop to think that leaving her mother back home for years with no job or family might ya know make her pretty desperate for money? EXPAND Still all of that seems to set up a somewhat passable story Shes a faulty heroine who must learn the error of her ways. But when Absolem (the late great Alan Rickman) a caterpillar-cum-butterfly steals Alice away to Underland through a mirror she takes the selfishness to the next level.In Underland Mad Hatter (Depp) is all boo-hoo sad Hatter after finding a paper hat he made as a child. Hes convinced himself that his family is still alive and not a long-gone breakfast snack for the now-dead firebreather Jabberwocky. Alice decides shell go back in time to save his family. She steals something called a Chronosphere from Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) -- who is both the embodiment of time and like a guy -- so that she can time travel back to the Hatters past. Time gives her plenty of serious warnings of the dangers of this and she does it anyway putting the lives of everyone in Underworld on the line. Yeah Alice risks destroying an entire world because her friend is sad. And her idiot buddies -- Mirana (Anne Hathaway) Tweedledee/dum (Matt Lucas) Bayard (Timothy Spall) Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) etc. -- encourage her to do it.The last Alice movie had goofy rambunctious supporting characters cracking wise. Here they disappear pretty quickly their screentime filled in with convoluted plot. Baron Cohen fortunately is the saving grace of silly. As Time pursues Alice through an ocean of memories to get the Chronosphere back he delivers one-liners (""Time waits for no man"" ""Time is not on your side"") that are pun-funny apt for an Alice movie but do get a little old and tired as they go. Oh Time He does wear on. EXPAND Now Carroll wrote implausible illogical stories for the pleasure of them but a tentpole Disney movie must fit tidily into a heros-journey structure. Trying to make a movie whose fundamental basis is that things dont have to make sense just doesnt jibe with the precise story turns of a blockbuster arc. Still this story as Woolverton wrote it might have worked as a Carroll knockoff if it hadnt been for the tone which is really trying to hit home a moral lesson through drama. Thats antithetical to the whole spirit of Carrolls work and the two are forever at odds here with neither the moral lesson nor the nonsensical elements getting the time to coalesce into something either meaningful or memorably wacky.This all might have been funny and weird in the way the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was. Its certainly a visual delight with the kind of Technicolor out-of-this-world design only Disney could produce. Its so gorgeous you can sometimes forget the train wreck of a story. But only sometimes. Worst of all this is Alan Rickmans last film and his caterpillar/butterfly only has a few measly lines. Thats worth a Pool of Tears.

VPCMia Wasikowska and Johnny Depp star in Alice Through the Looking Glass.(Photo Peter Mountain) 157 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORETime isnt on the side of Alice Through the Looking Glass.Six years after Tim Burton put a trippy spin on Alice in Wonderland the mediocre sequel (1/2 out of four; rated PG; in theaters Friday) matches the originals hypercolor palette and insane visuals though it cant cobble together an equally engaging plot or even a coherent one. Looking Glass is instead a competition to see how goofy Johnny Depp can be as the Mad Hatter and how many scenes (and hearts) Helena Bonham Carter can steal as the ragingly high-maintenance Red Queen.Oh yeah Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is in this too though shes overshadowed by even Humpty Dumptys shattered pieces in the follow-up directed by James Bobin (The Muppets). Years removed from her first adventure in Wonderland Alice is now a sea captain who has traveled the globe only to find herself in jeopardy of losing her home and vessel upon her return to London.USA TODAYDisney sees dollar signs in Alice live-action remakesThat subplot gets put on the Victorian shelf as soon as the caterpillar-turned-butterfly Absolem (voiced by the late Alan Rickman) leads her to a transporting Looking Glass and a way back to a magical world where chess pieces seem more alive than Anne Hathaways White Queen.Alices pal Mad Hatter is actually Sad Hatter -- hes dying but finds a clue that his family might not have died in an inferno caused by the Jabberwocky. Alice hijacks a time-traveling Chronosphere from Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) an eccentric guy with a penchant for clockwork chic but every time she uses it she destroys the Grand Clock a little more.Linda Woolvertons script is filled with time cliches and painful puns -- the Mad Hatter calling one of the Red Queens vegetable minions ""absolutely radishing"" is particularly abhorrent. Worse the plot presents Alice as an accidental antagonist of sorts since her selfish decisions lead to many of the obstacles she faces.USA TODAYDisney teases us all with its first Beauty and the Beast trailerShe definitely has a gentle nature when it comes to the Hatter and Depp takes him to a nonsensical level in Looking Glass. The character who most balances wacky and grounded aspects is Time -- Cohen pumps the brakes on his usual over-the-top tendencies and turns him into one of the films few wise men. Time also gets the coolest special effects with his steampunk-influenced sidekicks and fantastical gear-filled kingdom.He also has a girlfriend of sorts with the big-headed Red Queen. Carter is phenomenal as the quasi-villainess who gets an origin story and owns every moment shes on screen. From the heart-shaped lipstick to the occasional ""Off with his/her/their head"" shouts shes a bright spot in a Wonderland missing wonder.While Alice yearns to do ""six impossible things before breakfast"" crafting a satisfying sequel is not in the cards. In the end it suffers from the same downfall as Disneys live-action The Jungle Book with style burying substance. Unless a Red Queen road trip is on tap next it might be time to retire the Looking Glasses for a while. 157 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1Vi8hNL",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/05/25/review-alice-through-the-looking-glass-movie/84844108/,200,ali27,ali,usatoday
"Review Alice Through the Looking Glass a curiously uninspired sequel - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Alice Through the Looking Glass a curiously uninspired sequelBy Lindsey Bahr Associated PressPosted 05/24/2016 022649 PM PDTUpdated 05/25/2016 081103 PM PDT Like its 2010 predecessor ""Alice in Wonderland"" the new ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" owes very little to Lewis Carroll. And if youre thinking the six-year gap between films and the absence of Tim Burton as director might have allowed for a return to more of the gleeful absurdity of Carrolls originals well they havent. Screenwriter Linda Woolverton (""Beauty and the Beast"") again moves away from the source material in favor of something more linear -- a story about Alice (Mia Wasikowska) searching for the family of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). This film directed by James Bobin (""The Muppets"") trudges on through the lushly designed world of the earlier movie to find answers to questions such as ""What was the Mad Hatters childhood like?"" and ""Why does the Red Queen have such a large head?"" In other words its an origin story. Helena Bonham Carter as Iracebeth the Red Queen in Alice Through the Looking Glass. (Peter Mountain/Disney) This time we meet Alice when she is again faced with the prospect of losing her independence. Last time she was fleeing a marriage proposal. This time her livelihood -- as a sea captain a good one -- is in jeopardy. So when her life in the real world turns frustrating she steps through a mirror and is transported back to Underland where her old friends want her to fix another problem the Hatter.This nightmarish character -- who now has combed hair a sicklier pallor a grown-up wardrobe and a more pronounced lisp -- is suffering from a life-threatening case of depression which came on when he discovered an object that makes him think his family is alive.Advertisement Alice tries to be a noble friend by taking on Time to get to the bottom of what happened on the day the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) unleashed her Jabberwocky on their village.Time -- who is part clock part man and sounds a lot like Werner Herzog -- is played by Sasha Baron Cohen. The sequences with him and his little steampunk companions are actually high points in the film since they allow Bobin to get out from under Burtons suffocating precedents.Time talks a big game and he can determine when someones time has elapsed. But hes dependent on a larger-than-life clock that in turn is powered by a time-travel machine. So Alice steals this machine to careen into the past and attempt to correct the original sins of Underland even after learning that her actions might trigger a catastrophe.If all this sounds intriguing on the screen it becomes less compelling as it goes along. While Depp descends into grating ghoulishness the acting of the other returning characters remains much the same as before. Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway (the White Queen) do more of their scenery-chewing shticks. And the Underland creatures look increasingly dated because Burtons CGI renderings from six years ago have been reused.Some of the visuals are truly inspired however including a landscape of glimmering pocket watches suspended in air. But many of the set pieces are overly elaborate including the one where Alice must walk across the enormous hands of a ticking clock to get inside Times headquarters. Excitement and wonder are tough to conjure when the Mad Hatter is consumed with daddy issues but nonchalant about everything else and when scientific explanations for the oddities of Underland suggest things here were once boringly ordinary. Thats a shame since the Alice stories could be so wonderful on the big screen. Maybe its time for Disney to scrap all this and start again.

Mia Wasikowska returns as the eminently sensible Alice who has been adventuring on the high seas since we last saw her (a little anachronistically considering this is the 1800s). Now she must battle male chauvinism to follow her dreams back on dry land. The story bears little relation to Lewis Carrolls novel. Instead screenwriter Linda Woolverton aims for a sequel that also serves as a prequel with plenty of flashbacks to the past lives of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Its Alices job after tumbling through the mirror and returning to Underland to negotiate with a brand new character volatile almost-villain Time (Sacha Baron Cohen on high-camp slightly grating form) to save Hatter whos dying from a broken heart. The films pace barely leaves you time to think - blink and youll lose the plot. But theres plenty of imagination here to honour the spirit of Carrolls topsy-turvy tales even if the emotional resolutions are of a distinctly twenty-first-century sort.

What can I say I was mesmerised and blown away. I couldnt take my eyes off the screen. I was truly taken away by the cast who individually did a brilliant role. For me Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen was everything I imagined to be the make up costume and special effects are exquisite. I went into this world and it was designed to perfection. The whole crew were a dream and its so worth to go and see. It was fascinating to see how they managed to twist the story and make this film very connected to the first film Alice In Wonderland. Thank you Tim Burton for your existence I am incredibly inspired by your films. True innovator Always believe in the impossible things. TOTastemaker Love MD.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore19 hours agoZoe FFeaturedI have a confession I havent read the books by Lewis Carroll so admittedly am only familiar with Alice In Wonderland in the sense of what Disney have given me to go on. I can say I do like the 1951 animated classic but am far less struck on the adaptations by Tim Burton and co.I have seen the 1st in the series in the cinema when it was released and remember finding it somewhat enjoyable but not enough to make me want to buy the DVD to rewatch. So this wasnt a sequal I was particularly asking for but nevertheless agreed to go with friends who wanted to see it.The best words I would use would to discribe it be underwhelming and unecessary.Sure it had its funny moments and is visually well done. I did like the concept of ""time"" being a person and Sasha Baron Cohens portrayal of this. I have to say one of the best moments for me is probably hearing the distinctive voice of Alan Rickmans as Absolem the Caterpillar in his final film role this would put a smile of anyones face right?But as far as the storyline is concerned it all just kind of seemed a bit pointless and not engaging for me personally. Unfortunately I did found it lacking the edge to stike the chord with me and I would not suggest going out of your way to see it - that said it may be better in 3D and with children.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMore4 days agoNatalie OFeaturedMy mind was blown by the special effects in this film It was so Tim Burton Johnny depp played the role of the hatter superbly again.

Perhaps Disney was giving audiences a reprieve or perhaps they were just allowing us enough time to forget how unpleasant the first film was plying us with quality in the meantime. ""Here have a good new Star Wars movie. Enjoy The Jungle Book. Pay no mind to the ominous storm clouds that are gathering above the worlds multiplexes. Relax it will all be over soon."" READ MORE Alice Through the Looking Glass Sneak Peek Trippy Time-Warping Disney Sequel (New Photos Trailer) Of course the real reason why six years have elapsed since the release of the first movie is that ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a singular work childrens literature and Lewis Carrolls follow-up novel is so bonkers and beautiful that it would sooner lend itself to the acid-warped visions of Alejandro Jodoworsky than it would the disembodied corporate ethos of Walt Disney. Screenwriter Linda Woolverton was tasked with taking a book that Suzanne Todd describes as ""essentially an allegory of a chess match and a bunch of random and bizarre episodes from Carolls life which dont bear any relation to one another"" and bending it into a piece of family entertainment that can play in China. On the one hand Lewis Carroll is the Thomas Pynchon of young adult literature and ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" is his ""Gravitys Rainbow."" On the other hand... money. Helmed by ""The Muppets"" director James Bobin ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" begins with the flaxen-haired heroine (a contractually obligated Mia Wasikowska) returning to civilization after a successful stint as the captain of a sailing vessel. Stepping on to dry land Alice discovers that Victorian England is not the most hospitable place for a young woman of grand ambition and fierce potential. Doofy aristocrat Hamish Ascot (Leo Bill) still bitter about how Alice rebuffed his marriage proposal in the previous film puts the kibosh on the girls maritime career and essentially forces her to choose between working in his mailroom or giving up her mothers house. Frustrated by the grim realities of adult life Alice once again retreats into her imagination following a familiar blue butterfly as it flutters into a mirror in a back room of Hamishs mansion. As fans of the first film could tell you if they existed this luminous insect is Absolem and -- for his brief appearance -- hes voiced by the late Alan Rickman in his final performance. Its a tragic way for one of the greats to say goodbye tragic enough that ignoring this movie entirely could be construed as a respectful tribute. Alice follows Absolem through the liquid surface of the looking glass and finds herself back in the psychedelic hellscape of Underland. Yay. Once again located somewhere between Narnia and ""Jacobs Ladder"" Underland hasnt changed much since the last time we saw it. The place is still a garish kingdom of nightmares like a server full of CG imagery melted onto the screen. If the Mad Hatter has lost much of his muchness then the realm in which he lives still possesses much too much of it. Gaspar Noe can only dream of creating such a perfect vision of hell. And poor James Bobin whos powerless to fight back. Woe to the people who agree to direct the sequel to a Tim Burton movie painted into a corner of bug-eyed gothic maximalism. Remember ""Batman Forever""? Joel Schumacher tried to wiggle free from the groundwork of Burtons aesthetic but was ultimately unable to escape. For Bobin the situation is even more grim as this particular film world is its aesthetic. Worse still its inhabitants -- which include some of the most unappealing characters ever projected onto a movie screen -- are a direct outgrowth of their environment. Wasikowska is a stubbornly compelling talent even in the worst of circumstances but even she cant save this franchise from yet another story that reduces Alice to less of a character than she is a tour guide through a miserable world and a friend to every member of its noxious population. And thats exactly what ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" asks Alice to do as Woolvertons script plunges its heroine deep into the folds of Underland quickly severing any connection between her dreamland adventures and the real world problems from which shes escaping. The gist of this senseless plot is that the Mad Hatter... you know what? It really doesnt matter. Hes sad and Alice needs to go back in time to make him less sad. In order to do that she must visit Time himself (Sacha Baron Cohen as a humanoid clock) a refreshingly conflicted antagonist who is part Grim Reaper and part cosmic architect. From him Alice nabs a device called the Chronosphere which allows her to pop into the past and prevent the moment in which a teenage Hatter sparked the feud between the Red Queen (an overcooked Helena Bonham Carter) and her angelic sister (an inarguably sentient Anne Hathaway) and doomed his own family. READ MORE Watch Its Time For More Madness With The First Trailer For Alice Through The Looking Glass With Johnny Depp amp; More Remember in ""Alice in Wonderland"" when Alice said ""Its no use going back to yesterday because I was a different person then?"" Well she appears to have forgotten. Its a shame as her attempts to change the past only result in more trouble -- ""Through the Looking Glass"" subscribes to the fatalistic ""La Jetee"" logic of time travel which means that Alice only burrows further down the rabbit hole with every good deed. But that the film subscribes to any logic is part of its problem as everything about Carrolls creation exists in defiance of a ""proper"" restrictive order. As Alice runs from one hollow set piece to another hitting every standard mark that a colossal movie like this must in order to pay for itself her adventure grows less and less interesting with every turn. By the end all that lessness is too much for the muchness to match it. Less is usually more but when it comes to this franchise none would be ideal.

TWITTER 5/27/2016 Mia Wasikowskas feisty Alice must time-travel to save Johnny Depps Mad Hatter in James Bobins sequel to the 2010 Tim Burton film. ""Poor poor little Alice"" the critic G.K. Chesterton lamented of Lewis Carrolls most famous character. ""She has not only been caught and made to do lessons; she has been forced to inflict lessons on others."" He was talking not about her Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass but about the meanings and ideas that had been assigned to her in the decades since the nonsense classics publication. And so the repurposing goes with the latest big-screen iteration a clunky composite of visual extravagance and Hollywood commonplaces about a life well lived. A sequel to Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland the James Bobin-directed feature is just as overstuffed a phantasmagoria of CGI and makeup as the 2010 film. Its imagery can be striking or merely distracting yet rarely transporting. Bypassing child-friendly charm for backstory psychology its dreamscape is weighted with yadda-yadda-yadda about being true to yourself honoring family and being loyal to friends. But theres no question that the Johnny Depp-starring spectacle going out in an assortment of 3D formats will like its billion-dollar-grossing predecessor attract fans worldwide. As Alice Through the Looking Glass kicks off its message-laden adventure the title character (Mia Wasikowska) is a brave and capable ships captain. Back in London but eager to return to the frothy fray she learns shes facing foreclosure on her vessel thanks to a bit of desperate deal-making by her mother (Lindsay Duncan) with the spiteful upper-class twit (Leo Bill) whose marriage proposal Alice rejected. Putting aside the matter of her colonialist exploits Wasikowskas Alice Kingsleigh is a convention-defying self-actualized Victorian female. But in case we havent appreciated the depths of her fortitude and accomplishment Linda Woolvertons screenplay informs us that the word ""impossible"" is anathema to Alice. Colleen Atwoods splendid jewel-bright outfits reflect her travels through China and emphasize her worldliness against the conformity of London society. But though Alices beloved ship is rather pointedly named The Wonder the movie offers only a paucity of the same. Woolverton whose revisionist reading of a femme-centric fairy tale had a potent intensity in Maleficent here puts her heroine on a time-traveling quest to rewrite history. At stake is the very survival of Alices friend the Mad Hatter (Depp) whos dying of depression and regret over his missing family the specifics of their fate a tormenting mystery for him. Depp is convincingly vulnerable and forlorn all while maintaining the Hatters otherworldly eccentricity and Wasikowska has the requisite grit. But Alices mission feels as manufactured as the storys whatsits and doodads as Bobin struggles to infuse make-believe with emotion (something he managed winningly within the comic realm of The Muppets). The story which has nothing to do with Carrolls episodic 1871 book beyond its title and a clutch of key characters plays out as a blenderized mix of standard fantasy action and Burtonesque Gothic-alia. Its other key ingredients a Wicked-reminiscent look at the roots of sibling rivalry and unpersuasive reminders that theres no place like home. Leading Alice away from home and back to Underland is the films fleeting glimpse of ethereal playfulness the former caterpillar Absolem now a blue butterfly voiced with plummy richness by the late Alan Rickman (to whom the picture is dedicated). Other returning Brits deliver fine voice work as well Matt Lucas as the rhyming Tweedles Stephen Fry (Cheshire Cat) Michael Sheen (White Rabbit) Timothy Spall (Bayard the bloodhound) Barbara Windsor (Dormouse) and Paul Whitehouse (March Hare). But center stage or a good part of it belongs to the psychodrama between the warring queens played again by Anne Hathaway in frosty pallor and Helena Bonham Carter a magnificent amalgam of digitally enhanced malevolence and wounded inner child. Her irascible Iracebeth better known as the Red Queen has a new ally this time around Time himself played by Sacha Baron Cohen (who worked with Bobin on Da Ali G Show). A sort of grim reaper with an Austrian accent -- or is he channeling Christoph Waltz? -- Time has ice-blue eyes a man bun and a skull filled with clock workings. Besides his Transformer-ish goons his underlings include a collection of anthropomorphized metal contraptions led by the mustachioed Wilkins (Matt Vogel). That these small clanking employees are Times ""seconds"" is a nice bit of wordplay and along with Times thesaural speech its one of the movies few nods to Carrolls inventive infatuation with language. But these conceits like so much of the films details get lost in the exhausting race against um Time. At the center of Times gloomy castle is the Chronosphere a thingamajig that will take Alice back to the Mad Hatters childhood where she hopes to undo the disastrous events that aggrieve him. The Red Queen has her own reasons for wanting the gadget -- world control naturally but also a deep-seated need to right a primal wrong from her own childhood. The hopping across years reveals all-too-obvious parallels among the three narrative strands the Red Queens grudge the conflict between Alice and her security-minded mother and the Mad Hatters despair over his father (Rhys Ifans) who didnt appreciate his singular sensibility. Amid the frenetic back-and-forth theres plenty to admire if not be truly wowed by in the whiz-bang effects work and the robust production design by Dan Hennah (The Hobbit). Stuart Dryburghs cinematography showcases the exuberance of the sets and costumes with palettes that range from stygian to dazzling. If only the sensory overload were hallucinatory or simply less fettered and more fun. One of the few affecting elements amid the would-be whimsy involves a childs handmade creation -- the kind of imperfect idiosyncratic beauty that the movie argues for but doesnt achieve. Like the Chronosphere that powers much of its action Through the Looking Glass is the stuff of revved-up mechanics not magic.

So wrote Lewis Carroll in the introduction to ""Alices Adventures Under Ground"" and his advice goes sadly unheeded in ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" James Bobins sequel to Tim Burtons massively lucrative ""Alice in Wonderland."" Taking Carrolls anything-goes psychedelic setting and painting it over with a drab time-travel plot and thoroughly beige origin stories for otherwise colorful characters this lackluster go-round is a mercenary backward step for Disneys live-action excavations of its animated back catalog which enjoyed a mighty leap forward only a few weeks ago with Jon Favreaus ""The Jungle Book."" Though its unlikely to equal the billion-dollar-plus worldwide tally of its 2010 predecessor ""Looking Glass"" should fare well enough commercially thanks to its day-glow production design busy CGI and assorted other shiny things. But as Carroll himself put it ""its a poor sort of memory that only works backwards."" While he cant really offer a substitute for the dark wit that Burton brings even to his lesser outings new director Bobin is hardly out of his element. As demonstrated in his first two ""Muppets"" features hes got fine comic timing and his ability to handle nonstop digital spectacle keeps ""Alice"" visually consistent and coherent even as it offers one spread of eye-candy after another. The problem with ""Alice"" is its lack of narrative imagination. For example in Disneys first animated crack at the tale back in 1951 the Mad Hatters madness existed a priori; like his famous riddle ""why is a raven like a writing desk?"" the point was that it has no solution. Yet ""Alice"" assumes we need the most literal of answers retconning a whole parallel world distinguished precisely by its lack of logic and forcing it to comply with the most shopworn of templates. (Yet paradoxically the plot is still often hard to follow.) The Mad Hatter as in the last installment is played by Johnny Depp with a shock of orange hair clown makeup and pupils dilated to psilocybic proportions. Though his Wonderland home has been peaceful since the banishment of the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) hes nonetheless fallen into a deep funk struggling to deal with lingering Oedipal issues and the death of his family in an unfortunate Jabberwocky incident. To the rescue eventually comes Alice Kinsleigh (Mia Wasikowska). When we first meet back up with our twentysomething heroine shes in command of a ship pursued by pirates. It initially scans as a dream sequence with Alice employing some Tony Hawk nautical strategies to evade her pursuers but this is indeed the real world As hinted at the end of the previous film Alice has been carving out trade routes to China as a sort of girl-power colonialist on her ship the Wonder only to arrive back home in London to face some difficult real-estate negotiations with her foppish former suitor Hamish (Leo Bill). Fortunately this real-world framing doesnt take up too much time and Alice soon slips through a mirror into Wonderland reuniting with old friends Tweedledee/Tweedledum (Matt Lucas) the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen) the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway). Theyre all worried about the depressed Hatter and the White Queen dispatches Alice to travel back into the past to save his family. To unstick herself from time Alice has to steal a steampunky gyroscope contraption called the Chronosphere from its owner Time itself (a mugging mustachioed Sacha Baron Cohen). Occupying the films best new setting (a giant clock) and outfitted with its best new costume (including a giant clock breastplate) Time is a hulking German-accented taskmaster in command of a slew of bumbling brass minions who combine to form terrifying robotic henchmen when trouble arises. (Cribbing from the ""Transformers"" franchise is rarely a good look yet here we are.) The banished Red Queen is busy trying to sweet-talk her way to the Chronosphere as well but Alice gets hold of it first and meets up with progressively younger versions of the Hatter and his disapproving father (Rhys Ifans) as she time-travels. The young Red Queen is here in the past as well and we get to see the origins of her evil her catchphrase and her giant head - none of them remotely worth the trouble. Theres nothing technically wrong with the film. The computer effects are loud and occasionally obnoxious yet skillfully designed; Colleen Atwoods costumes are lavish; and most of the performances (especially Hathaways dizzy White Queen) chew just the right amount of scenery. The question is simply why given the wealth of possibilities in Carrolls works would you tell a story inspired more by ""Back to the Future II"" and Burtons least successful additions to ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory""? Or for that matter ""Return to Oz."" In this films wildest derivation from the tone of the source material we see Alice thrust back into the real world strapped to a bed in a Victorian insane asylum. Even after she escapes shes still faced with a Sophies choice In order to save her familys home she must sell her prized ship. ""Sign over the Wonder"" she gasps ""and give up the impossible?"" Alas that ship has already sailed. Film Review Alice Through the Looking GlassReviewed at DGA Theater Los Angeles April 29 2016. MPAA rating PG. Running time 113 MIN.

Beth says June 24 2016 at 318 pm I was very disappointed by movie actually boring. 3d was a waste as the effects sucked. Not even close to as good as the book. Not movie theater worthy. Reply EricJ says May 10 2016 at 953 pm So Tim Burton -didnt- direct this and we STILL get ""Daddy didnt want me to be different""? Jim you dont have to imitate him that much Reply Jayden Leonard says May 11 2016 at 725 am Were still gonna be talking about some stuff Tims actually directed in a few months when Miss Peregrines Home For Peculiar Children drops. Reply crossie says May 10 2016 at 855 pm What did Disneys troubles with Infinity mean they had to skip the reviewer bribes this time around? Reply charles says May 10 2016 at 851 pm Alice in Wonderland while not great is not as bad as Batman v Superman. Alice Through the Looking Glass is likely still better than BvS. Reply Nick says May 10 2016 at 846 pm Do films like this have to be so freaking UGLY and UNAPPEALING to look at? Doesnt Disney even actually employee ARTISTS any more? How sad. Reply Jacques Strappe says May 10 2016 at 817 pm Oh well Disney has a clunker that will probably rival Batman vs Superman for a bottom feeding Rotten Tomatoes score but their mega hits outnumber the stinkers. When I saw the previews for this new Alice I suspected it was going to be like watching someone overdose on CGI. Depp seems to have lost his box office mojo in the past few years. Reply Goll says May 10 2016 at 1000 pm Black Mass did well because of Depp. Reply EricJ says May 10 2016 at 519 pm Linda Woolvertons Alice scripts read like she assembled them out of scrambling a set of Lewis Carroll Refrigerator Magnets ""And then the (Red Queen) sat on her (pig) (footstool) and accused the (frog footman) of (stealing the tarts)"" Here she remembered chess pieces and Humpty Dumpty were in the second book and Hatter mentioning ""Time is a Him"" from the first book and...scrambled away. Reply Marc says May 10 2016 at 1122 pm Everything shes ever ""written"" is remainders of regurgitated scrambles. Reply Marci says May 15 2016 at 1259 pm Ask anyone who worked on Beauty and the Beast and theyll tell you the screenplay was written but he storyboard artists FAR more than linda wolverton.... EricJ says May 11 2016 at 959 am Beauty and the Beast? The one that psychotically ignored the original tale and turned it into another persecuted-feminist fantasy where Belle was the only female in town smart enough to read? Yeahhh THINK that was the same writer who put Alice in Joan of Arc armor and made her the Pirate Queen. Jayden Leonard says May 11 2016 at 732 am You know she did the screenplay for Beauty and the Beast right? cadavra says May 10 2016 at 412 pm This is nothing new. Films back in the old days gave audiences credit for being intelligent enough to follow along. Today e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g h-a-s t-o b-e s-p-e-l-l-e-d o-u-t. And the dumbing down of America continues apace. Reply nobody important says May 10 2016 at 418 pm crap films have always existed. wizard of oz is proof of that. Reply cadavra says May 10 2016 at 427 pm You mean the 1939 MGM version? Good luck finding people who agree with that.

The Mad Hatter-haired fantasist seemed like a perfectly surreal match for 2010s Alice in Wonderland the umpteenth cinematic adaptation of Lewis Carrolls curiouser-and-curiouser classic. And in some ways he was The film grossed a staggering 1 billion worldwide and won two Oscars (for Art Direction and Costume Design) though some critics felt there was too little actual wonder beneath all its brain-whomping visual dazzle. Burton is billed as a producer on the sequel but now hes passed the directing reins to James Bobin (Da Ali G Show Flight of the Concords both recent big-screen Muppets reboots). Not that youll necessarily notice. For better or worse Looking Glass loses none of the first films muchness with Bobin mimicking both his predecessors wildly saturated style and his general disregard for plot and substance. (Though he does cast Da G himself Sasha Baron Cohen in a major supporting role as Time personified.) As the story opens Alice (Mia Wasikowska still the fairest of them all; literally the girl looks like shes made of porcelain) has just returned from three years on the high seas and is already giddy with plans for her next adventure. But back in England she finds that her former would-be fiance Hamish (the excellently squirrelly Leo Bill) has taken her dead fathers ship out from under her commandeered the sale of her mothers home and is trying to railroad Alice herself into a lowly clerk position at his company. Still shell-shocked she is visited by her old friend Blue Caterpillar (the late Alan Rickman in his final speaking role) who tells her she is urgently needed -- ""Youve been gone too long Alice. There are matters which might benefit from your attention"" -- and so she steps through the glass and tumbles down once more. The pressing issue is the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp); hes dying apparently of a broken heart. The only solution according to the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) is to go back to the past and help him recover the family he lost years ago most likely due to the homicidal whims of her sister the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Enter Time (Baron Cohen) who is not exactly open to loaning out his Chronosphere -- an electricity-conducting brass ball that looks like an old-timey compass and operates like a tiny spherical DeLorean. But Alice steals it anyway whirling back through the years to find out where it all went wrong. Thats more than enough intrigue for 108 minutes but the movie feels oddly static and more than a little airless. Its not the actors fault Depp grimaces and prances in his mad Scottish-kabuki drag Hathaway flutters like a glittery sparrow and Bonham Carter brings bite and pathos to her Red Queen. (She hates because she hurts.) She and Baron Cohen both have some great lines though Wasikowska our supposed heroine isnt allowed to do much more than furrow her brow prettily and play a very 21st century take on 19th-century pluck. We get small doses of most of the novels most beloved characters too our White Rabbit and grinning Cat and the Tweedles Dee and Dum. And the film is a feast to look at even if it sometimes feel like youll get gout in your eyeballs from the overwhelming CGI lushness of it all. It may just be that despite the epicness of Alices quest the stakes feel low because the outcome itself never seems in question; of course loved ones will be reunited and good will ultimately triumph over evil even in Wonderlands topsy-turvy world. We can still lose ourselves in the extraordinary ""unpossible"" of Lewis imagination -- but Lookings story and our emotional engagement stay behind the glass.

There is perhaps no math nor pie chart to prove this but just because certain movies become big hits it doesnt mean that anyone is clamoring for a sequel. Whatever perfect storm of inducements got people to buy tickets for ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" didnt bring them back to theaters for ""The Huntsman Winters War"" and lets not even get into the ""Avatar"" saga that James Cameron seems to believe the world is breathlessly awaiting. Speaking of ""Avatar"" it was mainly on that films 3-D coattails that Tim Burtons ""Alice in Wonderland"" became such a huge hit although that noisy jumbled 2010 film was a success along the lines of the ""Macarena"" dance craze -- very popular for a brief moment but now its hard to find anyone who will cop to having been a fan. See Video Alices Time Is Up in New Alice Through the Looking Glass TV Spot Nonetheless Disneys accounting department has demanded a follow-up and so six years later here comes ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" a sequel that improves on the previous film -- but honestly what wouldnt? The visuals seem less muddled (the film was screened for trade press in 2D) and the plot isnt just an excuse to stick another sword into the hand of another fairytale character but its still a bright and shiny jumble of effects attempting to cover up the utter lack of interesting characters. James Bobin (""Muppets Most Wanted"") slips into Burtons directors chair borrowing not only his predecessors penchant for over-the-top stylization but also Burtons affection for ""daddy didnt understand me"" narratives. If you liked the misunderstood man-children of ""Big Fish"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" now you get the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) lamenting that his father didnt care for his outrageous taste in chapeau couture. See Video Johnny Depp Mocks Australia Dog-Smuggling Apology For her part Alice (Mia Wasikowska) has been quite happy in the real world of 1875 sailing the globe as a sea captain. (Shes so well-scrubbed and sprightly youd be forgiven for thinking the early scenes of her ordering around a crew and saving her ship from pirates was an elaborate fantasy. But no.) Upon returning home she discovers that her mother (Lindsay Duncan) has mortgaged the family estate and that Alices piggish former fiance Lord Ascot (Leo Bill) plans to foreclose either the ship or the house. Attending a party at Lord Ascots Alice sees a blue butterfly (voiced by the late Alan Rickman) who leads her to a looking glass that brings her back to Underland (this series insists that Lewis Carrolls Alice heard the name wrong) on a new mission -- cheering up the Mad Hatter (Depp) who is convinced that his family perhaps did not die at the hands of the monstrous Jabberwock after all. Making things right will involve stealing a time-travel device from Time (Sasha Baron Cohen) himself; Alices quest is complicated by the fact that Times girlfriend the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) has her own time-travel plans. Screenwriter Linda Woolverton delivers the ""you cant change the past you can only fix the present"" homily with the subtlety of a walrus and a carpenter tied to a 10-ton rock and she borrows a little from ""Wicked"" for good measure Is the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) as good and kind as her reputation? Does the Red Queen perhaps have some reason to resent her? Also Read Weinstein Company Takes U.S. Rights to Nazi Thriller HHhH The visual effects are a glorious smorgasbord of cutting-edge technology which is about as much as I can say about them because full disclosure Jay Redd -- who shares a visual effects supervisor credit with the legendary Ken Ralston (""Star Wars A New Hope"") -- is a friend. What ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" constantly underscores however is that even the greatest cinema trickery serves little purpose without stories and characters to support. The pictures are pretty (or scary or awe-inspiring) but they ultimately dont mean anything. Wasikowska does what she can in a role that forces her to be the straight man to a passel of lunatic humans and talking animals and Baron Cohen at least makes the plethora of time-related puns go down easier by delivering all his lines in a flawless Werner Herzog impersonation. Depp does what Depp does -- as comedian Alec Mapa once noted in movies like this were basically paying to watch him go trick-or-treating -- but its the bombastic Bonham Carter who steals the show only partially because these movies make me want to scream as well. Email 13 Other Dark Disney Moments Before Jungle Book (Photos) ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" (1937)First Snow White gets lured into the woods by a huntsman who wants to kill her but he shows mercy. However the scary moments arent over as she walks through the terrifying forest which becomes hostile towards her. Obviously the whole Evil Queen thing is incredibly dark and sinister as well as she tries to poison Snow White out of jealousy.Disney""Pinocchio"" (1940)Well Pinocchios punishment for being a bad boy is to be turned partially into a donkey or a literal jackass. Also his father got swallowed by a gigantic whale so Pinocchio goes to rescue him and also dives into Monstros mouth. Disney""Fantasia"" (1940)""Fantasia"" sets itself apart from all other Disney movies as it mashes together animation and famous classical music. However at one point a demon named Chernabog sits on top of a mountain and sends ghosts and unearthly creatures to the village below. Horrifying.Disney ""Bambi"" (1942)We all know this tear-jerker scene in which Bambi goes on a stroll with his mother when she senses a hunter nearby. Her instincts prove correct and soon shots ring out killing the mother and leaving Bambi to call out for his mom. Disney""Alice in Wonderland"" (1951)Many theorists have claimed that Alices journey to Wonderland actually represents a trip on acid and many have theorized that the movie is about drugs. Whatever the truth is all the characters she meets are downright dark and scary especially the Queen of Hearts.Disney""Escape to Witch Mountain"" (1975)Two orphans who have psychic/telekinetic powers get chased by a millionaire forcing them to go to Witch Mountain to find their ""true"" family. Scary stuff for young or sensitive kids. Theres even a flashback in which someone drowns.Disney""Return to Oz"" (1985)This film was actually criticized for being too dark and terrifying for children. The fantasy film has Dorothy getting electroshock therapy at the beginning and the characters of the mental institution present themselves in the World of Oz. All in all Dorothy explores some scary places.Disney""The Black Cauldron"" (1985)This movie became the first Disney animated film to receive a PG rating. An evil Horned King seeks to obtain a magical Black Cauldron in the hope to enslave the rest of the world -- the King himself is a figure with a skeletal body glowing red eyes and a terrifying voice.  Disney ""The Jungle Book"" (1994)This first attempt to bring a live action Mowgli to the screen featured Cary Elwes getting devoured by a giant python.Disney""The Lion King"" (1994)One of the most famous moments in Disney history is when Scar kills Mufasa while Simba is watching. The most heartbreaking moment however is when Simba gets to Mufasas lifeless body and starts tugging at his fur only to start crying and cuddling up against the corpse of his dead father.Disney""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" (1996)Lots and lots of dark moments here From a deformed boy being locked up in a cathedral to being ridiculed in public to the way gypsies are portrayed in the film ""The Hunchback"" is one of Disneys darker offerings. And Frollos thoughts about Esmeralda evoke Catholic guilt and he decides he would rather burn down Paris than let anyone else have her.Disney""Hercules"" (1997)Filled with ancient monsters and the God of the Underworld ""Hercules"" is another dark movie as the female lead Meg literally sells her soul to Hades and spends the rest of her life hating the concept of love. Disney""Finding Nemo"" (2003)Yes ""Finding Nemo"" is on the list. At the start of the movie an entire clown fish population is devoured by a vicious barracuda. During Marlins quest to find his son Nemo (after he goes missing during a school day) he encounters dangerous-looking sea creatures and swims through shipwrecks and minefields.
