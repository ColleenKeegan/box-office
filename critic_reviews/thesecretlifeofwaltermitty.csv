"" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION The Secret Life of Walter Mitty(2013; PG)In theaters Tuesday 24 December 2013Genre Adventure Comedy DramaDirector Ben StillerCast Ben Stiller Kristen Wiig Adam Scott New Richard Roeper reviews weekdays at 500 PM ET only on REELZCHANNEL (13) Post a Comment  Alexsaid on Wednesday January 07 2015 10530 PMThis is a very well-analyzed review and although I do agree with much of what you say I couldnt help but feel that this movie will be cherished for years to come. It is nowhere near perfect; some of the CGI day-dream sequences are slightly over-the-top but they create somewhat of a striking juxtaposition between Mittys real-world adventures and his Dream World. I feel that to fully invest in Walters journey one needs to sympathize with the circumstances that leads to his journey of self-discovery. His life doesnt start off as a bad one but as an unremarkable one; and I feel this is the every man that many can relate to. mariesaid on Friday December 12 2014 10118 PMThink again Mr. Roeper This movie is beautiful and inspiring. Tomsaid on Wednesday December 03 2014 121216 AMEver since I heard that Ben Stiller who I loved in Zoolander Mystery Men as the Tom Cruise wannabee and many other films was directing an adaptation of one of my all-time favorite short stories ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" I wanted to see it. And when I saw that our local library had finally acquired a copy I rented it out. What I got was to a larger degree than Tropic Thunders unbelievably ridiculous Oscar-win climax an utterly unbelievable immensely uneven and ultimately cliched and boring self-homage by Stiller with much love to Stiller. The story starts out innocently enough in a contemporary setting but as the daydream fantasies are replaced by real life adventures each more unbelievable and ultimately ridiculous than the next coupled with a twist and climax that I saw coming a mile away my patience and ability to suspend disbelief got worn thinner and thinner. In the end the deep message to get out and experience life gets lost in a sea of platitudes and overblown epic imagery. The best thing about the movie are the visuals and its sad to think of what could have been achieved if Stiller had chosen to stay closer to Thurbers tack dreaming big but staying small. I would have much rather had a life of Pi twist where it all turns out to be the product of Mittys fertile imagination than the belief defying adventures that Mitty experiences. I mean seriously how many of us are employed by a massive multinational newspaper or have money to climb the Himalayas? Some of us cant even afford a gym membership. Stillers Mitty is about as much the James Thurber story as Frozen is Hans Christian Andersens The Snow Queen. Loosely based barely covers it. The nagging wife of many years has been replaced by the nagging boss/hatchetman who bears no love for Mitty (which the wife in the original story does have despite all her nagging) and indeed he seems to be a conflation of Mittys wife and the valet who smoothly parks Mittys car when Mittys distractions make him park badly. Mittys daydreaming episodes which leave him spaced out are all too quickly replaced by real world episodes that both outweigh and are of greater importance and require far more suspension of disbelief than anything he fantasizes about. Since its Christmas I would like to contrast Stillers Mitty with a true Christmas classic ""Its a Wonderful Life"". Set in a tiny snowbound town not unlike the tiny snowbound tow that features in the original short story George Bailey is a man who has to give up his dreams just like Mitty had. He runs his fathers old Building and Loan business fairly and humanely never fleecing his clients and allowing them to begin life with a bit of money in the bank and in their own home. When WW2 happens he never becomes a big hero unlike his brother. In the end his goodness and kindness toward others is his salvation. This is what I was hoping for - a smaller film where the magic of adventure only came through day dreaming. It would have been possible to stay true to the original narrative and yet have the most futuristic and modern visuals without needing to scale the Himalayas. Leslyesaid on Thursday November 13 2014 100751 PMAbsolutely loved this movie Just watched it a second time on HBO and enjoyed it just as much. Chris said on Wednesday May 21 2014 100743 AMI absolutely loved this movie So funny and uplifting. Truly heartwarming. Brian said on Friday May 16 2014 105445 PMI liked the movie a lot. Tylersaid on Saturday April 19 2014 20320 AMI find your review of this movie to be a bit odd. Its almost like you dont like Ben Stiller and read into it too much. I dont think he was referring to himself with the Indiana Jones comment but more to how the character has changed. Yes the story doesnt make much sense with digital media but that seems like a tiny thing to over look for the great story of Walter Mitty. Mario Jimenezsaid on Wednesday April 09 2014 52626 AMRR... you need not be so critical and hard on your -self- expectations and those of your peers when you give review(s). Honestly... To this day Ive yet to see the movie. The preview played during the holiday season. When I saw the preview I researched it.... A remake for todays audience ok. I read most comments by people that have seen this movie and have posted their take on it their delectable witticism. Im about to purchase this movie. Thank you Ben. Francois Dorquesaid on Thursday January 23 2014 100739 PMI liked the part where he eats the foot long hot dog and says ""it was nothing"". What a guy Hanna D.said on Tuesday January 07 2014 32746 PMI actually found this film quite good - except for the fact that the volcano-eruption caused immense problems in real life and wasnt treated with the necessary seriousness. But Ben Stiller was great to watch. Actually so were all the other actors. Good that Adam Scott gets to shine more Greetings from Central Europe Comments 1 - 10 of 13 1 2 | Next 3   Page 1 of 2 POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty reviewed Ben Stillers 2013 movie adaptation of the James Thurber short story fails to find its own sense of fun. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Searches for--And Never Quite Finds--Its Own Sense of Fun The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Searches for--And Never Quite Finds--Its Own Sense of Fun Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 31 2013 714 PM The Secret Life of Walter Mitty A movie searches for its own sense of fun. By Dana Stevens Ben Stiller directs and stars in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Photo courtesy Wilson Webb/Twentieth Century Fox I commend Ben Stiller for trying something in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty--an adaptation of the 1939 James Thurber story written by Steve Conrad and directed by and starring Stiller as the daydreaming office worker of the title--that few American comic directors would attempt. He chooses to frame Thurbers story not as a raucous action comedy (or like the 1947 adaptation starring Danny Kaye as a lighthearted romantic musical) but as a mournful possibly mystical voyage of self-discovery--put it this way there is a literal trip up a Himalayan mountain in search of a wise man--without giving up hope of making the audience laugh. Neither the spiritual insights nor the jokes always hit the mark and sometimes one cancels out the other giving the film a curiously neutral blank quality. But Stillers attempt to braid together introspection and humor kept me engaged and curious even when I wasnt quite sure what he was setting out to do. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. This Walter Mitty feels like a creation thats taken too long to fight its way out of its creators brain (and indeed Stiller and others have been trying with quixotic dedication to get the film made for almost two decades). Maybe this long incubation period accounts for the movies strange out-of-time quality Though its apparently set in the present day the film chronicles the folding of Life magazine as a print publication an event that happened more than a decade ago. Stillers Walter is a Life photo archivist--or in his dull description of his own job a ""negative assets manager""--whos anxious about being downsized as the magazine moves to an all-online format. His new boss the callow Ted Hendricks (an officious and luxuriantly bearded Adam Scott) is scarcely able to fake caring as he announces the impending firings to the magazines staff. Walters own job seems safe--hes been at the company 16 years after all--until he misplaces a negative from the legendary photographer Sean OConnell (Sean Penn) that was intended for Lifes final cover. With his boss breathing down his neck for the photo Walter resolves to track down the elusive OConnell whos so old-school he communicates with the magazine by telegram. In his quest for the grizzled photog Walter will travel to Greenland Iceland and finally Afghanistan. His real-life escapades (which include fighting off a shark fleeing an erupting volcano and taking a helicopter ride with a dead-drunk pilot) are frequently augmented by elaborate fantasy sequences in which Walter briefly becomes a champion of the oppressed an invincible action hero or a smoldering Latin lover. Advertisement As Cheryl Melhoff the Life co-worker on whom Walter harbors an entirely secret crush (and who helps him in his search for the mysterious missing negative) Kristen Wiig gives an understated but appealing performance that suits the movies muted mood. But in too many scenes--especially those involving Walters private revelations over the course of his various road trips--muted slides into muffled. As actors directing themselves will tend to do Stiller leaves the camera on his reflective face for long periods as he ponders for example getting on that copter with the drunk pilot (a choice that the movie frames somewhat oddly as an act of spiritual courage) or skateboarding at top speed down a deserted Icelandic highway. We pick up from contextual cues (and from the staggeringly gorgeous landscapes that surround him) that these must be the moments in which Walter is learning to truly experience life--something that despite his long employment at a magazine by that name he clearly knows next to nothing about. But the characters spiritual trajectory remains vague maybe because Walter himself is something of a nullity a conceit more than a character. When he finally meets up with the gnomic OConnell for some mountaintop philosophizing theres not really a sense that Walter well-traveled as he may now be is bringing any hard-won wisdom to the table--its just Sean Penn doing a lot of Pennsplaining. Top Comment Every time I see a trailer for this movie I think how much more appealing it would be if it starred Steve Carell.   More... -Laura M. Kiernan Join In Despite its occasional forays into an almost New Age spirituality (and at least three too many travel montages scored to soaring indie rock) theres a gentleness to The Secret Life of Walter Mitty that I appreciated. You see it in the scenes between Stillers character and his mother played by Shirley MacLaine with a sensitivity that points up the burlesquey broadness with which mothers are usually depicted in the bro-dude-grows-up school of film comedy. Walter Mitty is about a not-so-bro-dude who needs to grow down a long-constricted adult trying to rediscover some of his lost childhood passions (for skateboarding for travel for imagining himself as a part of a bigger life). But the note of sentimental uplift the film ends on doesnt feel entirely earned maybe because the pensive diffident Secret of Walter Mitty never quite gives the audience the gifts it eventually bestows on its hero--a renewed sense of playfulness possibility and fun.

"Review Ben Stiller gives Walter Mitty a smart antic touch - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Ben Stiller gives Walter Mitty a smart antic touch In this time when news is disseminated ever more quickly we asked our critics to list the best of entertainment and culture in 2013 in tweet form. Explore Turans list here and click through for his tweets as well as more in-depth essays. More from Turan Complete list | Analysis Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic As a director and star trying to extend into new territory Ben Stiller is his own best friend. With wild and crazy films like ""Zoolander"" and ""Tropic Thunder"" in his past Stillers taken a different turn in ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" but fortunately for all concerned the Old Ben has decided to come along for the ride.As a result ""Walter Mitty"" inspired by the brief 1939 James Thurber short story about a man who lapses into heroic daydreams at the slightest provocation has a pleasant curiously off-center quality that reflects the blending of these two sensibilities. On the one hand as written by Steven Conrad ""Secret Life"" is animated by the traditional idea that in Stillers own words ""we all have something inside us waiting to get out and all it takes is the courage to stop dreaming and start living.""PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TV But whenever things threaten to get too earnest (which they do) the directors alter ego as one of the sharpest comedy minds in the business kicks in. Those instincts for the absurd bring on moments of amusing fantasy that hearken as far back as TVs too smart for the room ""The Ben Stiller Show"" of the early 1990s.Because that Thurber story is so slight turning it into a feature leaves considerable latitude to create back story Danny Kaye for instance was a proofreader with an overbearing mother in the 1947 version and Stiller and company do their own inventing as well.A clue to the playfulness to follow as well as an indication of Stillers celebrated attention to detail are found in the Kyle Cooper/Prologue Films opening credits which artfully place bold-face names on the sides of buildings and other urban sites.PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Kenneth Turan The city in question is New York where Walter Mitty is introduced as an especially timid soul hesitating about whether to send an eHarmony wink to his comely coworker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig.) Later when Todd Maher (Patton Oswalt) his eHarmony consultant asks why hes left the ""been there done that"" section of his questionnaire blank Walter admits its because he hasnt been anywhere or done anything.Though Walter has confidence issues ""Secret Life"" takes pains not to paint him as a complete wimp. For one thing he has a healthy relationship with his mother (Shirley MacLaine) always a positive sign and its revealed later that as a younger man Walter was quite the skateboarder.That kind of physical exertion however seems well behind him in the job hes held for 16 years as the ""negative assets manager"" in the photo department of a fictionalized version of Life magazine. Few actors can manage looking as super-serious as Stiller and his performance is complete down to the pens in his shirt pocket and the precise tie tack he wears.PHOTOS Best films of 2013 | Betsy SharkeyBefore Walter can even get to work we see deft examples of the heroic daydreams/fantasies he is prone to brief but funny situations where or so his alter ego claims he lives by the ABCs -- ""audacious brave creative.""Once Walter arrives at the magazines office events combine to change everything. First he learns that Life has been sold to a dot.com entity and that the next issue will be its last in print. Staff will be cut and Ted Hendricks (a wacky Adam Scott) the zealous obnoxious managing director of transition given to saying things like ""Ive got a magazine to execute"" considers Walter to be especially superfluous.Also on this day of days Walter gets a roll of film -- yes film -- from old school Sean OConnell (Sean Penn) the last of Lifes great photographers. Walter has always looked after Seans negatives so hes especially disturbed to find that one shot on the roll negative 25 to be precise is missing in action.PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013Making matters worse Ted hears about negative 25 and decides to make it Lifes final cover sight unseen. Finding Sean and that missing frame becomes Walters top priority and that quest has an unexpected benefit It enables him to collaborate closely with girl of his dreams Cheryl.Wiig best known for her lengthy ""Saturday Night Live"" stint and her starring role in ""Bridesmaids"" is quietly effective as the low-key Cheryl who gradually warms to Walter and encourages him to throw caution to the wind and search the world for Sean OConnell.That extended expedition takes up the biggest chunk of ""Secret Life"" and features some fine comic moments starting with Walters eccentric adventures in Iceland (Olafur Darri Olafsson is especially funny as an inebriated pilot) and moving on to even more extreme situations.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TV With Walters real adventures paralleling his fantasies opportunities for personal growth abound and even though this inevitably leads to periodic marking of time Stillers sensibility creates a movie thats smarter than you think it will be.

(Photo/Video Paramount Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated Dec. 24 2013 142 p.m. ET More Markets How Investigators Untangled the Wolf Scandal In ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort the celebrated crook of the 1990s who prided himself on his ability to sell anything and did in fact swindle investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars. Martin Scorseses epic-scale comedy of criminality adapted by Terence Winter from Mr. Belforts book of the same name is selling three hours of incessant shouting and sensationally bad behavior--mud wrestling without the mud that includes drugs booze debauchery degeneracy and dwarf-throwing. Its meant to be an entertaining even meaningful representation of the penny-stock maestros life and times. But I couldnt buy it and couldnt wait for the hollow spectacle to end. Thats no knock on Mr. DiCaprio who throws himself heart and soul into a character with deep deficits in both departments. Lets stipulate that his extravagant embodiment of excess is extremely skillful and very funny and put other stipulations on record as well. Jonah Hill equipped with phosphorescent teeth and a manic affect is often hilarious as Jordans partner in the sleazy firm of Stratton Oakmont. So is Matthew McConaughey in a madcap soliloquy on masturbation and the need to stay relaxed. The film does full justice to its denizens devotion to cocaine Quaaludes and heroin and to morphine which Jordan takes ""because its awesome."" The Scorsese touch is everywhere in evidence swirling set pieces (Stratton Oakmonts boiler room full of rabid brokers as a Roman bacchanal) spectacular camera moves (Rodrigo Prieto was the cinematographer) and all of it heightened and sharpened by Thelma Schoonmakers editing. Some of the settings are enjoyable up to a point for their tacky sumptuousness I liked the trashing of a Lamborghini Countach. And sharp-witted scenes do play out from time to time on a human scale. In one of them a couple of FBI agents engage the wily Jordan in a game of cat-and-rat. ENLARGE Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort. Paramount Pictures Eventually though the pandemonium wears you down; in my case eventually meant the end of the first hour with two more hours to go. ""Stratton Oakmont is America"" insists Jordan ever the overreacher in the course of his self-serving valedictory. Maybe so but any meaningful perspective on the greedfest of the period is obscured by the gleefulness of the depiction. The film may well prove profitable Lurid outlaws are always appealing and theres pleasure to be had in the downfall of slimeballs. But ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" demands a huge investment of time for a paltry return. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Sometimes you see failed films and think well they tried for this or that but couldnt pull it off. After seeing Ben Stillers version of the venerable James Thurber story I dont know what the film was trying for. Its a cipher in every realm but the visual. (Stuart Dryburgh did the stylish cinematography.) ENLARGE Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) imagines himself as a fearless mountain climber who captures the attention of his co-worker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig). 20th Century Fox Mr. Stiller isnt the first one of course to play Walter Mitty on screen. In 1947 eight years after the Thurber story appeared in The New Yorker magazine an elaborate MGM production starred Danny Kaye as the wistful daydreamer who imagines himself in heroic situations. The movie was overblown with a succession of preposterous adventures that grew tedious; its durable reputation is due to its star a great comic actor who did memorably well with Walters mood swings between mousy and manic. Mr. Stillers version written by Steve Conrad wisely moderates the derring-do but unwisely sends its hero on a quest that swings tentatively between the spiritual and the absurd. Even the starting point feels tentative. The time is the present but Walter works in the photo department of Life magazine which closed down as a standalone publication more than a decade ago. (He goes forth in search of a missing negative shot by a legendary photographer.) Walter does have outlandish adventures in the Himalayas Greenland and Iceland but the lines between his fantasies and reality keep getting blurred. You dont know for instance if hes imagining himself jumping from a chopper into arctic waters or really making the jump. Whether the blurring is intentional or accidental it vitiates a film that already feels dissociated as if the basic narrative structure hadnt been thought through. Impressive landscapes plus Kristen Wiigs appealing Cheryl the fellow worker who inflames Walters passion make the movie enjoyable enough. Yet its style is a constant bafflement and nowhere more so than in a key scene on a Himalayan mountaintop--an encounter between Walter and a character played by Sean Penn. One could imagine the scene being played relatively straight as a moment of fleeting profundity in a comedy or as the culmination of a shaggy-dog story. Whats so baffling is the way it has been played--drained of energy tone or discernible attitude. Like so much of this journey by a shy guy from Life magazine Walters peak experience is weirdly lifeless. August Osage County Family dysfunction has seldom been as flamboyant--or notable for its performances and flow of language--as it is in this screen version of the Tracy Letts play directed by John Wells from a screenplay by the playwright. The cast alone is worth the price of admission Meryl Streep as the cancer-riddled drug-addled matriarch Violet Weston; Sam Shepard as her alcoholic husband; Julia Roberts Julianne Nicholson and Juliette Lewis as the couples daughters; and Chris Cooper Ewan McGregor Margo Martindale Benedict Cumberbatch and Abigail Breslin as members of their extended family. The language rich in invective flows from kindred spirits who are rich in aggressiveness both the active and passive flavors. By comparison to this familial Grand Guignol ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" is a crash course in decorousness. Watch the trailer for ""August Osage County"" a new film based on the Pulitzer Prize winning play by Tracy Letts. Starring Meryl Streep Julia Roberts Ewan McGregor and more. When I saw the play on Broadway some years ago I had a good seat down front on the left yet awkward staging prevented me from seeing Violet at the family table at the peak of her rage. Estelle Parsons was formidable in the role but one of Vis daughters had plunked herself down between her mother and me. The movie provides perfect sight lines meaning a chance to see Ms. Streep do all of her stuff at every moment and she is marvelous. (So what else is new about her work?) In addition to raging Vi wheedles needles seduces and charms and her mental fogs disperse miraculously whenever she finds a chance to lacerate one of her loved ones with something mean. ENLARGE Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. Weinstein Co. The movie also gives us a chance to see Ms. Roberts in action and shes marvelous too in an austere style that perfectly complements Ms. Streeps volcanism. Her Barbara has the dubious gifts of clarity and self-irony. She sees her mother and her family for the tortured people they are but shes still her mothers daughter. In a dark determinist comedy about the transmission of rage from one generation to the next this seemingly vital woman is incurably infected. The Invisible Woman Ralph Fienness elegantly crafted agreeably leisurely period drama does a public service by making the woman of the title visible. Born Ellen Ternan into a family of actors she was often called Nelly and as an 18-year-old became the very young and secret lover of Charles Dickens who was more than twice her age. The service lies partly in bringing Nelly out of obscurity--her story is one of a steep price paid for the passionate attention of a literary giant who may have had no love to give anyone but the characters in his books. It also lies in casting Felicity Jones who is as eloquent and beautifully modulated in the role as she is physically beautiful. Still Dickens dominates the story; hes a fiery presence as played by Mr. Fiennes who directed from Abi Morgans adaptation of a book by Claire Tomalin. ENLARGE Ralph Fiennes as Charles Dickens and Felicity Jones as Nelly Ternan Sony Pictures Classics This immeasurably famous writer and amateur actor doesnt mean to enslave Nelly to him. Still hes at the height of his career and engulfed by writing amateur acting and a gift for giving spellbinding readings. Its tempting to call him a 19th-century London version of a rock star but Dickens was far more accessible than that Londoners knew him flocked to him and drew pleasure from his proximity. Nelly draws pleasure too. Shes inexorably attracted to him even after she comes to understand that their relationship will remain secret. The film overemphasizes Dickenss emotional repression; in fact he was devastated by a terrible accident that in the film leaves him relatively cold and mainly concerned about preserving the secrecy of Nellys status. But ""The Invisible Woman"" gives us a plausible image of the great man in the fullness of his celebrity and an affecting portrait of the woman who lived much of her life in his shadow. Lone Survivor Peter Bergs screen version of Marcus Luttrells book is remarkably good at dramatizing the notorious 2005 Navy SEAL operation that went horrifically bad. The power of this production isnt evident in the preface a standard-brand account of the rigors of SEAL training. And familiar themes of combat movies make up most of the operations initial phase--cocky banter macho preening talk of wives and girlfriends back home. The first hint of whats to come is someones casually ominous observation about the complexity of the joint military planning ""A lot of moving parts."" ENLARGE ""Lone Survivor"" the story of four Navy SEALs on a covert mission to neutralize a high-level Taliban operative. Universal Pictures The parts were set in motion for Operation Red Wings a covert mission intended to kill or capture a Taliban commander in northern Afghanistan. A four-man team of SEALs was ambushed by Taliban fighters and the books author then the team medic was the lone survivor of a debacle that also took the lives of 16 men aboard a rescue helicopter shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade. Mr. Luttrell now retired is played by Mark Wahlberg; the other team members are played by Taylor Kitsch Emile Hirsch and Ben Foster. All four performances are first-rate and the action is staged with shattering intensity. Literally and graphically shattering. The film is a celebration of courage and the brotherhood of warriors facing unfathomable danger in the service of their country. These too are familiar themes but they take on new meaning in ""Lone Survivor."" The SEALs arent just shot at in a merciless firefight. They are shot time and again. They are almost aerated by Taliban bullets and they fight on. Their training has turned them into fighting machines and their equipment employs technologies undreamed of in earlier wars. Yet their high-tech edge is blunted by faulty communications their support is compromised by limited resources--the film doesnt try to score political points on this score but questions are implicit in the narrative--and their flesh and blood are anguishingly vulnerable when all the planning comes unraveled. A lot of moving parts in a moving film. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Mean Streets (1973) This is the wellspring of Martin Scorseses career. Every potent element of his art flowed from it the violence the sense of evil the tribal warfare the fascination with criminality and the explosive style. Its a small-scale film with enormous impact even now four decades after it hit the screen. The setting is Little Italy where Mr. Scorsese grew up and the cast includes the stunningly young Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel. The script was written by Mardik Martin and the director who also played a gunman in a car. Greenberg (2010) ENLARGE Ben Stiller was uncompromisingly brilliant though widely unpopular in Noah Baumbachs comedy which scintillates with intelligence razors-edge humor and austere empathy for its struggling lovers. Mr. Stiller is Roger Greenberg a middle-aging misanthrope whose anger is matched only by his narcissism. Greta Gerwig gives a performance of heartbreaking delicacy as Florence Marr a wistful young woman falling into a love affair with him. ""Ive gotta stop doing things just because they feel good"" Florence says but theres no evidence she feels truly good about anything. Coriolanus (2011) ENLARGE In choosing one of Shakespeares more opaque plays for his directorial debut Ralph Fiennes emulated the character he portrays a refractory Roman general Caius Martius Coriolanus for whom compromise equals surrender. But the general comes to a bad end while Mr. Fiennes achieved a great beginning as a director and his performance stands as a chilling exemplar of psychomartial ferocity. The cast includes Jessica Chastain as the heros ardent wife Virgilia; Gerard Butler as Tullus Aufidius his mortal enemy; and Vanessa Redgrave as his mother Volumnia alongside whom todays tiger moms seem toothless.

Ben Stiller stars as a daydreamer who imagines himself as a fearless mountain climber who captures the attention of his co-worker played by Kristen Wiig. Photo Wilson Webb Twentieth Century Fox Secret Life of Walter Mitty review Logic lost in a dream 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Comedy-Drama. Starring Ben Stiller and Kristen Wiig. Directed by Ben Stiller. (PG. 114 minutes.) If while watching ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" you start wondering why Ben Stiller is acting strange the answer comes during the closing credits ""Directed by Ben Stiller."" There is something within people that tempts us to film ourselves in moments of wistful contemplation. I say ""people"" and not just ""filmmakers"" because I suspect that if you gave most people a camera and a budget they would do the same. We spend much of our lives inside our own heads. Why shouldnt we grasp the chance to show just how beautiful and sensitive we truly are? Alas the harsh answer to that question is that nobody wants to see it. Or rather that no one wants to see that as the main course as a movies reason for being. In the case of Stiller its one thing to direct oneself in a comedy such as ""Zoolander"" and ""Tropic Thunder"" but drama is difficult because instead of being the butt of the joke youre the locus of sensitivity and meaning. It only compounds the difficulty when youre playing someone who is meek fearful and lost in a dream. ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is based on the much-loved 1939 short story by James Thurber about a mild nondescript fellow who keeps lapsing into grandiose fantasies. In Steve Conrads screenplay the setting is updated to modern-day New York where Walter (Stiller) works at Life magazine curating the negatives while pining for one of his co-workers played by Kristen Wiig. She is so nice in the film that she actually seems to develop an attraction for Walter even though he all but contracts narcolepsy in her presence - and thats only when hes not stammering and looking at her with hangdog helpless longing. What a catch. As if Stiller werent taking on enough in directing himself ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" has a tricky screenplay. It has little narrative interest and requires that the director latch onto a very specific airy tone of whimsy lest the whole souffle collapse. Its just a wisp of a story A negative has gone missing and so Walter travels the earth in search of the photographer who took it. The locations are in themselves worthy. If youve ever flown to England and wondered about Iceland and Greenland as you passed by heres your chance to find out what theyre doing down there. Sean Penn plays the photographer and his one scene is the best in the movie. Stiller is in love with the lines of Penns face as well he should be. But Stiller never quite finds the right zone between reality and fantasy so as to make sense of the action. For example Walter throws away a wallet for no reason. Later he finds out there was something important in the wallet but he doesnt make a phone call that might retrieve it. Later he comes into possession of the precious negative but he never looks at it etc. In a dreamy construct such behavior could have its own logic but not in what is essentially a straight drama (with some laughs thrown in). In a straight setup the characters just seem like theyre getting pushed around and shoehorned to fit into some preconceived ending. Because they are.

Painstakingly stylish this is Stillers most ambitious directorial work to date but also his most cloying a Hallmark card piously urging viewers to ""embrace the unknown"" among other platitudes. Some scenes are sharpened by his quirky sense of humor (a bizarre riff on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button recaptures the cheekiness of his MTV sketch show) but this lacks the satire of Tropic Thunder or the dark comedy of The Cable Guy still his best movies.

(Wilson Webb) B- The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013) Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Kristen Wiig Sean Penn Adam Scott Ben Stiller; Director Ben Stiller; Release Date Wide 12/25/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 125; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted January 7 2014 -- 1200 AM EST Its easy to understand why comedians like Jim Carrey Mike Myers and Sacha Baron Cohen have flirted with adapting James Thurbers 1939 New Yorker story about a timid man with a vibrant fantasy life. Not only has CGI made it relatively simple to turn Walter Mittys daydreams into Technicolor tapestries of digital eye candy its also the kind of emotionally textured role that can be a springboard out of the banana-peel slapstick ghetto. Ben Stillers no stranger to such clown-crying-on-the-inside gambits (see Permanent Midnight and Greenberg). But his new film The Secret Life of Walter Mitty despite all of its visual razzle-dazzle never locates the beating heart of its hero. Stiller who also directed plays Mitty as an absentminded socially awkward nebbish who works in the photo department at LIFE magazine. The irony of course is that even though he works at a place called LIFE he hasnt lived. Instead he retreats into his head and imagines himself a dashing mountain climber or a hot-blooded Casanova. Stiller and screenwriter Steven Conrad have given Thurbers story a 21st-century twist by setting the film in our era of corporate downsizing. LIFE is about to cease publishing and for its final cover the editors have chosen a shot from their globe-trotting photojournalist star Sean OConnell (Sean Penn). Then Mitty misplaces the negative. And with the encouragement of a co-worker hes sweet on (Kristen Wiig) he embarks on a quest to find OConnell leading him to Greenland and the Himalayas. As Stillers Mitty crisscrosses the planet he slowly transforms into the action hero hes always been in his fantasies. While stunning sequences show him skateboarding away from an erupting volcano and fighting off a great white shark the character never becomes more than a fuzzy conceit. At the risk of psychoanalyzing a film thats already too deep inside its own head Stiller seems to lack the confidence as a dramatic actor to fully commit to the emotional potential of his story. Too often he aims at our funny bones when he should be targeting our heartstrings. In the end Walter Mitty is a film about acting out our dreams. But Stiller never quite shows us the soul of his dreamer.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; secret-life-of-walter-mitty-the ) Secret Life of Walter Mitty The (United States 2013) December 24 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli One could make a compelling argument that The Secret Life of Walter Mitty does what a good remake should do it takes the essential premise of the original and while retaining some of the names and touchstones of its predecessor moves in a new direction. Viewed from that standpoint Ben Stillers The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is both familiar and fresh. Fans of the 1947 classic wont feel marooned by a filmmaker with no affection for the original nor will they believe theyre watching an inferior carbon copy. Unfortunately where The Secret Life of Walter Mitty lets down its audience is with a flaccid narrative. Its hard to pinpoint the cause of the problem but Walters story never engages. His adventures seem perfunctory. The movie comes to life when stars Ben Stiller (who plays Walter) and Kristin Wiig (who plays his love interest Cheryl) share the screen but its less engrossing during the long globetrotting sequences that have Walter on the trail of hotshot photographer Sean OConnell (Sean Penn). Is the underlying premise of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty too ""innocent"" for a 2013 film? The story is about a meek office worker who lives vicariously through the photographic negatives he processes at Life magazine. When a prized photo - the one designated for the cover of the final print issue of the magazine - is missing Walter is forced to go on a real-life adventure to locate the photographer. Along the way he finds himself and gains a new appreciation of life. Films of this sort may have worked well in a ""simpler"" era but this one could have difficulty finding an audience in a time when a defining social characteristic is cynicism. The only cynics in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty are the bad guys like Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) the new boss who berates and belittles Walter before firing him. The most enjoyable parts of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty are his fantasies such as one in which he stands up to his boss in a way he never would in real life. The actual adventure arc which takes up more than half the movies running length and transports Walter to Greenland Iceland and Afghanistan is more like a travelogue with a couple of action/adventure set pieces. The scenery is beautiful but the story seems to be spinning its wheels. The objective is to get Walter to experience life before he catches up to Sean but there are a lot of sequences when the movie seems to be stalling for time. Ben Stiller who chaperoned this movie out of development hell and all the way to the big screen has the perfect ""everyman"" quality to play Walter. The only other big-name actor I could see in this role is Tom Hanks from about a decade ago. Kristen Wiig tones down some of her more annoying comedic mannerisms to present an attractive and appealing Cheryl. She and Stiller evidence perfect PG chemistry - sparks dont necessarily fly but one can imagine a great big heart with an arrow through it appearing the air above them. Theyre cute. There are a couple of high profile actors in small roles - Shirley MacLean as Walters mother and Sean Penn as the elusive photographer. Adam Scott is the stereotypical bottom line-oriented boss whose business-minded approach clashes with Walters whimsical one. If theres one thing missing from The Secret Life of Walter Mitty its that Hendricks never gets a comeuppance. In fact as the film moves toward its climax he vanishes from the story. Its an odd choice and Im not sure it works. The word ""old fashioned"" can be used to describe The Secret Life of Walter Mitty; unfortunately thats not necessarily the kind of description that will translate into box office success. This is a moderately enjoyable but largely forgettable confection. Its being marketed as a family film but young children with short attention spans will probably be bored. Stiller deserves credit for remaining true to the spirit of the original; unfortunately he fails to recapture the magic and that makes the 2013 iteration of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty only fitfully satisfying.

In the studio era movies were often based on short stories. Classic case in point ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" a whimsical story that James Thurber published in the New Yorker in 1939. It was expanded into a feature-length comedy starring Danny Kaye in 1947. But even in his wildest imaginings Mitty could not have foreseen the spectacular version starring Ben Stiller. We mean ""spectacular"" in the literal sense -- this is a big-budget special-effects movie set in the present day. But its also a PG-rated production that is essentially true to the humane spirit of the original.Walter (director Ben Stiller) is a meek file clerk in the photography department of Life magazine in New York. As Walter is working up the nerve to talk to co-worker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) corporate cannibals led by Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) start carving up the company and Walters head is on the chopping block. He wont survive the transition to a digital-only operation if he cant find a particular photo for the final print edition a mysterious image from globe-trotting journalist Sean OConnell (Sean Penn). Walter who has never misplaced a photo negative in his years of loyal service embarks on a worldwide quest to find the image save his job and impress Cheryl. Trouble is hes a daydreamer. Most of his heroic adventures take place in his own head. Stillers shrewd choice is to integrate the fantasy sequences without some kind of transitional effect a la ""Waynes World."" Thus its a bracing shock when he races into a burning building to save Cheryls three-legged dog but then were skeptical when this mousey man scurries to Greenland to sniff out a clue and Stiller has to assure that this atypical behavior is not a dream. The last half of the film gets rather ridiculous as wide-awake Walter travels from Greenland to Iceland to Afghanistan to find the photo (and still has enough cellphone reception to confer with counselor Patton Oswalt from an online dating site). Yet despite the lapses in logic the story hooks us because Stiller is such a human hero. And theres an emotional payoff involving Shirley MacLaine a skateboard and some cake that is worth waiting for.In our daydreams an ambitious world-embracing movie such as ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" deserves to be a bigger hit than yet another ""Night at the Museum"" or ""Madagascar"" sequel.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint What a curious product this is. ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is star/director Ben Stillers big swing for the fences his bid to deliver a whopper that defines him as a filmmaker of the first rank. Its a swing and a miss. The title character is very small a milquetoast photo librarian for Life magazine. The movie like Walters daydreams is very big. Its clearly angling for best picture production design cinematography and visual effects Oscars. There are action sequences that would fit comfortably into a Marvel superhero movie and magnificent nature panoramas worthy of a Patagonia catalog. Every shot strains to be the most the biggest the ultimate. The problem is giving a comedy a blockbuster scale does not make it exponentially funnier. Stillers ""Mitty"" ever-so-loosely based on James Thurbers subversive short story is a strenuous exercise in crowd-pleasing with the emotional heft of a ""Hang in there"" kitten poster. Colorless Walter spends his days cataloging images from adventurous photographers. Hes too introverted to approach his office crush (Kristen Wiig all sweet easygoing charm). Hes too timid to confront the condescending new boss (droll nasty Adam Scott) who is overseeing the magazines final print edition. He doesnt even have the Dilbert-like gumption to fume resentfully. Walter is a nonentity to everyone but a legendary photojournalist (Sean Penn) who entrusts the humble clerk with the best picture of his career the haunting image he declares will make the perfect farewell cover. The image that Walter for the life of him cannot find. You will not be shocked to learn that chasing down the globe-hopping devil-may-care cameraman to locate the lost photo transforms Walter. On intercontinental adventures that find him outrunning volcanic explosions in Iceland wrestling sharks in the freezing North Atlantic and trekking the Himalayas Walter evolves from a creature of fey pathos into a self-reliant mensch. So far so formula. The real surprise is that Stiller who directed the sharp comedies ""The Cable Guy"" ""Zoolander"" and ""Tropic Thunder"" would release a movie this cloying and tonally wobbly. Walters daydreams have him leaping into exploding apartment buildings and battling his abusive boss on New York City streets like Spider-Man vs. the Green Goblin. Then the film downshifts to low-key domestic comedy with Kathryn Hahn and Shirley MacLaine as Walters ditsy sister and doting mom. Theres an odd throwaway sequence with Stiller and Wiig lampooning ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" then a musical interlude with Wiig serenading Stiller on guitar (a passage that at least advances the plot). Hope springs when Patton Oswalt makes an 11th-hour appearance then dies as his character is denied even a dollop of wit. THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY  out of 4 stars Rating PG for some crude comments language and action violence. The film never finds its footing and viewers will be forgiven for losing track of which moments are fact or fantasy. What they will surely not lose track of is the aggressive in-story promotion of a certain pizza chain online dating service nationwide bank pastry franchise and childs toy all forcefully inserted into the film regardless of context. It may be the films only memorable aspect. Mittys journeys to Timbuktu are altogether too cutesy-poo. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (PG-13) Ben Stiller stars in and directs this new adaptation of the James Thurber short story about a hopeless daydreamer. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/24/2013 Editor rating 3 The first time we meet Walter Mitty (Ben Stiller) hes sitting at his computer logged into the online matchmaking service eHarmony trying to build up the courage to send a ""wink"" (the equivalent of a Facebook poke) to Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) a co-worker at Life magazine. Walters finger hovers over his keyboard for what feels like an eternity -- Stiller who also directed the movie is operating on a much subtler comedic vibe here than he did in Tropic Thunder and Zoolander -- and when he finally takes a deep breath and clicks the send button he gets an error message. The wink did not go through. Please try again. On the outside Walter comes off as a hapless loner Hes so quiet and shy hes practically invisible. But on the inside -- specifically inside his imagination -- hes a fearless daredevil jumping off train platforms to rescue victims from a burning building fighting bullies in comic book-style battles that tear up city streets and telling smarmy people off with a ferocity that reduces them to tears. ""I live by my ABC Adventurous Brave and Creative"" Walter tells himself even though nothing he does displays any of those qualities. But theyre buried in there somewhere He just needs a little push to get them out. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty was adapted from James Thurbers short story by Steve Conrad (The Weather Man The Promotion The Pursuit of Happyness) who has a knack for leavening comedy with an undercurrent of lovely quiet sadness and who has great empathy for working-class people. The movie is set during a takeover of Life magazine Its new owners headed by a cretinous Adam Scott are preparing to put out the final print issue and need Walter to provide them with the negative the staffs star photographer Sean OConnell (Sean Penn) sent him. The only problem Walter has lost the negative and has no way of getting in contact with Sean who doesnt own a cell phone and is constantly traveling to remote places around the world. So Walter sets out to find him -- first stop Greenland --and soon hes actually living an adventure narrowly avoiding getting eaten by sharks rather than imagining one. The movies ending is never in question By the time he completes his quest Walter will have emerged from his shell and maybe even have worked up the courage to ask Cheryl out on a date. But how Walter gets there is unexpected. Far less of a nebbish than Thurbers character Stiller plays Mitty as a man who at one point in his life set aside his wild and reckless nature (as a teenager he was a mohawked skateboarder) and fell too deeply into his dull groove to climb out. But instead of throwing him into a series of Indiana Jones adventures The Secret Life of Walter Mitty takes a slower more contemplative route to its protagonists inner re-awakening. The fun flashy fantasy segues into a mellower sequence of encounters and events culminating with a climb to the upper Himalayas in Afghanistan in which Mitty doesnt discover himself He just remembers who he is. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is filled with small memorable moments that coalesce into a sweet if predictable parable about embracing life. Shirley MacLaine pops up as Walters ever-forgiving mother and Wigg kills in an elevating sequence in which she sings David Bowies Space Oddity at a karaoke bar. Penn only gets one scene but its a great one and it reminds you how funny he can be. Even the relationship between Walter and Cheryl telegraphed as it is becomes tender and involving. Here is the rare big Hollywood picture that starts out on a huge canvas and gradually shrinks in scope and size to focus on ordinary people. How often do you see that happen?

"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Arts amp; Entertainment Arts amp; Entertainment Review The Secret Life of Walter Mitty  Secret Life of Walter Mitty Wilson Webb/Twentieth Century Fox Ben Stiller stars in ""Secret Life of Walter Mitty."" Ben Stiller stars in ""Secret Life of Walter Mitty."" (Wilson Webb/Twentieth Century Fox) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Privacy Policy So. Turns out the only thing the prototypical American milquetoast Walter Mitty needed to get happy was a little stubble and a lavish travel budget.In director Ben Stillers earnest-but-screwy go at ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" Stiller himself takes the role of the daydreaming ""Yes dear"" fellow introduced in a wee-but-hardy 1939 James Thurber short story. Thurber sold it to The New Yorker and eventually his grey little man with prodigious dreams of heroism was given the Hollywood treatment in a post-war Danny Kaye vehicle. Stiller has no interest in delivering the comic mania of Kaye. Rather his Mitty is the center of an easygoing self-actualization travelogue in which the title character here conceived as a photo archivist for a dying Life magazine lurches from Greenland to Afghanistan searching for an elusive photojournalist played by Sean Penn. (For the record Life actually died several years ago.) In screenwriter Steven Conrads story a crucial missing image captured by the photographer but misplaced under Mittys usually eagle-eyed watch is desperately needed for Lifes final cover. Recovering it may be the key to Mitty hanging onto his old-school defiantly pre-digital job.The irony of a story hinging on a tiny scrap of film forced to compete with a sea of computer-generated imagery is pretty odd. The movie feels uncertain as to its own tones and intentions. Fantasy blowouts such as Stiller battling a slimy corporate takeover artist played by Adam Scott) offer a chuckle or two. Then were back to the other movie the one Stiller clearly had more interest in making. Mitty is in love with a co-worker played by Kristen Wiig. The scenes between Stiller and Wiig have real charm and Stillers enough of a director to know when to simply let a leisurely patch of dialogue unfold in a single shot (in this first-conversation case on a Manhattan sidewalk). Elsewhere though ""Walter Mitty"" operates on a scale that feels way way off. Once Mitty leaves the confines of his shrinking life and crosses time zones in pursuit of the photographer the seams of the picture threaten to split. Is a 21st century film about a Walter Mitty type really best served by gorgeous eye-popping location shooting on a near-100 million budget?Shirley MacLaine has a pleasant scene or two as Mittys mom; Patton Oswalt works shrewd wonders as the voice (and then the face) of an eHarmony dating representative trying to get Mitty to goose up his profile. The film has a persistent and careful sheen. It looks good. It is in fact preoccupied with looking good. If this sounds like faint praise Im afraid it is.""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" - 2 starsMPAA rating PG (for some crude comments language and action violence)Running time 205Opens Wednesday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Ben Stiller Reviews Kristen Wiig Art Arts and Culture Review Wolf of Wall Street  Review Mandela Long Walk to Freedom Latest movie reviews Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising77deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/chi-secret-life-walter-mitty-review-20131224,0,5175099.column",200,thesecretlifeofwaltermitty13,thesecretlifeofwaltermitty,chicagotribune

The main character played by Ben Stiller works in midtown Manhattans Time + Life Building my business home for 33 years. He is employed by a weekly Time Inc. news publication -- Life not TIME -- which is about to be taken over and downsized; Time Inc. is to be spun off from its parent corporation Time Warner some time next year. Mittys job now threatened is to manage and care for the photographs of that great old publication; Mary Corliss ran the Museum of Modern Art Film Stills Archive for 34 years and in 2002 she was abruptly let go and that invaluable archive shuttered after a four-and-a-half-month strike in which Mary played an important role. For my wife and me watching this movie was like sitting through our surprise dual biography so many of its images triggering memories of poignancy or pleasure. (READ Mary and the Case of the Missing Film Stills) Mitty directed by Stiller from Steve Conrads script still couldve stunk; and it has its occasional longueurs. But even people not named Corliss people not involved in the endangered crafts of print journalism and photo curating should be able to connect with the movies sweet and mournful tone. Anthony Lane reviewing the film in The New Yorker said it ""keeps glancing backward at the lost and the obsolete."" Exactly and in a good way Mitty pays tribute to people who cherish the past and in the face of extinction are devoted to preserving it. Beyond that Mitty is a lovely romantic comedy -- the portrait of a man nearly swallowed by the gulf between the world his lives in and the world he dreams of who manages to bridge the two and to find Ms. Right in the workplace he cherishes. The movie takes its title and little else from James Thurbers 2079-word story published in The New Yorker 75 years ago next March. Thurbers Mitty is a henpecked husband driving his wife to her weekly hair date in Waterbury Conn. As his wife or a garage mechanic berates him Mitty slips into five fantasy roles a Navy Captain a genius surgeon a master criminal a pilot on a suicide mission and finally a hero facing a firing squad. So meager and hopeless is Mittys life that his last daydream is of violent death. (READ James Thurbers story ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"") The 1947 movie musical starring Danny Kaye took a half-step toward the new film. Mitty works as an editor of pulp-fiction magazines whose lurid tales fuel his reveries; and a mysterious woman leads him into real-life exploits more extravagant than his wildest woolgatherings. Stillers Mitty also goes on adventures though of his own choosing to find the photograph that will be on the cover of Lifes final print edition. The expiring magazine is Walters secret Life. At the start though he is just a schlub with a furtive crush on his new Life colleague Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig). Logging on to eHarmony.com he cannot even ""wink"" at Cheryl; the technology defeats him. Waiting for the train to take him downtown to work Walter imagines a tenement building bursting into flames; like Superman he vaults from the platform into the building to save Cheryls three-legged dog -- and presents her with a furry prosthesis for the pets missing limb. At work he materializes as a Spanish stud in a snow storm wooing Cheryl with soothing words and a ""poetry falcon""; and he sees himself as Benjamin Button an infant with an old mans face cradled and nurtured by Cheryl. Unfortunately for Walter he also fantasizes talking sass to Ted (Adam Scott) the slimy bearded three-piece-suited dude whose job is to turn Life from a magazine to a digital domain in the speediest most contemptible way possible. Ted thinks Walter petrified in his dreams is an idiot who is withholding that last cover picture taken by revered photographer Sean OConnell (Sean Penn). In fact the negative is missing and locating it becomes Walters mission. He and the audience must follow three pictorial clues left by Sean; they lead Walter to Greenland Iceland the Himalayas and back home. (READ a review of the 1947 The Secret Life of Walter Mitty by subscribing to TIME) The Stiller and Kaye films twisted Thurbers thesis that modern man seeks freedom in dreams from nagging reality but can never escape. Serious fiction including serious humorous fiction paints the cage that imprisons humanity. Movies in the 1940s or today unlock the cell door; the screen is a wall showing the rich life that society may deny us. Stillers Mitty lives in that dream world. Early in the film Walter may have little hope; yet he and Cheryl are destined to come together if only because they have eyes of a magical blue -- movie-star eyes. And when he goes on his world tour this little man in a sedentary job turns out to be an expert bicyclist runner and skateboarder. The movie has a lot of Walter exercising. In development for nearly 20 years the Mitty project was at one time or another to have starred Jim Carrey Owen Wilson Mike Myers or Sacha Baron Cohen and to have been directed by Ron Howard Chuck Russell Steven Spielberg Gore Verbinski or Mark Waters. The final script by Conrad who had written The Weather Man for Verbinski became Stillers fifth feature film as director after Reality Bites The Cable Guy the great Zoolander and Tropic Thunder. (SEE Derek Zoolander on one of the Top 10 fake TIME magazine covers) An auteur with an acute visual touch Stiller fills the wide screen artfully and playfully. In one shot our attention is directed to Walter in the rear of the frame hes a blur even as his own undeveloped life is a picture that has not yet come into focus. The cue for Walters daydreams is often a subtle shift into a sharp old-fashioned Kodachrome color. Later on his intercontinental journey he sees a flock of birds that assemble Cheryls face in the sky. As he treks the Himalayas his words -- ""Now at 18000 feet my mind drifts like the snow"" -- are scrawled across the screen like an entry in an adventurers diary. Stiller also extracts appealing performances from the supporting cast Shirley MacLaine as Walters mother Patton Oswalt as his eHarmony contact Adrian Martinez as his dark-room assistant and especially Olafur Darri Olafsson as a drunken bear of a helicopter pilot. The most romantic notion held by this very dreamy film is the value of an important job done well. Roaming corridors filled with giant reproductions of old Life covers Walter is haunted by Henry Luces mission statement in the first issue of Life synopsized here as ""To see the world things dangerous to come to to see behind walls to draw closer to find each other and to feel. That is the purpose of Life."" And of Walters life whether he is jumping from a helicopter into a turbulent sea infested with sharks or sitting in his photo archive trying to make a phantom picture come into focus. (READ What would Henry Luce make of the digital age?) The Secret Life of Walter Mitty proclaims that the past is worth treasuring every bit as much as the fantasy future. Like Walter -- and two people named Corliss -- this touching movie elegy believes not just in the wonder of what might be but in the glory of what was.

Among the funny men -- most of whom have calcified into cliques (yawn Anchorman 2) -- hes the last of the triple-threat writer/director/stars and the only one who would make a film as earnest brave and real as The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Yet while Zoolander and Tropic Thunder have clawed into the comedy canon Stiller has money but no respect. Unlike critical darling Judd Apatow hes still stuck at the dweebs table just as he was in 1994 when he asked Ethan Hawkes Troy Dyer ""Have I stepped over some line in the sands of coolness with you?"" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Like the 90s Stiller loves sarcasm -- he even cast himself as the most handsome man in the world -- but his films are sincere within their worlds Derek Zoolander really is a gorgeous model Tropic Thunders Kirk Lazarus is invested in his blackface and even Troy Dyer aches for a connection he isnt mature enough to handle. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty drops all the irony. The story of a shy magazine employee with a magnificent imagination its an uplifting big-hearted crowd-pleaser. Which in todays Hollywood where every superhero has a standing Thursday appointment with a therapist makes it defiantly uncool. The disaffectedness Stiller popularized in Reality Bites is biting him in the ass. Now were all Troy Dyer instantly suspicious of anything that wants to make us feel. Film DetailsCritics Pick The Secret Life of Walter Mitty RatingPG GenreAction/Adventure Running Time125 min. More Info Trailer Stiller has the rare ability to grow or shrink his presence onscreen as the part demands and he makes Mitty a truly ordinary everyman. Hes not a victimized wimp or a bumbling Focker just a guy on the street who quietly fears hes letting life slip through his fingers. In his head Stillers Mitty daydreams of rescuing puppies and making women swoon. At work he gets overlooked by his dream girl (a charmingly mellow Kristen Wiig) and undermined by his new boss played by Adam Scott in a beard so fake it looks like a squirrel clinging to his chin. Scotts facial hair is this worlds only false note. Most comedies are populated by babes and schlubs who look like refugees from Budweiser ads and they have fabulous jobs and even more fabulous apartments. The people around Walter Mitty have crows feet and messy hair. They work at KFC and Nabisco and go home to small walk-ups where they have to squeeze past each other in the kitchen.Related StoriesL.A.s Riot Comedy Festival Could It Become a National Name?It doesnt sound revolutionary until you realize no other comedian is doing it -- even the ones who think they are. When Judd Apatow tries to make something ""honest"" he gives us a hot rich married couple squabbling over cupcakes while Adam Sandlers idea of normal life is a McMansion and courtside tickets to the Lakers. And dont get me started on Woody Allen who thinks all poor people come equipped with Jersey accents and wife-beaters -- in San Francisco. As in the original James Thurber short story Mitty dreams hes leading a more exciting life - a Hollywood fantasy. Here he imagines larger-than-life heroes and toughs in the visual language of film The leaves swirl the music quickens and his eyes burn. This is a movie about a guy who wishes his reality was like the movies which is just one half-step away from Tropic Thunder a movie about movie-makers who dont know their reality is real. Mittys fantasies even look like Tropic Thunders reality -- when he imagines himself as a frost-bitten explorer wooing Wiig with his ""poetry falcon"" hes looks like hes strutted out of his character Tugg Speedmans moronic blockbuster Scorcher VI Global Meltdown. Later he imagines hes starring in a romantic redo of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button but because Mitty hasnt actually seen the film he pictures his old man babyface all wrong. Eventually Mitty sets out on a real adventure to track down wild-man photographer Sean Penn who has more badass creases in his face than a topographical map of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajokull one of the stops on Mittys trek. The film thrills at this quest The National Geographic-quality vistas are almost too distractingly beautiful the indie ballads one synthesizer chord short of emotional overkill. Yet Stiller balances his big ambitions with small grounded truths. On his way to the volcano a flock of crows assembles itself into a Kristen Wiigs face but after the explosion he goes to a Papa Johns and balances his checkbook. Globe trotting aint cheap.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Its in these details that Walter Mitty glows with life. Stiller is a humanist with a keen eye for comic minutia. Even in a sweet moment when Mitty hugs a co-worker goodbye -- something a lesser director would throw in for a cheap ""awwwww"" -- he makes the men awkwardly shuffle a box out of the way. He keys in to what Thurber cautioned Samuel Goldwyn in 1947 the first time the Mitty story made it to film that the tone ""should be kept in a high romantic key and should never descend to anything of a slapstick nature....The dreams will be funny simply and only because they are the true representations of the average mans secret notions of his own great capabilities.""Like Mitty Ben Stiller dreams big. The problem is audiences dont let him. We have a problem dividing Stiller the Actor -- the paycheck-cashing doofus of Night at the Museum -- from Stiller the Director whose last film scored Robert Downey Jr. an Oscar nomination. (For a summer comedy) Stillers in his own Mitty-esque nightmare While his character dreams of being in Tugg Speedmans hits hes suffering through Tugg Speedmans failures making earnest flicks like the ""full retard"" Simple Jack and getting mocked for being sentimental. Hes both famous and forgotten the best comedy director of his generation hiding in plain sight. As Penn advises him in a manly mano-y-mano  ""Beautiful things dont ask for attention."" True. But its time we applaud Ben Stiller anyway.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday December 23 2013 817 PM Title The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Film Info PG Mild language. Area theaters. Dreams not only come true in the wonderful ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" theyre the stuff everyday life is made of. Thats the startling discovery made by its title character (Ben Stiller). Until then the undistinguished Walter is used to living in his own alternate reality zoning out and falling into colorful daydreams. In one he saves the residents of a burning building; in another he fights an enemy superhero-style. Mousy Walter works in the photo department of Life magazine. When we meet him on his 42nd birthday his personal life consists of balancing his checkbook and trying unsuccessfully to connect on a dating site with his co-worker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig). His own profile is broken because he left the ""been there done that"" part blank as hes actually been nowhere and done nothing . Ben Stillers daydreams as Walter Mitty include co-worker Kristen Wiig r. His job presents other crises. Life magazine is shutting down. For its last cover an oafish transition manager (Adam Scott) needs a picture Walter believes is still in the possession of a globe-hopping photographer (Sean Penn). Walter decides to break out of his gray little existence and track down the wayward shutterbug heading to Greenland Iceland and the Himalayas witnessing a volcano eruption and nearly getting eaten by a shark. Ben Stiller hits the road in The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Finally it dawns on Walter that hes become the person he always wanted to be. And thats when itll dawn on viewers that Stiller has found the perfect way to reinterpret a short story filmed once before as a 1947 Danny Kaye lark. Stiller and writer Steve Conrad figured out that Walters journey isnt about wish fulfillment -- it spins on recapturing your own adventurous spirit. As Walter Mitty Ben Stiller has an imagination that works hard to impress Kristen Wiig. Theres plenty of serious silliness (including a Chaplin-esque taser scene) but Stiller gives the film a soul. He and Wiig have a sweet mellow chemistry while stunning landscapes a soulful score and keen supporting work from Patton Oswalt Kathryn Hahn and Penn provide lovely grace notes. The script sometimes jams too much to make all the dots connect but thats a minor fault. The story Stiller tells manages to float in a most peculiar satisfying way.

Theres little soulfulness to his central dreamer a New York City photo archivist about to be downsized by Life magazine (preciously revived from its actual 2000 demise). As an actor Stiller is way too intense to play a tragically blocked everyguy; his walk alone is pushy. Even on the films poorly conceived terms though Walters timidity is barely explained. He has difficulty clicking on eHarmony and reaching out to coworker Kristen Wiig--until of course he doesnt and these problems waft away with little personal reckoning. Cue Wes Anderson-like sequences of skateboarding down a volcanos slope and jetting off to Afghanistan. Youre going to find it all either enormously empowering or deeply calculated an Arcade Fire-scored TV commercial for instant spirituality.

"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty 2.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article The Secret Life of Walter Mitty 2.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Goodykoontz interviews Ben Stiller By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Mon Dec 23 2013 439 PM ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" just doesnt work. Its a beautiful-looking film with a lot of talent in front of the camera including Ben Stiller (who directs as well as stars) Kristen Wiig and in a small role Sean Penn. Its based on a great short story by James Thurber and was made into a well-liked film in 1947 starring Danny Kaye. But this film never adds up. The original story was about a put-upon husband who escaped his shrewish wife by way of rich fantasies. Stillers Mitty also has fantasies. Theyre big expensive-looking set pieces in which for instance he saves a dog from a building thats about to blow up. (Evidently once a movie budget soars past a certain figure an explosion of some kind is required.) But this Mitty leaves fantasy behind and although that is not necessarily a problem its not Mitty. The original character uses his imagination to escape his wretched life. For Stillers Mitty the fantasies are an impetus to experience real adventure. A noble goal perhaps and a decent idea even if it doesnt fit the spirit of the story. The bigger problem is how Mittys fantasies are treated not as a means of escape but as a form of mental illness almost. Late in the film after he has traveled around the globe someone asks Mitty if hes still having those daydreams. Not as often he says with some satisfaction and its kind of sad. In this film Mitty isnt married or dating. Hed like to be specifically with Cheryl (Wiig) his co-worker at Life magazine. He signs up with eHarmony.com the find-a-date website where Todd (played mostly off-camera by Patton Oswalt) one of the people who answers the phones takes a liking to him. But hes got to get out into the world more Todd advises. Have some adventures. Then disaster strikes twice. First Life announces its going digital only; officious downsizing specialist Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott) swoops in like a heavily bearded Grim Reaper. Then superstar photographer Sean OConnell (Penn) sends in a series of photos one of which -- negative No. 25 -- is earmarked for the final cover. But Mitty loses it. OConnell is a lone-wolf sort who doesnt have a cell phone and doesnt really tell anyone where he is. So off goes Walter encouraged by Todd and Cheryl whom he finally gathers the courage to engage with to find OConnell and his photo. He travels to Greenland Iceland and the Himalayas to find the photographer (and the photo). But really of course he is finding himself. And thats rather ho-hum despite the admittedly spectacular settings and the acting which is fine. The film also has a few of Stillers typical quirky touches. Hes a good director -- ""Tropic Thunder"" is a subversive classic -- aiming for something big here. But weve seen plenty of movies where protagonists make a leap of faith to better themselves; in fact we havent seen too many movies where they dont. ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" at least in its original form is about living your life inside your head after circumstances (or weaknesses) trap you there. Its a secret life after all. In this version its all about breaking out getting free taking chances. Theres nothing wrong with that. But theres nothing novel about it either. Director Ben Stiller. Cast Ben Stiller Kristen Wiig Sean Penn. Rating PG for some crude comments language and action violence. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

(Photo by Wilson Webb) By Ann Hornaday December 24 2013 Follow AnnHornaday This has been such an exceptional year in movies that calling a movie ""perfectly likable"" or even ""good"" starts to sound like faint praise. Which means that ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" Ben Stillers contemporary adaptation of the James Thurber story may well get lost in the shuffle of its betters. But that shouldnt detract from the strengths of a film that while imperfect has much to recommend it. As the title character Stiller brings his jut-jawed laser-blue glare to a character who starts off as something of a passive cipher. As a longtime manager for ""negative assets"" at Life magazine Walter processes the magazines photographers celluloid -- in other words hes an obsolete guy working in an obsolete media platform within a soon-to-be all-digital art form. The films opening scene -- wherein Walter hesitantly ""winks"" at a woman on an online dating forum -- makes it clear This is a man working at Life rather than living it. As a bland ineffectual drone harboring fantasies of romance and adventure Stillers Walter is without a doubt a direct descendent from Thurbers 1939 creation. But working with Steve Conrads screenplay Stiller eventually takes enormous liberties with the storys plot which in his hands takes increasingly digressive and literal flights of fancy. Thurber purists will be appalled but as yet another tale of a man coping with the 21st-century onslaught of technology downsizing and alienation ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" feels very much of its time cinematically and otherwise. Because the film is so rooted in present-day anxieties the filmmakers dont need to underline italicize and repeat its message -- crystallized in the oft-repeated Life motto about seeing things ""thousands of miles away"" ""hidden behind walls"" and ""dangerous to come to."" The digressions that Stiller takes as a director dont always bear fruit and the movie -- in which the main plot driver is Walters nascent love for a co-worker played by Kristen Wiig -- ends with an odd whimper especially considering the spectacular set pieces that have gone before. But there are moments of real value in ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty."" Conrad sneaks in lots of clever puns on Life both humorous and dark and the movie benefits from a bright attractive visual design that lingers as lovingly on its most colorful interludes as on the magazines most iconic black-and-white portraits. When a company arrives to oversee the end of the print edition (an effort headed by a tiresomely one-note jerk played by Adam Scott) scenes of the wall-size pictures being de-accessioned suggest an entire history and cultural patrimony being carelessly discarded. And there are passages of astonishing beauty in the film which not only stages impressively produced scenes of daredeviltry within Walters imagination but also situates him against backdrops of magnificent natural scenery. One scene in particular -- involving the David Bowie song ""Space Oddity"" an errant helicopter and a mad dash for redemption -- looks for all the world as if hes flying directly into a Rockwell Kent painting. (The MacGuffin coincides with a charming cameo appearance from a flawlessly cast actor in top self-effacing form.) The unevenness of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" and Stillers recessive characterization of the title character keep it from being an all-out crowd-pleaser. As a similar exploration of being in the moment and staying there Spike Jonzes ""Her"" also opening this week is far more subtle and fully realized. Still theres a winsome attaboy appeal to ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" that deserves to be honored. Its a perfectly likable movie and sometimes thats good enough.   PG. At area theaters.

It takes James Thurbers beloved short story about a man who spends all his time daydreaming of heroic feats in far-away places and expands upon it in the most schematic belabored way. This time out Walter (Ben Stiller who also directed) runs the photo archive at Life magazine. Its a job most people would probably love to have but in Stiller and screenwriter Scott Conrads vision its the ideal purgatorial position for a submerged extra-in-his-own-life type. In this iteration of the story Walter is no longer a henpecked zhlub and more a lovestruck dreamer He wants to go and speak to leggy kindhearted fellow employee Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) but he cant much to the ridicule of the folks around him. Instead he fantasizes about sweeping her off her feet as a lantern-jawed Latin mountain climber who bursts through the walls of the office. Meanwhile the print magazine is going under and a gaggle of evil corporate Internet douche bags are taking over led by a menacingly bearded Adam Scott. (Insert funny dream sequence of Stiller and Scott having a superhero-level combat and chase through Manhattan.) While Walters New Beardo Overlords have no use for great photography they do have a special cover shot planned for the final issue. They want a brilliant final image from their prized photographer Sean OConnell (Sean Penn) a scruffy daredevil who is off having the life Walter secretly wants. Unfortunately the mysterious photo -- which Sean has told Walter represents ""the quintessence of Life"" (ha-ha get it?) -- is missing from his roll of negatives. And so off Walter goes on a real-life journey to track down the elusive adventurous photographer and recover the image. Up until this point Stiller has created clear stylistic distinctions between Walters dream life and his real life -- theres no way not to since the dreams are replete with expensive CGI and explosive climactic face-offs. And when Walter finally goes off on his Excellent Adventure Stiller shoots it as another one of his daydreams accompanied by beautiful emo music and giant signs egging Walter on and everything happening swiftly cleanly as if by magic - like Wes Anderson directing a Nike commercial. And its a huge almost catastrophic misstep. The adventure should resemble real life not just another dream. Otherwise theres no sense of danger and hence no reason to care. Its such a simple conceptual whiff -- but it rots the entire movie from within. As Walter makes hairbreadth escapes from erupting volcanoes falls into raging oceans filled with sharks and runs into Afghan warlords we feel alienated from the action because its all been pitched at the level of unrealistic fantasy. The stakes havent been raised so we never experience the thrill of the moment a problem for a film thats supposed to be all about living life to the fullest. The fake-o shark in Anchorman 2 is scarier. On and on it goes from set piece after set piece. All throughout I kept thinking of Richard Attenboroughs signature line in Jurassic Park ""Weve spared no expense."" Attenboroughs character had thought everything through - except the unpredictable. Stiller for his part seems to have banished the unpredictable entirely from his set. And so he cant keep his movie from being overtaken by the dinosaurs of tedium and ... Anyway I dont exactly know where Im going with this metaphor but you get the idea. Walter Mitty isnt a terrible movie. Its not even a bad one really. Its a pleasant enough diversion - Wiig is adorable Scott is note-perfect the musics nice it looks great and you can marvel at the movies scope. Somebody clearly spent a lot of money on this thing and its all up there on the screen. You want to applaud a comedy that dares to look good that dares to have style and sweep instead of the point-and-shoot-and-improvise-and-stitch-it-together-in-post aesthetic of most comedies today. The movie is so eager to please so desperate to be loved. But it forgets that in order to be loved it needs to surprise us to demonstrate some vulnerability maybe even some imperfection. In short it needs the one thing all the money in Hollywood cant buy -- a soul.

"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty daydream unbeliever Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty daydream unbeliever ReviewThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty starring Ben Stiller who also directs looks great lacks heart.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterTues. Dec. 24 2013The Secret Life of Walter MittyStarring Ben Stiller Kristen Wiig Patton Oswalt Adam Scott and Sean Penn. Directed by Ben Stiller. 114 minutes. Opens Dec. 25 at major theatres. PGLike any cubical jockey who has stared into space and daydreamed a perfect plot of heroism and greatness -- starring them -- Ben Stiller has put himself both at the helm and in nearly every scene of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.If you love the Zoolander star and dont mind that this movie generates the occasional weak smile rather than huge laughs then this self-indulgent CGI-heavy Stiller world tour will make you happy indeed. Article Continued BelowMitty was the central character of the 1947 fantasy starring Danny Kaye based on the very brief James Thurber-penned short story in The New Yorker; the name has become synonymous with dreamers of this world. Now Stiller takes on the tale directing from a script by Steve Conrad (The Pursuit of Happyness The Weather Man). He updates it in sort-of fashion with reclusive Mitty now a bachelor toiling in the decidedly archaic photo negative department of Life magazine. How Mitty has lasted this long on the job in the age of digital photography is a mystery.(In real life the photo-news magazine struggled to stay on newsstands in various forms finally folding in 2007.) Mitty often ""disappears"" to be discovered staring into space while conjuring up acts of invented heroism often inspired by the giant (fabricated) Life covers that line the office walls.Risking his skin in his daydreams is a good antidote for the real danger lurking in the magazines halls. Corporate hatchetmen (led by a snide Adam Scott) have landed and are showing much of the staff the door as Life is repurposed as a web-only publication.Mittys daydreams are also sparked by his secret crush on co-worker Cheryl (a pleasingly low-key Kristen Wiig). Too shy to attempt a workplace meeting hes opted for eHarmony to get her attention but he spends more time chatting with the dating sites online troubleshooter Todd (an ill-used Patton Oswalt) than Cheryl.When the real world disappoints dreaming takes over. In a flash the coffee room at work falls away as Mitty swaps his nerdy putty-coloured windbreaker for vibrant mountain climbing gear and a handsomely ice-covered beard to woo Cheryl by fantastic means. But the exercise is without heart or genuine emotion a missing element that constantly niggles as the film progresses.With the final issue of Life about to go into production Mitty has been tasked with printing the cover photo from a negative sent by reclusive and rebellious superstar photographer and perpetual globetrotter Sean OConnell (Sean Penn).But the precious negative has gone missing and finding it is the only thing standing between Mitty and a layoff notice. Soon Mittys daydreams of feats like asphalt surfing down Manhattan streets morph into real feats of crazed heroics involving helicopters sharks Afghanistan mountain treks volcanoes and skateboard racing along an Icelandic highway as he tries to track down OConnell and that precious final frame.The calculated layering of adventures and heroics all involving long frame-filling close-ups of Mitty looking pensive or wide-eyed show a variety of computer-generated splendours that dont seem to be in service of anything. A The Curious Case of Benjamin Button gag is the most obvious example dropped in for no other reason than to show it can be done. Stillers relentless focus on his own character leaves others poorly realized and the heart of the story pales amid the spectacle. Deeper messages than chasing your dreams are lost to the slick ad campaign-style bigness of the pursuit.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Dec. 24 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Dec. 26 2013 330PM EST Comments AA Directed by Ben Stiller Written by Steve Conrad Starring Ben Stiller Kristen Wiig Sean Penn Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English Walter Mitty first appeared in a James Thurber short story in 1939 when Superman was a year old and little guys were dreaming big.But where Joe Shuster and Jerry Siegels invincible world-saver was a guy too modest to emerge from behind his nebbishy secret identity to take credit for rescuing humankind Mitty dreamed of glory. In his fantasy life he was a Nazi-thwarting pilot a brilliant surgeon and a crusading barrister while in reality Walter was just a henpecked drone who awakens from his reveries of omnipotence to find himself smoking a cigarette outside the store where his battleaxe of a wife is shopping. Video Video Five must-see movies to add to your list this holiday In adapting Mittys tale to the 21st century actor-director Ben Stiller proves Thurber - a dyed-in-the-wool cynic - is still too thorny a sensibility for the popcorn crowd which last saw Walter onscreen incarnated by Danny Kaye in 1947 In that movie as in this one Walter is depicted as a sweet loser whose fantasies permit the saving of the world a hero trapped in a dullards life. Hes the kind of guy who needs movies and comic books in other words a flattering projection of ourselves freed up to straighten up a bent planet.In Stillers movie Walter is a single guy who works at a digitally downsizing Life magazine and imagines himself doing things such as saving a three-legged dog from a burning building.His fantasies are driven by his conviction that people (and puppies) are good and worth saving his interior life a series of episodes in which Walter is unleashed to realize the potential of us all. If Thurbers Mitty was a sad more than slightly bitter three-legged puppy himself Stillers is Superman in search of a telephone booth a force of good comically contained by the dull obligations of making it to lunch hour alive.With his irony ironed out Walter becomes a prisoner of another kind that of Hollywoods insistence of sentimental deliverance and Walter is delivered from one sentence of maximum security ordinariness to another. Theres no bitterness anger or envy driving the guy who just wants to save three-legged puppies from burning buildings and even his imminent professional obsolescence is defined as a romantic disappointment Life is about to go online only and Walter dreams of a time when the hard-copy edition made the world seem a prettier and more noble place.Stretching Thurbers three-page story to near epic two-hour proportions Stiller not only trims the authors prickliness but betrays it rendering a caustic cautionary fable of unfulfilled grandiosity into yet another peon to the undiminished triumph of the human spirit. Stiller whos played irredeemable schmucks before - see especially Greenberg - is here playing it not just safe but supersafe and his movie vaults from any intimations of existential discontent as surely as Walter himself bursts from all manner of spectacular CGI-articulated disaster.In this Secret Life of Walter Mitty our hero fights sharks scrambles mountainsides in Afghanistan and springs whole from erupting volcanoes. He romances the girl of his dreams (Kristen Wiig) and ultimately gets outed as a Superman in average guy drag.Needless to say he doesnt even smoke and cant imagine any life more ordinary than the one of a run-of-the-mill movie hero.

Grade A- Actor-director Ben Stillers witty improbably moving comedy-adventure gives off the giddy visceral feelings you get when going through a mountain tunnel and emerging in a bracing vista. ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" creates an escapist world that grows out of and enriches the real world - and it does so with revitalizing confidence and ease. Its wispy but it sticks with you like a pop tune that flits through your head for an entire season. Stillers update of James Thurbers archetypal daydreamer - played by Stiller himself - toils at a romantic nostalgia-charged version of Life magazine at Time/Life headquarters in Manhattan. Hes a ""negative assets manager"" responsible for preserving filmed images and shepherding them into print. Hes so dedicated to what he does that he doesnt know how good he is. Thats part of why he zones out and imagines himself in outlandish heroic exploits most spectacularly as a super Good Samaritan rescuing his true love (Kristen Wiig) from a flaming building - or saving all of Life from a new manager (Adam Scott) whos been deputized to gut the magazines resources and transform it into an online shadow of its former self. For the print editions final cover Stillers Mitty must find a missing frame from a roll of film. The magazines renowned daredevil photographer Sean OConnell (Sean Penn) has promised it would contain ""the quintessence of life."" So in pursuit of that image Mitty dares to be great taking risks that heretofore he hazarded only in daydreams. His illusion that Wiig an accounts manager in the same department is right there beside him egging him on empowers him to go where no negative assets manager has ever gone before landing within spitting distance of an active volcano in Iceland and later climbing to the lair of the snow leopard in the Himalayas. The movie overflows with love for qualities and experiences that are tactile and personal not digital or virtual. But its not a simple Luddite wish-fulfillment. Mitty gets close to his true love with the help of eHarmony.com and even establishes a real friendship with a customer service rep (Patton Oswalt) who helps him operate and expand his profile page. The movie pleas for people to update technologically without losing their humanity - and to respect the skilled workers who actually built operations everyone now wants to digitize. The film itself is a nimble testament to craftsmanship. The comedy-drama feels novel because Stiller as a director knows when not to stress a moment whether its deliciously snide - Scotts slick barbaric corporate honcho turning to an underling to learn the meaning of ""quintessence"" - or wistful like Mitty misreading what it means when his dream girls ex-husband acts as her handyman. (Its a minor triumph that you never guess that the film will pivot on a pun.) Steve Conrads script deftly mixes melancholy and cleverness particularly when etching in Mittys family life. He began supporting his mother (a blessedly subdued Shirley MacLaine) and sister (the sublimely quirky Kathryn Hahn) with fast-food jobs when he was 17 the year his father died. No wonder he feels funny when he eats at Papa Johns. All the actors make the most of their moments including Wiig whos never been this graceful and straightforward and Hahn whos endearing when she talks about her current goal - playing Rizzo in a gala church-theater production of ""Grease."" As an actor and a director Stiller finds the quiet heroism in this character without blowing it out of proportion. Thanks to his affectingly understated performance and the crisp authority of his direction the details of Mittys life feel right whether its his bit of past glory as a skateboarder or the prime possessions of his 1980s youth like a VHS tape of ""Stripes."" This movie is about savoring escapades that can bring fresh air into a workaday existence without tearing it to shreds. Visually Stiller proves himself a master of synthesis whether hes embedding the opening credits within Manhattans cityscapes turning a TSA search into an X-ray-vision mime show or exploiting the tingling sweep of the wide screen as it fills with ocean spume and volcanic dust. His movie is like a funhouse mirror that leaves people looking better and feeling better too.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Tropic Thunder Ben Stiller sent up the allure of realism in Hollywood dropping a platoon of varyingly method-devoted movie actors into actual violence. While superficially milder Stillers adaptation of James Thurbers gentle 1939 story--a remake producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. reportedly spent decades trying to bring to the screen--can be seen as another wholehearted embrace of fantasy. Thurbers daydreaming hero is now an employee in the photo department at Life magazine. One day after an inventive opening credits sequence he arrives at work to learn the publication has been acquired. In a subtle bit of symbolism Life will soon become Life Online.Theres a hint of sharp satire in the idea that Mittys wandering mind affords him an escape from tough economic times and the movie shot on celluloid doubles as an ode to vanishing analog media. The plot hinges on Mittys search for a missing frame that the magazines best freelance photographer (Sean Penn) considers the finest of his career an image the companys chief downsizer (Adam Scott) has inexplicably agreed to use on the last cover despite not having seen it. Par for the course Mitty also pines for a co-worker (Kristen Wiig) but doesnt have the guts to ask her out. Its once the daydreams stop and Mitty jets off to Greenland in search of Penns itinerant shutterbug (and ""actual"" adventure) that the film takes an unexpected turn for the dull. Abandoning its more original elements the movie opts for a banal carpe diem conceit that turns Mitty into a globetrotting bystander with few opportunities to cut loose a la Danny Kaye. Stiller visits Greenlands only karaoke bar jumps out of a drunken pilots plane and--in a truly tasteless interlude--delivers moms (Shirley MacLaine) cake to Afghan warlords. Also like product placement? Whether its plugging Cinnabon (""like frosted heroin"") casting an eHarmony tech support guy as a life-advice guru or using Papa Johns to represent a crucial moment in Mittys lost youth The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty negates its anti-corporate handwringing with an unabashed use of advertising--and not in the cleverly employed Orange Mocha Frappuccino manner of Stillers Zoolander. Nothing is as absurd however as the wish-fulfillment finale. Talk about using your illusions.

Or on the work of art it was adapted from? As Hollywood looks harder and wider for pre-sold properties it raises fiercer and louder protests from fans who cling to their memories of the original books. How could you cast her as Katniss? goes the cry. Or him as Christian Grey? Those are the obvious objections -- and often they fade away once the movie opens. But theres a different kind of truthfulness thats even more important and often just as ignored The primary sources intent. ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is a very short story by James Thurber first published in 1939; basically its a character sketch of a bullied husband who escapes his dull life (and nagging wife) by slipping into daydreams where hes a daring square-jawed hero. Like so much of Thurbers work beneath the jokes its really a melancholy mood piece about inconsequential men and the formidable women who run their lives; its not meant to evoke a smile as much as a wince. Which of course is why when Hollywood first turned it into a film they made it into a big Danny Kaye comedy. I cant share the affection so many others feel for Kaye; his love-me-love-me-love-me antics always struck me as too nakedly attention-craving even for a Catskills comic. So I saw no blasphemy in the story being remade again this time by Ben Stiller. Yet it feels the same need to involve its quiet hero in real-life adventures to write in a romance to put an upbeat twist on things and of course to have him triumph at the end. Which is so far from the point of the original ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" you wonder what Stiller ever even liked about it besides the title. The film starts with a nicely slow deadpan scene of Stillers Mitty -- a very quiet and precise bachelor -- hesitating to even click on an internet dating site. The credits -- the titles hidden among anonymous NY cityscapes -- are promising too. You begin to think this could be a great film -- if only Spike Jonze were directing. Instead though the movie takes a few strange turns. It gives Mitty a job in the darkroom at Life magazine (which in this strange parallel world is still a regular periodical). It folds in a quick ""Benjamin Button"" parody (which not only feels a bit out of date but better suited to ""Tropic Thunder"" or even Stillers old TV show.) And then it plunges Mitty into a hunt for a missing negative -- which preposterously takes him from Iceland to Afghanistan with sharks an erupting volcano and fearsome warlords along the way. N.J. NEWS ON THE GO Our redesigned mobile site has quick page loads and app-style navigation and lets you join the conversation with comments and social media. Visit NJ.com from any mobile browser. There are some expansive vistas and obviously expensive effects but Steve Conrads script misses the point of the fable just as widely as the Danny Kate movie did. Its bad enough to have Mitty stop daydreaming which runs contrary to the whole spirit of the original story but its absolutely disastrous to have him stop for the wrong reasons. Mitty shouldnt give up his fantasies because real life becomes a fantasy but because real life becomes enough; any other message is no message at all. Stiller is fine in the early sadsack scenes (although having him turn into a fearless adventurer doesnt convince). Kristen Wiig is a nice offbeat choice as his love interest; at least shes not the twenty-something ""manic pixie dreamgirl"" other comedies would insist on. There are a few appealing guest-star cameos and Adam Scott who plays a corporate villain has a marvelously insane beard. But too much of this movie is either over-the-top (like a Manhattan-trashing superhero battle) or widely offtrack. And theres something slightly hypocritical about it as well -- preaching respect for the simple life even as its crammed full of overpriced visuals and larded with painfully obvious product placements. Im surprised that Stiller liked the real ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" and pleased that this movie may drive even more people to read it. But what I really desperately hope is that some of them even understand it -- at least more than Stiller did. Ratings note The film contains violence.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A habitual daydreamer finds himself forced to dive headfirst into adventure. Rated PG (mild language) BOTTOM LINE Director-star Stiller plays Mitty as a zoned-out sad sack surrounded by whimsy. The result is a confused dramedy that isnt funny or compelling enough to make us care. CAST Ben Stiller Kristen Wiig Sean Penn LENGTH 154 The spaced-out hero of Ben Stillers ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" has a workplace nickname Major Tom. You know the astronaut in David Bowies ""Space Oddity"" who disconnects from Ground Control and drifts into infinity. Walter Mitty a chronic daydreamer tends to do that too. The moniker fits a little too well. In this scattered distracted update of the 1939 James Thurber story and of the 1947 film starring Danny Kaye Stiller directs himself as Mitty a depressed Gen-Xer who frequently retreats into ""Thor""-style action-fantasies. In reality hes a photo handler at Life magazine which is being shuttered by cold-blooded consultant Ted Hendricks (Adam Scott). The picture destined for Lifes final cover has disappeared and Mitty must find it even if that means a globe-hopping search for the famous photographer who took it Sean OConnell (Sean Penn). Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Perhaps youre thinking ""Huh?"" If so thats because this ""Mitty"" written by Steven Conrad tries to jam together Thurbers tragicomic portrait and Kayes whimsical comedy (which Thurber loathed) while concocting yet a third version that aims to resonate with modern viewers. The movie gives Mitty a punk-rock past but this detail doesnt jibe with a character who works at an Eisenhower-era glossy. It seems clear that Mitty has been bland his entire life No matter whats happening around him he barely changes his expression. That gets tiresome since Mitty is essentially the movies only character. Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) Mittys workplace crush is an afterthought; Shirley MacLaine barely registers as his mother Edna; and Penn as the deeply world-weary OConnell seems unaware that hes in a comedy. Stiller may not be fully aware either. He has directed some sharp comedies (""Zoolander"" ""Tropic Thunder"") but here he goes for a slick commercial style indistinguishable from any number of middlebrow Hollywood heart-tuggers. In its confusion ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" grabs at straws. In a crucial scene Cheryl encourages Mitty by telling him that Major Tom is really a figure of courage -- a perversely upbeat reading of Bowies druggy tragic ballad. But Mitty never one to face reality believes her. 247 MoviesSecret Life of Walter Mitty trailer PLOT A habitual daydreamer finds himself forced to dive headfirst into adventure. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (mild language) CAST Ben Stiller Kristen Wiig Sean Penn LENGTH 154 BOTTOM LINE Director-star Stiller plays Mitty as a zoned-out sad sack surrounded by whimsy.

But by trying to combine fantasy and romance with goofy humor globe-trotting adventure and feel-good inspiration Stiller has made Mitty a mixed bag of clashing tones and facile redemption.He bypasses Thurbers satirical treatment in favor of plodding earnestness. Stillers is an undeniably attractive production with gorgeous locations and some stunning special effects. But its a dull story.In the 1947Mitty movie which starred Danny Kaye Walter drove safely around town with his wife while his adventurous escapades remained firmly and unequivocally inside his head.In Stillers version Walter has a crush on Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) a down-to-earth co-worker. Hes a photo editor at Life magazine where hes bullied by an obnoxious new boss (Adam Scott) and mocked by co-workers. Peripatetic photographer Sean OConnell (Sean Penn) however speaks only to Walter at the magazine.Walters far-flung expeditions are focused on retrieving a photo negative to be used in the magazines final print edition. The adventures serve more symbolically to help him break out of a lifelong rut. He dodges an erupting volcano in Iceland and climbs the Himalayas with nary a misstep. He even plays soccer with sherpas. Yet his journey is un-involving and occasionally convoluted.Stiller was aiming for this effort to be substantive complex and thoughtful. Some of the smaller moments work but the epic sequences particularly in the climactic meeting with OConnell on a towering mountain fall flat. And in his endeavor to make a crowd-pleasing feel-good movie Stiller blunts the edges and subtlety.Though the film is ambitious on most fronts Stiller inexplicably made Walter a vague character. Hes somewhere between an Everyman and a comic goofball but not enough of either. For some reason this meek middle-aged man can do showy skateboard tricks worthy of Shaun White. Other than that hes bland genial sporadically funny and long-suffering but rarely engaging.The blatant product placement -- online dating site eHarmony and Papa Johns Pizza -- injects a calculated quality to a film meant to be sincere and poignant.Those who enjoyed Stiller in the Night at the Museum movies might find this sentimental entertainment appealing. But fans of his wacky absurd comedies such as Tropic Thunder or Zoolander will find this more serious Stiller disappointingly bland. 119 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 27 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1c1tv6U",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/12/22/secret-life-of-walter-mitty-review/3553163/,200,thesecretlifeofwaltermitty28,thesecretlifeofwaltermitty,usatoday

MOVIE REVIEW The Secret Life of Walter Mitty Running time 125 minutes. Rated PG (crude comments profanity mild peril). Opens Dec. 24 at the Lincoln Square the Kips Bay others. ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is the story of a guy who never goes anywhere or does anything. Until he goes everywhere and does everything but he might as well have stayed home. And I wished he had because then the filmmakers wouldnt have pretended that they had a movie. This meaningless excuse for special-effects spending is like watching a wheezing arthritic horse dragging a tractor-trailer full of big-budget digital equipment. Mitty who first appeared in a 1939 James Thurber short story is now a photo editor for Life magazine (which is just about to shut up shop in this movie telling you how many years its been in development) who is longing to talk to a cute co-worker (Kristen Wiig). The first 20 or 30 minutes repeat the same damp gag again and again The shy little hobbit imagines hes this or that dashing hero from the cover of Life swaggering in to impress Cheryl (Wiig) a soulful single mom who might or might not still be involved with her sons dad. None of these ""it was just a daydream"" scenes do anything to advance the story. The effects are so empty that I half expected Stillers arctic explorer dude to present a York Peppermint Patty and command us ""Get the sensation."" Mittys fantasy life never gets tied to his romantic one He gently strikes up a friendship with Cheryl and before long the pair are taking walks together. Nevertheless the movie (directed by Stiller in what looks like one of his last desperate reaches for artistic importance) begins hinting that theres more to this schlub than his meager existence would suggest. First hint He can do skateboard tricks none of which (oh the bitter irony) are witnessed by Cheryl. But why would a middle-aged mom be impressed by a suitors ability to manage a skateboard anyway? The skill seems merely a strange attempt to pander to 12-year-old boys at the multiplex. Hey kids come see this pale laughless little comedy Theres a skateboarding 48-year-old in it On a dim pretext involving a macho photographer (Sean Penn) who is carrying the worlds greatest photo which Walter needs to track down to put it on the final issue of Life the little man is soon roaming the world for real adventures like the ones he dreamed of. If you can figure out a plausible reason for Mitty to be bobbing about in the frigid North Atlantic fighting a shark youre way ahead of the screenwriter. What Walter wants -- the girl -- is back home in New York and she doesnt care whether he hiked the Himalayas or dodged a volcano eruption in Iceland. The only obstacle between them has nothing to do with his courage or life experience but could be cleared up with a single question ""Are you seeing anyone?"" That this movie got made at all demonstrates that Hollywood thinks that if it can design a project so as to yield half a dozen different digital sequences for the trailer no one will much care about whether they add up to anything. Walters fantastic trip to faraway lands of adventure was superfluous making his movie ""The Wizard of Zzzzzz.""

Stillers Mitty is a photo researcher at Life magazine who escapes his humdrum existence by imagining himself in swashbuckling situations - giving Stiller a fantastic excuse for breathtaking locations show-off effects and Kristen Wiig as the secret object of his affections. When Mitty is faced with redundancy he turns his dreams into reality travelling the globe to find a lost negative for the magazines final cover. And so Mittys far-fetched dreams come true - and the underlying you-can-do-it message is laid on pretty thick. The film is at its best when played as goofy comedy (theres a great Benjamin Button-style moment when we see Stiller as an elderly baby). The later country-hopping scenes feel like flicking through an old copy of National Geographic only to find Sean Penn (playing the mysterious photographer who snapped the missing shot) lurking in its pages as the paragon of outsider authenticity. Cloying at times - but always good-natured.

He is a man that has been marginalised by all around and left behind quite ironically by life itself. Mitty is plagued by missed opportunities and battles through life like most of us do. What should be a sad story turns into one of discovery overcoming and victory and Stiller does an excellent job making Walter an inspiration on screen. For me this is what great filmmaking is all about; executing a motion picture that lingers under your skin long after the credits have rolled. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty does exactly that.

Walter a shy and timid man is an ordinary Joe living an average rather mundane life as a photographic researcher at Life magazine. Hidden in a dimly lit basement he spends his days compiling and editing the work of renowned photographers who have travelled the world visiting incredible exotic locations while undertaking remarkable achievements for the sake of their art. Walter meanwhile squanders his days zoning in and out of his boring existence into a fantastical dream world which is filled with action romance and heroism. Mittys dreams become a reality when he is faced with the task of finding a missing negative for the magazines final cover. His globe trotting adventure sees him travel to some incredible places which are beautifully shot luxuriating in some glorious scenery accompanied by an outstanding laid back soundtrack. The film is a heart-warming story with plenty of laugh out loud moments and sentimental messages to encourage you to become who you really want to be and to live your dream. While some may see that as corny the reason it works is because Mitty is a character you can relate to and believe in.

FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 17 2013Gav DuffyFeaturedA slightly unbalanced but nevertheless heart-warming movie that is clearly quite important to Ben Stiller - director and lead of the film. The mood changes back and forth between epic moments with shots of the Himalayas and erupting volcanoes to more slapstick comedy with Stiller entering into a superhero action throw-down with his new boss. In the spirit of the latter a particular highlight is when Stillers character tells love interest Kristen Wiig how he has ""that disease that Benjamin Button had"" and his imagination plays out a life-long love story ending with Stiller as a ""weird baby"" Four stars a good one to watch over the Christmas break.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 17 2013PetraFeaturedAmazing feel good movie.

Im not entirely convinced that the Forrest Gump comparisons really do it justice as the main protagonist is less naive and more world-weary allowing those of a similarly jaded outlook to engage with Mitty more broadly as an audience than Gump. Ben Stiller is a very likeable lead and the supporting cast are excellent entertainment - particularly an obnoxiously awful Adam Scott and an enjoyable Patton Oswalt with a dreadful sense of timing.

By Anthony Lane Joaquin Phoenix stars in a new movie directed by Spike Jonze.   Credit Illustration by Owen Freeman The hero of ""Her"" should be Him. Instead he bears the name of Theodore Twombly who sounds like the kind of nebbish that Preston Sturges used to dream up in his bath. Theodore is played by Joaquin Phoenix complete with a tragicomic mustache and a selection of unwise shirts. Those are not his fault but the fashion of the day like the high-waisted pants worn by all the men. Spike Jonzes movie which was shot in Los Angeles and Shanghai is set in a near but dateless future where the rough edges of existence have been rubbed away. The colors of clothes and furnishings though citrus-bright are diluted by the pastel softness of the lighting so that nothing hurts the eye. People ride in smoothly humming trains not belching cars. And Theodores cell phone reminds you of those slender vintage cases for cigarettes and visiting cards; if the ghost of Steve Jobs is watching he will glow a covetous green. This little flat box plus an earpiece that Theodore plugs in whenever he wakes up or cant sleep is his portal. It links him to OS1 ""the first artificially intelligent operating system"" which is newly installed on his computer. More than that ""its a consciousness"" with a voice of your choice and a rapidly evolving personality which grows not like a baby or a library but like an unstoppable alien spore. Theodores version is called Samantha and practically her first request is ""You mind if I look through your hard drive?"" She tidies his e-mails reads a book in two-hundredths of a second fixes him up on a date and when that goes badly has sex with him--aural sex so to speak but Theodore will take what he can get. No surprise really given that the role of Samantha is spoken by Scarlett Johansson. Had Jonze picked the voice of Marge Simpson say the film would have turned out very differently. As with all good science fiction the plot is locked into the moral and physical landscape. That is why Theodores friends are unfazed by his other half. Paul (Chris Pratt) proposes a double date with his girlfriend who chats to Samantha through the camera eye on Theodores phone while for Amy (Amy Adams) who already works in video-gaming and who has split from her dolt of a husband the notion of computer-generated desire sounds ideal. The only dissenter is Catherine (Rooney Mara) who was married to Theodore. They are finalizing their divorce and over lunch she mocks the solipsism of his new relationship. Mara is smart casting here; she more or less reprises her role from ""The Social Network"" in which she called Mark Zuckerberg an asshole and makes you wonder how far it is from Facebook to a world in which Theodore is the norm. What makes ""Her"" so potent is that it does to us what Samantha does to Theodore. We are informed cosseted and entertained and yet we are never more than a breath away from being creeped out. Just because someone browses your correspondence in a mood of flirtatious bonhomie doesnt make her any less invasive; and just because you have invited her to do so doesnt mean that you are in control. Who would have guessed after a year of headlines about the N.S.A. and about the porousness of life online that our worries on that score--not so much the political unease as a basic ontological fear that our inmost self is possibly up for grabs--would be best enshrined in a weird little romance by the man who made ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Where the Wild Things Are""? And it is romantic Theodore and Samantha click together as twin souls not caring that one soul is no more than a digital swarm. Sad kooky and daunting in equal measure ""Her"" is the right film at the right time. It brings to full bloom what was only hinted at in the polite exchanges between the astronaut and HAL in ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and toward the end as Samantha joins forces with like minds in cyberspace it offers a seductive nonviolent answer to Skynet the system in the ""Terminator"" films that attacked its mortal masters. We are easy prey not least when we fall in love. The human heart is where the tame things are. After watching ""Her"" why bother with ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty""? The problem is not just that ""Her"" is a better film but that its a better Walter Mitty film--a more ambitious way of addressing the state of Mittyhood. When James Thurber published the original story in this magazine in 1939 it lasted for two pages and nothing happened; Mitty drove around town with his wife. His exploits--as a fighter ace as a surgeon and so on--stayed inside his head and refused to spring free. If his name has endured it is because his plight is eternal. His ancestor was J. Alfred Prufrock who talked of ""sea-girls wreathed with seaweed"" but never met any which was probably a good thing and his descendant is Theodore Twombly who can lie alone and sweet-talk his beloved without having to risk a kiss. All of which is tough on the new Walter Mitty played by Ben Stiller. This Walter does have reveries including the rescue of a three-legged dog from an exploding building but they dwindle after half an hour leaving Stiller--who directs as well as stars--to fill the time. The same dilemma greeted Danny Kaye when he took the role in 1947. Having exhausted his heroic imagination Walter swelled into an actual hero for the rest of the movie and the same applies here as he jets to Greenland and Afghanistan leaps from helicopters and tussles with sharks. So much for Mitty the non-achiever. At least Kaye was up against a decent villain Boris Karloff no less whose opening line was ""I know of a way to kill a man and leave no trace."" Stillers manly task is--wait for it--to find an errant photographer (Sean Penn) who doesnt have a cell phone. I thought I would faint from excitement. The result may be the oddest film of the season. It boasts an array of sublime backdrops and a yearning score but the climate of feeling is anxious and inward encapsulated in Stillers darting gaze and the movie itself keeps glancing backward at the lost and the obsolete. Walter works at Life which is closing down and preparing its farewell issue. His grail as he hops the globe is a single negative from a strip of 35-mm. film. This air of elegy infects the story and sucks the fun out of it. It kills a beautiful idea and leaves no trace. There are two stories in ""Saving Mr. Banks."" The first begins in 1961 at the end of a twenty-year campaign by Walt Disney (Tom Hanks) to bring ""Mary Poppins"" to the screen. Hitherto the author P. L. Travers (Emma Thompson) has stated that she will not be moved lest Mary and her other creations be traduced or stretched into what she calls ""silly cartoons."" Now however in need of money she flies to Los Angeles there to be wooed into signing. In short this is not a film about a film but a film about winning the rights to a book. In fifty years time will audiences thrill to ""J. K. Rowling and the Contractual Clause of Fire""? The other story of which we see frequent clips in our heroines memory unfolds in Australia in 1906 where the young Travers--whose actual name was Helen Goff--moves with her family to a farmhouse. She has a harassed mother (Ruth Wilson) and an alcoholic father (Colin Farrell) who works in a bank and whom despite everything she adores. His first name is Travers which explains a lot. Indeed the entire movie is less of a drama and more of a prolonged explanation lightly therapeutic and Poppins-neat. The cause of Traverss long-concealed distress and its blithe effect on her fiction and on Disneys eventual film are clipped together as crisply as a hook and eye. ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is itself a Disney product and you have to admire its nerveless promotional chutzpah--the way in which the narrative arc bends upward after Travers has been whisked to Disneyland and the tender (though invented) visit that Walt pays to her London home. It is the case that she was upset at the premiere of ""Mary Poppins"" though the tears that we see were not an outpouring of catharsis as the new film suggests but a burst of exasperation. And yet ""Saving Mr. Banks"" does the trick. We have to endure Colin Farrell who looks uncomfortable sounds un-Australian and even makes an unconvincing drunk. On the other hand theres a kick and a lilt to the scenes in which Travers ears pricked for solecism listens to the Sherman brothers (B. J. Novak and Jason Schwartzman) as they canter through their songs. The director is John Lee Hancock who does what he did with ""The Blind Side"" where he commandeered a true and jagged tale tidied up the trauma and made sure that everyone lived sappily ever after. Sandra Bullock carried the day then and now Emma Thompson repeats the process. ""Sun came out to say hello to you"" Traverss driver (Paul Giamatti) says as she arrives in Los Angeles. ""Dont be preposterous"" she replies and the movie is revived by that testiness and wit--the same qualities that rang through the fantastical briskness of the Poppins novels. Just as Mary rescued the wilting Banks family so Thompson saves the film. A spoonful of her medicine makes the sugar go down.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

TWITTER Ben Stiller directs and stars in this long-gestating remake of the 1947 Danny Kaye comedy about a daydreaming everyman based on James Thurbers short story. NEW YORK - A lyrical comic fable about releasing the exceptional qualities trapped within ordinary people Ben Stillers The Secret Life of Walter Mitty expands upon the classic James Thurber short story updating it to the age of corporate downsizing and dehumanizing job elimination. Premiering at the New York Film Festival ahead of Foxs wide Christmas Day release the films pleasures may be too minor-key and its pace too meandering to conquer the mainstream. But audiences willing to tune in to its blend of surreal fantasy droll comedy and poignancy will be rewarded. Originally published in The New Yorker in 1939 Thurbers 21/2-page story entered the American lexicon; the title characters name became a byword for an ineffectual person who indulges in escapist heroic daydreaming. After contributing script notes that went unused Thurber distanced himself from the 1947 film version which became a sideshow for star Danny Kaye to exhibit his gifts in comedic or musical vignettes that more often than not brought the story to a halt. PHOTOS 25 of Falls Most Anticipated Movies Enders Game Catching Fire The Wolf of Wall Street and More The remake project has kicked around for years at various times attracting interest from directors including Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard. And while Stillers version is too tonally diffuse to be fully satisfying its nonetheless a valid take on the material using Thurbers story more as a jumping off point than a solid foundation. Screenwriter Steven Conrad departs from both the prose source and the previous film in this new adaptation. He maintains the core theme of the liberating power of the imagination but tethers even Walters most improbable fantasies to the real potential within him to fully engage with the world and be the kind of man he always dreamed of being. Doubling as director and lead actor Stiller imbues the character with the profound yearning and gnawing frustration of a man hijacked by melancholy circumstance from being a cool kid in his youth to a meek drone in adult life. His dazed confusion as to how that happened gives heart to the understated performance. Walter works at a contemporary incarnation of Life Magazine the office interiors of which are recreated with Mad Men-like retro detailing by production designer Jeff Mann. The buildings sterile corridors contrast with the blown-up covers depicting great men and women and majestic images all of which feed Walters active fantasy life. PHOTOS New York Film Festival 2013 13 Movies to Know In reality he lacks the nerve to speak to Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) a co-worker and recently separated mother who has caught his eye. But with new owners transitioning from print to digital and a supercilious incoming manager (Adam Scott) looking to cut jobs Walters window of opportunity to make a move is closing. When he inadvertently loses a negative from the magazines enigmatic star photojournalist Sean OConnell thats been designated for the final issues cover Walter is forced to take action. Elevated by the spectacular location work of cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh Walters journey takes him first to Greenland and from there to volcanic Iceland. In a second trip he travels to the Upper Himalayas where he finally tracks down OConnell (an expertly judged extended cameo by Sean Penn) gleans a fresh perspective on living in the moment and gets to play soccer with sherpas. Composer Theodore Shapiros score is deftly augmented with symphonic indie alt-rock and beautiful vocal tracks by neo-folkie Jose Gonzalez breathing epic scope into whats at heart a small New York fairy tale. While this duality is not entirely germane to the material theres enough idiosyncratic charm in the treatment to ride over the languorous patches of a movie that pushes close to two hours. PHOTOS Ben Stiller Show Alumni Where Are They Now? A jokey reference to The Curious Case of Benjamin Button at one point underlines some similarities to that film which also mushroomed out of a work of short fiction by an iconic American writer working in a fabulist vein. Stillers film is altogether less grandiose and less saccharine its sweetness emerging without undue strain. The gradual shift by which lonely Walters fantasies recede as his real life becomes more dynamic is modulated with disarming gentleness. More or less playing straight man Wiig gives a quiet appealing performance as a woman no less thwarted by the burdens of everyday existence than Walter; her ability to see past his awkwardness adds emotional warmth. Shirley MacLaine lends a welcome grounded presence to Walters mother and Patton Oswalt makes an amusing appearance as an eHarmony technician obsessively following up on Walters customer-service complaint. Befitting a film in which the heros imaginary acts of derring-do are loosely rooted in reality the sharp CGI sequences are integrated into the naturalistic mainframe with crisp bold colors giving a heightened look to the New York locations.

Sometimes daydreams do come true. At least thats what the Goldwyn family must be feeling now that their long-delayed ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" update finally exists smarter and less screwball than previous attempts at the material have been. After nearly two decades of rewrites and recasting -- during which Jim Carrey Owen Wilson Mike Myers and Sacha Baron Cohen were each attached -- the role falls to Ben Stiller who also directs. Rather than channeling James Thurbers satirical tone Stiller plays it mostly earnest spinning what feels like a feature-length ""Just Do It"" ad for restless middle-aged auds on whom its reasonably commercial prospects depend.This story first appeared in the October 15 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. In the 74 years since Thurbers short story appeared in The New Yorker the name Walter Mitty has become synonymous with banal men who harbor delusions of heroism -- which is practically the only thing Steven Conrads script takes from the brief (two-and-a-half pages) and virtually plotless source material. Here Walter works in the photo department of Life magazine which has just been acquired by a squad of bearded beancounters led by Adam Scott tasked with overseeing the final print issue. Though the shakeup at the magazine means that most of the staff will lose their jobs Walters overnight awakening owes more to his recent crush on a new co-worker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig). Frankly its a miracle that Walter still has a job stashed away like ""Office Space""s Milton at a dimly lit desk managing camera negatives in a world where few still shoot on celluloid. Its a bizarrely old-fashioned choice for this modern reimagining considering that the real Life ceased publishing in 2000 (followed by a short revival as a weekly Parade-style newspaper insert) but also poignant in its own way. After all Life is precisely what Walter has been missing out on during his 16 years of faithful service which makes the magazines motto -- ""...to see the world (and) things dangerous to come to..."" -- an appropriate mantra for his first real adventure. Tasked with tracking down the ""quintessential"" cover image from the magazines star photog (a perfectly cast Sean Penn whom we already assume spends more time thrill-seeking than shaving) Walter flies to Greenland and starts jumping out of helicopters swimming with sharks and skateboarding toward an erupting volcano -- the sort of derring-do that makes his imagination look positively tame by comparison. Such activities also far outstrip anything Danny Kaye tried in the more overtly comic 1947 version produced by Samuel Goldwyn Sr. But just because Stiller has access to CGI doesnt mean hes hell-bent on using it. Naturally vfx factor into Walters fantasies including an asphalt-surfing fight sequence that would be right at home in an Avengers movie but the action remains mostly this side of cartoonish. If anything the most impressive visual trick involves the pics unique way of integrating text -- from the opening credits to an SMS message -- into Walters environment. As far back as 1939 Thurbers story already owed a certain debt to cinema fading in and out of Walters reveries the way moving pictures did. In the time since filmmakers have developed what might as well be called the ""Walter Mitty effect"" a guaranteed laugh-getter wherein mild-mannered characters indulge an aggressive or romantic fantasy -- such as attacking the boss or kissing the girl -- only to snap back to reality the moment things start to get interesting. Rather than clearly indicating each of Walters daydreams at the outset Stiller allows the poor guy to drift seamlessly into his hallucinations while slowly pumping more excitement into his daily routine over the course of the film. Early on its pretty easy to tell when a wall of the Life building crumbles away to reveal Walter as a rugged mountain climber professing his love for Cheryl via ""poetry falcon."" However by the time Walter finds himself thrashing in sub-zero seas screaming as the porpoise fins close in around him auds can scarcely distinguish where fantasy ends and reality begins. While theres something wonderfully relatable about a moth who dreams of being a butterfly Stiller seems curiously reluctant to let himself appear as drab as the nebbish demands. In Thurbers writing his proxies were typically ill at ease absent-minded and hen-pecked by dominant wives (on that front none can top Henry Fondas turn in ""The Male Animal"") but theres virtually no trace of that personality to be found here. A gray coat does not a wallflower make and Stiller passes up a perfectly good opportunity to let Walters mother (Shirley MacLaine) and sister (Kathryn Hahn) dominate his character. Apart from Walters daydreams and a running series of customer-service calls to the eHarmony online dating service (where Patton Oswalt lends amusing support) Conrads script downplays the comedy in favor of a mellow existential crisis of the sort Cameron Crowe characters routinely suffer -- not a shock coming from the sentimentalist responsible for ""The Weather Man"" and ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" Though Stiller has proven he can be much funnier (a ""Benjamin Button""-inspired reverse-aging fantasy suggests what might have been reflecting the uproarious sensibility of his long-gone TV sketch series) the emotional dimension ultimately makes the film feel more substantial. So does location shooting that lets Walters world travels -- to Greenland Iceland and Noshaq mountain Afghanistan -- trump his earlier fantasies while providing backdrops that still look relatively exotic to seen-it-all auds. From a technical perspective this is Stillers slickest pic yet demonstrating creative widescreen framing and an inspired blend of dramatic score and recent pop tunes throughout. While the confusing mix of genres and ideas might throw first-wave auds for a loop the approach is timeless enough to hold up. Who knows? In 20 years the death of Life might seem less outdated and Walters awakening could be as profound as he imagines.

Reply Replyer says October 5 2013 at 755 pm Well that was a horrible film review. You summarized so much of the plot I had to skim most of this to avoid spoilers and then instead of providing any conclusion as to whether it was a good film or not you decided to give some observations on the films meaning. Please look up the definition of ""review"" stop spoiling the plot to fill a work count and instead of writing to be witty give some semblance of an opinion.

A visually playful enlightenment drama thats so preoccupied with inspiring its audience that it never bothers articulating a coherent message to inspire them with Stillers film so consistently undercooks its cheap Hallmark sentiments that none of these pseudo-rousing peans to the inherent wonder of being alive ever congeal into anything meaningful. Originally the tale of an unhappily married dreamer stuck in a ho-hum existence ""Walter Mitty"" has been repurposed as a contemporary romantic fable about an unhappily single daydreamer who works as a ""Negative Assets Manager"" at LIFE Magazine. Walter (Stiller) lives in a Harlem apartment with no art on the walls and seems incapable of any recognizable human emotion save for mild frustration and simmering self-pity - wearing a colorless wardrobe and an immovably blank look on his face he isnt ordinary so much as he is autistically inexpressive (its not enough that he has a fantastical inner life he must also have an aggressively standard outer life). We first meet our reserved hero brimming with unrealized potential as he fires up his new E-Harmony account and agonizes over whether or not to ""wink"" at his co-worker Cheryl (Kristen Wiig so subdued as the bland love interest that shes practically somnambulant). This droll prologue anticipates a movie thats curiously obsessed with the intersection between business models and human lives Steven Conrads script bending over backwards to forgive corporate culture by revealing its underlying personhood. ""Walter Mitty"" repeatedly grafts personhood onto products beginning with the opening credits sequence in which our hero forms a relationship with a concerned E-Harmony employee named Todd (a disembodied Patton Oswalt). Later on Papa Johns will be used as a conduit for Mitty to convey how his life changed in the wake of his fathers death Air Greenland will take to the skies as the official airline of realizing your fantastical destiny and Cinnabon will be contrived into the plot as the sugary source of all human happiness. On the other hand LIFE begins to die the moment we see Walter arrive at work. Faintly echoing the magazines actual collapse in 2000 the film opens with the journalistic institution beginning to transition from print to digital resulting in a brutal series of layoffs overseen by a ghoulish HR stooge named Ted (Adam Scott whose usually hilarious douchebag schtick is grating and out of place here). Weeping crocodile tears for the analog world in our wake ""Walter Mitty"" is a movie about THE WAY WE LIVE NOW and you can feel it becoming less relevant with every passing scene. Walter whos handled all of the magazines negatives for 16 years receives a batch of shots from renowned photographer Sean OConnell (Sean Penn) one of which is destined to be the cover image for the final issue. The problem is that the picture which supposedly contains the ""quintessence of life"" is missing from the sheet that Sean delivered. Under threat of being fired Walter is tasked with locating the elusive globe-hopping photographer and retrieving the mythical frame. His journey takes him to Greenland Yemen and every conceivable corner of his overactive imagination as he jumps out of helicopters and clumsily stumbles over metaphors in an attempt to realize that - to quote the press notes - ""a life discovered is better than a life imagined."" Never mind that the sentiment completely dismisses the point of Thurbers (very) short story and feels like a big fk you to storytellers in general Stillers film is naive and desperately lacking nuance in its own right. The message that even the most beautiful dreams are useless if theyre never realized is problematically broad as it is but ""Walter Mitty"" distills cheap sentiment into utter meaninglessness by conflating ""living"" with ""engaging in implausibly reckless behavior."" Allowing a drunk helicopter pilot to fly him into the heart of a storm brewing above the Arctic Ocean long-boarding towards an erupting volcano eating a Cinnabon - If Sean OConnell is a Herzogian caricature Walter Mitty is Timothy Treadwell a sweet idiot whose increasingly distorted view of the world around him is more dangerous than it is endearing. While the films visual whimsy is clever and impressively conceived (its clear that Stiller could have a second career directing a wide variety of studio fare if not for his irrepressible wackiness) the low-concept quirks tend to work best and watching a text message formed by the shifting earth of an Icelandic rockslide is cringe-inducing proof that ""Walter Mitty"" is ironically a victim of its own imagination. Though a few vintage Stiller moments help the film retain a unique off-kilter energy (a weird long riff on Benjamin Button is almost worth the price of admission in and of itself) the relentless assault of gently ironic sight gags helps reduce one of the great American short stories into a ""Garden State"" for middle-aged office drones - while not as manic as Zach Braffs divisive debut Stillers film is even more pleased with its own perspective its final moments realizing the true potential of its avatar-like protagonist as a means of arrogantly gifting the audience with their own specialness. For all of its scope and bombast ""Walter Mitty"" is just another story of an ordinary man learning to appreciate the world around him a metamorphosis that Stiller more believably and more enjoyably tackled in the modest 2004 rom-com ""Along Came Polly"". Palpably well-intentioned ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is nevertheless phony to the core - failing to articulate why its urgent that we escape from our fantasies the unintended takeaway from this soft spectacle is that we dont need to dream less we just need to dream better. SCORE 4.8 / 10 ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" will be released in theaters on Christmas Day.

On paper then the idea of Stiller directing and starring in a new adaptation of ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" the 1939 James Thurber short story previously turned into a 1947 feature starring Danny Kaye makes perfect sense The actor is a natural fit for the role of an everyman daydreamer lost in far-out heroic fantasies which present an opportunity for a contrast between normality and dramatic overstatement that Stiller theoretically has the filmmaking chops to explore. Unfortunately the actor-directors long-gestating ""Walter Mitty"" treatment less an adaptation than an original story that transports the character from Thurbers story into modern times shows none of the edgy storytelling looniness present in Stillers finest work. Instead every element seems calculated to service an easygoing commercial product that plays up the sentimentality of the scenario while rendering it inoffensively bland. Steve Conrads straightforward screenplay coupled with warm music cues Stuart Dryburghs romantic imagery and a basic triumph-of-the-little-guy plot give ""Walter Mitty"" the one-note capriciousness of a swooning Mac commercial. It all goes down light and easy but to what end? The irony of the movies emptiness stems from a lack of vision in a story exclusively about just that. In development stages for years this version of ""Walter Mitty"" has been tossed around various studios by producer Samuel Goldwyn Jr. (whose father produced the previous version) since the early nineties when hotshot directors ranging from Ron Howard to Steven Spielberg expressed interest. Passed through so many hands its underlying appeal has been steadily rubbed out Stillers take has no discernible personality much like Walter himself. In this version the character is an isolated Life magazine staffer who wastes his days developing negatives for the publications photographers an inadvertent metaphor (in a movie rife with overt ones) for the lack of clarity in its ideas. The story finds Walter tasked with tracking down the cover photo for the magazines last issue before it ceases print publication; in between imaginary sequences in which he impresses fellow Life staffer Cheryl (Kristen Wiig) with daring rescues and macho exclamations his more plausible quest involves a search for the nomadic photographer and adventurer Sean OConnell (Sean Penn in little more than a cameo role) in the hopes that he possesses the missing shot the magazine demands. That solitary plot device holds less appeal than Walters apparent psychological disconnect from the world around him though Stiller never does much creatively with the device. Walters conundrum is formulated early on during a phone call he makes to an amiable service rep from eHarmony.com the dating site where he initially tries to stalk Cheryl before realizes he needs to flesh out his profile. (The sites presence marks one of several gratuitous instances of product placement; its got nothing on the way Papa Johns figures into Walters melancholic backstory). ""I havent really done anything notable or noticeable"" Walter sighs then imagines himself making a superhero plunge into a burning building while a pleased Cheryl looks on. With the tension between Walters real life and his daydreams established even before the opening credits the movie settles into a basic rhythm that continues throughout the first act before illusions and reality merge with predictably saccharine results. Walters non-imaginary world doesnt hold much more credibility than his dreams. Wiig stuck in a basic role that calls for little more than routine line readings offers little depth to justify Walters obsession with her. Adam Scott as the comically bearded corporate overlord tasked with bearing down on Walter at every moment brings a broad silliness out of the sync with the everyday quality of his world. Shirley MacLaine as Walters supportive mother has only a few scenes to bring a more refined ebullience to the story but its pretty much beside the point This has always been Walters tale so at least Stillers subdued performance manages to make the characters alienated state into a kind of connective tissue that carries the story from scene to scene. However having outlined the details of Walters drab existence and the sunny delusions he uses to escape it ""Walter Mitty"" goes from being unremarkable to contradictory It allows its protagonist to embark on an adventure as incredulous as his daydreams with the character launching on abrupt trips to Greenland Iceland and eventually the wilds of ungoverned Afghanistan in an attempt to track the elusive OConnell down. Set to soul-searching tracks by Arcade Fire among other lively pop music cues the CGI-heavy visuals of Walters journey are at times quite impressive. One nifty shot of an airplane in motion intended to capture his first overseas trip in its entirety stands out for its swift depiction of the lengthy journey -- but for that same reason has the ostentatious feel of a music video sketch. The presence of such trickery in the ostensibly ""real"" part of the narrative render it utterly simplistic. ""Walter Mitty"" shows greater potential in its first scene a wittily minimalistic peek at Walters lonely apartment life. Theres a certain honesty to its candor thats invigorated by Stillers likably restrained screen presence and allows ""Walter Mitty"" to remain far more palatable than its blithely superficial narrative allows for. Thats not an excuse for a lack of engagement but its safe to say there are plenty of good-natured pathos and visual polish to distract from the movies failings. Individual moments have been calculated to foreground the emotional nature of the material most notably when Walter imagines Cheryl singing a gentle rendition of ""Space Oddity"" to him in Greenland and providing him with a last-second motivation to kick his adventure into high gear. Yet even as the sequence manages to obtain an inspiring kick it also suffers the fate of an obvious device used too gratuitously marking the beginning of a downward spiral. By its end the movie is lost in a Walter Mitty fantasy of its own. Criticwire grade C HOW WILL IT PLAY? 20th Century Fox releases ""Walter Mitty"" on December 25 when its family-friend qualities star appeal and timing should help perform solidly at the box office especially now that it has received some initial exposure at the New York Film Festival; its awards potential is a tougher sell though it could manage some traction as the upbeat alternative to an otherwise fairly grim season.

Reply teddy crescendo May 12 2016 113 pm Ben Stiller stinks to high heaven (and so do all of his films). Reply Adey J May 12 2016 113 pm I wonder how anybody can sit through more than 20 seconds of Ben Stiller.

No surprises here. Reply Alan B May 12 2016 113 pm Eric Kohn Says I like Stiller but only when Still doesnt try to do something new. I want him to stay in the little box I have made for him and - if he doesnt - then hes a sentimental sell-out that incorporates a dating service in his film that people actually use in real life.
