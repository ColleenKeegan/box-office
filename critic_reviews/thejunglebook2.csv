When the Oscar-nominated tune ""Bare Necessities"" from the original 1967 ""The Jungle Book"" is reprised three times during the 72 minutes of this belated follow-up the thought of padding springs all too readily to mind. This visually appealing but narratively undernourished seventh feature release from Disney Television Animations DisneyToon Studios follows the likes of ""Return to Never Land"" ""The Tigger Movie"" and ""Recess Schools Out"" in having the feel of a direct-to-video title thats been upgraded to theatrical status in the hopes of wringing a few extra bucks out of it and improving its not-too-distant homevid marketability. As before the ploy should work again. Pic opened Friday in France and Scandinavia a week ahead of domestic release. Original ""Jungle Book"" based on Rudyard Kiplings ""Mowgli"" stories was the last feature personally supervised by Walt Disney before his death. Sequel picks up where the previous pic ended with wolf-reared boy Mowgli (energetically voiced by Haley Joel Osment) having entered into regimented village life but remaining nostalgic for his carefree days with bear-pal Baloo (John Goodman) in the wilds. As his adoptive father observes ""You can take the boy out of the jungle but you cant take the jungle out of the boy."" After Mowgli flaunts the rules by venturing back into the forest his comely quasi-girlfriend Shanti (Mae Whitman) follows him as do her antic little brother parents and it eventually seems the entire village. In addition to Baloo who jealously covets Mowglis attention in the face of competition from Shanti other animal characters from the original resurface including a protective panther a Col. Blimpish elephant and family a comically threatening snake some vultures and monkeys and most significantly a predatory tiger Shere Khan (made to sound like ""The Lion Kings"" Scar reincarnate by thesp Tony Jay). The G rating notwithstanding some quick cuts of beasts jumping into view will prove startling to small-fry. For their adult chaperones there are pleasures to be found in the vibrant color schemes of the backgrounds. Animation which combines traditional and computerized work is agreeable although the different visual planes utilized to produce a sense of three dimensions creates the look of a pop-up book at times. Execution outdoes the material More development and nuance in Karl Geurs script would have made a big difference. The two new songs the jazz-oriented ""Jungle Rhythm"" and ""W-I-L-D"" are perfunctory. No credit goes to Kipling or the 1967 screenwriters per se although a tag notes that ""This film would not have been possible without the inspiration from the original motion picture and the work of its talented artists and animators.""

"Nothing New in Jungle Book 2 washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Nothing New in Jungle Book 2 Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 14 2003 RELATIVELY INNOCUOUS but utterly unnecessary -- except from the standpoint of unbridled capitalism -- ""The Jungle Book 2"" feels like ""The Jungle Book"" minus something crucial an aesthetic raison detre. ""But Ive already seeen that moo-bie"" my 3-year-old videophile son whined every day for a week prior to my dragging him to a Saturday morning press screening of the sequel to the Kipling-based animated Disney classic. ""No. You havent"" I insisted. ""That was Jungle Book 1. This is brand-new and completely different."" Turns out he was right. Picking up where the original left off with wild-child Mowgli (voice of Haley Joel Osment) struggling to adjust to civilized life in a jungle village ""JB2"" wastes no time abandoning that promising story line throwing the diaper-clad monkey-boy back into the forest as soon as it possibly can so our hero can pal around with old buddies Baloo the bear (John Goodman) and Bagheera the panther (Bob Joles) -- just as he did in 1967. Oh and lets not forget the evil Shere Khan the tiger (Tony Jay) who is understandably angry at having been set on fire in the first flick. Disney knows which side its bread is buttered on and so it trots out reprises of the popular songs ""Colonel Hathis March"" (aka ""The Elephant Song"") and ""The Bare Necessities."" Sure it pads things out with a couple of forgettable new tunes by Paul Grabowsky and Lorraine Feather and a couple of fresh characters Mae Whitman and Connor Funk as tiger bait -- I mean village children -- Shanti and Ranjan. But otherwise it is a formulaic retread. ""The Jungle Book"" is by any measure a great movie and theres undeniable pleasure in seeing old friends again. But the franchise is cheapened by Disneys crass commercialism in releasing material that by rights should have gone straight to video. THE JUNGLE BOOK 2 (G 72 minutes) -- Contains a scary tiger.

Unfortunately it relies on those two elements to keep our interest providing a paper-thin story. Mowgli who was raised by wild animals in Rudyard Kiplings tale is back with bear buddy Baloo in The Jungle Book 2. Mowgli the jungle boy raised by wild animals in Rudyard Kiplings tale is endearingly voiced by Haley Joel Osment. His laid-back bear buddy Baloo is given just the right touch by John Goodman (though its hard to forget Phil Harris Beat version). The voice of the evil tiger Shere Khan belongs to Tony Jay who sounds as if hes doing an impersonation of Jeremy Irons Scar from The Lion King. Review of the movie The Jungle Book 2 ( out of four) Stars Haley Joel Osment John Goodman Tony Jay Director Steve Trenbirth Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating G Opens Friday nationwide The 1967 original had one of the best scores of any Disney animated movie. The sequels makers must have thought so too The Bare Necessities is heard three times during the films 72 minutes. There are a couple of new tunes that are pleasant enough (particularly the rousing Jungle Rhythm) but they arent as memorable as the original songs. Smash Mouth does a rocking rendition of another song from the original I Wanna Be Like You. The new film picks up where the first left off. Shanti (Mae Whitman) the girl whom Mowgli sees at the end of the first movie has lured the man-cub to her village where he has been adopted. But he left some of his heart behind in the jungle. He misses Baloo and has a hankering to climb trees and swing from vines. But he also has a hankering for Shanti the cutie who has become his friend. Fed up with the rules of civilization Mowgli finds himself back in the jungle as leader of the pack. But hes torn between the ease of his former simple life and love for his new family. Theres much bungling in the jungle particularly when Shanti and Mowglis little stepbrother Ranjan attempt to track down the man-cub. New to the picture is Phil Collins as Lucky a vulture that sounds as if he just swooped in from Liverpool. Much like last years Return to Neverland Jungle Book 2 feels like Disneys pale re-working of an original. A cynic might posit that its sole reason for being is to milk a few more dollars from nostalgic baby boomers and their offspring. The animation is lovely but the simplistic story feels as if it were arrived at by committee after an hour-long meeting. Disney keeps hoping for another hit like The Tigger Movie which opened two years ago. And the studio is hedging its bets If Mowgli doesnt send moviegoers stampeding to multiplexes theres always Piglet whose movie opens next month.

FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 1 Back to Gallery JUNGLE BOOK 2 Animated musical. Voices by John Goodman Haley Joel Osment and Phil Collins. Directed by Steve Trenbirth. Written by Karl Geurs. (Rated G. 90 minutes. At AMC Van Ness Metreon Century 20 Daly City and Century Plaza 10.) This should be called ""Jungle Book Too."" It is the same movie as the 1967 smash hit right down to ""The Bare Necessities."" Hearing that song again can only make you think of two things Shouldnt it be called ""The Bear Necessities"" since Baloo the bear sings it and was 1967 really such a fallow year musically that this modest little ditty was nominated for an Oscar? If you loved the original rent it then run it backward because thats what they do here. In 1967 the jungle boy Mowgli (here Haley Joel Osment of ""The Sixth Sense"") was in the wild and is enticed into the village. Here hes in the village and is lured into the jungle. Complications ensue. After all these years Mowgli hasnt grown an inch. Or gotten a haircut. He capers around the huts making moony eyes at the lovely Shanti (Mae Whitman from ""Independence Day"") and wondering about these weird feelings that have him both attracted to her and yet pulled to go back to the jungle. Meanwhile deep in the bush Baloo (John Goodman of ""Monsters Inc."") is still singing and dancing although he mopes that it isnt the same without his little buddy. Frankly if anyone needs a girlfriend it is Baloo but thats a different movie. Baloo and Mowgli get back together the evil tiger Shere Khan threatens everyone and musical numbers break out at the drop of a mango -- just like the first version. There is really only one surprising moment. Singer Phil Collins appears as the voice of ""Lucky"" the vulture. Youd never guess it was him. Of course the roly-poly Goodman with the gravely voice of Wolfman Jack channeling John Wayne was born to play Baloo. But couldnt he get some funny lines? In fact theres hardly a laugh in the whole show. It is also a dubious choice to stick with the idea of the jungle gang as jazz hepcats as in the first ""Book."" The musical soundtrack is right out of Cab Calloway including characters shouting ""Crazy man crazy"" or ""You dig?"" Todays preteens may wonder what all the digging is about. If anything this is a kind of period piece for cartoon aficionados. The animation is mostly retro lovingly hand-rendered backdrops and scenes but the sad fact is they look a little drab compared with todays splashy computer graphics. Computer imaging was used for the big production number ""W-I-L-D"" but lets just say if that song is nominated for an Oscar we are in a musical drought of Sahara-like proportions. The best tune in the whole 90 minutes comes from the band Smash Mouth over the closing credits. It would be a nod to today except that Smash Mouth a Disney favorite is so totally five minutes ago. And two the song they do ""Wanna Be Like You"" is from the original movie. The overall result of this remake is something as safe and dull as oatmeal. Now that todays kids have seen SpongeBob SquarePants are they really going to be entranced by a dancing blue bear? -- C.W. Nevius QUAI DES ORFEVRES Film noir. Starring Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier. Directed by Henri- Georges Clouzot. (Not rated. 102 minutes. At the Castro.) . ""Quai des Orfevres"" (1947) is an excellent film noir from Henri-Georges Clouzot the French director best known for ""The Wages of Fear"" (1952) and ""Diabolique"" (1955). ""Quai"" shares with those masterpieces a sophisticated understanding of human psychology and if anything has an even greater sense of atmosphere. Viewers acquainted with American film noir will be struck immediately by the contrasts on display here. While American noirs ache with the spiritual desolation of World War II and fear of the Atomic Age in ""Quai des Orfevres"" the war is not a spiritual problem but an almost tangible presence. As viewers were invited to look at streets that three years earlier had been under German authority. We can feel the history of that trauma in the demeanor of the characters who are loose and carefree and yet worn out and melancholy. Citizens who have just gotten over five years of terror are not going to worry much about enforcing morality; thus the adult nature of this 1947 noir has no American equivalent. We first meet our flighty heroine Jenny (Suzy Delair) as she entertains a music hall audience with a jolly song that seems to be about her genitalia. Her best friend (Simone Renant) is a lesbian and her husband (Bernard Blier the father of director Bertrand Blier) is a long- suffering musician who puts up with his wifes flirtations. The film -- whose title (literally ""embankment of the goldsmiths"") is the Parisian equivalent of Scotland Yard -- revolves around an investigation into the death of a sleazy producer. Jenny her husband and her best friend all have things to hide about the night in question and though their alibis seem tight a police detective (Louis Jouvet) is getting closer to the truth with every question. Along the way we get more than a glimpse of two shadowy worlds -- the music hall and the police investigation unit -- which are both presented as run-down and crawling with misfits. But in this case the treatment is ultimately forgiving. . This film contains adult ribald humor. -- Mick LaSalle Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 8 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 9 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...
