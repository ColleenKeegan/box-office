ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Punisher War Zone 1/2 out of four Stars Ray Stevenson Dominic West Colin Salmon Doug Hutchison Wayne Knight Dash MihokDirector Lexi AlexanderRating R for pervasive strong brutal violence language and some drug useRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Before becoming a blood-thirsty vigilante bent on murdering gangsters of all stripes the Punisher studied to be a priest. You have to give the guy credit for a unique career trajectory from seminarian to slasher. He was Frank Castle back then and the movie doesnt explain why he left the priesthood but maybe it had something to do with that pesky ""Thou shalt not kill"" commandment. In between the seminary and killing rampages he was a Marine and had a wife and child. Deep within his tortured psyche the self-styled avenging angel might still feel the stirrings of faith. Before going off to slay bad guys and rescue a mother and child in peril he visits a church and chats up a priest offering his version of a confession ""Somebody has to punish the corrupt."" Ray Stevenson plays the punitive fellow. In Punisher War Zone hes an ordinary guy not a superhero though he is a sure shot and ruggedly handsome. Besides flesh-and-blood nemeses he wrestles psychic demons. In his bloodlust to slay Mafia types he accidentally kills a law enforcement officer. He must protect the mans widow and young daughter and fend off Jigsaw (Dominic West) and Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison) and the army theyve assembled to punish him. Faces are blown off. Bodily fluids mix with gallons of gushing spewing blood. The dialogue is beyond cliched and performances feel cobbled together from other movies. Characters speak in banalities ""Lets do this"" is repeated. Then theres the evocative growling ""Stay out of my way"" and ""You boys play nice."" The best is a reference to a malevolent immigrant as ""an Old Country genocidal maniac."" What may matter most to those who consider this as entertainment is the grisly violence. A chair leg impales an eye kidneys are yanked from a living body a bad guy is thrown into a glass-recycling machine. At one point the Punisher is asked who punishes him. The better question for those who made this inane bloodfest is Why punish us? Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Ray Stevenson as Frank Castle in ""Punisher War Zone."" Photo Lionsgate Movie review Punisher War Zone bloody good 1 / 1 Back to Gallery PunisherWar Zone Action. Starring Ray Stevenson Dominic West Doug Hutchison and Julie Benz. Directed by Lexi Alexander. (Rated R. 103 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Every few months my father calls me out of the blue informs me that hes at a video store and asks what he should rent. What he really means is ""Your mother is working tonight so what should I watch thats fun and violent and wont require a lot of brain cells?"" ""The Substitute"" was a winner. So was ""Under Siege"" and ""Under Siege 2 Dark Territory."" Patrick Swayzes ""Road House"" is the ""Citizen Kane"" of this genre. Definitely add ""Punisher War Zone"" to the queue. Assuming you can appreciate the high level of gore and assorted sadistic weirdness the action is satisfying and the dark story is close to the tone of its Marvel Comics source material. Most important its a movie made by a filmmaker who knows both her audience and her limitations. Budget constraints and other factors ensured that director Lexi Alexander was going to make a B movie so she embraces its B-movie qualities and crafts a memorable piece of entertainment. This is the third and by far the best ""Punisher"" movie which all focus on Frank Castle an ex-soldier who turns ruthless vigilante after his family is executed by mobsters. In the new film Castle (Ray Stevenson) accidentally shoots an undercover FBI agent during a revenge killing spree. This results in a crisis of conscience a few kidnappings by the bad guys and lots of blood getting splattered across New York City. The past two ""Punisher"" movies - starring Dolph Lundgren and Thomas Jane - spent too much time with the setup. Alexander wisely crams Castles origin story into about 14 seconds of exposition and gets on with the carnage. From there this is truth in advertising at its best. People get punished. In a war zone. The only way to make the title more accurate would have been to call it ""Punisher War Zone Massive Head Wounds."" Exploding craniums seem to be the specialty of Alexander a German-born director who is also a champion kickboxer. None of the above is sarcasm by the way. Its so easy to screw up this kind of movie - a director must instinctively know when to hold back and when the acting and action should be completely over the top. Mostly Alexander chooses over the top. If one character in ""Punisher War Zone"" had a fake-sounding New Yorker voice or exaggerated Irish brogue it would have been a distraction. But everyone in this movie speaks in a really bad accent and then it becomes part of the fun. It seems as if hundreds of bad guys die and its a tribute to the creativity involved that no two are blown away in the same manner. Which brings us to the primary villains Jigsaw (Dominic West) and Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison). The writing in ""Punisher"" doesnt approach the greatness of ""The Wire"" so West goes the other way and plays the character as a cartoonish farce. Hutchison balances this well by giving us a Joker homage smashing lots of things with his head and pulling peoples kidneys out with his bare hands. In many ways ""Punisher War Zone"" is Batman for Dummies. Or better yet Batman for Directors Who Dont Have Christian Bale or a 200 Million Budget. ""Punisher War Zone"" isnt perfect even by B-movie standards. Beyond Jigsaw and Loony Bin Jim the bad guys have all the menace of those ""Home Alone"" burglars. Some of the dialogue is both cryptic and ridiculous. (""Ill see you in hell"" a friend who is about to die tells Castle. His response ""If I see you in hell Ill kick your a- out."") And when Castle visits a gunsmith played by Wayne Knight to buy some weapons at least one person in your audience is bound to ruin the moment by shouting ""Newman"" But the positives far outweigh the negatives in this film. Alexander is helped by veteran martial arts choreographer Pat E. Johnson who has an old-school approach that doesnt involve obscuring the action with quick edits. (Bonus Pat E. Johnson trivia He played the referee in ""The Karate Kid."") Meanwhile Stevenson has only two expressions - brooding and sad and brooding and angry. Really its one more than he needs. -- Advisory This film contains strong language drug use and brutal violence and gore including a character who fixes his broken nose with a pencil - which is the second-coolest thing a bad guy has done with a Faber-Castell No. 2 in the movies this year (Confused? Ask a friend whos seen ""The Dark Knight"").

"Punisher War Zone | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; punisher-war-zone ) Punisher War Zone (United States/Canada 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Marvel Comics must really like The Punisher. This is their third attempt to bring him to the big screen. Theres a saying that ""the third times a charm"" but it doesnt apply here. More appropriate is this baseball-related statement ""Three strikes and youre out."" Chiefly because of the slick production values and shorter running time Punisher War Zone is an improvement over 2004s The Punisher (with Thomas Jane in the title role) but not to an extent that most people will notice. Its considerably better than the earlier Dolph Lundgren version but the less said about that the better. Punisher War Zone is bad enough that it may remind viewers how lucky we have been this year to get two superior superhero movies in Iron Man and The Dark Knight. This is essentially a Steven Seagal movie without the Ponytailed One and may appeal to those who enjoyed Seagals rather bland cookie-cutter action films. Its a combination of ultra-violent fight scenes dull exposition and a hero who prefers grunting to lengthy discourse. The director is Lexi Alexander and Ill give her credit in two areas. First she doesnt skimp on the blood and shows no fear of a high death toll. This is not a film where the bad guys get knocked out or arrested. They are frequently decapitated blown to bits and eviscerated. No attempt was made to water down this R-rated content to a more teenage-friendly PG-13. With compromises it could have been done but thankfully someone with balls made the decision to force the kids to sneak in (which they no doubt will). So if bloody mayhem is your kind of thing Punisher War Zone offers it with glee. Secondly the action sequences are competently filmed and presented. No shaky camera. No fast editing. Its refreshing to be able to watch a fight and know at any given moment whats going on. Unfortunately most of the fights arent of the sort where coherence matters or where the result is in doubt. The story is a stock vigilante tale. The Punisher Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson) makes a mistake while clearing out a mansion full of mobsters - he kills an undercover Federal agent. Guilt-ridden as a result of this mistake he vows to protect the mans widow (Julie Benz) and daughter. They need his protection because a couple of bad guys named Jigsaw (Dominic West) and Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison) are after them. It all has to do with some missing money and personal vendettas. Meanwhile the Feds are trailing the Punisher. One of their most competent guys and the dead Feds ex-partner Paul Budiansky (Colin Salmon) is on the job but hes encountering resistance from the NYPD who revere Frank enough to protect him. Ray Stevenson becomes the third actor to essay the title role and hes got whats needed for the part a steely gaze a no-nonsense demeanor and absolutely zero sense of humor. Punisher War Zone is a dark motion picture - there arent even the obligatory one-liners to provide a little comedic relief. Stevenson may be best known as Titus Pulio from the defunct HBO series Rome. He showed some charisma in that role; it is not apparent here. Both Dominic West as the badly scarred Jigsaw and Doug Hutchison as the cannibalistic Loony Bin Jim have taken lessons from Jack Nicholsons interpretation of The Joker when they would have done better mimicking Heath Ledger. Theyre campy and over-the-top and as a result not in the least bit intimidating. Punisher War Zone can be said to unofficially end a pretty good string of comic book superhero movies from both D.C. and Marvel. This movie is a waste of time and talent and maybe it says something that theres not even a Stan Lee cameo. The film tries to humanize Frank by providing him with a burden of grief over the accidental shooting but this aspect of the plot never gels and has a tacked-on feel. It can be tough to add psychology into the mix in a vigilante film but it was successfully accomplished in The Brave One (with Jodie Foster); here the guilt feels like a way to excuse the violence. (As in yes theres a lot of carnage but at least the good guy has doubts about some of what hes doing.) Its not enough and it only makes Punisher War Zone more gloomy. This is a dark unpleasant movie that serves best to illustrate how masterfully the filmmakers of The Dark Knight crafted a tale that at its core has a share of similar themes.

Oops sorry. This film gets you thinking in hardboiled cliches.But our lethal hero is just warming up. He kills so many people so quickly you begin to worry that the film is only going to last 10 minutes. Even if there were an infinite number of bad guys in what is supposed to be New York City they would be an endangered species before the Punisher even broke a sweat.The previous adaptation of this comic book series starring Thomas Jane was a restrained relatively realistic exercise. It was a near cousin of Charles Bronsons Death Wish franchise.In this sequel violence is its own reward. The carnage is so graphic and relentless the film has all the charm of a pit bull fight.The plot is rather superfluous but lets give it a go shall we?Frank Castle is an average guy a former seminarian and Marine. When his J.Crew family is senselessly slaughtered he becomes the Punisher a killing machine chewing up the criminals the legal system is too pusillanimous or too corrupt to bring to justice.He storms around the city dressed all in black looking like a furious Steven Seagal. His arms dealer a gig as lucrative as being Tammy Faye Bakkers makeup supplier is played by Wayne Knight (Seinfelds nemesis Newman).For the Punisher the one that got away is Jigsaw (Dominic West of The Wire) a crime boss with so many raised stitches on his face he looks like a baseball. His mug is so grotesque that a cold-blooded killer projectile vomits upon first seeing him.Then the Punisher accidentally mows down an undercover FBI agent. Can you blame him? Expecting the Punisher to slow down long enough to consider whom he is slaying is like asking a speed reader to savor a period.He is so filled with regret over his slipup that he actually considers laying down his scythe. However he is being chased around by the dead mans vengeful partner (Colin Salmon) and Jigsaws lunatic brother (Doug Hutchinson) who cackles like Woody Woodpecker as he reduces the world to rubble.Punisher War Zone is so intent on its no-mercy killings that it misses some obvious implausibilities. Everyone in the film drives around in Range Rovers even the cops. A New York gangster talks with a heavy Boston accent. And a dreadlocked henchman seemingly cant decide if hes Jamaican or Irish.The acting is better than the script deserves and Lexi Alexanders cut-to-the-hearse direction lends the film considerable kick. But there is a steel spike at the end of Punishers boot that will gouge your eyes out. Punisher War Zone 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Lexi Alexander.

When Frank Castle prowls for revenge after mobsters wipe out his family a punch to the face results in a cave-in that suggests a hammer meeting a watermelon. A gunshot leaves half a head neatly chopped off as though with a cleaver. Sudden impalings are also a big favorite. Returning in a sequel to a 2004 movie that was not crying out for one Castle a k a the Punisher (Ray Stevenson) has no superpowers - unless you count an ability to be dull. Each minute of this movie passed like a week on jury duty. Castle is after Jigsaw played by Dominc West. He played Jimmy McNulty on ""The Wire"" and has thus been busted down from one of the best TV shows ever to an action spectacular seemingly designed to fill in late night slots on German cable TV. This miscreant is a Mafioso with a comical accent who survives being dropped in a glass compactor but sustains a Leatherface-style makeover as a result. Jigsaw had to go to a free clinic to get it stitched together because ""Insurance said I missed a payment."" After he suffers the loss of a team of henchmen led by an Irish Rastafarian gymnast (no it doesnt make sense in the movie either) who is doing somersaults over the rooftops when the Punisher extinguishes him with a shoulder-fired missile Jigsaw hooks up with his demented cannibal brother. To him in a moment of weakness Jigsaw tearfully confesses ""Just when I think Im OK I see my reflection somewhere . . . I look horrible"" The movie keeps using shots of the Empire State Building to try to convince us it has something to do with New York albeit one in which an el train runs over 23rd Street the A train stops at a station identified as ""5th Avenue and 13th Street"" people live in cozy single-family houses with leafy front lawns and a place called ""the Brad Street Hotel"" hosts a convocation of baddies dedicated to wiping out the Punisher. Down in a subway tunnel the Punisher maintains a curious lair stocked with musical instruments a tea kettle and a wing chair. Occasionally he talks strategy with a doomed glasses-wearing fellow named Microchip played by the guy who played Newman on ""Seinfeld"" or suggests a higher purpose to his vigilante creed when he says ""Sometimes Id like to get my hands on God."" With its dopey fight scenes grimy look and goopy gore this movie is so far from ept that inept is the wrong word. Its anti-ept. kyle.smithnypost.com PUNISHER WAR ZONE Explosively bad. Running time 107 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity drug abuse). At the E-Walk the Kips Bay the 84th Street others.

Comments Punisher War Zone The Punisher (2004) which brought the Marvel Comics vigilante to the big screen made some feints toward respectability with its name cast (John Travolta Roy Scheider) and ostensibly tragic setup (in which the heros wife and children are killed by the Mafia). This awful sequel dispenses with any such pretense its cartoonish characters running an endless gauntlet of hypergruesome violence. The stars are a couple of familiar faces from HBO Ray Stevenson (Rome) replaces Thomas Jane as the Punisher and Dominic West (The Wire) is the villain who falls into a glass crusher and winds up with a face like an old baseball.

Starring Ray Stevenson Dominic West Director Lexi Alexander Running time 147  Editorial Review Its hard to say exactly when my resistance broke down while watching ""Punisher War Zone"" the almost entirely joyless sequel to the 2004 film adaptation of the Marvel Comics series about tortured vigilante Frank Castle (Ray Stevenson replacing an apparently shamefaced Tom Jane). Could it have been when Frank who goes by the more superheroic moniker the Punisher shoves a pencil several inches up his own nostril to loudly wrench a piece of cartilage back into alignment after suffering a broken nose while meting out one of his trademark bloodbaths? No that happens way too early. How about when one of the villains (Dominic West) is thrown into a machine that grinds recycled glass? Nah too predictable. Frank should have known that it would only turn the bad guy into a badly scarred master criminal bent on revenge and with an even cooler nickname Jigsaw than his own. Maybe it was the scene of human cannibalism courtesy of Jigsaws brother Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison). Or maybe the broken wineglass shoved through the trachea of a Russian mobster. Or one of various impalings. Oh I know It was the second close-up of grievous head trauma resulting from high-caliber-bullet wounds. After that I was a giggling idiot laughing like a psychopath at every arterial spurt. Now I realize that for some the above (partial) list will serve only as an advertisement for the movies sanguinary charms. But anyone with a modicum of good sense -- or a weak stomach -- will take it as a warning to stay the heck away from this literally and figuratively deadly ""War Zone."" -- Michael OSullivan (Dec. 5 2008) Contains drug abuse liberal profanity and a punishing level of violence.

"Rome star eager for punishing role - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Rome star eager for punishing roleDecember 05 2008|By The Fresno BeeFirst there was Dolph Lundgren. Then came Thomas Jane. Now it is Ray Stevensons turn.Over nearly a two-decade span the three actors have played the Marvel Comics character the Punisher in feature films. Stevensons turn at the role ""Punisher War Zone"" opens Friday.The Punisher is vigilante/hero Frank Castle. He has no super powers -- unless you count being able to kick the butts of bad guys without breaking a sweat. In ""War Zone"" the Punisher faces Jigsaw a mob boss who has put together an army of bad guys.While the Punisher is a killing machine both Lundgren and Jane played the character with a sympathetic side. Stevenson would have none of that.""I was not aware of the comic book when interest came through for me to do the role"" Stevenson said.Stevenson went out and bought a few copies of the comics. He found the stories to be ultraviolent. He also liked the writing because no punches were pulled when it came to the Punishers obsession with revenge and his take on a variety of social issues.Thats the kind of movie he wanted to make.""I dont want people to leave the theater wanting to be Frank Castle. I want them to be glad he is there. But I dont want anyone to want to be him"" Stevenson said.Stevenson who stands 6 feet 4 inches is no stranger to playing larger-than-life characters. The Irish actor portrayed Dagonet the knight who sacrifices his life to save others in ""King Arthur."" Hes probably best known to American audiences for his portrayal of Titus Pullo in the HBO series ""Rome.""Although Pullo and the Punisher exist centuries apart Stevenson found the roles to be similar.""Titus taught me to live in the moment. This is where the gods have put him"" Stevenson said. ""Frank also lives for today. He doesnt plan. He has his own demands.""

Alas Stevenson doesnt have much to do except look gloomy after accidentally killing an FBI agent -- and then deliberately kills about 50 more people.

Gore-drenched actioner is guaranteed to draw fans of wretched excess like moths to a nuclear holocaust. Frank Castle aka the Punisher was last seen in 2004 unleashing his inner homicidal maniac on the mobsters who killed his wife and children. In the latest installment ""Punisher War Zone"" Frank is played by Ray Stevenson taking over for the originals Thomas Jane but he remains divinely ticked off ""Sometime Id like to get my hands on God"" he mutters still unafraid to take matters to the top. Gore-drenched actioner is guaranteed to draw fans of wretched excess like moths to a nuclear holocaust. Based on the Marvel Comics hero the Punisher is an ex-Marine whos virtually indestructible until the fight choreography says hes not. And then anyone can take a whack at the big guy even the psychopathic Loony Bin Jim (Doug Hutchison) whose gangster brother Billy Russoti (Dominic West) is turned into Jigsaw a kind of faux Joker with a face stitched like a baseball (all thanks to the Punisher seen early on feeding Billy through a glass-recycling machine). Billys line delivery sounds like The Sopranos "" Steven Van Zandt doing an impersonation of Robert Davi doing an impersonation of comedian Pat Cooper. Together these brothers do less for the image of Italian-Americans than Chef Boyardee a can of which seems to be exploding every three minutes. Along with torrents of gore ""Punisher War Zone"" (scripted by Nick Santora Art Marcum and Matt Holloway all new to the franchise) has moments that are deliriously funny because the violence is so awful and so casual Frank is just as apt to blow someones face off his neck as he is to grumble darkly. His weapons collection is vast well-oiled and large in caliber; his list of worthy corpses unending. Most of the time helmer Lexi Alexander (""Green Street Hooligans"") replacing the first pics Jonathan Hensleigh plays to ""Punishers"" fanboy base but often enough she lets slip that shes in on the gag. A body is impaled on a spiked fence. OK good. Then Frank uses the guys face as a step ladder. Even better. Stevenson (""Rome) plays Frank with appropriate solemnity and just an inkling of introspection; too much of course and the whole executioner ethos comes tumbling down which it does when Frank inadvertently kills an undercover FBI agent. This sets up the storys faux-humanist slant as Frank tries to protect the agents widow Angela (Julie Benz) and daughter Grace (Stephanie Janusauskas) from Jigsaw and Co. (When Grace puts her hand in Franks and says ""Dont go"" laughter is guaranteed.) Among the other less-than-believable aspects of Franks life is his spacious underground lair -- which had this really been shot in New York instead of Vancouver and Montreal would have been long ago rooted out by real estate developers and turned into condos. Also that no one can find him except when someone tries -- like federal agent Paul Budiansky (Colin Salmon) who at one point simply walks up to Frank and places him under arrest. Not that pic really needs it but light comic relief is provided by NYPD behavioral psychologist Martin Soap (Dash Mihok) who plays Jimmy Olsen to the Punishers Superman and the Punishers arms dealer (Wayne Knight ""Seinfeld""). Production values are adequate although the establishing shots of Manhattan from which Punisher then enters some Canadian subway system can be disconcerting. So is the pics glossy reflective flaring look which may just be out to distract auds from the horrible goings-on.

"Movie review Punisher War Zone -- 1 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Punisher War Zone -- 1 out of 5 stars Waging war on organized crime vigilante-hero Frank Castle sets his sights on mob boss Billy Russoti. After Russoti is left horribly disfigured by Castle he sets out for vengeance under his new alias Jigsaw. With the ""Punisher Task Force"" hot on his trail Castle must stand up to Jigsaws army before more of his evil deeds go unpunished. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic With Punisher War Zone Thomas Jane the actor with two first names and little acting talent looks like the smartest guy in the room. He didnt return to the vigilante film series after making one awful movie four years ago.To re-boot the DOA Punisher comic-book-to-film franchise Marvel went out and found the only actor on Earth to make Jane look charismatic. Ray Stevenson the new Punisher an ex-Special Forces instructor who slaughters bad guys to avenge the murder of his family is Irish and isnt allowed to speak a word for the first 30 minutes of War Zone. That speaks volumes. This Punisher stabs blows heads off impales and shoots maybe 244 or so villain-victims. Judge jury and executioner with extreme prejudice he locks and loads and locks and loads again. He tosses a bad guy into a glass recycling machine. Love that squishy slice-and-dice sound effect? Get used to it. Bodily fluids and the sounds they generate are a big part of this gory and wholly unsatisfying slasher film.Six years have passed and Punisher Frank Castles been killing and killing and yet New Yorks supply of villains and bodily fluids hasnt run dry. The villains are easy to find. They all wear black. Black on black. Asian Italian Russian or African-American everybody gets their duds from the same store. Frank falls afoul of an F.B.I. undercover operation kills an agent and is hunted by a fellow Fed (Colin Salmon) even as he tries to protect the dead agents widow and little girl and assassinate all the ""real"" bad guys.The bloodbath in the opening reel left Billy the Generic Italian Mobster sliced up so badly hes given himself a nickname -- ""Jigsaw."" Yeah its taken but he was sure Saw IV would be the last one too. Dominic West of 300 does serious career damage as Jigsaw slinging the worst ""badda bing-badda boom"" Jersey- Mafia accent this side of Hugh Grant. Mercifully his face is unrecognizable in the latter scenes of this badda-bomb.The Punisher encases himself in armor and clambers through the subway on the way to each showdown. He swaps Bible verses with a priest.""God be with you Frank."" ""Sometimes Id like to get my hands on God"" Frank hisses back because thats what heroes hiss in really bad comic-book adaptations.The laugh-out-loud stuff may not be sheer ineptitude but I wouldnt stake my life on it. Uwe Boll the Orson Welles of Awful Movies at long last has a challenger. By coincidence War Zones Lexi Alexander is also German-born. But the martial artist/stunt choreographer who thought shed landed her big Hollywood break with this should have checked with the smartest guy in the room. If Thomas Jane knew better shouldnt she?

This is easily one of the most brutal mainstream films of the year. Ive seen movies about flesh-eating zombies that feature less guts and gore getting splashed about the screen. The movie is a sequel to the 2004 comic-book adaptation The Punisher though it features a different director writers and even a new actor in the lead role. Back then we got sturdy Thomas Jane; now it is mopey Ray Stevenson (HBOs Rome) who glowers a lot and speaks in a voice so deep that it occasionally rattles the theater seats. Stevenson is Frank Castle whose family was murdered by mobsters. Now hes the Punisher a black-clad vigilante who does away with mob families in spectacularly violent fashion. Dominic West (TVs The Wire) is Russoti a baddie who winds up disfigured by Castle. After a botched plastic surgery job Russoti insists on being called ""Jigsaw"" and seeks to take down the Punisher. Too bad he didnt go after his dialect coach because the British actor does an excruciating bada-bing Italian accent. Director Lexi Alexander previously directed a rather intelligent drama about violence among soccer fans called Green Street Hooligans. She doesnt show any of her earlier restraint here; instead the movie noisily plows forward with no attempt at subtlety or characterization. Granted the take-no-prisoners style is occasionally effective. A sequence in which Jigsaw and his goons invade the home of a police widow and her young daughter has a nightmarish charge. The splatter crowd will also enjoy the scene as you get to see a mans face blown off at close range. For the most part however the movie is simply a lot of noise and energy that inspires no emotional impact although you may feel like you need to take a shower once the credits roll.
