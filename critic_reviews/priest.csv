(Scott Garfield/Screen Gems) By Mark Feeney Globe Staff / May 16 2011 E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Priest is based on a series of Korean graphic novels. What its really based on though is other movies -- a whole lot of other movies.An animated prologue summarizes a history in which Earth has been dominated by two groups humans and vampires. The vampires always held the upper hand or at least they did at night until a group of warrior priests came along to vanquish them. A large cross tattooed on the forehead serves the dual purpose of identifying the priests and making them look like skinheads.With the vampires now put in their place most humans live in dark teeming neon-lit cities (hey its ""Blade Runner). A few outcasts live in a post-apocalyptic landscape (hey its the Mad Max movies). A married couple and their daughter work a hardscrabble farm. The fathers named Owen and he has an absent brother whos . . . lets just say interesting (hey its the first ""Star Wars movie).The priests who have imprisoned the vampires on reservations (theyre like ""Shutter Island only without the ocean views) are now decommissioned. When vampires kidnap Owens daughter the local sheriff (dont even try to count how many westerns ""Priest is) comes into the city to get one of the priests to help him rescue her (all right one of the westerns is ""The Searchers).That priest played by Paul Bettany is Owens brother. Never cracking a smile Bettany looks like Ed Harris with finer facial features. Maybe hes making up for playing that evil monk in ""The Da Vinci Code. He climbs aboard his nitrogen-powered motorcycle to give chase (its all those American International biker pictures from the 60s). The sight of Bettany slicing across the desert has a kind of bozo grandeur as does ""Priest generally.As a lady priest Maggie Q shares a chaste unspoken love with a fellow priest (hey its ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon). Shes one of a quartet of clerical vampire hunters sent out to stop Bettany who has disobeyed church orders to go on his mission. Those orders come from Christopher Plummer who has a high old time doing everything but waggle his eyebrows as a sinister monsignor (hey its that TV movie where Plummer played Cardinal Law).The vampire-hunting priests wear black garments that look a lot more like dusters than cassocks (its ""The Matrix?) and they move in slow motion when they go into martial-arts mode which they frequently do (definitely ""The Matrix).The vampires it turns out travel on a special windowless train (hey its ""To the Finland Station -- oh wait thats not a movie). The train looks really cool. Three-D doesnt add much to the ""Priest viewing experience frankly but thats OK since even in 2-D its pretty interesting to look at. Having so many influences can do that for a movie.The train hurtles along at break-fang speed (hey its a Coors Light ad). Bettany and Cam Gigandet as the sheriff need to commandeer it (hey its ""The General). Do they succeed? Lets just say the movie ends with the figurative words ""To be continued all but filling the screen (hey its a series).Mark Feeney can be reached at mfeeneyglobe.com.

(Screen Gems)Sci-fi meets western in a graphic-novel adaptation gone wrong.By Tirdad Derakhshani Inquirer Staff WriterPosted May 14 2011Theres nothing quite like a hard-core horror pic about a vampire-hunting priest to get the blood pumping on date night.Priest is not that movie.A derivative mutt that haphazardly mixes half a dozen incompatible genres this 3D picture reteams director Scott Charles Stewart and star Paul Bettany who churned out the equally addled Legion in 2009.The two pictures are twins.Legion featured Bettany as a rebellious warrior-angel who descends to Earth on the eve of Armaggedon to save a woman from drooling icky-looking demons.In Priest the otherwise fine British actor plays a rebellious warrior-priest who descends into a dark underground hive to save a teenage girl from drooling icky-looking bloodsuckers.Priest which was adapted from the graphic novel by South Korean artist Min-Woo Hyung tries to evoke its comic roots with a lame and animated prologue. A voice-over chronicles the eons-long war between humans and vamps. See the humans were losing until the Church (Catholicism is not mentioned but implied) trained a cadre of knife-wielding taekwondo-using supermen from childhood.These priests whose foreheads sport a tattooed crucifix (why?) killed off all the marauding monsters.Peace is restored and a brave new - totalitarian - world is created by the Church. We see this bleak world in retro-futuristic cityscapes ripped off from Michael Andersons 1984 and Ridley Scotts Blade Runner.Billboards spell out the new creed ""Faith. Work. Security."" People are forced to pour out their hearts to the clergy in roadside video-phone confessional boxes that look alarmingly like port-o-potties.The film shifts from sci-fi-land to a western motif when a la John Fords The Searchers Bettanys niece Lucy (Lily Collins) is kidnapped by the head-honcho vampire an awfully witty cowboy (Stetson and all) played by Karl Urban.Bettany goes after Lucy with the help of a Priestess (an awfully sexy Maggie Q) and Lucys beau a sheriff played by Cam Gigandet who is duded out head to toe in cowboy gear. (No joke He wears chaps and a tin star.)Battles ensue.High production values and slick editing cant save this picture. Nor does its overbearing soundtrack music which tries to strong-arm viewers into believing theyre watching a pulse-pounding thriller.In reality Priest has no pulse at all.

It stars Paul Bettany as a priest who defies his religious superiors to prevent the slaughter of innocents. It is directed by Scott Stewart whose last film Legion was completely different. It starred Paul Bettany as an angel who defies God to prevent the slaughter of innocents. Stewart and Bettany are the Scorsese and DeNiro of mediocre CGI-laden supernatural thrillers. Bettany plays a priest named Priest. I guess he was so priest-y there was nothing else he could be called. In this world priests were once recruited based on their natural ability to fight vampires which was evidently the churchs main concern. But now the war between man and vampire is over (we won) and the remaining handful of vamps live on isolated reservations or in secret hives so priests are no longer needed. In fact even if a priest becomes aware of dangerous vampire activity he is not allowed to use his priestly powers to get involved. That is what happens to Priest. He lives in a big Orwellian city full of high-tech gadgetry and surveillance equipment while his brother sister-in-law and niece live out on the frontier. Priest gets word from the town sheriff Hicks (Cam Gigandet) that his kinfolk were ambushed and his niece Lucy (Lily Collins) abducted by a herd of vampires and their human slaves known as familiars. Priest wants to rescue her but his boss Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) says it is forbidden and should be left to the local civil authorities. ""To go against the church is to go against God"" the Monsignor declares eight or nine hundred times. Well guess what. PRIEST IS GONNA GO AGAINST GOD THEN AW HELLS YEAH Priest and his fellow priests have some enhanced physical powers including the ability to leap to great heights and to be good at throwing ninja stars. Hicks a regular dude has good aim with a six-shooter. Since hes in love with Lucy hes determined to bring her back alive even if shes been infected by the vampires. He and Priest stop every few minutes to have an argument over whether Priest will allow that or whether Priest will have to put her down. Theres a lot of stopping and arguing in this movie plus a lot of stopping and having somber spiritual chats and a lot of stopping and not doing anything. Basically for a movie about a rogue priest and his sheriff friend fighting the forces of evil Priest is exceptionally light on actual fighting. When it happens its cool slow-motion Matrix-y stuff creepy-looking vampires (theyre monsters not humanoids) engaging action. But its in short supply and the dialogue in between is generic the films mythology poorly explained. The film is based on Min-Woo Hyungs graphic novels -- based very very loosely on them from what I gather. Stewarts emphasis is style rather than substance (a common problem in this genre) and he certainly creates some striking images particularly in the sequences set in the stark wastelands. (The cinematographer Don Burgess gave a similar look to The Book of Eli.) Much about the story seems like it might have been interesting if it had been more fully explored the parallels to the Western genre the way society turned against the priests the peoples false sense of security in their big cities. Instead the story feels rushed as if artificially squeezed into an 87-minute time limit. Its too good-looking to be dismissed entirely not bad enough to be worthy of outright scorn but not good enough to watch either.

Credit Scott Garfield/Screen Gems Opened on Friday nationwide. Directed by Scott Stewart 1 hour 28 minutesNot far into ""Priest"" Scott Stewarts second consecutive film starring Paul Bettany as a John Wayne-like Christian avenger youll say to yourself ""Oh Its The Searchers and Vampires"" That realization will keep you amused for a few minutes but it becomes clear pretty quickly that the only real thought in the movie has gone into the cowboy-gothic costumes and the computer-generated effects.""Priest"" is what you get when you open a male geeks toy box and dump everything on the floor John Ford Sergio Leone comic books throwing stars computer-enhanced martial arts a runaway train schoolboy Roman Catholic rebellion and Maggie Q in skin-tight vestments.Mr. Bettany is the Ethan Edwards of the piece a clerical ninja living in a post-vampocalyptic world in which the humans cluster in dingy cities and the vampires are imprisoned in underground ""reservations."" When a band of renegade vamps kidnaps the priests niece he sets out with a young sidekick to find her vowing that he will kill her if shes been infected. (Yes the ""Searchers"" parallels are that literal.)The film based in name only on a series of South Korean graphic novels has nice washed-out desert exteriors and some cool jet-powered motorcycles but theres nothing in the hackneyed story or the derivative action scenes to make you take notice. (And the American Indian-vampire metaphor is too bizarre to bear much thought.) There are two things worth watching Mr. Bettany who makes an excellent latter-day Wayne and can put across nearly all of the aspiring-to-second-rate dialogue and Maggie Q who has a Jolie-like ability to project intelligence and emotion while looking scorching hot. ""Priest"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for violence.

"Priest review Forgive it Father for its a sin |       NJ.com comments Priest review Forgive it Father for its a sin Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 13 2011 at 620 PM updated May 13 2011 at 902 PM View/Post Comments Scott Garfield/Courtesy Screen Gems Paul Bettany left is a vampire-slayer in ""Priest."" ""Priest"" is a theological horror movie that leaves all sorts of questions in the audiences mind. For example Was poor Paul Bettany frightened by a monsignor at an early age? Is he trying to shave years off a stint in purgatory by all the willful suffering hes going through now? Is there any other way to explain his taste in roles? Because Bettany -- who was a murderous albino monk in ""The Da Vinci Code"" a sinful medieval priest in ""The Reckoning"" and no less than the Archangel Michael in ""Legion"" -- is now a futuristic vampire-hunting cleric in ""Priest"" And its an unholy mess. The film -- which did not screen for critics -- starts off well with a bit of old-school animation explaining how after centuries of human-vs.-bloodsucker war a new class of priests arose to exterminate the brutes. Once they succeeded the surviving vampires were packed off to camps. The priests were stripped of their power. And a fascist theocracy took control of what was left of the Earth. And so its been -- until one day a human/vampire leader leads the parasites in a new attack on humanity. Filmed in ugly grimy neutrals -- its as if the lifes been sucked out of the photography too -- its intricately confusing and casually offensive at once taking place in a world that cant decide what century its in. The cities are full of cheap ""Blade Runner""-style visuals where Christopher Plummer shouts from a video screen; the countryside is a dusty old Western full of patent medicine and pioneers. Not that any of it matters. Its all in one era and out the other once Bettany climbs aboard a high-tech motorcycle and goes out into the desert where a young relative has been kidnapped by a gang of savages who decided to leave the ""reservation."" The parallels to cowboy movies are both obvious -- Bettanys search is meant embarrassingly to evoke ""The Searchers"" -- and vaguely racist. Honestly if you do want to do a modern horror Western seeing saintly warriors as the cowboys and soulless monsters as the Indians is probably not the way you want to go. But that would assume that the filmmakers put some thought into this script (itself adopted from a Korean comic). And any script that has head-scratching lines such as ""With or without the clergy were still priests"" hasnt had any thought put into it at all. The creatures themselves -- which breed like insects and grow up to be eyeless slimy gargoyles -- are certainly a change from the usual fiends. Bettany meanwhile looks intense -- perhaps hes intently trying to remember when he was in movies such as ""A Beautiful Mind"" -- and Plummer looks like hes very pleased to have tricked you out of your money. The whole thing -- which in less than an hour-and-a-half manages to insult Catholics Native Americans John Wayne fans and anybody with two I.Q. points to spare -- all climaxes in a lot of fire and smoke and CGI explosions. Or does it? ""The war is over priest"" Plummer shouts. ""No its just beginning"" Bettany snaps back. Pray hes wrong. Ratings note The film contains violence. Priest (PG-13) Screen Gems (87 min.) Directed by Scott Charles Stewart. With Paul Bettany. Now playing in New Jersey.

"Priest Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review PriestVampires cowboys and priests make for a hodgepodge of a horror movie.May 14 2011|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times Paul Bettany left stars in ""Priest."" (Screen Gems / MCT )Vampires a so hot right now Also religion. And the apocalypse. And maybe cowboys? Pull together a hodgepodge of all these elements and one ends up with something like ""Priest"" the big-screen adaptation of a series of graphic novels directed by Scott Stewart. A long war between humans and oozy unsexy eyeless vampires ended with the humans victorious thanks to a league of battle-trained priests. The remaining vampires have been herded into remote prisons while humans live in walled-off cities rendering the warrior-priests unnecessary. When a city-dwelling former priest (Paul Bettany) learns that his country-dwelling brother (an underused Stephen Moyer from ""True Blood"") and his family have been attacked its time to dust off the jet-cycle and head into the desert to investigate. The priest discovers that peacetime has not been as peaceful as it might have seemed and has to head off an oncoming vampire invasion. The film is somehow a disappointing combo of too-full and oddly empty. Even with all the various parts and pieces going into its structure it feels bare-bones a the differentiation between the dystopian future-cities and the dust-bowl hinterlands never creates the tension it should and a fistful of crucifixes that become throwing stars is as deep as the theology gets. Stewart with a background in visual effects likes to place his characters as tiny specks in vast open vistas which may partly explain why the film remains disconcertingly remote. An animated prologue (designed by Genndy Tartakovsky in the style of Min-Woo Hyungs original art) gives a primer on the mythology and contains the films most engaging visuals. ""Priest"" is being projected (and priced) in 3-D venues; it was converted in post production. While watching in 3-D it is easy to forget that there are supposed to be some additional dimensional effects were it not for the glasses on your face and their dimming of on-screen color. The film also ends with a blatant set-up for a sequel that feels not only crass but also premature a one can only wish the filmmakers would have concentrated more on the film they were making rather than eyeing the one they might make next. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESVampires I know what you are.

Photo Scott Garfield/? 2010 Screen Gems Inc. All Rights Reserved. ALL IMAGES ARE PROPERTY OF SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT INC. FOR PROMOTIONAL USE Are human actors irreplaceable? Are they always better than CGI? In Priest the communion-wafer thin pseudo-religious vampire action flick from Scott Charles Stewart itas debatable Obviously humans have certain inborn talents that make them a directoras first choice when casting say people. Theyare fleshy and hairy a and hair and skin are notoriously difficult to animate. Also they emote. In an apocalyptic cartoon like this however a talented actor like Paul Bettany can actually be distractingly counterproductive If his role (hes a priest) were played by a robot you wouldnt wonder why for instance his homily was limited to lines like ""Godspeed"" or ""God help us."" You often wouldnt question why a Claymation character spouts press-one-for-character-development lines like ""I have questions ... doubts ... "" When you watch Bettany you cant help wondering why the hell a talented actor is stuck in such an ungodly mess. By the time this humorless monster movie groans through its complicated giggle-inducing premise introducing the latter days of the Wild West-True Blood-Blade Runner-Bioshock Papal Post-apocalypse there have been at least three world-historical plot twists that make next to no sense. The worst is the premise of the franchise that massive human armies with cannons and tanks are ineffective against vampires whereas special dudes with crosses tatttooed on their faces can kill them easily with magical throwing-star crucifixes and cool knives. The movies world based on a series of manga novels that sound much more complex is essentially the fantasy of the religious kid who peruses the fake weaponry for sale at the strip-mall dojo Dude I could kill a million bad guys with one of these ... If the world-sweeping plot is ridiculous the character-driven storyline is incidental. In an early scene a family is murdered by a ravenous hoard of beasties eyeless doglike vampires who look like the unholy spawn of skinless saber tooth tigers and a Ring-hungry Gollum. It turns out that the young girl who is kidnapped and the man who is murdered are the daughter and brother of Priest (thats the only name given to Paul Bettanys character despite the fact that he is but one priest among many and his colleagues must get wickedly jealous). When the Church wont listen Priest sets out into a desert called the Wasteland to rescue his daughter and destroy an entire trainful of vampires himself. There are lots of seemingly identical vampire monsters which may have made them easier to animate and certainly makes them easier to forget. There are some other humans too Priest gets negligible help from Priestess (Maggie Q) who throws rocks up in the air so Priest can jump from one to the next like Super Mario. As a Barney Fife sheriff Cam Gigandet spends the film delivering variations of one line -- that he doesnt want Priest to kill the girl whom he loves even if shes been turned into a vampire. On the monsterss side theres Karl Urban growling as Black Hat a very bad priest who has evolved into a classic long-fang vampire doomed for all eternity to say lines like ""I can smell the blood running through your body It smells like dinner."" The film does seem to speed by though thats less because of zippy plotting and more because its just short. About an hour and twenty minutes of screen time are barely filled with expert but unimaginative action sequences silly bullet-time punches and chases on motorcycles that go zooooom when the Priests press the ""Nitro"" button. At the end one wonders is it over? ""No its just beginning"" says the Bettany and the scene turns just so corny perhaps no person could have saved it. So maybe humans are just distracting in some films That line wouldnt have been any worse or any more ridiculous had it been given to one of the vampires.

(Scott Garfield) Joe Neumaier Friday May 13 2011 332 PM Title Priest A specially-trained priest battles vampires in a postapocalyptic landscape. With Paul Bettany Cam Gigandet Karl Urban. Director Scott Charles Stewart. (127) PG-13 Violence. At area theaters.It appears that turning the John Ford/John Wayne classic ""The Searchers"" into the church-vs-vampire adventure ""Priest"" was not an altogether god-awful idea. As long as we dont get ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" as an elegiac zombie drama this adaptation of a graphic novel has some bite.Mixing about four different genres into its first few minutes ""Priest"" settles down into a postapocalyptic world rebuilding after a war with vampires during which the most effective soldiers on the side of mankind were specially-chosen and trained priests. In the crowded industrial-grade cities the church controls all aspects of life though its a real absentee landlord and its lead monsignor (Christopher Plummer) is a corrupt autocrat.Outside the cities theres a familiar movie-movie wasteland - its the landscape Mad Max roamed or where Charlton Heston fought intelligent Apes or where Denzel Washington battled evil in ""The Book of Eli"" - and a young homesteader girl (Lily Collins) has been kidnapped by a roving band of vampires and their half-vamp servants led by a fiend (Karl Urban Dr. McCoy in the rebooted ""Star Trek"") with a black hat and a Clint Eastwood rasp.The girl is the niece of a priest (Paul Bettany) who like his fellow vamp-hunters of the cloth has been relegated to outcast status. When he goes in search of her he finds the girls lawman-boyfriend (Can Gigandet) and the two go off to save her aided by a priestess (Maggie Q) and a smock full of tiny killer crucifixes.Director Scott Charles Stewart who directed the similar Bettany-starrer ""Legion"" doesnt hide the ""Searchers"" homages so much so that they stop being a stake in cinephiles hearts and begin to become fun. A former visual effects guy Stewart also makes sure his vampires have a distinctive look; theyre like angry speechless fanged slugworms with slimy bear bodies. Their minions resemble Uncle Fester and like the vamps they have a shimmery sheen to their white skin.Bettany does the monosyllabic stranger bit well and Gigandet apparently studied Jeffrey Hunters male ingenue in ""The Searchers"" so well that when he learns a secret about the girl and the priest he barely registers emotion. No matter; if you come to ""Priest"" for emotion or for a serious dissection of God-versus-the Church ideas youve arrived at the wrong movie. If however youre looking for a diverting sci-fi actioner that handily mixes the DNA of several different movies with a few flying crosses thrown in and a heavy dose of Western mythology sink your teeth in.Dont Miss  An all-round rousing fight atop a moving train transport. In a movie full of Western film cliches this is one it manages to make extra-exciting.

Posted May 25 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT Adapted from a graphic-novel series (and what isnt these days?) this unholy mess of horror and Western cliches is at least blessed with a wonderfully loony premise. A band of superpowered priests is all that stands between mankind (or whats left of it in a church-led dystopia) and hordes of vampires -- not the sullen beau-hunk kind mind you but eyeless mucus-covered monsters. When his niece is kidnapped by the creatures one renegade man of the cloth (Paul Bettany) teams with a gun-toting sheriff (Cam Gigandet) and a priestess (Maggie Q) to rescue her. Directed by Scott Charles Stewart (Legion) the movie manages some evocative sooty visuals and a few decent action sequences. But its B-movie sins are many worst among them an icy hero and a plot that feels like it was built from relics of other better films. C?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There was a time when a post-apocalyptic Western adapted from a series of Korean graphic novels about a vampire-hunting killer priest might have possessed some small element of novelty especially if it was projected in the once-anachronistic medium of 3-D. Such a film might have seemed a tad offbeat if not outright quirky. Our culture increasingly resembles a 3-D hybridization machine however so Priest now feels more like standard-issue popcorn fare than a crazy cult classic in the making. Its all Pride And Prejudice And Zombies these days. The geeks have taken over and the icy achingly inessential Priest suggests that isnt inherently a positive development. In a performance more physical than psychological Paul Bettany stars as the title character a religious warrior who leaves the priesthood and his gated city to travel into the wild and track down a rogue aggregation of vampires who blithely disregard the law against killing human beings. The perpetually ridiculous Cam Gigandet truly the Troy Donahue of our time co-stars as an Old West-style lawman who joins Bettany in his hunt to track down the mysterious figure (Karl Urban) who kidnapped Bettanys daughter. Bettanys performance consists entirely of a purposeful frown paired with a menacing glare He goes about his godly business with solemn no-frills intensity. The film follows suit. The only actor who seems to appreciate the inherent ridiculousness of a post-apocalyptic 3-D Western about a killer priest is Urban who has a wonderful moment where his minions destroy a town in the background while he flutters his hands dramatically as if conducting the mayhem himself. During that moment the film realizes its potential as B-movie Grand Guignol camp. Otherwise Priest takes itself way too seriously. At least it deserves credit for efficiency It doesnt waste time with subplots or convoluted mythology. The simplistic directness of its storytelling is refreshing. Its as if the filmmakers realize theyre wasting everyones time so they at least want to take up as little of it as possible.

TWITTER ""The Da Vinci Codes"" Paul Bettany dons another cleric robe for a creature feature that borrows heavily from various film formulas. LONDON -- Priest directed by Scott Stewart is a short dour and stodgy creature feature with average 3D effects that draws on so many film influences from westerns action adventures and sci-fi tales that what fun there is comes from spotting the many sources. Set in some nameless apocalyptic past or future its a vicars-versus-vampires yarn that aside from a short animated scene setter at the start and the long credits crawl at the end lasts for about 80 minutes. Lacking marquee names and much in the way of thrills its unlikely to linger very long at the local multiplex and the blatant set up for a sequel after the climactic battle appears almost pitiable. The animated sequence establishes that mankind has retreated within the giant walls of vile polluted cities after innumerable battles with their vampire enemies who are now confined to hideous underground camps a long way away. All that corporal mortification in The Da Vinci Code was apparently not enough for Paul Bettany. He has the title role of another venomous cleric known only as Priest who this time has been put out to pasture by the church that rules with an iron fist over whats left of humankind. Two sequences set up what will follow in a rag-tag script by Cory Goodman. One has elements of Indiana Jones as a band of soldier-preachers run into a trap set by vampires in an underground maze and Priest fails to save his best mate (Karl Urban) who falls into the clutches of thirsty beasts. The other has a Western touch as crazed attackers invade a solitary home far out in the wasteland leave the Priests brother and his wife for dead and kidnap their daughter Lucy (Lily Collins). Back in the Blade Runner city on a very bad day Priest tells the church elders that he wants his badge back to he can go rescue Lucy. As a droll but insistent Monsignor Christopher Plummer orders him not go anywhere as Christopher Youngs choral score starts to soar. The Priest promptly leaves on a souped up motorcycle and teams with a local lawman Hicks (Cam Gigandet) to seek the girl. Now its The Searchers as the embittered older man learns that Hicks is in love with Lucy but has to make it clear that if she has been bitten by the vampires then he will have to kill her. Monsignor sends a team of priests led by Priestess (Maggie Q) to hunt down Priest but shes really on the renegades side so now the three of them track the vampires to some kind of mountain thats shaped like a bee-hive and is in fact called a hive. Inside theres a large bouncy creature with nasty habits and no face but teeth like the creature from Aliens 2. Inevitably Priests lost friend shows up the worlds first human vampire known as Black Hat and looking for all the world like a man with no name except that his eye teeth come to exceptional points. Turns out he likes railway trains and he plans to transport a new army of vampires on a vast train to attack the city and he kidnapped Lucy just to lure Priest out so he could kill him. Priest Priestess and Hick must stop the train before the villains can do any harm and now the references come thick and fast. Once Upon a Time In the West competes with Mad Maxs ""Roadrunner"" as Priest and Black Hat fight it out on top of the train while Hicks stumbles along in carriages filled with pods like the ones in Invasion of the Body Snatchers. If that sounds like fun its really not.

Not exactly an unholy mess but still a rather too pious retread of classic sci-fi/action/horror riffs that lacks originality or pizzazz ""Priest"" wont strike much awe in anyone. Paul Bettany channeling Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name stars as vampire-slaying man of the cloth who goes rogue in a Steampunk-style parallel world to save a family member in peril. The use of 3D -- applied in post rather than shot on stereoscopic cameras - reps a major selling point but in a market still crowded with such fare thats not saying much. Pic opened reasonably wide in Blighty on May 6. Based on the same-named graphic novel by Hyung Min-woo the script by Cory Goodman posits a world where human beings and vampires -- the slimy bestial non-talking kind -- have been at war for centuries. The bloodsuckers were supposedly vanquished in the recent past by an order of martial-arts-skilled priests who are under the strict control like everyone else of a quasi-fascist version of the Catholic Church. Still the human race plays it safe by dwelling mostly in the confines of walled cities that would recall ""Blade Runner"" if they werent so drained of color. One former vamp-hunting cleric (Bettany) known only as ""priest"" throughout struggles to fit into a society where his butt-kicking skills are no longer much needed. In a desolate plain somewhere beyond the cities the homestead of Owen Pace (Stephen Moyer) is suddenly attacked by a huge hoard of vampires who kill his wife (Madchen Amick) and kidnap his 18-year-old daughter Lucy (Lily Collins). Lucys sweetheart local sheriff Hicks (Cam Gigandet) asks the priest to help him rescue Lucy knowing that she was in fact the priests niece. The church as repped by Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) forbids him to help Hicks because to admit there are still vampires about would be an act of heresy. The priest defies him and sets out with Hicks to track Lucy down necessitating travel on some cool-looking elongated motorcycles across the dry Southern California lakebeds used partly as locations here. Orelas sends an envoy of four other priests to hunt down our hero but one priestess (Maggie Q) breaks away to find the priest and warn him. It transpires that Lucy has been kidnapped by the priest and priestess former colleague (Karl Urban) who has been turned into the first of an entirely new species of human-vampire hybrid. In the hands of visual-effects maven-turned-helmer Scott Stewart (whose debut ""Legion"" also starred Bettany) ""Priest"" rattles along briskly enough to make for a diverting blessedly short 87-minute running time. Pic manages to blend many disparate looks and genres from oaters via the ""Mad Max"" pics to 1968s ""Witchfinder General"" yet still feels oddly anonymous; the most striking sequence is an animated prologue that skillfully marries the aesthetics of graphic novels and 3D spatial construction. Given the limitations imposed by the banal dialogue the actors comport themselves with dignity with Bettany once again showing credible chops as an action man although his priestly garb and tortured spiritual intensity rather confusingly evokes his villain from ""The Da Vinci Code."" Q tries to bring an air of vulnerability to a part that mostly calls for her to swing a lethal-looking fishing line around and plant bombs. Pin-up Gigandet and heavy-for-hire Urban are no better than serviceable. At least some of the supporting players particularly Brad Dourif as a snake-oil salesman and Christopher Plummer are lit just right to bring out the mischievous glints in their eyes. Unsurprisingly given Stewarts background visual effects rep the tech credits strongest suit. The mostly CGI vampires integrate seamlessly with the real-world players and are more strikingly designed than other elements with one beastie recalling a figure from Francis Bacon. Sound design credited to Martin Jacob Lopez and Jussi Tegelman is also aces. PriestProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Screen Gems presentation of a Michael De Luca Prods.

Even playing Charles Darwin in 2009s Creation doesnt seem to have held back the tide and now Bettanys back on the cross for this nuts-and-bolts 3D adaptation of Korean artist Hyung Min-Woos long-running graphic novel series Priest. Bettany plays the otherwise unnamed title character one of a cadre of ass-kicking ascetics trained by the church to fight the scourge of eyeless slug-like vampires that have almost tipped the world into chaos. And when the vamps bump off Priests salt-of-the-earth brother and kidnap his gingham-frocked rosy-cheeked niece our tattooed hero petitions his masters to let him off the leash to stamp out the plague once and for all.Priest follows the current Hollywood vogue for geek-friendly comic-inspired genre mash-ups chucking elements of western horror and sci-fi into its overheated pot. Its predictably effects-heavy and while the CG elements are a little more solid and inventive here than in say Sucker Punch or Jonah Hex the blurry 3D transfer serves to scupper any sense of visual spectacle. Bettany is enjoyably terse in the lead role but he never gets the chance to do any actual acting while the likes of Brad Dourif Christopher Plummer and Alan Jim Robinson Dale are wasted in minor roles. All in all its a painless affair enjoyable enough while it lasts but like its toothsome villains destined to disintegrate in the cold light of day.
