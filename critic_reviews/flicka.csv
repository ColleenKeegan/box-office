Directed by Michael Mayer from a screenplay by Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konner based on the novel ""My Friend Flicka"" by Mary OHara. 94 minutes. Rated PG for brief mild language. Several theaters. Be forewarned The sweet-natured horse tale ""Flicka"" is not your mothers ""My Friend Flicka."" Nor is it my mothers either; she a fan of the 1941 Mary OHara novel was horrified to hear of the liberties taken in this modern re-imagining. Here 10-year-old Ken McLaughlin (played by Roddy McDowell in the popular 1943 film) is transformed into 16-year-old Katy McLaughlin (Alison Lohman) who struggles to get along with her father (Tim McGraw). He wants her to go to college she wants to stay on their Wyoming ranch. When she finds a wild mustang and sets out to tame her complications ensue including Katy dressing as a boy to try to win a rodeo contest. OHara surely would have raised an eyebrow. But then again she might have recognized that grade-school-age girls are hard up for non-princessy movies these days and that while ""Flicka"" wanders far from its source the results are still rather charming. The tiny Lohman (whos in her mid-20s but plays teenagers impeccably) sporting a wild tangle of hair makes a tough but sweet heroine. She genuinely seems to find a spark of friendship in her scenes with the black horse Flicka. McGraw is a bit wooden but that suits his stoic character; Maria Bello brings her usual warmth to the thankless role of Katys earth-mother mom. The Wyoming mountains provide a lovely backdrop to some breathtaking scenes such as when Katy heads out on a just-before-dawn ride. And while Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konners screenplay underlines a few points perhaps too emphatically (yes we get that Katy identifies with Flickas wild spirit) Michael Mayers direction is genuinely poignant. This ""Flicka"" may not be a classic but its a nice afternoons entertainment particularly for girls who ride wild horses in their dreams.

Katy McLaughlin (Alison Lohman) and her mother Nell (Maria Bellow) enjoy watching their horses. Photo Photo Credit Merrick Morton McGraw alone cant rein in unruly Flicka 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Flicka Drama. Starring Tim McGraw Maria Bello Alison Lohman and Ryan Kwanten. Directed by Michael Mayer. (PG. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Tim McGraw would make a good Cartwright. Hes definitely got an Adam thing going in the movie ""Flicka"" and maybe on his best day he could fill Bens shoes on the Ponderosa. Unfortunately the rest of the movie doesnt come close to the ""Bonanza"" standard. There are some nice moments and beautiful scenery but the film is often slow and the dialogue is overwrought. And the apparent lesson of the movie? Keep disobeying your parents and youll eventually get your way. ""Flicka"" isnt a bad movie but its still a disappointment for parents who might be hoping for some exceptional American-made family entertainment this year. Films aimed at the 12-year-old female demographic come around only once or twice a year so you always want them to be better than mediocre. The movie takes only the basic elements from the 1940 Mary OHara book ""My Friend Flicka"" about a 10-year-old boy in the 1930s who raises a temperamental brown colt and earns the respect of his father. The book also spawned a hugely successful 1943 movie starring a young Roddy McDowall. ""Flicka"" is about a rebellious 21st century teen named Katy (Alison Lohman) who finds a temperamental black mustang and spends 95 percent of the movie doing the exact opposite of what her father tells her -- endangering herself her family and especially the horse. Her father (McGraw) is cast as kind of a heavy but most responsible adults will see him as the only voice of reason in the film. McGraw who revealed flashes of potential in the ""Friday Night Lights"" movie is strong in the same way that Kurt Russell stands out in Disney movies. Maria Bello (a long way from ""Coyote Ugly"") as his optimistic wife doesnt fare quite as well mostly because a large portion of the movies over-the-top dialogue (""When are you going to look at your daughter and realize shes you"") is heaped upon her character. Lohman 27 in real life is almost old enough to be the mother of the 16-year-old character shes playing but she pulls it off. The biggest problem in the first half of ""Flicka"" is the excessively thunderous score which seems to be overcompensating for the movie not going much of anywhere. The second half becomes increasingly ridiculous especially when the centerpiece action scene gallops by in a confusing blur. The best parts of the movie are the less chaotic moments when the family is around the dinner table having a good time or when director Michael Mayer spends a minute or two capturing a cluster of horses running through the beautiful Wyoming countryside. Youll half expect one of the ""Brokeback Mountain"" guys to walk up to the ranch but then reality hits ""Flicka"" isnt anywhere close to an Oscar-caliber movie. -- Advisory Besides being a 94-minute lesson in insubordination this film contains strong language animals in peril and a scene where Lohmans character is bathing and you can kind of see the side of her right breast.

Comments Flicka A ranchers daughter (Alison Lohman) falls for a wild mustang in this update of the 1941 novel by Mary OHara. Lohman is appropriately tousled as the rebellious teen who identifies with the horse shes struggling to tame but her performance is alternately shrill and pouty. Country music star Tim McGraw had a meatier role in Friday Night Lights; he gets more screen time here playing the stern rugged father but hes saddled late in the film with a hokey speech that would challenge anyones acting skills. The oedipal undercurrent relegates Maria Bello to the sidelines as the girls mom another miscalculation by sophomore director Michael Mayer (A Home at the End of the World). PG 94 min.

"Flicka is right at home on the range - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Flicka is right at home on the range By By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 20 2006 Of the many breathtaking sights in ``Flicka"" (rolling plains mountain views Wyoming sky that stretches on and on and on) the most impressive happens to be Alison Lohmans hair. Whether shes astride a galloping horse or tumbling down a hill her copper locks seem so divinely equine that the actual horses with their lifeless manes terrible bangs and split ends must surely be jealous. This hair is alive. Fortunately so is the rest of this lovably corny adaptation of Mary OHaras grade-school classic ``My Friend Flicka. ""OHaras book and the 1943 weepie it became were about a wayward boy (Roddy McDowell in the 43 version) given a young filly as a lesson to teach him responsibility. This progressive update has a spine. Lohman plays Katy McLaughlin a 16-year-old who has to repeat a year of school because she cant stop thinking about horses or her familys ranch. Her first night home for summer vacation she slips out of her bedroom races into the stable and asks its braying residents ``Who wants to go ridin?"" Its more of an exclamation the way Lohman says it. And you certainly share her excitement after she does.On that ride Katy discovers a wild oil-black mustang. Instantly in love she names it Flicka (Swedish apparently for ``beautiful girl"") and begs her daddy not to sell it.Dad played by an affecting Tim McGraw in a sad hairpiece sells it anyway and modest familial angst ensues. That scene of the sale is the only bad moment in Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konners screenplay. Flicka has to go but not before Katys strapping older brother (Ryan Kwanten ) announces that he hates daddy and he hates the stupid ranch and hes going East -- to BU. Dad yells back. Katy cries for the horse. And mom (Maria Bello) urges them all to chill.But by this point the film which Michael Mayer directed has taken care to convincingly demonstrate that the McLaughlins are a loving family. In one romantic scene on horseback mom and dad are even shown discussing how to resolve this hiccup in their harmony. You can feel the love all over this movie. In fact there might be too much. Several scenes were required for me to believe that Lohman and Kwanten werent more than siblings. Not all his glances seem brotherly -- yet theres nothing creepy or untoward about him either. Its love man.The best parts of ``Flicka"" are its pinch-me optimism and its old-fashioned-movie flourishes. Eventually Katy goes after the horse with hazardous abandon. And her reckless courage affords us some cliffhanger-style swipe editing and the sight of a feverish Lohman doing some terrific thrashing in her bed. ``Flickaaaa"" she moans.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Flicka Now Its About a Girl But This Is One Tough Girl washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Flicka Now Its About a Girl But This Is One Tough Girl Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 20 2006 Depending on your point of view the best thing or the worst thing about the new ""Flicka"" is that it has no time for fibberty-gibberty about ""feelings."" Its much more interested in how people get the job done western-style and that involves grit labor and discipline. Then for fun they go jump off perfectly fine horses to roll in the dirt with angry squealing cows in something called ""rodeo"" So those seeking a softer approach to the realities of both child- and animal-rearing should search elsewhere. The rest of us meanwhile are free to enjoy a well-made family drama pitched to young adults thats honest tough and surprisingly engaging. Its based (as have been several other movies and a 1950s TV series) on Mary OHaras 1941 classic ""My Friend Flicka."" That book told the story of the dreamy younger son of a Wyoming rancher who found focus and love in his admiration for a mustang foal whom he named Flicka (Swedish for ""little girl"") and raised despite his fathers disdain. But in persevering against the will of the animal and the will of the father he proved -- mainly to himself -- that he too had a will of iron. This edition perhaps inevitably performs a sex change on the material As director Michael Mayer ably tells the story it focuses on the younger daughter of a stern rancher though the diagnosis is the same. Shes dreamy and flighty what most educators would recognize as dead giveaway for ""creative"" but anathema in the practical world of horse ranching in the high mountains of the Cowboy State. Not that 16-year-old Katy (Alison Lohman) is a softy. In a private-school classroom she can hardly force herself to pay attention; in the real world she can ride like a boy and rope like a man and she loves the Goose Bar Ranch on which her father is perched like her fathers father and perhaps before him. And who could blame the two of them for loving a landscape so vivid and beautiful? Having disgraced herself in school -- her dad Rob (singer Tim McGraw) has scrimped and saved to put her in a posh private joint called the Laramie Academy though having seen Laramie I doubt there are any real academies full of blazered and kilted tenth-formers -- she returns home and quickly falls in love. With a horse. This phenomenon of girls and big horses has been much commented upon in venues from the psychiatric to the literary to the meetings of saddle-marketing executives and ""Flicka"" takes it for granted that everybody gets it. Well I got it; I have a daughter and her mother and I decided at one point that it was either horses or boys so we encouraged horses and of course for our troubles got both horses and boys. At least Rob doesnt have to deal with boy problems although his horse problems kick hard and long. Horse problem No. 1 is that the Goose Bar raises purebred quarter horses; thus a mustang foal is a potential genetic contaminant to the product in that the boy horses (boys being boys) may git a lil too durn interested in the new gal than in the old gals and the various uncontrolled interbreeding will mess up a lot of plans. But the real issue is as before will. It was OHaras genius 65 years ago to play two contests of wills against each other the fathers against the childs and the childs against the horses. They seem at cross-purposes but in that funny way things have of working out maybe theyre not. So the movie essentially tracks both contests as the girl tries to break the horse and the parent tries to break the daughter. But unlike a great number of movies similar to this topic of late -- ""Thirteen"" and ""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou"" come to mind -- neither process is pathologized The girl the movie presumes has every right to break the horse as having roped Flicka and brought her in the horse is now property. Likewise the dad is never portrayed as a monster for seeking to dominate his daughter -- it used to be called ""discipline"" -- and the movie insists throughout that though strong of spirit and perhaps misguided he is not a bad man and can ultimately learn to change and love in a more appropriate manner. McGraw whos done a bit of acting in addition to his fabulous Camp;W career carries his part with a great deal of easy majesty. Rob is a man anybody whos spent any time in the West will know strong laconic hardheaded -- yet absolutely the man youd want in the foxhole next to you or on the opposite side of a deal because hell be square-shooting and word-keeping till the end of time. McGraw gets this and though he dominates the movie its never harshly; you see his love behind his sternness. Then theres Maria Bello as his wife another actress who always manages to ring true even in a piece of junk like ""Coyote Ugly."" And finally Lohman. She broke through big-time a few years back in ""White Oleander"" (where Michelle Pfeiffer was her supporting actress) and this movie gives her the room to play hardscrabble tough. Shes got true grit all the way through and watching her I thought John Wayne would get it. In fact hed get the whole dang movie Flicka (94 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for language.

But bighearted and beautifully shot as it is this latest film version (the original starred Roddy McDowall the Alison Lohman of 1943 as the misfit trainer of a ""loco"" horse) cant buck its public-library mustiness despite a blaring pop/country soundtrack. As for our heroine (Lohman) her archetypal struggle with crusty Pa (uncrusty Tim McGraw) feels attitude-heavy and life-lesson-light.

Its not really either an animal or a kids film but rather a young adult drama that rings emotionally true with nary a manufactured note struck. But without a concerted marketing push this sharply observed and acted story could be perceived as an old-hat family entry. Updated and overhauled from its 65-year-old source novel to speak to the contemporary American West ""Flicka"" is a wonderful film in search of an appropriately sized audience. To call this the best horse-and-kid picture since ""The Black Stallion"" a quarter century ago is true but misleading; its not really either an animal or a kids film but rather a young adult drama that rings emotionally true with nary a manufactured note struck. But without a concerted marketing push -- or even so much as pre-Sunday newspaper ads -- to suggest theres something special here this sharply observed and acted story could be perceived as an old-hat family entry with underachieving theatrical results a likely self-fulfilling prophecy. As Mary OHaras time-tested tale of hard-won maturity has been reconceived for a female lead and cast with exceptional care by a leading theater director it is apparent from the outset the filmmakers were aiming at something more than a run-of-the-mill remake. What emerges is this years acutely sensitive study of emotional turmoil set against the majestic backdrop of a Wyoming ranch. The central character is now Katy McLaughlin (Alison Lohman) a boarding school student who heads home to her familys Wyoming ranch home after having daydreamed her way through her final exam. Pretty and stubborn and clearly unresolved about many things Katy is scarcely the privileged rich girl she at first appears to be; the family may have inherited some beautiful land but Katys tradition-minded father Rob (Tim McGraw) struggles to make a go of it breeding quarter horses with the resilient support of his clear-headed wife Nell (Maria Bello) and isnt sure what he can expect from Katy or her brawny older brother Howard (Ryan Kwanten). The transformation taking place throughout the West in demographics and character charges the film with a vibrant and very accurate undercurrent. In the inflexible often unrealistic way Rob sticks to time-worn attitudes this middle-aged cowboy expresses the anxieties of a man who doesnt want to imagine not passing on his way of life to his kids but who knows he could cash in by selling his land for subdivision to out-of-state rich folks -- its happening all around him. Katys behavior exacerbates everything. Not only does it look as though shell have to repeat her year at school but she becomes taken with a wild black mustang she puts in a small corral and begins trying to tame expressly against her fathers orders. To him the steed is dangerous untrainable worthless. To Katy Flicka is a reflection of herself a pure manifestation of the freedom she seeks but which must be harnessed focused disciplined. Conflicts mount steadily in Mark Rosenthal and Lawrence Konners economical cleanly articulated screenplay which isnt afraid of high school-level symbolism and metaphors when they happen to be apt and mutually enriching to character and theme. Fed up with his daughters obstinacy Rob sells Flicka (Swedish for ""pretty girl"") to become a rodeo horse. Just as Rob feels pushed to the brink of deciding to sell the ranch Nell a smart cookie with likely Eastern roots makes him see the obvious -- that Katy is just like him. This realization doesnt mean father and daughter dont continue to butt heads however especially when Katy with Howards connivance dresses like a boy (one with a remarkable resemblance to Johnny Depp) in order to ride Flicka in the summer rodeos mustang race to win the money to buy him back. Bracingly this does not go at all according to plan or to Hollywood convention these days but instead leads to near-tragedy and honestly earned emotion as family members come to see one another for who they are. Director Michael Mayer following his uneven but creditable indie feature debut ""A Home at the End of the World"" here fluently negotiates the dramatic fluctuations. His film technique isnt yet entirely smooth but he is greatly aided by lenser J. Michael Muro who debuted as a d.p. on Kevin Costners similarly rich and emotive oater ""Open Range"" and here serves up a darkly textured widescreen tapestry. Cutting is drum tight and composer Aaron Zigman largely avoids the typical wall-to-wall musical slatherings of most contempo heart-tuggers. ""Flicka"" could so easily have gone wrong in one direction by being cutesy and manipulative or in another by indulging in rote dysfunctional family posturing. Mayer steers clear of these shoals thanks to good dramatic instincts and perfectly chosen actors. Lohman 25 when the film was shot still passes convincingly as a high schooler and doesnt sacrifice an ounce of Katys intensity by shrewdly underplaying in an ideal performance. Country-Western star McGraw having passed muster in his bigscreen debut in ""Friday Night Lights"" looks like the genuine article as a rancher and carries off his serious scenes with aplomb. Bello turns what could have been a bland stand-around-supportively wife into a vibrant woman committed to her husband and creative enough to help him change; the subject is never broached but McGraw and Bello strongly convey the impression of a still frisky and lusty relationship between long-marrieds. For the record OHaras 1941 novel ""My Friend Flicka"" was first put onscreen in 1943 in a popular Fox release starring Roddy McDowall. OHara wrote two sequels ""Thunderhead Son of Flicka"" in 1943 and ""Green Grass of Wyoming"" in 1946 each of which was filmed two years after publication. The well-remembered TV series ran for 39 episodes in 1955-56. FlickaProductionA 20th Century Fox release of a Fox 2000 Pictures presentation of a Gil Netter production. Produced by Netter.
