Partly a joyful document of San Franciscos 1970s gay movement as seen through the life and work of one local civil rights campaigner Milk is also a memorial to a coming-together of people under one flag and a punch in the face of those who still hold back the pace of progress with initiatives like the recent Proposition 8. By making a film thats solidly political but also touchingly personal Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black have achieved something similar to Larry Kramers Aids play The Normal Heart in the mid-80s a story of campaigners that puts real gay relationships and the conflict between public protest and private love at its heart. Only this time its the death of one man not thousands that colours the drama. Milk was an exuberant New Yorker who moved to San Francisco in his early forties opened a camera store in the citys burgeoning gay district and on his third attempt in 1977 was elected to the board of city supervisors. Milk served only 11 months before he and the citys liberal mayor George Moscone were shot in their offices but he built a strong reputation not least as a voice in opposition to senator John Briggss Proposition 6 aiming to ban gays from teaching in schools.Milks death inspired a candlelit march on the streets of San Francisco  and in 1984 initiated an Oscar-winning documentary by Robert Epstein from which Van Sant takes many prompts. You can see too that Sean Penn has closely studied  Milks slightly awkward physical presence and upbeat attitude. Van Sants cinematographer Harris Savides also takes his cue from the archive theres so much real and recreated news footage in the film that he develops an evocative grainy palette of muted colours to match it. Yet while documentary-style realism is mostly the order of the day Van Sant also mixes in more impressionistic often music-filled moments especially when focusing on Milks love life. Location is key the filmmakers shot in  the streets of San Francisco so we enjoy the same powerful sense of place as we did with the house in Last Days or the high school in Elephant. Van Sant reveals Milks death at the beginning before leaping back to New York and his first encounter with partner Scott (James Franco). From there he plays it straight only jumping forward to show Milk dictating a tape to be played in the event of his death. Tragedy is woven into the films lining but the filmmakers avoid laying on any ideas of destiny or martyrdom giving as much due to the movement as the man. The story is sad but the mood is jubilant and the energy relentless. Penn is a revelation as Milk. Hes always been a no-holds-barred actor but this is another departure his energy drives the story. Josh Brolin impresses too as Dan White Milks conflicted conservative colleague at City Hall. But its also a great ensemble piece Milk surrounded himself with friends and actors like Emile Hirsch and Diego Luna add colour to a film that shows politics can offer more than one definition of the word party.

Until this film was released I didnt know about Harvey Milk or how he created the force of the movement out of his feeling that he hadnt achieved anything he was proud of on his 40th birthday. The film was filled with conversations that anyone from minority background can identify with. Feeling persecuted afraid and powerless they managed to channel that into a big social momentum and movement. I notice that there are several people here who gave a big thumbs down to this film but I guess they must be from a truly privileged background who felt no reason to stand up to challenge the system although I understand that sometimes you need to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate a film like this. If you are a gay lesbian or bisexual just shut up and go and see it. Youll definitely find something to take home with. I certainly better appreciate the liberty and general social acceptance we take for granted today and how fragile these can be given the history of the fight they had to fight so hard.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 14 2009TTFeaturedThis is the first biopic film in recent history where I was moved by how the person lived his life rather than how the actors delivered true-to-life performance.

The direction from Gus was great and more accessible than his recent work the acting the portrayal of a time partly achieved by the interspersing of real clips and the structure were brilliant. But perhaps most importantly the film was just damn enjoyable and far more interesting and engaging than all the other oscar nominations I have seen including The Reader which was a bit shit samey and un-authentic and slumdog millionaire which might be the best film of the year for a 10 year old who likes a fairytale ""dressed up"" with violence bangin tunes plot devices that dont quite work fast camera action and a nicely resolved happy bollywood dance number ending despite charting every level of child degradation possible to keep them entertained... Maybe you would have been better off booking tickets for slumdog. It wasnt like this was even a slow or long film e.g. The curious case of Benjamin button it is around the same length as both mentioned and was filled with things happening whilst still allowing you to invest emotionally in the characters and their situation. And I thought as a political drama had far more to say and document than frost/Nixon.

The crowd scenes have no force or feeling; most lacking is the penultimate one where Milk contrives to defuse a riot. Not a drop of tension. Sean Penn Diego Luna and Josh Brolin are all immediately convincing as their respective characters; James Franco might be really good too but hes just too beautiful for his acting to be visible. Its impossible to tell whether or not hes any good. Not a bad film but a disappointing one I thought.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 25 2009samFeaturedJust seen this with my wife as Slumdog full up.

Some call him ""the gay Martin Luther King Jr."" The two men shared something else besides their passion for equality -- they were both were assassinated in the prime of their influence. I live in California at the moment which most people assume to be the most liberal state in the union. After all San Francisco where Milk was elected to the Board of City Supervisors in 1977 is like homo-central right? I bring this up because California the allegedly most liberal state in the union just passed an anti-gay marriage amendment to block a recent state Supreme Court decision allowing gays and lesbians to marry. Harvey Milk whose campaign against an even more disgusting proposition in 1978 comprises the second half of his biopic would be devastated. Thirty years ago Proposition 6 attempted to ban homosexuals from teaching in the state and would have forced employers to fire anyone who knowingly supported homosexuals in the school system. Seriously. The rhetoric used to support this prop was so ridiculous Milk director Gus Van Sant had to use archival news footage since recreating it would have sounded too comical. Similar rhetoric like the idea that gay marriage would somehow make schools into gay recruitment stations was used to support Proposition 8 this year here in California the allegedly most liberal state in the union where apparently we havent come that far in three decades. Sorry got off on a bit of an ideological rant there. (Im sure some of you will be offended; feel free to post some hate that supports my argument.) Youre reading this to hear about the movie but in a way everything I just brought up pertains to the movie. Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black have created a wonderful historical accounting of a man (played by Sean Penn delivering an Oscar-worthy performance) who gave everything he had including his life in the pursuit of basic human rights as we -- or at least as our Founding Fathers -- understood them to be. (San Francisco Mayor George Moscone was also killed in the double homicide) I spent half the movie sick to my stomach literally nauseated by the recreation of an era and the hate-mongering that defined it and the other half stuck somewhere between teary eyed and sobbing over how despicable a culture it is that can talk about bringing democracy and equal rights to repressed women in foreign lands while actively campaigning to limit and even strip equal rights from a significant percentage of our own population. This is the power of Milk and more people need to be made aware that its at the local cineplex. Milk as the movie makes clear believed that the best way to confront bigotry against homosexuals was by direct interaction by humanizing gays and lesbians by putting familiar faces on them. Milk the movie is powerful enough to do just that. If youre interested in my critical assessment of it as a motion picture because I didnt dwell on who else starred in it or how Black framed the story -- know its one of Van Sants best movies to date. At the moment its my favorite movie of the year in fact. Lets see if The Curious Case of Benjamin Button can change that sentiment.

Comments click to enlarge Milk Recommended Watch on Amazon Rated R  2009 Like Spike Lees Malcolm X (1992) this moving biopic about the slain gay-rights activist Harvey Milk is not only the story of a political leader but a political event in its own right introducing mainstream moviegoers to a martyred hero and implicitly championing his ideals. Known in San Francisco as the Mayor of Castro Street Milk pulled off an impressive balancing act in the mid-70s though he worked tirelessly for gay rights he also assembled an unlikely power base of gays hippies seniors union members and small-business owners that catapulted him to elective office on the citys board of supervisors. Sean Penn gives a meticulously detailed performance as the cagey and charismatic pol but credit should also go to Dustin Lance Black whose script squarely locates Milk at the center of his community his city and his cause.

"Movie review Milk -- 5 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Milk -- 5 out of 5 stars In 1977 Harvey Milk was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors becoming the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in America. His victory was not just a victory for gay rights; he forged coalitions across the political spectrum. This is his story. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Democracy at the street level makes for great theater. Shipyard workers in Gdansk Poland the newly enfranchised in Selma Ala. or the newly liberated in Baghdad -- ""people power"" is electrifying to behold. Milk the long long awaited bio-film of gay politician and ""community organizer"" Harvey Milk is filled with such political thrills. Its about a man who pioneered the cause was elected to office as an openly gay man and who was martyred just as he always predicted. This history brought vividly to life by filmmaker Gus Van Sant and a great cast led by Sean Penn debuts as a ""community organizer"" has won the presidency and the country wrestles again with gay rights.Milk doesnt waste a moment in telling Harveys story. From the opening credits a montage of vintage TV and newsreel footage of police raids on gay bars in the 60s it gives us context personalities the stakes in the struggle and one who saw the big picture. Harvey Milk was a 40-something gay Republican when he moved to San Francisco in the early 70s. He opened a camera shop on Castro Street and did the math as he watched passers-by. If he could organize gay people this distressed neighborhood would come back to life become a ""gay Mecca."" Van Sant working from Dustin Lance Blacks script shows us that transformation in quick strokes -- business owners who journey from hatred to profit unions earning gay help to win contracts -- with police harassment and murderous gay-bashing as a backdrop.That prompts Milk to run for office.""My fellow degenerates"" he jokes as he announces his first race for city supervisor ""I want to recruit you.""Milk takes us back to the 1970s culture wars when orange juice spokeswoman Anita Bryant fought gay civil rights ordinances in Florida and elsewhere railing that ""Gay people cant reproduce. They have to recruit."" Penn in a soft but passionate portrayal takes us into Milks big heart his penchant for younger men who ""need my help"" and his ruthless political savvy. Van Sant surrounds Penn with terrific support starting with a nicely matured James Franco playing his lover Scott. Emile Hirsch who starred in Penns film Into the Wild dazzles as Cleve Jones a young hustler Harvey enlists radicalizes and trains in the cause.Josh Brolin gives nuance and sympathy to Dan White the ex-cop supervisor who found himself increasingly at odds with Milk losing his own dreams of the city and conservatives shrinking place within it.Milk is framed within Penns narration on tape of a will ""in the event of my assassination"" and never strays far from the facts of Harvey Milks life and death hewing closely to such biographies as Randy Shilts The Mayor of Castro Street. Van Sant weaves news footage of the day into the story turning this moving and inspiring biography into a history lesson a civics lesson and a personal struggle for civil rights.Perhaps it is simply an accident of timing that puts Milk in theaters at this moment. But fate or simple fortunate timing Milk arrives as one of the best films of 2008.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor November 28 2008 Save for later Saved Sean Penn stars as real-life gay rights icon Harvey Milk in director Gus Van Sants MILK a Focus Features release. Courtesy of Phil Bray / Focus Features          View Caption About video ads View Caption of San Francisco City supervisor Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man to hold major political office in America. In 1978 along with Mayor George Moscone he was shot dead in City Hall by Dan White an unbalanced fellow supervisor.""Milk"" which stars Sean Penn is about the last eight years of Milks life and its less a biopic than a call to arms. As directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Dustin Lance Black its an attempt to both humanize and canonize the martyred activist. Essentially the film is saying that at a time when civil rights for gays are still under attack there is no one of Milks charisma on the scene to lead the charge.The excellent Oscar-winning 1984 documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" did a much better job of bringing his story to life than this dramatized hodgepodge which mixes fictional footage with snatches of newsreel clips from the era. We keep getting yanked back and forth between the actual and the virtual and the actual wins out just about every time. (There is no way for example for Van Sant to compete with the famous live TV clip of Dianne Feinstein outside City Hall breaking the news of the shootings so he wisely doesnt try.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? A grim note is set from the very beginning when we see Milk dictating his will on tape and expressing his fears of being assassinated. Although the filmmakers can be criticized for heightening the sacrificial lamb aspects of Milks life its also true that Milk himself felt he was predestined to die for the cause. Still the double dose of doom here is a bit much. It saps Milk of his vitality by deifying his fears and converting his sadness into a state of grace. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Milk Penn does his best to balance the mundane with the hagiographic. Its a tribute to his performance that we recognize early on that Milk despite his preening was a deeply unhappy man. Even when hes grandstanding theres something closed off about him something unreachable. Fighting a statewide referendum banning homosexuals from teaching in public schools Milk finds his voice and becomes a crusader but the soapbox is just a stage prop. He only looks comfortable in his skin when hes withdrawing into some private inner place.Employing a thick New York accent and sporting a nose that has been slightly elongated through prosthetics Penn at first seems like a caricature - a theatrical conceit. But he grows into the theatricality and gives it a human dimension. He gives us a long look behind the mask.His counterpart is Josh Brolins Dan White a stocky square-faced hunk. Brolin has really come into his own in recent years with performances in ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""American Gangster"" that would do anybody proud. (I was less enamored of him as Dubya in Oliver Stones ""W"" although that was an impossible assignment.)Brolin is the male equivalent of those actresses (like Michelle Pfeiffer early in her career) who arent taken seriously as artists because theyre too pretty. His matinee idol mug has a vaguely retro feel - he looks like a refugee of the Rock Hudson/Robert Wagner era. But Brolin is remarkably talented and in ""Milk"" he makes entirely believable Whites slide into a sullen rage. In some ways its a more difficult role than Milk because he has fewer colors in his palette. Van Sant tries to simplify Whites psychology by implying that White was a closeted homosexual but Brolins performance rises above such reductions.I wish ""Milk"" had been more of a character piece and less of a manifesto. The movie which has occasional bouts of sexual explicitness portrays the Bay Area activist as almost totally lacking in guile or hypocrisy. There is nothing self-aggrandizing about him. Its all a bit too good to be true. ""Milk"" is an agitprop fantasy about the selflessness of sainthood. If anybody but Penn was playing the saint wed probably feel as if we were being sold a bill of goods. Instead he just about pulls it off. Such is the treachery of talent. Grade B (Rated R for language some sexual content and brief violence.)

Milk (Sean Penn) may not have been the countrys first elected gay leader but he was the first politician out of the closet during his campaigns the fourth of which finally elevated him to office and history. Penn is phenomenal in the role; he and director Gus Van Sant play Milks sexual orientation with candor that never dips into cartoonishness a refreshing and true and manly approach that goes for all the homosexuals in the film including Emile Hirsch as his political attack dog Cleve Jones James Franco as his long-time lover and Diego Luna as his ill-fated fling. Its a feat made even more accomplished by the frank choice not to frame him as a largely asexual saint the other go-to cliche. When Van Sant opens the film with Penn hitting on Franco in the NYC subway its the first time in my knowledge any studio picture has so humanized gay seduction. Milk wouldnt last a year in office. He and the mayor (Victor Garber) would be gunned down by a conservative floundering ex-supervisor named Dan White whom actor Josh Brolin makes feel so lived-in and confused that he covers up for the hollowness of his character in Dustin Lance Blacks script. Milk couldnt be timelier--its centerpieces are a candidate who preaches hope and a bigoted anti-gay rights bill sweeping the country--but as a fine engrossing and moving piece of cinema its appeal will outlast the headlines.

"Review Milk - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Review Milk Milk Phil Bray / Focus Features Sean Penn stars in ""Milk."" Sean Penn stars in ""Milk."" (Phil Bray / Focus Features) KENNETH TURANMovie Critic It was partly an accident of history that made Harvey Milk the first openly gay man elected to major public office in this country so its fitting that yet another accident of history has made ""Milk"" the earnest biopic about the man more involving than it would otherwise be.Milk was elected to San Franciscos Board of Supervisors in 1977 -- after several unsuccessful attempts -- because he had solidified his position as ""the Mayor of Castro Street"" the voice of the citys geographically concentrated gay community at the moment when a change was made from citywide supervisor elections to voting by districts. Also benefiting from that systemic change was a new supervisor named Dan White an ex-firefighter voted onto the board to represent an old-school working-class district. Less than a year after these men took office White assassinated Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and turned a local political squabble into a national tragedy.The idea of a film on these horrific events has been in the works for more than a dozen years with directors including Bryan Singer and Oliver Stone expressing interest. The current film featuring a strong and convincing performance by Sean Penn was directed by Gus Van Sant in the kind of bland heroic mode that has been a Hollywood staple forever. Theres nothing terribly wrong with ""Milk"" its just that its celebration of a culture and a neighborhood its valentine to the early days of gay rights activism is mostly more conventional than compelling.But in one aspect that accident of timing means that Dustin Lance Blacks script eerily echoes a key issue of the moment in a way that gives ""Milk"" more relevance and interest than it would have on its own.Perhaps the defining political fight of Milks career was his successful battle against Proposition 6 a statewide measure that would have banned gays from teaching in California public schools. Milk saw this not as an economic issue but a cultural one a reason for gays to come out of the closet and tell everyone who they are. ""Theyll vote for us 2 to 1"" Milk says in the movie ""if they know one of us.""Its impossible to see ""Milks"" anti-Prop. 6 demonstrations to read signs saying things like ""Gay rights now"" and ""Save our human rights"" without thinking of the very current battle over Proposition 8 and its ban of gay marriage. This graphic demonstration that the struggles are far from over gives ""Milk"" a harder edge than its otherwise self-congratulatory tone could manage. In fact in some way the films most unexpectedly moving footage is what looks to be authentic newsreel material of police raids on gay bars with people furtively hiding their faces to protect their closeted lives. This film wants us to understand both how far weve come as a society and that it is still not far enough.Meet the mentor""Milk"" also owes a large debt (which it acknowledges in the closing credits) to the 1984 Oscar-winning documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk."" It goes so far as opening in the same way with a scene of Milk recording his taped final testament to be played ""only in the event of my death by assassination"" and with newsreel footage of then-Supervisor Dianne Feinstein announcing the double murders.""Milk"" then flashes back eight years to a meet cute on a New York City subway staircase between a still-closeted Milk and a young and hunky Scott Smith (an excellent James Franco). Its the eve of his 40th birthday Milk tells him that night and he felt he hadnt done anything to be proud of.The couple moves to San Francisco where Milk opens Castro Camera but quickly finds he has a gift for people and organizing. When he does a solid for the Teamsters Union by getting archenemy Coors beer out of the areas gay bars his serious political life begins.Though he ran for office three times before his 1977 supervisor victory Milk was moving too fast for the somewhat private local gay establishment. He was messianic about people coming out of the closet and told whoever would listen and even those who wouldnt ""Im not a candidate; Im part of a movement.""Penn as weve come to expect is extremely persuasive as someone with a different more offbeat kind of charisma than many of his previous screen roles. Franco is a nice match for him as the lover who finally has enough of political life. Emile Hirsch also scores points as one of Milks proteges and Josh Brolin is excellent as always as the enigmatic White the man who seemed perfectly normal until he didnt. Its a powerful story.

Hoberman Gus Van Sants Milk Recaptures Californian Intolerance at Exactly the Right Time Wednesday November 26 2008 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 James Franco and Sean Penn portray a couple of guys who just wanted to open a camera shop.Phil Bray A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Gus Van Sant has never been a risk-averse filmmaker but he directs his Harvey Milk biopic so carefully there might be a Ming vase balanced on his head. Van Sants steps are deliberate his posture is straight his attitude is responsible and his eyes are fixed firmly on the prize. No less cautious Sean Penn drops his habitual banty roosterism to play Milk (1930-1978) the martyred gay activist and San Francisco supervisor with the concentration of an actor entrusted to portray the future subject of a U.S. postage stamp.Opening 30 years and a day after Milk and San Francisco mayor George Moscone were gunned down in City Hall by another supervisor ex-cop Dan White Van Sants film is narrated by Milk from beyond the grave--less an exercise in fatalism than a way of giving collective history an engagingly Noo Yawk accent. The film is skillfully edited using archival footage when necessary and working from a detailed script by documentarian Dustin Lance Black Van Sant streamlines Milks life simplifying his trajectory from closeted Wall Street zero to out-front Castro Street hero. On the eve of his 40th birthday Milk picks up cute hippie Scott Smith (James Franco) leaving the subway and after a romantic evening in tight close-up effectively joins the counterculture growing his hair and eloping with Smith to San Francisco. There they open the Castro Camera Shop. When some cheerful canoodling prompts a local Chamber of Commerce type to blackball the enterprise an activist is born ""Well form our own business association""This ringing declaration serves to announce San Franciscos new gay district as an autonomous region with the Castro Camera Shop as its epicenter. It also allows the filmmakers to portray the burgeoning Castro as a function of Milks own political development. (The collective nature of this enterprise is built into the movie itself which not only depicts but in some cases casts Milks associates.) Milk organizes against police harassment and allied with progressive elements in the teamsters union helps ban right-wing elixir Coors from the Castros bars. After San Franciscos most powerful gay figure advises Harvey to simmer down the irrepressible entrepreneur appoints himself Mayor of Castro Street hopping an actual soapbox ""My fellow degenerates."" Losing a run for San Franciscos Board of Supervisors Milk cuts his hair shaves his beard and loses again promptly launching an equally quixotic primary challenge against local state assemblyman and future mayor Art Agnos (Jeff Koons no less).Scarcely less indefatigable Penn is present in nearly every scene. His marked resemblance to Milk--hawkish profile mask-of-comedy smile--is matched by an understanding of his gregarious characters political gifts. The Mayor of Castro Street was a son of the Borscht Belt--a wise guy a tummler part self-deprecating nerd part infectious showoff. (Like Harvey Penn has no difficulty milking it.) More hearty frontier settlement than drag- and disco-fueled den of depravity the Castro blossoms in the warmth of Milks sunny personality. A thousand flowers bloom Abandoned by the long-suffering Smith Milk gets a new campaign manager self-described ""tough dyke"" Anne Kronenberg (pert Alison Pill); a new lover Jack Lira (adorable Diego Luna); and finally a seat on the Board of Supervisors.Happy flirtatious paternal Milk was able to play politics both inside City Hall and out in the streets. San Francisco is the city Republicans love to hate and Milk turns grandly world-historical once the campaign launched by homophobic Christian crusader and Moral Majority avatar Anita Bryant arrives in the form of Proposition 6 an initiative to purge gay teachers (and their supporters) from public schools. The new supervisor finds himself on the front line of the Culture Wars face-to-face with evil twin Dan White (Josh Brolin who better directed here than in W. has the distinction of playing the years two pre-eminent real-life villains).Beleaguered personification of ""family values"" White is the films most complex character after Milk. That their death-match embodies a civil war in the American psyche is implicit in the scripts suggestion that Whites rage--as well as his fascination with Harvey--is fueled by repressed homosexuality. As Milk grows in stature assembling a statewide coalition against Prop. 6 enlisting former governor Ronald Reagan and President Jimmy Carter White goes increasingly nuts--as does Jack and indeed San Francisco. Whites lethal freak-out came 10 days after the S.F.-based Peoples Temple imploded in Guyana.The quintessential 21st-century Gus Van Sant movie has been a boldly experimental death-trip. Elephant and Paranoid Park both fractured chronology Gerry and Last Days distended duration but all revolved around young protagonists whose mortality was never less than self-evident. Milk too has a doomed protagonist but whats experimental here is Van Sants faith in the old-fashioned verites Content trumps form as communal solidarity redeems individual sacrifice.Rob Epstein and Richard Schmiechens groundbreaking 1984 documentary The Times of Harvey Milk spent a third of its length on Whites murder trial including powerful footage of the flaming riots that greeted Whites conviction on a lesser charge of manslaughter. Van Sant prefers to show a community together. He doesnt avert his gaze from Milks death but he wraps it in a comforter of last-day reconciliations romantic flashbacks and ethereal patriotic music.Corny as it is Van Sants ending still packs a wallop. Milk is so immediate that its impossible to separate the movies moment from this one. The 1978 victory over Prop. 6 merges with the current struggle against Californias Proposition 8 overturning the State Supreme Courts ruling on same-sex marriage. A charismatic leader has yet to emerge but there is . . . Milk and its wholehearted devotion to the principle of equal protection under the law. (Sound bites from the filmed demonstrations are near-identical to those culled from those held two weekends ago.)Van Sant and Black position Milk as both gutsy civil rights leader and creative community organizer--not to mention a precedent-shattering politician who its very often reiterated presented himself as a Messenger of Hope. And also Change ""A homosexual with power thats scary"" Milk jokes by way of alerting the viewer that he not only anticipated but understood his assassins motives. Milk is now. The ecstatic reception accorded Wall-Es visionary tikkun (and the president-elects strategic non-support for same-sex marriage) notwithstanding its the first openly Obama-iste movie.Heres hoping that Milk and Penns Milk do as well in our annual fake election. When The Times of Harvey Milk won its Oscar for best documentary presenter Kathleen Turner described it as ""a film about American values in conflict.""

"Milk and Penn are a powerful cinematic combination - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Milk and Penn are a powerful cinematic combination Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Phil Bray Focus Features James Franco left plays a lover of Sean Penns Harvey Milk the San Francisco city supervisor who was assassinated in 1978. WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Milk (  1/2 out of four) has one of the finest ensemble casts this year and a magnificent career-topping performance by Sean Penn who disappears into the title role. Milk refers to Harvey Milk a San Francisco city supervisor who was gunned down in 1978 by fellow politician Dan White (a superb Josh Brolin). The film tells the compelling story of how Milk became the countrys first openly gay man elected to public office. Though he does adhere to some standard conventions of the biopic director Gus Van Sant focuses on Milk in middle age highlighting the arc of his social consciousness and shining a light on key moments in his personal life. He avoids delving into Milks youth or attempting a broad profile. The tighter focus is the right tactic; the story is so riveting that his early years are not missed. Penns fascinating multidimensional portrayal begins when Milk is 40 and living a buttoned-down life with a Wall Street job. Seeking a change Milk and his lover Scott Smith (an engaging natural James Franco) move to San Francisco into the heart of the working-class Castro neighborhood. Milk runs a camera store becomes more outspoken and evolves into an activist forging coalitions with union leaders and seniors. His signature line is ""My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you."" Penn delivers it with wit and conviction. Also turning in compelling performances are Emile Hirsch as free spirit-turned-activist Cleve Jones Alison Pill as campaign worker Anne Kronenberg and Diego Luna as the troubled gay Jack Lira. The film has particular resonance given the history-making presidential election. It is especially evocative because as with President-elect Barack Obama Milks platform was built on hope. It also is timely given the outcome of Proposition 8 in California which resulted in a ban on gay marriage. Mostly though Milk is a powerful drama stirringly told. Milk may have been martyred at the prime of his political life but screenwriter Dustin Lance Black does not attempt to sanctify him. Rather we get a clear-eyed portrait of man who is idealistic determined sardonic and ambitious. Penns Oscar-caliber transformation is breathtaking and the saga of one mans fight for human rights is engrossing. (Rated R for language some sexual content and brief violence.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 26 2008 1159 AM Fresh Milk Gus Van Sants biopic of the gay activist is vibrantly alive. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Milk click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Sean Penn as Harvey Milk in Milk At the heart of every biopic lies an intractable conundrum How do you remain faithful to the historical facts of your subjects life without turning that life into a stodgy historical pageant of the sort parodied in last years Walk Hard? (John C. Reillys rock-star hero meditates with the Beatles in India ""That was freaking transcendental Paul McCartney. Dont you agree John Lennon?"") Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. There are many ways of approaching the Biopic Problem. One is to make an avant-garde film that only indirectly addresses the life of its subject like Todd Haynes off-kilter Dylan bio Im Not There. Another is to embrace stiff biopic-ishness with open arms like Oliver Stones recent W. whose straight-from-the-headlines literality had its own clunky charm.But with Milk (Focus Features) the story of martyred gay rights activist Harvey Milk Gus Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black pull off something very close to magic. They make a film thats both historically precise (allowing for a few compressions and ellipses Milk follows the same arc as Randy Shilts biography The Mayor of Castro Street) and as graceful unpredictable and moving as a good fiction film--that is to say a work of art. Movies about real-life good guys who we know will get it in the end tend to bend inexorably toward the arc of that fatal moment the booth at Fords Theater the intersection in Dallas. Its not that Milk never falls victim to biopic-itis Near the beginning Van Sant provides exposition with a newspaper-headline montage detailing Milks 1978 assassination at the hands of a fellow member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. But the film then shifts back in time to build up a character so vibrantly and specifically imagined that we forget to define Milk by his death. Which is no doubt how Harvey Milk would have preferred it. A good part of this movies impish spirit comes from the simple fact that unlike many saintly biopic subjects Harvey Milk got lots of action and Gus Van Sant isnt afraid to show it. Within minutes of the films somber opening we flash back to a younger Harvey (Sean Penn) naked in bed with his lover Scott Smith (James Franco) as the latter eats cake frosting off his nose. (Compare that with say the first five minutes of Gandhi.) At 40 tired of his semi-closeted life as an insurance executive in New York Harvey moves Scott to San Francisco where they open a camera store in the Castro (now a gay mecca then a mixed neighborhood of hippies and struggling merchants). No sooner has he arrived than the charismatic Harvey begins advocating for grass-roots causes. He organizes product boycotts and community groups but really what he wants is to be the first openly gay man on the Board of Supervisors a spot for which he will run cheerfully and unsuccessfully two times before finally prevailing in 1977. In recent years Sean Penn has been condensing into a black hole of an actor--his performances in Mystic River and All the Kings Men were so studiedly ""powerful"" that they swallowed up the surrounding movie. But his portrayal of Harvey Milk is restrained nuanced and most of all light--its nice to see Penn play a character of Spicoli-like sweetness and openness rather than the glowering lugs that have become his specialty. Thats not to say that Penns Harvey is an angel; his obsession with his own political career eventually drives away his beloved Scott and his next romance with a needy Mexican drama queen named Jack Lira (Diego Luna) is a study in passive-aggressive pathology. Luna is perfectly cast as are the other young members of Harveys admiring coterie an insular clan of activist foot soldiers that includes a startlingly transformed Emile Hirsch as hustler-turned-protege Cleve Jones. The scenes in which these cute boys huddle over electoral maps wildly strategizing about redistricting rules have a loose anarchic energy that feels like a real campaign in progress. Later the boys catty reception of Alison Pill as Harveys new campaign manager points to a not-so-distant time when gay men and lesbians saw their political interests as mutually exclusive. Josh Brolin has rocketed in one year to the top rank of American actors. He plays the granite-jawed secretly rageful possibly closeted Dan White with such compassion that its easy to forget hes the bad guy. In the movies heartbreaking last scene shots of the actors merge with real-life footage of a candlelight vigil on Castro Street the night of Milks death. Ending a biopic with archival footage was a concession to convention on Van Sants part but in the wake of Californias passing of Prop 8 (and the 30th anniversary of Milks death) this convergence of past and present feels more appropriate and sadder than ever.

"Milk | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; milk ) Milk (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli 30 years have passed since the assassination of San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and the ballot passage of Californias recent Proposition 8 notwithstanding advances have been made in the area of gay rights although there are still many hurdles left to be cleared. Gus Van Sant points his camera back to the 1970s to capture a small series of similarities to todays climate as filtered through huge refracted differences. By imbuing the characters with humanity and personality Van Sant avoids the obvious traps of making Milk a sycophantic tribute or a slickly made piece of propaganda. The story sticks as close to the facts as any bio-pic I can think of and Van Sant uses plenty of genuine 70s stock footage to amplify the period verisimilitude. As important as is Milks contribution to understanding the turbulent world of three decades past the film is equally notable for its ability to reflect how the fight for which Milk died still rages. Milk represents a ""hybrid"" film for Van Sant - a fusion of two phases of his career. In the late 1990s Van Sant had an extended flirtation with mainstream movie making (most notably Good Will Hunting) a period that had many wondering aloud whether he had ""sold out"" or ""cashed in."" In response to this he began a series of non-commercial deeply personal motion pictures culminating in last years Paranoid Park. With Milk Van Sant weds a straightforward linear narrative and high-profile cast with a subject matter that has genuine resonance for him. This is his most accessible film since 2000s Finding Forrester but it remains to be seen whether the viewing public is ready to accept a non-campy openly gay protagonist like Harvey Milk. Those who have grown up within the gay subculture or who have spent any significant time in San Francisco probably know who Harvey Milk is. For almost everyone else however he is at best an historical footnote and more likely an unknown. As depicted in the movie Milk (Sean Penn) and his lover Scott Smith (James Franco) depart New York for Frisco in 1972. They move to Castro Street and spend their pooled savings to open a camera store. Although the neighborhood is fast becoming a gay hangout many of the ""holdover"" businesses are hostile as are the police. The flamboyant Milk soon becomes an activist and attracts a small group of devoted followers including Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch) who would become one of Milks closest confidants. In 1977 following several unsuccessful runs for office Milk wins an election for Supervisor becoming the first openly gay man on an already liberal board. Milk soon becomes embroiled in a struggle against the so-called Proposition 6 - a referendum designed to allow school boards to fire gay teachers - and shows Americans there is nothing pernicious about being a homosexual. He wins the battle but is gunned down shortly thereafter at the age of 48. (Lest some consider this a spoiler even though it is a matter of the historical record Van Sant shows a newsclip of Diane Feinstein announcing the assassination early in the film.) While Milks fight was specifically for gay rights its easy to see him as a civil rights champion in a broader sense and this is the light in which Van Sant illuminates him. Even homophobes should be able to appreciate the importance of equal rights for any group regardless of race religion or sexual orientation. It is not unreasonable to surmise that at some point in the future current majorities could become minorities and at that point they will be grateful for the protections that Milk and others like him fought so long and hard for. As a result the struggle depicted in this movie takes on the more universal aspect of one man warring against a better funded intractable system. According to Van Sant the California vote with respect to Proposition 6 represented a cultural fork in the road for this country and Milk places its audience at ground zero. Milk is struggling against a tide of evangelical homophobia whipped up by pop-star-turned-activist Anita Bryant. The template of where such intolerance can lead - 1930s Germany - gives too few people pause. Milks tactic is simple humanize those the evangelicals would demonize. He asserts that two out of three who know a homosexual will not vote to have his/her rights stripped away. Sean Penn is a chameleon of an actor who shows uncommon discipline when it comes to choosing his roles although one would have to be naA-ve to assume that the potential of an Oscar nomination didnt enter his thinking when it came to accepting the part. Despite its low budget Milk is clearly being positioned as an Oscar contender - if not for Best Picture then at least for Best Actor. Sometimes so much prestige surrounding a performance can make it seem artificial or overhyped but to his credit Penn shrinks his ego and allows us to see only Harvey Milk. A more remarkable transformation however belongs to Josh Brolin who portrays Milks political opponent and fellow Supervisor Dan White. Brolin is getting a lot of kudos for his caricatured portrayal of George W. Bush in W.  but his work here is more complete. White is a divided tortured individual and Brolin shows us this more through expressions and mannerisms than by reciting Milks dialogue. Emile Hirsch who starred for Penn in Into the Wild co-stars with him here perhaps reflecting an off-screen mentor/protA(c)gA(c) relationship. Milk feels like an important picture but not in a way that makes it tedious to watch. Theres no pretentious sheen to the proceedings. In fact the essential story is comprised of basic elements the triumph of the underdog David vs. Goliath and the American tragedy of a strong voice silenced too soon. Knowing how the story ends merely emphasizes the importance of the steps taken to get to that point. Van Sant is cognizant of the films political applicability to current events but chose to release the film after Election Day rather than have it pigeonholed as propaganda whose entire purpose was to sway voters. For those who are not dissuaded by the homosexual subject matter (and it would be unrealistic to pretend that the films potential box office will not be depressed as a result of this) Milk represents a thought provoking cathartic and mostly true tale of politics and courage.

(Photo Credit Phil Bray) Joe Neumaier Tuesday November 25 2008 356 PM ""Milk.""  Biopic of slain gay politician Harvey Milk. With Sean Penn James Franco.  Director Gus Van Sant (208). R Sexuality language. At Village 7 Clearview Chelsea Lincoln Plaza. A successful biopic is a collection of standard notes punctuated hopefully with some poetry. ""Great man"" movies use a parade of events a setback or two and a look into the private life. ""Ahead of their time""tales require reversal then foresight. ""Unlikely hero""films need audiences to eventually see themselves in their subject. ""Milk"" about the last eight years in the life of Harvey Milk Americas first openly gay elected politician takes a bit from all of those traditions but is ultimately weaker for it.Though director Gus Van Sants movie boasts a strong lead performance from Sean Penn and perfect political timing following the controversy over the passing of Californias Proposition 8 the final result somehow undersells a man whose life and death were watershed moments in the gay rights movement. First seen in 1970 on the night before his 40th birthday Harvey Milk is a quick-to-smile insurance salesman from Long Island who worries that he has ""done nothing"" with his life. Soon he and his lover Scott (a calm and steadying James Franco) have relocated to San Francisco where they open a camera shop on Castro St. that becomes a neighborhood gathering spot and the launching point for Milks campaign to join the citys Board of Supervisors. Initially a well-meaning political newbie Milks third campaign finally lands him a spot in City Hall where his savvy and nonnegotiable goal to speak for the gay community earn respect. He becomes a vital part of the defeat of Prop 6 which would have made it illegal for gays to become teachers. Also on the board is Dan White (a spooky Josh Brolin) Milks cultural polar opposite and the man who would fatally shoot Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone in November 1978. On paper -- and as seen in 1984s Oscar-winning documentary ""The Times of Harvey Milk""-- the ascension of this particular man from self-appointed ""mayor of Castro St.""to a force unseen at that point even in San Francisco politics is inspiring and heartbreaking. The 30000 mourners at a candlight vigil following Milks murder is a moving final image. As a film though ""Milk""is too methodical. Harvey can work a crowd and put their feelings into words though those scenes are less than fiery feeling as sedate as other moments in Dustin Lance Blacks script Harvey cuts his hair to run for office; laughs off a death threat; talks his new boyfriend (a too-squeaky Diego Luna) down from a mood swing. Oddly if Van Sant had tapped into the sentimentality of his least characteristic film ""Good Will Hunting""""Milk""might match Penns sly performance. Slightly flamboyant a little reflective and very steely Penn throws himself in when the rest of the movie plays by the rules.

Milk (R) Focus (128 min.) Directed by Gus Van Sant. With Sean Penn Josh Brolin. Opens Wednesday at theaters in New York and the Ritz 16 in Voorhees. THREE AND A HALF STARS When he got involved in politics people told him he didnt have a chance. An activist and community organizer he lacked the legislative history long-time allies and establishment backing successful candidates needed. His speeches about ""hope"" were nice. But what he really needed to do was wait. But Harvey Milk was in a hurry. As the marvelous new biopic ""Milk"" shows he needed to be. In his own eyes the gay New Yorker had lived 40 years of his life in the closet and accomplished nothing. In his own heart he somehow suspected his life would be short. So he finally came out went West and reinvented himself. And along the way invented gay politics. Gays had already begun fighting back against police harassment most famously at the Stonewall Inn (a riot which began according to legend because the NYPD made the mistake of raiding it the week after Judy Garlands death). Yet even as straight women and minorities were running for office gays remained disenfranchised. Milk changed that in 1977 when he was finally elected city supervisor in San Francisco. Gus Van Sants ""Milk"" written by Dustin Lance Black -- and with a large acknowledged debt to the film ""The Times of Harvey Milk"" -- captures that era wonderfully. After years of deliberate obscurantism Van Sant is clear and in control of his material saluting this flamboyant hero without ever losing his own way in excess. Helping keep things focused is star Sean Penn. Penn is one of our great actors and his greatness comes from small things. Close your eyes and listen to how he absolutely gets -- but doesnt caricature -- Milks honking Long Island accent. Watch how he plays (but refuses to overplay) the mans flirtatious effeminacy -- the birdlike carriage of his head the feathery flutter of his gaze. This is predictably Oscar-bait but whats truly brave about it is that its not ballyhooed as an act of bravery. Penns performance is as matter-of-fact about the characters homosexuality as Milk hoped people would be about homosexuals; the love scenes all avoid the self-consciously ""daring"" feel they have in other films. The movie is good about showing some of Milks rough sides; it would have been even better if it had shown more. The supervisor -- like many pragmatic politicians -- accepted the help of cult leader Jim Jones when he needed it; he had a temper wasnt shy about ""outing"" people and was pretty good at playing hardball. He was no saint. That doesnt make him a devil either -- merely the realist he needed to be. Still Milks story is a truly American one of self-creation as he went from sailor to businessman to activist from ""discreet"" homosexual to flamboyant gay from mainstream Republican to liberal Democrat. More of that evolution -- and self-contradiction -- should be on view. What is on view though is a tremendous performance by Penn (and a very good one from Josh Brolin as his nemesis Supervisor Dan White as painfully self-imprisoned as Milk was gaily free). And whats striking about the movie is how much it is both of its time (platform shoes the ""clone"" look Sylvester) as it is of ours (anti-gay propositions identity politics the Christian Right.) There is one thing old-fashioned about this movie and its the same sad thing that haunts every movie about gays -- a tragic ending. What makes it acceptable though -- if truly heartbreaking -- is that for once the unhappy fadeout isnt the product of some hack screenwriter. Its the product of the times of Harvey Milk -- and sadly still our own. Ratings note The film contains brief nudity sexual situations substance abuse and strong language.

"Milk (R)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Milk (R)  Gay politicians San Francisco story still resonates 30 years later. In this image released by Focus Features Sean Penn is shown as Harvey Milk in a scene from ""Milk."" Photo AP/Focus Features. Share Print Save to your profile Rene Rodriguez Miami Herald San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk was the first openly gay politician elected to public office in the United States so its fitting that the long-in-the-works movie based on his life Milk has been directed by an openly gay filmmaker Gus Van Sant who doesnt spend much time wringing his hands about depicting homosexuality onscreen. Milk is all of five minutes old in fact before we see Sean Penn and James Franco locked in an open-mouth kiss that would make the boys from Brokeback Mountain blush. Van Sant purposely gets this stuff out of the way early because Milk isnt about being gay but about a mans political crusade to make sure being homosexual did not equate to being carted off in paddy wagons as we see in the newsreel snippets that open the movie. In his sunniest most charismatic performance in recent memory Penn plays Milk as an easygoing compassionate man who at the age of 40 moves to San Francisco in 1972 with his partner (Franco) and opens a camera shop in the citys Castro district. Soon hes greeted by a fellow business owner who tells him ``Theres mans law and theres Gods law in this neighborhood and the San Francisco Police Department are happy to enforce both. The script by Dustin Lance Black uses that incident as the impetus for Milks political career He was defeated three times before he earned a seat on the citys Board of Supervisors in 1977. The movie is framed by an audio recording Milk made on Nov. 18 1978 to be played on the event of his assassination (which came to pass only a few days later) in which he admits ``almost everything I did was with an eye on the gay movement. Milk and his growing nucleus of supporters (including Emile Hirsch as a brash street urchin and Alison Pill as one of the only people on his staff with actual campaign experience) are portrayed as an inseparably tight family driven not by the need to win necessarily but to get their message across and let the rest of the world know they were there. Van Sant pays careful attention to period detail (including one of the most impressive collection of sideburns ever gathered in a feature film) and historical accuracy (the movie makes copious use of archival footage) to show the cultural significance of Milks career and accomplishments. He has also set aside the near-experimental style of his previous few films (Paranoid Park Last Days) making this his most accessible picture since Finding Forrester. The directors compassion for his characters extends to not just Milk and his staff but also to their detractors including fellow city supervisor Dan White (Josh Brolin) whose career stumbles as Milks soars. White eventually worked out his frustrations in a tragically violent manner but Van Sant refuses to demonize him. That gives the films overriding message of acceptance and equality a lot more power illustrating how prejudice and intolerance can provide an outlet for people who otherwise dont know how to deal with their inner rage. As good as it is depicting his career Milk doesnt fare quite as well as a portrait of the man himself. Milks relationship with a flighty young Hispanic man (Diego Luna) makes little sense since you wonder how such an intelligent driven man could even tolerate such an annoying whiny partner. But Milk is an unapologetically political film and an uncommonly moving one at that especially considering the prominence gay issues had at the polls earlier this month. The more things change the more they stay the same.

Others will consider it in light of Proposition 8 the newly passed California ballot initiative that outlawed same-sex marriage. But this isnt a niche film -- no more than any movie set during the genesis of a civil rights movement is a niche film. Its message isnt limited to politics or social activism though they do eat up much of the plot. It is at its core an inspiring human story about an impish charismatic man who lived and loved and fought to do both out in the open. Watching Milk felt a bit for me like watching Titanic. History tells us the ship sank in the end. It also tells us that San Francisco city supervisor Harvey Milk the states first openly gay elected public official was assassinated along with Mayor George Moscone on Nov. 27 1978. Every inch of the plot is suffused with anticipated grief; with each passing year the milestone tolls like a bell. It wouldnt hurt if the actor playing him didnt disappear so completely into the role. As Milk Sean Penn turns in one of the toughest and most disarming performances of his career. He exhibits a transparency missing from his last go at a speechifying political role e_SEmD Willie Stark in 2006s gassy All the Kings Men -- and a playfulness that harks all the way back to Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Van Sant evoking the 1970s down to the last bell-bottom seems equally transformed. This marks his fifth straight feature to examine the dead or the dying but thats the only notable link between this movie and say the stylized ennui of Paranoid Park. Its as though hes emerged from a long meandering and intensely morbid daydream. Over the years hes alternated his smaller and stranger works with more conventional fare (Finding Forrester) but Im not sure Milk classifies as either. Theres a spring to its step a cinematic joi de vivre that suggests a viewpoint shockingly close to optimism -- and Penns scenes with James Franco as longtime love Scott Smith are as tender as anything Hollywood cranked out this year. And yet this is a film about an out-there homosexual activist and his band of varyingly flamboyant acolytes -- theres really no way around it. If this classes as a mainstream movie then the mainstream has come a long way. Milk opens on 1978 as the title activist -- hair matted yellow shirt loosened at the neck -- slumps over a tape recorder in his San Francisco apartment. ""This is only to be played in the event of my death by assassination"" he dictates with weariness and precision. ""If a bullet should enter my brain let it destroy every closet door."" Then we cut straight to news footage of the citys then-Board of Supervisors President Dianne Feinstein announcing that Milk and the mayor are dead. From that grim beginning Dustin Lance Blacks screenplay backs up eight years -- to a flirty pick-up on the New York subway platform where Harvey first meets Scott. They fall in love move to Frisco and open a camera shop on Castro Street where Milk founds a gay merchants association launches several runs for office and in 1977 finally wins. He leads the fight against Proposition 6 an effort to fire gay teachers at California public schools. At each bend he draws young gays into his orbit the geeky-cute hustler who went on to found the NAMES Project (a very sporting Emile Hirsch); the suffering teen who phones one night contemplating suicide. Somehow Milk implants hope in those whove lost it. Somehow Penn plays him as a feisty charmer so winning and lifelike that youll regard him as a friend before its over. And youll want to light a candle when he dies. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals GoPlus Racing Style Executive Chair for 80 + free shipping Open-Box Unlocked Galaxy S7 4G Android Phone for 420 + free...

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED November 25 2008 at 1137 am | UPDATED May 6 2016 at 1034 pm Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In Gus Van Sants masterful biopic ""Milk"" the American heroic is put on inspired humbling painful display. Sean Penn plays Harvey Milk who in 1977 became the nations first openly gay male elected official when he won a seat on San Franciscos Board of Supervisors. Tomorrow marks the 30th anniversary of Milks death. He and Mayor George Moscone were shot and killed in City Hall by another city supervisor Dan White played here by Josh Brolin. Written by Dustin Lance Black the film covers the eight years in which Milk went from insurance exec to hippie businessman to neighborhood organizer to a leader for gay civil rights. Along the way a portrait of a neighborhood a community and an era come alive. A great deal of the film unfolds in the camera shop Milk and his lover Scott Smith (James Franco) started in the neighborhood known as ""the Castro."" (Later Diego Luna plays boyfriend Jack Lira.) Castro Camera became a hub. It also served as Milks campaign headquarters. All the allies in Milks rise as a political figure congregate in the cramped space trading quips and devising strategy. Included in the circle of friends Frank Robinson Dick Pabich Jim Rivaldo Michael Wong and Cleve Jones (played with sweet zest by Emile Hirsch). Danny Nicoletta was the shops and the Castros visual chronicler. (His photos greatly influenced the productions period-perfect sets and costumes.) After years of campaigning and losing Milk hires Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) to manage his run for city supervisor. ""Milk"" manages something that often eludes biographical films about true-life heroes. It delivers a story both modest and epic. Harvey Milk was remarkable not by birth but in reaction to circumstances. ""Milk"" captures the convergence of a man a moment and a movement. Vant Sant and screenwriter Black dont use Milk and Moscones murders as a tease. The movie treats the deaths as public record. Real news footage shows Dianne Feinstein standing on the step of City Hall. In a wavering voice Feinstein (now a U.S. senator) tells those gathered that the men have been killed and the suspect is Dan White. The movie cuts to Milk sitting in a kitchen. On the table is a tape recorder. Hes dictating his last will and testament in case hes assassinated. Penns posture captures Milks resigned understanding of what might come and his grasp of its potential historical import. In a short few years he had come to represent something dangerous and threatening to some the unapologetic push by gays and lesbians to be full citizens. Throughout ""Milk"" Van Sant uses found footage from the period with elegant force. He weaves network news reports about Anita Bryants increasingly successful anti-gay campaigns. In 1978 inspired by Bryants successes and incensed by passage of protections in San Francisco state Sen. John Briggs introduced a ballot measure banning gay teachers from public schools. The battle over the Prop. 6 or ""the Briggs Initiative"" is at the political core of the story. At the heart of this eloquent portrait of a cultural catalyst is Penns profoundly human and possibly finest performance. He captures Milks animated physical presence. His eyes sparkle. He is goofy funny likely to burst into a smile. But when he crosses his arms he seems self-protective. Penn gives his character a complicated humility. In a late scene between Milk and Moscone (Victor Garber) he even gives off a whiff of hubris. Brolin plays straight-laced family man Dan White with just as much compassion. ""Milk"" makes it impossible to write off White as merely a hater. Early in the film Milk and Scott Smith meet cute in a subway station in New York City. But its not their first stolen kiss that defines the tremendous spirit of ""Milk."" Instead it is the sight of Milk and Smith outside their newly opened storefront business. Smith sits on a ledge. Milk has knelt before him. They kiss. Behind them in the window of Castro Camera is a sign. ""Yes Were Open"" it declares. ""Milk"" R for language some sexual content and brief violence. 2 hour 8 minutes.

Focus Features In Focus The Moscone-Milk Anniversary -- And Legacy Nov. 26 2008 Gotta Give Em Hope The Legacy Of Harvey Milk Nov. 11 2008 The first onscreen images are eerie reminders of the time in which Harvey Milk came of age black-and-white footage of young men being quietly led from gay bars to police vans. They are not resisting. Its the 1960s and the men are docile hiding their faces clearly ashamed. In the 70s Milk was not ashamed. And as played by Sean Penn once he makes it to City Hall he doesnt want his staff to be ashamed either. ""Any time you come here"" he tells a supporter on his first day in office ""I want you to wear the tightest jeans possible. Never blend in."" Milks unlikely story -- the tale of how a transplanted New Yorker in San Francisco built an unlikely coalition with the Teamsters united a largely apolitical gay community and rode into public office on the issue of cleaning up dog poop -- fills Gus Van Sants briskly entertaining film with plenty of incident. Also with colorful characters Emile Hirsch flirting madly as street punk-turned-community organizer Cleve Jones; James Franco and Diego Luna as Milks wildly different lovers; Josh Brolin as his fellow city supervisor Dan White whod be a political antagonist and eventually Milks assassin. White was a family-values conservative -- a likely opponent once Milk introduced a citywide gay-rights bill just like the one that homophobic singer Anita Bryant had crusaded successfully against in Florida. What sets this film entertainingly apart from most civil rights sagas though are a slew of relaxed offhandedly persuasive performances along with the flamboyance of hippie-era San Francisco. And of course theres Penn whos so engaging physically loose and just plain smart in the title role hes bound to top everyones shortlist come awards time. Brolin who has far fewer scenes in which to morph from family man to monster is also terrific. And he makes a nicely ambiguous case for the screenplays most arresting notion that Milk could have regarded his killer as a kind of kindred spirit who might himself have one foot in the closet. Director Gus Van Sant builds his era-evoking story around some enormous screen-filling set pieces by mixing 70s news footage with freshly shot sequences. He re-creates political rallies -- the fight against an anti-gay ballot proposition that feels all-too-familiar this year -- and of course the gunshots that ended the lives of Milk and Mayor George Moscone 30 years ago. The killings are treated in the film as a literally operatic climax but Van Sant doesnt end the story with them. Instead he provides a rending bookend to those first black-and-white shots of embarrassed men being rounded up by the police. This time the news footage is in color and the police are on the sidelines. And the thousands marching with candles are sadly -- but proudly -- honoring one of their own.

But Peter Ricketts chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee in 2001 said the Blair government was aware that there were voices in the U.S. calling for regime change.After the Sept. 11 attacks there was a different ""tone"" in Washington Ricketts said. Asked if Britain would have supported the effort to overthrow Saddam if the Sept. 11 attacks had not occurred Ricketts said ""Im pretty sure ... we would have remained convinced that a strengthened sanctions regime tightened narrowed was the right way to go and we would have continued to push to get weapons inspectors back in.""-- Janet Stobart Tribune NewspapersFestival of mass animal sacrifice beginsBARIYAPUR Nepal -- Butchers hoist swords Tuesday during a two-day ritual slaughter of more than 200000 buffaloes goats and chickens part of a blood-soaked festival held every five years to honor Gadhimai a Hindu goddess of power.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Harvey Milk the first openly gay American voted into major public office liked to joke that hed never make it to 50. And of course he was right. A transplanted New Yorker elected to San Franciscos Board of Supervisors in 1977 Milk had one year in office before he and Mayor George Moscone were murdered by supervisor Dan White a Vietnam vet ex-cop and firefighter who felt that the city was being forcibly taken away from traditional families like his. Despite the foregone nature of the story Sean Penn and director Gus Van Sant have created a suspenseful moving and absorbing biography in ""Milk."" The film is a passionate history lesson a broadside in favor of gay rights and the engaging story of one flawed but courageous man. Its framing device shows Milk dictating his will into a tape recorder and reminiscing about his turbulent life. To say that it was a mixture of triumph and tragedy sounds trite but its accurate. Milk was insecure about his attractiveness and age and repeatedly chose unstable partners. He nearly lost three lovers to suicide and in the film he ascribes their attempts to prejudice and social ostracism. To help us recall the attitudes of those times Van Sant opens the film with newsreel footage of frightened humiliated men being handcuffed in police raids on gay bars. Milks ceaseless work to bring gay citizens out of the closet and to organize them to vote recruit political allies and stand up for their rights created a lasting legacy of social change. When confused and isolated young gay men contacted the famous politician for advice he acted as a sensitive mentor. His interactions with those troubled souls put the lie to the icebreaker joke he used whenever he addressed a suspicious crowd ""Hello Im Harvey Milk and Im here to recruit you."" San Francisco was a magnet for disenfranchised gays and Milk was the first to successfully rally that political power base. Screenwriter Dustin Lance Black shows the painstaking process of building coalitions pressing on despite losing election after election and fashioning popular proposals that have nothing to do with your highest agenda. Penn cements his reputation as one of Americas great actors in the title role. He offers a breathtaking performance that is historically accurate and psychologically probing. We meet Milk on the eve of his 40th birthday a closeted nebbish without a single accomplishment hes proud of. Penn gives Milk winsome charm and self-deprecating humor crinkling his face into an expression that is 90 percent grin 10 percent wince. The film follows his slow climb from local politics to national fame a climb that earned him many enemies and anonymous death threats. As politics became his passion he also lost his strong stable lover Scott Smith (James Franco) and took on damaged immigrant Jack Lira (Diego Luna) with disastrous results. Milks finest hour comes as he debates state Sen. John Briggs over a 1978 ballot initiative to fire gay and lesbian teachers from Californias public schools. ""If it were true that children mimic their teachers"" Milk quips ""wed have a hell of a lot more nuns running around."" MILK  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for language some sexual content and brief violence. Where Uptown. Three weeks after the Briggs initiative was voted down White who had recently resigned from the Board of Supervisors and unsuccessfully appealed to the mayor for reappointment to his seat climbed through a City Hall basement window and fatally shot Moscone and Milk. White served five years for voluntary manslaughter based on diminished capacity (the contention that his junk food diet was a contributing factor became known as ""the Twinkie defense""). Van Sant who can be almost impenetrably artsy operates in naturalistic mode here. He painstakingly re-creates seedy late-1970s San Francisco from the candlelight mass marches down to the unfortunate hairstyles and appalling eyeglasses. And he draws commendable work from his actors; Milks clique of political supporters are nicely individualized despite limited screen time. Josh Brolin plays White as a man incapable of evolving in changing times threatened by his rivals success and a rising tide of acceptance for homosexuals. Brolin carries himself like a drunk with a stomachache which seems exactly right. The films only serious stumble is the implication that White also was motivated by a repressed sexual attraction toward his political nemesis Milk a notion that feels implausible and dramatically unnecessary. That misstep aside ""Milk"" is a compelling portrait of a man a place and an era that remain relevant and controversial today.

Running for the board of supervisors (the equivalent of the city council) the Long Island-born Milk cultivated a respectable slightly stuffy look and demeanor -- the three-piece suits the shock of hair he wore like a mildly rebellious English professor -- that worked as a strategy He wasnt about to let anyone peg him as some hippie-homosexual degenerate (at least not by 1977 when he had already lost three elections). But Milks squareness was more than a mask. It said Here at long last is a gay politician whos out of the closet yet knows how to work the system. What Milks ebullient smile beamed to the world was how good it felt for an activist to lay his hands on power. In Milk Gus Van Sants incisive and stirring dramatization of Harvey Milks heroic life and violent death Sean Penn inhabits those suits with a slightly awkward body language -- a nerds stiffness -- that is touching to behold because its so jarringly expressive. When Milk stands before a crowd of demonstrators and waves his arms out of some combination of wanting to inspire and not knowing where to put those arms when he speaks hes a true man of the people a noble schmo thrust into history because he realizes that if he doesnt lead no one else will. Penn does an imitation of Milks Lawn Guyland Jewish whine thats a bit more fey than that of the actual public Harvey Milk. But the theatricality of Penns acting works as a brilliant projection of Milks playful intellectual spirit -- his fighters joy. Milk is a fascinating film -- more docudrama than biopic -- because as staged by Van Sant from Dustin Lance Blacks deft screenplay it immerses us in the political process. Milk a Bay Area camera-store proprietor doesnt choose politics; it chooses him when he sees that even in San Francisco gays are treated like third-class citizens. Once he gets elected supervisor the movie is devoted to his attempt to defeat Proposition 6 a statewide measure to ban gay teachers that Milk seizes on as a key issue of civil freedom. With Miss America runner-up?turned?antigay crusader Anita Bryant as his foil of intolerance Milk isnt just fighting for ""rights."" Hes leading a cultural crusade. The movie shows you what a shrewd politico he is (he uses beer boycotts dog-poop laws anything that works) and its creepy to see him forge a rickety alliance with Dan White (Josh Brolin) the conservative Catholic supervisor who like Milk gets elected thanks to a new district-divided voter map. Brolin makes White a dim politician and hooded soul in a world changing too fast for him to handle. As a study of a political moment Milk is memorable. As a story of Milks personal life however it leaves something to be desired. James Franco is sharp as the boyfriend who ditches him but from the moment Diego Luna shows up in the underwritten role of Milks flakiest lover you feel that the film is leaving out as much as it shows. But thats a forgivable flaw in the rare liberal message-movie manifesto that lingers in the mind as well as the heart. A?

That the film about Harvey Milk the first openly gay man elected to public office is good is not one of them. The story is compelling. Milk who lost a string of elections was assassinated 11 months after finally being elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. And with Gus Van Sant as director the tale is in good hands. Nor is it surprising that Sean Penn is incredible in the title role. Van Sant has said he didnt direct Penn so much as just stay out of his way. Penn inhabits the character completely pulling off a tricky role. You dont want to hide Milks gayness but being out in San Francisco in the mid-1970s was a different experience - shorts were shorter expressions more flamboyant. Penn captures that perfectly without delving into parody. And he gets at the joy in Milks life too. Thats one of the surprises That Milk whose life was touched by failure loss and tragedy remained so optimistic not just about himself and his public life but about the future of gay and civil rights as well. His enthusiasm makes his death - he was killed by fellow supervisor Dan White - all the more poignant. Another surprise For a film set in the 1970s Milk feels remarkably contemporary. His fight to defeat Proposition 6 which would have forced school districts to fire gay teachers and their supporters is central to the film. It echoes the recent divisions over Proposition 102 in Arizona and Proposition 8 in California which seek to define marriage. The film begins with Milk in New York nearing middle age and feeling empty about his life. Along with lover Scott Smith (James Franco) he moves to San Francisco. They open a camera shop in the Castro district where they are shunned by other business owners because of their sexual orientation. Milk organizes other gay businesses; soon the camera shop doubles as a campaign headquarters. Its fascinating to watch Milk go from a political novice to someone who not only works within the machine but also enjoys being a part of it. Finally Milk is elected along with White (Josh Brolin). At first uneasy allies they become enemies. When White resigns but then changes his mind Milk wont go along sending the already troubled White into a tailspin. Van Sant doesnt go the easy route by making White a cardboard-cutout villain. (The words ""Twinkie defense"" - Whites explanation for why he killed Milk and Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber) included the claim that he was addled from eating too much junk food - appear only in an epilogue.) Instead White is shown to be a complex man torn by conflict who struggles to fit in as much as Milk does. Brolin is excellent capturing Whites personal and political frustrations which grow as Milks power does. After fighting his identity for so long Milk finally having found purpose and an expression for it is comfortable in his skin. White is not and that discomfort only increases. Penn is astounding. Milk was no saint and Penn doesnt try to make him so. But he was courageous and inspiring and both Penn and Van Sant get that across. Although Milk tells an ultimately tragic story it is - another surprise - also entertaining for a ""statement"" film. With the combination of Van Sants direction and Penns masterful performance its moving and important as well. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8974.

Our story. 1 / 11 Back to Gallery Milk Drama. Starring Sean Penn James Franco and Josh Brolin. Directed by Gus Van Sant. (R. 128 minutes. Opens today at the Castro Friday at the Embarcadero and Sundance Kabuki and Dec. 5 at Bay Area theaters.) With ""Milk"" a great San Francisco story becomes a great American story. Director Gus Van Sant uses the account of one of the countrys first openly gay public officials who was assassinated in 1978 to invest the gay rights movement with mythic grandeur as a successor to all the heroic social protest movements in American history. Van Sants point of view may be a matter of politics outside the scope of a review but his success in putting over his point of view is a question of art. His success is complete. His shaping of the material is seamless and the images he evokes are inspiring. At the center of everything is Sean Penn who disappears into the title role. Gone are his familiar facial expressions. Gone are the pursed lips and the covered compressed quality. He has Harvey Milks hair and from some angles - particularly when Milk is in the public arena - the physical resemblance is uncanny. But whats more striking is the spiritual transformation. Penn gives us a man who was once closeted and now as if in response lives his life completely in the open. Hes spontaneous as Penn has never been spontaneous. Hes emotional vulnerable and generous with his laughter. Penn plays him as an utterly liberated man and this liberates Penn as an actor. Milks openness which makes him an endearing figure gives the movie latitude to paint a complex portrait without losing the audiences interest or affection. The Milk who emerges is at times vain and frivolous. His personal life is often messy and sometimes downright farcical and his Machiavellian streak isnt becoming even if impressive. Hes no saint but he has courage and self-knowledge and you get the feeling that both qualities were hard earned. Van Sants Milk is essentially an average man who gets the call. By chance by accident of history by some strange meeting of disposition and location Harvey Milk in the 1970s finds himself to be the one person best suited to lead the gay rights movement. The movie begins with him in 1978 making a tape recording to be played in the event of his assassination. We then flash back to 1970 when Milk at 40 years old decides to throw off his closeted life and move from New York to San Francisco with his new lover Scott Smith (James Franco). Van Sant mixes archival footage with new footage - at times its impossible to tell one from the other - and its fascinating to see San Francisco in the 70s. Theres color and beauty but also coarseness; excitement and hope but with a feeling that something - or everything - just might spin out of control. The depiction looks accurate but maybe it looks that way only to people like me who never saw San Francisco in that era. No matter. Van Sant captures something either the city as it was or the San Francisco of legend. By the time he arrives in San Francisco Milk looks like a hippie but hes an old hippie with non-hippie talents such as a gift for organization and a head for business. He buys a camera shop and soon his store becomes a community hangout. Before anyone else does Milk realizes the potential clout of the gay community. He becomes the guy people go to when they get beaten up by the police. He becomes the guy the Teamsters talk to when they want the gay community on their side. A generation ago it apparently wasnt that easy being gay in San Francisco but Milk realizes the way out of the darkness He understands that mainstream acceptance will come not through hiding and assimilation but through people being openly and unapologetically themselves. ""Milk"" contains a second remarkable performance (unless you also count James Francos for looking totally OK about having Sean Penn kissing him like he means it). As Supervisor Dan White who ultimately murdered Milk and Mayor George Moscone Josh Brolin presents a chilling study in weakness. Whites intelligence is limited. His self-conception is rigid and inaccurate. His anger is unspecific but towering and he might be gay though his homosexuality could be hidden even from himself. Brolin lets us see Whites thought processes which are slow and easily derailed by self-protective anger. Last month Brolin played George W. Bush in ""W."" This week hes Dan White. He must wonder sometimes what casting directors are reading into him. Van Sants goal in ""Milk"" is to give the gay rights movement the grandness and impact of the civil rights movement. To do that Milk must be made into the gay equivalent of Martin Luther King Jr. who led a moral crusade fully knowing that he might be murdered along the way. In truth the King comparison only goes so far. Yes Milk led a crusade that involved physical risk and the real Harvey Milk did make tapes (in 1977) to be played in the event of his assassination. But it would be stretching things to say Milk was killed because he was gay. His death was more like a fluke part of a macabre workplace crime that also robbed the city of its mayor. Its evidence of the films effectiveness its power to incite emotion that Milks death is made to feel like the inevitable consequence of his being a visionary. One truth ""Milk"" doesnt need to amplify or manipulate Its that Harvey Milks story is part of the San Francisco story and that story still means something even to those who came to town years later and never heard of Milk until they got here.

By David Denby Sean Penn as Harvey Milk in Gus Van Sants movie about the life and death of the gay-rights activist and politician.   Credit Illustration by Robert Risko At the beginning of Gus Van Sants vibrantly entertaining bio-pic ""Milk"" Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) picks up a much younger man in the New York subway. Physically the two are far from equals Penns Milk is forty and short with a big schnoz and matted wedges of hair heading uneasily in different directions; Scott Smith played by James Franco is tall and slender with an angel face and a curly brown mane. But Smith is charmed by Milks self-deprecating humor and turned on by his ravenous need. Sighing Smith gives in and goes home with him. It is the first of Harvey Milks triumphs that we see. With Smith in tow he moves to San Francisco in 1972 and sets up a camera shop in the Castro district. He becomes locally famous as a gay activist and unofficial neighborhood fixer. He trades favors with the Teamsters arranging a boycott of Coors beer in gay bars when the brewery wont sign a contract with the union; in return the Teamsters allow openly gay men to drive beer-delivery trucks. In 1977 on his third try Milk is elected as a district supervisor (the equivalent of a city councilman in New York). He is at the height of his influence and possibly bound for the mayoralty. But in 1978 along with Mayor George Moscone he is shot and killed by a fellow-supervisor the family-values conservative Dan White (Josh Brolin). In making this movie Van Sant is forced to wrestle with the assorted pieties built into three high-minded genres not just the bio-pic but also the fallen-martyr saga and the social-protest statement. Working with the screenwriter Dustin Lance Black he includes archival footage from the nineteen-fifties and sixties of gays being arrested in bars and pushed into police vans. He uses news footage of Dianne Feinstein (then the head of the Board of Supervisors) announcing the murders. He devotes serious time to speeches and campaign strategizing. Van Sant wants to tell the political story accurately and in detail but ""Milk"" is anything but starchy. The righteous march of events is warmed by the banter the casual sex and the candor of the gay milieu of the giddy seventies the period just before AIDS when life was free and easy. Some sort of sexual mischief is almost always playing out around the edges of the action and at the center of the picture Milk comes across as an idiosyncratic man a rule-bound New York Jew who finds his calling in the beautiful and sensually relaxed Mediterranean-style city. The gay leader becomes a superb pol with a human-rights agenda and the movie offers a mildly subversive suggestion attracting the electorate is not all that different from picking up a young man in the subway. Charm persistence and articulate passion are required for both. Harvey Bernard Milk the son of Bill and Minnie Milk was born on Long Island in Woodmere in 1930. After graduating from SUNY Albany he joined the Navy became a chief petty officer during the Korean War and then took up the life of a cultivated closeted gay man in New York City. He worked as a research analyst at Bache amp; Co. lived on Central Park West and went to the opera; he carried on a series of monogamous affairs with men. His early life is no more than hinted at in the movie but his conservative background--he even supported Goldwater in 1964--is an essential part of his fascination as a character. This man was not by nature a troublemaker. Sidling into a room with a deferential smile and speaking in a soft slightly nasal Long Island accent Penn portrays Milk as a little shy at first. As an openly gay politician he is eager to please and to reassure. ""I left my high heels at home"" he tells a roomful of barrel-chested union men. Much of the time Penn keeps his voice down but the fervor and the humor are there in the most offhand moments. Without ostentation he creates a new body a new temperament he loosens up his neck and shoulders and swivels his head; his smile becomes enormous and all-embracing; he holds an elbow out and pumps a forearm up and down like a semaphore as Milk speaks in public. Habits of boldness come upon Milk gradually and then in a rush of joy defiantly. ""My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you"" becomes his declamatory signature line. Is there an actor in Hollywood braver than Sean Penn? In the recent past he has taken on parts so difficult that they bordered on the unplayable--the autistic man trying to hold on to his child in ""I Am Sam"" (2001) the enraged ex-con and avenging father in ""Mystic River"" (2003) the dying college professor in ""21 Grams"" (2003) the fantasy-driven loser in ""The Assassination of Richard Nixon"" (2004). After all these surly vicious and damaged men it is startling to see Penn for the first time in years playing a man who is happy--or at least happy in his public role. (His private life is a mess.) But happiness it turns out is the center of Milks agenda. He wants what straights take for granted the ability to live without shame. By casting a famously macho actor as Harvey Milk Van Sant has made the central humanist desire for self-acceptance and pride newly powerful. Giving himself utterly to the role Penn takes an actors craft and dedication to soulful heights making a demand for dignity that becomes universal. Long ago in 1991 before Van Sant directed such mainstream films as ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""To Die For"" he made a different kind of gay movie--""My Own Private Idaho"" with two young hustlers (Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix) wandering the West and noodling among the tenderloin drifters in downtown Portland. Almost abstract in its use of clouds mountains and vast open spaces ""Idaho"" was a dreamy vague picture; River Phoenixs character Mike was a narcoleptic and having sex with someone was about the only way he could stay awake. In ""Milk"" no one ever seems to sleep. Milk picks up some lost boys similar to Mike--Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch) a smart little street operator from Phoenix and Jack Lira (Diego Luna) an emotionally unstable Latino who becomes Milks lover after Scott Smith grows tired of the endless campaigning and walks out. But Van Sant sticking to the main story line maintains an upbeat tempo and a purposeful mood. Milk rouses a ragtag army of street boys and Harvard graduates--and a tough woman Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) who manages them all. With this band of irregulars he fights against the religious pop singer Anita Bryant who is going around the country with God and family in her back pocket calling for the reversal of gay-rights laws; and the grim California state senator John Briggs (Denis OHare) who sponsors a referendum--the notorious Proposition 6--to throw Californias gay teachers and their supporters out of work. ""Milk"" is a rowdy anthem of triumph brought to an abrupt halt by Milks personal tragedies and the unfathomable moral chaos of Dan White. Van Sant and Black are careful not to caricature the assassin. In another brilliant performance Josh Brolin a slab of hair lying low across his forehead gives White a brick-headed baffled manner a tormented neediness. Milk humors White but grimaces in distaste when hes not looking. He persuades himself that the handsome former cop and fireman is merely ""uneducated"" and can be turned into an ally but White senses his condescension and is hurt by it. Astonishingly he wants to be liked by Milk; in a party scene drunk he moves in close to him. In the filmmakers interpretation theres a suggestion of repressed homosexuality in Dan White which is a familiar liberal explanation of why seemingly straight men murder gays. Well never know and in any case Whites other victim Mayor Moscone was not gay. After serving only five years in prison White was released and less than two years later committed suicide. Harvey Milk laid many myths and fears to rest but there are some demons that in one form or another keep on destroying. Isabella Swan (Kristen Stewart) a lovely self-possessed high-school junior moves to a new school in Washington State and sees in the cafeteria a tall inordinately pale boy Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) glowering at her. He wants her but he cannot give way to desire. Edward it turns out is a morally serious vampire thirsty yet ascetic and Isabella falls in love with him. ""Twilight"" the first movie adapted from Stephenie Meyers series of best-selling teen novels is going to be a big hit with young girls and deservedly so--the picture delivers. Edward and his ghoulish family consider themselves ""vegetarians"" they have vowed to drink only the blood of animals even though human blood gives them greater satisfaction. They live in a constant state of virtuous denial. In some ways the scrupulous Edward is an ideal lover after all many teen-age girls dont want intercourse; they want romance and here is a boy with superhuman powers who is nevertheless real sweet with his girl and protects her from harm without demanding anything but the chance to adore her. The director Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"") oversees some special effects that look a little cheesy though the sunless Northwest thick with mountain forests is gloomily magnificent. Much of the time Hardwicke keeps the camera close to the chaste lovers. A genuine love story might be difficult for a young audience to handle but this fantasy is blissful madness--an abstinence fable sexier than sex.

Plus the cheesy allure of Twilight. By David Edelstein Published Nov 23 2008 ShareThis (Photo Phil Bray/Courtesy of Focus Features) While not up there in the annals of transformation with Robert De Niros poundage or Daniel Day-Lewiss palsy Sean Penns smile lines in Milk are a wonder. Theyre not crinkles theyre furrows; they seem to stretch all the way down to his soul. As the gay activist Harvey Milk who was shot to death in 1978 along with the San Francisco mayor George Moscone the volatile Penn is unprecedentedly giddy. Theres anger in his Milk but it never festersits instantly channeled into political action. In the tedious remake of All the Kings Men Penn went in for Method-y pauses in the scenes of Willie Stark finding his soapbox voice He seemed too inward an actor to play a natural rabble-rouser. But as Milk he shakes off Method self-attention the way Milk shook off the shame of being gay. As the personal becomes political he opens all the windows and gets visibly high on the breeze. Milk is a hagiography but theres nothing wrong with that if you believe as director Gus Van Sant and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black obviously do in the gospel of Harvey Milk. And queer hagiography is bracingly different from that other kind in that its often so to speak ass-backward the road to rebirth leading through the flesh instead of around it. There arent many life stories of saints in which the heros salvation begins with picking up a studly young Midwesterner in a New York City subway station on the eve of said heros 40th birthday. After their happy sex Milk lies beside Scott Smith (James Franco) and muses on the closeted life he has lived until then. So he sets off with his new lover for San Franciscos Castro neighborhood for a life to be lived aboveground in the light. Gay writer Black grew up in a military home (whammy) that also happened to be Mormon (double whammy) and he has written episodes of HBOs dizzying Big Love. His view of the Castro of the early seventies as a sexual Eden is heady unsullied by post-AIDS hindsight and Van Sant and cinematographer Harris Savides have an easy touch. There are no hallowed clinches a la Brokeback Mountain; every gay smooch doesnt carry the weight of the world. In the flush of all the new arrivals the Castro is a burgeoning gay ecosystem; Milk who has opened a camera store fortifies its roots by singling out businesses for boycott that arent homo-friendly then sets out to become the first openly gay elected officeholder in San Francisco. Lovers drift in and out but Black and Van Sant ease them to the edge of the frame; were not entirely sure why Milk and Smith break off or how Milk could possibly take in a Mexican lover (Diego Luna) who is so egregiously epically crazy. The filmmakers dont pry possibly because so many people in Milks orbit are still around (and on the set) but more likely because they mean for Milk to be so psychologically upbeatto inspire future activists. Thats laudable especially now with the passage of Proposition 8 in Milks old stomping grounds. But it doesnt make for great drama. The threats are largely from the outside from Anita Bryant and of course Milks murderer uptight fellow supervisor Dan White (Josh Brolin with a bowl haircut). Milk refers to him as a closet case but its unclear what White is except confused (then violent) but Brolin is always busy playing something. Hes the only actor with a meaty subtext. Good as Penn is its too bad he didnt have a chance to show us Milk before his emergencenot for the same old coming-out-of-the-closet story but because the Before picture (Milk among the straights) would give the After more weight. Milk is one of the most heartfelt portraits of a politician ever madethe man himself remains just out of reach. Its no mystery why Stephenie Meyers romantic vampire saga Twilight gets under the skin of so many young readersand why the movie although nowhere near as penetrating will be the occasion for mass public swoon-a-thons. Its the biochemistry angle. See the gorgeous vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) is driven mad with desire by the high-school heroine Isabellas scent. He smells her and his eyes become a feral yellow-black; and she loves him hungrily too in her ordinary teenage raging hormonal way. But in the vampire universe appetites cant be controlled. One taste of her blood could trigger carnage on an operatic scale. Meyers prose is skimmable but her dialogue hits all the right beats; experiencing these two beautiful creatures enforced sexual suppression on the page made me feel like I was 17 again. The movie though is cautious and rather wan a sort of Tiger Beatified Twin Peaks. But a lot of people have so much invested that theyll love it anyway. At the screening I went to three rows of girls shrieked at the entrance of Pattinson and shrieked again when he locked eyes with Bella (Kristen Stewart). Hes more my idea of a hunky Frankenstein than a hunky vampire with six inches of hair above six inches of forehead above a foot of face in too-obvious white greasepaint. But when he rolls his eyeballs up and stares down at Stewart trying to convey the hopelessness of their situation his dippy sincerity is touching. 1 2 Next Share this story...

After five years spent working on the more experimental fringe Gus Van Sant fluently returns to the relative mainstream with ""Milk"" an adroitly and tenderly observed account of the life of Harvey Milk the first openly gay man voted into significant U.S. public office. Smartly handled study of the San Francisco politicians powerful effect on individuals and society accurately catches a moment in American political life three decades ago but is most notable for the surprising and entirely winning performance by Sean Penn in the leading role. Almost the definition of a specialized audience film this Focus release looks to perform strongly in urban and university-adjacent areas but will have trouble crossing over to a public not into gay political and social-vanguard issues. Commentators will not fail to note certain parallels with the current political season encapsulated by its heros parting line ""You gotta give em hope."" Van Sant has always gravitated toward transgressive outcast characters and none of them traveled so far from the margins into the status quo or had such convulsive impact as the real-life Harvey Milk a New Yorker who at 40 moved to San Francisco and broke down a significant sociopolitical barrier before being assassinated by a disturbed fellow politician. The normalizing demands of the biopic genre necessarily squeeze the director into a more recognizable format than he has employed since at least ""Finding Forrester"" eight years ago and its possible that the most ardent fans of his variously beautiful and aggravating subsequent works -- ""Gerry"" ""Elephant"" ""Last Days"" and ""Paranoid Park"" -- will find this one too conventional. But while ""Milk"" is unquestionably marked by many mandatory scenes -- the electioneering outrage at conservative opposition tension between domestic and public life insider politicking public demonstrations et al. -- the quality of the writing acting and directing generally invests them with the feel of real life and credible personal interchange rather than of scripted stops along the way from aspiration to triumph to tragedy. And on a project whose greatest danger lay in its potential to come across as agenda-driven agitprop the filmmakers have crucially infused the story with qualities in very short supply today -- gentleness and a humane embrace of all its characters even of the entirely vilifiable gunman Dan White. Enormously researched script by Dustin Lance Black (""Big Love"" the indie feature ""Pedro"") begins in November 1978 with Milk presciently tape-recording some personal reflections driven by the awareness that he could easily become the victim of a political assassination which he in fact was later that month. ""Almost everything I did was with an eye on the gay movement"" he admits and so it is when in jumping back to 1972 Harvey moves with b.f. Scott Smith (a frizzy-haired sweet-smiling James Franco) from Gotham to Baghdad by the Bay determined to do something meaningful with his hitherto uneventful life. The opening stretch fleetly documents the role Harvey and a small group of gay buds who hung out at Harveys Castro Camera shop played in transforming the Castro district from an unremarkable working-class neighborhood into the gay Mecca it shortly became. The banter flies easily among these bright young men who form the nucleus of Harveys activist political organization when he runs for office and loses three times twice for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and once for California State Assembly. Warm but boldly assertive at all times Harvey builds a strong support system in the Castro becomes allied with new S.F. Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber) and against the backdrop of propagandist singer Anita Bryants campaigns to repeal gay rights in Florida and elsewhere takes advantage of new city redistricting to finally win a seat on the Board of Supervisors in 1977. At this point and beyond especially during the fight against the attempt by California State Senator John Briggs (Denis OHare) to ban gays from teaching in public schools the film does become overweighted by real and re-created TV reports and docu-like material (actual homemovies and vintage reportage are fluidly mixed with newly shot footage throughout) and rooted in specific issues at the expense of the personal. In fact the pics least satisfactory interludes are devoted to Harveys last important lover Jack Lira (Diego Luna) a footloose young Mexican who never comfortably coexists with the long-established inner circle. One can surmise there was a strong sexual bond that kept them together but as Jack increasingly complains about his partners busy schedule he quickly becomes an annoying character the only person who creates a drag on Harveys energy and focus. More insight into this needy immature fellow would have helped. By contrast another street kid picked up by Harvey the amusingly brash Cleve Jones (Emile Hirsch) proves a constantly vibrant presence as he evolves into a crucial ally and movement leader. The lone woman of consequence ""tough dyke"" Anne Kronenberg (Alison Pill) comes aboard to run the successful fourth campaign while resistance to Harveys upfront style is unexpectedly provided by the Advocate publisher David Goodstein (Zvi Howard Rosenman). But the most surprising and suggestively inflected exchanges occur between Harvey and his eventual killer. The city supervisor from a traditional working class district clean-cut jock Dan White (Josh Brolin) seems distinctly uncomfortable around Harvey; his knee-jerk impulse is to coldly rebuff him and he believes his Catholicism and the disposition of his constituents requires him to counteract Harveys gay agenda. But he is at other times remarkably solicitous inviting only Harvey among all the other supervisors to his sons christening and indulging in political horsetrading with his erstwhile opponent (""I think he may be one of us"" Harvey winks to one of his cronies). The pic reveals Harveys own unwittingly fateful betrayals of Dan. But arguably the films best scene is between Harvey and Dan in an otherwise empty foyer; an inarticulate plea for understanding in the form of a drunken rant by Dan the exchange oozes a complicit vibe between the two men all but confirming Harveys earlier suspicions. Brolins work is superlatively expressive of the inchoate impulses roiling inside his sorry character. But good as most of the cast is the show belongs squarely to Penn. Made to more closely resemble Milk via an elongated nose which also makes his face look narrower the actor socks over his characterization of a man hes made to seem above all a really sweet guy but who crucially possessed the fearlessness and toughness to be a highly successful political motivator agitator and ultimately figurehead of a movement. Penns Harvey is a man with a ready laugh alive to the moment open to life regardless of neuroses and past tragedies and acutely aware of ones limited time on Earth. The explosive anger and fury often summoned by Penn in his work is nowhere to be seen replaced by a geniality that is as welcome as it is unexpected. Penn is also an ideal conduit for a characteristic shrewdly underlined in Blacks writing that being Harveys talent for gently but firmly nudging people out of routine or complacent attitudes. Harvey knows how to tweak others with lightly provocative or stimulating comments that break the ice and Penn lays on just the right amount of casual innuendo to make this crucial personality trait convincing. Re-dressed to assume its more humdrum look of 30-plus years ago the Castro represents itself with absolute authenticity; even Castro Camera has been re-created in the precise storefront location it occupied at the time. If anything Van Sant and his team including cinematographer Harris Savides who so strikingly helped David Fincher evoke the same city and general era in ""Zodiac"" have downplayed ostentatious period manifestations in costuming production design and music in a bid to make a naturalistic film with a lived-in look.
