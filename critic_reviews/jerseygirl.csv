Pic overall resembles a ""very special episode"" of a routine sitcom. There simply isnt enough here to draw significant numbers of non-fans to megaplexes. Kevin Smith wades into familiar mainstream territory with ""Jersey Girl"" a bland slab of sentimental hokum that proves even the most smart-alecky of indie auteurs can turn warm and fuzzy on occasion. Despite flashes of barbed wit and some engaging performances pic overall resembles a ""very special episode"" of a routine sitcom. Diehard fans of Smiths ""Clerks"" ""Dogma"" and ""Chasing Amy"" will likely be disappointed. Trouble is there simply isnt enough here to draw significant numbers of non-fans to megaplexes. Oft-delayed Miramax release might benefit from curiosity value of Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez briefly reteamed onscreen. (Insert ""Gigli"" joke here.) But Lopez is scarcely more than a bit player in ""Jersey Girl"" as bulk of pic happens after her character dies focusing on Affleck as a widowed father raising a precocious daughter. Lopez barely makes it to the 12-minute mark as Gertrude loving wife of hotshot Manhattan music publicist Ollie Trinke who dies during childbirth. The tragedy leaves Ollie distraught distressed -- and evidently too traumatized to fully grasp the rudiments of changing diapers. Does Ollie hire a housekeeper or babysitter? No way In this shamelessly contrived comedy seemingly smart people must repeatedly do dumb things to keep the plot from grinding to a complete halt. Ollie and his daughter -- named Gertie after her late mother -- move to Highlands N.J. to live with Bart (George Carlin) Ollies widowed dad whos employed by the local public works department. Ollie leaves Gertie in Barts care while he commutes to his Manhattan office. Naturally Bart eventually rebels against this imposition and just as naturally he picks the day of an important publicity event to leave Ollie literally holding the baby. The stressed-for-success exec buckles under the pressure of caring for a bawling infant while entertaining a Hard Rock Cafe-full of impatient TV and print reporters. So he snaps at the press makes a rude comment about his tardy client -- Will Smith no less -- and is canned. Years pass. Ollie cant find employment as a publicist so hes stuck in a dead-end job alongside his father. Hes a loving and devoted father for 8-year-old Gertie (Raquel Castro) but hes still too hung up on his dearly departed wife to seek a love life. However he does occasionally check out a porno tape from the back room of his neighborhood videostore. This attracts the attention of a perky store clerk Maya (Liv Tyler) who selflessly offers to give him a ""mercy hump."" Theyre interrupted but a tentative romance blooms. ""Jersey Girl"" begins to build toward its predictably schmaltzy climax when Ollie lands an interview for a Manhattan PR job thanks to a former colleague (Jason Biggs). Unfortunately the interview is on the very afternoon of Gerties school musical revue. But wait theres more Gertie insists she doesnt want to live in Manhattan. Hence Ollie must choose between a once-in-a-lifetime career opportunity and pleasing his 8-year-old daughter. Affleck hits all the right notes while conveying Ollies conflicting attitudes and emotions. He also develops an affecting father-daughter dynamic with Castro a well-cast newcomer whos appreciably more natural than many other child actors. On several occasions however the script stoops to cheap gags that undercut Afflecks efforts to sustain a believable character. For example at one point Ollie agrees to take Gertie to any Broadway show she chooses. She picks ""Sweeney Todd"" cuing a scene in which Ollie is shocked to discover what the show is about. Ollie who was a sophisticated music publicist in Manhattan knows absolutely nothing about one of the most famous Broadway musicals of the last quarter-century. Yeah right. Tyler and Carlin handle their supporting roles with spirited aplomb -- so does Lopez for that matter -- and Will Smith is a good sport in an unbilled cameo as himself. Matt Damon and Jason Lee are even funnier during their fleeting appearances as advertising execs who admire Ollies nerve but refuse to give him a job. In terms of production values ""Jersey Girl"" marks a considerable leap forward from Kevin Smiths earlier grungier work. (Indeed Vilmos Zsigmonds ace lensing is almost too beautiful for pics own good.) In just about every other respect however the comedy represents a step in the wrong direction. Its worth noting that almost every title prominently displayed in Mayas videostore is a Miramax release. ""Jersey Girl"" doubtless will be stocked on a bottom shelf there very very soon.

Lo and Gigli the screens lamentable Daredevil and a Christmas Paycheck that bounced. Yet Girl is so patchy that you worry its going to sink. Ben Affleck bounces back from a string of box office flops with the help of newcomer Raquel Castro. Miramax Surprisingly Jennifer Lopez is a neutral presence until the script kills her off in the first 15 minutes. And though the movies calculated sentiment makes it as cloying as it is funny the film could be a small net gain for Smiths career in the long run. Yes its feel-good gushiness probably will displease his mall-rat fan base. But it does suggest wider filmmaking latitude than one would expect from the writer/director who sired Jay Silent Bob and those crude Clerks who slept on the stores floor. For much of this movie though Affleck doesnt feel good about much. Afflecks Ollie is happily overworked as New Yorks hottest music publicist until wife Lopez dies in childbirth. Then he melts down while multi-tasking during a Hard Rock Cafe news conference. While ranting at reporters he insults client Will Smith which gets him banished back to hometown Highlands N.J. There seven years later he sweeps streets and lives with his dad (creatively cast George Carlin) while raising his daughter. ABOUT THE MOVIE Jersey Girl   1/2 (out of four) Stars Ben Affleck Raquel Castro Liv Tyler George Carlin Jennifer Lopez Director Kevin Smith Distributor Miramax Rating PG-13 for language and sexual content including frank dialogue Opens Friday nationwide This transformed life like so much here is never fully credible; it all comes down to which scenes you want to believe. Girls great find is young Raquel Castro as the daughter. Looking as if she really could be J. Lo offspring she brings out the best in Affleck. The role itself suits him an actor who is much better in roles that are multi-dimensional (even if they have vices as in 2000s Boiler Room). A climactic school talent show also is inspired providing the movie the twist it needs after a long soft stretch. Less successful are Carlins buddies who through no fault of the actors seem like the corny character types from later and much lesser Frank Capra comedies. And a more dynamic actress than sleepy Liv Tyler might have gone to town in her role as a video store clerk who revitalizes the parts of Affleck his daughter cant. Smith is looking more and more like a developing major talent so it could be years until we get a handle on this movies legacy. The film is not only defensible as a cute one-shot but also as a positive sign for the future. For now look for both fans and detractors to overstate their cases.

But you probably know it already because Ben Afflecks been talking about it to any interviewer who will listen Jennifer Lopezs character in this movie? She dies. Early. Seriously youll barely be past that top buttery layer in your popcorn when Lopez buys the farm about 10 minutes in. And you will be relieved because her character is so whiny and annoying by the time she goes that you just might be tempted to jump into the movie and do her in yourself. (Its not Lopezs fault; the roles poorly written -- or more likely drastically edited.) So this isnt ""Gigli."" Lets all move on. Everybody past the Ben-and-J.Lo thing now? Good. Because this movie isnt about the two of them at all but a rather more interesting couple Ollie (Affleck) a young widower and Gertie (Raquel Castro) his daughter. After Gerties mom (Lopez) dies suddenly in childbirth Ollie loses his job as a high-powered New York music publicist and retreats to his fathers house in New Jersey where he takes a dull job with the city and carefully guards his broken heart as the years go by. Movie review Showtimes and trailer 1/2 ""Jersey Girl"" with Ben Affleck Liv Tyler George Carlin Stephen Root Mike Starr Raquel Castro Jason Biggs Jennifer Lopez. Written and directed by Kevin Smith. 103 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual content including frank dialogue. Several theaters. Theres romance in Ollies future with the beguiling clerk at the video store (Liv Tyler wearing glasses and employing a Melanie Griffith-ish baby voice). But writer/director Kevin Smith (who dedicates the movie to his father) focuses the movie more on parenthood -- on how a previously shallow man finds his soul by caring for his child. Its not a remotely fresh idea -- at times ""Jersey Girl"" feels like a pale copy of ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" ""Baby Boom"" or any of a number of single-parent-makes-good movies. But its saved by an unusually charming child actor Castro who has a voice like a pan flute and a sweetly low-key screen presence. Smith seems to have a knack for working with kids; Castro obviously wasnt encouraged to be extra-cute as so many movie kids are which makes her performance honest and likable. George Carlin is nicely crusty as Ollies dad. And Affleck ... well he hasnt really challenged himself since ""Changing Lanes"" (yes he can act go rent it) and doesnt do much thats surprising here beyond his usual slick-yuppie routine but he and the kid find a nice chemistry. And Will Smith plays himself in an endearing cameo offering father-to-father advice to Ollie as they sit in a waiting room. (You wonder though what kind of publicist would make Will Smith sit in a waiting room.) ""Jersey Girl"" feels like a labor of love; theres a wealth of careful detail in this familys world. Gertie sleeps in whats obviously her fathers childhood room with its truck wallpaper. Its never mentioned but the fact that this was never swapped for something more girlie underscores Ollies attitude toward living with his father -- its temporary even after seven years. Overall ""Jersey Girl"" doesnt quite work; the movie never figures out what to do with Tyler and the life lessons Ollie learns seem unusually obvious. But its a sweet little movie all the same. Skip the first 10 minutes and its probably even sweeter.

(AP Photo/Peter Sorel) Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler in Kevin Smiths ""Jersey Girl."" (AP Photo/Peter Sorel) Photo PETER SOREL Down and out in New Jersey without Jennifer Lopez by his side 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Jersey Girl Comedy/Drama. Starring Ben Affleck George Carlin Raquel Castro and Liv Tyler. Directed by Kevin Smith. (PG-13. 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Jersey Girl"" is writer-director Kevin Smiths attempt to branch out from his vulgar-slacker-comedy niche and make a normal movie for grownups. Fortunately that doesnt mean hes trying to suppress his sense of humor. The best thing about ""Jersey Girl"" is Smiths personality -- his mix of irreverence and real reverence his coarse but apt turns of phrase his optimism and honesty. All this comes across in the writing and even in the performances. His movie is strong in its details and yet Smith gets all the big things wrong. The films overall construction is faulty. Its dramatic situations ring consistently false and the story is phony as anything off the Hollywood assembly line. And yet its sincere phony. Smith is trying to say something heartfelt even as hes using formulas that are unworthy of him. Thus ""Jersey Girl"" is a step not a misstep. If next time Smith feels more confident about following his emotions and his characters into uncharted territory hell be able to look back on this movie as a learning experience. But how much can he learn? Thats the tantalizing question that hovers around Smith and needs to be articulated. ""Jersey Girl"" finds him at a stage in his development where its hard to know whether hes an endearing amusing slob or something more. And if more how much more? Clearly he has thoughts a genuine bigness of spirit and an apparent desire to communicate both as well as a willingness to keep it small and not go for the blockbuster. Would it destroy him or liberate him if he strove in earnest for the brass ring -- if he tried becoming say an ungainly New Jersey version of Francois Truffaut? He works well with actors. Ben Affleck who stars has not seemed so natural and unguarded in years -- not since the last time he worked with Smith anyway. He plays Ollie a hotshot Manhattan publicity man who has a whirlwind courtship with Gertrude played by Jennifer Lopez who makes a vivid impression in her brief appearance here. Suffice it to say that within 20 minutes of screen time Ollie has lost it all -- his wife his job his New York life. He finds himself back in New Jersey living with his newborn baby daughter and his father played by George Carlin whos convincingly gruff and blue-collar in a straight role. Smith would have us believe that Ollie is ostracized from the world of public relations because of an emotional outburst at a press conference in which he badmouthed the press and his client. Thats a real stretch the first of many. From there we meet Ollie a few years down the line still trying to break back into publicity. Meanwhile his daughter -- played by little Raquel Castro whos charming until Smiths script turns her into a brat -- attends first grade. ""Jersey Girl"" mainly concerns itself with the details of Ollies domestic life. The movie goes nowhere but goes along pleasantly. Liv Tyler never more spontaneous and appealing enters the picture as a graduate student who works in the local video store. When she finds out that Ollie hasnt had sex in seven years she exclaims ""You have to get back on the horse man"" The characters male and female all sound like Smith but it doesnt matter so long as theyre funny. The movie fully and fatally collapses only when Smith -- in search of some kind of pat dramatic situation -- sets up a conflict between Ollies finally realizing his professional dreams and Ollie doing right by his family. As a father and an artist Smith should know that that dichotomy is not only false but sentimental and self-serving. But he lays it on thick even carting out that other Smith -- Will Smith -- for a cameo in which he says its better to play in the dirt with your kids all day than to make movies. Of course for most people -- including Ollie -- thats not really a choice. One way or the other he has to work and the only question is whether hell like his work or hate it. It would take a person of less imagination than Kevin Smith not to know that having a professionally miserable father staring into space and wondering what became of his promise is no recipe for domestic happiness. -- Advisory Some strong language and sexual situations.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance.

We know thanks to a blitz of interviews that he doesnt think its his funniest or most original movie - and hes being kind Its a goopy well duh of a family drama a poor relation to ""About a Boy"" about how its better to be a nice daddy in modest New Jersey than to be a freakin workaholic pig in fancy Manhattan with Ben Affleck in the role of a reformed big-city schmuck named Ollie and Raquel Castro as his spunky 8-year-old daughter. (Theres no room in the equation to be a nice daddy and a nice Gothamite.) The movie is padded with clunkily sincere notes about real life e.g. babies need diaper changes. And it requires George Carlin to growl shamelessly as Afflecks casually alcoholic father and Liv Tyler to beam tirelessly as the most luscious Jersey video-store clerk ever to offer a guy a ""mercy jump."" We also know in advance that Jennifer Lopezs character dies within minutes of the opening and that we wont miss her Lopez perhaps youve heard plays the wife of her former real-life fiance. Alas the missus expires in a dainty death-by-childbirth scene during which Lopez essays some graceful labor exertions then elegantly kicks. But Smith has been too modest Nowhere did he boast as he could have that ""Jersey Girl"" is the first production to ever cast a little girl as the mad baker Mrs. Lovett who cheerily slits throats in Stephen Sondheims musical masterpiece Sweeney Todd - and Castro duets with her daddy as the demon barber of the title. I mean for some four fifths of its length ""Jersey Girl"" is as square as a turnpike-diner place mat and then for one jaw-dropping scene its an avant-garde performance piece starring Ben Affleck and some kid singing about bloody meat pies Dude that is funny and original - remember that feeling?

(CNN) -- Guess what? ""Jersey Girl"" is a whole lot better than ""Gigli."" Of course thats not saying much is it? But stay with me. ""Jersey Girl"" shows that director and writer Kevin Smith is growing up. However thats not quite enough to make the film good. ""Jersey Girl"" has a number of flaws -- among them an uncertainty about itself -- and it wont be the boost star Ben Afflecks career needs.Smith is the man who put Affleck on Hollywoods map back in 1997 with ""Chasing Amy""; this latest project is their fifth collaboration. Like Affleck Smiths career has had its ups and downs and hes had his share of clinkers. ""Jersey Girl"" is a personal -- and more adult -- story which draws from his own life as a husband and father. Affleck plays Ollie Trinke an extremely successful music public relations flack in Manhattan. Hes got the world by a string and having the time of his life. Jennifer Lopez -- in her second and probably last gig with Affleck -- plays his equally successful wife Gertrude Steiney. (If nothing else Smith has made up some of the strangest character names ever used -- Ollie Trinke? Gertrude Steiney?)But I digress. When Gertrude becomes pregnant Ollies whole life begins to change -- but nothing prepares him for what happens when she dies in childbirth and hes suddenly a single parent. Thats right Lopezs character dies 15 minutes into the film. (Insert your own sarcastic comment here.)New lives After his wife dies Afflecks character moves in with his father (George Carlin).With nowhere else to turn Ollie moves back home to New Jersey with his crusty widower father Bart (George Carlin). For a while Ollie attempts to keep his high-profile life and shoves all of the responsibility for his newborn daughter named Gertie after her mother onto his reluctant father. (After the infant stage and for most of the film Gertie is played by 8-year-old Raquel Castro.)But soon Bart rebels and insists that his son accept responsibility for Gertie. This results in Ollie having to take the baby to a big PR event at Planet Hollywood in New York City. The event is for a little-known actor named Will Smith who is soon to appear in a new movie called ""Independence Day."" When Smith fails to show up (he becomes a running gag throughout the film) Ollie explodes in front of the press and tells them exactly what he thinks of them the rags they work for and this nobody named Will Smith. Not exactly a good career move. He loses his job and finds himself driving a street cleaner just like his father in the little Jersey town where he grew up.A few years pass and Ollie seems resigned to his life with his daughter and father when he meets a video store clerk named Maya played by Liv Tyler. She reawakens his romantic side and the two start dating. But shes fully aware that hes only half-present and that he really wants his old life back. ""Forget about who you thought you were and just accept who you are"" she tells him at one point. So when Ollie is finally able to land another PR job back back in Manhattan hes faced with the question what exactly does he need to be truly happy?Shaky points CNN reviewer Paul Clinton says Affleck and co-star Liv Tyler playing a video store clerk have good chemistry.Affleck has a lot riding on this film. After ""Daredevil"" ""Gigli"" and ""Paycheck"" the man needs a hit. ""Jersey Girl"" aint going be it. Kevin Smith should be commended for trying to stretch beyond his adolescent gags in previous films and for actually trying to deal with mature themes. But the results are shaky.Shaky point number one does Ollie really have only two choices in life big-time PR executive or blue-collar street sweeper? Theres nothing in between? Thats it?Shaky point number two Though he does a decent job overall Affleck tends to hit just one note for Ollie for most of the film. His selfish attitudes in the beginning of the story dont mellow out until way too late. By the time he suddenly becomes sympathetic the train has left the station.On the plus side Tyler and Affleck (they co-starred in ""Armageddon"") do have screen chemistry and young Miss Castro is as cute as a button.There are some wonderful moments in ""Jersey Girl"" the best an inspired elementary school stage production of ""Sweeney Todd."" (Dont ask -- you have to see it to believe it.) Also this is one of the best acting jobs Affleck has done in a while. Unfortunately ""Jersey Girl"" cant make up its mind what it wants to be. Its way too tame for Smiths hardcore fans -- theyll probably hate every minute of it -- and not solid enough to draw new admirers. Its neither comedy nor drama fish nor fowl and thats a shame.""Jersey Girl"" opens nationwide on Friday March 26 and is rated PG-13.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.
