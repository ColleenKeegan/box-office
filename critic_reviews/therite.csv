"Queen of Spades shuffles through horror genre deck and plays all the cards - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Queen of Spades shuffles through horror genre deck and plays all the cards ""Queen of Spades"" Level 33 Alina Babak in the film ""Queen of Spades."" Alina Babak in the film ""Queen of Spades."" (Level 33) Noel Murray Horror films rarely look as handsome as the Russian supernatural thriller ""Queen of Spades The Dark Rite."" From its sickly pale tinting to its use of subtly glowing light sources director Svyatoslav Podgayevskiys movie is always easy on the eyes.But thats about the best that can be said for it. A compendium of genre cliches -- or more charitably ""homages"" -- ""Queen of Spades"" offers little that fright fans havent seen before. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story The film follows what happens when one familys children playfully summon a mirror-dwelling demon by reciting its name three times. Soon their apartment is being rocked by strange noises and shadows; and eventually their possessed youngest daughter has become a snarling foul-mouthed hellion.It takes about an hour for ""Queen of Spades"" to move beyond quietly spooky to shocking. Even then it suffers from how many ideas and images Podgayevskiy swipes from other better movies. Connoisseurs and casual cinephiles alike should be able to track the similarities to ""Candyman"" The Exorcist"" ""Poltergeist"" ""The Shining"" ""Oculus"" ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" and the list goes on. ""Queen of Spades"" is more dull than dire but during the long stretches where not much is happening theres plenty of time to get irritated by how indistinguishable this picture is from its American counterparts. Heres a movie made halfway around the world that could just as easily have been shot in Glendale.-------------""Queen of Spades The Dark Rite""In Russian with English subtitlesNo ratingRunning time 1 hour 33 minutesPlaying Arena Cinema Hollywood Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-capsule-queen-of-spades-review-20160606-snap-story.html,200,therite0,therite,latimes
