The movie transcends its stars controversial career and in the bargain stands head shoulders and heart above every other Hollywood movie that weve seen so far this year. ""8 Mile"" is in many ways classic Hollywood fare one of those oft-told tales in which an impoverished young musician -- or athlete or writer -- finds success through sheer talent plus indomitable will. The protagonist here is Jimmy Smith Jr. Hes an angry white kid living at home in 1995 in a shabby trailer with his little sister and their infantile alcoholic mother and hanging out with mostly black friends at hip-hop clubs in the bleakscape of urban Detroit. (The title refers to 8 Mile Road a boundary line between city and suburbs.) Yet the film which was directed by Curtis Hanson from a script by Scott Silver has its own look language cadence and integrity. The bleakness is relieved by harsh beauty -- Rodrigo Prieto did the riveting cinematography Philip Messina was the production designer -- and by brash comedy seemingly caught on the fly like the flashes of startling eloquence that Jimmy catches in his lurching or hurtling rhymes. The filmmakers have shrewdly delimited their subject; the story ends just as fame beckons. (In a nice final touch the hard-working hero decides to keep his day job at a stamping plant.) ""8 Mile"" conveys the essence of Eminems early development without obligating itself to address the troubling issue of some of his later lyrics that have been denounced rightly or wrongly as misogynistic homophobic or antisocial. Thus the movie which opens in theaters just as Eminem himself is gaining mainstream respectability as never before has all the makings of a huge hit. (The soundtrack features two of Eminems songs and a poundingly bountiful assortment of mid-1990s hip-hop.) Theres no whitewashing though no flagrant softening of the subject. A few flirtations with sentimentality can be found in encounters between Jimmy and his mother who is played with extraordinary poignancy and ferocity by Kim Basinger (lets not hold her beauty against her) and at moments when hes protective of his much younger sister who may be seen as a surrogate figure for Eminems real-life daughter Hailie. (In that real life he was sued by his mother for defamation.) Otherwise Jimmy Smith is angry enough and on occasion violent enough to gratify Eminem fans and detractors alike. (And profane enough to peel graffiti off a wall.) At the same time hes clearly an artist struggling to find his own voice in a movie that manages to show how art can spring spontaneously from life. Its terrifically exciting and entertaining when Jimmy overcomes his initial fear and takes on the reigning black rappers of his hood. Their weapon of choice is the blunt insult. His is switchblade wit -- the bon mot or the mot juste even though given hip-hops syntax the best mot is raw and juicy. In one delicious and pivotal triumph he destroys a sullen ostensibly formidable opponent by revealing him to be a private-school student with two happily married parents. Eminem who was born Marshall Bruce Mathers III has long been seen as a hip-hop virtuoso; for many his preeminence is a settled thing. With this film he also proves himself a skillful actor and a powerful one. Hes an intense often brooding presence on screen -- not exactly profligate with his smiles but adept at focusing his keen intelligence and vast energy. Its easy to like Jimmy Smith as well as to admire him because Mr. Mathers lets us in with no sign of calculation on the kindness even tenderness that Jimmy conceals from most of the people around him. The people around him are impressive as well. The supporting cast includes Mekhi Phifer Brittany Murphy (whose flashy role as an ambitious lascivious sprite helps to justify her acting tricks) Evan Jones Omar Benson Miller Eugene Byrd and DeAngelo Wilson. When I first read of Curtis Hansons involvement in a film starring Eminem I wondered with some bafflement what the man whod directed the great ""L.A. Confidential"" and the delightful ""Wonder Boys"" was getting himself into. Now we know what he and his producer Brian Grazer had in mind and the result is uncommonly rewarding. Weve learned something else about Mr. Hanson both as a director and a guide through trackless territories. Hes reliable. Once he settles on something to do its bound to be worth doing. Far From Heaven In ""Far From Heaven"" which stars Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid as prisoners of a tortured marriage the writer-director Todd Haynes tries to have it every which way with 1950s melodrama and almost succeeds. To judge from its sumptuous surface of stylish clothes handsome homes manicured gardens and autumn leaves this film might actually be some long-lost gem of the hoary genre which was best represented by the work of Douglas Sirk. (Among his mesmerizing potboilers were ""Written on the Wind"" and florid remakes of ""Magnificent Obsession"" and ""Imitation of Life."") But those movies were made at a time of emotional and cultural repression when undercurrents stayed under. Mr. Hayness ambitious game is to deconstruct the genre by speaking the unspoken dramatizing what those smooth surfaces concealed. The tortures of his couple Cathy and Frank Whitaker are no secret. Frank is gay so poor Cathy who is not only passionate but a liberal in a racist era -- the year is 1957 -- takes up with a sophisticated black gardener played by Dennis Haysbert. ""Far From Heaven"" has a lot going for it Ms. Moores graceful performance; alluring cinematography and production design (by respectively Edward Lachman and Mark Friedberg); impeccable period details (my preview audience laughed at Tupperware and daiquiris); and the novelty of a contemporary movie that discusses significant issues. Theres also the intriguing matter of aesthetics; Mr. Haynes is bringing heightened reality to a genre that was so thoroughly but astutely artificial as to recognize and call attention to its own shallowness. Yet dramatic energy is in short supply. The actors move about this elaborate movie museum in a modified dream state as if living in the present while rooted in the past. But the strategy doesnt work. Its an imitation of lifelessness. Derrida A true story about life and learning in Santa Monica. We were four for dinner last Saturday night and the waitress was as attentive as she was actress-attractive -- lots of smiles and is-everything-all-rights. When the talk turned to movies one of my friends asked if Id heard of a documentary about Jacques Derrida the French philosopher who founded Deconstructionism. Yes I told him Ill be reviewing it for Fridays paper. Suddenly our waitress gasped. ""Derrida?"" she asked steadying an armful of plates. ""Theres a movie about Jacques Derrida?"" I said there was and asked how she happened to know him. ""Im a philosopher"" she exclaimed. ""Im working on my doctorate at UCLA."" Im not a philosopher but I enjoyed ""Derrida"" all the same. More than enjoyed it -- delighted in its playful but penetrating portrait of a deep thinker whose on-camera thoughts frequently turn to the dishonesty of his self-portrayal. Concerned about truth as philosophers must be Mr. Derrida takes great and endearing pains to emphasize that what the lens shows is not truly him but a surrogate that he has created in response to the artificial surroundings. In this sense he forces the film by Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering Kofman to deconstruct its edgy subject. Whats left is challenging and fascinating -- everything you didnt know you didnt know about Derridas life and work.    As many readers pointed out Robert Culp not Bill Cosby played the tennis pro in the TV series ""I Spy"" (See last weeks review); Mr. Cosby was his trainer. One reader went so far as to say that ""present-day movie reviewers universally"" make this mistake. Maybe so but I still feel Culpable.    VIDEO TIP Curtis Hanson has cited ""Hoop Dreams"" (1994) as one of the films that influenced his approach to ""8 Mile."" Produced by Frederick Marx Steve James and Peter Gilbert and directed by Mr. James this superb documentary feature spans four years in the lives of two inner-city-Chicago kids who dream of parlaying their basketball skills into NBA stardom.

By David Denby In Eminems first movie ""8 Mile"" the white rap star is hooded in about five different ways at once Theres a Nike knit cap on his head and above that the top of a maroon sweatshirt. His eyelids are partly lowered his ears are covered with headphones his body is sheathed in loose-fitting sweats. You cant see much of him and whats visible is guarded and hostile--his upper lip has a mean double curl a natural snarl. As a camera subject Eminem is resistant material--he has the general aspect of a walking hard-on--but hes fascinating too and his way of withholding himself is both a natural reflex and a method of teasing and dominating everyone else. His trick is to turn self-effacement into a weapon. When he breaks out with his stiletto voice in profane lyrics with charged interior rhymes the rapping has a malign power and he stays on top of the beat. Hes very fast the way Sugar Ray Robinson was fast in the ring. Like the fighting in ""Rocky"" and the dancing in ""Saturday Night Fever"" the rap songs in ""8 Mile"" possess a redemptive power. They release intolerable feelings of disgust the fear of remaining a loser forever. Its a relief to see Eminem give up the preening megalomania of his last album ""The Eminem Show"" in which he seemed inordinately impressed with the size of his fame--that is the threat that his success represented to the parents powers and principalities of America. In ""8 Mile"" Lynne Cheney is not the enemy--at least not explicitly. Eminem lays off the ""bitches"" too and mostly gives the ""faggots"" a rest. He doesnt threaten to ""kill"" everyone in sight. Hes gone back to his roots or at least a mythicized version of his roots. Eminem born Marshall Mathers III plays Jimmy Smith Jr. known as Rabbit. The time is 1995 and Jimmy lives with his blowsy feckless mother (Kim Basinger) in a trailer park in Detroit well within 8 Mile Road the perimeter that divides the inner city from Detroits affluent white suburbs. He works in a metal-pressing plant but his real life is spent with friends--his crew mainly black who serve as his supporters jesters and stooges. Meeting on some ragged street the men clasp hands and gently touch their right shoulders leaning forward like stately birds in some preordained ritual. Jimmy is the best rapper and no one in his crew challenges him as leader. On Saturday nights at an old club the Shelter he goes up against the rap leaders of other gangs all black. Its a scene that dates back at least as far as the street-corner tradition of ""playing the dozens"" staged as gladitorial combat. First one man raps and the victim stares back without flinching (the stare is both offense and defense). Then the second one goes at it picking up material from the attack and ""flipping"" it. The goal is to be as low-down personal and wounding as possible. Yet nuance and virtuosity matter. You cant simply slam or curse your way to success; you have to be smart and funny and the audience chooses the winner. Curtis Hanson (""L.A. Confidential"" ""Wonder Boys"") working from a script by Scott Silver uses a handheld camera for the musical numbers. But Hanson doesnt whip the movie up like a music video. He lays out the narrative and the character relationships methodically even slowly; ""8 Mile"" has some quiet sequences and some measure which is an unconventional quality to bring to a rap movie. The filmmakers (Brian Grazer initiated the project and produced it) have got their hands on the biggest pop phenomenon since Madonna and they are determined to engage the emotions of a large mixed-race audience. My guess is that they will. This nasty-faced genius-punk is hurting all the time but doesnt ask for anything. Hes suffering cut off--a recessive champ who cares for his tiny little sister more than anyone else. He trains constantly writing down rhymes on dirty sheets of paper with nothing but a beat playing in his ear. In the tradition of ""Rocky"" and ""Fever"" the movie is a shrewdly engineered piece of proletarian pop--a story of triumph--but like Eminems enraged lyrics ""8 Mile"" has its own kind of vile candor. The great Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (""Amores Perros"") keeps the visual palette ugly and raw--gray skies damp streets dank factories graffiti-covered buildings. ""8 Mile"" is about Detroitismo in all its misery of sunken hopes and defiance. The movie says ""Out of this junk out of the self-hatred and anger that grow from living amid junk rappers will make their art."" There is an effective sequence in which a female worker at Jimmys plant takes a soggy sandwich off a lunch cart begins rapping in complaint a man tops her and Jimmy hanging on the fringes charges into the group and tops the topper. Authenticity and spontaneity joined together--thats the claim made for rap as art. That large amounts of rap white and black may actually be calculated to please fourteen-year-old boys in Scarsdale is not even hinted at in ""8 Mile."" Yet the movie is not quite naive. Jimmy spends a lot of time seeking the ""deal"" the ""demo"" that will liberate him and he wants to know who his true friend is--that is which one of his circle will promote his talent. Nothing else really matters to him. He has a lot in common with the young black men around him. He lives at home with his mother as they do he has a lousy job he speaks like them raps like them. Theres a good deal of shoving back and forth along racial lines in the movie and at one point Jimmy stoically accepts a beating from a black gang. But the male relationships unfold with an intimacy and ease that go way beyond the coy teasing in ""48 HRS."" and ""Men in Black."" People who are convinced that Eminem is destroying America might want to consider the delicacy of the white-black friendships in ""8 Mile."" (Perhaps the spectre of such friendships is what right-wingers actually hate most.) Race is an issue but its not the most important issue. The universal appreciation of talent matters more. When Jimmy breaks out the black audience at the Shelter gives him his due just as black listeners have given Eminem his due as a grownup rapper. Fair is fair the man can do it. In the end Jimmy is a winner who is still hooded and distant. He stares at women the same way he stares at his enemies; in effect women are his enemies. A bright-eyed little mover (Brittany Murphy) who wants to be a model believes in Jimmy but she immediately betrays her guy as the girls always do in Eminems world. In any case hes not interested. The master myth here may be derived less from pop culture than from ""Henry IV Part I."" Jimmy is Prince Hal a king in waiting roistering among low company a brawler who will eventually show his true colors. He rejects many of his friends--the movie ends in a series of renunciations--because hes headed for better things. Eminem does not come off as a megalomaniac in ""8 Mile"" but he expects people to be very very impressed. I doubt he could lend himself to a fiction that said anything else his eyes couldnt tell any story but his own. Despite the friendships he is always alone and at the end of the movie he walks down a rotting alley toward the still lonelier road of fame. ""8 Mile"" wisely covers only a few weeks in time. But Julie Taymors ""Frida"" covers a span of thirty years and it includes as its subjects left-wing politics and the nature of marriage as well as the life of an artist. At the center of the movie is the relationship always described as ""tempestuous"" between the great Mexican muralist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) and the talented painter Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek). I have to admit that after an hour or so of this Punch-and-Judy show with its noisy drinking hurling of brightly painted kitchen items partings and reconciliations I was ready to knock both lovers flat with a large red chili pepper. Still given its ramshackle construction and its repetitions ""Frida"" is much better than it has any right to be. The movie has a rambunctious spirit and a liberated sense of color--an appreciation of the raw strong Mexican folk tradition that gave both artists their special juice. Taymor and the gaggle of screenwriters who worked on the movie are much too shrewd to accept the sentimental feminist view that Kahlo was Riveras victim. Smart willful and perverse this Frida is nobodys servant and the tiny Hayek plays her with head held high. You may want to laugh now and then but you wont look away.

With Eminem Kim Basinger Brittany Murphy Mekhi Phifer. Directed by Curtis Hanson. Running time 111 minutes. Rated R strong language sexuality some violence and drug use. 3 Stars. Yes Eminem is all that. If there is anyone who has not yet been charmed by Eminems bouncy rhythms clever wordplay and the essentially decent nature that peeks through his self-imposed anger-management program of cathartic rap theyll ""get"" him once they see ""8 Mile"" a movie that in its own way approximates the experience of listening to Eminems CDs. The rap star rose to prominence while assuming multiple personalities - among them his alter ego Slim Shady an obsessed fan named Stan or the devil on his shoulder in ""Guilty Conscience."" So it comes as no surprise that he is thoroughly at home in his movie debut playing someone so much like himself you could mistake ""8 Mile"" for a biopic. All the elements are there - the Detroit origins the broken home complete with crudely demoralizing mom the challenge for a white kid of being accepted by black rap culture. The message of Eminems life has been that talent will out. And its certainly out in force in ""8 Mile"" named after Detroits wrong side of the tracks. Under the direction of Curtis Hanson who with ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Wonder Boys"" is known for inspiring actors to greater heights the rap star formerly known as Marshall Mathers 3rd doesnt hit a single wrong note. Hes a modest lightly brooding presence who doesnt embarrass himself like many pop stars who let their egos do the emoting. He truly comes alive any time he raps as if like his character nothing earthly can touch him during those transcendent endorphin-rushing moments. Of course hes not asked to attempt anything beyond the range of what we already know he can do - rage satire frustration and a touching tenderness around children. And the movie follows a tried-and-true formula in which the underdog who barks last barks loudest. As Jimmy (Rabbit) Smith hes the equivalent of the welder-by-day dancer-by-night of ""Flashdance"" Jimmy works in a Detroit metal-stamping plant making car fenders and after hours he hits the clubs where he hopes to be recognized in the high-anxiety rap-offs that separate the players from the wanna-bes. The first time Jimmy tries to compete in one of these rhymed timed dissing contests he chokes onstage which is about as good for his social standing as living in a trailer park with his supremely self-involved mother (Kim Basinger). With the encouragement of pals (most prominently Mekhi Phifer) and a new sexily low-rent girlfriend (Brittany Murphy) Jimmy keeps plugging away his anger and frustration growing and gradually finding voice. Its not giving anything away to say that when Jimmy finally gets it together and hurls his rhymed invective like Zeus tossing his thunderbolts its clear that one day he like Eminem will have the rap world by the Detroit fenders. Basinger gives one of her best performances as a woman too young poor and overwhelmed to handle motherhood. And the uncommonly self-assured Murphy proves again that she is a cut above other actresses of her tender years. In addition to showcasing Mathers ""8 Mile"" makes a case for rap as a creative rebel yell. The movie is designed for a general crossover audience so rap is shown as a legitimate weapon that in the right hands offers a benevolent means of self-defense.

After all nothing could kill a rappers credibility faster than doing Elvis corny Blue Hawaii thing or twittering cutely like the Beatles in A Hard Days Night or acting with the woodenness of Madonna dialogue clattering from her lips like clothespins. Eminem obviously knew all this -- hes a master at manipulating his persona -- and has taken care to make it real for ""Eric and Erica."" Equal parts teen flick and family psychodrama this semiautobiographical hip-hop creation myth gives us Eminem as hed probably like us to see him. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The story takes place in 1995 Detroit a rapidly declining city whose 8 Mile Road marks the borderline between the urban and the suburban the black and the white. Rabbit (Eminem) hopes to cross that line and when we first see him hes entered a face-to-face rap-off at a local club. He chokes and the rest of the movie is about getting him back to the club so he can win the next contest (he is after all Eminem). Along the way 8 Mile shows us Rabbits art being forged in the cauldron of his daily life. He works at a metal-pressing company and lives in a trailer with his mother (Kim Basinger) a dim selfish woman who first appears straddling one of Rabbits former high school classmates. Along with his predominantly black posse Rabbit drives around aimlessly in his battered car firing paintballs at police cruisers getting into meaningless fights and engaging in scads of talk about getting out of the 313 Area Code. Predictably he meets his muse an aspiring model played by revved-up Britney Murphy who seems as loony here as she did at the MTV Music Awards -- her eyes spin like cherries in a slot machine.8 Mile was directed with muscular verve by Curtis Hanson who like Eminem is eager not to be pigeonholed. After years of chasing Hitchcocks shadow in thrillers like The Bedroom Window and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle he scored a huge critical hit with L.A. Confidential. Hanson has a feel for fading cities (his last film Wonder Boys vividly evokes the tawdry splendors of Pittsburgh) and here his gritty shooting style makes us feel the oppressive physical and psychological truth of Detroits collapse. Rabbit inhabits a landscape of trailers gutted houses liquor stores cheap nightclubs glorious old buildings grown encrusted with failure. The only way out is through artistic self-creation.Thats how Eminem did it and he plays Rabbit with riveting flamboyantly expressive intensity His eyes go from hooded to eerily wide each pang of emotion flickering across his features and beneath that stocking cap he can look almost feminine. Hes not a great actor but as youd expect of one who pushed rap to new levels of psychological revelation hes not afraid to lay himself on the line. In fact for all his skill at putting on masks his real genius is for self-exposure for transforming anger and self-pity (boy he has plenty) into incandescent language. The same is true of Rabbit who doesnt deny his own white-trash background (as a wonderful send-up of Lynyrd Skynyrds ""Sweet Home Alabama"" makes clear) or try to be black. Rather he takes his underclass roots and unhappy past and uses them as a source of power and authority. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm It would be nice to say that this movie matches the ferocious inventiveness of Eminems CDs but todays studio films take far fewer artistic chances than their mainstream music counterparts. Beneath its streetwise surface 8 Mile lays on the old Hollywood hokum giving us an idealized Eminem who is devoted to his little sister defends the gay guy at work gets treated badly by women (who are all as we know duplicitous hos) and wins his fistfights unless hes outnumbered. Eminems not so much cleaning out his closet as cleaning it up. (Even his mom gets a moment of redemption.) What saves all this from being purely conventional is the filmmakers keen sense of Rabbits essential solitude as an artist even when surrounded by friends. 8 Mile doesnt end on the anticipated note of triumph but with the awareness that to become fully himself Rabbit must walk Detroits mean streets alone losing himself -- as his new anthem has it -- in the music the moment.Brian De Palma has always tended to lose himself in perverse contradictions marrying an unabashed enthusiasm for trash -- he loves choreographing violence and undressing women often in the same scene -- to a highly abstract sense of cinematic high style. Its for just this reason that Martin Amis memorably remarked that De Palmas work appeals to the film-nerd and the hooligan but no one in between. I havent admired a De Palma film since Carrie or even enjoyed one since Scarface so it must mean something that Femme Fatale gave me one of the best times at the movies Ive had this year.De Palma leaves his calling card in the very first shot which shows our fatal femme Laure played by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos reflected in a TV screen as she watches Double Indemnity. Within moments were at a red-carpet screening at Cannes and shes plunged into a byzantine heist involving stun guns power blackouts a skimpy outfit made of diamonds lesbian sex in a toilet and naturally a big double cross. A self-described ""bad girl rotten to the core"" Laure spends the rest of the movie in Paris fleeing the repercussions of the robbery a hallucinatory process that gets her involved with vengeful crooks an American ambassador to France a hapless if handsome paparazzo (Antonio Banderas) and a distraught woman whos more than just Laures body double -- theyre dead ringers.De Palma has always been enthralled by Vertigo and just as James Stewarts Scotty sought to turn Kim Novaks Judy into his idealized Madeleine so De Palma has spent much of his career (most overtly in Obsession) invoking the ghost of Hitchcocks masterpiece. Hes at it again in Femme Fatale whose spiraling plotline feels positively unhinged -- but this time the obsession pays off. His champions used to claim that De Palmas films werent simply filled with scenes of sex and violence but were self-consciously about such scenes -- a commentary on storytelling -- yet his ostentatious set-pieces and camera moves couldnt disguise the unselfconscious seaminess at the core of Dressed To Kill or Body Double. Audiences sensed that the director cared more for his style than for his characters or worse that he got turned on watching his female characters being violated or slaughtered. Here De Palma upends his reflexive penchant for violence against women -- Laure is running the show -- and though he clearly digs stripping off her clothing and showing her in chick-on-chick action for once the sleaze feels genuinely playful. This movie really is about storytelling with startling twists and noir-subverting turns set up with numerous sly clues. (Rather than betray its secrets Id simply ask you to imagine Mulholland Drive played as comedy.)A deliberately disreputable romp Femme Fatale asks us to lose ourselves in its lighthearted treats be it the cocky expression on a models face as she slinks near-naked through the Palais at Cannes or Banderas playing queeny to trick his way into a hotel room (hes one of our great screen comedians) or even the fillip of having Peter Coyote play a nice guy (perhaps doing those voice-overs for Claritin has clarified his soul). The great revelation is Romijn-Stamos who until now most notably as the X-Mens Mystique has been known less as a screen actress than as a hot bod. Here Romijn-Stamos the actress neatly carries the picture. Shes mean funny ingenuously disingenuous and in a ravishing striptease near the end of the picture so absurdly sexy that its both punishing and goofy. The girl knows her way around a wisecrack and Femme Fatale may do for her what Basic Instinct did for Sharon Stone. Which is to say its hard not to love an actress who will gleefully snap ""You dont have to lick my ass. Just fuck me.""I dont know about you but put that line on a poster and Im there.8 MILE | Directed by CURTIS HANSON | Written by SCOTT SILVER | Produced by HANSON BRIAN GRAZER and JIMMY IOVINE | Released by Universal Pictures | CitywideFEMME FATALE | Written and directed by BRIAN DE PALMA Produced by TARAK BEN AMMAR and MARINA GEFTER Released by Warner Bros. | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For a superstar known as a ticking time bomb Eminem is a surprisingly savvy businessman. While his pop-chart peers Britney Spears and Mariah Carey broke into film with vehicles that cemented their status as walking punchlines Eminem assembled outstanding collaborators for his own debut 8 Mile which comes closer to Mike Leighs grim working-class realism than Hype Williams flashiness. Directed by Curtis Hanson co-edited by Jay Rabinowitz and shot by Amores Perros cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto 8 Mile stars Eminem as an aspiring rapper choking on the poverty stale air and broken dreams of his trailer-park life. To dull the pain of their rudderless existence he and his friends drive around smoke pot burn down abandoned buildings and generally behave like multicultural Midwestern versions of the kids from Saturday Night Fever another bleak working-class character study driven by a mesmerizing central star turn. But where John Travolta found escape on the dance floor Eminem finds salvation and redemption in battle-rapping a take-no-prisoners form of lyrical combat that places a heavy emphasis on improvisation and crowd reaction. Brittany Murphy co-stars as Eminems unpredictable and pragmatic quasi-love interest an aspiring model who sees him as her way out of Detroit but who seems willing to hitch her fortunes to somebody else in case he doesnt work out. Effortlessly authentic in its depiction of working-class despair and the hope engendered by hip-hops promise of upward social mobility 8 Mile brings to the forefront the lower-class anger bubbling just under the surface of Eminems music. On a superficial level 8 Mile is essentially Rocky by way of Purple Rain. Scott Silvers script follows a familiar arc that takes the rapper from humiliation and self-doubt to triumph and self-confidence but the films absolute conviction keeps it from feeling formulaic. By this point even blue-haired grandmas will realize that the Eminem saga doesnt end with the rapper working at McDonalds and sharing a basement apartment with Vanilla Ice but 8 Mile plunges so deep into the hopelessness of its setting that his success never feels preordained. Since his ascension to pop-culture royalty Eminem has transformed the messy emotions of his life into musical black comedy. In 8 Mile that life becomes an equally riveting drama.

"At the movies 8 Mile 110802 - The Augusta Chronicle Augusta Chronicle   | CC News Times   | Augusta.com   | Augusta Real Estate   | Augusta Autos   | Augusta Jobs   | Apartment Finder Site Web At the movies 8 Mile By Christy Lemire| Associated Press Friday November 08 2002 Say what you will about Eminem - that hes a misogynist and a homophobe that his profane violent rhymes taint the young minds of his fervent followers. The man has undeniable charisma so it comes as no surprise that he proves he can act in ""8 Mile"" his film debut. After all Slim Shady - or whatever he calls himself when he raps about killing his ex-wife and stuffing her body in a trunk - is nothing but an act a side show for shock value. What does come as a surprise is the softer side of Marshall Mathers III - that beneath the bravado there is vulnerability. He wasnt afraid to turn himself into a sympathetic figure and by doing so hes turned himself into a movie star. True ""8 Mile"" pretty much follows Eminems life story He stars as Jimmy Smith Jr. - ""Rabbit"" to his friends - a white kid from a poor black neighborhood in Detroit who immerses himself in rap culture as an escape from his alcoholic mother and dead-end factory job. Rabbit hangs out with his childhood friends falls for a wannabe model named Alex (Brittany Murphy) and hones his skills hoping to snag a recording deal that will take him far from the decrepitude of the citys 8 Mile Road. But as Mariah Carey infamously proved last year with ""Glitter"" not all pop stars are comfortable standing in front of a camera and playing thinly veiled versions of themselves. Where Carey was stiff and self-conscious Eminem is positively magnetic. It certainly doesnt hurt that he has Curtis Hanson on his side. The ""L.A. Confidential"" director found the perfect balance between giving Eminem room to swagger and reining in the rappers rage. The result Its as if Eminem isnt even acting. Hansons stylistic approach to ""8 Mile"" is just as natural; its so raw its practically a Dogma 95 film. With cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (""Amores Perros"") hes stripped down the images to grainy grays and blues bathed them in natural light and shot them mostly with hand-held cameras. The look enhances Eminems innate immediacy with his steely blue eyes and no-nonsense lyrics. The power of his performance is enough to make you forgive the fact that ""8 Mile"" is essentially a rap version of ""The Karate Kid"" with Eminem in the Ralph Macchio role. Mekhi Phifer is his Mr. Miyagi and a bunch of rich rappers who cruise around Detroit in a plush SUV fill in for the dreaded Cobra Kai karate students. So we know that after coming up lame in his first rap battle against his rivals Rabbit must return to the same stage at the end to emerge victorious. Theres so much noise and fun and energy to the climax though it doesnt matter that we saw it coming from the opening credits. Despite the predictable formula screenwriter Scott Silver wisely avoids taking the easy route every time; there are several small twists you may not expect and the ending isnt entirely a happy one. If there is a weak link its Kim Basinger as Rabbits mother. Hanson worked wonders with Basinger in ""L.A. Confidential"" the film that earned her a supporting-actress Oscar; here shes singularly shrill and selfish. Murphy is a joy to watch though as she has been consistently in scene-stealing supporting roles from ""Clueless"" to ""Riding in Cars With Boys."" But to paraphrase an Eminem song it would feel so empty without him. Thankfully since hes in practically every frame of the movie we never have to know what thats like. ""8 Mile"" a Universal Films release is rated R for strong language sexuality some violence and drug use. Running time 111 minutes. Three stars out of four.

Comments (2) 8 Mile This energetic and often exciting feature from Curtis Hanson (L.A. Confidential Wonder Boys) set in Detroit in 1995 aims to be the kind of showcase for Eminem and hip-hop that Saturday Night Fever was for John Travolta and disco and in most respects it succeeds. Hanson depicts a far grungier world brimming with aggression and homophobia and one might argue that his version of the working-class ""success"" story is a lot more honest about the interracial underpinnings and sexual undercurrents of its music and milieu and at least as frank about the desperate need for some kind of transcendence. The movie has some of the braggadocio of its white-trash hero building to its competitive climax as if it were a gladiatorial sporting event and it carried me all the way. With Kim Basinger Mekhi Phifer and Brittany Murphy; Scott Silver wrote the well-honed script. 118 min.

Like Eminem Jimmy Smith Jr. a.k.a. Rabbit is a young angry white rapper trying to make a name for himself in a black world. A dirt-poor Detroit factory worker living with his trailer-trash mom (Kim Basinger) his little sister (Chloe Greenfield) and his moms slacker boy-friend (Michael Shannon) Rabbit takes the stage on Friday nights in brutal one-on-one rap battles where the competitors shred each other with impromptu insults and the victor goes on to the next round. Rap is his only hope of escape from his ravaged neighborhood and his pals root him on hoping they can piggyback out of the ghetto on his coattails.But Eminem if you know his ferocious fluent combative and slippery songs is a master of personas. Eminem/Slim Shady/Marshall Mathers hes got many names and speaks in many voices. Rabbit softens the roughest edges of the Eminem legend--the misogyny is gone and hes pointedly gay-friendly here. He may have anger-management issues but hes the responsible one in his family and his baby sister brings out his sweet maternal side. Movie-wise viewers may recognize Rabbit as a descendant of those 30s working-class heroes played by Jimmy Cagney and John Garfield soulful tough guys fighting their way out of the slums. Its too early to place Eminem alongside those Hollywood giants but the promise is there. He understands the power of being still in front of a camera. Compact volatile and burningly intense hes got charisma to spare.""8 Mile"" is much more than a vanity project. Credit producer Brian Grazer with the smart idea of handing the directing reins to Curtis Hanson and not some flashy MTV type. Hanson (""L.A. Confidential"") has a wonderful sense of humanity; one of the triumphs of the movie is the funny lived-in sense of camaraderie between Rabbit and his makeshift family of friends Future (Mekhi Phifer) clumsy white boy Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones) fat and sassy Sol George (Omar Benson Miller) and activist DJ Iz (DeAngelo Wilson). Brittany Murphy gives a sharp sexy performance as Rabbits ambitious girlfriend Alex and a de-glammed Basinger imbues the immature selfish mother with a fine pathos. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week ""8 Mile"" tells a simple story of perseverance and triumph that borders on the generic. The script by Scott Silver is clumsy and un-inspired when its just advancing the plot. But Hanson and his ensemble keep it real life-size and rooted in the funk of the hollowed-out Detroit streets. The movie builds steadily to its exhilarating climax at the rap battle where Rabbit--and Eminem--strut their best stuff. At its best ""8 Mile"" illuminates the culture out of which rap springs at once an art form provocation and survival mechanism.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"Eminem Made Me a Believer Hes James Dean Not Elvis | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Eminem Made Me a Believer Hes James Dean Not Elvis By Andrew Sarris  11/25/02 1200am Curtis Hansons 8 Mil e from a screenplay by Scott Silver has provided me with my brightest and most surprising pop-music epiphany since the Beatles in Richard Lester and Alun Owens A Hard Days Night shook up all my critical preconceptions 38 years ago and made me proclaim A Hard Days Night ""the Citizen Kane of jukebox movies"" thus earning me immortality as a clue on the board game Trivial Pursuit. Anyway Eminem is the Man here though Im not sure he can play anything or anyone else as convincingly and as stirringly as he plays Jimmy Smith Jr. known in the movie as Rabbit an obvious stand-in for Marshall Mathers III/Eminem himself. Jimmy the Rabbit hails from the wrong side of 8 Mile Road which separates Detroits blighted mostly black inner city from its affluent predominantly white suburbs. Mr. Hanson deserves a great deal of credit for the straightforward non-gimmicky method he has used to articulate the rap duels in 8 Mile . Instead of resorting to MTV-type camera pyrotechnics with an editing rhythm synchronized to the pulse-quickening drum beat of the rap accompaniment he has chosen to slowly glide with a handheld camera into a sustained contemplation of the faces the postures and the varying confrontational ""attitudes"" of both the rapper and his challenger who is scrupulously silent until it is his turn to retaliate with his own rap. Truth to tell Im still not a rap enthusiast even temporarily. I dont really get it musically and I probably never will. I had never listened to an Eminem recording before I saw 8 Mile  though I had patiently endured some African-American hip-hop performers on the unexpurgated Chris Rock stand-up comedy show on cable television and I remained unmoved. This was not the case when I first encountered the girl-cherishing Beatles and the joyous Motown sound of Diana Ross and the Supremes. Though I dont believe that hip-hop represents the end of civilization as we know it I have never grooved on the anger and biliousness of the lyrics. Perhaps I lead a much-too-privileged existence as a member of a much-too-privileged race. Yet Eminem has gotten to me as a screen presence in a way that Elvis himself with his similar proclivity for black music-rhythm and blues rather than rap-never did. Indeed I have to go back to James Dean in Elia Kazans East of Eden and Nicholas Rays Rebel Without a Cause in 1955 to find a comparably jolting piece of male aggressiveness coupled with bottled-up vulnerability. But Eminems Jimmy Jr. unlike Deans characters is not yearning for some inaccessible parental approval understanding or stability. What Jimmy is trying to do is break out of the hellhole of his environment by mastering and cashing in on the musical idiom of his black friends enemies and fellow slum-dwellers. His is but the latest version of the hyper-individualized American Dream memorialized in Frank Sinatras rendition of ""My Way"" an American adaptation of a French chanson with less grandiose connotations. To get to the top Jimmy Jr. doesnt feel the need to gain the love of a good woman. He has tried half-heartedly on two occasions first with Janeane (Taryn Manning) who may or may not be pregnant and who may or may not be faithful but who has time on her hands to be sure and then with Alex (Brittany Murphy) a wannabe model who immediately cheats on Jimmy to get ahead. After confirming his manhood by beating up Alexs seducer Jimmy walks away from the relationship and resumes his solo march to his success-driven destiny. What is truly impressive about Jimmy Jr. is his refusal to compromise his rock-solid white identity and morph into one of Norman Mailers ""White Negroes."" Here theres a fortuitous coincidence at work in the grim inexpressiveness of Eminems stone-faced countenance. The intensity of his characters withholding is the secret source of his psychic strivings. The self-absorbed Jimmy is redeemed for audiences by his unstinting love for his adorable 5-year-old sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield) and his loyalty to his gay hanger-on Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones). As for his slatternly marginally alcoholic mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger) Jimmy is kind to her to the extent that he doesnt self-pityingly scorn and reject her-even when she takes on as her latest love Jimmys high-school classmate Greg Buehl (Michael Shannon). In this volatile domestic cauldron Mr. Hanson and Mr. Silver have kept the disruptive dysfunctionality from exploding into a police chase. Such an explosion would have reduced the dramatic impact of the climactic rap duel between Jimmy and Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie). Jimmy wins the contest after an embarrassing failure of nerve in a previous duel by a shrewdly confessional strategy that leaves his opponent with no talking points. This masterly maneuver worthy of a Caesar or a Napoleon compensates for the lack of suspense in this formulaic situation. Mr. Hanson is on an impressive winning streak with his three successfully seriocomic sagas of moral and existential survival in hothouses of social pathology  L.A. Confidential (1997) with its police wrongdoing; Wonder Boys (2000) with its academic dysfunction; and now 8 Mile  with its backdrop of the neglect and abandonment of the urban poor. Despite Rabbits rhetoric about making it alone he is the beneficiary of a tradition forged out of the misery of many other people. ""Independence"" is a middle-class shibboleth since the fact is that we are each of us dependent on many other human beings. Rabbit may ""make it"" just as Marshall Mathers III turned into Eminem and ""made it"" but it will be as part of a parade even if hes marching at the very front. Anti-Clericalism in Mexico Carlos Carreras El Crimen del Padre Amaro  from a screenplay by Vincente Lenero has been adapted from an 1875 novel with the same title by the Portuguese author Jose Maria Eca de Queiroz. Though the novel is set in a small 19th-century Mexican village this ""period"" subject has been updated for the screen with cars buses drive-by criminal gangs and drug lords. But the central theme priestly violations of the Catholic Churchs code of celibacy could have been inspired by recent headlines of clerical misbehavior. In any event El Crimen del Padre Amaro has been a runaway box-office success in Mexico but its still scrambling here. The Mexican Catholic Church has already petitioned the Mexican President to ban the film outright-thus far unsuccessfully-but I hate to think what our own right-to-life President would think of a film that deals with the perils of back-alley abortions. Still I find it interesting that American film producers have stayed away from any subject dealing with priestly misbehavior while a recent Law and Order episode on network television confronted the subject head-on with sensitivity and fair-mindedness. El Crimen del Padre Amaro deals with other forms of institutional corruption besides the abuse of underage parishioners. These morally questionable acts include deals with a narco-chieftain to pay for a needed hospital with laundered drug money and the excommunication of a priest practicing idealistic liberation theology who has been branded a subversive supporter of Communist guerrillas when he refuses to transfer to a convent where he will be far from the impoverished people he wishes to serve. The issue of homosexuality in the priesthood however is never even mentioned as if it were unthinkable in the midst of Mexican machismo . The lead role of Father Amaro a recently ordained 24-year-old priest sent to a small parish church in Los Reyes Mexico is played by Mexican matinee idol Gael Garcia Bernal. From the outset Mr. Bernals Father Amaro with his seemingly guileless smile struck me as much too narcissistically self-approving to be capable of any genuinely altruistic acts. At first my estimation seemed wrong as Father Amaro gives some money outright to an elderly fellow passenger who has lost his lifes savings to a band of bus robbers. But soon Amaro shows his true colors when he allows himself to be seduced by 16-year-old Amelia (Ana Claudia Talancon) a beautiful girl whose widowed mother Sanjuanera (Angelica Aragon) has been sleeping with Father Benito (Sancho Gracia) Father Amaros superior. When Amelia becomes pregnant and reluctantly agrees to an abortion to save Father Amaros career he drives her-disillusioned with his craven behavior as she is-to the abortionist whose botched procedure causes her to bleed to death. This I suppose is Father Amaros ""crime"" for which he manages to escape blame and punishment. But its only the tip of the iceberg of his iniquities which include dishonesty treachery cruelty cowardice hypocrisy and venality. In short hes a monster of unbridled ambition without scruples-and most damning of all to the church he seems to be a model for a successful priestly career. This is anti-clericalism with a vengeance of a type almost unknown here in America where people are more squeamishly pious than genuinely religious. Audrey Tautou Pouts Her Way Into My Heart Pascale Baillys God Is Great Im Not  from a screenplay by Ms. Bailly and Alain Tasma is a movie that slowly creeps up on you after a series of start-and-stop scenes punctuated with blackouts that prevent any narrative rhythm from emerging out of the indecisive encounters of a group of unresolved characters. Gradually a young gamine named Michele (Audrey Tautou) manages to break away from the amorphous pack to pair off with a Jewish veterinarian named Francois (Edouard Baer). She is 20 years old; hes 32. Shes determined to find something new to believe in beyond her mothers tired ritualized Catholicism and so she decides to become Jewish in order to combine her soul with his-or rather with what she assumes to be in Francois soul. He quickly assures her that he is completely irreligious even though hes the son of Holocaust survivors who yearn to see their Jewishness reaffirmed in Francois future children. Ms. Bailly dances over these touchy subjects and problematic relationships with a casual indefiniteness that enables Ms. Tautou to display the full range of her silent-movie-like virtuosity mostly through her sparkling eyes and pouting-princess balletic grace. I am convinced she can do anything and I recommend the movie almost solely because of her. This is a considerable change of attitude on my part; I successfully resisted Ms. Tautous charms in Jean-Pierre Jeunets wildly overrated Amelie (2001) her biggest hit thus far. I have liked Ms. Tautou though not Amelie  much more since. Thats just the way it is.

"8 Mile is a rap-star Rocky. Slate Sign In Sign Up 8 Mile is a rap-star Rocky. 8 Mile is a rap-star Rocky. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 8 2002 1038 AM Chocolate City 8 Mile is a rap-star Rocky. By David Edelstein Eminem loses himself as Rabbit There are a lot of stale--and nefarious--cliches in 8 Mile (Universal) but most of the time theyre overwhelmed by the pulsing grinding hopped-up camerawork and the soulful star turn of Eminem. This is basically a new-style boxing movie only the matches happen in a giant industrial warehouse in Detroit called the Shelter and the punches are the lyrics--or more accurately the rhyming insults--of the raps. Eminem is ""B. Rabbit"" the underdog the lone white rapper to take the microphone and a victim of sniggering racism. Hes called ""hillbilly"" ""trailer-trash"" and most damningly ""Vanilla Ice."" But Rabbit isnt alone with his white self He has a motley posse of black and semi-black homeys who buck him up and tell him hes the man dog. Or is it the dog man? Whatever the white hero needs African-American friends or the movie would pose some problems for its intended audience the millions of teenagers of all races who dress and talk like inner-city blacks. Advertisement Eminem has a good camera face--at once soft and hard woozy and defiant like a punk Robert Mitchum (with whom he shares a cleft chin). Hes tender with his kid sister and courtly with his desperately poor and lonely mom (a disheveled Kim Basinger hitting some great notes of drunken grief). He sits on a bus with a drum track coming out of his headphones scrawling raps in a tiny hand on folded-up pieces of paper. When he arrives at the site of his matches he swivels his baseball cap from back to front then pulls his hood over his head and lopes into the arena where he holds the gaze of sundry sneering blacks. Its too bad that when Eminem actually starts to rap he loses his Mitchum cool and seems more or less indistinguishable from his opponents. On his CDs his rhymes are often riotously belligerent but his sincerity in the rest of the movie works against him here. Eminem is more fun as an unprovoked asshole. And whose idea was it to rhyme ""pussy"" and ""tushy""? The director Curtis Hanson gets more and more resourceful. 8 Mile (the name is for the avenue that divides inner-city Detroit from the suburbs) is shot in a sympathetic fever with the perfect mix of rage and sadness at the blue-lit ruins of urban Detroit--a ghost town in which signs of life often turn out to be death-rattles. At its best the movie presents a universe in which everyone raps for his or her dignity A competition even breaks out in the lunch-truck line at the plant where the hero works. (John Wayne-like Rabbit comes to the rescue of a middle-aged woman who has been out-rapped.) The movie is at its most retro whenever Brittany Murphy shows up in her red-leather minis and fish-net stockings to tempt the hero away from the work he must do. Murphy is a terrific actress It will be a shame if she becomes a star via this embarrassing siren turn. That said she has it. When she turned those huge black-rimmed eyes on Rabbit she made me think of Morris Days line to Apollonia in Purple Rain (1984) ""Your lips would make a lollipop too happy.""

But in 8 Mile he does himself proud with a director whos accumulating one. Coming off the glossily corrosive L.A. Confidential and the whimsical Wonder Boys Curtis Hanson has fashioned a dynamic Detroit-based saga about showbiz upward mobility -- though to the credit of both movie and filmmaker not that upward. More on the movie 8 Mile (out of four) Stars Eminem Kim Basinger Brittany Murphy Mekhi Phifer Director Curtis Hanson Distributor Universal Rating R for strong language sexuality some violence and drug use As if it werent tough enough being an aspiring white rapper Jimmy (Eminem) finds himself living back in a trailer with his mom after having just lost his girlfriend. But because his mom is played by Kim Basinger shes not just a mom; her new live-in boyfriend (Michael Shannon) is about Jimmys age. Basinger manages to convince us this woman could pull off the feat even though she looks as if life long ago wore her out. Jimmy stamps metal by day and eyeballs a modeling hopeful (Brittany Murphy) who pops into the factory and flips him an affectionate finger. But by night he competes in rapping contests staged in earthy venues that appear to be one or two steps down from the joint where Tobey Maguires Spider-Man fought his wrestling match. In his first contest Jimmy freezes and the stigma lingers despite backing from black buddy Future (Mekhi Phifer). White rappers and black rappers arent exactly predestined to be pals and its refreshing to see not just cross-racial friendships but also animosities based on nothing more than the fact that individuals simply dont like each other. The rap sequences are shot and edited with the excitement of a crisply broadcast sporting event which in a way they are. Eminem may be a success in real life but you dont get the sense that anyone here will break out and bankroll mansions or hot cars (though in Detroit you could probably get a deal). The victories here will be small on the world stage but immense in self-esteem terms. Eminem steals the picture from a cast with snap down to the smallest parts. An argument could be made for Basinger however who looms so poignantly with not-quite-faded beauty but totally faded prospects. Hanson not doubt will rank near the top of her Christmas card list; he guided her to a Confidential Oscar and could steer her to another nomination here.

Directed by Curtis Hanson from a screenplay by Scott Silver. 111 minutes. Rated R for strong language sexuality some violence and drug use. Several theaters. Curtis Hansons ""8 Mile"" a k a ""The Eminem Movie"" has a very old-fashioned story at its throbbing heart -- and therein lies its appeal. Yes there are the grungy hip-hop clubs the grim trailer parks and the couple who express their feelings for each other by flashing a middle finger but deep down this is a recognizable tale. A young man with a special talent rises from poor and humble surroundings -- hmm can you hum a few bars of that one? But the triumph here is that Hanson (director of the wonderful ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Wonder Boys"") and screenwriter Scott Silver have found a fresh way to tell this story. From the chilly streets of Detroit Hanson and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto create a world thats mesmerizing in both its otherness and its familiarity and from rapper Eminem Hanson gets the years least likely star turn. Not that multiplatinum recording artist Marshall Mathers is much of an actor at least not yet. But hes something even rarer a genuine presence onscreen a pale face under a knit cap with wide-open eyes that register everything and from which we cant look away. Like Madonna in ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" -- the only movie to truly capture her lazy fox-eyed allure -- he brings to his screen debut the confidence of an already-established star shambling around in his baggy clothes like a not-quite-lost boy. (Let us hope that Eminem 20 years down the line does not have a remake of ""Swept Away"" in the works.) Loosely based on Eminems personal story ""8 Mile"" is a few days in the life of Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr. a tightly wound loser whos lost his job and lives in a trailer park with his party-girl mom (Kim Basinger looking flushed and weary) and angelic little sister Lily (tiny Chloe Greenfield). He halfheartedly begins a new job at New Detroit Stamping -- a deafening factory where machines crunch metal as if chewing on bones -- and wanders the streets with his friends working up his nerve to enter a rap contest. He chokes badly in one and finally triumphs in another the first step were left to conclude toward fame. It could be argued that the film presents something of an apology for Eminem whose music has created controversy because of hate-filled lyrics directed toward women and homosexuals. Indeed ""8 Mile"" is careful to show Jimmy rapping in defense of a gay co-worker and to establish the characters loving relationship with little Lily. But this is the story of Jimmy not Marshall and like any movie it lives in a world of its own. And that world is a cold one in every sense of the word. The characters despite their layered attire always seem to be shivering; the streets have a bombed-out quality welcoming no one. In the hip-hop clubs the audience stands massed together like spectators awaiting the entrance of the gladiators. Lighting is dim colors are grayed; theres no comfort anywhere. Though Jimmy as a white face at a hip-hop club is an anomaly his world is an easily integrated one. His buddies both black and white are all ""broke and living with our moms"" -- theyre all in the same dingy boat and the camaraderie within the benign posse feels funny and real. And while hes first mocked by the black audience at the club where he freezes at the mike he eventually wins them over. ""Once they hear you"" says Jimmys friend Future (Mekhi Phifer charismatic in dreadlocks) ""it wont matter what color you are."" Its a story more about class than race. While Eminem dominates the film Hanson draws fine work from all his cast especially Basinger. As Stephanie Jimmys run-down trailer-park mom shes all raw emotion -- screaming in pain desperate pleading giddy optimism. Basinger who hasnt been this good since her Oscar-winning performance in ""L.A. Confidential"" (What exactly does Hanson know that other directors dont?) lets herself look frowsy and tired showing us a foolishly self-absorbed mother but letting us see glimpses of how she got that way. And Brittany Murphy her blond hair flipping around her head like a sunbeam is radiant as Alex a girl determined to leave Detroit but more than willing to dally with Jimmy in the meantime. But the movie belongs to Eminem and to the harsh and funny rhythms of rap poetry. In one irresistible scene he and Future try to get his car started and improvise a bitterly hilarious rap to ""Sweet Home Alabama"" (played in the trailer by Stephanies slimy boyfriend). Eminem and Phifer riff together grinning with pleasure when finding the perfect rhyme. Its a scene weve seen often -- two young artists blending in happy collaboration -- but never quite like this and it has a gritty magic of its own.

Who knows? But his star turn in ""8 Mile"" as an aspiring rapper growing up poor and white in Motown is memorable -- even if weve seen it all before. Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News There are 8 million stories in the naked city a number so paralyzing that you can understand why Hollywood keeps filming the same half dozen or so. But one of the pleasures of moviegoing -- or of following any form of art -- is watching the passing parade of variations on the same old themes. Curtis Hansons ""8 Mile"" a not-really-but-kind-of biography of Eminem in which the rapper himself stars is straightforward rudimentary old-fashioned moviemaking cranking away in the service of a story weve seen over and over again from ""Rebel Without a Cause"" to ""Saturday Night Fever."" But ""8 Mile"" actually seems to be straining against originality. Hanson along with screenwriter Scott Silver and Eminem himself seems more interested in poking a sharpened stick at age-old primal motivations. At once creaky and compelling ""8 Mile"" is an early-21st-century meditation on the youthful dream (or necessity) of making yourself heard and getting away fast from the roots that threaten to strangle you. The movie takes some of the vitality of 40s youth musicals and retools them for a new generation ""Lets put on a show"" is followed by the even more urgent coda ""and then get the hell out of here."" For better or worse -- and maybe in the end it doesnt really matter all that much -- ""8 Mile"" is far less sophisticated than Eminems music itself As a performer Eminem is a master of point of view an artist who puts himself (and his reputation) at the mercy of the characters he creates. When fancy-pants novelists do that they win big prizes; when hip-hop artists do it theyre decried as the end of civilization. No one needs to weep for Eminem who has sold millions of records and won his share of mainstream music awards. But just because an artist sells millions doesnt mean hes fully understood (if being fully understood is desirable at all). Im a fan of Eminems precisely because I cant explain him easily My inability to get him fully -- as opposed to my approval or disapproval of any of his perceived ""messages"" -- is what keeps me coming back. Hes like a master novelist who writes characters I can neither love nor turn away from the madman drunk with his own Rolling Stone-conferred power in ""Kill You""; the cuckolded husband in ""Kim"" who turns his pain into a reign of terror. We like to think of art as our friend but art -- as Shakespeare or Goya or Bacon would have told you -- isnt always kind. ""8 Mile"" doesnt even begin to explain Eminems complexity. If anything it strips much of it back making him -- through the character he plays Jimmy Smith Jr. or ""Rabbit"" as his friends and family call him -- seem more likable and accessible than he comes off either in interviews or performances. But thats a problem only if you go to ""8 Mile"" looking for clues about how to interpret Eminems work (they wont be there). ""8 Mile"" is much more generic than that -- its about how our backgrounds always inform us maybe even more than we care to let on. And it suggests that the only way to break free of the past is to grab it in an octopus grip and stare it down first. The picture is set in urban Detroit circa 1995 -- the title refers to the area delineated by 8 Mile Road that separates the city from the suburbs. Jimmy is a kid in a dead-end metalworking job whos temporarily forced to move back home with his childish chronically unemployed mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger) and his adored little sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield). That home is a trailer park and Jimmys none too happy about landing there Hes a remarkably talented rapper supported by a solid group of friends although theres a certain amount of insecurity or maybe just plain shyness thats holding him back. What he really wants is to land a recording contract and get out on his own. His best hope is to first win a battle in one of the local hip-hop clubs a competition in which rappers go head-to-head to see who can come up with the cruelest cleverest put-downs. Jimmys chief disadvantage is that hes white; outside his circle of friends hes ridiculed by his mostly black peers. In the movies opening sequence we see him taking the stage at a battle urged on by his friend Future (Mekhi Phifer) only to choke up and fail dismally. His disgrace and disappointment kick-start the picture From there ""8 Mile"" is all about Jimmys efforts to find his voice and to use it as a tool a crowbar to get him out of some pretty dismal circumstances. ""8 Mile"" trots out plenty of the old conventions -- we see Jimmy driving aimlessly around town in a beat-up car with his buddies blasting signs buildings and even police cars with a paint gun; theyre the picture of perennially bored youth. But Hanson understands that those conventions dont have to be tiresome; they can be revitalized every time theres a sea change in youth culture -- in fact its about time someone made a picture like this about hip-hop culture. Hanson (director of ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Wonder Boys"") may seem like an odd fit as a director but he does have a feel for classic modes of storytelling. And hes more interested in people than in topicality; he always takes care to put his characters first. Instead of using them to make blunt statements about poverty or racial tension he lets the rough textures of their lives unfold before us -- any attendant social issues are simply part of the fabric. You Might Also Like He also seems to get that hip-hop battles didnt spring from nowhere Jazz fans know theyre just another version of cutting contests onstage competitions in which musicians would ruthlessly out-improvise each other. Hanson slips right into the rhythm of this particular culture showing how for Jimmy hip-hop isnt something you aspire to but an intensely verbal way of thinking that informs everyday life -- a skill that involves finding the right words for every situation and figuring out on the fly how to piece them together for maximum effect. Hanson captures how freeing and invigorating that process must be showing Jimmy and Future improvising a rhyme (about their own dead-end lives and Jimmys moms stupid boyfriend among other things) to ""Sweet Home Alabama"" mimicking Lynyrd Skynyrds flattened pure-white Southern accents. Hanson builds up slowly to the pictures best and most thrilling sequence the final battle in which Jimmy cuts his opponents to the quick by facing up to the crappiness of his own life and wielding it like a sword. When one guy makes a crack about ""Leave It to Beaver"" a completely undisguised slam at Jimmys whiteness Jimmy turns it against him without batting an eye. He starts out thoughtfully tugging a little against the beat ""Ward I think you were a little hard on the Beaver ..."" and drives it home from there. This improvised routine is less a flurry of invective than a finely shaped argument laced with cultural references that seem to have been grabbed spontaneously from thin air. Its the final argument anyone should ever have to make for hip-hop done well as an art form If you can put the right words together like that and make them swing youre in a very small minority of human beings on this earth because it aint easy. If ""8 Mile"" feels old-fashioned but not outmoded the actors deserve at least some of the credit. Basinger seems to have crawled right into her character Stephanies life is all about screwing her good-for-nothing boyfriend (Michael Shannon) going to bingo and complaining about being broke and not much else least of all caring for her young daughter. It doesnt matter how beautiful Stephanie is (she looks as if she could be Jimmys not-much-older sister) At first you wonder how anyone could let her get away with such laziness and irresponsibility. But Basinger pulls a neat trick on us turning on that milky-sweet Southern accent and reeling us in seductively just when we think weve conveniently written her off. Phifer plays Future as one of those smart good-natured charismatic guys who nevertheless just doesnt have what it takes to become a real success -- its a small but nicely layered performance. Brittany Murphy as the girl Jimmy has a thing for has smudgy round eyes and hair that flares out like a set of unruly bleached angel wings. Murphy knows how to work those looks She comes off as both perpetually lost and preternaturally wise like a Dickensian orphan reimagined by Walter Keane. The big question -- Can Eminem act? -- is one that ""8 Mile"" doesnt answer. But it doesnt have to. There are times when a personality can carry a movie effortlessly and thats what Eminem does here. Hes a purely believable presence. Eminem doesnt reach out toward us. Hes veiled and guarded but even so he reveals flickers of vulnerability. His slightly protruding eyes give him a potent stare; theyre not just a physical characteristic but an explanation for his way of being. Its as if hes taking everything in around him and working overtime to process it as quickly as possible. Eminem is still a mystery and ""8 Mile"" doesnt come close to explaining him. Its probably safe to assume that part of the reason that older more straitlaced white audiences dont respond to hip-hop is because they feel intimidated by the image -- whether its real or merely just perceived -- of the angry black male. So what do we make of an angry white one particularly one like Eminem whos intimidating because of his sheer intensity? When Jimmy a scrawny hunched-over white kid with darting eyes goes head-to-head in a battle of wits (and wit) with a buffed-up black guy in a muscle T-shirt theres no question which character is more unnerving. We just dont know what makes Jimmy or Eminem tick. But we can hear it and sometimes it sounds suspiciously like a heartbeat. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment.

Credit Eli Reed Copyright ... more Photo HANDOUT 8 Mile high / Rapper Eminem succeeds in Rocky-like tale about his own rise to fame 1 / 2 Back to Gallery 8 MILE Drama. Starring Eminem Kim Basinger Brittany Murphy Mekhi Phifer Eugene Byrd Omar Benson Miller and Taryn Manning. Directed by Curtis Hanson. Written by Scott Silver. (R. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Eminems albums all feature parental-advisory labels that warn of the rough language within. The only caution that Eminems new movie should have is for people wholl assume its an offensive foulmouthed sexist violent romp that glorifies abhorrent behavior. ""8 Mile"" is rated R but the movie -- a dramatization of Eminems early rap life -- is more funny than foul more inspiring than infuriating more touching than not. In many ways ""8 Mile"" is a ""Rocky""-like tale of determination and long odds that will appeal even to those who are turned off by most rap music. This is Eminem as hero and Horatio Alger. Are you ready for that America? Eminem begins the movie as an aspiring rapper named Jimmy Smith Jr. who lives with his alcoholic mother (Kim Basinger) in a depressing Detroit trailer park. His future looks grim after he enters a rap contest and freezes when its time to shout out his lines and impress the audience. Related Stories VIDEO OF THE WEEK / 8 Mile portrays Rocky-like Eminem / Rappers rise to fame makes good viewing Called a ""joke"" by the crowd a ""loser"" by his moms abusive boyfriend and doubted by his own mother (""What are you doing with your life thats so good?"" she asks) Eminem works in a factory where the manager doesnt even trust him to show up on time. His ex-girlfriend -- whom he doesnt much like -- is pregnant with his child. Eminems only solaces in ""8 Mile"" are the rhymes he scribbles his precious younger sister (whom he tucks into bed when he can) and the hope that he can one day escape his tenuous existence. His friends are also a big boost. (Their jabbering at each other is hilarious and one of the movies consistent highlights.) In fact more than one of his friends in ""8 Mile"" recognizes Eminems potential as a performer and tries to get him a break that will lead to better things. In the meantime they smoke dope and ride around a decayed Detroit where whole blocks of once-proud homes stand empty and abandoned. ""Were all broke as s-- and living at home with our moms"" Eminem complains. Under the direction of Curtis Hanson (""L.A. Confidential"") and the imagination of screenwriter Scott Silver Eminems fortunes slowly begin to change -- along with his prospects for romance thanks to a shimmering woman named Alex (Brittany Murphy) who quickly becomes his lover. There is violence in ""8 Mile"" but some of it is actually amusing as when Eminems dorky friend tries to put a gun in his pants and accidentally shoots himself. When Eminem administers a beating to a friend who betrays him and to his moms out-of-control boyfriend they almost seem justified. In this Hollywood version of Eminems life the toughest punches and kicks are aimed at the rapper himself -- an attack by a group of toughs and other rappers that makes us root for Eminems character even more. Surprisingly Eminem whose real name is Marshall Mathers III is at times understated and almost soft-spoken in ""8 Mile"" unlike in his albums where he constantly displays anger and mania. In some scenes he just looks out the window of a bus and doesnt say a word his face a study in contemplation and concern. ""8 Mile"" may not showcase the real past life of Eminem who has been arrested for pistol-whipping a man and who for years was roundly criticized because of his anti-gay lyrics. (In ""8 Mile"" Eminem speaks up on behalf of a factory worker whos been dissed as gay.) Sanitized or not ""8 Mile"" shows that this onetime nobody from the poor side of Detroit (the films title refers to the street that divides inner-city Detroit from its suburbs) has the charisma and look to carry his first film. Eminem may not be James Dean or Marlon Brando but in ""8 Mile"" when he yells out ""I am white trash"" or raps ""(When) you live at home in a trailer what the hell are you going to do?"" or stands toe to toe with another rapper in a competition that resembles a boxing match or has sex with Murphys character the scenes come alive with feeling and conviction. He isnt manufacturing these moments as much as hes recalling a recent past -- a past that producers have packaged into a storybook tale complete with a happy ending. . This film contains nudity sex scenes violence and strong language.

"Eminems Big Moment - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Brittany Murphy Eminems Big MomentMovies - REVIEW - 8 MileLike The Song From The 8 Mile Soundtrack The Rapper Captures The Screen And Never Lets It Go.November 8 2002|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticWith his ingenues eyes striking cleft chin and that sculpted puppet nose Eminem has the most camera-ready face to come into movies in ages.The camera doesnt just love that face. It investigates it.Slouching a little his knit cap pulled down on his ears the short slight top-selling rapper makes a stunning film debut in 8 Mile a coming-of-ager from director Curtis Hanson (Wonder Boys L.A. Confidential).Eminems acting is good -- very good. As Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr. the ""trailer-trash"" hero of the new film he handles rage disappointment determination humiliation and more with a simplicity that touches your heart.But its the way he looks that carries the picture. You never question why theres a camera pointed at him.8 Mile which opens today is unfortunately no more than a by-the-book sort of story A young performer attempts to overcome personal adversity to excel in his chosen field.True the new film has a raw hip-hop edge that you wont find in say Elvis 1957 Jailhouse Rock. But allowing for differences in period the themes are roughly the same and the characters are just as thinly drawn.The script by Scott Silver of the abysmal Mod Squad movie lacks nuance character motivation and plausibility. Lame plot devices -- as when one character just happens to win a lot of money -- are all part of the mix.Hanson a sophisticated director uses every trick in the book to work around the scripts shortcomings.One place he stumbles though is in casting Kim Basinger as Rabbits desperate just-scraping-by mom. Theres something intrinsically glamorous in Basingers 40s-style beauty and a kindness in her sad eyes that are all wrong for this lowdown gal.Much better is Mekhi Phifer (TVs ER) who brings such exuberance to his role of the rap impresario Future that his dreadlocks seem to quiver. Brittany Murphy (Dont Say a Word) is alluringly feral as Alex Rabbits love interest and Evan Jones is touching and funny as Cheddar Bob his dim-bulb bud.The title refers to the road in Detroit that divides underclass whites from underclass blacks. But the inescapable issue that Rabbit as a white person is an underdog in the world of rap is raised without really being explored.Set in 1995 the plot concerns what happens when Rabbit newly broken up with his girlfriend returns temporarily to his mothers trailer. To earn money he works at a stamping plant where he spots Alex. Meanwhile Future pleads with Rabbit to enter a contest in which rappers face off on stage by slinging rhymed insults at each other.Rabbit chokes at a similar contest that opens the film. But the climactic quarter-hour face-off is amazing. Even though the words that Rabbit and his opponents speak are probably scripted you can see in the way he marshals his words -- now circling his adversary now pouncing -- that the kid is a natural-born spieler.The movie in fact is really just beginning to take off in that final contest scene when suddenly the storys over. Why are the filmmakers so stingy with this terrific material? Where was this stuff all along?There is granted a funny passage early on in which Rabbit and a friend improvise new words to ""Sweet Home Alabama"" under the title ""Livin Home in a Trailer."" But overall 8 Mile fails to show a connection between Rabbits verbal gifts and his ordinary life.Where is his rapping quick-wittedness when for example he has to deal with his fed-up boss or his mothers nasty boyfriend? Shouldnt he be able to talk his way around or over just about anything?Still 8 Mile is worth a look if only to watch Eminem on the big screen. Even when a films a bit lame its always fun to be there when a star is being born.

Running time 111 minutes. Rated R (violence sex nudity). At the E-Walk the Loews 84th St. the Kips Bay others. PLAYING a character based on himself (though whitewashed for a moviegoing audience) the controversial but unquestionably brilliant rapper Eminem easily carries director Curtis Hansons ""8 Mile."" The film is a star vehicle that hews closer to the plot conventions of sports movies like ""Rocky"" than those of traditional musical biopics. The primary rap performances in the movie are actually sport-like in nature competitive freestyle duels in which pairs of rappers are given 45 seconds to out-insult each other using instantly improvised rhymes. What makes ""8 Mile"" transcend the formulaic nature of its plot is the way it makes these rap competitions compelling even for those unfamiliar with rap music and its scrupulous loving rendition of a grim wintry Detroit circa 1995. And what makes ""8 Mile"" actually fascinating is its depiction of a poor urban America in which issues of race have been submerged by class and diluted by the total cultural triumph of rap. Having recently broken up with his girlfriend Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith (Eminem) lives in a trailer park with his slatternly mom (Kim Basinger) and a little girl (Chloe Greenfield) who could be his daughter but is probably his sister - it isnt entirely clear Mom drinks doesnt work and has recently taken up with one of Rabbits former schoolmates. Sullen but sensitive Rabbit is higher up the social ladder with a job in a factory - though he and his friends a crew that call themselves Three One Third all dream of a better life to be achieved on the back of Rabbits talent. Everyone especially Rabbits best friend Justice (the excellent Mekhi Phifer) believes hes a genius. The problem is he chokes in his first major competition and loses his confidence. Rabbit is also one of those movie heroes who is difficult insensitive and unfair to his friends for no good reason - so much so that when he gets a beating part of you thinks he damn well deserves it. Before he competes again and triumphs over his various demons Rabbit has to undergo several humiliations - including one at the hands of Alex (sexy Brittany Murphy). Shes a local would-be model sufficiently impressed by his charisma and talent to hook up with him in a comically gratuitous and improbable workplace sex scene. The most enjoyable scenes in ""8 Mile"" until Rabbit goes back onstage for the climactic battle are the ones in which the lead character is driving around the blasted city with his best friends (Phifer Evan Jones Omar Benson Miller and DeAngelo Wilson) shooting the breeze shooting paintballs out of the car window and getting into mild trouble. Eminem is no Madonna Hes perfectly convincing within a limited range as you would expect from his performances in music video and on record. Its only when he shares screen time with the excellent Phifer that his acting seems thin. His verbal virtuosity in the rap duels on the other hand is extremely impressive. Kim Basinger sad to say is woefully unconvincing as trailer trash - her perfect Hollywood haircut doesnt help. Scripted by Scott Silver (making up for ""The Mod Squad"") the film is beautifully photographed by Rodrigo Prieto (""Frida"" ""Amores Perros"").

Off screen Eminem aka Slim Shady aka Marshall Mathers (his real name) is an electric figure a quick-witted rhymer reveling in outrageousness and rebellion. His movie however is leaden. Its so determinedly mainstream it drains the life out of what should be a bracing tale. 8 Mile isnt anywhere near as inventive or bold -- or for that matter fun -- as Eminems raps. Its been stamped into an all-purpose mold. The subject is postmodern but the movies style is ... the filmmakers would call it classic. For this story it feels downright antiquated. This seems to be by design. Director Curtis Hanson with L.A. Confidential and The Wonder Boys to his credit knows what hes doing. The producer is Brian Grazer Ron Howards longtime partner. Grazer is incapable of making a movie that isnt targeted at white-bread America. 8 Mile has a hip-hop beat but marches as if to a dirge. Even more unfortunate is the way Grazer and Hanson have chosen to tell this tale which is undergirded by sensitive issues of race and class in the broad form of the Hollywood biopic which is prone to hero worship no matter how many blemishes it may show. 8 Mile is about a suffering artist overcoming adversity and finding his voice. It doesnt deal with the thorny issues it raises except to cast them as obstacles for the hero to overcome. To Eminems array of personas now add Jimmy Smith aka Bunny Rabbit 8 Miles sullen young man an outsider in whatever crowd hes with. Rabbit is exalted by his circle of friends. Standing before a Detroit crowd to compete in the underground battles in which rappers earn their reps frightens him however as it should. His is pretty much the only white face in the room certainly the only one on stage and heat-packing thugs keep calling him names. The only other white people who register in this world are the women in his life particularly Alex (Brittany Murphy) a zombie-eyed wraith who is at least as determined as Rabbit to make good only with no skills to speak of save sex. As if his isolation isnt enough to make Rabbit sullen hes also struggling at home. Hes broken up with his live-in girlfriend for reasons never explained. Hes ashamed to admit it but hes moved back into the trailer with his mom (Kim Basinger) and sister on the outskirts of town. His mom drinks too much. Worse shes shacked up with a violent jerk a few years older than Rabbit. Eminem glides through so many personas on his CDs youd think acting would be second nature. Hes respectable here. Hes particularly good at projecting an air of sulkiness. His mystique is the films selling point but the story would be better served by having a real actor in the role. The film attempts to take us on an emotional journey but Eminem doesnt know how to shape a performance that takes us along for the ride. As far as acting the heavy lifting is done by Basinger and Mekhi Phifer as Rabbits stalwart buddy a fellow rap warrior. Basinger a limited actress won an Oscar for her work in L.A. Confidential and shes better here. The movie is another example of Eminem playing with personas the way he does in his songs. He is Rabbit. Then again he isnt. 8 Mile is a carefully crafted fictionalized biography. Its like the books politicians put out before they run for president. Whether because of Grazers habit or Eminems desires its designed to make us feel good about the protagonist. Enough of the story mirrors Eminems life that we feel were witnessing the truth. But who needs truth? All we want is an entertaining story. 8 Mile is entertaining to an extent. Our enjoyment is muted because the movie has an agenda. The only question is what office is Eminem running for? If we view the film as an advertisement for the rapper what is it selling? It establishes that hes authentic. He came out of Detroits urban wasteland growing up in both black and white cultures and rap is a true expression of who he is. He combats the image that hes homophobic in two scenes in which he befriends and defends a gay co-worker. It presents him as dedicated to his art. One of the refreshing things about the film is that it isnt a story about the hip-hop music business but about the art of hip-hop. Race and class are the subjects of an increasing number of teen dramas. Black and White O Save the Last Dance Crazy/Beautiful Finding Forrester and others grapple with race straightforwardly and with an honesty so-called ""adult"" movies rarely attempt perhaps because young people of different races and ethnicities interact more easily. 8 Mile deals more bluntly with racial exclusion and the struggle for acceptance but it seems oblivious to the sensitive ground on which it treads. Eminem is no Pat Boone who rose to fame doing inferior covers of hits first recorded by blacks or Vanilla Ice whose success was founded primarily on the color of his skin. Eminem is authentic. He has talent. But though his music is embraced by black radio stations and African-American youth blacks remain sensitive about the way black culture has so often been appropriated and exploited at their expense. Rabbit artfully undercuts racist verbal attacks by confronting race before his tormentors can. It works for him. The movie however merely ignores the incendiary subject at its heart. The way its told imparts a Tarzan-King-of-the-Jungle air. Its hard not to see this as being about a white interloper proving his superiority beating the black man at the black mans game.

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 08 2002 1200AM EST Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 135AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English 8 Mile Directed by Curtis Hanson Written by Scott Silver Starring Eminem Kim Basinger Mekhi Phifer Brittany Murphy Classification AA Rating 1/2 Some movies a very few possess the purity of myth and they dont have to be great to be greatly important. The Wild One is an example; Saturday Night Fever is another. Now add 8 Mile to that short list. These films all exude a raw and infectious energy that seems to radiate from several places at once -- from the star from the story and most tellingly from the pop culture that they plunder and so perfectly mythologize. Here of course the star is Eminem and the culture is rap but the story is the same old enduring classic -- the tale of alienated youth of the isolated individual (rugged/sensitive) seeking to rise above his oppressive surroundings and give voice to his uniqueness. Yet there are also significant differences in this case beginning with the obvious fact that Eminem is essentially playing himself -- or at least playing the persona that he has so successfully invented and invested in his music. Its no coincidence that the movies opening shot has him standing alone and rapping quietly into a gritty bathroom mirror -- the man inseparable from his cultivated image the two locked in a narcissistic embrace that blurs fact and fiction. This shot neatly sets the stage for the quasi-autobiography that follows. Its inner-city Detroit 1995 a week in the young life of Rabbit his characters nom de guerre in the rap battles -- a kind of oral boxing -- mounted nightly at a dingy downtown club. Rabbit starts out with a humiliating defeat freezing at the microphone and the rest of the movie is a twinned odyssey of renunciation and redemption -- renouncing everyone and everything around him in order to redeem himself. Thats another difference in this version of the myth. Here the path of redemption leads to the palace of self-reliance -- aint no one to depend on but yourself. The lesson this antihero learns has everything to do with social Darwinism and nothing to do with the social contract -- no loving boost from his hapless family or his shiftless friends or the faceless government or even from a good woman. In that sense Rabbit is a curiously conservative rebel whose modus vivendi would warm the heart of Bush Republicans -- if they only dared to look and listen. This might leave the rest of us cold were it not for Eminems sheer magnetism. From Jolson through Sinatra to Elvis and beyond the American screen is littered with pop singers who have turned their tonsils to acting but none who can command the lens like this guy. It may be his only role but hes got it nailed -- the slightly hooded stare; the requisite blend of toughness and vulnerability; the body language that holds back and leans away seeming to harbour a secret that the camera burrows in to reveal its eye (and ours) completely riveted. This is James Dean territory a special place off limits to only the privileged handful with the right visa -- that mysterious combination of talent and charisma. A good thing too because minus Eminems compelling presence and the myths broad arc the film is relatively plotless -- not much happens. So director Curtis Hanson (with a major assist from Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto) is wise to ratchet up the atmospherics -- painting a ravaged Detroit at its bleakest. The 8 Mile Road of the title -- the dividing line between suburban and urban rich and poor -- is a blasted landscape of abandoned houses and vacated stores a barren slum where gun shops are the only shops hardy enough to survive. In these depressing environs Rabbit slogs it out on the floor of an automotive plant and tries to give a wide berth to his trailer-trash mother -- a pretty lush Kim Basinger. Basinger (in a surprisingly effective turn) is keenly attentive to her abusive boyfriend and shamelessly neglectful of her youngest child (Rabbits beloved baby sister and the sole totem of his sensitive side). Yes there is a woman in Rabbits life a flashy blonde with ambition (Brittany Murphy) who sparks his libido but surely not his heart. During a lunch break in the far reaches of the factory the two have hungry sex -- heated yet mechanical just like the machine theyre propped up against. Instead his passion and his escape is his music -- the rap whose lyrics he obsessively scrawls in a cramped hand on rumpled paper the rap that he delivers spontaneously to soothe his sister or amuse his friends or diss his foes. Rabbits power (like Eminems) is in the voice that erupts with exquisite intensity from his diminutive body barking rhythmically in the name of song. There his dark reasoning finds its clever internal rhymes. There too Hanson shrewdly switches to a hand-held camera so that the films ragged sights are in perfect synch with the raps jagged sounds. These performance scenes leap out of the frame at you. Elsewhere the tempo slows and the picture is content to meander following Rabbit (the name has an Updikean resonance miles removed from 8 Mile Road) as he hangs out with his home boys his fellow rappers-in-arms. That brings us to the final and crucial difference in this particular twist on the myth. Led by Mekhi Phifer and Omar Benson Miller almost all of Rabbits buddies are black; hes one of the few white faces in his entire circle. This fact is targeted in the rap battles and commented upon by others (""Its always easier for a white man to succeed in a black mans beat""). Yet it doesnt prevent his listeners from respecting his prowess his verbal dexterity. In the dissing contests at the club where the audience is the judge the predominantly black crowds may be rooting for his failure but theyre big enough to applaud his success. Good lord this is a true meritocracy (now theres a notion to scare the establishment). The result is virtually unheard of in American film -- a movie where the communion between black and white feels genuine and isnt made to seem gimmicky or precious or sentimentalized. Here its a natural bond that is rooted in shared anger and suffering and that has its expression in the oral culture of rap a street-wise music where people barely articulate in conversation grow eloquent in song. So what separates Rabbit from the aspiring black rappers is not his colour or even his talent. Its his honesty. He has the ability to see through their dreamy pretensions (""All we ever do here is talk shit. We still livin at home with our mommies"") and the courage to cut to the pragmatic chase. And to cut cleanly. In the final frame Rabbit runs alone -- into the darkness of a colour-blind night.

EW.COM Review The Eminem Show gets personal  EW.com EW.COM All about Eminem QUICKVOTE Are you going to see 8 Mile? Yes No VIEW RESULTS (CNN) -- Love him or hate him -- and there doesnt seem to be much middle ground -- Eminem makes an auspicious debut in the film ""8 Mile."" Whatever ""it"" is Eminem has it. He holds the screen like a vise. You cannot take your eyes off him whenever he appears. Granted the role is very close to his own life and Curtis Hanson (who was nominated for an Oscar for ""L.A. Confidential"") is a brilliant director. But in the end Eminem carries the day -- and the film. Set in 1995 ""8 Mile"" written by Scott Silver is a combination of a coming-of-age story and a succeeding-against-all-odds tale. Think ""Rocky"" (1976) meets ""Purple Rain"" (1984). Its not an autobiographical movie about the rap star but it is very close to the bone. In the middle Eminem plays Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith Jr. a young man caught in a cycle of poverty and demeaning part-time jobs while fighting for his existence along 8 Mile Road in Detroit. The street is the dividing line between the citys suburban and urban population between the black and the white communities. In Detroit music has always been a driving force. From Motown to gospel to hip-hop music has been a way out for the citys blue-collar working poor. Rabbit along with his crew the charismatic Future (Mekhi Phifer) the dreamer Sol (Omar Benson Miller) the aspiring activist DJ Iz (DeAngelo Wilson) and the slow-witted Chedder Bob (Evan Jones) have all turned to hip-hop as their ticket out of the Motor City. In Detroits underworld of hip-hop clubs rappers hold weekly events in which they battle each other with emotionally abusive rhymes. Words are used like weapons that are designed to draw blood and victory goes to the quick-witted. Its here that Rabbit tries to establish himself. RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.com EW.COM  Movie reviews Rabbit grows through his performances in the clubs. In the beginning of the film hes desperate to prove himself but lacks the confidence to seize the day. Hes also torn between his love for his mother (played extremely well by Kim Basinger) and his little sister (an effective performance by young Chloe Greenfield) and the burning desire to escape from their world. While not exactly a musical ""8 Mile"" is most certainly a drama with music (much of it written and performed by Eminem) thats instrumental -- and organic -- to the plot. The film is structured so that the music -- and Rabbits confidence -- builds throughout until the final climatic showdown when Rabbit finally finds his voice. Creating a scene Eminem appears to be a natural as he conveys the emotional turmoil experienced by his character. The love for his music and his yearning to better himself is burning in is eyes. Reportedly Hanson rehearsed with the singer for the unusual period of six weeks -- most movies rehearse for a week or two -- going over and over the script and encouraging him to try each scene in many different ways. Also helpful was the fact that the film was actually shot in Eminems hometown of Detroit and all the main characters were on hand early to just hang out with the singer thereby forming the a closeness that is clear on screen. Brittany (""Ill never tell"") Murphy brings just the right touch of vulnerability and strength to her role of Alex. Alex is also dying to get out of her dead-end life. Her route is modeling not music but she and Rabbit have a common bond in their desire to leave the world of 8 Mile Road behind them forever. Basinger who won an Academy Award for ""L.A. Confidential"" the last time she worked with Hanson shines in her small yet pivotal role as Stephanie Rabbits needy and emotional fragile mother. Shes trapped in her world and sees no way out. Her complete helplessness fuels Rabbits desire. This film and the CD containing music from ""8 Mile"" are enourmous accomplishments for Marshall Mathers III aka Eminem. He may very well find himself with the No. 1 film and the No. 1 CD in the country next week. While its doubtful that Eminem could run out and perform Shakespeare tomorrow his talents on screen -- in this role -- are astounding. Its a far cry from the ""Glitter"" that many stars cover themselves with. ""8 Mile"" opens nationwide on Friday.

The story of a hip-hop-obsessed kid from the trailer parks of Detroits inner suburbs (the title is the name of the road that divides the city proper from the burbs) 8 Mile tracks Eminems characters struggle to break free from a dead-end job and the psychic damage caused by a dead-drunk mom and a deadbeat dad.Things are bad for Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) at the outset of 8 Mile Hes left his girlfriend he doesnt have a car he doesnt have a home. So Jimmy a.k.a. Rabbit a.k.a. Elvis heads back to the trailer where his mom (Kim Basinger in serious white trash mode) lives with his 4-year-old sister (Chloe Greenfield). And where a mess of empty bottles and Moms abusive boyfriend (Michael Shannon) also reside.Jimmys knack for rhyme - he scrawls his verse in tiny letters on crumpled scraps of paper - has gained him some respect in the towns hip-hop circles. (In one song ""Lose Yourself"" he couples sweaty with spaghetti.) But as good as he knows he is - and as good as his friends (Mekhi Phifer Omar Benson Miller and DeAngelo Wilson) tell him he is - Jimmy still chokes when it comes time to do ""battle"" at the Shelter a hall where rappers duke it out in 45-second bursts of pentametric put-downs. Its the audience that decides whos victorious and Jimmy walks away feeling like a loser.Much of the movie is about Jimmys efforts to overcome his rage and his self-doubts and conquer that stage that crowd.In a weird way despite Hansons determinedly unpretty visuals and Eminems effective earnestness and power 8 Mile already feels a little quaint and corny. With the pictures rival gangs reckless road-play and inarticulate romancing (not to mention Basingers Southern-fried histrionics) its not unlike watching the (now-)outdated teen melodrama of Rebel Without a Cause. Maybe thats part of the reason Hanson and screenwriter Scott Silver set the picture in 1995 - if its not going to feel exactly of this moment then set it in some other one.Theres a love story (kind of) in 8 Mile with a tramped-out Brittany Murphy playing Jimmys muse - and Jimmys squeeze in a long and randy stand-up sex scene set in a dark corner of the factory where he works. But the real drama - and poetry - in 8 Mile are in those fiery face-offs the hip-hop battles as Jimmy rat-tat-tats his rap in deft flashes of spontaneous combustion.8 Mile should satisfy Eminems legion of fans (the soundtrack debuts at No. 1 on the album charts this Sunday) and at the same time affirms raps power as an artform as real beat poetry for the uninitiated - and even for the actively resistant.Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.8 Mile  (Out of four stars)Produced by Brian Grazer Curtis Hanson and Jimmy Iovine directed by Hanson written by Scott Silver photography by Rodrigo Prieto music by Eminem and various artists distributed by Universal Pictures.Running time 1 hour 50 mins.Jimmy Smith Jr.. . .

"Yo Hollywood - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EminemMOVIE REVIEW Yo HollywoodIncendiary rapper Eminem makes a surprisingly compelling screen debut under Curtis Hansons direction in 8 Mile.November 08 2002|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer How angry is Eminem the brooding dark prince of perpetually aggrieved sensitivity? Let us count the ways.Angry enough to sell 30 million albums a record for rap. Angry enough to outrage guardians of public decency and allow every disaffected teenager in America to slipstream on his inextinguishable hostility. And angry enough to attract commercially savvy producer Brian Grazer and Curtis Hanson one of the most adept and sophisticated of directors to make ""8 Mile"" a major studio release based loosely on the first steps in the up-from-the-underclass journey Marshall Mathers took to become one of the rulers of rap.But just as ""8 Miles"" story is book-ended by battles one-on-one gladiatorial rap contests in which the audience picks a winner so the film itself is a battle between Gods angry man this creature of insatiable rage and the boa constrictor Hollywood system willing and able to swallow anything whole and make it fit a predigested mold. Even an artist whose justifiable boast is ""I just say whatever I want to whoever I want whenever I want wherever I want however I want"" could disappear without a trace.Remarkably however that did not happen with ""8 Mile"" a fascinating surprisingly entertaining stand-off that has adroitly managed to satisfy both of its constituencies allowing all sides to legitimately claim victory.Yes as written by ""The Mod Squads"" Scott Silver (with according to Entertainment Weekly uncredited work by Jesse Wigutow) ""8 Mile"" is very much an old-fashioned somebody-up-there-likes-me kind of story replete with traditional plot devices (will the hero have to work on the night of the climactic battle?) that are decades old. This venerable structure in effect facilitates the mainstreaming of rap enabling civilian audiences to feel the safety and security of familiarity thats simply not in the cards when listening to Eminems earlier more nasty and threatening work.Yet though you can see ""8 Mile"" and not really know exactly why the man aroused passion pro and con across America you certainly get a strong hint. Eminem has such intense presence that even in the films somewhat denatured form he and his music have undeniable power and integrity. In fact Eminems seething fury impossible to even think of disguising is the realest thing in the film and the heart of its appeal. His hostility savagery and disgust as well as his undeniable musical gifts come from too deep a place to be completely blanded out the way Elvis talents notoriously were and fans who come to ride this particular whirlwind will also not be disappointed.Given the past history of rock-star movies it was far from certain that this particular marriage of sensibilities would work. Two interlocking factors were key in frankly enabling us to forget how formulaic ""8 Mile"" is. One was Eminems genuine presence and on-screen charisma; the other director Hansons filmmaking gifts including an ability (witness Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe in ""L.A. Confidential"" and Michael Douglas in ""Wonder Boys"") to get memorable performances from his lead actors.With deep-set out-from-under eyes and an eight-mile stare Eminem is someone the camera likes from the moment he steps on screen. With his tattoos covered by a hooded sweatshirt and his piercings on hiatus because of the films 1995 setting the actor has something of the quality of an updated James Dean (the director suggested he watch ""East of Eden"" but apparently that never happened) and he carries the picture like its second nature.Eminem plays Jimmy Smith Jr. a.k.a. Bunny Rabbit an aspiring Detroit rapper with a genuine gift for language but an uncertainty about what to do with his life. When ""8 Mile"" begins hes carrying everything he owns in a black plastic trash bag and is about to move back in with his impecunious mother Stephanie (Kim Basinger who won an Oscar in Hansons ""L.A. Confidential"") and her loutish boyfriend Greg (Michael Shannon).Jimmy and his friends dream of rap stardom and in fact two different people insist that they are Bunny Rabbits ticket out. One is his pal Future (Mekhi Phifer of ""Clockers"" and ""O"") who wants Jimmy to persevere in the rap battles he hosts; the other is neighborhood entrepreneur Wink (Eugene Byrd) who insists ""Im building my empire and Im taking you with me.""With a guy as good-looking as Jimmy a romantic entanglement is also inevitable. He runs into the attractive Alex (the talented Brittany Murphy) an aspiring model at the car-bumper factor where he works. At the same factory Jimmy has ""8 Miles"" most curious scene a rap battle where he comes to the defense of a maligned gay fellow worker a sequence that feels like it has more to do with the stars well-publicized difficulties with the gay community than furthering the films plot.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMTV Movie Awards Was Aubrey Plazas stunt with Ferrell planned?April 15 2013High praise from John for EminemApril 8 2005Rapper is shot on 8 Mile RoadNovember 16 2002Grammy Duet by Elton John Eminem Puts Spin on UproarFebruary 10 2001Eminems Latest Seems Sure to Delight Fans Anger ParentsMay 20 2000MORE STORIES ABOUTEminemCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2002/nov/08/entertainment/et-turan8,200,8mile29,8mile,latimes

"Eminem rocks - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Eminem rocksFoul-mouthed rapper plays--surprise--a budding hip-hop star and the white-kid-can-rap story mirrors his own.8 MILE (star)(star)(star)November 08 2002|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic.The movie ""8 Mile"" poses three questions Can rap star Eminem act? Can he be a movie superstar? Is it a decent picture?""Yes"" to the first and third questions and ""maybe"" to the second--though the deck is stacked in the rappers favor. In ""8 Mile"" Eminem the foul-mouthed white rapper who took the pop music world by storm in 1999 plays aspiring Detroit rhymer/climber Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith. Its as good a movie showcase as any solo rock/pop superstar has had with a classy production and a first-rate director (Curtis Hanson of ""L.A. Confidential"").The Beatles ""A Hard Days Night"" remains out of reach but ""8 Mile"" definitely matches well against semi-bio rocker vehicles from Elvis Presleys ""Loving You"" to Princes ""Purple Rain.""Set in Detroits 8 Mile the dividing line between the city limits and the northern suburbs ""8 Mile"" is an exciting well-crafted movie loaded with urban atmosphere. The central role is tailor-made for Eminem (a.k.a. Marshall Mathers) a troubled kid in a multiracial neighborhood trying to find fame in the cutthroat rap world. Eminems gifts of verbal agility and acid ad-libs shine through in Jimmys rap scenes and he has a simmering moody presence that carries him in the dramatic episodes.The movie is a rap rite-of-passage and it follows Jimmy through failures--he chokes on the stage of The Shelter the local rap arena--and through scenes where he hangs with his buddies dreams of stardom copes with a troubled home-life (with mother Stephanie played by Kim Basinger) gets burned by dirty girl Alex (Brittany Murphy) and finally brings it all home.Eminem who looks a bit like gritty British actor Tim Roth holds the screen with a pop stars camera presence and instincts--though I wouldnt say on the evidence here that hes a natural movie actor the way Elvis was or the way Cher Ice Cube and David Bowie are or were earlier pop music stars Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby.Here though he doesnt need to be; ""8 Mile"" is an unabashed ""Rocky""/""Star is Born"" story. Hanson keeps the picture firmly on track and moving smoothly toward the end we all know is coming Jimmys stage battle with mic-to-mic combat under the watchful emcee guidance of Jimmys buddy Future (Mekhi Phifer).But thats a problem. We do know whats coming in almost every scene. From Jimmys tiffs with his beauteous trailer-trash mom and her slimy sponge younger bedmate Greg (Michael Shannon) to his fling with slutty would-be model Alex to his clashes with the local rap champs and his wild night with his guys ""8 Mile"" doesnt give us anything that we couldnt expect.Thats no real drawback if you see the movie as simply a pop musical/star vehicle but it does put a semi-kibosh on its aspirations to urban drama. This is an only lightly disguised male Cinderella story custom-made for Eminem.Whats new and valuable is this well-observed milieu and the way Hanson and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (""Amores Perros"") bring it alive.Hovering over the entire movie is the very promising dramatic idea of a white kid invading black inner-city turf a fictional parallel to the ways Eminem achieved his hip-hop fame with the help of black artist-producers like Dr. Dre--perhaps the partial inspiration for the character Future. Thats a touchy potentially explosive theme which also reminds us of Elvis Presley the white Mississippi kid who melded black rhythm and blues and white rockabilly into a potent crossover brew.Potentially its a story about cultural assimilation but the script turns it more into a male-bonding movie. Skewing the whole movie toward cliche is the way Jimmys relationship with Future is sentimentalized. (With his hipster dreadlocks and paternalistic warmth Phifer almost steals the movie.) It may have been a mistake though for buddy Future to also function as the Shelters emcee which makes the battles look semi-rigged. It might have been better to split the character up and make The Shelters emcee a different guy one more hostile another hurdle for Jimmy to clear.Similarly the relationship stuff with Jimmys mother seems to exist mostly to exploit audience knowledge of Eminems own mother-bashing lyrics and lawsuits. And the choice to hire writer Silver--whose first movie was ""johns"" a sympathetic portrayal of an urban gay scene--seems designed to answer widespread complaints of homophobia in Eminems lyrics as does the scene where Jimmy trashes a gay-slamming rapper.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesIce Cube vs. Ashton KutcherFebruary 28 2005Role reversal for white rappersNovember 19 2002Eminem remixes life storyOctober 28 2002Ice Cubes road trip to movie stardomJanuary 21 2005Find More Stories AboutRapEminemTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-11-08/entertainment/0211080413_1_eminem-rap-jimmy-rabbit-smith,200,8mile31,8mile,chicagotribune

The rough power as well as the humor and sensitivity of pop phenom Eminem is delivered intact in ""8 Mile."" By taking a gritty unvarnished and emotionally truthful look at the grim pre-fame background of the breakthrough white rapper pic looks to turn the trick of pleasing his young fans as well as winning over many previously skeptical viewers more drawn to director Curtis Hansons work than to rap. A dynamite soundtrack wont hurt B.O. appeal of this first-rate music-driven drama which has the potential to bust out of its perceived niche to connect with many different segments of the public. Slim Shady/Marshall Mathers/Eminem takes on yet another persona as Jimmy Smith Jr. aka Rabbit whos the only white dude deemed worthy of joining the talented brothers in the raging rap battles staged at the Shelter. Opening scene plunges right into the heart of this molten milieu as Jimmy after puking from anxiety completely chokes upon being handed the mike and stalks off to the clamorous derision of club denizens. Having just split up with his girlfriend Jimmy has no choice but to crash with his mom who is the very definition of trailer trash. Sexy but battered and worn the jobless Stephanie (Kim Basinger) lives in the 8 Mile mobile court with her young daughter Lily (Chloe Greenfield) and is hanging on to a relationship with a condescending ass Greg (Michael Shannon) in the belief that the large insurance settlement hes due to receive will change her life. Set over the course of a week Scott Silvers vibrant script credibly evokes urban lower-income working class American life in a way that major studio films havent much cared to do for the last quarter-century. Without any grandstanding or dawdling Hansons direction reinforces the intense identification of the story with its specific setting Detroit 1995 by doing what he did for Los Angeles in ""L.A. Confidential"" and Pittsburgh in ""Wonder Boys""-finding dramatic backgrounds with a lived-in quality that inform and strengthen the meaning of the action played out against them. In this case they are mostly locations inside the citys eponymous perimeter road that divides Detroits white suburbs and black inner city. Festering with blight and pock-marked by shuttered businesses and formerly grand homes and buildings either gutted or grotesquely transformed for other uses the place seems utterly hopeless -- one where the only chance would seem to lie in getting away. But for all the characters here that dream is a ways off if it exists at all. His club flame-out notwithstanding Jimmy has a supportive crew that considers him something close to a genius the encouraging religiously inclined Future (Mekhi Phifer); gentle giant Sol (Omar Benson Miller); bespectacled comically self-serious DJ Iz (DeAngelo Wilson) and tag-along dufus Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones) the only other white guy in the group. Also looking to latch onto Jimmys gravy-train is aspiring promoter Wink (Eugene Byrd) who keeps dangling the possibility of free studio time in front of Jimmy. Hanson who early in his career directed a film called ""Losin It"" about a bunch of guys (including a pre-""Risky Business"" Tom Cruise) tooling around Tijuana looking for kicks here demonstrates not only how hes grown as a filmmaker but that its possible to depict a group of kids messing around on a Saturday night without capitulating to teen-pic cliches. With Jimmy at the wheel of moms amusingly unreliable old heap the boys get high fire off paint-rifle blasts get into an altercation with a thuggish rival crew after an impromptu parking lot rap session hang at a club (the actual Chin Tiki brought back to life) where Jimmy befriends flirty scenester and aspiring model Alex (Brittany Murphy) and set fire to an abandoned house where a little girl was raped. Entire nocturnal interlude brims with the spirit of youthful fun and hijinks but realistically so without a trace of banality stupidity or pandering. Naturalistic fabric is effectively extended to the combustible events of the following week. Trying to out-macho the other guys by pulling a gun during a street fight the hapless Cheddar Bob shoots himself in the groin; Alex swings by the metal stamping factory where Jimmy works one lunch hour and the two get it on in a surprisingly erotic scene enacted silently amid the background noise of clanking machinery; Jimmy and Greg come to blows after Stephanie is given an eviction notice at the trailer camp and Jimmy has fallings-out -- one emotionally bottled up the other brutally physical -- with both Future and Wink. It all comes together where it began on another Friday night at the Shelter in an electrifying 15-minute rap battle sequence. Before a frenzied and challenging audience Jimmy and a series of three opponents exchange ever-escalating timed and rhymed verbal abuse insults and take-downs with the last man standing proclaimed the champ. Detractors could presumably carp that this rousing finale is just a rap variation on the ending of ""Rocky"" with the Great White Hope (or ""Elvis"" as Jimmy is sometimes jokingly called) beating the blacks at their own game. But whereas Stallones character was purest fiction -- when after all was the last white American heavyweight champ? -- ""8 Mile"" has the authenticity and integrity of Eminem in its corner the credible evidence that ""Jimmy"" does exactly what the actor/performer has and is capable of doing himself. Even while running with his boys Jimmy sets himself apart from them in crucial ways; part of the success of Eminems performance is that he conveys the sense of a mind at work amid drudgery and intermittent lunacy. When his friends go at one another for the umpteenth time about what a loser so-and-so might be Jimmy brings them down to earth by pointing out that theyre all broke and living with their mothers. Jimmy is seen working out his rhymes on scrap paper at odd moments and some of the films best scenes show rap is a living art rooted in the street -- as in a juicy episode during which some factory workers including Jimmy get into it verbally during a break around the lunch truck. Latter scene features Jimmy jumping to the defense of a ridiculed gay worker which would seem to rep a minor piece of calculation designed to counter the stars perceived homophobia. But its the only moment that feels remotely contrived as pic is dedicated to a tough-minded view of the necessity of finding your own voice going your own way when necessary and making the most of your talent. Brooding emotionally explosive sensitive and caring with his little sister -- and clearly simmering with ideas and feelings -- Eminem is magnetic playing a version of himself. Hanson reportedly showed him some James Dean films in preparation and for once the influence has been positive rather than indulgent. Along with a commanding star turn at the films center ""8 Mile"" boasts a sterling ensemble in the manner of Hansons last two films. Basinger is entirely credible as the single mom who is as irresponsible as her son is purposeful while Murphy cuts an insinuating swath as a saucy little slut with her eye on the prize. Phifer is most ingratiating as Jimmys biggest and most sincere booster while the other actors playing Jimmys entourage contribute distinctive flavorings. Shot in plain unadorned fashion by Rodrigo Prieto (""Amores Perros"") pic thoroughly inhabits its bleak milieu. As for scenarist Silver surely few screenwriters have ever bounced back from something as awful as ""The Mod Squad"" to something as good as ""8 Mile."" Bulging soundtrack is dominated by 90s hip hop but includes two new Eminem numbers the title tune and the powerful anthem ""Lose Yourself"" played in full behind the end credits. 8 MileProductionA Universal release of a Universal Pictures and Imagine Entertainment presentation of a Brian Grazer/Curtis Hanson production.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Sorry hordes. In 8 Mile his film debut as aspiring rapper Jimmy Smith Jr. Eminem is on fire. Its too soon to tell if he can really act. But Eminem holds the camera by natural right. His screen presence is electric. His sulk -- hooded eyes that suddenly spark with danger -- has an intensity to rival James Deans. And he reads lines with an offbeat freshness that makes his talk and his rap sound interchangeable. Just as it should be. Jimmy known as Rabbit competes in freestyle verbal battles against black rappers at a local club. Like Eminem who did the same Rabbit is pissed off plenty at his mom (Kim Basinger) for slutting around; at his ex-girl (Taryn Manning) for pretending shes pregnant; at himself for choking in front of an audience. In his first scene in his first movie Eminem pukes his guts out. 8 Mile sharply directed by Curtis Hanson from a script by Scott Silver (whos a long way from the inanities of The Mod Squad) is a real movie not a fast-buck package to exploit the fan base of a rap nonentity (hello Vanilla Ice goodbye). Hanson succeeds brilliantly at creating a world around Eminem that teems with hip-hop energy and truth.inematographer Rodrigo Prieto (Amores Perros) lights Detroit like a scarred battlefield. Set in 1995 the film uses 8 Mile -- the stretch of road that serves as Detroits social and racial dividing line -- as a hurdle for Rabbit. Stuck in a trailer park with his broke single mom and his adored kid sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield) Rabbit takes a job at an auto plant so he can stop living in his dreams.pgt;ut the dream persists. His friend Future (an avid Mekhi Phifer) who hosts the hip-hop battles sees Rabbits potential. So does Alex (Brittany Murphy) the wanna-be model who itches to get close to Rabbit. Their quickie unprotected sex at the auto plant (she takes his hat off otherwise they stay dressed) defines steamy. Murphy plays Alex with hot desperation and calloused vulnerability. Shes dynamite. Hanson (L.A. Confidential Wonder Boys) excels with actors. Basinger shines as the neglectful mom who bitches to Rabbit about her boyfriend (""He wont go down on me"") and pegs her son as a born loser. Rabbits support system is his crew Sol (Omar Benson Miller) DJ Iz (DeAngelo Wilson) and Cheddar Bob (a scene-stealing Evan Jones).anson builds to a spectacular climax with Rabbit going three rounds at the club ultimately taking on the reigning champ Popa Doc (Anthony Mackie) in a rap showdown. Its Rocky and Apollo Creed but this time the words fly like fists. Eminem wears the role like a second skin but hes not totally cleaning out his closet. The Rocky stuff softens the films edges (and boosts its box-office chances). Rabbit who decries guns plays dad to Lily and offers a handshake to a gay co-worker isnt quite the bile-spewing convicted felon who wrote ""You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine."" No matter. 8 Mile qualifies as a cinematic event by tapping into the roots of Eminem and the fury and feeling that inform his rap. Hanson spares us the rags-to-riches cliches by leaving Rabbit on the edge of success. The film ends not with a blast but with the peace that comes to a rapper who finds his voice at last. That kind of class is a big risk for a novice stepping into the movie ring. Eminem wins by a knockout. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

"Eminems Debut A Hip-Hop Rocky | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Eminems Debut A Hip-Hop Rocky By Rex Reed  11/04/02 1200am The acting debut of repugnant rap star Eminem in a thing called 8 Mile can be summed up in one sentence If he coulda he woulda but he caint so he aint. This brainless debacle tailored for the insurmountable limitations of its star attraction was headed for vehicular homicide before it left the factory. Who knew the impact of the crash would be louder than the noise on the soundtrack CD? Marshall Mathers a.k.a. Eminem cant act. No surprise there. But the baffling mystery is why Curtis Hanson a writer-director of skill style and power is pissing away his talent to prove it. Movies are made for many reasons and greed is one of them. Hopping spread-eagle on the hip-hop bandwagon is an inevitability for somebody but transforming the hateful nihilistic rap war against society symbolized by Eminem is a big waste of time for Mr. Hanson the polished director of such elegant triumphs as L.A. Confidential and Wonder Boys . Must be the money. O.K. so Im the wrong audience for this teenage junk. To me rap is crap. Big news. And two hours of torture about the empty posturing of a no-talent loser who dreams of becoming the next Tupac Shakur does not fit my definition of upward mobility. But Im as curious as the next chump to see what kind of tour de force a great director might make out of the rise to fame of a scowling goon whose seductive powers have incited a generation of lost kids to decree that conventional civilized society is doomed to perish. In the case of 8 Mile  curiosity has killed this cat for the last time. Im staying home with Cole Porter and the Gershwins. Eminem plays Jimmy (Rabbit) Smith a trailer-park punk who works in a machine shop to save enough money to make a demo record and lives in a cartoon frame from Gasoline Alley with his whorish unemployed alcoholic white-trash mother (Kim Basinger hopelessly sweating to bring the only semblance of craft to the chaos). Shrieked at by her beaten by her abusive freeloading boyfriend and misunderstood by his prejudiced boss Rabbit lives a grim dead-end life but beneath his pierced nipples beats the heart of a multi-platinum Grammy winner. At first glance it seems like a shameless biopic about Eminem himself but look closer and youll detect a warmed-over recycled Rocky in a high-speed microwave. Both are set in blighted industrial wastelands. This time its Detroit (""8 Mile"" is the slum that separates the city from the suburbs) instead of Philadelphia. Both tell of the inspirational struggles of deprived hardscrabble white guys trying to break into vocations typically dominated by African-Americans. Mekhi Phifer plays Rabbits mentor a hood named Future-the Burgess Meredith character with dreadlocks instead of a wool hat. Future hosts a series of ""battles"" verbal sparring matches in which rappers go head-to-head to win the approval of the audience which are sort of gritty profanity-laden versions of American Idol . When hes not slaving at the factory saving his dysfunctional mother or waxing philosophic on the futile plight of the working class Rabbit has to face his black challengers and their fans who boo and jeer him off the stage. Unfortunately for us all he refuses to stay down for the count and the film plunges into an endless hip-hop tirade of arrogance rage and attitude about a white boy trying to hack his way into the closed-shop jive-ass whacked-out all-black jungle of sewer poets. The stunt casting of Eminem guarantees a high profile (and hopeful box-office results) for a film that otherwise would never have made it beyond the midnight-madness section on the festival circuit. But hes also a distraction to the story unfolding around him and the whole thing feels like a promotional video for Eminems next single. Instead of exploring the emotional subtext of his rhythmic scatology his near-catatonic face is a mask of simmering fury. When he talks he mumbles. When he walks he shuffles. His one sex scene behind the factory lunch-truck with foxy Brittany Murphy is crude and phony. With his skull caps and dorky backward baseball caps he doesnt act the material; he stares his way through it. Its payback time for Kim Basinger (who won an Oscar under Mr. Hansons direction in L.A. Confidential ) but the role of Eminems dilapidated mother is such a one-note dirge that I doubt if she could find her characters motivation if someone tattooed it on her forehead. Is she emotionally complex or just crazy? Are we meant to empathize or just laugh? Brittany Murphy as the obligatory squeeze is equally ill-defined. Is she Eminems muse a dangerous distraction or just a cheap groupie who sleeps around? By the end of the movie Eminem seems to have lost interest and so did I. Mr. Hanson captures the dismal desperation of Detroit and its denizens quite well but a predictable story with two-dimensional cliches and menacing sarcasm passing for dialogue is a poor substitute for valid filmmaking. Eminem fans may line up on opening day but if youre not a follower of this anarchy-or if youve already seen all the Rocky flicks-theres no reason for you to bother. Wait for 8 Mile IV  where Eminem will probably take on the rapping champion of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile I suppose the purpose of 8 Mile is to bring an ugly brand of non-music into the arena of mainstream entertainment and exploit one of its creepiest (and most popular) teenage idols as a marketing tool for fun and profit. The thought of Eminem as a movie star is horrible enough but even if a lack of better judgment sentences you to two hours of this punishment the sight of Eminem vomiting is not my idea of a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card. A Shallow Remake Another fine director bites the dust with Jonathan Demmes messy incoherent The Truth About Charlie  an unnecessary and catastrophic remake of Stanley Donens classic Charade . The original starred sophisticated Cary Grant and rapturous Audrey Hepburn as two strangers caught up in a romantic caper in Paris. Released in 1963 at the height of the French New Wave it was the perfect antidote to the pretentious tedium that was pouring out of Europe at the time-mostly forgotten now by all but a few critics and Mr. Demme. Sitting around with too little to do and a career on a downward spiral since The Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia  Mr. Demme appears to be inspired by the notion that if Charade had been made in the gritty free-form style of a Jean-Luc Godard it would have been a very different kind of film indeed. If youve ever wondered how bad ideas are born take this as a textbook example. ""Marky"" Mark Wahlberg as Cary Grant? I dont think so. The best low-budget New Wave films championed unconventional casting but this is ridiculous. An expensive Hollywood attempt to recreate salty realism only comes off as deliberately amateurish. (Imagine Jules and Jim by Jerry Bruckheimer in full color and Dolby Digital surround sound with Madonna and helicopters. You get the picture.) Among this films damaging influences Mr. Demme also lists the breakneck hysteria of Tom Tykwers Run Lola Run and the pretentious anesthesia of Lars von Triers nutty Dogme 95 musical Dancer in the Dark . With such a gumbo of styles its no wonder this movie makes no sense. What begins as a free-wheeling hommage ends up more like a made-for-cable thriller directed by an overzealous film-school freshman; the whole thing plays out like a campy episode of the old Batman TV series. Amazingly Stanley Donen gave his blessing to this travesty. I wonder how much he regrets it now. Worse still the movies trailer betrays none of the directors high-concept intentions leading you to believe youre in for a straight-up conventional thriller. When the nauseating cinematography and disjointed narrative start rolling youll find yourself staring quizzically at the screen wondering if the Three Stooges are running rampant through the cinema. The premise varies little at the outset. Audrey Hepburns Regina now played by Thandie Newton returns from a vacation to find her assets liquidated her husband murdered and herself the prime suspect. Cary Grants is-he-or-isnt-he Peter Joshua (Wahlberg alas) is the handsome stranger who knows the corpse stole a lot of money that the crooks and the cops think shes hiding. Even sparing them cruel comparisons the two stars still disappoint. Like Matt Damon in The Bourne Identity  this young American everyguy is utterly out of place in the world of sophisticated international espionage where the killers all drive Maseratis and know how to order foie gras in eight languages. With the entire storyline hinging on his cunning deceptions and charming duplicity Mr. Wahlberg has neither the subtlety nor the range to pull it off. Far from the image of a transatlantic man of mystery in Armani suits he wanders the streets of Montmartre looking like a confused dockworker in a beret. Audrey Hepburn wouldnt trust him to bag her groceries let alone save her life. Thandie Newton is no Audrey Hepburn either but here as in the awful Mission Impossible II  she gets dropped into so much confusion without a parachute that as an actress she never really stands a chance of landing on her feet. Tim Robbins plays a secret government agent who is about as threatening as my accountant. Except for Ted Levine ( the deranged Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs ) the rest of the rats and spies resemble rejects from the James Bond casting department. For all of its unconventional aspirations the movies fundamental basics-plot character dialogue-couldnt be more mundane. Woefully lacking in suspense it plods along to its obvious climax while Mr. Demmes irritating hand-held camera careens around making everyone in the audience carsick. The one interesting idea here is the attempt to capture a realistic view of 21st-century Paris and its multi-ethnic character as opposed to the idealized buttercream-icing landscapes of other Audrey Hepburn films like Funny Face and Paris When It Sizzles . I liked the old Paris better. When I see Montparnasse I dont want it to look like West End Avenue. Most disappointing of all New Wave icons Charles Aznavour and Anna Karina both make cameo appearances which is kind of like Katharine Hepburn showing up in a movie to salute the Olsen twins. With The Truth About Charlie  Jonathan Demme has done for soigne suspense thrillers what Baz Luhrmanns Moulin Rouge did for musicals-incinerated a cherished genre in an effulgence of shallow artsy ideas. Its a forgery that diminishes not only the originality and pleasure of the film it copies but also the entire school of filmmaking it wants to emulate. Mr. Demme needs to get back to making movies from his own fertile ideas instead of ruining the established ideas of others. Farewell Adolph New York lost one of its most colorful creative and beloved good-will ambassadors with the passing of Adolph Green last week at 87. The timeless take-home tunes and prolific books and lyrics that Green and his writing partner Betty Comden penned for legendary MGM musicals ( Singin in the Rain  Good News  The Band Wagon ) and Broadway shows ( Bells Are Ringing  On the Town  Wonderful Town  Peter Pan  Billion Dollar Baby and The Will Rogers Follies  to name a few) symbolized the highest quality of achievement in witty urbane and sophisticated film and theater music for more than half a century. As a trumpet-blower for the Apple Green was as much an icon and a landmark in this town as the Statue of Liberty. And he was everywhere. Even after his eyesight failed his multi-talented wife Phyllis Newman used to lead him around at every social event Broadway opening concert and cocktail party that was worth attending. With his famous mop of white hair and a wall-to-wall grin that reminded me of an eternal Jewish leprechaun he would grab my hand and say ""So nice to feel you again."" Goodbye Adolph and thanks for making New York New York one helluva town.

Set in 1995 in some of the most bombed-out sections of Detroit Curtis Hansons gritty and electrifying fable is built around bits and pieces of Eminems life and mythology yet it has an unruly immediacy all its own. Eminem plays Jimmy ""Rabbit"" Smith a factory worker who crashes with his deadbeat mom (Kim Basinger) in a trailer park and competes in improvised rap duels. By the end our desire to see him let out his rage is palpable and the big rap contest is one of the most purely exciting scenes the movies have given us in years.
