"A Spear Without Sharpness washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On A Spear Without Sharpness Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints Friday January 20 2006 ""End of the Spear"" directed and co-written by Jim Hanon is based on a true event in 1956 when five American missionaries were speared to death by the very Ecuadorean tribesmen they had hoped to convert. Anyone who wants to see this story in unequivocally glowing terms -- five honorable men martyred for spreading the Gospel -- should be satisfied. The film takes pains to reprise the events that led to the tragedy and the moral victory that followed in which the wives and children of those slain -- James Elliot Peter Fleming Edward McCully Roger Youderian and Nate Saint -- prevailed upon the natives to stop their deadly infighting which threatened the very survival of the Waodani people. But those seeking a more secular perspective will be disappointed. Although the film invests time among the tribesmen it never really explores the idea that one mans missionary work is anothers ideological aggression. And the movie is tentative dramatically speaking. The violence happens off-frame and the Waodani tribesmen cast spears with all the intimidation of pee wee league pitchers. The music is relentlessly syrupy and never did a rainforest look more like a backlit soundstage. The most powerful moments come at the end -- documentary excerpts of Steve Saint the son of one of the missionaries and his friendship with Mincayani the man who killed his father. -- Desson Thomson End of the Spear PG-13 108 minutes Contains violence. In Waodani Spanish and English with subtitles. Area theaters.

Louie Leonardo as Mincayani in End of the Spear. Photo Every Tribe Entertainment Point all too obvious in bluntly didactic jungle adventure 1 / 1 Back to Gallery End of the Spear Drama. Starring Chad Allen. Directed by Jim Hanon. (PG-13. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A Christian message is contained within ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe."" But those who choose not to be receptive to it will still be thoroughly entertained by an exceptionally well-crafted movie that doesnt push the allegory. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of ""End of the Spear"" a Christian-themed film about redemption with almost no redeeming qualities as entertainment. Theres plenty of inherent drama in this true story of missionaries brutally speared to death in Ecuador 50 years ago by a jungle tribe they were seeking to help. But the movie just plods along failing to bring to life either the missionary families or the Waodani tribespeople. In order to be moved by its far-reaching impact you have to keep reminding yourself that this tragedy brought on by a terrible misunderstanding and miscommunication really happened. The missionaries led by Nate Saint (TV actor Chad Allen) came to the Amazon to prevent the Waodanis from killing one another. Their warlike ways had brought the tribe close to extinction. Every few days Nate leaves his family and sets off in a bright yellow airplane to try to spot the elusive Waodanis bringing along for luck a model of the plane he made with his young son Steve. Decades later when Steve returns to the area to learn more about his dads death he finds the model. Its an indication of director Jim Hanons total lack of subtlety that he finds it necessary to throw in a flashback of father and son working on the plane so the audience is sure to get the significance. Allen who also plays Steve as an adult brings a forced cheeriness to both roles. Allens Nate might be setting off on a pleasure trip instead of a dangerous mission each time he flies off. By contrast the natives are portrayed as ominously nasty from the get-go. Their nostrils practically flare. Theyre presented as broad caricatures like the Indians in early Westerns. The message of redemption becomes clear at the end of ""Spear"" when Steve shows the power of his faith. Too bad this sincere but inept movie doesnt do justice to any of the real people whose powerful story it tells. -- Advisory This film contains scenes of violence.

"Spear doesnt pierce quite deeply enough - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Spear doesnt pierce quite deeply enough By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 20 2006 If you just read Ty Burrs review of Terrence Malicks The New World"" and are thinking Id to like to see a chattier and somehow more grandiose tale of indigenous peoples and their fragile bond with white outsiders"" End of the Spear"" is what you want. Its not remotely as luscious or half as bold as Malicks movie but it is shorter and more educational.Set in the Ecuadoran jungle in the Amazon basin End of the Spear"" re-creates the true story of five nondenominational Christian missionaries who in 1956 were killed by members of the Aucas tribe. Most of the film is told from the point of view of Steve Saint the young son of Nathaniel Saint one of the slain men who narrates as an adult. Chad Allen plays both grown-up Steve and his dad. The rest of the film is devoted to the Aucas who after the slaughter changed their name to the Waodani which is how theyre referred to throughout End of the Spear.""The tribe is a squabbling bunch whose members seem to have no problem fatally impaling one other with spears. This has won them a savage reputation and has also brought them to the brink of extinction. But Nathaniel and his fellow missionaries descend upon the tribe in the hopes of saving it. (The movie was shot in Panama and used the countrys Embera Indians and their language to get the film made.)One Waodani Gimade (Ninabet Bedoya) is miserable that her sister Dayumae (Christina Souza) has left the tribe. Unbeknownst to her Dayumae happens to be living happily among the missionaries whove just landed near the Waodani village. But after one testy tribesman fibs to his chief Mincayani (Louie Leonardo) that the missionaries ate Dayumae hell breaks loose and the white men are killed in an unsparing sequence.Not long after the massacre however Dayumae leads Nathaniels good-hearted widow little Steve and the sister of another slain missionary to the Waodani village where everyone makes amends and lives more or less harmoniously for years. Improbable but -- attesting to the apparent boundlessness of Christian tolerance -- true. End of the Spear"" means to impart messages of forgiveness and forbearance and obviously we are meant to be moved.But End of the Spear"" is an adventure movie before it is anything else. Last year the director Jim Hanon put out a documentary Beyond the Gates of Splendor"" that covered the same material. For round two he seems thrilled to have cranes Steadicams and helicopter shots at his disposal. The percussive score pulses and soars like music from a generic jungle flick (it falls into a musical category that Variety recently called orchestral with ethnic elements"").The characters however are not as exhilarating or well conceived as any of the action sequences are well choreographed. This is too bad because the true story is such a fascinating convergence of earnestness and incivility. Hector Babencos longer loopier 1991 adaptation of At Play in the Fields of the Lord"" deals with similar travails of Indians and white missionaries in South America but it actually gets its hands dirty sorting out the religious and moral conflicts. End of the Spear"" is tidier more didactic and less exceptional. Not an emotional powerhouse so much as a dutiful public service announcement. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Film should find great favor principally among religious auds and a long life on the home-vid shelves. As 2004s ""The Passion of the Christ"" drove home so emphatically a great unserved appetite exists for Christian-themed films so its no surprise that movies such as director/co-writer Jim Hanons ""End of the Spear"" are moving in to fill the void. Pic is based on the real-life 1956 incident in which five American missionaries were killed by a remote Amazonian tribe. The story was reported on at the time by Life magazine photojournalist Cornell Capa. Although overly earnest and often stilted the film should find great favor principally among religious auds and a long life on the home-vid shelves. ""End of the Spear"" approaches its story primarily as a family drama. Nate Saint (Chad Allen) is the beloved husband of Marj Saint (Cara Stoner) and father of their young son Steve (Chase Ellison). A skilled pilot Nate is also devoted to what he sees as his spiritual duty Finding -- and eventually converting -- an isolated Ecuadorian tribe called the Waodani whose internecine warfare threatens to exterminate them. Although exactly how Nate and his 4-member team plan to save the Waodani is not clearly articulated it involves their spreading the word of God to the natives. But they are killed almost immediately by the Waodani whom the filmmakers portray -- not as the noble savages one might expect -- but as ignorant fearful and especially superstitious. The allegorical impulse of the film is to position the missionaries as angelic and the tribe members who have yet to hear Gods word as mere savages with Mincayani (Louie Leonardo) the most fierce and resistant of the Waodani. Lenser Robert Driskell has some spectacular territory to work with (principal photography took place in Panama rather than the dramatic setting of Ecuadors Amazon basin). But Driskells work like many of the films technical aspects also involved logistical hurdles all overcome with aplomb. Aerial work for a scene when Nate takes tribesmen up in a small plane is particularly impressive. ""End of the Spear"" with its double-edged title is a decidedly talky movie one that gets going only after news of the missionaries deaths reaches their families and wives and children move in with the inhospitable tribes people. Narrated by the adult Steve Saint (Allen again) it tells us almost everything we see happening -- but without a lot of resulting illumination. Likewise the music by Ronald Owen is unnecessarily and inappropriately triumphant even strident where it should perhaps be more melancholic; not every move made by the ""good"" characters requires a heroic fanfare. ""End of the Spear"" contains a large amount of violence although it is a long way from the relentless brutality of ""The Passion of the Christ"" and violence didnt hurt that movie. Pic is as one might expect a far more understated work although its primary point is evangelical all the same. End of the SpearProductionAn M.

(The 1933 King Kong participated in this racist cosmology and theres no denying thats an element of its primal power.) End of the Spear is more superficially enlightened Its an ooga-booga movie dressed in ""anthropological"" empathy. As we follow five American missionaries who look about as ready for adventure as the Kingston Trio into the Amazon jungles of Ecuador in 1953 we also see life from the point of view of the Waodani a violent tribe whose homicide rate has brought them to the verge of extinction. End of the Spear never quite shakes free of presenting the Waodani as the mysterious other -- barbarians waiting to be civilized. The missionaries dont hang around long enough to do it but the movie which is atrociously scripted and edited carries out the mission for them turning Mincayani (Louie Leonardo) a surly and handsome Waodani leader from killer to saint without making psychological sense of either.
