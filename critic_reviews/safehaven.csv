Report Chandler Parsons  Next The Not Quite Midseason Awards Courtesy of Warner Bros Facebook Twitter Print Die Hard Die Die Die Die Die Yeah so the new John McClane joint aint so hot. Plus The rest of the week in movies. by Wesley Morris on February 15 2013 Should an action movie care? Should it care to do more than send a state-of-the-art helicopter sinking out of the sky because theres an armored truck dangling chained from its cargo bay? Should it care that as inventive a stunt as that weighed-down chopper might be it is alas only a stunt in a film littered with similar stunts? Should it care that an audience might need more than cars that fly off one level of a Russian highway only to cause mayhem when they land on the road below that we might need actual screenwriting to give some sense and structure to all that chaos? A Good Day to Die Hard is an action movie and it definitely doesnt care. This is the fifth and least of the Die Hard movies. Its most loving imagery all involves people and vehicles falling to the ground. One of those falling people finds the mental clarity to thrust up his middle finger on his way down. Thats supposed to be a rousing moment of triumph but its just a depressing show of contempt -- for the audience for the genre and the series. The movie never earns the right to be so cavalier. The bird-flipper is Bruce Williss John McClane the NYPD detective who became an iconic movie hero in the first three Die Hard movies outsmarting and outliving terrorists and a cartoon by the fourth. Its not simply his indestructibility that now makes him less than real (his die-hardness has never been up for debate). But for at least the first three movies the excitement came from both McClanes vulnerability and epic lucklessness (he was once allegedly just a cop). Bad news and worse people -- Europeans all -- refused to stop intruding on his already dysfunctional life. In these last two terribly titled movies (2007s Live Free or Die Hard stunk up screens a dozen years after the urban fun and racial daring of Die Hard With a Vengeance which actually began life as a Brandon Lee thriller called Simon Says) McClane has gone completely bald and turned into a kind of disaster junkie. Hes as turned on by mass destruction as the nutjobs we expect him to vanquish. Originally Willis was something new for the action movie which had been defined by old-guard right-wingers and muscly monosyllabic ethnics. He was this little blue-collar smart-ass with a receding hairline. What he lacked in physicality he made up for in attitude. When the first Die Hard arrived in the late summer of 1988 Willis was known as the guy bantering with Cybill Shepherd on ABCs Moonlighting. His charm came from his seeming both mildly drunk and slightly hungover. He was louche and sleazy and cocky but not secure enough to believe that he was more charismatic than she was. That of course made him kind of sexy He wanted her approval and by extension ours. Putting Willis at the scene of a hostage situation where one of the hostages was McClanes wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) with the scene being a Los Angeles skyscraper gave his macho street intelligence potentially a real challenge Could he take out an entire gang of Germanic evil? The excitement of Willis in these first three movies was how he kept surprising himself. He seemed to have no idea what he was doing until he was doing it. But the directors -- John McTiernan for the first and third; Renny Harlin for the outrageous second -- understood how to take a formula thriller and proceed as though the world had never seen a heist movie. They had clever-enough scripts that bumped up the scale -- terrorists in our buildings our airports our subways -- without sacrificing our ability to relate to the stakes or navigate the action. Will McClane save Holly? Will he save New York? Its hard to appreciate but Die Hard was such a mold-breaking hit that it made most action movies strive almost parodically for its formula. Speed was Die Hard on a bus. Cliffhanger was Die Hard on a mountain. Virtuosity was Die Hard in cyberspace. Setting aside mild-mannered suspense dramas like 1974s The Taking of Pelham One Two Three Die Hard was the action-movie Big Bang. Whats remarkable about all three movies is their attention to pacing and setup. In the first film theres so much going on in and around the Nakatomi building that creates tension and suspense for McTiernan to exploit. Each establishes precisely the terms of the various conflicts so that once the action gets under way its inextricable from the drama thats driving it. The chases and murders and explosions are part of the narrative. This is also known as storytelling and its virtually extinct in the action movies current iteration. By 2007 the action movie was thinking more globally. The North American box office was no longer enough. These movies werent content with saving Manhattan. They had to save the world mostly by hopping from one time-stamped locale to the next. But to work on that scale a movie needs a prevailing scope a sense not only that the planet is big but an idea of how the heroes fit within all that borderlessness. Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol is a wonderful example of how an internationalist franchise had found a way to work globally yet with some humor and intimacy. A Good Day to Die Hard is set in Moscow but has a plot that changes its mind. A political prisoner plot becomes an international intrigue plot which becomes an epic terrorism plot. With each narrative costume change the location becomes increasingly beside the point. Never mind that most of the later action involves Chernobyl a specific notorious Russian location thats treated with little reverence for the atrocity thats left it such a barren wasteland. How the movie gets here isnt important Basically McClanes estranged adult son Jack (Jai Courtney) is a spy shepherding a Russian oppositionist (Sebastian Koch) first to retrieve an important file and then to his sexy daughter and then to safety. McClane heads to Moscow to see Jack and winds up a gleeful participant in highway demolition derbies and elaborate shootouts. But the movie is determined to force the drama of this story into some kind of father-son reconciliation. John turns goopy with resentment. Jacks eyes begin to well up with the tears of a son who misses the father he spends an hour saying he hates. Of all the illogic on display in this movie (is neutralizing radiation as possible as it is here?) the sentiment curdling between these two is the most galling -- mainly since its the least of the reasons weve come. None of it seems to bother Willis though. He looks happy to be in a movie he can dominate with his smirk. Despite McClanes no longer being a smoker Willis does things with his face that make it appear as though hes taking long satisfying drags on an unseen cigarette. But hes much better than this sort of payday exercise. Did he not see himself in Looper or Moonrise Kingdom? He doesnt have much else to do here beyond shoot and smirk. Covered in blood and broken glass he seems superfluous. The movie is more a showcase for the stunt team and the effects department and their work especially during all the slow-motion absurdity of the finale is often stunning. Its cheap dissatisfying and sad -- a blockbuster with Die Hard flavoring. For what its worth the director is John Moore working from a rickety script by Skip Woods. Moore is competent but he might as well be designing one of the video games thats spun off from this franchise. There are all of the mechanics and rote villainy (one of the Eurobaddies chomps on a carrot and declares his contempt for America) but no higher (or even lower) purpose to speak of. We get all the seriess destruction with none of the plot character actors suspense coherence or tank tops of the first three movies. Its cheap dissatisfying and sad -- a blockbuster with Die Hard flavoring. This fifth installment actually embodies what Sylvester Stallones two Expendables films should have obviated -- action stars of yesterday fighting their obsolescence by going back to basics. But that of course was the problem with those movies Stallone wasnt sending up old action films; he was trying to revive dead or dying careers. Last month brought Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Last Stand and Stallone in Bullet to the Head and nobody cared. Willis at least is simply leaning on something familiar. Still you cant blame any of them. Theyve surveyed the landscape of action-star alternatives and seen no one younger who threatens them. Take this Jai Courtney. Hes a young physically fit Australian whos uncomfortably Tom Hardy-like (its the eyes lips and vaguely disguised non-American accent). But hes not anything else. I dont know that he could carry a franchise on his own. Almost no ones expected to now. The effects departments are the new stars. And the flesh-and-blood men who could carry an action movie -- the Hugh Jackmans Channing Tatums and Dwayne Johnsons -- are too good at other stuff to purely Stallone themselves. The version of the action movie that Willis and his ilk helped popularize is on its last legs. A jalopy like A Good Day to Die Hard merely italicizes its demise. Ladies its Valentines weekend. And some of you might want to spend part of it at the movies. Hollywood thinks its got two winners for you each based on a popular book and set in the South. The first is Safe Haven which began as a Nicholas Sparks novel and depending on how you take your romantic dramas is either the equivalent of a warm bath or a sink full of dishes. Sparks has cornered the market on love in sleepy seaside towns. The grubby tragedy of his first books (The Notebook A Walk to Remember) has morphed into the kind of New Age nonsense that when faithfully produced on screen can cause you to spit out your Pepsi. The glorious badness of Safe Haven comes from the way the veteran director Lasse Hallstrom applies the greeting-card tastefulness hes used for Whats Eating Gilbert Grape Something to Talk About The Cider House Rules Chocolat Dear John and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen to a movie whose punch line is so delightfully absurd that even after you pretty much know whats coming you spit out your Pepsi anyway. Julianne Hough plays a young woman who desperately flees Boston by bus hops off in Southport North Carolina and gives herself a new name (Katie) and haircut (Mary Stuart Masterson). She rents a great house gets a job at the local seafood shack makes pals with another single lady (a lifeless-looking Cobie Smulders) and falls for the hunky widower (Josh Duhamel) who runs The Only Store in Town. His name is Alex and he cant seem to understand why it takes so long for his hotness and the cuteness of his two kids to occur to her. But we know why. We have flashbacks. ""Katie"" is running from an abusive drunk (David Lyons) who we see in separate scenes harassing people for Katies whereabouts. You think you know where this is headed -- and youre mostly right. The abuser gets to Southport in time for the Fourth of July But theres more. This is the sort of movie (based on the sort of book) in which Alexs late wife took the time to write a letter to her children which theyre to open in their teenage years. Its the sort of movie in which she also bothered to pen one for ""the woman my husband loves"" or something like that. Theyve been written on paper that doesnt appear to burn in a house fire. And when Katie opens hers youll feel bad that you had to spit soda all over it. But theres no other choice What the letter implies is ridiculous. What the story pulls back to reveal at that moment -- and no I wont spoil it though you can probably guess -- is even more so. What the movie thinks is a loving piety is really just celestial dreariness saved up for a big plot twist. I dont know whod want to spend Valentines weekend this way with the Keyser Soze of seaside romance. Of course that would be vastly preferable to the other movie that opened on February 14. Its something called Beautiful Creatures in which a teenage Southerner falls for a girl who turns out to be a witch except because Beautiful Creatures is based on a series of young adult novels you cant call her a witch. You have to call her a ""Caster."" The boy Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) cant take things too far with the girl Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) because she wont quite let him. Lena lives with her extended family in a mansion that looks like the gothic version of the surrealist house in Beetlejuice. She hails from a line of powerful Casters and upon her 16th birthday shell be ready for The Reaping some kind of transformational rite in which her soul her fate or possibly her hair color will forever be ""dark or light."" And because the entire point of movies based on young adult fiction appears to be that nothing can be called what it is no one ever surmises that really all the Reaping seems to be is either a garden party for your period or a very public acknowledgment that you might have a mental illness. (It might also be both.) Beautiful Creatures is like the Twilight movies but with a chaperone making sure the boys dance a foot apart from the girls. (Twilight allows for heavy petting and then intercourse.) Its loosely like The Hunger Games but with nothing thoughtful to say about violence or popular culture or making something of yourself. The film feels very much the result of many people -- the novelists Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl; the writer and director Richard LaGravenese; the assortment of producers; and Warner Bros. -- taking stock of the young adult landscape and saying ""We can do that."" I would beg to differ. Very few movies based on so-called YA fiction is very good. The last two Twilight movies are difficult to watch in part because the filmmaking drags one minute and is on cocaine the next. But you at least believed that this hot girl wanted to do it so much with this one undead guy that shed risk her life. Its a stupid confused way to look at sex but at least it felt that way with a modicum of conviction. I dont know how Beautiful Creatures feels about anything. Theres no central drama or suspense. Theres no sexual tension or eroticism or real comedy (although the night I saw it the girls in the audience seemed to find Ehrenreich appealing). Theres some overwrought business involving Civil War reenactments and the alarming image of scars on Viola Daviss back which evokes a slave masters lash. But theyre glossed over in a way thats shocking coming from a man who helped turn Toni Morrisons Beloved into a movie. Its more stuff youre not allowed to call by its name. None of the actors at the center of the movie inspires anything close to enthusiasm. And there isnt one beautiful image in the whole film. The effects actually have a sludgy muddy quality so when Lena and her estranged Little Red Corvette of a sister (Emmy Rossum) have a shouting match that makes the dinner table rise up off the floor and spin around its like watching a pottery wheel lose its mind. The bright frilly costumes and makeup give naturalist actors like Eileen Atkins and Margo Martindale a creepiness they shouldnt have. (You havent felt truly sorry for an actor until youve seen Martindale in a big cottony wig. She looks like dessert.) Jeremy Irons appears to be enjoying himself as Lenas hammy uncle. Davis makes the most of whats basically another caretaker (her characters name is Amma which practically begs for rearrangement at the Soul Train Scramble Board) and Emma Thompson as Lenas evil mother attempts to tear the roof off the movie. Its unclear what shes going for but whatever it is its unserious which ought to win her something. Beautiful Creatures is what would happen if Tim Burton tried to film a William Faulkner novel as though it were Sabrina the Teenage Witch. (That makes either Irons or Davis the talking cat.) These movies -- and the so-called YA novels that inspire them -- wind up taking real adolescent experiences (losing your virginitys a big one) and larding it with all kinds of fantastical danger that perverts the actual meaning of that experience. The directness and piquancy in the music of Alanis Morissette Liz Phair PJ Harvey and Tori Amos have retarded into euphemisms for lust. The piss and vinegar of the 1990s have dried up. A decade later girls hormonal-emotional surrogates in books and movies arent getting mad even or straightforwardly laid. Theyre getting reaped.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Safe Haven Video Rated PG-13  115 minutes  2013 As often as Lasse Hallstrom has directed melodrama (Dear John Chocolat) he has yet to master the style; his films are excruciatingly self-serious in a genre that rewards good-natured uncouthness. In this adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks novel Hallstrom almost gets the formula right. A mysterious woman (Julianne Hough) skips town on a charter bus and winds up in a sleepy coastal community; she meets and falls for a man recently widowed (Josh Duhamel) but her past comes back to haunt her. Hallstrom flies in the face of narrative and thematic logic and keeping up with the movies inane plot twists makes for a capricious good time but an unimaginative denouement turns the whole thing into a fools errand.

We first meet Julianne Hough running for her life on the lam from a Boston bus terminal but is she fleeing an unknown assailant or is she herself a fugitive killer? David Lyonss twitchy cop wants the answer and we keep cutting back to his investigation as the movie plods through its Sparksian business. Hough arrives in a sleepy coastal community planning to keep herself to herself until glances are swapped over the counter at the general store where widower and single father Josh Duhamel bides his time until he is (ahem) ready to love again... Director Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules) whose recent output has been forgettable provides a bit of class by taking an age to manoeuvre this synthetic duo towards the kissing stuff (shamelessly hackneyed highlights include - no really - a sudden rainstorm). But none of this prepares us for a final reel which descends into the Vortex of Bonkers delivering fits of unexpected laughter. During those heavenly moments Safe Haven becomes a guilty pleasure yet theres much icky sincerity to wade through beforehand.

Todays films rarely end in either but dont tell that to Nicholas Sparks. The popular novelist has swallowed a formula give em pretty people with troubled relationships that usually span more than one time zone blending the present and the past and end with a sunset an embrace and a last-minute kiss. Safe Haven is the eighth moist Nicholas Sparks rom-com to land on the screen following in the footsteps of The Notebook and Dear John. This one blends the scented candles of a daytime soap with the tamer aspects of a middling thriller. Some folks will bring Kleenex. Others will need NoDoz. A mousy brunette holding a bloody butcher knife (Julianne Hough a dancer with scant experience from TVs Dancing with the Stars) flees a house in Boston in the pouring rain turns into a stunning blonde on her way to the bus station boards a bus for Atlanta and runs away from home pursued by a cop so obsessed he makes Russell Crowe in Les Miserables look like a security guard at a taping of Sesame Street. She gets as far as a sleepy beach town on the banks of North Carolina rents a shack in the woods as far from prying eyes as she can get changes her name to Katie and settles down with a good book to think analyze and regroup. But you know the drill. Purple sundowns and moss swaying from antebellum magnolias go just so far. In no time Katie meets Alex the towns most eligible single dad and camera-ready 8-by-10 (Josh Duhamel). Katie has a dark secret to hide (she may have committed a murder). Alex has a new start to make (hes a grieving widower who lost his wife to cancer and now has two kids to raise on his own). Its a match made in Technicolor. Katie also has a nosy neighbor named Jo (Cobie Smulders) who also seems to be hiding from something. While these people never come to life as anything more than stick figures shaped together with wire hangers and airplane glue they do indulge in daily rituals that prolong any threat of mounting suspense. Alex gives Katie a bike out of kindness. Katie paints her kitchen floor yellow. Alex and Katie go canoeing prance into the waves at the beach and get soaked in an unexpected downpour--nothing like uncomfortable wet clothes to edge a horny couple closer to warm sheets. In time she inadvertently helps him out of his emotional funk and fear of commitment. Then he sees her face on a wanted poster and its his turn to help her. But first theres the annual Fourth of July fireworks display and the arrival of the Boston cop who stalks her a fiend without a badge played by Australias David Lyons. Its an hour into the movie before we find out what the mystery is all about. But the biggest mystery of all is the identity of Katies friend Jo lending Safe Haven a spiritual component that wrecks the movie at the eleventh hour. After waiting so long to figure things out this is no time to turn phony. On the plus side the two leads are attractive enough to hold interest and the cinematography is predictable but lovely to look at. But the adaptation of the Sparks novel by Dana Stevens and Gage Lansky plods along with dialogue just above the level of crayon scribblings and the direction by the usually reliable Lasse Hallstrom is dismayingly sluggish. Modest is the word for Safe Haven. rreedobserver.com SAFE HAVEN Running Time 115 minutes Written by Leslie Bohem (screenplay) Dana Stevens (screenplay) and Nicholas Sparks (novel) Directed by Lasse Hallstrom Starring Julianne Hough Josh Duhamel and Cobie Smulders Comment Filed under movie Movie Review Rex Reed safe haven Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2013/02/low-tide-safe-haven-is-a-romantic-thriller-that-washes-out-before-sunset/,200,safehaven3,safehaven,com/2013/02/low-tide-safe-haven-is-a-romantic-thriller-that-washes-out-before-sunset/

Warning this review totally spoils the batshit ending of the latest Nicholas Sparks weepy romance. By Amy Nicholson Feb. 15 2013 This review completely spoils Safe Haven. Like as soon as the first paragraph. Youve been warned. A Nicholas Sparks movie needs three things a beach a babe and a bro. Safe Haven delivers the Holy Trinit - a sacrament that guarantees a hot and heavy date nigh - and then drives the whole movie off a bridge like Sparks has gotten so bored with his seaside weepies that he shrugged and said ""Screw it lets throw in a ghost."" His latest panty-dropper starts bloody as though Sparks accidentally stapled a spec script for SVU to his newest scribbles when he sent them off to his agent. Erin (Julianne Hough) her heaving chest smeared in gore runs barefoot through the streets wailing ""What have I done?"" A quick haircut and bleach job later shes fleeing Boston - and the abusive husband she just stabbed - on a bus headed south. As soon as she crosses the Mason-Dixon line director Lasse Hallstrom an official Sparks sellout cuts to golden sunshine and country music so the audience can sigh with relief that they didnt buy a ticket to the wrong movie. On her tail is Officer Tierney (David Lyons) and to make sure we stay sympathetic to our killer heroine and not you know the law Safe Haven makes him a cross between Bad Lieutenant and the T-1000. (Christopher Dorners family should hire Hallstrom to direct his heroic biopic.) Tierney swills vodka from a water bottle sleeps overnight at the crime scene breaks into old ladies houses nearly runs over a teenager and reeks booze sweat like the second coming of Charles Bukowski. And those are the least of his crimes. Eventually were given a reason for his insanity. Alas its too late - weve already wasted two acts thinking the filmmakers must be a pack of mouth-breathing morons. Our romance starts when Erin impulsively gets off the bus in a coastal North Carolina hamlet renames herself Katie and buys a coffee from widowed dad Alex (Josh Duhamel) who runs the corner store. She charms his moppet daughter (Mimi Kirkland) he gives her a used bicycle and then they go to the beach and check out each others abs. Their love story has a mellow eas - as neither of them has much of a personality were just watching two swell people decide to bone. It almost feels voyeuristic as Duhamel has the snub-nosed Archie Comics good looks of Houghs real-life boyfriend Ryan Seacrest. Squint and imagine him showered and its almost like youre spying on her real life. Though shes meant to be a battered wife after their first few meetings Katie is as trusting as a puppy. For someone whos prone to nightmares she makes the ill-considered choice to rent a secluded cabin in the woods. Her reluctance to open up to her only neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders of The Avengers) doesnt seem like the result of years of abuse but just the result of hiding from the cop - and of the fact that Jo a sad sack like herself is a kind of a lonely creepster who wasnt lucky enough to fall in insta-love with a local hunk. Instead she spends her time peeking into peoples windows and sighing Single White Female things to her sole friend like ""You deserve this."" Safe Haven shamelessly riffs off of Sparks biggest hit The Notebook. Theres a romantic canoe ride a sudden rainstorm a quirky first slow dance and lots of shots of the dude hoisting the girl in the air. But it lacks The Notebooks angry heat. In that Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were violently viciously in love - watch it again (or for the first time if youre going to pretend you havent seen it) and count the number of times McAdams slaps him in the face. Here when Duhamel discovers that Hough is wanted for murder hes merely peevish as if his barista gave him the wrong latte. Their fumbled big moments are a waste of two slightly-better-than-average screen stars which is a different thing than calling them serious actors. Duhamels spent his career as fifth banana in big franchises and deserves more than to spend his life as Mr. Fergalicious. As for Hough a former hoofer on Dancing With the Stars shed be the biggest name in Hollywood if she could get time-traveled back to 1935 an era when we expected our stars to have skills. Straight-forward and approachable she makes for a sturdier heroine than the rest of Sparks doomed beauties. Hough even looks like she could drink a beer which in this country is a prerequisite for running for president. Add in the humble setting and the approximately 8000 American flags Hallstrom a Swede sneaks into the background (he even sets the climax during the frigging Fourth of July) and Safe Haven feels downright blue collar. Thats weirdly rare in romance movies. Most Hollywood love stories make the heroine teeter around in spike heels and pencil skirts doing a very glamorous job that no one can explain. Not only is the love itself totally unattainable so is the real estate. There are no six-figure lofts in Safe Haven and theres a lesson in there for filmmakers audiences dont love a Nicholas Sparks movie because theyre stupid. They love it because its real or at least real enough that they can see a reflection of themselves in it if they just had the courage to buy that bus ticket or smile at that stranger. And then in the last five minutes all of that realistic romance gets suffocated Fatty Arbuckle-style. In the looniest twist in Sparks oeuvre - which is saying a lot for a guy who specializes in secret letters and convenient cancer - after Katie and Alexs last big kiss she reads a note his dead wife wrote before she croaked and realizes that her clingy friend Jo is more than just the miserablist foil for what happens if you move to the South and dont dye your hair blonde. Jo is--gasp--the ghost of Alexs dead wife. And she like totally supports them falling in love. In flashbacks Katie realizes that all those times she walked through the woods with her new weird friend she was actually alone and rambling to herself. This raises a couple questions Is Katie insane? Did Ghost Jo know she was going to hook up with her ex from the beginning? Is she a psychic ghost? When Ghost Jo left town and hinted she was moving to Europe is Europe Heaven? If Europe is Heaven does that mean that Belinda Carlisle was right when she said Heaven is a place on Earth? Will Nicholas Sparks pull an L. Ron Hubbard and reveal that his novels are actually the precursor texts to a new religion? Hey girl Id totally read The Gospel According to Ryan Gosling. But even among Sparks questionable canon Safe Haven is a minor text.

Photo Credit James Bridges By MICHAEL GRANBERRY mgranberrydallasnews.com Staff Writer Published 14 February 2013 0303 PM Updated 14 February 2013 0303 PM OK admit it we all have our guilty pleasures. One of mine is the cinematic fluff made from the novels of Nicholas Sparks. Ive read none of his books but have willingly gone to several of the films which Ill admit are as sappy as the tree in my grandmas yard.I liked Message in a Bottle Nights in Rodanthe and The Lucky One. And judging by the stars who appear in films generated from Sparks novels Im not the only one who appreciates the romantic melodramas that ensue from his purple prose. They include the likes of Paul Newman Robin Wright Kevin Costner Richard Gere Diane Lane Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling. Even this film is directed by the esteemed Lasse Hallstrom (Chocolat Whats Eating Gilbert Grape The Shipping News).The latest confection perfect for date night is Safe Haven derived from a Sparks novel about a woman with a mysterious past who ends up in the coastal bliss of Southport N.C. Yep shes on the run and we dont know why until well into this sudsy soap opera which operates like a cross between Love Story and The Fugitive all the way down to the hair dye used to create a new identity.Julianne Hough is quite fetching as the tormented Katie and Josh Duhamel who plays the guy she falls for in the town of her relocation is good on many levels. Women will love his hunky persona and his vulnerability as a father grieving over his wifes death and sharing that with his kids is among the more touching elements. The child actors are absolutely terrific.But this is melodrama with a capital M like all the films made from Sparks novels so the last thing this one needed was an utterly ridiculous plot point near the end to make it even more of one. Its as though the filmmakers lacked the confidence to stick with the basic story which served every element needed in a Sparks-infused guilty pleasure.SAFE HAVEN(C+) Directed by Lasse Hallstrom.

And then the rest of the movie happens. 51 Shares Share 40 Tweet 8 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough in Safe Haven Photo James Bridges/Relativity Media For one brief glorious moment during Safe Haven you can see the movie it could have been. It happens early on during the budding romance between mysterious fugitive Katie (Julianne Hough) and young small-town widower dad Alex (Josh Duhamel). Theyve gone on an impromptu trip to the beach with Alexs kids in tow and the two lie in the sun talking. In close-up their hands caress the sand the way they (and we) wish they could one another. At one point their bare shoulders touch. Neither of them remarks on it even though we know theyre both very much aware of it. Its a subtle but breathtaking moment. Then the rest of the movie happens. Adapted from the novel by Nicholas Sparks the story mixes the authors typically swoony melodramatics with a light sprinkling of noir. We first see Katie as she desperately flees from a cop (David Lyons) who is angrily pursuing her. She boards a bus and makes her way down South to a small coastal South Carolina town where she cuts and dyes her hair blonde. Then she proceeds to hit it off with local grocery-store owner Alex who is still reeling from the loss of his wife some years before. He brings her small-town normalcy and comfort. She brings him out of his shell and Teaches Him To Love Again(tm). Meanwhile Katies alcoholic violent police pursuer back in Boston remains dogged in his attempts to find her. (By the way hes so alcoholic that when he breaks into other peoples homes looking for clues about Katies whereabouts he makes sure to drink their Scotch as well.) And we can sort of see why he wont stop looking for her Hes her husband. The film treats this as if its a twist but it breaks the first rule of a proper twist If its something all the relevant characters in the movie already know its not a twist; its simply a lazy cheap screenwriting trick. As noted previously the movies not all bad. Theres palpable chemistry between Duhamel and Hough. The former particularly seems well-suited to this sort of thing He has just the right amount of grizzled charm to be one of those wounded hunks Sparks likes so much. For her part Hough who built her fame on Dancing With the Stars is a mixed bag. She cant seem to emote very well but she moves convincingly and shes actually compelling as a desperate fugitive on the run. For some of the films charms we should also credit director Lasse Hallstrom. Over the years he has become the poster boy for promising foreign filmmakers who come to the U.S. and make their career churning out tepid product. He was definitely one to watch back in Sweden when he broke out in 1987 with the powerful coming-of-age film My Life As a Dog. His American work mostly mainstream soft-focus fare like Whats Eating Gilbert Grape Chocolat The Cider House Rules and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen has been uneven but he still has considerable strengths. He brings to these occasionally opportunistic melodramas an attention to craft atmosphere and performance that they dont always deserve. And so too with Safe Haven -- at least until the movie begins to drown in the telenovela-level crud that its been building up to all along. We genuinely like watching Hough and Duhamel circling around one another and the movie has a nice sense of place. That all eventually vanishes with a doozy of a third act that involves Katies hubby finally making his way back into their lives and a ridiculous action finale. Oh and one final twist (this time an actual twist which I wont give away) that will either make you break out in holy Sparks-ian tears or make you burn the theater down. Come to think of it youll probably want to do both.

James Bridges/Relativity Media/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Top 10 highest paid authors of 2011 Monitor Movie Guide The latest Nicholas Sparks-derived weepfest ""Safe Haven"" is being marketed as a Valentines Day special but the plot line is closer to a stalker thriller. Its sudsy-scary. Its also not very good although this may not matter to its core audience. Its director Lasse Hallstrom has objected to the term ""chick flick"" but if the shoe fits...Hes right to think of the term as limiting though. No one would seriously call a Jane Austen novel ""chick lit."" ""Safe Haven"" is a species of Gothic chick flick Running-from-danger heroine (Julianne Hough) finds friendly anonymity - and a hunky widower (Josh Duhamel) with two cute kids - in a sleepy North Carolina town. In pursuit is a rabid policeman (David Lyons) who practically froths at the mouth. At least he doesnt turn into a werewolf or a vampire.

The only real shocker is how well Julianne Hough comes off throughout - its easily her finest performance - but the quicksand nature of the story beneath her feet would sabotage even the heartiest of acting efforts. Hough doesnt stand a chance against shoddy pacing horrific editing and plot direction disastrous enough to make your toes curl. Even when compared against other films that have been adapted from Nicholas Sparks novels ""Safe Haven"" is terrible. We open with Katie (Hough) running around with a plastic bug her image diced apart with a mess of dimply lit flash cuts. Shes trying to escape from someone or something eventually escaping onto a nearby bus feverishly looking around with paranoia. Who is chasing her? The cops The bus departs leaving the fuzz in her wake. Katie disembarks in beautiful Southport North Carolina finds a job and begins the slow process of piecing her life back together. As the film lumbers on the audience is treated to flashbacks that detail what exactly went wrong why shes on the run and what it is that pursuing her throughout the nearly two-hour running time. The only other story direction involves the go-hard Detective Tierney (David Lyons). Hes obsessed with finding Katie and his character development is handled with genius level dialogue such as ""No one is innocent."" Detective Tierney is working nights and weekends in order to bring our main character to justice. Thats pretty much all we see of him a fella tracking down leads running roughshod over The Fourth Amendment and generally indicating hes the absolute worst sort of person. In one of the most hilarious scenes this side of ""The Hangover"" Detective Tierney attempts to track the path of the bus Katie boarded using surveillance footage from the night of her exodus and he starts asking questions about where all the busses go. Its an amazing thing to watch this detective realizing that - why - busses go all over America. Katie could be anywhere I suppose they cut out the part where Tierney was beamed down from an alternate galaxy that no one knows how basic travel works in because everyone with a functioning frontal lobe realizes that once you leave one place all other places are then open to your journey. Sigh. Katie starts forming relationships in Southport though shes initially reluctant because she might have to take flight at the slightest hint of danger. Still this little duckling begins to fly again and its not long before shes soaring into the arms of a local widower named Alex (Josh Duhamel). As an audience were okay to root for these two crazy kids to succeed because life has killed off Alexs spouse leaving behind only rock-hard abs and a sensitive giving man. Dont roll your eyes just yet as even stupider moments are headed down the pike. It slowly becomes clear why Detective Tierney is hunting Katie down in such an obsessive manner and this informs the entire third act completing the transformation of ""Safe Haven"" into a Lifetime Movie of the Week. Truly there might have been a decent rom-com buried within if the entire ""pursuit"" angle had been excised but well never know because everyone involved was too busy loading up the cheese truck to dump on ""Safe Haven"". No logical question is ever answered and Katie lives in a world where you can get a job without ID buy a house without ID and where loved ones leave you completely alone if it serves the purpose of faux tension within the script. There are very few moments of ""Safe Haven"" that arent dripping with melodrama leaving an audience free to check out to think about their grocery list. As the film reaches its crescendo it becomes apparent that director Lasse Hallstrom will stop at nothing to grab your interest even if that grabbing involves actively insulting your intelligence. As everything plays out in the exact way it would if you had ten minutes to write a screenplay you start rooting for most of the characters to trip and hit their head. They do not do this so feel free to skip this monster. Yes indeed the opening scene of ""Safe Haven"" features Hough running with a plastic bag but its we who should have run and the script that should have been placed into a plastic bag.

Dixie states have been the settings for all of the movie adaptations of Nicholas Sparkss corn-syrupy novels but Safe Haven the first to mix in thriller elements appears to have traveled even farther south landing in a writers room for a telenovela that even Mexican broadcasters might consider too outlandish. As the reasons why Katie is wanted for murder are being parceled out the guarded Yankee transplant begins to soften around general-store proprietor Alex (Josh Duhamel) a widower raising two young kids who seem to exist solely for the purpose of being imperiled. Safe Haven director Lasse Hallstrom helmed an earlier Sparks-sourced production 2010s Dear John which was buoyed by the heat generated by Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried but here he is unable to ignite any electric connection between the leads. Hough emits all the charisma of a personal assistant a mien as dull and blunt as the address of a letter (its not a Sparks film without a healing epistle) left by a beneficent ghost for which Katie is the intended recipient To Her.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> How much do I hate this movie? Let me count the ways. I hate the way Hollywood insults audiences by deciding a film version of a Nicholas Sparks bestseller is what audiences need for Valentines week. I hate the way Sparks-inspired films have gotten exponentially worse since 2004s The Notebook. You want titles? Try Dear John The Last Song and The Lucky One. I hate that Lasse Hallstrom the indisputable talent behind My Life As a Dog Whats Eating Gilbert Grape and The Cider House Rules got suckered into directing this swill. I hate how nothing about Safe Haven makes sense. I mean you have to hate this story Katie (Julianne Hough) has fled Boston by bus with a psycho cop (David Lyons) and a first-degree murder rap nipping at her heels. And yet Hough an inexhaustibly perky actress manages to keep smiling. Worse then that Katie hides out in an impossibly picturesque fishing village in North Carolina where she right away meets Alex (Josh Duhamel) a widower with two kids and a gym-toned body no one else in town possesses. As time wears on and on I keep ignoring Katies fate and wondering where she and Alex go to get their highlights. I hate the intolerably cutsey dialogue that draws this Ken and Barbie together. I hate the blandness of Hough and Duhamel as actors. No human emotion seems to register on their perfect faces for more than a second at a time. I hate how Hallstrom arranges them like hes shooting a spread for smallo-town Vogue. I hate to the point of despising the friendship Katie develops with Jo (Cobie Smulders) a neighbor no one else in town seems to mention. I hate the Sixth Sense vibe that attempts to energize a film that died soon after the opening credits. Flashbacks hint at Kates dark secrets. But Hough ends every assault on Katie be it attempted rape or murder with a delicious crinkle of her nose that signals all traumas can be solved with the rightmakeup hair and lighting. I hate Safe Haven. Its a terrible thing to do to your Valentine. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Feb. 14 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 15 2013 1218PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Lasse Hallstrom Written by Dana Stevens from a Nicholas Sparks novel Starring Julianne Hough Josh Duhamel Classification PG Genre romance Year 2013 Country USA Language English The good ship cinema pulls in once again to the Nicholas Sparks Port of Abject Sentimentality - hey it must be Valentines Day. Since this is the eighth novel by the esteemed Sparks to make such a journey not to mention the second time that director Lasse Hallstrom has served as captain and since authoritative sources assure me that the previous expeditions ""have amassed a cumulative worldwide gross of nearly three-quarters of a billion dollars"" its hard to argue with the title here - Safe Haven indeed. This is all about safety in the Hollywood workplace. Why make a movie when making a Hallmark-card-with-dialogue is so much less risky? Screen grab from an online trailer for the film ""Safe Haven"" Movies Safe Haven The official trailer With dialogue and of course with pretty faces too. Preferably the fresh-scrubbed kind that in this case belong to Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel. Shes Katie the damsel in opening-scene distress whom we first see under a hoodie escaping on a bus at night in the rain. In short Exit pursued by an abusive bear of a husband.Entrance the following morning in tiny Southport on the picturesque coast of North Carolina. No abusive bears there. Just fresh-scrubbed Josh as Alex the fresh-scrubbed widower with his two pretty kids and his pretty general store and a late wife so pretty that she gets resurrected for occasional guest appearances. At first Katie is guarded and hes charming. Then hes more charming and Katie is less guarded. So cue up Pastel Montage No. 1 with Sappy Soundtrack Accompaniment.Ensconced in her fixer-upper cabin itself ensconced in a sylvan glade Katie paints the floors a sunshine yellow which by happy coincidence is precisely the hue of most everything that follows. Like the family trip to the beach where Katie and Alex and the kiddies gambol in the sun and frolic in the waves until the moment arrives for Pastel Montage No. 2 with ... oh need I go on?Okay Ill go on much like that abusive hubby who courtesy of some deft tacking by Captain Hallstrom can be intermittently glimpsed closing in on Katies safe haven - he and his black hat threatening to stain all the bright yellow. But not before romance blooms. Actually since this particular Hallmark-card-with-dialogue clocks in at 115 essentially plotless minutes romance is obliged to take its own sweet time blooming.Thats why Katie has to catch a fish which she offers to an appreciative Alex. Then he has to say ""Do you want to go canoeing with me"" and they paddle. And then post-paddle they dance and post-dance they almost kiss and post kiss-manque they really smooch - albeit behind a tree. Later I think they go beyond kissing but thats just a guess because Captain Hallstrom gets very tricky at this delicate point trading in the yellow for discreet shadows that hide the naughty bits and make it hard to see what the hells going on. Your trusty reporter can only confirm the presence of a bed of two seemingly pretty shapes upon it and the consequent arrival of Pastel Montage No. 3. You figure it out.Meanwhile the black hat is fast approaching as is the Fourth of July which means literal fireworks followed by a literal fire - perhaps not surprising from a guy named Sparks. Theres also a letter. Theres always a letter stuffed into these Hallmark cards. This one comes at the end along with a complementary hankie and a red candy heart. Such a nice gesture. Which I suppose makes Safe Haven the perfect Valentines date - instead of dinner and a movie dinner and a gesture.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review Safe Haven Something Borrowed Something Boo Julianne Hough plays the girl on the run in a pallid knock-off of Sleeping with the Enemy By Mary Pols MaryPolsFeb. 14 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle James Bridges / Safe Haven Productions / Relativity Media Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The 1991 film Sleeping with the Enemy featured Julia Roberts as Laura Burney a nice young woman trying to restart her life after escaping an abusive and controlling husband. Living under an assumed identity Laura finds love in a town bucolic enough to have a Fourth of July day parade although the bad husband eventually shows up and memorably tidies up her bathroom (most women dream of this) before tries to kill her and her new beau. The movie was an adaptation of a novel by Nancy Prince. In Safe Haven Lasse Hallstroms second adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks book (the first was 2010s Dear John) cute Katie (Julianne Hough) goes through almost exactly the same motions although absent any compulsive towel straightening and with the addition of a supernatural twist. The movies are so alike its a wonder someone hasnt sued although it seems unlikely that Hough is on the kind of trajectory Roberts fresh off Pretty Woman was at that point. Not to heap praise on Sleeping with the Enemy but of all the movies Roberts made in her 20s none exploited her talent for displaying vulnerability more effectively than this TV-movie woman-in-peril thriller. Hough sturdy and placid is no trembling doe on the run and she fails to make Katie compelling or even interesting. The greatest concern Safe Haven evokes is for the innocents around her who may suffer at the hands of the brutish police detective (David Lyons) chasing her. (READ TIMEs interview with Julianne Hough) Katie arrives in Southport North Carolina via an Atlanta-bound bus having escaped some domestic mess in Boston--an unidentified man is left bloodied on a floor as a brunette Katie flees to an older womans house. By the time she boards the bus shes a blonde with a buttery bob (her boxed dye produces gorgeous highlights) and clutching a plastic bag full of clothes. Katie has no particular destination but she finds something warm and inviting in Southport. How could anyone resist a seaside town where a cup of Ethiopian coffee costs only 97 cents and is served up by someone as handsome as Josh Duhamel? He runs the general store but his character Alex is presented with such reality-bending contrivance they should call it a convenience store. Hes a widower father to outgoing little girl Lexie (Mimi Kirkland) and sullen son Josh (Noah Lomax) both in clear need of a maternal figure in their lives. Katie initially resists Alexs advances but she and Lexie immediately become fast friends. Starting over in Southport seems easy Katie finds waitressing work with minimal effort and a fully furnished cottage in the woods. Her only neighbor is Jo (Cobie Smolders) who encourages Katie to give Alex a chance; when Katie refuses the bike he very nicely leaves out for her its Jo who gently advises her to take it ""its a bike not a kidney."" Apologies to Hallstrom but an adaptation of a Sparks novel always ends up being a Sparks movie. The skilled director casts a pleasing glow over the proceedings but hes boxed into the now-familiar Sparksian tropes. Homes including Katies twee shack are fetishized into nearly the same importance as the gorgeous actors. Kissing in the rain is a must as is a romp on a sandy beach. A post-dinner dance  (in a conveniently empty and softly lit restaurant) is a prelude to tasteful love making. All this fun stuff involving picture perfect humans is interspersed with quick cuts to scenes in Boston where Detective Tierney gloomily investigates Katies disappearance. He too is uncannily handsome but from the way he guzzles vodka scowls at surveillance tapes and cavalierly waves his police badge around there can be no doubt that he is bad to the bone. Yet no one is likely to worry much about the eventual outcome. Hough projects a bland durability in the role; the only puzzle about capable sensible Katie is why she would have put up with her spousal abuse as long as she did. (READ TIMES review of Dear John) Whats the point then if shes not a girl were desperately worried about? This could be a problem with Houghs performance--shes all sunshine but no heat--but in general Sparks seems to taking it easier on his audiences these days. Hes making his escapism more escapist. In his earlier career he was in the beautiful-people-dying-young business nimbly knitting up saccharine takes on Love Story. He killed off one of his principals in The Notebook A Walk to Remember and who can forget the way he tossed Kevin Costners character overboard in Message in a Bottle? In more recent years the prolific author has moved on to more palatable deaths a sick dad or a brother say rather than picking off the lovers who kiss in the rain. In Safe Haven hes figured out a way to maximize the sentimentality from one of these peripheral deaths with a supernatural twist. Its maudlin but effective. The man is a cultural magpie capable of borrowing from a 1991 Julia Roberts flick and M. Night Shyamalan in one fell swoop. Hell never get an award for originality but when it comes to rehashing formula and pleasing his audience the man is a master.

Safe Haven (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Safe Haven (PG-13) Director Lasse Hallstroms earnest romance is better than Nicholas Sparks source novel. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com2/14/2013 Editor rating 3 Lasse Hallstroms new film does exactly what an adaptation should It turns the original materials greatest flaws into assets. Safe Haven based on Nicholas Sparks bestselling novel is a sentimental romantic thriller. But its a well-made sentimental romantic thriller and that makes all the difference. The film follows the path of a desperate young woman (Julianne Hough of Rock of Ages) whom we first see rushing from a house in which something violent has happened. She eludes an angry Boston cop at the station and escapes on a bus heading south. Eventually she gets off for a bathroom break in the pretty North Carolina town of Southport -- the movie was filmed there -- and impulsively decides to stay. She finds a job and a house to rent easily (the film skims over these issues swiftly which is ideal for the pacing but raises the question of where she got so much cash while fleeing in terror). She introduces herself to her new neighbor (Cobie Smulders) as Katie though thats not her name. She also meets Alex a handsome shop owner (Josh Duhamel definitely worth getting off the bus for) with two young kids. Hes widowed; his wife died of cancer because someone always does in a Sparks novel. Katie wants to keep her distance but really who could? The courtship between the couple makes up most of Safe Haven. Interspersed with the blossoming of their romance are scenes that focus on the cop (David Lyons) who seems to be growing ever more frantic. The balance between the two plotlines is crucial and Hallstrom (Salmon Fishing in the Yemen) rearranges the books chronology a bit to keep the film moving in the right direction. The love story uses natural elements to reveal the nature of the unfolding relationship; scenes are either bathed in drowsy sunlight or drowned in fierce rainstorms signaling the characters changing moods. Short flashbacks pop up at the perfect intervals just enough to keep the audience interested if not guessing. Safe Haven is more date movie than thriller so if its hardcore action you seek look elsewhere. Hallstrom directed Dear John which was also based on a Sparks novel and has adapted films from novels before -- notably The Shipping News and The Cider House Rules. The novels on which those films were based (by Annie Proulx and John Irving respectively) were far more complex than Sparks Safe Haven. But that simplicity works in Hallstroms favor here; theres nothing that has to be left out for expediencys sake no reason to stretch the film beyond the two-hour mark. He puts together the film in a way that lends power to moments that might have seemed hard to believe otherwise making Safe Haven a safe bet for anybody craving romance.

They were made for children with the pages divided in thirds and every time you turned another section a different part of a face would appear. Beards grew bushy eyebrows disappeared -- a single simple character could morph into hundreds. I wonder if Nicholas Sparks has figured out a way to do the same thing with plots. He writes one best-seller after another almost all of which become hit films -- from ""Message in a Bottle"" to ""The Notebook"" to ""The Lucky One."" But theyre mix-and-match jobs the combinations drawn from a limited number of options. An untimely death a brooding man a fragile woman a big storm discreet sex a child in jeopardy a violent ex a pretty town on the North Carolina coast -- just chose a few mix them up and you have a new story. Sort of. ""Safe Haven"" is the latest and it hits the usual notes. Julianne Hough is a mysterious young woman fleeing a violent crime -- and ending up in a too-cute-for-words seaport down South. Where she eventually ends up in the arms of the disarming Josh Duhamel. Dont worry -- trouble will find them. But dont worry too much -- happiness will prevail. The casting feels a little budget conscious; this is the sort of movie with plenty of room for crusty characters and familiar faces but the supporting players seem to have been chosen with cost in mind. Which is a false economy because when Duhamel and Hough are your top-line stars theres obviously some money to spend for a big guest star or two or even some better-than-generic pop for the soundtrack. But Duhamel is a perfectly pleasant leading man scruffy enough to be realistic without heading into grungy. And Hough is a quietly vulnerable charmer like a younger softer Jennifer Aniston. And boy I bet thats a sentence Jennifer Aniston isnt going to be happy to come across on a Google search. That by this point the Sparks formula feels familiar isnt the worst problem; sometimes familiarity breeds content too. (Horror films are formulaic and action pictures too and you dont hear the mostly male critical army complaining too often about their cliches.) No the problem with the romantic ""Safe Haven"" isnt that it plays it safe but that it plays it cheap. Its also about 10 minutes too long. And theres a final twist that well if you have any popcorn left by the scene youll want to throw it at the screen. Still it works well enough -- harmlessly enough -- that it will undoubtedly make its money back especially on a Valentines Day weekend when there arent many other romantic choices out there. And it probably will make enough that the Nicholas Sparks Flip Book will turn out yet another one within months. Ratings note The film contains violence alcohol abuse and sexual situations. Safe Haven (PG-13) Relativity (115 min.) Directed by Lasse Hallstrom. With Josh Duhamel Julianne Hough.

Slideshow 8th Sparks novel hits screen Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Safe Haven >> A young woman bursts out of a house running. She fights her way through the heavy rain running always running as police cars lights and sirens wailing follow. The runner is Katie an elegant slim troubled haunted woman whose distress fear and anxiety are palpable. She gives the cops the slip and boards the first bus she can find. Played with welcome diligence if not enough dramatic confidence by Julianne Hough Katie disembarks the Atlanta-bound bus when it pulls in for a pit stop at a pretty coastal town in North Carolina. She buys a coffee at the local market from a crotchety-yet-supremely-handsome-and-tall man and decides to stay. Theres already a spark in Katies first meeting with Alex the shop owner the mysterious if somewhat morose dreamboat played by Josh Duhamel. Alex has a past as tragic as Katies - his wife the love of his life died recently leaving Alex to raise their two small children. Our hearts swell (or so the filmmakers hope) then and there just a few minutes into the picture as we realize that Katie and Alex are destined for each other. Our hearts sink when we find out from hazy flashbacks that Katie may be a murderer. We sink further when we realize shes being doggedly pursued by an angry obsessive cop (David Lyons). Why is he so fixated on Katie? Shot in Southport N.C. an idyllic hamlet of 1000 Safe Haven is the eighth Sparks novel (of 16) produced for the screen (fear not he has plans for the other eight). And its the second directed by Swedish-born master craftsman Lasse Hallstrom who also did Dear John. Like its equally weepy predecessors its a pretty-looking wonderfully facile bit of emotional froth thats likely to clean up at the box office. Not one of Sparks best flicks (The Notebook is quite good) Safe Haven is marred by film cliches. It has an alarming number of throwaway montage sequences - Katie painting her kitchen floor; Alex putting the kids to bed - set to weepy singer-songwriter fare by Colbie Caillat Dar Williams and Amos Lee. And it ends regrettably with two plot twists you can see coming a mile away. Contact staff writer Tirdad Derakhshani at 215-854-2436 or tirdadphillynews.com.

Starring Josh Duhamel Julianne Hough David Lyons Cobie Smulders Director Lasse Hallstrom Running time 155 Release Opened Feb 14 2013  Editorial Review Safe Haven cant hide from its sappy flawed plot By Ann HornadayThursday February 14 2013Hoping to re-bottle the lightning captured in ""The Notebook"" and ""Dear John"" romance packager Nicholas Sparks has given his usual formula some sharp edges in ""Safe Haven."" The film which stars Julianne Hough as a woman on the run from a troubled past opens like a gritty thriller complete with furtive looks from under a hoodie a taut chase through a crowded bus station and a few smidgens of blood. Soon enough Houghs character Katie has fetched up in the quaint North Carolina town of Southport where Sparkss seductive fantasy of self-reinvention takes place. Quiet and wary Katie still has elbows sharp enough to keep curious neighbors at bay at least until an appealing widower named Alex (Josh Duhamel) manages to charm his way past her chilly reserve. From Lasse Hallstrom director of ""Dear John"" this movie doesnt come close to generating the sparks that made Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling such breakout stars in ""The Notebook."" Hough and Duhamel are attractive enough (someone should cast Hough and Meg Ryan in a mother-daughter drama right now) and they possess an unforced ease when theyre together but their chance encounters and cautious romantic toe-dipping add up to little more than a pretty bore. (The film comes most genuinely to life when Hough and Duhamel are joined by the beguiling Mimi Kirkland who plays Alexs precocious daughter with welcome brio.) When a figure from Katies past shows up ""Safe Haven"" takes on the menacing contours of a slightly safer ""Cape Fear."" (This villain is so dastardly hes not above smashing a booze bottle on a Fourth of July parade float.) Even with Hallstroms soporific pacing and uneven tonal approach ""Safe Haven"" presents viewers with the undemanding easy-on-the-eyes escapism that may not qualify as high art but has pride of place in the commercial cinematic canon. Once Katies worlds collide though the film descends into maudlin melodrama which in turn slides into utter ridiculousness with a preposterous plot twist. ""Safe Haven"" is one of those Valentines Day confections that satisfy your sweet tooth until you get to their weird off-putting center. The problem with movies is that you cant put them back in the box.Contains thematic material sexuality threatening behavior and violence.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Breaking from the expected formula of sunsets walks on the beach and terminal cancer--though all three are present in some capacity--Safe Haven the latest from Nicholas Sparks line of picture-postcard cheese bills itself as a ""romantic thriller"" which adds an element of danger and intrigue to the spectacle of pretty people finding each other. Its tempting to say those two elements go together like oil and water but the film barely attempts to integrate them at all until the third act. Before then Safe Haven is a McDLT on the hot side a gauzy love affair between a woman seeking refuge on the North Carolina coast and a handsome widower with two kids; on the cool a police procedural about a hard-living detective on a quest to track her down for murder. And much as with the McDLT the two sides come together in an unappetizing fashion. The pulse-pounding opening--in the sense that one has to have a pulse to experience it--has Julianne Hough dashing incognito to the first bus out of town pursued by a detective (David Lyons) whos determined to apprehend her. Hough wends her way to the quiet idyllic coastal town of Southport North Carolina where she takes a job waitressing at a seaside restaurant and retreats to a rustic fixer-upper in the woods. But determined as she is to be alone no woman is an island and she quickly befriends an advice-giving neighbor (How I Met Your Mothers Cobie Smulders) and the devastatingly handsome widower (Josh Duhamel) who runs the general store. Meanwhile the detective wants her for the first-degree murder of her abusive husband and will stop at nothing to throw this doe-eyed maniac behind bars before she kills again. Director Lasse Hallstrom whose promising early films (My Life As A Dog Whats Eating Gilbert Grape) have led to unthreatening later ones (Salmon Fishing In The Yemen the previous Sparks adaptation Dear John) is far more comfortable with romantic fantasy than generic cop-thriller material. Theres some theoretical appeal to the story of two emotionally damaged people learning to love again--""theoretical"" because the film needs better actors than Hough and Duhamel and richer conversation than a shared enthusiasm for kale. But the cutaways to this cop-on-the-edge plot are jarring and lacking in conviction and when the whole tortured mess comes together in a twist-filled third act Safe Haven becomes a full-blown calamity. Theres some novelty in the biggest twist though Its only tangentially related to cancer.

Photo AP Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel are oh so adorable in the sickeningly sweet Valentines Day date movie ""Safe Haven."" (AP) In a world that allows for the existence of Chris Brown subway pushers and freakish superstorms at least you can always escape into a Nicholas Sparks romance where the men are strong and true the neighbors are all kindly matchmakers and a downpour is just Gods gentle way of encouraging you to make out. Adapting the authors cornball formula for a second time around is once-ambitious director Lasse Hallstrom (""Dear John"") who delivers a cinematic valentine youll be reasonably content to watch on a flight in a year or so. ""Safe Haven"" opens as a panicked young woman (Julianne Hough) hops a bus and randomly disembarks in the seaside hamlet of Southport N.C. hoping for a clean slate thatll erase her mysterious possibly criminal past. At the general store she meets widowed owner Alex (Josh Duhamel) whose young daughter (Mimi Kirkland the films best performance) helps her pick out cheerful yellow paint for the floor of her rented cottage. Which shes able to afford even though everything she owns appears to fit into a plastic bag and she hasnt yet started her part-time waitressing job at the local seafood shack but -- wait this is Sparks country No hair-splitting allowed Houghs character Katie has one gratifying moment of not playing by romantic-gesture movie rules She balks at Alexs leaving a gift bicycle outside her house in the dead of night. Which is a little stalkery even if youre not a traumatized woman fleeing the law. ""I didnt ask for it and I dont want it"" she tells him annoyed. (Just imagine Lloyd Doblers radio serenade being dismissed this way or Edward Cullens ""I like watching you sleep"" shtick.) But of course Katie gradually loses her jumpiness and learns to accept Alexs small-town generosity; she bonds with his daughter though his son (Noah Lomax) is still busy grieving the loss of his mom to cancer. Katies budding relationship is dissected and encouraged by her oddly omnipresent neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders of ""How I Met Your Mother"") who offers needlepoint-friendly gems like ""Life is full of second chances"" and advises her to ""take a lot of pictures. Youll only regret the ones you didnt take."" In an era where people regularly Instagram their entrees this comes off a bit outdated but who knows if Southport gets Wi-Fi? Meanwhile a detective (Aussie actor David Lyons) back in Katies hometown is in hot pursuit doggedly combing through security videos and interviewing old neighbors to piece together her current whereabouts. Eventually flashbacks reveal the story Katie an abused wife defended herself against her drunk and violent husband with a kitchen knife then ran (right after another only-in-movies moment the hasty bathroom haircut where you chop off your locks with dull kitchen scissors and dye it with whatevers on hand and it looks amazing). But Katies alarming memories are a mere grain of sand tossed into the soothing warm bath of her life in Southport full of beach trips and lazy afternoon canoe rides and long slow deep soft wet kisses that last -- well not three days per that timeless ""Bull Durham"" edict but long enough. Hough and Duhamel faces aglow with love and just the right amount of spray tan are gorgeous and unchallenging. Alls right with the world. Until inevitably its not; Katie and Alex must face their respective pasts and hers comes racing nightmarishly in on ever so subtly the Fourth of July. Stands will be taken and mettle will be tested against the backdrop of detonating fireworks and flapping American flags. Secrets will be revealed (ones a real howler). And Alexs chivalrous vow will be affirmed ""You dont have to be scared. I love you."" Its a sentiment that should go well with drugstore candy red roses and Hallmark cards. In Sparks country every day is Valentines Day and every emotion can be summed up with one of those chalky candy hearts. The one that most closely approximates my feelings?

"Safe Haven movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Sparks and surprises in Safe Haven  Safe Haven Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel star in ""Safe Haven."" Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel star in ""Safe Haven."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The new Nicholas Sparks movie ""Safe Haven"" takes place in Southport in the novelists adopted home state of North Carolina. Southport is near the mouth of the Cape Fear River. So you know a murderous stalker will eventually arrive in honor of Robert Mitchum in ""Cape Fear.""Its a new wrinkle to have a Sparks plot so dependent on thriller and mystery elements some of them surprise-dependent and therefore off-limits for the purposes of the latest two-star review of the latest adequate Sparks adaptation. Prologue A desperate young woman played by Julianne Hough flees the scene of a crime in Boston under the cloak of night with a fiercely dedicated police detective (David Lyons) on her tail. Assuming a new haircut and a tight-lipped persona Katie gets off the bus at Southport secures a job at the local waterfront diner in 10 minutes flat rents a picturesque cabin in the woods 10 minutes or so later and soon begins trading cautious yet demurely smoldering glances with the local general store proprietor. He is portrayed by Josh Duhamel and his character -- a widower with two children -- is the safe haven of the title.Katie has something to hide; the detective has someone to find; Duhamels Alex has some grieving to put behind him; director Lasse Hallstrom has some sunsets and canoeing montages to shoot in order to pass the time before things grow violent and threatening and then go calm and upbeat again the way they do in Sparks movies. I like Duhamel and in her first straight-up dramatic role Hough does well enough though her singing and/dancing career thus far has trained her to oversell as opposed to sell as opposed to act naturally. As for Jo the mysterious single woman who befriends Katie Shes played by Cobie Smulders and she too has a secret to reveal. You may find yourself way way out ahead of her news as you watch the sunsets and the golden close-ups drift by. Alex and Katies courtship for the record begins with a coffee shop chat on the nutritional merits of kale moves on to a late-night dance at a bait and tackle shop and culminates in discreet lovemaking in the moonlit cabin in the woods.

"Review Safe Haven cant find refuge from a cheesy story - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Safe Haven cant find refuge from a cheesy storyThere is little depth to be found in Safe Haven the latest Nicholas Sparks adaptation and the predictable romance between Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel is painful to watch.February 13 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Noah Lomax left Julianne Hough Mimi Kirkland and Josh Duhamel star in... (James Bridges Relativity...)""Safe Haven"" the latest weepie from a Nicholas Sparks novel takes close to two hours to get where its going a the intersection of Lovers Lane and nowhere. Starring Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel this sloppy sentimental journey is long on beauty shots short on depth and seriously intent on tugging your heartstrings. Indeed it demands you reach for those tissues. Sob.The real cause for tears is that Oscar-nominated director Lasse Hallstrom finds himself in the Nicholas Sparks business these days. ""Safe Haven"" follows 2010s syrupy ""Dear John"" after the filmmaker made a brief detour to make ""The Hypnotist"" his first Swedish film in years (its still awaiting a U.S. release) and the delightful ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen."" In ""Safe Haven"" theres none of the real emotion he tapped in the acclaimed ""Cider House Rules.""Adapted by screenwriter Dana Stevens the films narrative follows the same basic course laid out in all of Sparks work. If you are unfamiliar with the highly emotive road always taken theres a girl theres a guy theres a major life-altering obstacle to their happily ever after. It was war and cancer in ""Dear John"" war and death in ""The Lucky One"" dementia and time in ""The Notebook"" which remains the best. In case youre wondering eight Sparks novels have been adapted thus far; there are another eight on the shelf and the author seems disinclined to end the misery-loves-company cycle.PROFILE Julianne Hough is dancing to a wider Hollywood tuneThe pain in this particular film starts early a in Boston where Katie (Hough) has long brown hair fear in her eyes and blood on her hands. Soon shes clipped and bleached those locks and slipped away from a scary detective named Tierney (David Lyons). A bus drops her in the seaside warmth of Southport N.C. where she rents a rustic cabin in the woods gets a waitressing job at a local fish joint and catches the eye of the towns hunky widower. Alex (Duhamel) is still reeling from his wifes tragic death and being a single-parent to two cute kids a Josh (Noah Lomax) and Lexie (Mimi Kirkland). He happens to own the local grocery store which conveniently has everything Katie needs soup to nuts and paint if shes in the mood to spruce up the cabin.Slowly a oh so slowly a but surely Alex and Katie fall in love. They dont say much a good thing since the dialogue is predictable and mostly irritating. There is a little tension at first a flashbacks in case weve forgotten that Katie is on the run or that Det. Tierney is weirdly obsessed with her case. Still life in the warm summer glow of Southport is pretty much smooth sailing while director of photographer Terry Stacey is given plenty of time to get postcard shots of Katie and Alex at the beach canoeing through the swamp kissing in the cabin.Little by little Katie relaxes and starts to feel gulp safe. She even strikes up a friendship with another young woman. Jo (Cobie Smulders) is the philosophical sort turns up whenever Katie needs to talk and really likes the light a filtering through the trees in the distance.... Just once could they have considered some subtlety?PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesTo his credit Duhamel works hard to make Alex more of the man he should be trying to put some flesh on his character as well as exposing plenty of his own on-screen. Hes particularly sweet with the kids and young Mimi is one to keep your eye on. Hough is another matter. She hasnt figured out how to stop ""acting"" the part. Nothing about Katie feels real and at times the conversational rhythm is so off it is painful to watch.Crisis when it comes lands on the Fourth of July you know fireworks. Its one of the many moments the filmmakers use to underscore that Katie and Alex may be great together but she really cares about the kids. She would probably make a really terrific mother despite the knife and the bloody hands and the wanted posters that are now plastered across the nation. Shes really a sweetheart.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 227 p.m. EST February 14 2013With a mystery at its core this film deviates somewhat from the usual progression in Nicholas Sparks movies but hits many familiar notes. Mostly its dogged by bad performances.Josh Duhamel and Julianne Hough star in the latest Nicholas Sparks adaptation the sappy and predictable Safe Haven.(Photo James Bridges Relativity Media)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Julianna Hough Josh Duhamel David Lyons Mimi Kirkland Noah LomaxRated PG-13; runtime 1 hour 55 minutes; opens Thursday nationwideSafe Haven may not be the most dangerous place to spend Valentines Day -- but its hardly a worthwhile romantic choice.This emotionally manipulative tale ( out of four rated PG-13; opening Thursday nationwide) centers on Katie (Julianna Hough) a mysterious woman who abruptly leaves her Boston home and ends up in a quiet seaside village in North Carolina. We learn mostly through flashbacks that something traumatic happened to her prompting her to get on a bus and flee. Constantly looking over her shoulder she avoids human connection.But she cant quite resist the charms of handsome store owner Alex (Josh Duhamel) a widower with two adorable children. STORY Duhamel Hough test limits of romance in Safe HavenFIVE QUESTIONS Julianne Hough and Josh DuhamelVIDEO Duhamel premieres Safe Haven with FergieIt seems to take forever but she ultimately falls for Alex and makes a powerful connection with his children. Still she cant outrun her past.Duhamel has a charming affability and a self-deprecating sense of humor first visible in 2004s Win a Date With Tad Hamilton. But hes not given much opportunity here. Dogged by substandard dialogue and lack of chemistry with Hough he comes off as sweetly earnest eye candy.The film hinges on Katie and Houghs performance is a weak link. She is meant to be harboring a dark secret but no one could seem less tortured. A professional dancer her acting credits include roles in Footloose Burlesque and Rock of Ages but Hough doesnt have the requisite dramatic skills to make her character believable or worth caring about. She goes around with a blank expression then suddenly lets loose with an orthodontists dream of a smile as if she just remembered to have a personality. But beaming adorably does not a personality make.Almost as bad is David Lyons who plays Kevin a driven policeman who grows more maniacal as the film unspools. Hes a villain with a capital V and goes around drinking and driving and dishonoring a small-town Fourth of July parade. If he had a mustache hed surely twirl it.The two actors with the most vitality and genuine appeal are young Mimi Kirkland and Noah Lomax who play Alexs children Lexi and Josh..A pair of laughably ludicrous plot twists loom. But dont be fooled This film adapted from the novel by Nicholas Sparks is no thriller. Its focus remains squarely on sappy romance. Its set as nearly all Sparks tales are in a picturesque Southern town marked by good-hearted folks lovely homes and a gorgeous coastline. The love scenes are gauzily romantic and staunchly PG. Dialogue is heavy on sentimentality. The story hits many familiar notes -- a handsome widower who hasnt quite gotten over his wifes death a need to start over fresh in a quaintly beautiful setting.This is director Lasse Hallstroms second Sparks adaptation (after Dear John in 2010) and its hard to imagine why someone who made such wonderful films as My Life as a Dog and Whats Eating Gilbert Grape would bother with this formulaic schmaltzy fare. Perhaps he just wanted to work in a gorgeous locale? The picture-postcard location of Southport N.C. is the films strong suit.Alexs description of the scenic town also applies to the movie ""Nothing very exciting happens here but it sure is beautiful.""Safe Haven clip Empty CanvasSkip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Alex (Josh Duhamel) quizzes Katie (Julianne Hough) on why she came to Southport and how long she is staying. 96 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/Ud867B",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/02/13/safe-haven-review/1915577/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader,200,safehaven23,safehaven,usatoday

BY Miriam Bale NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday February 14 2013 600 AM Title Safe Haven Film Info PG-13. Area theaters. A woman and a widower are drawn together in a sleepy North Carolina town. Director Lasse Hallstrom (156). PG-13. Area theaters. Well timed for Valentines Day this film based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks (""The Notebook"" ""The Lucky One"" ""Dear John"") is another take on fateful love amid rustic settings in a Southern coastal burg. Yet ""Safe Haven"" begins as off-kilter suspense shot with jagged rough cuts and some mystery thrown in. But dont despair. Boat rides hand-written letters and declarations of love are on the horizon. Julianne Hough plays Katie a mysterious -- but spunky -- woman who picks a small town in North Carolina at random to begin her life anew. She rents a rustic cabin deep in the woods to hide from the world meeting the endearing grade-schooler Lexie (Mimi Kirkland) at the towns general store. Lexies dad Alex (Josh Duhamel whose admirable torso should get a co-starring credit) also notices Katie pursuing her arduously yet clumsily. Katie however after experiencing or perhaps causing some heinous crime in the past is a tough nut to crack. The suspense -- rare in a Sparks story -- actually enhances the loss-of-boundaries fear some have when beginning a relationship while heightening the dramatic stakes. Duhamel is goofy and harmless but unlike Ryan Gosling in ""Notebook"" adds no texture or subtlety. Hough (""Footloose"") while photogenic is similarly bland. Director Lasse Hallstrom (""Chocolat"") films the mystery in a disjointed and harrowing way. The problem is that most of the pieces to the shoddy puzzle ultimately dont fit making things less believable and successful. Theres too much of a detour from the romance which is the safe part of the story -- and what most of the audience will cling to. On mobile?

Photo Credit Relativity Media advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A young woman with a mysterious past finds a new life and love in a small town. Rated PG-13 (mild sexuality and violence) BOTTOM LINE A pleasant enough romance helped along by mild suspense but this Nicholas Sparks adaptation also includes a serving of schmaltz big enough to choke on. Youve been warned. CAST Julianne Hough Josh Duhamel David Lyons Cobie Smulders LENGTH 155 Nicholas Sparks the best-selling novelist now on his eighth film adaptation knows what works and hes sticking with it. Since 1999s ""Message in a Bottle"" starring Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn hes been providing the foundations for classy tasteful romantic dramas with attractive stars and top-shelf directors. Generally speaking the settings are bucolic the heroines damaged the men bereft the letters written on creamy stationery. And somewhere in there youre sure to find a vague spirituality thick and gooey as a store-bought pie. Not much has changed in Sparks latest ""Safe Haven"" which he also coproduced. Julianne Hough (""Rock of Ages"") plays Katie a new arrival to the little fishing village of Southport N.C. whos looking for privacy but instead finds Alex (Josh Duhamel ""Life as We Know It""). His wife recently died of cancer leaving him to raise little Lexi (gaptoothed Mimi Kirkland) and Josh (Noah Lomax ""Playing for Keeps""). Back in Boston though a single-minded cop is looking for Katie -- turns out she left behind a knife covered in someones blood. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Thats something of a departure for Sparks but the tension and sense of danger help push along this low-wattage romance. Hough and Duhamel are both pleasant to look at -- shes appealingly zaftig hes unthreateningly hunky -- and director Lasse Hallstrom (""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"") treats them tenderly focusing more on hand-holding than lovemaking. The guy who really spikes the movies pulse is that cop played with tingly menace by a very good David Lyons. ""Safe Haven"" is passably engaging and almost works as a proper thriller. Then -- wham Sparks throws that schmaltz pie right in your kisser. Hes sticking with it all right. PLOT A young woman with a mysterious past finds a new life and love in a small town.

A young woman on the run from a violent past looks to get a fresh start in ""Safe Haven"" although dramatically speaking theres nothing particularly fresh about her decision to fall for an attractive widower with two cute kids against some picturesque oceanfront scenery. Familiarity of course is an expectation and a virtue for fans of the genial romantic hokum popularized by novelist Nicholas Sparks and insofar as this Lasse Hallstrom-directed adaptation proves rather livelier and less drippy than last years ""The Lucky One"" distaff audiences should respond favorably enough. Fleeing the scene of a crime that will only come into focus later desperate Katie Feldman (Julianne Hough) boards a bus and gets off in Southport a small town on the North Carolina coast. Hoping to settle down and live in quiet isolation she gets a job as a waitress rents a ramshackle woodland cabin and tentatively bonds with a friendly neighbor (Cobie Smulders) though not before locking eyes with Alex (Josh Duhamel) the handsome proprietor of the local general store. Still mourning the loss of his wife and doing his best to raise his sensitive sullen son (Noah Lomax) and bright button-cute daughter (Mimi Kirkland) Alex is clearly the healing Katie needs and vice versa. Their romance develops with a slow pleasing predictability -- a random act of kindness here an impromptu beach trip there -- ushered along by the instrumental caresses of Deborah Luries score and the eye-catching vistas of Terry Staceys widescreen photography. This is Hallstroms second Sparks adaptation after 2010s ""Dear John"" (though hes been busy in the interim with ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" and ""The Hypnotist"") and his gentle impersonal touch makes him an ideal interpreter of this brand of soothingly banal mass-market fiction. ""Safe Haven"" boasts more of a suspense-thriller orientation than the authors prior work something Hallstrom accentuates here by repeatedly cutting away to a creepy cop (David Lyons) who seems just a bit too determined to track Katie down. The effect of watching the film is thus not unlike snuggling up with a warm blanket that keeps getting ripped away just before tiredness sets in. Or perhaps its the proverbial rug getting pulled out from under the viewer; the script by Dana Stevens (""Life or Something Like It"" ""City of Angels"") turns out to have a few semi-surprises in store allowing Hallstrom to raise a few third-act goosebumps en route to a fiery overwrought climax. In all other respects ""Safe Haven"" offers an unsurprising but not unsatisfying tour through recognizable Sparkville terrain. Rest assured the leads will get caught in a rainstorm all the better to ease them out of their soaking garments. Katie presumably trying to keep a low profile will for some reason opt for the most conspicuous blonde dye job possible. Childrens lives will be threatened at narratively opportune moments. Horrible traumas will be revealed as the workings of a grand cosmic design pushing the story to the sort of maudlin extremes that typically separate the weepers from the gigglers in the audience. Rather less taxing than her musical showcases ""Rock of Ages"" and ""Footloose"" this isnt the picture that will enable Hough to establish herself as more than a pretty face though she plays vulnerable well enough and achieves a modestly affecting rapport with Duhamels sensitive hunk. Special mention must be made of Kirkland an 8-year-old natural who turns the simple act of bagging groceries into perhaps the movies most authentic instance of human behavior.

His books are best-sellers and several of the films adapted from his novels -- Message in a Bottle Dear John and especially The Notebook -- have generated impressive box-office grosses. The latest Sparks adaptation Safe Haven probably will continue his winning streak especially with its Valentines Day opening pegged to lure female fans. A thriller element that has not been present in earlier Sparks movies is designed to draw reluctant male viewers to see the picture but they wont respond with the same enthusiasm as his core audience of woozy romantics. PHOTOS The Nicholas Sparks Playbook His 7 Favorite Plot Tricks The mystery plot recalls a 1991 Julia Roberts movie Sleeping With the Enemy in which the heroine fled an abusive husband and tried to reinvent herself in a brand-new community. In this case our heroine Katie (Julianne Hough) runs away from a toxic marriage in Boston boards a bus and on a whim gets off in a small seaside community in North Carolina. There she meets a sensitive widower Alex (Josh Duhamel) raising two young children on his own. Because of their troubled histories they approach each other warily but theres little doubt about where their relationship is headed. Before long however a nasty blast from Katies past arrives to threaten her newfound bliss. The first problem with the film is that the burgeoning romance is too flat to generate intense audience empathy. Alexs daughter who barely remembers her mother warms to Katie immediately but her older brother has a harder time with his fathers new relationship. Still this complication isnt especially well developed in the screenplay by Dana Stevens and Gage Lansky. In addition the two main characters are such paragons that there are no real psychological impediments to their union. To jack up the tension director Lasse Hallstrom (who also helmed Dear John) keeps intercutting scenes of a grim hard-drinking Boston cop (David Lyons) determined to track Katie down. But the gauzy romantic interludes prove to be something of a yawn. When her nemesis finally arrives in North Carolina the film does develop some effectively suspenseful moments. But the drama is a long time coming. VIDEO Nicholas Sparks on Safe Havens Box-Office Prospects Itll Do Fine. They All Do A related problem is the casting. The best Sparks movie The Notebook had the strongest cast with talented newcomers Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams balancing seasoned veterans James Garner and Gena Rowlands. To put it as charitably as possible the actors in Safe Haven are not in the same league. Hough better known as a singer and dancer than a dramatic actress is likably spunky but Duhamel fades into the background and there are no lively supporting players in the ensemble. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is that Hallstrom who burst into prominence with his fine direction of child actors in the 1985 Swedish film My Life as a Dog fails to draw vivid performances from the two actors cast as Alexs children. Hallstroms direction is generally lackluster. The picture is certainly competent but a dozen other journeyman directors could have executed this piece just as efficiently. Its hard to see much evidence of the talent that brightened his My Life as a Dog The Cider House Rules or even Chocolat. The seaside locations are tenderly evoked by cinematographer Terry Stacey and production designer Kara Lindstrom but the film isnt visually memorable or dramatically vibrant. It does however have one sentimental surprise at the end that testifies to Sparks storytelling shrewdness. This last-minute twist is shameless and stupefying but it demonstrates why Sparks has an army of fervent readers. His fans no doubt will swoon over this tear-jerking finale even while critics stare at the screen with jaws open in disbelief.

David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The Nicholas Sparks universe finally gets the crime thriller it deserves an erratic amalgam of mush and mystery with an 11th-hour dose of supernatural visitation. Watching ""Safe Haven"" you feel a strange disconnect between what is happening with the characters and what is happening in the plot. In the foreground is a love story between a pair of agreeable stock characters. Theres Katie (Julianne Hough) a Bostonian newly arrived in sleepy photogenic Southport N.C. and Alex (Josh Duhamel) the handsome widowed proprietor of the quaint oceanside grocery. Behind them clanking and grinding and popping rivets is the story apparatus a devilish meat grinder combining domestic violence interstate flight from pursuing police and restless spirits. Whats your point exactly Nick? You can understand the impulse to make ""Safe Haven"" stand apart from Sparks growing catalog of bland interchangeable romance movies but the result is figurative and literal overkill. By piling complications atop surprise revelations this scatterbrained film gets in its own way. The film starts in a rush as Katie flees what appears to be a crime scene slipping past the authorities by wearing a hoodie and feigning pregnancy. That may be a character note actually. Hopping off the bus in scenic Southport shes magnetically attracted to single dad Alex and his appealing kids. Hes a sitcom-style lovable doofus with good fixer-upper potential. As a woman on the lam however Katie cant reveal her feelings despite the urging of Jo (Cobie Smulders) a neighbor who encourages her to lighten up and settle down. The film is competently directed by Lasse Hallstrom but the back-and-forth design of the romantic mystery defeats him. Were supposed to wonder whether Katie is a fugitive murderess but were not fooled. The misdirection is all too obvious. The scene-of-the-crime vignettes are montages that are clearly omitting relevant information. Besides Sparks heroines are paragons. When the real villain is revealed that character is extra despicable with sprinkles on top defiling a July 4th parade just so theres no confusion. The film concludes with a forehead-slapping twist that throws the last vestige of logic out the window. Movies dont have to make a lick of sense to be great entertainment as long as theyre fleet-footed enough to keep us diverted. ""Safe Haven"" bogs down in every new twist. Its a 10-round cage match between form and content fought to a punishing pointless draw.

(AP Photo/Relativity Media James Bridges) When a movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks novel we dont expect surprises. We expect the spunky young divorcee/runaway/widow and the hunky young fisherman/songwriter/lifeguard to realize that theyre soul mates by the time they save the old lighthouse/chapel/zoo from a devastating hurricane/fire/foreclosure.""Safe Haven"" is a departure from the Sparks itinerary with violence nipping at the heels of the beautiful newcomer and a supernatural plot twist in the last act and even veteran helmer Lasse Hallstrom cant steer this leaky vessel to a satisfying finish.Its an uncomfortable jolt for a romance movie to start with a terrified waif (Julianne Hough) fleeing the bloody scene of an apparent murder. In desperate pursuit is Boston detective Tierney (David Lyons) and he searches the entire country for the accused killer as she randomly disembarks from a bus to start a new life. The Carolina coastal town of Southport is a typical Sparks setting with a seafood restaurant that needs a new waitress a rental shack that needs a fresh coat of paint and a widower who needs a female influence for his two young kids.Easygoing Alex (Josh Duhamel) runs the general store and bait shop and although friendly neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders) describes him as a great catch reclusive Katie cant be bothered. But the sea breezes a bayou canoe trip and Alexs precocious daughter (Mimi Kirkland) work their magic and Katie falls for Alex -- at the exact moment when the hard-drinking rogue cop arrives in town for the Fourth of July parade. If youve seen the Julia Roberts thriller ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" you can add another checkmark to the list of familiar ingredients in this potboiler. Hallstrom (""Chocolat"") makes the mishmash palatable and romance mainstay Duhamel provides some sweet-and-salty charm but theres not much they can do with Sparks canned dialogue and Houghs undercooked acting.

James Bridges/Relativity Media SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Safe Haven Bad 2 stars Director Lasse Hallstrom.Cast Julianne Hough Josh Duhamel Cobie Smulders.Rating PG-13 for thematic material involving threatening behavior and for violence and sexuality. By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Fri Feb 22 2013 1100 AM The latest in a long dull line of Nicholas Sparks book-to-film adaptations ""Safe Haven"" plays out less like a love story than it does a two-hour audition tape Julianne Hough commissioned to land a lucrative lip-gloss-modeling contract. She smacks and bites those slick pink lips playing Katie a 20-something seemingly on the lam as she hops a bus just in time to evade the cop on her tail. The bus takes her all the way to Southport N.C. where silent Katie prettily contemplates the water to the mournful pluckings of an acoustic guitar. Still flawless after fleeing the law on a cross-country bus trip and then sleeping on the beach Katie immediately lands a job as a server at Ivans Fish Shack a gig that apparently pays well enough for her to buy a charming fixer-upper in the woods after a couple of paychecks so she can begin in earnest her new life of rugged isolation. The kink in her plan is Alex (Josh Duhamel) the conveniently widowed beefcake with two adorable children -- a ready-made family if Katie would only open herself up to loves possibilities. Which this being a Sparks adaptation is bound to happen. But first there must be days worth of chaste courting -- bike riding twirling on a tree swing contemplative canoeing and eating baby carrots on the beach long stretches of idyllic nothing that are less dreamy than they are boring. And man is it ever boring. It gets so that you forget to wonder why Katie even is there in the first place at least until the rogue cop picks up her scent again in a dimwitted police-procedural subplot that would look more at home on the Hallmark Movie Channel. You know hes the bad guy from the way he broods and swills from a vodka bottle as hes driving. Katie meanwhile grows closer to hunky Alex in spite of herself. She searches her heart on long walks through the woods with her friend Jo (Cobie Smulders) another inexplicably single-loner lady living on the fringe who dispenses bromides like throat lozenges. ""Life is full of second chances"" she sagely intones. ""Would you look at that sunshine? Its incandescent today."" Are there really second chances? Can life begin anew? The film barely asks those questions then lazily answers them in exactly as everyone expects. As slick and calculated a product as most Sparks adaptations (""The Lucky One"" ""Dear John"") ""Safe Haven"" is every bit as predictable as its predecessors. Nobody expects it to soar to great heights but with Hough as the albatross around its pretty little neck it never even gets off the ground.

"Safe Haven | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; safe-haven ) Safe Haven (United States 2013) February 13 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its pointless criticizing a Nicholas Sparks movie for being a Nicholas Sparks movie. Sparks like Barbara Cartland before him delivers exactly what his fans want romance between two attractive people. He tugs at heartstrings acts like an onion on tear ducts and provide the dose of sappy fantasy that allows his readers to escape into a world thats about as real as Middle Earth. This kind of thing inevitably works better in writing than in movies. Reading a Sparks novel allows ones imagination to enter the equation. Watching one of his stories adapted on screen has exactly the opposite effect it neuters the imagination. This is soap opera pure and simple. Its trash - entertaining and escapist perhaps - but trash nonetheless. Overcoming the contrived plot points and painfully obvious ""twists"" makes it a difficult task to concentrate on the basic critical character interaction. In Safe Haven Sparks gives us two familiar romantic types. Theres the incredibly attractive spunky girl with a tragic mysterious past. Then theres the incredibly attractive sensitive guy with a tragic (but not so mysterious) past. The movie takes a little while to get Alex (Josh Duhamel) and Katie (Julianne Hough) together but such foreplay is necessary in a movie like this. Eventually they inch closer to one another develop feelings and engage in some PG-13 sex. Things seem to be going smoothly until a dark figure from Katies past (David Lyons) shows up waving a gun being mean to everyone (even a little girl) drinking vodka out of a water bottle and making it pretty obvious that hes not just a nice guy who has been misunderstood. I will admit to being surprised by one thing in the movie because its so far beyond the genres DNA. That is to say it would easy enough to accept in a different sort of movie but is more than a little offputting in a Nicholas Sparks romance. Outside of that the movie goes to great pains to remind us of its pedigree. There are postcard worthy shots of landscapes bathed in golden sunlight romantic scenes that take place in the pouring rain and a cloying application of the phrase ""love conquers all."" The acting is fine for the movie. Josh Duhamel steps away from his Transformers persona to do a decent job as a leading man in a romance. Hes charming and charismatic and interacts well with his co-star Julianne Hough. My reaction to her is much the same as it has been in her other roles the camera loves her but she doesnt necessarily love it back. Her acting skills could use a littlea| refinement. Then again this is a Nicholas Sparks movie so thespian talent plays a distant second to physical appearance. Duhamel and Hough make an appealing couple and thats all that really matters. David Lyons hams it up as the bad guy to the point where his performance is laughable. The only things missing are the black hat and long pencil-thin mustache. Once upon a time director Lasse Hallstrom made substantive emotionally forceful movies. Lately however he seems to have lost his way. Although I liked his recent Salmon Fishing in the Yemen it was sandwiched in-between two Sparks movies. Apparently he has now become the go-to guy for the author. Hallstrom is good at putting sentiment on-screen but theres a fine line between something that touches the heart and something that triggers the gag reflex. The filmmaker once understood where that demarcation was but Im no longer sure thats the case. Hey Im not the target audience for this any more than I have been for the many other Sparks novel-turned-movies. From time-to-time I have enjoyed them in much the way that one enjoys a tawdry paperback read on the beach during the summer. Mostly though I find them forgettable predictable and a little annoying. I like romances but prefer for them to be smart and fresh - two qualities that dont apply to Safe Haven. The film isnt awful but its tiresome in its relentless lack of originality. Sadly thats precisely the quality that will draw 90% of its audience into theaters.

Its the most interesting part of the movie and gives us hope that this one could break from the Sparks formula by injecting some drama into the by-the-numbers romance to come.No such luck.Now a blond Katie ends up in the quiet seaside town of Southport N.C. where she hopes to hide out -- from what or who were not sure but we can guess -- amid the sailboats and Spanish moss.Alex (Fergies mate Josh Duhamel of Transformers Dark of the Moon) the single dad hottie who runs the local grocery mart with the help of his adorable kids Lexi (Mimi Kirkland) and Josh (Noah Lomax) soon gives her the glad eye. But he gets the brush.Katie is only interested in getting a job slinging fish burgers at a waterside cafe and hiding from the law especially one detective in particular who seems obsessed with bringing her to justice (David Lyons). Thanks to the chucklehead cops of Southport its not a challenge for Katie to stay under the radar although shes always looking over her adorable shoulder.While Katie paints the floor in her newly rented secluded cabin and changes into a series of cuter-than-cute short shorts and tees she reluctantly befriends pushy neighbour Jo (Vancouvers How I Met Your MotherCobie Smulders of How I Met Your Mother) who schools her in the ways of Southern folks. Katie confesses to Alex she was a victim of spousal abuse making it sound like she was the dumb bunny who made wrong choices and he does the Sparks hero trademark move folding her into his arms and promising unending devotion and protection. A day at the beach with Alex and the kids cements their bond. Kitchen-table philosophies -- like ""the only pictures you regret are the ones you didnt take"" -- are liberally scattered. Katie pushes her hair out of her eyes and Alex makes lunch. Then he cups her face tilted up in new-found bliss as the only thing that could come between them a ray of sunshine illuminates their kiss. This trademark moment happens in every single one of these movies -- along with the joyous jump into the guys arms while wrapping her legs around his slim hips -- this being the eighth adapted from 17 Sparks romance novels.Unfortunately theres not enough heat between these two to warm a shivering hamster. Director Lasse Hallstrom (Chocolat) re-ups with the franchise (he helmed 2010 Sparks soaper Dear John) and makes the most of the seaside setting and all-American July 4 colours that culminate in the worlds longest fireworks display. Theres also a surprise twist that I guarantee nobody will see coming (this should not be interpreted as praise).With Safe Haven still on the ""reprint fiction"" bestseller lists and a Valentines Day movie release date theres no doubt the filmmakers hope to generate some seasonal box office with this forgettable romance.On the plus side Hough a professional hoofer Dancing with the Stars champ and beloved of Ryan Seacrest shows there are some acting skills lurking somewhere inside the treacle. The best Valentine she could get would be a decent script perhaps an indie project that relies on her talent more than her pert button-nosed good looks.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.
