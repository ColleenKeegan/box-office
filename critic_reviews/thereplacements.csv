Starring Keanu Reeves Gene Hackman and Brooke Langton. Directed by Howard Deutch. (PG-13. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Replacements"" is just like a low-budget football comedy only with money. So instead of starring say Scott Bakula as the quarterback it stars Keanu Reeves. And instead of having say Rob Schneider in the broadcast booth it has real-life broadcasters Pat Summerall and John Madden . In every other aspect ""The Replacements"" is run-of-the-mill formulaic stuff. Its not ""North Dallas Forty"" or even ""The Longest Yard."" Its more like the forgettable ""Necessary Roughness"" -- or the gridiron equivalent of ""Major League III."" Likable enough impossible to love. The picture which opens today is about a group of replacement players who are recruited by an NFL coach (Gene Hackman) to finish out the season during a players strike. ""The Replacements"" is intended to be the inspiring tale of a ragtag group of common men who come together to achieve greatness blah blah blah . . . Unfortunately the teammates are weak and clumsily drawn. Remember Hugh Grants disgusting roommate in ""Notting Hill"" the English guy who did nothing but smoke and scratch himself? Here that same actor Rhys Ifans is playing essentially the same person the teams kicker a disgusting Welsh guy who does nothing but smoke and scratch himself. Jon Favreau (""Swingers"") a likable comic actor plays a linebacker and he is presented as nothing but a mad dog growling and baring his teeth. His routine is almost funny for almost a minute. The other teammates are drawn just as broadly and according to type the gun-packing gangstas the surly prisoner on parole and the sumo wrestler (who eats a lot). Since its impossible to care about the players its difficult to care about how they perform on the field especially during the long and dull football sequences in the movies first half. The team doesnt even have underdog status to recommend it The whole league is on strike so every team is made of replacements. One set of replacements is as good as another. Fortunately ""The Replacements"" has Hackman and Reeves and they make the film watchable. Together they provide a winning father-son undertone. As the coach Hackman is at his most twinkly and wise while Reeves takes the series of cliches hes supposed to play and fleshes them out with his own gentle amiability and peculiar gravity. He plays Shane Falco a fellow who should have had a career as a pro quarterback -- especially with that name -- but he choked in the Sugar Bowl and his team lost by 45 points. At the start of the film he has a new career scraping plankton off boats. Thats the funniest thing about Vince McKewins screenplay though its not intended to be Plankton-scraping Shane has to think long and hard before he accepts the offer to return to football. Reeves makes this fellows journey believable. He knows how to play self-doubt humility and fear and this character is all about those things. For five years Shane has lived with disappointment and the sense of being a failure. He is terrified of having that wound reopened and that self-assessment confirmed for all time. ""The Replacements"" never works as the story of a team. When it tries it becomes obvious manipulative and phony. Thats no small criticism. The film is also too long -- a lot of the first half could be cut. Yet as the picture wears on and Shanes personal story increasingly becomes the focus ""The Replacements"" almost redeems itself. Brooke Langton as the head cheerleader a tomboyish type not often seen in movies makes a welcome romantic partner for Reeves. Its a good indication that a sports movie is working when the audience starts holding its breath on the crucial plays. It doesnt happen until the last third of ""The Replacements"" but it happens. ..

C- The Replacements Genre Sports Comedy; Starring Gene Hackman Keanu Reeves Jon Favreau Rhys Ifans Orlando Jones Brooke Langton; Director Howard Deutch; Producer (group) Bel Air Entertainment Warner Bros.; Release Date Wide 08/11/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 114; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted August 18 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT Lovable housebroken underdogs working together to score the crucial basket/touchdown/home run/goal against impossible odds Its one of the winningest plots in Hollywood. But fashioning team spirit out of strikebreaking The Replacements has got to be the first studio movie (made by well-paid union members some of them millionaires) about a bunch of guys who snake jobs usually held by highly skilled highly paid union members. This is a feel-good movie about scabs. That our current flush political and economic climate favors such an antilabor story line so uncontroversially is the big news in this bottom-of-the-bin entertainment from Hollywoods summer freezer of perishables. (Apparently union busting in sports is okay because fans and owners not to mention SAG cast and IATSE crew are unsympathetic to the plight of striking sports millionaires.) The only other comparable headline is that Keanu Reeves plays a former footballer. With a great flourish of movie history hes called Shane Falco and he scrapes a living scraping barnacles off boats when hes recruited as quarterback for the ""crew of outsiders"" (as the publicity material calls them) assembled by coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) to finish out the season for the fictional Washington Sentinels. The movie written by Vince McKewin and directed by Howard Deutch with little of the fizz he brought to Pretty in Pink is inspired by the NFL players strike of 1987. The incisive close-up photography by The Sixth Senses Tak Fujimoto outclasses the story by yards. Im charmed that Reeves with his alt-rocker physique and Zen-adepts impassive face chose to follow up his cult-hit success as someone whos all brain in The Matrix by clamping a helmet over his soft floppy Pantene-shiny hair and rushing the field as someone whos supposed to be all body. The casting is weird and counterintuitive bordering on preposterous but I dont mind; it may suggest a perception glitch on the stars part to think this is a role hes in fact suited for but I prefer to think of him as...unfazed. As played by Reeves Falco may be the games most passive offensive player but hes cute in his big shoulder pads and little butt-hugging pants. When the quarterback smiles at the teams head cheerleader (Swingers Brooke Langton) shes a goner another girl reeled in by sexual inertia rather than athletic prowess. And when Reeves is paired in scenes with Hackman the younger actor looks particularly delicate as Hackman bares his choppers barking out cliched messages of tough love about ""the man you are and the man you ought to be."" But then Reeves looks breakable on the field and off -- and never more so than when consorting with his fellow ""working class"" teammates a monochromatic study in diversity. Jon Favreau another distinguished Swingers alumnus broadly plays an L.A. cop who lunges snarls and tackles like a human pit bull; Mad TVs Orlando Jones fast-talks as an incompetent street punk with a talent for sprinting; Rhys Ifans Hugh Grants wacky Welsh roommate in Notting Hill plays a chain-smoking kicker imported from the unruly English soccer fields -- a noodle of a lad next to whom Reeves looks positively strapping. Theres also a Japanese sumo wrestler (Ace Yonamine) and a deaf athlete (David Denman) whose first shot at glory ironically rewards deafness in the face of picket-line chanting -- replacement workers all just doing their jobs while the uniformly obnoxious striking players picket at best and overturn Falcos unprepossessing pickup truck at their violent worst. (In retaliation one of the ""outsiders"" blasts the windows of a strikers showily expensive Porsche.) The cues about privilege and resentment money and class are loud but vague Are replacement workers the only ones who play for love of the game? Will the meek inherit the playing fields? ""Pain heals. Chicks dig scars. Glory lasts forever"" Falco tells his teammates like a little Buddha. At least one ungarbled moment of communication emerges in this labor dispute. After a melee the pickup team lands briefly in jail each man in private despair. Then one guy starts singing Gloria Gaynors disco anthem ""I Will Survive"" probably because he thinks thats the only song allowed in movies these days. Pretty soon hes dancing a smooth line-dance sashay and other men join and then the Welsh nutter learns the moves and finally even Keanu Reeves feels the beat and he awkwardly twirls and slides. Its a hackneyed scene but one of the few in The Replacements that replaces convoluted intentions with silly entertainment. Had the picketing football players been invited to join the hoedown the strike might have ended on the spot.

Even so pic scores as a late-summer crowd-pleaser with strong sleeper potential. Though probably not a contender for Hall of Fame status the film figures to post strong numbers on the theatrical scoreboard and generate even more impressive action on the homevid playing field. In ""The Replacements"" most of the smooth moves come from a well-thumbed playbook and no key player bothers to go outside the lines while tackling his stereotypical role. Even so pic scores as a late-summer crowd-pleaser with strong sleeper potential. Though probably not a contender for Hall of Fame status the film figures to post strong numbers on the theatrical scoreboard and generate even more impressive action on the homevid playing field. Smartly positioned to break wide in North America during the NFL preseason pic is a frankly formulaic but agreeably funny comedy about has-beens wannabes and never-weres recruited by team owners during a strike by pro footballers. Vince McKewins by-the-numbers script obviously is based on the true-life misadventures of replacement players employed during the 1987 NFL strike. That no one in ""Replacements"" ever mentions the real-world precedent only adds to the air of unreality that permeates this feel-good fantasy. (Try to imagine say a movie about a space-shuttle disaster in which no one ever mentions the ill-fated Challenger mission.) But updating the fact-based story to contemporary times was a shrewd decision Controversies about overpaid and under-appreciative players in all pro sports are even hotter topics now than they were a decade ago. Very early in the game the makers of ""Replacements"" make it clear where their sympathies lie. The striking players in general and snide quarterback Eddie Martel (Brett Cullen) in particular are unflatteringly tarred with the same brush They are ""a bunch of bitchy millionaires"" (according to team owner Edward ONeil played by Jack Warden) who have lost their love and passion for the sport. On the other hand the game not the fame is still the most important thing for replacement players such as Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves) a once-promising college quarterback whose spirit was broken by a devastating Sugar Bowl loss. When veteran coach Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) is plucked from retirement to assemble and coach a replacement team for the Washington Sentinels the currently underemployed Falco is at the top of a very short list of potential recruits. And how does McGinty know who Falco is and where he might contact him? Well you see even though hes been out of the game for a long time -- since the 80s someone mentions in passing -McGinty has continued to keep track of promising or overlooked players throughout the U.S. just in case he might ever have to field a football team with less than a weeks notice. Hey look this is the sort of the thing you simply have to accept in this kind of movie. You also have to accept that the other pick-up players on the ersatz Sentinels lineup will be a sitcom-flavored demographics-conscious mix of aggressively colorful oddballs eccentrics and hair-trigger brutes. Jon Favreau (""Swingers"") feasts on the scenery and even munches on a few co-stars as a psychotic SWAT cop turned linebacker while Rhys Ifans (the scene-stealing roommate in ""Notting Hill"") adds the right touch of bantamweight swagger as a chain-smoking Welsh footballer who emerges as a world-class kicker. Other teammates include Michael Jace as a glowering convict on temporary leave from state prison; Michael ""Bear"" Taliferro and Faizon Love as large-and-in-charge bodyguards who move from the music industry to the playing field; Orlando Jones as a blazingly fast sprinter whos all thumbs when it comes to actually catching the ball; Troy Winbush as a born-again Christian whos willing to smite the wicked on any given Sunday; David Denman as a deaf tight end who knows all the right moves when someone signs the play for him; and Ace Yonamine as a sumo wrestler with an unfortunate propensity for eating too much before big games. On the sidelines chief cheerleader Annabelle Farrell (Brooke Langton) tries to assemble a new squad of limber lovelies -- evidently the regular cheerleaders went out on strike too -- and winds up settling for a crew of hot-to-trot lap dancers. Naturally Annabelle insists that she doesnt mix business with pleasure and initially refuses to date Shane. Just as naturally her resistance melts long before the inevitable scene in which she gives the quarterback an extra word of encouragement before the most important game of his life. ""The Replacements"" is not a pic that requires an audience to remain intensely attentive to each warp and woof of its plot. Indeed everything is so predictable and each character is so stereotypical that you can make frequent visits to the snack bar without missing anything that qualifies as a shocking revelation or an unexpected plot twist. But if you stick around for every minute of the movie youll likely gain additional respect for Hackmans ability to infuse a paper-thin role with gravitas and authority. Youll also better appreciate Reeves engagingly down-to-earth performance as a regular guy whos both thrilled and terrified to be given an extraordinary break. Langton (like Favreau a ""Swingers"" veteran) effortlessly conveys an appealing naturalness that should mark her for bigger and better things. Among the Sentinels Ifans and Jones acquit themselves as the most valuable supporting players. Although nearly two hours long ""The Replacements"" takes a brisk trot over familiar territory and never seems padded or unduly protracted. Director Howard Deutch (""Pretty in Pink"") actually may have erred on the side of brevity -- a few implied subplots including Annabelles possible prior relationship with quarterback Eddie Martel appear to have been radically downsized in the editing room. Deutch manages to make even the hoariest of cliches acceptable if not entirely credible by moving full speed ahead preventing the audience from pausing for too many second thoughts. Second unit director Allan Graf strikes the right balance of broad humor and virile ferocity while staging the football sequences. Pop tunes have been chosen with unusual care and understated wit for the soundtrack -- note the clever use of ""Every Move You Make"" and ""Heroes."" Other tech credits are solid. One minor cavil The depiction of strikers as spoiled greedheads and replacement players as blue-collar heroes should please many audiences and likely will generate lively discussions on sports-talk radio shows that will provide invaluable free publicity for the pic. And Hackman is undeniably affecting when he stirs emotions by telling his passed-over players ""Youve been given what no athlete ever gets -- a second chance."" But dont be surprised if some critics -- and maybe a few pro football stars -- note the irony of a Hollywood movie paying tribute to strike-breaking scabs at a time when actors are striking against commercial producers and strongly considering a work stoppage next year aimed at film and TV moguls. Obviously your perception of whos a hero and whos a rat depends on what side of the picket line youre on.

But its real antecedent is not football history but the history of cinema Its a rehash of every film from ""The Seven Samurai"" to ""The Mighty Ducks"" that tells the story of a band of misfits who overcome adversity infighting and incompetence to a) whip the bad guys b) buck the system c) surmount their own inferiority complex or d) all of the above. Keanu ""Whoa"" Reeves is Shane Falco (catch the Alan Ladd reference?) a failed college football hero living down a disastrous performance in the 1996 Sugar Bowl in a ratty little houseboat where he makes a living scraping barnacles off the hulls of rich folks yachts. Since the ignominious choking he hasnt picked up a football except to toss a rusted metal one broken off a trophy he finds floating at the bottom of the harbor. Set in a mythical football league filled with ugly uniform color combinations that are not found in nature (thanks to the threat of legal action by NFL lawyers) ""The Replacements"" wastes no time cutting to the chase. After a midseason walkout by the professional football players union the Washington Sentinels bring gruff but lovable coaching legend Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman) out of retirement to quickly round up a team of scab players to take the team to the playoffs. Although set in D.C. the film was shot at Baltimores PSINet Stadium here redubbed ""Nextel Stadium"" in honor of another corporate giant too cheap to sponsor a real arena. Shane the Man With the Tarnished Golden Arm is tapped naturally for the quarterback slot Messiah to a bunch of gridiron wannabes with nothing better to do than wait for fate to come knocking. In the lineup a 500-pound sumo wrestler (Ace Yonamine); a fleet-footed but inept convenience store clerk (Orlando Jones); a washed-up Welsh soccer star (Rhys Ifans); a Bible-thumper (Troy Winbush); two gangsta rap bodyguards (Faizon Love and Michael ""Bear"" Taliferro); a hearing-impaired receiver (David Denman); an ex-con (Michael Jace); and a sadistic SWAT team cop (the frighteningly beefy Jon Favreau). Its not so much character-based as shtick-driven comedy The sumo wrestler barfs up a dozen barely digested eggs; the strippers hired to fill in as cheerleaders devise smutty ""Showgirls""-inspired dance routines. But when not indulging in least-common-denominator humor the film attempts to tap into our not-so-secret resentment of corporate sport greedheads and the overpriced divas on steroids with whom we have a love/hate relationship. After an early heart-rending defeat of the underdogs (clad in blindingly tacky red white and blue) were treated to a perversely satisfying scene in which Shane and Co. beat the living crud out of their off-field tormentors the spoiled whiners theyre replacing led by a smirking Brett Cullen. Dont forget Just like real football the Howard Deutch-directed film is about grunting and head-butting not acting and speechifying. At one point trying to motivate his team to victory Shane soliloquizes ""I wish I could say something classy and inspirational but . . ."" (But? But what Keanu? Cat got your tongue?) Even John Madden and Pat Summerall gamely playing themselves look like theyre having trouble not laughing and it isnt because the movie is sooooo darn funny. The moral as scripted by Vince (""Fly Away Home"") McKewin is this Teamwork is more important than individual glory and . . .chestnut of chestnuts . . . youve got to have heart. Admittedly heart is the one thing the film has going for it although its heart is of the flat foil-wrapped kind filled with stuff that rots your mind if not your teeth. Even the subplot of Shanes wooing of Annabelle (Brooke Langton) the gamine barkeep who moonlights as the captain of the cheerleading squad feels about as fake as Astroturf. Teamwork? Second chances? Boy gets girl? Whats so bad about all that you might ask? Okay okay ""The Replacements"" gets points for old-fashioned values and for making villains out of a bunch of millionaires in cleats. But thats a field goal not a touchdown. THE REPLACEMENTS (PG-13 114 minutes) - Contains profanity football violence a barroom brawl lewd cheerleading and egg vomit.
