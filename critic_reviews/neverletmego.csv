"Movie review Never Let Me Go washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movie review Never Let Me Go Carey Mulligan left Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield in the ambitious drama ""Never Let Me Go."" (Alex Bailey/fox Searchlight) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 24 2010 ""Never Let Me Go"" epitomizes the kind of somber aesthetically refined and morally engaged film that commands deep respect without inspiring much affection. Adapted from the highly regarded novel by Kazuo Ishiguro by director Mark Romanek (""One Hour Photo"") this ambitiously restrained film will most likely please fans of the books dire speculative vision even if it leaves others wondering why Ishiguros gruesome even sadistic premise merits such tender artistic ministrations. Like last years ""The Road"" adapted from a Cormac McCarthy novel ""Never Let Me Go"" offers filmgoers a haunting reminder of lifes most enduring questions -- in this case about how to wring meaning and love from our all-too-short time on earth -- but only after putting them through an imaginative journey that in its series of progressively more wrenching what-ifs borders on the cruel. Part of the propulsive power of ""Never Let Me Go"" lies in the mystery at its core so the fewer clues given by way of synopsis the better. The story is narrated by Kathy (Carey Mulligan) who as the movie opens explains that she started her young life in the 1970s at a well-tended British boarding school called Hailsham. There she befriended Ruth (Keira Knightley) and Tommy (Andrew Garfield) who along with Kathy live in a world that while in many ways sequestered and pampered has a castoff quality to it. The highlight of year at Hailsham is when a truckload of scarred heavily used toys arrived for the children to ""buy"" with tokens theyve earned. As Kathy Ruth and Tommy grow into a similarly obedient young adulthood the reality of their fate settles in with Kathy meanwhile having to come to terms with a romance between Ruth and Tommy. From Hailsham the trio eventually moves to a euphemistically named institution known as the Cottages where they befriend others like them and begin to question their fate. Filmed by Romanek in muted hues of gray and blue ""Never Let Me Go"" combines the bleak austerity of classic British miserablism with the almost-but-not-quite futuristic science fiction of ""Children of Men."" The films greatest strength is its sense of timelessness of an era that might have just passed or may just be impending. (Seen in the context of last summers talk of ""death panels"" and socialized medicine the storys doomsday scenario may strike some viewers as a bit too close for comfort.) Strong too are the films lead performances in roles that call for a combination of realism and otherworldly naivete -- especially from the luminous Mulligan whose Kathy combines steely resolve and aching vulnerability. But ultimately even the most sensitive efforts of Romanek and his estimable cast cant overcome the pall of fatalism that envelopes Ishiguros foreclosed universe. Then again that interpretation may be a function of perspective. Perhaps the most lasting lesson of ""Never Let Me Go"" is that one persons poetic testament to acceptance and human connection is anothers masochistic wallow in resignation and passivity.

You couldnt guess it from the cast list. Even watching the film the horrible reality is only gradually revealed. And yet its true Never Let Me Go is... a sci-fi movie.If ever proof were needed that cultural snobbery is alive and well its right here. Never Let Me Go is a film so ashamed of its own genre trappings that it goes to extreme and illogical lengths to pretend they dont exist. Carey Mulligan Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield play Kathy Ruth and Tommy pupils at a strange English boarding school who slowly learn that theyre being bred for a grim purpose - and one we cant fully reveal without a spoiler...Youve seen this movie before back in 2005 the same year Kazuo Ishiguro published his novel. Then it was called The Island and masked its numerous scripting deficiencies with a series of noisy action-packed escape scenes. No such luck here Ishiguros central point about human acquiescence to the inevitability of death is powerful on the page but on screen its flat and frustrating. Alex Garlands screenplays (28 Days Later Sunshine) often feel like they were written in the same time it takes to watch the film and this is no exception glossing over key emotional currents like the central love triangle and draining any sense of tension from the material.Mark Romaneks direction is icy and uninvolved but there are some lovely visual flourishes and his work with the actors is solid while Knightley flounders Mulligan and Garfield provide the films few effectively intimate moments as a star-crossed victims doomed to die. The result is pretty empty and immediately forgettable.

The first being that the characters inhabit a world where they are ""farmed"" from birth to provide organs for transplantation. The second ly that a rumoured means of reprieve from this terrible fate exists and yet is withheld from two of the lead characters by the third lead who conducts a sham relationship to block their chance for fleeting happiness. These two weak flat arguments are drawn out throughout the entire film in an unbelievable shallow fashion that says nothing about the realities of the human condition or human behaviour. At the same time the powerful themes that could have been highlighted have instead been portrayed with the passion and depth of a play describing the disappointment engendered by a village garden fete being cancelled due to warnings of bad weather.The acting is good on the whole but flattened again by the shallow characterisations and plot line. The shooting of the film itself has artistic merit without question but the music and screen atmosphere remains monotonous and once again overshadowed by the ludicrous propositions. The sadness of this film should be reserved for the audience and pity for those simple enough to be moved by it when there are far more potent stark and vivid tragedies played out in the real world every day and at all points. My opinion only of course so by all means enjoy and be moved if you can.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 25 2012ArdjunaFeaturedA thoroughly moving and thought-provoking piece sublimely acted and beautifully shot the two-star rating of this reviewer is at best unjustified.

Perhaps I could have appreciated if I hadnt read the book first but I couldnt stand the changes that were made in the adaptation. They seemed pointless and changed the relationships between the characters. There was a lack of insight into the characters thoughts and far too much of the plot was removed or altered. Having said that Carey Mulligan did a great job as Kathy. I just wish that Kazuo Ishiguros text had come through instead of a typical tear-jerking movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 2 2011MaddyFeaturedI loved the book and somehow the film was even more moving.

I guess Tom Huddleston would probably complain about a lack of decent guitar solos in a Mahler symphony... oops no Im being a cultural snob apart from the fact it doesnt really work... Take time Mr H and let the structure and emotions of this moving and thoughtful adaptation percolate through to whatever sensibilities are buried beneath the surface of your prejudicial mindset. Perhaps then you will understand the difference between NLMG and ""The Island"" and get how Ishiguros message relates to the world we live in today without having to relegate a movie to its genre and then judge whether it has enough action to qualify as ""good sci-fi"".FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 4 2011OliviaFeaturedI agree with this short review although it doesnt quite convey how awful this film is. While the acting and cinematography are for the most part decent the premise and narrative thrust of the film are so hackneyed vacuous and just plain stupid to merit anyones attention. The characters who seem to represent a strange analogue of the human being without any of this creatures most vital characteristics are not developed in any significant way and the viewer does not get much involved in their fates. Its a great shame that a film that could have explored mortality love freedom and the future of health in an engaging and intelligent way had to line it all with sentimentality and cliche all under the benevolent gaze of the British rural aesthetic.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 1 2011Richard CarterFeaturedWell you can certainly rely on Time Outs film reviews. Go to a load of pretentious incompetently filmed BS like Heartbeats and Time Out gives it four stars. But go to a finely-made moving and sensitive film examining a fundamental subject like life and death in this case Never Let Me Go and what does Time Out produce? A classic whine and a ludicrous comparison with The Island. I went to see NLMG knowing nothing at all about it beforehand (for all I knew it could have been the latest Jennifer Aniston crapfest) and was deeply impressed by a serious view of the issues here (dont want to give too much away with spoilers even at this late stage). But I suppose theres one good thing about this review you can as ever rely on a Time Out review in that if TO says its good itll be shite and if TO says its bad it may well be as good as this film is.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 30 2011LilliFeaturedGuy who wrote this surely did sleep when they was trying to teach him in school - anything.. and surely did skip a lot in life when is not able to recognize to true clean and feeling bigger than ourselves.

It concerns me that a supposedly good film critic is so limited by his own perceptions of what genre ought to be- heaven forbid someone might do something different. It is also a little embarassing that he can not imagine a sci-fi film without shiny surfaces and blinking lights...

I found Never Let Me Go a very powerful film for a number of reasons. The frequent lack of rebellion was a chilling consequence of the near-universal acceptance of inhumanity - as if the Nazis had won in Britain (and perhaps commenting on Brits frequent phlegmatic acceptance). A very thoughtful adaptation of the excellent book. The privileged world of Hailsham turns the romance of Harry Potter on its head (and perhaps Ishiguro is commenting on Oxbridge as an isstitution too). All actors including Keira Knightley portray their characters in their situation really well.

Something is missing in this film. In fact the 1st 30mins the 3 main cast are in their early teens and played by child actors and I have to say this was the most interesting part of the film. The rest was done in such a typical English way. None of the characters had any backbone. It becomes increasingly irritating watching these 3 characters accept their fate and literally do nothing about it. No fight no rebelling just complete acceptance. Which I feel is just not true to life even for us monotone apologetic English folk This is not a film to be watched more than once.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 11 2011Dariush AlaviFeaturedFor what its worth Id like to say that I couldnt disagree more with this review. I adore Ishiguros novel so it was with a considerable sense of relief - and a fair amount of surprise - that I found myself thoroughly impressed by Mark Romaneks vision of Never Let Me Go. Adhering to the same structure as the source material the movie looks through the eyes and memories of Kathy H (played with heart-breaking restraint by Carey Mulligan) to follow the lives of three children as they grow up and learn that the world has a very specific frightening fate in store for them. The writing and visual style are evidence of a sincere intelligent (and largely successful) attempt to tell a story that confronts uncomfortable psychological truths. The performances are first-rate (for once even Keira Knightleys canine-baring leer is well used) Rachel Portmans music memorably underscores the bleakness and Adam Kimmels photography adds a suitable touch of other-worldliness to proceedings. Just ignore the final voiceovers redundant and explicit spelling out of one of the central themes.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 11 2011Dariush AlaviFeaturedFor what its worth Id like to say that I couldnt disagree more with this review.

And depressing. Its exquisitely acted. And depressing. Its romantic profound and superbly crafted shot with the self-contained radiance of a snow globe. And its depressing. Its depressing if youve read the book which I loved and its depressing if you havent. If that doesnt persuade you let me restate the point ITS DEPRESSING. So long as a print still exists somewhere of Requiem for a Dream it is not the biggest downer ever made. But it comes close. Directed by Mark Romanek (One Hour Photo) from a screenplay by Alex Garland (28 Days Later and The Beach both movie and novel) Never Let Me Go is based on Kazuo Ishiguros haunting 2005 novel about three dewy youths coming of age in an alternate Britain. It stars Keira Knightley Andrew Garfield and Carey Mulligan as Ruth Kathy and Tommy graduates of a perfect starchy English boarding school the sort of place where lads and lasses do their lessons in gray woolen sweaters. In 1978 the three youngsters (played in flashbacks by Ella Purnell Isobel Meikle-Small and Charlie Rowe) form a triangle of friendship and nascent desire in a carefully ordered setting removed from the outside world. Their story is dystopian for one specific reason -- a horror the book divulged in snippets and jots as we learned about Kathys important work as a ""carer."" By contrast the film blows much of the mystery early on opening with a preface and a quick flash-forward to unspeakable sadness near the end. This one scene with one sheet of Plexiglas divides the fates of two important characters and quashes any chance of suspense. We know whats coming and its a bummer. Im guessing Garland took this dirgelike approach because it gets the sci-fi business out of the way allowing the narrative to dwell on loftier matters the brevity of life the mistiness of lost dreams the role of art in reflecting humanity. Viewers may (understandably) question why no one in this somber British other world tries to escape their circumstances but destiny - and the will to accept it - are two of the films more rarefied subjects. Graceful surrender is a tall order for actors of any age. Mulligan and Garfield young stars with old souls display a knowing sweetness that gives Never Let Me Go its broken heart. In smaller parts Charlotte Rampling shows up as the schools ramrod headmistress and Sally Hawkins tamps down her Happy-Go-Lucky ebullience as a boarding school ""guardian"" who speaks hard truths to her roomful of charges. Also wafting through the halls Nathalie Richard as ""Madame"" an enigmatic Frenchwoman who collects the childrens artwork for a gallery of unknown location and purpose. Tommy has his theories which he articulates in a scene that begins with hope yields to disappointment and arrives finally at impossible pain. Garfields lopsided grin reveals all we need to know about youth and innocence lost.

"Never Let Me Go (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Never Let Me Go (PG-13) The acclaimed novel makes the leap to film with its melancholy intact. Carey Mulligan Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield in ""Never Let Me Go"" Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald10/6/2010 Editor rating 3 Never Let Me Go director Mark Romaneks introspective adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguros novel is a work of subtle beauty - a melancholy meditation on the finality of life and the choices we make as our time shortens. That observation might make the movie sound like a downer but its not. The film is sad in a beautiful peaceful manner and its exploration of mortality is different from most others since the three central protagonists are all barely in their 30s. Kathy (Carey Mulligan) Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley) have been friends since childhood when they attended Hailsham boarding school in 1978. The pastoral facility seems like an idyllic place to grow up although there are curious rules. The students must never set foot outside the school grounds for instance or they are certain to die horrible deaths. ""Keeping yourself healthy inside is of paramount importance Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) tells her pupils a curious way of encouraging kids to remain fit. Never Let Me Go which was adapted by screenwriter Alex Garland lets you know from the outset that this seemingly ordinary story belongs to the science-fiction genre. A title card at the beginning informs us among other things that due to medical advances human life expectancy had passed 100 years by 1967. But those advances have come with a cost. ""None of you will do anything but live the life that has been laid out for you another teacher Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins) tells the students. ""You have to know who you are and what you are. Its the only way youll lead decent lives. Miss Lucy is promptly fired for her lack of discretion but the kids remain unperturbed - and stay that way after they graduate from Hailsham when they turn 18 and relocate to a collection of remote farm buildings known as The Cottages where they are free to minglebut discouraged from venturing too often into town. Kathy who harbored a raging crush on Tommy when they were younger stands aside silently when he and Ruth become a couple as teenagers. Of the trio Kathy the films narrator is the quietest and most observant. Tommy who has managed to control the tantrums he suffered as a boy seems to drift along wherever the current takes him. Ruth who appears at times to be motivated by jealousy and resentment is the most eager to enjoy whatever pleasures life has to offer as if she were racing against some looming clock. There is a critical element in the premise of Never Let Me Go I havent mentioned because the movie like the book unfurls it gradually allowing the consequences and repercussions of the idea to gather resonance and power as the characters get older. Romanek (One Hour Photo) shoots the film in a quiet style that mirrors Ishiguros  delicate prose and although the protagonists dilemma is specific and otherworldly the feelings they experience and their unspoken resignation to their fate are universal. Never Let Me Go argues that life preordained or not is what we choose to make of it and that sadness can be a valuable and useful tool to help us recognize moments of fleeting beauty that otherwise may have passed unnoticed.

Alex Bailey/Fox Searchlight/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Never Let Me Go"" adapted from the acclaimed 2006 novel by Kazuo Ishiguro and directed by Mark Romanek is a dystopian creepfest about British boarding school students who are cultivated for a nefarious purpose I shall not disclose. But I can say that director Mark Romanek in making parable about the life force and its losses overdoes the lifelessness. The films imperious drabness is doubtless intentional but it makes for a wearying experience.The excellent cast is headed by Carey Mulligan Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield. They have a depleted slightly zombified demeanor and you feel for them. ""Never Let Me Go"" is strangely moving and mournful but I wish more had been made of the beauty these people are relinquishing if only as a counterweight to all that artful drear.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 24 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Not often does a work of science fiction blithely ignore the science in the fiction calmly forego the future for the recent past and quietly swap a world we clearly remember for a dystopian alternative. Kazuo Ishiguros novel Never Let Me Go does all of that but so subtly and with such understated power that the emotional impact creeps up on the reader only gradually. Then bam it hits forcefully memorably and yes never lets us go. Video Never Let Me Go The official trailer For all these reasons this is a very tricky book to adapt into a movie. The delicate tone that is essential on the page is hard to duplicate on the screen where it can easily spill over at the extremes - too sensational on one side too mawkish on the other. Clearly aware of the dangers another novelist Alex Garland has done a fine job coming up with a screenplay that respects both the mood of the text and the nature of the plot the way the dystopian details leak out in a very gradual muted progression. Yet maybe the film is over-respectful because something big goes missing here. That bam factor is gone What we see is admirable but what we feel is minimal. The picture is framed in the voiceover of our narrator the soft-spoken Kathy H. (Carey Mulligan) who says right at the outset ""Ive been a carer for 11 years. ... Carers and donors have endured so much."" Carers? Donors? Although the setting is a recognizable England in the 1990s the words strike us as odd as does her casual mention that for decades now humans have routinely lived to 100 years of age. Before weve finished pondering that tidbit the scene flashes back to 1978 to a bucolic British boarding school called Hailsham which the young Kathy attended. On the surface the school appears familiar enough with its uniformed students and starchy headmistress. But again theres a palpable oddness to the place and to this speculative past. The clothes the manners the relative absence of technology all seem more like 38 than 78 as if the society has advanced medically yet has stalled everywhere else. Director Mark Romanek creates this dissonant atmosphere then just lets it waft over us like thin fog. Here were introduced to Kathys childhood friends the aggressively confident Ruth and the shy sensitive perhaps troubled Tommy. More important were also given a crucial piece of exposition that I cant disclose but that colours the rest of the picture and establishes the dark heart of the dystopia. Once that revelation arrives the action flashes forward to 1985 with the friends now in their late teens and living communally at a rural cottage. There a conventional love triangle forms with Ruth (Keira Knightley) bedding Tommy (Andrew Garfield) leaving Kathy to look on from a frustrated distance pining for the man she doesnt have. At this stage the story stalls noticeably and the pacing that once seemed deliberately measured now feels just plodding. But things pick up again with the final jump to 1994 when more of the hard dystopian facts emerge. Now those ominous words - carer donor - make awful sense. As they do we glimpse what the movie is really about. Scrape away the sci-fi trappings and this is really a treatise on mortality on how frail humans cling to false hopes and happy rationales desperately trying to distract themselves from the fate that sooner or later awaits us all. Ingeniously Ishiguro found a way of compressing that universal dilemma for his three protagonists forcing them to face it tragically sooner than most. In the book their predicament is harrowingly bizarre and yet peculiarly familiar too. Of course its the familiarity that empathetically bonds them to us and creates that emotional explosion. But in the film despite Garlands best efforts and an exemplary cast that bond never quite forms not even in the climactic and pitiable last frames. There were allowed to watch far too dispassionately and to let go far too easily - for all this movies many virtues thats its fatal flaw.

Comments Never Let Me Go Rated R  104 minutes  2010 Kazuo Ishiguros brilliant 2005 novel Never Let Me Go is inherently unfilmable; narrated by a 31-year-old woman who tends to the needs of various organ donors it thrives on the slowly accumulating tension between the proper British reserve of her prose and the horrible reality lurking beneath the surface of her story. In adapting it to the screen Alex Garland (Sunshine 28 Days Later . . .) delivers all the plot highlights following three children at an exclusive rural boarding school as they grow to adulthood (at which point theyre played by Carey Mulligan Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield). But the theme of Ishiguros novel--that we all construct delicate fictions to mask the dehumanization of modern life--proves so elusive onscreen that by the last scene it has to be spelled out in a clumsy didactic voice-over. The movie is admirable for its resolutely bleak tone and its three stars among the cream of young British movie actors are always worth watching. But for Gods sake read the book first.

Im not necessarily advocating for more but the combination of social anguish and dark chill in Never Let Me Go packs a quietly devastating punch.The kids at Hailsham a stately boarding school in the English countryside are being groomed for something special. Theyre told by the headmistress (an impervious Charlotte Rampling) that theyre different and before long we discover what their special purpose might be. Hint Its not good for them.Carey Mulligan (also in theaters this week in Wall Street Money Never Dies) Andrew Garfield (who shows up again next week in The Social Network) and Keira Knightley are the troika at the core of the film adapted by Mark Romanek from Kazuo Ishiguros novel. Enshrouded in mystery and muted colors their lives diverge and intersect in a dance of yearning and fatalism that culminates in a desperate act of grace.The end results are more implied than explicit but theyre haunting nonetheless.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter chrisvognar.R (some sexuality and nudity).

Run time 103 minutes.===Spoiler alert Critics reviewing films with a twist are caught in a conundrumBy CHRIS VOGNAR / The Dallas Morning News cvognardallasnews.comBy now you may have heard about this hot new documentary called Catfish and you probably know its not about a mud-dwelling creature that goes well with Cajun spices. It follows a guy who meets some people on Facebook. Id go into more detail but I dont want to spoil the ending not to mention the studios ingenious marketing strategy that includes a faux horror-movie trailer and the new genre tag ""reality thriller."" (Someone deserves a raise for conjuring that phrase.)Whats it really about? Its about 86 minutes long.Thankfully some films come about their mystique a bit more honestly. I wanted to write an essay dealing with the central theme of Never Let Me Go - until I realized that would give away a crucial plot point revealed only gradually and rather artfully in the film. Never Let Me Go is based on a beloved novel by Kazuo Ishiguro which means at least some viewers will know going in that ""To Serve Man"" is really a cookbook. Oh wait thats an old Twilight Zone episode. Never mind.Whats a movie critic to do when spoilers are afoot? Ignore the consumer mandate for preserved surprise and you take your life into your own hands. Write around the very ideas that form a movies identity and youre likely to end up with the written equivalent of thin air. Type the words ""spoiler alert"" or ""SPOILER ALERT"" if subtlety isnt your thing and youre asking the reader to move on to something else.The spoiler question represents a larger critical conundrum. The reviewer conventional wisdom has it is only supposed to tell you what to see or avoid. The critic ideally is charged with the task of extrapolating the greater cultural meaning of a particular work or group of works - which gets tough when little things such as plot become off-limits.The problem is hardly new. Marketing mastermind Alfred Hitchcock created a built-in stir for his 1960 shocker Psycho. The tagline says it all or rather says nothing at all ""No One ... BUT NO ONE ... Will Be Admitted to the Theatre After the Start of Each Performance of Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho."" The gambit essentially turned the entire movie into one giant spoiler Show up five minutes late and its all ruined. Just think what shenanigans Hitchcock could have cooked up with the Internet at his disposal.Spoiler rage has a history as well. Peanuts fans will recall the time Lucy spilled the beans about Citizen Kane to an infuriated Linus ""Rosebud was his sled."" (No apologies forthcoming here; Kane is now 69 years old. If you havent seen it by now you might want to cast your blame in the mirror.)But if spoiler rules have been around the block theyve also evolved along with the way we consume media. For instance Im one of those poor schlubs who love Mad Men but havent yet caught up to the current season. As I plug away on Season 3 via DVD I plug my ears and do the ""nah nah nah nah"" thing whenever my more cutting-edge friends are around to discuss the latest escapades of Don Draper and friends. I lag behind in the space-time continuum and thats nobodys fault but mine. For some reason my friends comply with my spoiler aversion and keep the latest episodes pretty hush-hush. At least they will until they read this column.Its quite a responsibility preserving secrets to maintain suspense. Certain movies lean heavily on the aha moment and hell hath no fury like a viewer prematurely clued in.So we keep practicing the sleight of hand required to keep you in just the right amount of dark. The results may end up as muddy as a Catfish  but the element of surprise remains intact. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Never Let Me Go The burden of being special | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNever Let Me Go The burden of being specialIn the dystopian anti-thriller Never Let Me Go the students of Hailsham boarding school are told that theyre special and the reason why is shocking to hear.Carey Mulligan left and Keira Knightley star in Never Let Me Go.  (HANDOUT)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Sept. 23 2010Never Let Me Go(out of 4)Starring Carey Mulligan Keira Knightley Andrew Garfield Charlotte Rampling and Sally Hawkins. Directed by Mark Romanek. At the Varsity. 104 minutes. 14AThe hardest part of any screen adaptation of a well-known book it seems to me is getting the rhythms in sync.You want to pay due homage to the source work which is sacred text to many. At the same time you must recognize that the moving image and the printed word are distinctively different. Its like translating languages you can get the literal meaning while missing the nuances that say so much more.Article Continued BelowMark Romanek (One Hour Photo) wrestles with this conundrum a bit in Never Let Me Go his handsome distillation of Kazuo Ishiguros best-selling dystopian sci-fi novel of the same name.Romanek is faithful almost to a fault to Ishiguros elegant prose which floats across the page like a cloud in a Monet painting. Working with screenwriter Alex Garland (28 Days Later) Romanek necessarily removes some of the novels incidents and moves up the shocking truth that the book doesnt spell out until nearly a third of the way through it.The result is something that might be described as a chilling anti-thriller where the tension is more implied than shown. It may rob the film of drama but Romanek has erred on the side of quality crafting a beautifully cast and artfully rendered allegory of lost youth and trampled innocence.Chances are you know the full story of Never Let Me Go which is told both in film and book from the nostalgic perspective of a vaguely sad woman known only as Kathy H. played by Carey Mulligan. Now 31 years old preparing for the brave new world that awaits her she tells of curious events dating back to 1978.Im going to assume that you dont already know Kathys story and tread carefully to avoid spoiling a reveal that is deliberately ""told but not told"" to the students of Hailsham boarding school for most of their proscribed lives.While at Hailsham Kathy befriends two other students mischievous Ruth (Keira Knightley) and earnest Tommy (Andrew Garfield). They share her curiosity about what it is thats really going on at Hailsham and also at the other sheltered places with blandly threatening names like The Cottages where students are moved as they grow into teenagers and adults.""The students of Hailsham are special"" no-nonsense headmistress Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) tells her charges at school assembly. Theyre not quite sure why theyre special being too young to take on board exactly what their role in life is. There is much Orwellian use of the language with words such as ""carer"" ""donor"" and ""completion"" having meaning beyond their youthful ken.They are ""told but not told"" until the day when sympathetic teacher Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins) decides she can tolerant the deception no longer. She lays it out to her students so baldly the information hits like a sledgehammer even for those who already know or suspect whats coming.At this point in most sci-fi sagas such as a similarly themed movie by Michael Bay the plot would turn to methods of escape. This is not the intent of Romanek or of author Ishiguro.The students seek answers not crowbars and those seeking thrills might wish they were seeing a different movie. But if they were elsewhere theyd be missing something truly unique.Never Let Me Go isnt just another sci-fi adventure. Its a coming-of-age saga that fully understands the stresses and confusion of that netherworld between idyllic childhood and demanding adulthood.Its also a meditation on what it means to be human. Are we literally just the sum of our parts? Or is there something out there of great import beyond the sheltering and threatening gates of our own personal Hailshams?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

In Kazuo Ishiguros bestseller a 1952 medical ""breakthrough"" revealed a method of reversing once-incurable diseases and extending the average lifespan to 100 years. But it requires organ donations. Lots and lots of them. Forty-some years later its one of societys awkward little inequities that a special class of children are bred to supply replacement parts for their elders. Similarly themed films such as ""Logans Run"" and Michael Bays ""The Island"" treated bioethics as the starting point for bombastic games of laser tag. ""Never Let Me Go"" belongs to a higher-minded category of entertainment; think Merchant Ivory sci-fi. It doesnt set out to pummel your senses but to stimulate thought and send little shivers up your spine. And it succeeds completely. Set in England the film is told through the voice of Kathy H. (Carey Mulligan) who mingles memories of her youth with her current position as a ""carer."" Carers function as surrogate next-of-kin for ""donors"" compassionately visiting them before and after their operations and signing the funeral paperwork when they ""complete"" usually after two or three surgeries. Kathy does her job with pride awaiting the time when she will become a donor. The Orwellian euphemisms the gentle totalitarianism of the medical establishment and the sheeplike acceptance of these outrages are quietly horrific. Anyone who protests that such things could never happen needs a refresher course on 20th-century history. We move back in time to Kathys education at Hailsham boarding school where placid headmistress Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) methodically grinds down independent thought. Kathy tenderhearted Tommy D. (future ""Spider-Man"" Andrew Garfield) and lovely manipulative Ruth (Keira Knightley) form a youthful romantic triangle whose outcome may determine their futures. To say more would be to spoil developments that viewers should have the pleasure of discovering themselves. The actors excel in revealing the passions buried within characters whose feelings have been intentionally stunted to ensure docility. Mulligans achingly expressive face is the window into Kathys sweet and gentle soul while Garfield uses his gawky physicality to capture Tommys trusting immaturity and his ultimate desperation. Ruth is the most complex of the three maneuvering herself between the natural partners because she envies their connection. Knightley often dismissed as a mere pretty face demonstrates surprising depth and feeling in the role. We shouldnt be surprised; director Mark Romanek is a specialist in understated emotional violence. He drew out one of Robin Williams finest dramatic performances in 2002s ominous ""One Hour Photo."" The fate of the young characters could be read as a metaphor for any segment of society whose humanity is routinely denied but this film is far more than a civics lesson in disguise. It asks us to consider deep questions about love and mortality and our docile willingness to walk paths that others have chosen for us -- ""for our own good"" naturally. ""Never Let Me Go"" is a bleak and heartbreaking cautionary tale about how we all behave before we ""complete."" How bleak and even how heartbreaking one does not realize until the devastating final scene. It deserves an honored place on the small shelf of philosophical science fiction alongside ""Gattaca"" ""Children of Men"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"" though it could not be more different. NEVER LET ME GO  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for some sexuality and nudity. Theater Uptown.

As children living at the cloistered Hailsham School (there are juvenile doppelgA$?ngers in the roles later assumed by the three stars) Ruth Kathy and Tommy are led to believe they are something special To maintain their bodies in salutary condition is a high priority as the headmistress (Charlotte Rampling) and her faculty emphasize. But art too is encouraged. And the grounds of the school with its verdant lawns and cricket pitches feel like an exceptional place.Exceptional but also strange.If you havent read Ishiguros book or read about it or seen the trailer for Never Let Me Go it might take a while to figure out exactly whats going on with Ruth Kathy Tommy and their Hailsham mates. The nature of who they are and why they are is revealed in modest increments that scanner by the front door that the students must brush their wrists across as they come and go; the mysterious deliveries of secondhand toys and games; the quick exit of a teacher (Sally Hawkins) too forthright in her talks with the children.And then Ruth Kathy and Tommy are children no more but young adults sent to live in ""the Cottages"" - a rustic encampment where they pass the time between visits to . . . the hospital. Ruth and Tommy become a pair but it is clear from the wistful looks that Kathy throws Tommy and Tommy her that the wrong two have partnered.All three are very sharp here Knightley dark-haired and deliberate brings nuance and humor to what could have been a brittle role. Garfield with the look of a scared rabbit in his eyes casts a sweet and sensitive aura a shaggy gawky figure with an artists soul. And Mulligan who provides the films spare rueful voice-overs barely gets through the scenes without bursting into tears. But thats being unfair Although the actress Kathy seems on the brink of crying its a tamped-down and delicate performance really.Alex Garland the screenwriter and novelist (28 Days Later . . . The Beach) and Mark Romanek the director (One Hour Photo) have created an alternate universe that exudes some of the creepy calm of Wolf Rillas great English science-fiction flick Village of the Damned but also the gloomy romanticism of Keats and Shelley.With its mix of Masterpiece Theatre Britain (thatched and hedgerowed villages misty seaside towns) and modernist institutional architecture the landscapes our ill-fated threesome tread are full of sullen allure.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Has a movie contained more frowning than ""Never Let Me Go? Even the smiles carry a hint of dejection. The bones in Keira Knightleys face have always been capable of geometric angles. The geometry here is numbingly sad. The angles all point downward. Such is life for the girls and boys schooled at Englands Hailsham. The academy which the movie introduces in the late 1970s is a sort of sick joke on prep school. Its students are human clones being prepared for organ donation. They seem to know but cant entirely grasp their fate. The headmistress (Charlotte Rampling) has instilled in her inorganic pupils a sense of altruistic nobility.In the meantime an attraction kicks up among three students and hangs over them into adulthood. As teenagers Ruth (Knightley) claims Tommy (Andrew Garfield) the strange slow stork of a young man whom Kathy (Carey Mulligan) truly loves. Years later when Ruth and Tommy reenter Kathys life the dynamics of the relationships shift. All the reflection that occurs here turns what is an intricately dolorous five-year-old novel by the Englishman Kazuo Ishiguro into a concave mirror.Ruth Tommy and Kathy who provides the films narration make their way from one cold gray generically stately setting to the next (beaches cottages the beach again). They negotiate their current feelings with respect to their adolescent ones and seeing them do so is like watching meek innocent farm animals wait for slaughter. ""The Silence of the Lambs would have been a better title. The late central action as it were involves the pursuit of a deferral for Tommys surgical donation.Ishiguro writes delicate novels of taciturnity. Theyre almost completely interior in the way that a lot of fiction is. With him theres almost no mood action either. Like a lot of interior narrative fiction that hasnt deterred the movies attention. In Ishiguros case his romantic suppression was ripe for an Ismail Merchant-James Ivory-Ruth Prawer Jhabvala production which his ""Remains of the Day became in 1993. They were made for each other Both parties shared a determination to keep the stops in and the stops tended to result in several hours in a stuffy museum.The director of ""Never Let Me Go is Mark Romanek who would appear to be the opposite of Merchant-Ivory. Romanek is an American whose many music videos -- he did Michael and Janet Jacksons ""Scream  -- reveal a stylist with an exceptional eye for bodies color close-ups lighting space and atmosphere. Amazingly ""Never Let Me Go could have been assembled from the Merchant-Ivory kit. Its stale with suppressed anguish.Working from an attenuated script by the novelist Alex Garland Romanek imbues his movie with a great deal of seriousness but not much life. This could be a consequence of the material -- these clones are inexorably depressed. But it is also a problem of tastefulness. The movie extends its wistfulness without making a fuss of the suffering. Ishiguro gets away with this because he was writing from Kathys point of view. Shes what the book and film call a ""carer which means she nurses pre- and post-op ""donors.The movie diffuses its perspective until it assumes the proportions of a love tragedy illustrated with images of loneliness (a rusty old beached tugboat) or one-way longing -- Kathy flips through the pages of a dirty magazine. What shes searching for should be poignant. Intellectually I suppose it is. But the trouble with the movie is that Romanek isnt much of an emotionalist. His previous film ""One-Hour Photo from 2005 generated most of its creepiness from its close-ups of a sadistic Robin Williams not from any true psychological curiosity. Romaneks filmmaking doesnt seem quite as interested in the characters in ""Never Let Me Go as it is interested in how they look in the frame. Those interests dont have to be exclusive but they are here.The licks of casual science fiction stir some hope. Ruth is told that her ""original has been sighted and she and her friends head into town to get a look. What she finds is as anticlimactic for her as it is for us. This is material that needs a stronger vision or some recklessness to wake it up. Knightley seems the most eager for mischief although Garfield who works in a fraught variation on teen gawkiness is the least predictable person in the cast. Mulligan who like Knightley is 25 has appeared in over a dozen movies in the last five years. Shes peevish in most of them. Her smiles always seem to be making tears. None of the actors is completely at home in Romaneks hushed climes.The problem with stillness here is that its both the antithesis of youth and a signifier of wisdom. In the absence of youth and wisdom the predominant inertia points up a discomfort with forward progression. The years in this movie do seem to pass but the entire thrust travels backward. All anybody wants to talk about is the past. The handsome images often seem to match. The film feels like a J. Crew catalog from 1985.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Never Let Me Go review Great book yields a good-enough film - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Never Let Me Go review Great book yields a good-enough filmNever Let Me Go 3 starsSeptember 23 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticFans of a book have a hard time adjusting their expectations regarding a film adaptation. Its not fair to the filmmakers. And yet there it is. ""Never Let Me Go"" taken from Kazuo Ishiguros 2005 novel (which is I think very nearly flawless) works on its own terms. Its unified sense of craft and relentless good taste reflect a series of careful exacting creative decisions from the proper chill of the visual tones (Adam Kimmel was cinematographer) to the correctness of the casting. Screenwriter Alex Garland wisely was no slave to fidelity to the original in terms of narrative contours; he went his own way with it stating certain things upfront that Ishiguro held back until the novels midpoint. Not all the choices work but theyre interesting. Now Why isnt it great like the book? Why is it merely good? First lets deal with why and how its good which is difficult enough to achieve with demanding material. Carey Mulligan narrates the story. She is one of contemporary films most striking talents and here she portrays Kathy H. who works as a ""carer"" overseeing and counseling ""donors."" (This we see in the first scene.) Most of the film directed by Mark Romanek delves into flashbacks to Kathys younger days at an English boarding school known as Hailsham. There her companions are Ruth a rather snippy and manipulative sort played by Keira Knightley and the young man they both like in different ways guileless hot-tempered but sweet-natured Tommy played by Andrew Garfield. Hailsham is a place devoted to the care and protection of its student body and Romanek prowls its halls and grounds and fundamental purpose with stealthy skill. The script respects the books three-part structure. At a certain age Kathy Tommy and Ruth leave the school and live in ""The Cottages"" after which comes their true mission in life. This relates back to what we learn in the opening minutes of the film with Kathy the carer gazing through hospital glass. Romaneks command of the story is undeniable. Charlotte Rampling and Sally Hawkins playing two very different Hailsham educators are no less convincing than the central trio. There is a limitation however to Romaneks sense of drama as was the case with his creepy earlier feature ""One Hour Photo."" Hes a mood sustainer foremost and a (fairly subtle) dread peddler. When you add in such elements as Rachel Portmans aggressively fraught musical score you have a film adaptation that ever-so-artfully piles it on in a way that novelist Ishiguro (whose earlier works include ""The Remains of the Day"") never did. Surely this is a film to give almost anyone pause about national health initiatives should they come to this. But ""Never Let Me Go"" concerns a lot more than that. The film is a success. It works. Greatness eludes it yes. But greatness eludes almost every film adaptation of a major novel which we must remember when confronted by a good one. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for language some sex and drug content) Cast Carey Mulligan (Kathy); Andrew Garfield (Tommy); Keira Knightley (Ruth); Charlotte Rampling (Miss Emily); Sally Hawkins (Miss Lucy) Credits Directed by Mark Romanek; written by Alex Garland based on the novel by Kazuo Ishiguro; produced by Andrew Macdonald and Allon Reich.

"Never Let Me Go | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; never-let-me-go ) Never Let Me Go (United Kingdom/United States 2010) September 21 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli It is an accepted truth that adapting a sublime novel does not always result in a sublime movie. To an extent this is the problem with Never Let Me Go Alex Garlands adaptation of Kazuo Ishigurus book. The films tone which attempts to capture the thoughtful style of the written version is almost too solemn and reverent. The pace is slow-moving almost to a fault treading along the line where meditative crosses over into somnambulant. When it comes to observing its central three characters Never Let Me Go rarely stumbles but in filling in the blanks around them and developing the world and society of which they are victims the movie (even more than the book) leaves us hanging. The story is in a way a victim of its own inventiveness in that it provides a fascinating backstory that is addressed only in throw-away lines and insignificant subplots. Ultimately the characters are less interesting than their circumstances but those circumstances are of secondary importance. Technically Never Let Me Go is science fiction taking place in an alternate reality. Much like Children of Men however the movie is interested only in its sci-fi aspects as a way to investigate dramatic potential. The premise argues that during the 1950s science evolved a way to extend the human life span beyond 100 years. The impetus behind this was the creation of clones whose sole purpose is to donate organs. They grow up in orphanage-like farms are indoctrinated with an understanding of their purpose and shortly after reaching adulthood are ""harvested"" for the good of mankind. There are two classes of clones ""donors"" and ""carers"" - the latter help the former through the harvesting process until it is their time to join the donor ranks. Death is never spoken of. When a clone reaches the end of his usefulness typically after three or four donations he is referred to as having ""completed."" Death is a term reserved only for human beings. Never Let Me Go focuses on three characters. We meet them as young children at the exclusive Hailsham Academy where they live and study. Ruth (Ella Purnell) is the alpha child with Kathy (Isobel Meikle-Small) following in her wake. Both are interested in Tommy (Charlie Rowe) but he is too weak to resist Ruths advances even though he prefers Kathy. Roughly ten years later they have left Hailsham for The Cottages where they will begin to experience life outside the rarified atmosphere of the place in which they grew up. Ruth (now played by Kiera Knightley) is still with Tommy (Andrew Garfield) while Kathy (Carey Mulligan) continues to function as a third wheel. By now its clear to all three that if true love exists it does so between Kathy and Tommy not Tommy and Ruth but Ruth is too frightened of being alone and unloved to let go of Tommy and Tommy is too timid to break with Ruth and pursue Kathy. Essentially like Ishiguros The Remains of the Day this is about longing and unfulfilled (although not necessarily unrequited) love. The film resists the obvious allegorical possibilities. The clones plight is not a stand-in for slavery for example. In fact Never Let Me Go is largely uninterested in questions about the clones standing in society or their inherent humanity. The latter is treated as a given (in the beginning we dont know they are ""different"" from other human beings - that revelation occurs gradually during the course of the narrative) and when it is raised during a pivotal scene it comes as a surprise to the characters that there would be a question about their having souls. Perhaps questions about what qualifies a creature as ""life"" are so commonplace within science fiction that further exploration of them were deemed unnecessary within this framework. Mark Romanek a highly respected music video director making his follow-up to One Hour Photo has crafted a motion picture that is as visually impressive as it is emotionally distant. The look of the film even in its near-contemporary scenes feels trapped in the 50s and 60s as if the medical breakthrough that extends lives somehow slowed all other aspects of living. There are also some lovely individual shots a few of which evoke a melancholy sense of yearning. (Not surprising since the movie is presented from Kathys perspective.) The performances are of the highest caliber. Kiera Knightleys portrayal is more brittle that what we have become accustomed to from her but she softens toward the end. Knightley does a great deal with a poorly developed character. Andrew Garfield who played the lead in the first chapter of the Red Riding trilogy shows aspects of strength and insecurity and his reaction to a key revelation is striking. At the heart and soul of Never Let Me Go is Carey Mulligan and although her work here isnt as transcendent as what she provided in An Education this is nevertheless an example of multi-faceted acting. It is also worth noting that care was taken in choosing the actors to play the younger versions of the characters since all three bear resemblances to their older counterparts. Never Let Me Go is a moody film but the slowness at which it progresses and the way in which the emotions are dampened to create an introspective feeling can lull the viewer almost to sleep. Never Let Me Go requires patience but one has to wonder whether it has earned the right to make such a demand on its audience. The film is neither thematically deep nor emotionally powerful. Yes we experience regret at times but its a fleeting feeling lacking the potency to linger. The production is gorgeously rendered and splendidly acted but theres a sense that the whole may be significantly less than the sum of its parts.

By David Denby Credit Illustration by Robert Risko In Woody Allens perverse and fascinating ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" set in London Alfie (Anthony Hopkins) a grizzled and barrel-chested plutocrat perhaps seventy years old leaves his wife of forty years Helena (Gemma Jones) and marries what used to be called a floozy--the fun-loving alarmingly mobile hooker Charmaine (Lucy Punch) who quickly restores Alfies sex life and empties his bank account. After a strenuous whirl of several months the two of them stare blankly at each other in their barely furnished white-on-white apartment. The place has a nice view of the Thames but resembles nothing so much as a new hospital wing. The rejected Helena meanwhile sipping Scotch sherry and whatever else is handy as she goes about London falls under the sway of a fortune-teller who informs her that she is receiving enormous waves of positive energy. Not only that Helena will soon meet someone swell. Alfies and Helenas daffy all-too-human attempts at therapy and renewal establish the framework of stupid behavior and adultery that follows their unhappily married daughter Sally (Naomi Watts) delicately flirts with her married boss a debonair art-gallery owner named Greg (Antonio Banderas) while her surly husband Roy (Josh Brolin) once a promising novelist suffers the rejection of his new novel and starts an affair with a young woman (Freida Pinto) he sees in a window across the street. In this movie no one is satisfied with what he or she has; everyone attempts to get more and with one ironic exception winds up with less. In the past Allen made movies that echo Chekhov and Bergman and this is a pass at Balzac the world is ruled by egocentricity and meanness and much of what we do approaches grubby comedy. The picture moves swiftly and surely with people arguing seducing complaining separating reuniting. At times we seem to be watching the many limbs of a single organism all of them in continuous movement. Allen hasnt gathered together so many disgruntled people in years. Much of the writing is good and the acting is superb but the constant wrangling wore me out at times. I missed the physical beauty--the amber glow and the sweet sexiness--of ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona."" In this movie as in ""Match Point"" and ""Cassandras Dream"" a certain London sourness and irritability takes over. Crabby as ""Tall Dark Stranger"" is however its admirably staged and edited with several sequences that are breathtaking especially a prolonged shot in which Naomi Watts Josh Brolin and Gemma Jones tear at one another passing in and out of a living room their voices interwoven like the phrases of an agitated piece of music. The shot has the sustained intensity and the compositional intricacy of Robert Altmans best work. The men come off far worse than the women. In order to play the loutish Roy who becomes increasingly crass and duplicitous as the movie goes on Brolin sports what is possibly the worst haircut since Javier Bardems pageboy in ""No Country for Old Men."" Brolin with his bulky rectangular face and his hair both hanging over his forehead and standing straight up (youve got to see it to believe it) looks like a clumsy overgrown boy. He gives a brave performance as does Anthony Hopkins who has played tough men and monsters but never a woman-dazzled sap like Alfie. Hopkinss obvious intelligence makes Alfies last grasp at sexual happiness pitiable and touching--even a man this shrewd we think is capable of falling for a woman a third his age. As it turns out shrill dopey Charmaine isnt entirely cynical; shes rather sweet and the lanky Lucy Punch lets her big body collapse in dismay when Charmaine thinks that she has let Alfie down. Allen the moral rationalist cant help pointing out that there isnt any connection between virtue and happiness intelligence and satisfaction Wattss Sally the smartest and most decent of the characters constantly runs into trouble while her suggestible alcoholic mother floats through disasters like a butterfly in an earthquake. Jones one of the greats of the English stage and still a vibrant beauty gives the batty Helena a soft face and a rude directness that startles us with its aggression. In touch with spiritualisms promise of a future life she moves through this one with the maddening euphoria of those on whom nothing registers but their own happiness. Allen almost overuses Joness quivering brilliance. He brings her back again and again. He cant get over his bitter amazement that such a person as Helena could not only exist in a difficult world but swathed in idiocy flourish. ""Never Let Me Go"" an adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguros much loved 2005 novel is Im afraid a stiff. Alex Garland the English novelist who did the screenplay and Mark Romanek the American director are clearly trying for an analogue to Ishiguros celebrated poise--the calmly meditative style in which intimations of the sinister slowly but surely creep like hemlock into the readers imagination. Ishiguro in his gentle way gives you the willies. As in the book Kathy (Carey Mulligan) narrates. Shes a professional ""carer"" and it takes us a while to register what that means. She leads us into a long flashback set in her co-ed boarding school in the country Hailsham which seems a brusquely cheery place though slightly more constraining than other schools the children are isolated from the outside world; they all sing and applaud in perfect unison. It gradually becomes clear that the kids including Kathy are clones specially cultivated as perfect English youth (pale and beautiful) so that their vital organs after they have fully developed can be harvested one organ at a time to aid the elderly and the sick. Romanek has succeeded all too well in expunging from the movie the stylistic cliches of science-fiction and horror pictures. The light is subdued and even; the scenes play slowly and quietly and the staging is as realistic as possible. Initially the most powerful sign of strangeness is that such occasional emissaries from the outside world as delivery men avert their eyes from the special children. The quiet the flatness the gray everyday normality are exactly the point we are watching a routine state-sanctioned scientific procedure in which people are progressively eviscerated until they ""complete"" their service having been honorably terminated. Kathys job is to sympathetically shepherd to their graves her designated clients including her old school chums Ruth (Keira Knightley) and Tommy (Andrew Garfield) now fully grown. In the movies hundred and three minutes there are only a few outbursts (mainly from Knightley who plays a bitchy beauty with great skill). We are among the living dead. The movie is a zombie art picture. And nothing in it takes hold of us emotionally. In order to create this fantastic conceit the filmmakers drawing on Ishiguro have exploited the current scientific controversies but they avoid the usual moralizing the debates about bioethics. Those debates in this counterfactual world (the movie is set in the recent past) have apparently been settled. In ""Never Let Me Go"" the central issues are Are these kids human or not? Do they have souls? But the way that the pictures ground rules have been set up no one struggles against his fate sufficiently for us to get pulled into those questions. Its a rigged game from the beginning they are all programmed not to rebel. Perfect citizens they are hideously becalmed ciphers--metaphors of conformity and repression as in other Ishiguro works and certainly a striking image of how far we might go in order to continue living. But that last nightmare is not one that plays well on the screen in this super-refined distanced treatment. (It did play well in Stephen Frearss gruesomely realistic ""Dirty Pretty Things"" from 2002 in which illegal immigrants out of desperation sell organs to the ailing rich.) ""Never Let Me Go"" is in such good taste that we never feel any horror over the idea at the center of it. Much of the action is devoted to a conventional three-way love affair. The two women starting when they are schoolgirls are both taken with Tommy an awkward boy an outsider at the school. As the years go by and first one woman and then the other sleeps with him they all grasp at the hope that some nameless authority will defer their fate for a while. But the movie is so vague about how its world works that the love affairs (aided by Rachel Portmans overly insistent music) seem like the doomed romanticism of young people in many other movies. Its not all that different from the situation of say the preppy and the dying girl in the drivelling ""Love Story"" of almost forty years ago. You can easily draw banalities from ""Never Let Me Go"" about prizing every minute of life and appreciating your friends and so on but who needs science fiction for that?

""How do you explain school to higher intelligence?"" Elliott replies. He has a point. Secondary classrooms are what most of us dreamed of escaping from and the longer were out of high school the less receptive we become to high school comedies. Why then am I so pleased with ""Easy A""? Because the movie despite a few flaws seems to have been made by higher intelligence and because it catapults Emma Stone into a higher place reserved for American actors who can handle elevated language with casually dazzling aplomb. Watch a clip of ""Easy A"" featuring Emma Stone and Penn Badgley. Courtesy Sony/Screen Gems. She plays Olive Penderghast an Ojai Calif. high-school student who goes to class in a bustier emblazoned with the scarlet A of an adulteress. How she reaches this point is a convoluted story and a long way from the 1980s comedies of John Hughes; suffice it to say that Olive identifies intensely with Hester Prynne the outcast heroine of ""The Scarlet Letter."" A more immediate question is how Ms. Stone barely out of her own teens reached that higher place so quickly; the answer involves the twin mysteries of talent and growth. Three years ago she made a splashlet as Jules the alluring party girl in ""Superbad."" In last years stylish ""Zombieland"" she was sexy and confident as the larcenous Wichita. Neither of those performances though could have predicted her emergence as a full-fledged movie star. With her agile features Cognac voice and Spritely spirit she makes Olive an embodiment of young sophistication. ""Easy A"" was directed with fearless exuberance by Will Gluck from an elated and elating screenplay by Bert V. Royal. Like Amy Heckerlings ""Clueless"" which drew its inspiration from Jane Austens ""Emma"" this new film is an unrestrained riff on the Nathaniel Hawthorne novel. And like Ms. Heckerlings update the enterprise revels in quasiliterary language. In a preteen flashback Olive tries to reassure an anxious boy ""Dont worry Im not as smart as I think I am."" In fact shes delightfully smart and so is the movie; its bon mots are consistently bon. One of my favorites predates Olives notoriety ""Google Earth couldnt find me if I was dressed up as a 10-story building."" The other follows her emergence as a harlot--a faux-harlot more precisely ""I always thought pretending to lose my virginity would be a little more special. Judy Blume should have prepared me for that."" Olives pretense is the mainspring--or hair-trigger--of the plot. From the moment she tells a girlfriend about an imagined liaison with a nonexistent college student theres no calling back the instant messages or quelling the scandal. Among the things ""Easy A"" manages to be smart about is the madcap virulence of social networks and witty snippets of a webcast provide the narrative structure--theyre Olives effort to explain what she did as opposed to what she kept saying she did and why she did it. One interesting issue the production raises is whether kids will want to see it. I hope they do but it remains to be seen if the ""Im like and shes like"" and ""I go then he goes"" generation can handle the rich dialogue. Another is whether the movies look will militate against its success I accepted the indifferent cinematography as an almost certain sign of a low budget that didnt allow for careful setups or meticulous lighting. According to the story most high-school boys are either virgins or gay; that might prompt some challenges on empirical grounds. So might the unconditional support that Olive enjoys from her blissed-out parents. (Theyre played by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci and I cherished every preposterous moment they were on screen.) Still another issue flows from the unfortunate tradition of comedy let alone high-school comedy not always getting the respect it deserves. This one largely thanks to Ms. Stones role in it deserves more than respect ""Easy A"" earns adulation for originality hilarity and verve. ENLARGE Keira Knightley Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield in Never Let Me Go. Fox Searchlight Never Let Me Go For its delicate tone provocative themes impeccable craftsmanship and superb performances--by Carey Mulligan Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley--""Never Let Me Go"" earned my great admiration. I wish Id been affected in equal measure but I wasnt and its not the sort of film you can will yourself to enjoy even though you know that many others will be moved by its tale of romance class oppression and harsh destiny. More Mark Romanek on Videos Vs. Movies Carey Mulligan on Never Let Me Go Never Let Me Go Review Revue This adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguros novel was directed by Mark Romanek from a screenplay by Alex Garland. The book was an exceedingly slow reveal. Ever so gradually did it let the reader know that a key setting an English boarding school called Hailsham in the 1970s was part of an alternate sci-fi universe not unrelated to such classic dystopias as ""Soylent Green."" Ever so gradually did the schools ostensible students discover that they were carefully nurtured clones who would die after donating their organs to long-lived residents of an England they were barely aware of. See a clip of ""Never Let Me Go."" Based on the book by Kazuo Ishiguro ""Never Let Me Go"" stars Keira Knightley and rising British stars Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield. Courtesy Fox Searchlight. Im revealing these plot points here only because in recent interviews both the director and the novelist have approved of doing so. As they see it the potential for surprise has dwindled to nil since the book was published five years ago while a knowledge of the premise will enhance our appreciation of the characters plight and deepen our involvement in the intertwined subjects--what it means to be human and what inhumanities may be committed in the name of science. Theyre right on both counts. Its fascinating--or haunting if your mind can defer to your heart--to watch the trio at the center of the story work their way through love betrayal and reconciliation to a poignant peace with their fate. Ms. Mulligans performance in particular is a quiet triumph thanks to the dissonance between her characters dire circumstances and her gift for expressing wordless expectancy. Charlotte Rampling is chillingly effective as Hailshams stern headmistress and Sally Hawkins distinguishes herself in the small but pivotal role of a teacher who teaches kids the truth. If only the film had offered some relief from all that poignancy and resignation. Not comedy certainly nor even rebelliousness since thats ruled out by fidelity to the literary source but brighter sparks of life than the emotional spectrum contained. ""Never Let Me Go"" hardly allowed me a scintilla of hope. ENLARGE Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner in The Town. Warner Bros. Pictures The Town Ben Affleck works both sides of the camera to impressive effect in ""The Town"" a dramatic thriller that fulfills its considerable ambitions. As the director he showcases fine performances without indulging in showboating and illuminates character without losing a beat of the throbbing pace; this movie represents a big step forward from his solid directorial debut in ""Gone Baby Gone."" (The shrewd taut script was adapted by Peter Craig Mr. Affleck and Aaron Stockard from a novel by Chuck Hogan.) As the star he gives one of those fine performances though its an artistic toss-up between his intensity and Rebecca Halls lovely simplicity. The town of the title is Charlestown a blue-collar Boston neighborhood thats described by a wry opening title as having spawned more robbers of banks and armored trucks than any other place in the nation. Mr. Afflecks Doug MacRay robs banks. He and his crew usually rob them before business hours while their doors are open to receive money from armored trucks. When one robbery goes wrong they take the branch manager hostage--Ms. Halls Claire Keesey--and an unlikely yet engrossing relationship develops between her and Doug. Claire doesnt know who he is since he and the others wore masks and Doug doesnt know how to keep from falling in love with her. Watch a clip of ""The Town"" starring Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall. Courtesy Warner Bros. You cant blame him. Sweeping away the cliches of her character--the naivete the vulnerability the neediness--Ms. Hall creates a woman whose keen intelligence is exceeded only by her yearning for a new life with the man she has just met. (The intelligence of the writing is best exemplified by a pair of lines that turn on the phrase ""sunny day."") Doug wants a new life too but escaping his family history is more easily yearned for than achieved. That registers most powerfully during a brief prison visit with his father Stephen (Chris Cooper) whos not only behind bars but beyond reach in a permanent state of rage. More Jeremy Renner on Blake Lively and Boston Accents Romain Duris on Dirty Dancing with Johnny Depps partner As a thriller ""The Town"" has what it takes and then some an electrifying performance by Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"") as Dougs lethally volatile partner in crime; riveting work by Jon Hamm as a remorseless FBI agent; strong acting in supporting roles by Blake Lively and Pete Postlethwaite; percussive car chases through central Bostons narrow streets. And the romantic element though subordinate to the action rings equally true. When Doug says ""Ill see you in Florida kid"" you wont mistake him for a violent dreamer played by James Cagney but youll still root for him with as well as against your better judgment. Heartbreaker ""Heartbreaker"" in French with English subtitles is total fluff though its totality is reasonably agreeable and Pascal Chaumeils comedy cum scenery--mainly Monte Carlo--gives the mercurial Romain Duris a chance to show his chops as an homme fatal. He plays Alex a professional seducer who with two other members of a team thats supposed to parody Mission Impossible gets paid to break up bad relationships. (At least the people who pay him think theyre bad.) Vanessa Paradis is Juliette a headstrong playgirl in a relationship that doesnt seem to need breaking up. The movie can be arch and awfully strenuous especially when an obnoxious nymphomaniac named Sophie invades the premises. But heres a chance to measure its arch before the inevitable advent of an American remake. DVD FOCUS Juno (2007) ENLARGE If youve seen Ellen Page in this word feast written by Diablo Cody its impossible not to think of her when youre watching Emma Stone in ""Easy A."" Which movie is better? Which actress is quicker-lipped? Thats a moot point and an irrelevant one. The important thing is that these splendid comedies and their gifted stars deserve one anothers company. ""Im a legend"" says the pregnant Juno MacGuff wryly when her condition grows all too visible. But the film directed by Jason Reitman is not a cautionary tale. Its a comedy of crisp mordant wit and quietly radiating warmth. An Education (2009) ENLARGE Was it only last year that this tale of an English schoolgirls hard-won wisdom made Carey Mulligan an international star? She plays the precocious and perilously tender Jenny who at 16 finds the London of 1961--one year before Beatlemania--sedate if not downright sedative. Peter Sarsgaard is David a man of the world who offers her the prospect of an education that isnt covered by the syllabus of her private school. Alfred Molina is her father Jack as craven a social climber as John Cleeses Basil in ""Fawlty Towers."" Lone Scherfig directed from Nick Hornbys script. The Departed (2006) ENLARGE Martin Scorseses crime drama takes place within Bostons city limits but it seems to have been made in a state of exultation and holds you captive in a state of dark delight. The basic idea was inspired by ""Infernal Affairs"" a 2002 action thriller from Hong Kong and a classic of sorts. But ""The Departed"" has become a classic in its own right thanks in no small measure to William Monahans script and to a cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio Jack Nicholson Matt Damon Vera Farmiga Mark Wahlberg Ray Winstone Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. Michael Ballhaus did the cinematography.

(Bailey/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday September 17 2010 400 AM Title Never Let Me Go ""Students of Hailsham are special"" it is declared in Mark Romaneks ""Never Let Me Go"" a film more moving than most but not as devastating as it should be.Its best if you come to this story - adapted from Kazuo Ishiguros piercing novel - knowing as little as possible. So lets just say that the children who reside at Hailsham a British boarding school are indeed unusual and not at all to their advantage.They are being groomed for lives unlike others an ominous fate their headmistress (Charlotte Rampling) refuses to explain.The students do have their pleasures especially in friendships like the one between Kathy (Carey Mulligan) and Ruth (Keira Knightley). Their relationship is strained when Ruth begins dating Tommy (Andrew Garfield) the boy Kathy loves. But once the three leave for the outside world they realize that whatever their differences theyll always need each other.The film set in the late 20th century envisions a sci-fi nightmare in which humans have made life much easier for themselves - at great ethical expense. Romanek does an extraordinary job translating Ishiguros deliberate almost excruciating pace onto the big screen His images haunt us in much the same way the authors words do.Screenwriter Alex Garland also respects Ishiguros eerie understatement rejecting easy shock value for a deeper more horrifying calm. But hes cut too much explanation leaving gaps in logic. More frustrating is the superficial connection among the characters.Mulligans deceptively passive turn is heartwrenching and should earn her a second Oscar nomination. Knightleys beautiful Ruth however is missing a soul while Garfields unmemorable Tommy lacks any real chemistry with either woman.The films flaws keep us at a regrettable distance. Though there are painful moments and beautiful ones as well the end result feels more conceptual than real a tragic notion rather than a potential reality of unbearable sadness.

Adapted from the 2005 novel by Kazuo Ishiguro and directed by Mark Romanek (One Hour Photo) the movie (opening Sept. 15) isnt a period piece although it often feels like one. Its set in England from the late 70s through the mid-90s and its about three characters we meet as children who in the initial boarding-school scenes might be part of some dystopian Harry Potter triangle. Kathy first played by Izzy Meikle-Small (a real find) has a crush on Tommy (Charlie Rowe) who gets involved with Ruth (Ella Purnell) even though he secretly loves Kathy right back. Nothing too startling there except that the junior soap opera takes on a shiver of dread when fairly early on in the film (much earlier in fact than in the novel) Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins) the childrens third-year guardian reveals their true nature. (Spoiler alert If you dont want it revealed then please read no further.) Miss Lucy informs them that theyre designated organ donors -- children spawned as clones who have been raised so that when they reach their early 20s they must start to give up their vital organs for transplants a system that has effectively eradicated all human disease. It means theyre raised to be sacrificial lambs that their lives are destined to be over before theyve barely begun. This is a horrific scenario but the quiet poetry -- and to me the intense dramatic shortcoming -- of Never Let Me Go is that the characters all confront their fate with a kind of woebegone passivity. Once theyve grown up the roles are taken over by Carey Mulligan (sorrowfully beatific) Andrew Garfield (sorrowfully earnest) and Keira Knightley (sorrowfully peevish) and these three all act with a spooky haunted innocence that gets under your skin. Yet Never Let Me Go is a singularly odd movie because nothing really happens in it. No one protests or tries to escape or in fact does much of anything. The closest the film comes to a moment of lived-in urgency is the scene in which Kathy and Tommy chase down the rumor that their donor status will be ""deferred"" if they can prove theyre in love. That scene touched my heart yet too much of Never Let Me Go lowered my eyelids. Its a very tony fantasy of class oppression and fascist medical exploitation (themes that may speak louder in England) but its a lyrically inert movie.

ABOUT THE MOVIENever Let Me Go  (out of four)Stars Keira Knightley Carey Mulligan Andrew GarfieldDirector Mark RomanekDistributor Fox SearchlightRunning time 1 hour 44 minutesRating R for some sexuality and nudity Opens Wednesday in select cities By Scott Bowles USA TODAY Say this for Never Let Me Go It never does. Based on the grim novel by Kazuo Ishiguro Go doesnt embrace the books unrelentingly dark tones as much as it wallows in them. Our heroes are so subdued and our villains so invisible that its hard to muster much sympathy for this future world. (Warning This review contains a few spoilers.) TRAILER Take a peek at Never Let Me Go Set in pastoral England Go casts a world where all diseases have been cured and humans routinely live beyond 100. The catch? Children have to be cloned and harvested for body parts to keep mankind running. Its a chilling premise even if it does borrow from the 1976 sci-fi cult classic Logans Run in which humans are exterminated at 30 to keep the population under control. In that film at least Michael York and company ran for their lives. Here it seems our characters prefer to lament their lot rather than do something about it. While the movie doesnt stoop to synopsizing its source material we need some explanation why these kids arent in a car and on the lam. Told in flashbacks by Kathy (Carey Mulligan) Go centers on a young attendee of the mysterious boarding school Hailsham. Like her best friends Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley) Kathy is one of the children chosen to be a living donor. The children are essentially stripped of their vital organs until they die. The movie is in stride in its hospital scenes where children are harvested to ""completion."" One scene involving Knightley on an operating table is as chilling as the sterile bleak walls around her. But the movie darts from those scenes as soon as they get there leaving us with husks of people ruminating on love death and their role in the universe. Fine questions all but ones that need to be answered at least partly on-screen. More puzzling is why director Mark Romanek offers no real villain. We know that the government has become a killing machine. But like HAL in 2001 A Space Odyssey we need a face at which to hiss even if it is Big Brothers. Mulligan and Knightley do fine with what theyre given but the real find is Garfield the only actor permitted a range beyond sad to sullen. Its not enough to resuscitate the picture though. Just as its characters need a reason to live Go needs a reason for audiences to watch. Neither find much satisfaction.

Hoberman Children Sentenced to a Certain Fate in Never Let Me Go Wednesday September 15 2010 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 A very British clone warAlex Bailey A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Published five years ago Kazuo Ishiguros massively praised Never Let Me Go is set in an alternate universe where life has been extended and catastrophic illness eliminated thanks to an evolutionary advance namely the harvesting of vital organs from specially bred human clones. But thats backstory. Despite its lurid premise the novel is less sci-fi than oblique allegory complete with an extensive subtext on the purpose of artistic creation.Narrated by a tragic innocent brooding on the nature of childhood and a childs burgeoning awareness of death the book attacked tear ducts; the movie directed by Mark Romanek from Alex Garlands script does the same. Garland who conceived and co-produced the project has fashioned a smooth if unsubtle resolutely linear adaptation thats been enthusiastically endorsed by Ishiguro himself.Like the novel the movie derives considerable poignancy by pondering a childs naive interpretation of the monstrous status quo--in this case an exclusive boarding school evocatively known as Hailsham. As rich in rustic charm English tradition and magical thinking as the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Hailsham is equally unnatural. Euphemism is ubiquitous in this hermetic environment although religion particularly the notion of Christian sacrifice is conspicuously absent--or rather only present in the legends and fantasies that inform the childrens inner lives.The children are aware of what they are but perhaps out of psychic self-preservation have yet to understand their fate--but then what child does? As the movie is neither a thriller nor an expose everything is connected to and imbued with pathos by the viewers knowledge of the actual situation Some will be quick to notice the homogeneity of the student population and the tacit assumption of their good fortune to be there; others may note the absence of reference to the childrens parents (and that the teachers are referred to as their ""guardians""). Although apparent from the onset the circumstances are only clearly explained a half-hour in when the three principals--Kathy Ruth and Tommy--grow up into Carey Mulligan Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield having departed Hailsham for the college-age halfway house where they will wait until called upon to as it is said ""complete"" their destinies.Never Let Me Go is distinguished by a strong supporting cast (Charlotte Rampling Sally Hawkins Nathalie Richard) as well as a trio of child actors with an uncanny--given the context doubly uncanny--resemblance to their adult counterparts. Its the memory of these children that underscores the movies effectively grim final section which concerns the protagonists adulthood. Even more explicit than a briefly seen medical procedure is the scene in which Kathy and Tommy seek out their former guardians. The confrontation is heart-wrenching not least because Mulligan and Garfield react to the information theyre given which finally strips them of their childish illusions as if channeling their childhood selves.Given its cast and setting Never Let Me Go exemplifies the genteel cinema of ""quality."" Whether the movie knowingly deploys that mode as the novel intentionally used Kathys relentlessly prosaic narrative voice to normalize her situation is something else. Romanek is addicted to close-ups of the tremulous Mulligan and adding to the fastidiously over-tuned sensitivity theres a surfeit of solemn violins. The children of Hailsham appeal to our best instincts--and also our worst. Life feeds on life. While rugged individualists might feel a measure of contempt for the resignation with which they accept their fate others--depending on their political sympathies--are apt to analogize the children to exploited factory workers military conscripts humanoid replicants slaves or most alarmingly those fellow creatures we call livestock and whose capacity for feeling we necessarily deny. The ultimate cinematic expression of the last example would be Robert Bressons Au hasard Balthazar in which accidentally given a soul a donkey dies for our sins.Pervaded by a cosmic wistfulness the movie Never Let Me Go is melancholy where the novel is haunting. Although the existential sorrow of Kathys closing realization is all but spelled out on a Times Square marquee the silent haste with which the screening room emptied the night I saw the film suggests that conventional as it is the movie is not without a transgressive power. The surface blandness does not efface and might even amplify its disturbing qualities. Never Let Me Go is not a movie about death but more painfully about the consciousness of death. An end title would be superfluous. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

TWITTER TELLURIDE -- Mark Romaneks ""Never Let Me Go"" is definitely an art object but is it a work of art? Expertly acted impeccably photographed intelligently written even intermittently touching the film is also too parched and ponderous to connect with a large audience. Fox Searchlight is hoping for awards consideration for the adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguros acclaimed novel but this will depend on the reviews which are likely to be split between those who consider the film a bleak masterpiece and others who find it straining so mightily for aesthetic perfection that it fails to provide a gripping narrative. In any case the downbeat nature of the material will prove a challenge at the box office. Ishiguros tale centers on the relationship of three young people -- Kathy (Carey Mulligan) Tommy (Andrew Garfield) and Ruth (Keira Knightley). They have no last names because they are not ordinary people. Gradually we learn that they are scientific specimens created in the laboratory and raised in order to provide their organs to desperately ill patients. Ishiguros novel was praised for translating his typical moral and psychological concerns to a science fictional tale. ""Never"" is not set in the future but in a parallel universe where medical experimentation has been taking place without the knowledge of most ordinary people. The first problem with the movie is that it never completely lays out the logic of this parallel universe. The cloning process itself is shrouded in mystery. Screenwriter Alex Garland probably wanted us to share the limited knowledge of the characters but this idea could have been maintained while providing just a touch more crucial clarity for the audience. Another problem is that the theme of the dangers of medical experimentation is a rather tired mainstay of speculative fiction going back at least to ""Frankenstein"" one of the first horror stories to underscore the risks of tampering with Mother Nature. This theme is less startling than the filmmakers may realize which would be less of a problem if the message were not delivered in such a solemn portentous manner. What does save the film intermittently is the poignancy of the love story which is bolstered by the skill of the performances. The film opens at a boarding school where three excellent child actors -- Isobel Meikle-Small Ella Purnell and Charlie Rowe - embody the three protagonists and Charlotte Rampling and Sally Hawkins contribute vivid supporting turns as teachers. Even at this early stage a romantic triangle is brewing. Kathy and Tommy are drawn to each other but the manipulative Ruth interferes and tries to claim Tommy for herself. When the characters grow up the three stars perform impressively. Mulligan is luminous as the leader of the pack and Garfield plays his more simple-minded character with marvelous expressiveness. Knightley manages to create a three-dimensional villain. The most affecting theme of the film is the notion that even among these scientifically engineered creatures love provides meaning to their shortened existence. Mulligan and Garfield play their parts with such conviction that we get caught up in their doomed romance. The design of this familiar but slightly surreal universe is well rendered and some of the visual compositions are haunting. But the pacing is fearfully slow and the elliptical storytelling works against audience involvement. The issues of medical ethics are undeniably timely but dramatically the film rather like the beautiful Frankenstein monsters on display only comes alive in fits and starts.

Based on the acclaimed novel by ""The Remains of the Day"" scribe Kazuo Ishiguro ""Never Let Me Go"" is that rare find a fragile little four-leaf clover of a movie thats emotionally devastating yet all too easily trampled by cynics. Every carefully chosen gesture composition and note in this tragic love story seems engineered to wring tears as director Mark Romanek (""One Hour Photo"") gradually pulls back to reveal the full scope of his ambitious thought experiment. Literary pedigree and near-certain critical swell should give this Fox Searchlight release serious traction with adults if not those closer to the characters ages. Though technically a science-fiction story ""Never Let Me Go"" plays more like a polite Victorian romance all repressed feelings and unrequited yearning. Still conceived in the spirit of such future-minded parables as ""Children of Men"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"" Ishiguros premise -- about an alternate society in which a special class of test-tube children are raised for the sole purpose of donating their organs -- manipulates certain key variables in our world in order to arrive at some deeper truth. Whereas the book withheld what made its three central donor children unique until nearly halfway through screenwriter Alex Garland (""28 Days Later"") puts it right out in the open. Though the students of Hailsham boarding school are too young to understand it they are completely different from normal children preparing not for life but for the more utilitarian function of extending the lives of others (since the National Donor Program was instated in 1952 life expectancy has climbed to 100). Their stern headmistress Miss Emily (Charlotte Rampling) takes great care to shelter them from any awareness of their fates or the well-rounded lives of which theyre being deprived. Instead the kids grow up believing all sorts of rumors and superstitions from horrible stories of what happens to those who cross the school fence to a hazy rule granting Hailsham students a temporary reprieve from donations whenever they fall in love. Only idealistic new teacher Miss Lucy (Sally Hawkins) dares treat them honestly -- an indiscretion that promptly gets her dismissed but not before she has a chance to touch the lives of the three main characters. First seen in 1978 Kathy (a sensitive Isobel Meikle-Small) will grow up to be a ""carer"" (played by Carey Mulligan) helping others through their operations. Kathy demonstrates this quality early on attempting to comfort hot-headed Tommy after the other students pull a cruel prank on him. (Tommy is played by Charlie Rowe who lacks many of the half-formed childlike mannerisms Andrew Garfield later uncovers in the character.) Before Kathy and Tommys shy courtship can properly take hold her best friend Ruth (Ella Purnell a beautiful little back-stabber) makes a move keeping the two soulmates apart for the better part of their short lives. With Keira Knightley playing the elder Ruth (revisited at two more stages as the trio leave Hailsham seven years later and finally in the midst of her donations) ""Never Let Me Go"" provides a dramatic reversal of the actress earlier ""Atonement"" -- this time its Knightleys character who bears the guilt of ruining someone elses relationship. Most auds will have been weeping long before Ruth asks forgiveness such is the shameless sympathy-mongering tone Romanek embraces for the entire film. A series of mirthless gray halls Hailsham is no Hogwarts the costumes and furnishings more reminiscent of a 1930s juvenile detention center than of any institution operating during the late 70s. Romanek best known for his visionary musicvideo work tries to hold back anything that might brand the film as overly personal and yet as in ""One Hour Photo"" his gift for texture and tone shines through. Once again the helmer seems drawn to the melancholy side of his material directing the cast especially Mulligan to play everything as if teetering on the brink of a complete emotional breakdown. This extreme approach requires a level of commitment not only from the cast but from the audience as well asking us to look past huge plausibility holes (the whole donor system seems terribly inefficient) and instead dedicate our attention to deciphering the subtlest of nonverbal cues often aided by Rachel Portmans effectively grief-inducing score and Adam Kimmels lensing which transforms every image into a source for introspection. A few faint wisps of narration aside Mulligan does most of her work without dialogue relying on engaged auds to piece together what Kathy is thinking. Despite perpetrating a number of significant changes from the novel Garland really gets to the marrow of it raising philosophical questions about science and the soul that trace all the way back to Mary Shelleys ""Frankenstein."" With its ties to contemporary medical ethics as well ""Never Let Me Go"" is the type of film that invites discussion after the fact proving Romanek has more on his mind than simply making people cry.
