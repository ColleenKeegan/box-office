Universal Pictures From left Winona Ryder Jennifer Connelly Vince Vaughn and Kevin James in ""The Dilemma"" (Universal Pictures) High on my list of movie pet peeves is the hold-that-thought misunderstanding. Character A has urgent news for Character B who is too preoccupied to listen. So Character A endures a series of humiliations that could have been avoided if he had just blurted out the information.Its classic sitcom shtick and ""The Dilemma"" is a painful reminder that director Ron Howard was trained in television. Yet Howard has graduated to prestige films and even has an Oscar in his library so this guy-centric comedy contains an unusually high dose of feelings. The result is a fundamentally confused movie that is neither funny nor sincere enough to please fans of the people involved. Vince Vaughn and Kevin James are bachelor Ronny and married Nick respectively inseparable friends who co-own an auto engineering company in Chicago. While their company is wooing a Big Three manufacturer with a muscle-car ignition system Ronny is wooing beautiful chef Beth (Jennifer Connelly). But when he spots Nicks wife Geneva (Winona Ryder) canoodling in a botanical garden with a tattooed doofus named Zip (Channing Tatum) Ronny is knocked for a loop (into poisonous plants natch).Ronnys indecision about whether to squeal to clueless Nick and thus delay the engineering project is so phony and protracted we wish the Fonz would intervene. When Ronny finally takes matters into his clumsy hands and plays amateur detective were rewarded with some of the farcical fury at which Vaughn excels and Tatum makes an amusingly stupid foil.But instead of playing to the stars strengths the movie veers from soft-headed to soft-hearted. Connelly an Oscar winner herself justifies her presence in this schlock with a monologue about honesty and theres a pseudo-serious back story about Ronnys gambling addiction. Yet those elements belong in a different movie than the one in which Ryder is a conniving psycho and auto exec Queen Latifah declares she gets sexually aroused by exhaust pipes.Like its two main characters Howard and screenwriter Allan Loeb have tried to design a contraption that can generate both power and noise but they get it only half right.

Its a story about a man (Vince Vaughn) struggling with the suspicion that his best friend and business partners (Kevin James) wife (Winona Ryder) is cheating on him while he tries to keep his relationship with his own girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) from imploding. Its basically a chick flick for guys - a picture about emotions friendships loyalty and growth in which the men are the prime movers - which is a pretty novel approach for a mainstream studio picture. Any credit for this move however is outweighed by the films nervy tone and tedious politics it lacks faith in its story characters and audience.Its clear from the opening scene in which our two couples bask in mutual bliss that trouble is on the cards. Its less clear however whether well care. Vaughns character veers between smug and obsessive Jamess between tetchy and wet while the female characters are essentially devices (the patient paragon the wily deceiver) headed for their just deserts. The script offers more subtle observations on committed relationships but theyre decisively stifled. As if wary of suspicions that all this emotion stuff might be a bit well girly there are also laboured sports motifs awkward slapstick and punch-ups. The two lead characters day job is developing an electric car engine that sounds and feels like a gas guzzler and therefore is not gay. Its a shame this closeted movie is too embarrassed by its own tendencies to do them justice.

Those kinds of men-children are the heroes of Seth Rogenas The Green Hornet update and the clubfooted comedy The Dilemma which stars Vince Vaughn as a guy who discovers a secret about the wife of his best friend (Kevin James). And on the evidence the genre in which grown-up buddies wrestle with their masculinity while acting like juveniles is looking mighty limp. At least The Green Hornet is likable and a refreshing change from the heavy angst-ridden superhero pictures so beloved by obnoxious fanboys. The director is Michel Gondry who proved in The Science of Sleep to be a virtuoso at making childish fantasies take wing. And Im not the first to notice a Bob Hope-Bing Crosby road-movie vibe between the two stars Rogen as Britt Reid (a.k.a. the Green Hornet) and Jay Chou as the kung fu master Kato -- both smitten with Cameron Diaz in the Dorothy Lamour role. The thrust is Oedipal. Rogens Britt is a neer-do-well rich kid son of a disapproving media mogul (Tom Wilkinson) who in a prologue suddenly tears the head off his little sons superhero doll. Later when the dad drops dead from a bee sting Britt and Kato (who was his fathers assistant) knock the head off the old mans graveside statue. That marks the birth of the Green Hornet -- the self-styled criminal who fights criminals. Both for P.C. reasons and because Chou is a big star in the all-important Asian market Kato refuses to be Britts sidekick. So he and Rogen trade lame insults while fighting off bad guys chief among them Christoph Waltz as a Russian mobster. What a difference it makes when Quentin Tarantino isnt writing your lines. The Hope-Crosby thing might work better if the quips were fresh and Chou was comfortable with English. He speaks as if he learned it phonetically and unlike Bruce Lees Kato in the old TV show he talks a lot. His fighting -- heavily edited -- isnt especially enlivening either. Gondry who often uses sophisticated CGI to create a rough-hewn handmade look doesnt have a way with smash-and-bash car chases. There are a few neat trick shots in which Chou moves at a different speed than his slo-mo adversaries and a couple of good 3-D effects like the split screens in which each frame is at a different spatial level. But The Green Hornet doesnt seem worth the outrageous 3-D-glasses surcharge. In all senses theres little that jumps out at you. But its The Dilemma that really lays there. Vaughns Ronny and Jamess Nick are auto-industry vets looking to score a new contract and their big idea is practically a metaphor for the inner world of men-children. Explaining to executives that electric cars are ""totally gay"" Ronny proposes a responsible energy-efficient vehicle that makes loud vroom-vroom noises like those cool old Fords and Dodges. (At the risk of sounding ""gay"" I dont think we need more road noise in this world.) The movie turns on their women though. Longtime bachelor Ronny thinks hard about taking the commitment plunge with his dull girlfriend Beth (Jennifer Connelly) getting his cues from the happy marriage of Nick and Geneva (Winona Ryder). Then while practicing his proposal at an indoor nursery he spies Geneva smooching a heavily tattooed Channing Tatum. Should he tell his buddy and shatter him and maybe ruin the project on which everything in their lives rides? Or should he -- for now -- keep it a secret? His contortions moral and physical (lots of spying and tripping over things) occupy the next 90 minutes. Perhaps the late Blake Edwards could have found a balance between slapstick and psychodrama but Ron Howard cant get the pacing right and Allan Loebs script is even wordier than the one he wrote for Wall Street Money Never Sleeps. Vaughn has a couple of very funny scenes and Winona Ryder a good demonic glint but the movie cheats like mad The noisy engine on which so much of the plot hangs isnt affected one way or another by all the domestic chaos. The Dilemma comes down to whether Ronny can help the cuckolded Nick recover his masculine pride. This is symbolized by a scene in a pro-hockey arena in which cheered on by his bud Nick enters a contest to use his big stick to drive a puck into a small black hole. Even Dr. Freud would roll his eyes and tell the filmmakers to grow the hell up.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> The Dilemma amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << The Green Hornet No Strings Attached >> The Dilemma Kevin James and Vince Vaughn are college buddies and co-workers in a start-up that engineers engines they pray will be mass-produced by Detroit. Twenty years ago James married his undergrad sweetheart Winona Ryder while Vaughn set himself to carousing. All parties are now old enough that when Ryder says Vaughn has gone through every one of her single friends shes serious. The couple is Vaughns model of monogamy--he even uses the word ""hero""--so hes stricken when on the cusp of his own proposal to Jennifer Connolly he spies Ryder dry-humping Channing Tatum. To tell or not to tell is the question but more interesting is can you ever really know someone? That debate opens the flick and takes an interesting turn when Ryder defends herself against Vaughns quiet blackmail by whispering that he has no idea that James visits a massage parlor every week for a quick wank. Given the most attention however is the humiliation of the snooping sanctimonious Vaughn who is poxed with boils and bruises and even unmanned by Queen Latifah in a curious cameo as a car executive who thinks with her ""lady boner."" Its uncertain how director Ron Howard planned to meld sentiment and slapstick. That humor exists only in France a country that winks at adultery and Eastern Europe where comedies take it as a given that no matter what were all going to die. Yankee studio executives drive a wedge between the folly of existence and a punch to the nuts. Never the twain shall meet except in Jackass 3D. To balance the score The Dilemma ends with 20 minutes of apologies a round robin of regret that downshifts the films sputtering energy into park.

Thats a great story premise; its just not particularly built for laughs. But producer Brian Grazer and director Ron Howard are intent on keeping things light even in the depiction of pain. So they cast Kevin James (the rotund funny everyguy) as Nick the cuckolded husband and Vince Vaughn (the tall funning faux slickster) as Ronny the friend with the unenviable dilemma. They make Nick and Ronny business partners at an automotive engine design company as well as buddies developing a workplace subplot in which Queen Latifah gets to talk ballsy as a car consultant and the partners get to pump each other up with football analogies. (The gratuitous alienating business-pitch ""gay"" joke that stirred up controversy when the scene appeared in early trailers is still there being gratuitous and alienating.) Grazer and Howard let Vaughn loose to improvise in a lot of slapsticky motormouth scenes as Ronny spies on his friends wife while putting off his decision to tell or not to tell. Even the violence is slapsticky as Ronny confronts Zip (Channing Tatum) the buff tattooed younger guy whos been showing Nicks wife an illicit good time. But working from a story idea dreamed up by Grazer and a script by Allan Loeb (The Switch) the filmmakers just dont know what to do about the ladies. And the result is a hedging unresolved production built on an accretion of secrets and stuff that remains unsaid only in movies where the plot depends on delayed confrontation with reality. Nicks wife Geneva (played by Winona Ryder with coiled energy) appears at first to be an upbeat live wire who enjoys being with her husband (the couple are great together on the dance floor). Later when confronted by Ronny she becomes a lying manipulator who glares with glittering kohl-rimmed eyes. And Ronnys patient perfect girlfriend Beth (portrayed by Jennifer Connelly like a model out of a fantasy-toy catalog) adores her imperfect man but turns out when the plot calls for it to be hiding her own little stash of secrets. The real quandary in The Dilemma? Why must Ronny and Nick fight over women at all when really all they want to do is hang out together -- drinking beer watching hockey looking at each other with eyes that say I love you man while never having to talk about anything at all. The predicament is the movie has no honest answers for this guy-guy crisis. C+ See all of this weeks reviews Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 14 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Guy has best friend. Guy sees best friends wife making out with young hunk. Should guy tell best friend? Sorry but despite what you may have seen in the lame trailer thats not the real dilemma in The Dilemma. Nope the far more puzzling question is Since this emaciated premise is the entirety of the script where the hell is the movie? Movies The Dilemma The official trailer Celebrity The Wattage Meter How bright are these stars shining Not that director Ron Howard seems remotely worried by such a teensy absence. A brave fellow that Ron. So eager to make a comedy again he intrepidly ventures forth without the assist of anything funny and plunges headlong into the void. Helping him in the freefall is Vince Vaughn. That would be the guy with the dilemma. Now the guy has a girlfriend he loves. That would be Jennifer Connelly. But bromances being what they are he loves his best friend even more - Kevin James the chubby one with the unlikely yet ostensibly happy marriage to his slim wife. That would be Winona Ryder. Wait let me briefly press the pause button here to pose another puzzler Why in these early scenes and throughout does Howard light and shoot his two starring actresses so damned unflatteringly? All dark shadows and acute angles Winona in particular gets an especially rough ride from his cruel lens even though shes supposed to be all fetching and sexy. Dunno. Just asking. But its passing strange. Anyway much like a movie without a script I digress. And digress again to point out that Vince and Kevin are partners in a company that is pitching this bright idea to Chrysler an electric engine that in lieu of running quietly roars like a muscle car. Think of it as the Loud Green Movement. Alternatively it serves even better to describe every overhyped vehicle coming off the Hollywood assembly line - no gas but much noise. Back to the dilemma and the cheating Winonas aforementioned young hunk. That would be Zip. Yes Zip. Hes brawny lad with an impressive six-pack a mess of tattoos and an unaccountable tendency to break into tears at the drop of a backward-worn baseball hat. In short Zip looks like a muscle car but snivels like an electric motor. And thats about as funny as things get. Over to Vince who unwilling to break Kevins heart directly decides to confront Winona. Still looking bad but sounding quite reasonable Winona tells him ""You do not know what goes on behind the curtain of a marriage."" Whats more she adds that Kevin is a regular frequenter of tawdry massage parlours a revelation that appears to upset Vince a whole lot more than her. Hey bromances being what they are Vinces sharp pang of disappointment might have been worth pursuing but Ron Howard being who he is not a chance. Instead the plunge continues from one clumsily executed set-piece to another - here a big brawl there an anniversary party on to a PowerPoint presentation then a group intervention. At all of these stops spurred on by mounting evidence that the flick bypassed the script stage Vince is encouraged to improvise which erring on the side of generosity he does to self-indulgent excess. That isnt to say all of his adlibs fall short. Actually his best comes near the end ""I dont ever want to put you through anything like this ever again."" Such a kind promise but - and heres our last puzzler - can he possibly keep it?

Great question. In trying to answer the movie grapples hard with the thorny matter of honesty and relationships and trust. Everyone has secrets it suggests. No one can know someone else. All of us struggle to comprehend communicate and connect with The Other pretty heady stuff for a mainstream bromance. Despite bursts of hilarity this is a dark difficult weirdly existential film -- like some seriocomic spin on I and Thou. The Dilemmawas directed by Ron Howard (on a break from all that Dan Brown conspiracy-spinning) and written by Allan Loeb who shares the blame forWall Street Money Never Sleeps. Loeb also wroteThe Switch that one about the superseded semen. This time in a talky combative script he introduces us to two Chicago couples Ronny (Vince Vaughn) and his girlfriend Beth (Jennifer Connelly); and Nick (Kevin James) and his wife Geneva (Winona Ryder). Its Geneva who lobs that opening question and its Geneva whos secretly boinking Zip (Channing Tatum) a dim boy with plentiful tattoos and a lachrymose streak. Ronny spots the pair snogging between ferns in a botanical garden and from then on hes riddled with doubt. Should he tell Nick his wife is cheating on him or should he stuff it? If he tells him how will it affect Nicks work on the innovative engine (sounds like a muscle car works like a hybrid) theyve been busy pitching to Dodge? As Ronny obsesses over his cuckolded buddy he expresses his concern in increasingly inappropriate ways stalking breaking and entering voyeurism assault with a guitar. It doesnt take long to realize that Nicks problem isnt the story here at all. Ronnys is the story - and hes losing it fast. As he did in the even-more-painful The Break-Up Vaughn deploys his knack for high-grade Woody Allen nattering as a kind of verbal battering ram mercilessly pounding everyone into submission. Hes funny and more than a little scary but he also gets to show off his sensitive side He weeps he prays. Saline shows up elsewhere too most notably in a fake-crying diner demo that might be a twist on When Harry Met Sally. Ryder is terrific in this sequence brittle and unlikable in others; James is panicky from start to finish; Connelly as the only real grown-up in the picture glides through it all with mature detachment. None of the romantic couplings has much pizzazz The real chemistry in the movie and the only real relationship is between the two male leads. You could read Howards film as a suppressed homoerotic love story (complete with lame gay jokes) but there isnt anything sexual about it. The movies focus is that one sticky philosophical pickle played for anguish and laughs. Can we ever truly know someone? Can we even answer the question? Probably not but The Dilemma gets credit for trying. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Mini Portable Washer and Spin Dryer for 90 + free shipping Unisex Cushioned Arch Supports for 1 + free shipping Vizio 43"" 4K LED UHD Smart TV 150 Dell GC for 400 + free...

"The Dilemma review Yawn Not enough plot |       NJ.com comments The Dilemma review Yawn Not enough plot Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 14 2011 at 751 AM View/Post Comments Kevin James left and Vince Vaughn star in ""The Dilemma"" a comedy about a man who finds out that what you dont say to a friend is just as important as what you do say. The Dilemma"" is a movie about male bonding hockey cheating wives muscle cars comical fistfights football metaphors more comical fistfights bad table manners and lots of loud rock. If it had any more testosterone it could grow chest hair. Which is fine really. A good guys guy farce -- think ""The Hangover"" ""The Wedding Crashers"" or the immortal ""Animal House"" -- can be raw raunchy fun. But its hard to pull off. And ""The Dilemma"" proves that all over again. The movie stars crass clown Vince Vaughn as the CFO of an automotive engineering company with Barney Rubble double Kevin James as his lil buddy and star inventor. Except on the eve of their biggest presentation Vaughn finds out that James wife is running around. So here comes the titular problem Does he tell him? Its a good question to ponder but its not necessarily a great premise for a movie. Keeping a dark secret can generate tension in real life but on-screen its mostly just frustrating. Its not action its action deferred and thats a difficult thing to interest an audience in. The director here Ron Howard is also a peculiar choice. He began in offbeat comedy -- one of his early hits ""Night Shift"" featured an escort service run out of a morgue. And hes always been good -- ""The Paper"" ""Apollo 13"" ""Frost/Nixon"" even ""Parenthood"" -- with small groups working toward a common goal. But Howard doesnt seem to have control of the mood here. The story staggers from melodrama to farce. The performers styles are all over the place. The actors for example all go for straight comedy with Vaughn doing the aggressive charm/smarm thing hes been pretty much playing out since ""Swingers"" and James -- in an underwritten supporting part -- doing his usual doughy loser. How men who look like they just staggered away from an all-you-can-eat pancake breakfast are able to attract women who look like theyre on their way to a Vogue photo shoot is a puzzle perhaps best explained by self-regarding actors and sexist screenwriters. But more critically the two women here are in another movie and its no comedy. Jennifer Connelly cries her eyes out prettily as usual. Winona Ryder looks like 92 pounds of barbed wire -- sharp and skinny and dangerous. Its like shes making ""Black Swan II."" There are 21/2 good scenes in the movie all starring Vaughn -- the obligatory lets-fight-until-we-wreck-an-entire-apartment scene a celebratory toast gone wrong and part of an ill-advised ""intervention."" And as Ryders stud muffin Channing Tatum shows he has a sense of humor (which looking at his career he clearly needs). But 21/2 good scenes arent enough for more than an hour-and-a-half let alone a reason to dig your car out of the snow and go to the movies. Theres no ""Dilemma"" here at all -- just a simple disappointment. Ratings note The film contains sexual situations brief nudity strong language substance abuse and violence. The Dilemma (PG-13) Universal (108 min.) Directed by Ron Howard. With Vince Vaughn Kevin James Jennifer Connelly Winona Ryder. Now playing in New Jersey.

Yeah except this time hes alone on a bridge in Chicago in heavy pedestrian traffic. A mom steers her kid away from the strange man. Vaughn is playing his ""Swingers"" guy (does he ever play anyone else?) -- but 15 years on with a lot of years of hurt and bewildered and complicated laid on him. Hes not so money baby not anymore. Adulthood got him. The dilemma of Ronny (Vaughn) is whether to tell his best bud and business partner Nick (Kevin James) that Nicks wife Geneva (Winona Ryder) has been cheating on him. In launching a stealth intel op on her affair Ronny gets himself in absurd situations (like getting covered with welts after climbing through poisonous plants in a botanical garden) that trouble his patient-but-exasperated girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) who is also close friends with the other couple. PHOTOS VINCE VAUGHNS ON-SCREEN SIDEKICKS The movie is much like a really long beer commercial -- but a really dark one. Screenwriter Allan Loeb (who also wrote the underrated also not easily pigeonholed ""The Switch"") conjures a ""Delta House"" vision of a guy world. Even sophisticated female execs for major corporations (Queen Latifah plays a dealmaker at Chrysler who is interested in the boys plans for a muscle-car electric engine) say things like ""I got ladywood"" and aver that ""Deep Throat"" is a masterpiece. The girls are always playing pool and attending hockey games while wearing giant Chicago Blackhawks tops. Ronny gets away with saying ""Electric cars are totally gay"" at a meeting with Chrysler suits -- and no one is offended. No one even cringes when he clarifies that the intended meaning is not homosexual but dorky. Ronny and Nick banter like theyre hosting SportsCenter even at moments of huge career pressure. So far so Bud Light plus a PG-13 naughtiness. Director Ron Howard though isnt interested in doing just broad comedy and long passages go by in which he makes almost no plays for laughs as Ronny spars with his conscience. Even in the silliest scenes Ronnys obstacles are more or less plausible such as when he tries to take pictures of Geneva bonking her new boyfriend (Channing Tatum who is funny and weird) and winds up in a sloppy fight involving the desecration of sacred boy toys -- a guitar and a car. At the end of it Ronny is forced to change his shirt and try to look presentable at his girlfriends parents 40th anniversary dinner but this scene isnt played for a cheap sight gag -- bloody face amid the cocktail dresses. Instead Ronny gives a wobbly but darkly funny lecture about truth in relationships. The movie doesnt lead to any grand conclusions (or any conclusions at all) and the doughy James is not who Id pick to play an engineering savant. It is though Vaughns show and his twitchy stammering as he tries to talk his way out of the traps hes set for himself is sometimes sharply comic. He carries the movies secret message ""The Dilemma"" is not so much about what a world it might be if chicks (like the Latifah character) acted like dudes. Its more about the relentless chickification of dudes. Ronny really cares about his friend and wants to do the right thing -- but secrets of his own keep popping up too and Nicks marriage turns out to be more complex than hed guessed. Maybe he should stay clear of his friends personal life for his own sake. Yet hes helplessly sucked in a victim of his own girly empathy. Thirty years ago guys didnt hug unless it was a funeral or the end of the World Series. Ronny and Nick not only hug they dance with each other with more spirit than they do with their wives. There is much to say about the love that except in comedies dare not speak its name -- the kind between straight men. ""The Dilemma"" says enough of it to be interesting. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next The Posts awards page Read Next The Posts awards page Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46718 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21187 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17476 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

But Ronnys world is turned upside down when he inadvertently sees Geneva out with another man and makes it his mission to get answers. As the amateur investigation dissolves his world into comic mayhem he learns that Nick has a few secrets of his own. Now with the clock ticking and pressure mounting on the biggest presentation of their careers Ronny must decide how and when he will reveal the truth to his best friend. Starring Vince Vaughn Kevin James Jennifer Connelly Winona Ryder Channing Tatum Queen Latifah Director Ron Howard Running time 152 Release Opened Jan 14 2011  Editorial Review Need to know or let it go?By Stephanie MerryFriday January 14 2010Although the Judd Apatow brigade appears to have cornered the market on the bromance genre Jonah Hill was a mere middle-schooler and Paul Rudd was wooing Alicia Silverstone in ""Clueless"" when Vince Vaughn began honing his craft assuring Jon Favreau ""youre so money and you dont even know it."" Alas while Vaughn proves hes still got the fast-talking bravado that makes him so bewilderingly watchable neither his quick wit nor his chemistry with Kevin James can transform ""The Dilemma"" into the gold standard of buddy comedies. The titular conundrum arises when Ronny Valentine (Vaughn) discovers his best friends wife Geneva (Winona Ryder) canoodling with Zip played by Channing Tatum a muscular tattooed man-child whose sense of humor consists of air guitar and what can only be described as air humping. Whats Ronny to do tell his friend Nick or keep mum? Pelvic thrusts aside theres something potentially poignant here. Early in the movie Ronny says of Nick and Geneva ""when it comes to being a couple theyre my heroes."" The type of disillusionment that follows the all-too-common ""but they seemed so happy"" is both widespread and timely (think Al and Tipper Gore). And despite his soulless comedies like ""Dodgeball"" and ""Couples Retreat"" Vaughn is capable of balancing his showy brand of comedy with something more thoughtful (see ""Swingers"" above). But two things work against him the first of which is a cluttered plot that becomes increasingly outrageous. Ronny and Nick are also business partners and theyre under the gun working on a make-it-or-break-it presentation that could launch their careers; Ronny is considering proposing to his perfect girlfriend Beth (Jennifer Connelly); Geneva and Ronny have a history about which Nick is clueless. Did I mention that Ronny also has a gambling problem? And Nick is that fragile nervous type defined primarily by bleeding ulcers? True when it rains it pours but all these developments (and many more) get tiring after a while. Speaking of less being more Vaughn is the film equivalent of a well-known novelist that no longer gets a good edit. He has the charismatic salesguy shtick down but he needs a director who can rein him in and maybe Ron Howard nice guy that he appears to be isnt the man for the job. Vaughn has a tendency to veer into over-the-top territory - say when he confronts Zip screaming like a banshee or makes an unbelievable awkward and mean-spirited toast during Beths parents 40th anniversary party. You have to give Vaughn points for effort though. After playing the same role so many times he could probably just phone it in. He seems to work hard both at crafting funny dialogue and playing off his co-stars. And while none of that leads to anything beyond straightforward comedy at least its good for a laugh.Contains some violence language the irritating misuse of the word ""gay"" and an illicit sexual encounter that features a bare behind tattooed with a happy face.

Correct answer Do nothing. Dont break his concentration on his important work and let him and his wife work out their troubles. End of dilemma. But no this is just the beginning of the middle and the muddle of The Dilemma a bizarre experiment about the lies -- little and big white and darker -- that can tax any relationship. The presence of box-office magnets Vince Vaughn and Kevin James might prime their fans for wacky character comedy; the addition of Jennifer Connelly as Vaughns girlfriend and Winona Ryder as Jamess wife suggest a more ornery indie-minded drama. The movie tries to be both but it succeeds as neither. Director Ron Howard -- momentarily deferring his Oscar-aspirational films (Apollo 13 A Beautiful Mind Frost/Nixon) for a return to his social-comedy daysof the previous millennium (Gung Ho The Paper) -- cant find a coherent tone. In another movie age the question of whether to keep or reveal a toxic secret about a friends sex life would have been set in a sorority house or a beauty parlor; in the 1930s it was the plot motor for Clare Boothe Luces all-female play and film The Women. But in what I pray is the depleted end of the bromance cycle guys must also adhere to this exalted confusion of loyalty and gossip. At least thats the apparent theme of the script by Allan Loeb. He may be the current hot screenwriter -- his style is so versatile or his agent so persuasive that recent Loeb scripts have been made by Oliver Stone (last years Wall Street Money Never Sleeps) and Adam Sandler (next months Just Go With It) -- but all hes done here is stretch to feature length a sitcom notion that How I Met Your Mother could resolve in 22 minutes with higher levels of hilarity and moral purpose. Nick (James) is the creative whiz of a small engineering company and Ronny (Vaughn) its super-salesman -- think Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs from the early Apple days except these guys are around 40 and havent yet struck gold. Friends from college they are both involved with smart strong women Nick with his wife Geneva (Ryder) Ronny with definite bride material Beth (Connelly). The two men have dreamed up a way to add machismo to the environmentally sensible but in Ronnys phrase ""totally gay"" electric car by adding a motor that revs like a 66 Ford GT-350. Never mind that the same effect could be accomplished by stereo speakers with a vroom sound; this is their ticket to the stratosphere. Ronnys pitch mesmerizes one of the auto companies; a consultant (Queen Latifah) giddily tells him ""I wanna have sex with your words. I wanna bang your brains."" All Nick has to do is complete his research in a few days demonstrate the engine and close the sale. While Nick has his head under the hood Ronny plans his marriage proposal to Beth. But in the local Botanical Gardens he notices Geneva kissing an elaborately tattooed dude named Zip (Channing Tatum). Shocked and chagrined hes determined to tell Nick the awful news though it may unhinge his friend and scuttle the big deal. His attempts to prove the charges against Geneva are calamitous they lead him up a couple of trees and into the hospital. Ronny is also walking around with a few thousand dollars in cash (for an engagement ring) which worries Beth since her beau is a recovering gambleholic. Beth is involved in some subterfuge of her own. And Nicks innocent victimhood might be compromised by his patronage of a Vietnamese masseuse. O.K. a standard romantic-comedy imbroglio gets darker. Nothing wrong with that; Billy Wilder often led his characters into poisonous jungles of obsession virtually daring the viewer to keep sympathizing with a decent fellow as he slips toward derangement. Occasionally The Dilemma adjusts your mental remote-control apparatus from a wishful Fast Forward to a startled Pause with a plot U-turn (intervention counseling? huh?) or a weird emotional eruption -- as when Ronny shambles down city streets talking out loud to himself or God. But even these apostrophes are upstaged by repeated on-screen plugs for the the lingerie company Urban Fox. Thats a clear signal that the movie whatever its bold ambitions can be counted on to renounce risk for commerce. Midway through The Dilemma looks to be going instructively mad along with Ronny when he confronts Zip one evening in an argument that escalates from shouts to a fight to car-bashing and gun-waving. (In an accidental but creepy evocation of the Tucson massacre Zip tells Ronny ""Im only gonna pump three [bullets] in you like a calm gunman would."") Heres a good place for the movie to ratchet up from the domestic to the apocalyptic; but Howard directs the scene with feeble comedy tropes like Vaughn trying to shoot incriminating photos with his cameras lens cap on and ends with a screaming match on residential streets whose neighbors oblivious to the mayhem must have been drugged or on vacation. The Dilemma never stops being a movie and never starts being a good one. The film is so schizophrenic it suggests that Howard gave different signals to different actors. Vaughn and James who could pass for Mutt-and-Jeff brothers rattle through their dialogue as fast the anchors on Onion Sports Dome while the women dig earnestly for subtext that isnt there. Connelly seems especially tense when shes playing relaxed; and Ryder in a comeback role goes for broke in a scene where she has to counterfeit big aggrieved tears -- the veins stand out eerily on her forehead like bas-relief highways on a road map. Nor are the two sexes suited iconographically. Vaughn looks way over his normal fighting weight; Ryder and Connelly are rather severely under theirs. Only James -- the pudgy sitcom star whose endearing shtick is to under-react to disaster -- appears comfortable with the material. Then again given that he acquitted himself well in the otherwise negligible I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry and Paul Blart Mall Cop the definition of a failed comedy may be that Kevin James is the best thing in it. The Greeks defined a dilemma as a problem with two possibilities neither of them acceptable. Thats this Dilemma neither comedy nor drama neither bitter nor sweet neither inspiration nor satire or some inventive mix of the two. By the end an exasperated spectator will be wishing that Ronny and his friends -- and Ron Howard and Allan Loeb -- had done what good friends might do in real life and kept this secret to themselves.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Dilemma 1/2 (out of four)Stars Vince Vaughn Kevin James Winona Ryder Jennifer ConnellyDirector Ron HowardRating PG-13 for mature thematic elements involving sexual contentRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesDistributor Universal PicturesOpens Friday nationwide By Scott Bowles USA TODAY The Dilemma doesnt provide much of one for moviegoers. What happened here? The talent behind the movie by turns flashy and facile is indisputable Producer Brian Grazer director Ron Howard and star Jennifer Connelly all won Oscars for 2001s A Beautiful Mind. But Dilemma veers so wildly from bromance to drama its hard to tell whether Howard is making a comedy or taking an unflinching look at relationships. No matter. Neither approach works. The film opens with a question that begins many a cinematic dinner conversation and nary a real one How well do we know each other? Apparently not very because lifelong buddies Ronny (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Kevin James) see their worlds capsized when Ronny discovers that Nicks wife Geneva (a shrill Winona Ryder) is having an affair. The premise isnt bad and for a moment Ronnys debate over whether to tell his buddy is effective. Dilemma though loses steam as it jumbles scenes of physical comedy with those of real mental anguish. And its the serious side that undoes the film. Vaughns character for reasons that go unexplained becomes a chronic liar after seeing Genevas indiscretion deceiving his girlfriend (Connelly) and friends while he tries to ferret the truth. The movie finally comes off the rails when Geneva undergoes a personality shift thats downright creepy. Dilemma rests on the same structural foundation as episodes of Threes Company when Mr. Roper thought he heard shenanigans through the kitchen door. A simple conversation would clear things up. But that wouldnt support Dilemmas artificial humor which seems based in taking swipes. A well-publicized scene in which Vaughn uses the word ""gay"" as a synonym for ""dumb"" was excised from trailers but found its way back into the film an odd call for the normally family-friendly Howard. If Howard wants to know why the joke rankles he should try that scene with any other demographic. Dilemma tosses in a few Asian jokes to boot. Vaughn and James are likable enough and they would have real chemistry in say an all-out comedy. Here though its hard to take Vaughns staccato delivery seriously -- even when hes reciting a lesson the audience learned 10 minutes into the movie Honesty is the best policy. Too bad Dilemma didnt practice much of it. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

"Movie Review The Dilemma - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie Review The DilemmaVince Vaughn navigates an adult world under Ron Howards direction as the actors good-time character grows up.January 14 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic The dilemma for ""The Dilemma"" the new Vince Vaughn comedy is how to tackle some serious business seriously a telling your best friend that his wife is cheating a without losing the funny business of the glib good-time guy that has kept fans flocking to Vaughns films for years. Although the seriocomic mash-up in the hands of director Ron Howard is not without its issues this is a time when bait and switch is not a bad idea. Its not really about the laughs or even the drama. What ""The Dilemma"" ultimately does best is create a platform for Vaughn to drag that iconic character of his into full-blown adulthood. (No the inanely grating ""Couples Retreat"" doesnt count.) Grown-up is a good look on Vaughn. From the first scene its clear that screenwriter Allan Loeb (""Things We Lost in the Fire"" ""The Switch"") has created a far more adult world than were used to seeing Vaughn navigate. Rather than ""Old School"" issues like how many kegs does a frat party need or ""Wedding Crasher"" tips on cruising for quickies here the discussion over dinner leans toward the philosophical with the guys wearing suits and sampling the wine like they could actually tell if it was a decent vintage. The movie is set in white-collar Chicago a nice change from the more typical South-side grit with cinematographer Salvatore Totino ("" Frost/Nixon"" "" Cinderella Man"") making liberal use of the citys distinctive architecture and a lot of light to build a beautiful backdrop. The complications swirl around two close couples a Vaughns Ronny and his girlfriend and gourmet chef Beth ( Jennifer Connelly) and his best friend and business partner Nick ( Kevin James) and his wife Geneva ( Winona Ryder). The guys specialize in automotive design a high-end boutique business with Nick the engineering genius (far enough from the ""Paul Blart Mall Cop"" loveable dunces he usually does to feel fresh) and Ronny the marketing whiz with James and Vaughns sensibilities a good match. Theyre on the cusp of getting the break of a lifetime from a Motor City heavyweight and Ronny is just as close to proposing to Beth in hopes of building a long-term life that looks a lot like Nick and Genevas. The stakes and the tension couldnt be higher. But in a botanical garden as lovely and dangerous as Eden Ronnys notions about life and love are upended when he spots Geneva secretly smooching a tattooed hottie named Zip ( Channing Tatum). Just what to do about his discovery is unclear and most of the film is fueled by the comedy and the drama of Ronny figuring out how and when to tell Nick that his 20-year-marriage is apparently a sham. Now this is the tough part a for Ronny and the director whos returning to comedy after decades of more dramatic fare from critical highs that include ""Frost/Nixon"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" to the lows of ""The Da Vinci Code"" and its ""Angels amp; Demons"" follow. Drenched as it is in relationship issues the comedy in ""The Dilemma"" turns out to be a complicated beast requiring more layers than the sentimental romances of Howards early hits like ""Splash"" and ""Cocoon."" While he hits most of the darker notes the filmmaker proves too indulgent with the lighter riffs when a little restraint would have made for a better film. Most of the humor is of the slapstick sort as Ronny starts stalking Zip and Geneva to get incontrovertible proof of the affair. That basically involves an expensive camera a couple of fights a nasty rash a few felonies and the real possibility that Zip is a nut-job. The laughs get dicier on the business side as Ronny and Nick pitch the Detroit biggies their idea of a hybrid that melds muscle-car vroom with electric eco-sensibility. There were early protests about a punch line referring to electric cars as ""gay"" which after seeing the film seems code for ""girlie"" so maybe it was a flip of the coin on what constituency to risk offending. Meanwhile a few gratuitous blue lines that simply dont pay off chip away at the bankable charm of Queen Latifah as the exec overseeing their project. What the filmmakers do get right are the face-offs between Geneva and Ronny. Sometimes its just a knowing look across a crowded room but they turn wonderfully acerbic when theyre sparring nose to nose. Watching Geneva dismantle Ronnys righteous indignation a with Ryder wielding words like weapons and Vaughns body visibly absorbing each blow a becomes a turning point not just for the film but for the actor. Its as if everyone realizes in that moment just what is really on the line and everything resonates more deeply in its wake. There were hints of the more versatile actor Vaughn might become a few years ago in ""The Break Up"" opposite Jennifer Aniston. ""The Dilemma"" is yet another step in that direction and perhaps the end of an era as well. Now that the good-time guy has walked around in big boy shoes Im not sure theres any way of going back. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESBox office Low-budget The Purge expected to beat The...June 6 2013Review Kids pick up after adults in The PlayroomFebruary 7 2013Movie review Happy HappySeptember 16 2011Movie review HeartbreakerSeptember 10 2010Couples Retreat a popular destination; Paranormal...October 12 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentDilemmaCouples RetreatCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-the-dilemma-20110114,0,6293789.story",200,thedilemma16,thedilemma,latimes

(Universal/Everett) Joe Neumaier Thursday January 13 2011 338 PM Title The Dilemma A guy tries to tell his buddy his wife is cheating on him. With Vince Vaughn Kevin James. Director Ron Howard. (144). PG-13 Sexuality comic violence. At area theaters.It may be positioned as a comedy about infidelity but the real dilemma in the sadly unfunny ""The Dilemma"" is that several different movies are going on in director Ron Howards first nondrama in 11 years.Initially its a workplace satire about odd-couple business partners Ronny (Vince Vaughn) and Nick (Kevin James) hoping to pitch muscle cars with electric motors to automakers.Then it becomes a relationship farce about commitment-phobe Ronnys upcoming proposal to his girl Beth (Jennifer Connelly). Shes a successful chef and her parents upcoming anniversary celebration weighs on her embarrassingly childish 40-year-old boyfriend.Soon it morphs into a slapstick as Ronny sees Nicks shifty-eyed wife Geneva (Winona Ryder) two-timing him. This forces Ronny to fall off flower beds scramble up trees and get into clumsy fights with her tattooed paramour (Channing Tatum) to get photographic proof.Shoehorned in through all of this is a back story about Ronnys difficulties as a recovering gambling addict.That last thread explains why Ronnys friends worry about the wild stories he tells to explain his flustered state. But really Ronny is following Geneva and having a crisis of conscience Should he tell Nick what he knows?It reaches a boiling point when their revolutionary car is delivered to a high-powered manager at Dodge (Queen Latifah overacting in three scenes).This tonal mishmash cripples ""The Dilemma"" almost immediately though there are many other speed bumps including Vaughns irritating fast-talking prattle. It was welcome in ""Swingers"" ""Made"" and ""Wedding Crashers."" But here youre willing to give Ronny 20 if he would just ... stop ... talking.These are unexpected faults to find in a Ron Howard comedy. He is of course a veteran of classic TV shows and the director of ""Night Shift"" ""Splash"" and ""Parenthood"" -- all of which still satisfy.Since focusing on Da Vinci codes and dramas (1995s Oscar-robbed ""Apollo 13"" 2001s Oscar-winning ""A Beautiful Mind"" 2008s Oscar-nominated ""Frost/Nixon"") Howards put laughs on the back burner and this frantic movie seems designed to make up for it.Vaughn and James try to pump up the goofy camaraderie but the fraternal love in ""The Dilemma"" is more like wanna-be Adam Sandler (all that dumb clown-guy dancing) than would-be Neil Simon.ow could no one involved know this movie isnt funny?jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Its only January but its not too early to wonder whether 2011 will provide a movie as lousy and deluded as ""The Dilemma. A comedy that seems terrified to acknowledge its darker more sinister self its like an overmedicated patient or an addict in dread of relapse. Vince Vaughn plays Ronny a man recovering from a gambling problem. He discovers that Geneva (Winona Ryder) the wife of his best friend and business partner is having an affair. Ronny confronts her runs around Chicago spying on her but cant bring himself to tell Nick (Kevin James) the friend because the movie would last 20 minutes and require a new title.How about ""The Flintstones? Critics and audiences have observed that many movies look like TV shows and that certain television series tend to be better produced than some movies. ""The Dilemma truly does feel like a live-action extra-long variation on ""The Flintstones which ran for six years in the 1960s on ABC. Vaughn is built like a sequoia. James is stout. Alongside each other you notice how much Vaughn resembles Fred Flintstone and James looks like Barney Rubble (finally someone who looks physically right with Kevin James). Geneva makes a serviceable Betty and Jennifer Connelly as Ronnys girlfriend Beth is a particularly breathtaking Wilma.On ""The Flintstones ""The Dilemma would be a series of misunderstandings that some square but clever writing would straighten out. All four characters would have a big laugh at the end. As written by Allan Loeb ""The Dilemma doesnt sound like a film deep or complex enough for a director to lose his way. But Ron Howards GPS malfunctions anyway. He never decides on tones that complement each other and the dissonance is jarring. In one scene Vaughn and James are dancing with each other on the dance floor of a bar. In another Vaughn loses his temper and screams and spits on a residential sidewalk his eyes and neck attaining a steroidal bulge his voice breaking. Suddenly hes a wrestler on Total Nonstop Action. Is this a Fred Wilma should marry?Vaughn James Ryder and Connelly should also have a big laugh at the end. Well the men do but what theyre laughing about is actually whats wrong with the movie. Its whats wrong with most Hollywood movies about male friendships. Theyre unwittingly gay and not gay in the way that Vaughn in ""The Dilemma says that electric cars are gay. Theyre homosexual gay. Ronnys angst over Genevas affair appears more about his love for Nick. When Nick talks to Ronny James lowers his voice and stares deep into Vaughns eyes.Ronny and Nick design electric-car motors and are trying in a crass bit of product placement to get Chrysler to buy them. When Nick revs a car engine in the movies latter going he bites his lips and looks right at Ronny. Hes in heaven.Just before that they rough each other up after a moment of emotional honesty. Watching James punch Vaughn you might think about the moment in ""Brokeback Mountain in which Heath Ledger socks Jake Gyllenhaal once its clear their romantic summer is over. The violence is stranger here because we never see Nick talk to Geneva about feelings. He emotes only to Ronny.Connelly applies earnest joy and real ache to her scenes. Whatever movie she thinks shes making is the one Id rather watch. Ryder is cast in her harshest light yet. Its nice to have her back in the movies. But her return means adding to her string of risibly unflattering parts (""Star Trek ""Black Swan) best perhaps to think fondly of say ""Heathers and be done. Suggesting that the women these two play in ""The Dilemma should be called ""Wilma and ""Betty feels generous since ""Beard 1 and Beard 2 would work too.Elsewhere Vaughn tussles with Channing Tatum as Genevas lover (Tatums transformation into a sweaty-voiced Wahlbergian pseudo-thug is complete) and puts up with Queen Latifah rhapsodizing about the phallic arousal some car engines stir in her. Vaughn makes a show out of discomfort with sexually assertive women. He spent ""Wedding Crashers virtually crying rape at the hands of Isla Fisher.He seems happiest in the company of men. To that end one scene in ""The Dilemma"" is a spree of mixed messages. Ronny leaps onto the ice at a Blackhawks game and ecstatically slides on his knees toward Nick who in a separate shot is headed blissfully toward Ronny. Meanwhile poor Beth looks on from the stands a spectator forced to watch Fred and Barney have a gay old time.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

What distinguishes The Dilemma in this genre is its resounding unfunnyness its emotional dishonesty and the general unlikability of its cast of characters.Directed by Ron Howard and starring Vince Vaughn and Kevin James as best buds and business partners The Dilemma begins over a dinner between friends Ronny (Vaughn) and his longtime girlfriend Beth (Jennifer Connelly) and Nick (James) and his wife Geneva (Winona Ryder). Ronny and Beth are in awe of Nick and Genevas marriage their intimacy the sense that after many years their love still burns with intensity. But then a debate ensues How well can you really know someone? How honest are we? Can relationships really be built on trust?Answers Not well at all. Not very. Good luck.On a visit to a Chicago botanical garden where Ronny is mapping out his planned proposal to Beth he spies Geneva in a passionate snog with some guy who is not Nick. Ronny is crushed by what he sees and also thrown into a deep quandary. He and Nick are on the verge of a deal with Chrysler execs (the duo are developing a non-wimpy electric muscle car) and the pressure particularly for Nick (the creative side of the business) is enormous.And then everything explodes in a mess of misunderstanding mistrust deceit regret and rage. The intent is to wring laughter from the fallout but as written by Allan Loeb (the grim Things We Lost in the Fire the slick Wall Street Money Never Sleeps) and directed by Howard (not in his Oscar mode a la Frost/Nixon but in hack mode per The Da Vinci Code and Angels amp; Demons) the jokes are few and feeble.High point Ronnys inappropriate toast at Beths parents 40th anniversary celebration where he ""honors"" the couple for sticking it out as he imagines the illicit trysts and betrayals each must have committed over the years.Hes arrived late for the party and its the first time hes met his putative in-laws.On screen Vaughn combines a cutting caustic attitude with brute-force physicality - at his best he can hurl himself into the comic mayhem riffing wildly. Here however he simply comes off perplexed depressed. James who looks like Vaughns truncated doppelganger plays a neurotic Everyman shlub. Ryder (who camps it up madly in Black Swan) exudes hardness and hurt. And as a successful chef who becomes rightly concerned over her beaus recent worrisome behavior Connelly summons a few moments of genuine feeling.Unfortunately they belong in a John Cassavetes movie.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Four summers ago The Break-Up surprised many viewers by following through on its title forsaking the conventions of a breezy rom-com to detail the agonizing process of dissolving a relationship. Now its star Vince Vaughn returns with The Dilemma another Chicago-based comedy that lurches into straight-up psychodrama and the tonal instability keeps things lively even when the film seems intent on self-sabotage. Perhaps the shakiness comes from Vaughn a reckless improviser whose monologues can wend from sour and sarcastic to grudgingly heartfelt and pitiable; hes a man-child whose juvenile behavior can sometimes mask real vulnerability. Its rare for a director as reliably down-the-middle as Ron Howard to let his movies go too far out on a limb but The Dilemma is a wild ride thrilling when it isnt a calamity. Vaughn and Kevin James star as best friends and partners in an automobile-development outfit who win a bid from Dodge to produce a muscle-car engine for a hybrid vehicle. When Vaughn discovers that James wife of 20 years (Winona Ryder) is having an affair with a younger man (Channing Tatum) he finds himself in well a dilemma Does he tell his friend whose ulcer is already bleeding from job pressure or trust that Ryder will do the right thing and break the news herself? The longer he stalls the deeper a mess he makes of it endangering not only his friendship and career aspirations but also his relationship to his own girlfriend (Jennifer Connelly) whos flummoxed by his erratic behavior. The Dilemma asks some compelling questions about what goes into a longstanding marriage and whether theres some value in people keeping secrets from each other--so compelling in fact that its strangely jarring whenever it goes for laughs. The dynamic works out best for James whos more down-to-earth than Vaughn and more committed to playing a real character but Vaughns performance has an erratic train-wreck fascination that dominates the film. Whenever The Dilemma dips into melodrama for too long Howard suddenly shocks it back to comic life like a defibrillator with several scenes where the characters resort to fisticuffs and an epic anniversary toast that toes the line between funny and mortifying. It never coheres as well as it should but the film makes a fine mess.

Comments click to enlarge The Dilemma Recommended Video Rated PG-13  111 minutes  2011 A Chicago small business owner (Vince Vaughn) sweating a deadline for a big deal cant decide whether to tell his stressed-out partner and best friend (Kevin James) that the latters wife (Winona Ryder) is cheating on him. Under the direction of Ron Howard what promises to be a shitty comedy turns out to be neither shitty nor exactly a comedy such stock situations as Vaughn hiding on a balcony to snap photographs of the illicit lovers deliver few laughs but the ugly emotional mess is so respectfully handled that the story resonates far beyond its comic designs. Howard gets strong work from Vaughn and from Jennifer Connelly as his confused girfriend though Ryder steals the movie as the angry guilt-ridden wife.

"Dilemmas dilemma one of direction - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Dilemmas dilemma one of directionThe Dilemma a 2 starsJanuary 13 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticUnexpectedly sour ""The Dilemma"" barely qualifies as a comedy. Though it offers plenty of larky scenes such as Vince Vaughn and Kevin James man-dancing together at the Green Mill (the popular Chicago jazz club) or taking in a Blackhawks game its darker than any of the ads suggest. Audiences deserve the truth going into director Ron Howards film which is fundamentally misdirected -- or rather directed in a style to be named later -- and all over the place in a way Howards films rarely are. Its a Vaughn vehicle foremost and like the recent Adam Sandler hit ""Grown Ups"" ""The Dilemma"" allows the Vaughn character to treat everyone around him like an inferior species swan around with a smirk and get the last word in every sequence. Chicago is full of guys like Vaughn albeit shorter. You know sports-mad agreeably insensitive sweet-underneath lugs all wishing their Vince Vaughn patter will somehow end up charming the likes of Jennifer Aniston. Vaughns supremely confident overgrown-adolescent guyness is built on fast rude talk but the roles that cemented his fame allowed him to explore a softer sentimental side as well the side that helped turn ""Wedding Crashers"" into a hit with both sexes or save an bittersweet intriguing number like ""The Break-Up"" from flopdom. What ended up selling ""The Break-Up"" -- the unexpected pathos the scenes where Vaughns character ate crow and became a better person -- either will make or break his latest project which changes tone direction and personality every 20 minutes or so setting up a number of internal dilemmas having nothing to do with how (or whether) to tell your best friend his wife is stepping out. Vaughn and co-star Kevin James play Ronny and Nick best pals and business partners in a Chicago engine-design firm. Ronny is dating a chef ( Jennifer Connelly) who has seen Ronny through his gambling addiction and is cool were told because she wears a Cubs jersey. Nick insecure and ulcer-prone is married to live wire Geneva ( Winona Ryder who never needs much encouragement in the overacting live-wire direction) whom Vaughns character Ronny once slept with in college. By accident Ronny spies Geneva making out with an apparent paramour ( Channing Tatum playing somebody whos either an idiot psychotic a puppy dog or something else entirely; hard to say). What to do about it? Allan Loebs screenplay sets itself up as a farce but almost instantly begins collapsing into therapy. As Ronny wrestles with the decision to tell Nick about his wifes infidelity endangering their progress on a make-or-break engine design project Loebs script takes the easy way out demonizing Ryders character in such a way that an 11th-hour attempt at re-humanizing her does not work. The jokes when and where they can be found are puerile and continually give Vaughn the movie-star catbird seat. Loeb can write; I enjoyed a lot of his work on ""Things We Lost in the Fire"" ""Wall Street 2"" and even the unpopular rom-com ""The Switch."" Here in flashes you see the movie that should have been Vaughn handles a key wry moment (Ronnys ill-advised anniversary toast to his lovers parents) with the panache hes known for. Elsewhere though its hard even to track the intentions of a given scene and Howards indecisive pacing clarifies little. The movie was originally called ""Cheaters"" which hints at the storys notion that we all harbor secrets in a relationship some of them white lies some of them toxic. Its a fine starting point for a lively challenging commercial comedy. I hope someone makes it. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for mature thematic elements involving sexual content) Cast Vince Vaughn (Ronny); Kevin James (Nick); Jennifer Connelly (Beth); Winona Ryder (Geneva); Channing Tatum (Zip); Queen Latifah (Susan) Credits Directed by Ron Howard; written by Allan Loeb; produced by Brian Grazer.

"Dilemma The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dilemma-the ) Dilemma The (United States 2011) January 12 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Ron Howard is unquestionably an A-list director and his credentials are impeccable. When a filmmaker of Howards status has a movie tossed into theaters during garbage time (January/February or August) it results in raised eyebrows and generates a certain amount of skepticism about the quality of the production. In the case of The Dilemma Howards contribution to the so-called ""bromance"" sub-genre such skepticism is warranted. This dramatic comedy provides tepid drama and mediocre comedy stirred together into a stew so uneven in tone and texture that its likely to cause more than a few viewers indigestion. Among Howards infrequent misfires this is one of the most disappointing. Before proceeding with a catalogue of The Dilemmas faults however I must pause for a moment to give kudos to Vince Vaughn whose performance successfully twists and turns with the madly vacillating tone of the film. Hes outrageous when Howard wants him to be. Hes calm when thats required. And upon an occasion or two he provides the kind of sincere heartfelt portrayal one does not often associate with the actor who often goes over-the-top. Kevin James is better in the humorous scenes than the serious ones but he has nothing to be ashamed of. Jennifer Connelly doesnt have much to do but as window dressing shes a pleasant distraction. Winona Ryder continuing a comeback begun in Black Swan displays a bitchy edge. Ronny Valentine (Vaughn) and Nick Brannen (James) have been best buddies since college and are now business partners. Nick is married to longtime sweetheart Geneva (Ryder) while Ronny is pondering whether or not to pop the question to his girlfriend Beth (Connelly). Ronnys faith in the institution of wedlock is shaken when he learns that Nicks marriage isnt as perfect as he believed it to be. When he catches Geneva in a romantic clinch with the handsome vapid Zip (Channing Tatum) he is faced with a dilemma tell Nick and risk hurting his friends self-esteem or keep quiet and hope this is a one-time thing. Complicating matters is a business situation that has placed Nick is in a state of high anxiety over a major deadline and a loss of focus at this point could result in a meltdown. The situation becomes more convoluted when Ronny discovers that Nick is a frequent visitor to Asian ""massage parlors."" And when Ronny confronts Geneva she first promises to break it off with Zip then after failing to keep that promise she threatens to turn the tables on Ronny if he ""outs"" her. The Dilemma downshifts from slapstick to melodrama and back so abruptly that it is at times jarring. Many films have proven there are ways for light drama and dark comedy to co-exist but Howard has not used any of those as a template. The marriage of disparate elements in The Dilemma is awkward at best. To make matters worse some of the comedy simply isnt funny and a large chunk of the middle act which follows the misadventures of Ronny playing amateur private detective feels like padding. The movie is too long by at least 20 minutes; cut that much from the running time and The Dilemma might have been better streamlined. The movie contains at least one classic ""Vaughn moment"" - it comes during a toast to a couple who have been married for 40 years. Extolling the virtues of honesty Ronny embarks upon a long rambling monologue that turns into one of The Dilemmas few highlights. Its rude and biting and shows what the movie could have been if it had elected not to pull punches. The screenplay credited to Allan Loeb (who also wrote the underwhelming Wall Street Money Never Sleeps) arguably spends too much time on the nuts-and-bolts details of Ronny and Nicks deal with Chrysler Motors. Nicks design of a new engine gets more screen time than Queen Latifa whose dialogue is frankly embarrassing. That her crude comments are designed to get big laughs is a testimony to what some audiences find hilarious. One certain thing about this film is that theres no dilemma about whether or not to plunk down 10 to see it. Give it a pass and spend the money on something more deserving. This is after all awards season and the sharing of multiplex halls with Oscar contenders is more rarified company than The Dilemma deserves.

Namely is it a comedy with dark undertones or a serious film lightened by occasional bursts of laughter? The Dilemma Fair Director Ron Howard. Cast Vince Vaughn Kevin James Jennifer Connelly Winona Ryder. Rating PG-13 for sexual content. Guide to this weeks new movie releases Spotlight Vince Vaughn | Queen Latifah >> This weeks new movie releases Unfortunately director Ron Howard cant seem to make up his mind so the movie sputters ahead never feeling sure of itself. There are a few big laughs but there are also long stretches in which nothing funny happens. The films premise is full of potential. Single Ronny and married Nick are two middle-aged business partners who have been best pals since college. Ronny learns that Nicks wife is cheating Does he tell Nick upsetting him and possibly blowing a heaven-sent business opportunity? Vince Vaughn plays Ronny and hes full of the actors signature tics and motor-mouth charm. In fact that the movie sustains interest is largely because of Vaughns ability to be vaguely slimy yet likable at the same time. As Ronny ponders what to do the movie piles situation upon situation. Ronnys relationship with his girlfriend grows strained and the guys yawn-inducing business deal (involving an electric car design) adds additional stress to their friendship. The movies problems become harder to overlook as Ronny digs himself in deeper. The character is saddled with a gambling addiction an empty plot device that exists only because the movie needs an intervention sequence. Not funny. But then you get a classic Vaughn moment in which Ronny makes an inappropriate toast at a wedding and the bit is hilarious. It also feels like it belongs in another movie. Apart from Vaughn the rest of the cast is mostly wasted. Kevin James is vacant as Nick while Jennifer Connelly has even less to work with as Ronnys girlfriend. Only Winona Ryder as Nicks unfaithful spouse gets to have much fun mainly because she gets to be wonderfully evil during a confrontation with Vaughn. The movies uneven tone continues through the final moment It ends with a slapstick scene of jovial bro-hood that feels tacked-on and completely out of character from what has preceded it. ""The Dilemma"" is never dull but its also a mess. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

With or without the ""electric cars are gay"" joke that made its trailer a subject of controversy last fall ""The Dilemma"" is not a particularly funny movie. Indeed the true dilemma of this misguided seriocomedy lies in the filmmakers confusion as to whether theyre making a side-splitting bromance (nope) or an unsparing warts-and-all look at screwed-up relationships (sort of). Vince Vaughns reliable motor-mouth antics should appeal to a stream of mid-January laugh seekers but overall audience reaction looks to be as muddled as the picture itself; electric cars aside this Universal release is one strange hybrid. Lean fast-talking Ronny Valentine (Vaughn) and portly hard-working Nick Brennan (Kevin James) have been best buds since their college days which is evident from their similarly swaggering moves on the dance floor and the way they communicate primarily through guy-movie references and football metaphors. The two men are also business partners on the verge of putting their Chicago-based engine-design company on the map by landing an exclusive contract with Dodge. Ronny plans to propose to his girlfriend Beth (Jennifer Connelly) expecting theyll be as happy as Nick and his wife Geneva (Winona Ryder) -- a hope that turns sour when Ronny catches Geneva kissing a well-muscled stud with a lot of tattoos (Channing Tatum). Like any good friend Ronny wants to break the news to Nick but doesnt know how -- or when given this crucial phase of their business operation. And his attempts to confront Geneva with her infidelity are met with surprising defiance anger and self-justification on her part. Just when the film should be zeroing in on this to-tell-or-not-to-tell scenario it shifts gears and piles on a mass of distractingly soapy complications to the point where the quandary in question all but recedes into the background. Issues from Ronnys past including a long-buried gambling addiction conveniently rear their head driving a wedge between him and Beth and keeping Nick in the dark about whats really going on. Its one thing for Ronny to avoid the issue but too often ""The Dilemma"" seems to be doing the same straining viewer investment in either Nick and Genevas rocky marriage or Nick and Ronnys macho-tender buddy bond. Pic reps a comic breather for director Ron Howard after a decade-long string of prestige dramas and Dan Brown thrillers though the script by Allan Loeb (""Wall Street Money Never Sleeps"" ""Things We Lost in the Fire"") clearly harbors more serious aspirations with results that are significantly less funny than advertised yet also harder to dismiss out of hand. Not unlike Vaughns 2006 outing ""The Break-Up"" ""The Dilemma"" seeks to explore uncomfortable even off-putting relationship terrain under the guise of a mainstream crowd-pleaser albeit with no obligation to make its characters especially likable. But its a balance thats too tricky for Howard and his cast to sustain over the long haul and at 110 minutes its a long haul indeed; the stabs at seriousness deflate the comedy and the feeble yuks trivialize the drama. Memorable moments do emerge here and there Vaughn gets one doozy of a scene showcasing his peerless ability to shove his foot deeper and deeper into his mouth in ever more squirm-inducing increments and the pleasures of one shockingly violent setpiece in which Ronny brandishes a makeshift blowtorch at Tatums home-wrecker cant be entirely discounted. As Nick James brings little personality to a guy who seems alternately clueless and stressed out and Connelly though a shade looser and more spontaneous than usual seems stuck at an emotional remove from the action. That leaves Ryder as the only thesp capable of really holding the screen opposite Vaughn As written Geneva is the sort of nasty unrepentant tramp for whom the phrase ""bros before hos"" was invented but the script to its credit allows her to honestly voice her disappointment with the way her marriage has turned out. Its a problematic role to which Ryder (also getting down with her bad self in the recent ""Black Swan"") brings much more thorny emotion than it deserves. In a further sign of genre identity crisis Queen Latifah who generally can be counted on to brighten any screen is shoehorned into the story as an unfunny if overly gregarious Chrysler employee and someone seems to have gone out of their way to light her less flatteringly than the principal cast. Tech credits are rough overall; one shot intended to point up the disparity in height between the two male leads goes perhaps too far by cropping off the top of Vaughns head.

Daily Edition Login to download The Dilemma Film Review 400 PM PST 1/11/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A dark spirit pervades this Vince Vaughn/Kevin James buddy movie that stifles laughter. TWITTER There is nothing particularly funny about the scene that found its way into the trailer for Ron Howards ""The Dilemma"" last fall where the word ""gay"" was used as a pejorative. As it turns out this is all too typical of the movie itself whose makers seems oblivious to the fact theyre trying extra hard to find humor in things that just arent funny. Not that you cant make a comedy about marital dysfunction a cheating spouse dishonest best friend addictive personality and violent rage. But it better be very dark or edging into farce. The Dilemma is so tone deaf to its themes that it thinks its a light and slightly rude Vince Vaughn movie. Its not. Nevertheless The Dilemma is counting on -- indeed its only box-office hope lies in -- Vaughns mysterious alchemy with audiences that love to love him as an undeniable louse. Chalk one up for Vince if The Dilemma has any legs at all. Howard and writer Allan Loeb cook up a kind of buddy movie with a disturbing undertow. Ronny (Vaughn) and Nick (Kevin James) best friends since college form a motor engine design team. Ronny is the smarmy salesman -- he seals their deals with aggressive often inappropriate guy humor -- while Nick is the ""mad scientist"" who does the actual work. Theyve been best buds so long that Nick has never really examined the basic inequality in all this. But the crux of the matter the ""dilemma"" if you will is that Ronny discovers Nicks wife Geneva (Winona Ryder) is cheating on him like mad. But how does he break the news to his buddy especially when a make-or-break business presentation is already eating new holes in Nicks stomach lining? If youre in a Vince Vaughn movie Ronny will do everything wrong yet by the credit roll everyone will insist he did the right thing. What is interesting here if anything is at all is how Howard and Loeb sugarcoat the sheer nastiness that takes place. When Vaughn slinks around like a snake in the grass in an arboretum to spy on Ryder and her highly tattooed inamorato played by a luckless Channing Tatum he develops a huge physiological reaction to its many poisonous plants. Are you laughing yet? When he climbs an apartment building to snap photos of the adulterous couple he nearly forgets to take off the lens cap -- does that qualify as a joke any more? -- then gets into a vicious fight with the lover that borders on the psychotic on both sides. Dont guns and blowtorches tickle your funny bone? Throw in Vaughns gambling addiction there only for a lame plot point and you have a movie that raises serious issues only to trivialize them. At the point Vaughns character tries to initiate a spiritual barter agreement with God -- on a bus stop covered with product placement no less -- you want to page from the Great Beyond both Billy Wilder and Blake Edwards. Only they could make a comedy out of such dicey material. The movie strands several talented actresses who have nothing to do other than gape in disbelief at the male characters incomprehensible stupidity. Along with Ryder Jennifer Connelly as Vaughns unaware girlfriend and Queen Latifah in an unusually pointless roles as an automotive consultant must find avenues into a story that essentially uses them for plot devices. The film opens with a dinner scene where the buddies and their women actually discuss the movies topic which is Can you ever say you really know someone even your significant other? The movies final answer despite a forced feel-good ending is no your spouse or buddy is probably being dishonest with you in some fundamental way. But do Howard and Loeb even realize thats what theyre saying? Production values are slick but empty of purpose.
