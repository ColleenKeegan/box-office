Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Like anyone who goes to the movies regularly I had to make a choice about what to see this week. Faced with a screening of ""The Losers"" or ""The Back-up Plan"" -- Jennifer Lopezs comedy about good and awkward timing -- I picked the testosterone-ramped film about double-crossed CIA operatives who join forces with a sinewy mystery woman set on revenge. The selection may say that like many multiplex- goers Im drawn by (or inured to?) toss-off violence. Because its certainly not a J.Lo Jenny from the Block ""La Guitarra"" problem. Ive liked the hybrid singer-actor-producer for years. Nevertheless as an admirer of the screwball romance (and any comers that bottle that lightning) Id rather not tempt disappointment. And theres been so much of it recently ""The Bounty Hunter"" ""Valentines Day"" ""The Ugly Truth"" and so on. So here I am left pondering the weird charms of the latest -- since last week -- comic-book adaptation come to the big screen. And it comes with a plus Any film that uses Ram Jams ""Black Betty"" and later Journeys ""Dont Stop Believin "" to delirious effect automatically gets love. Based on a series by Andy Diggle and Jock ""The Losers"" stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Clay or ""the Colonel."" His betrayed team is an amiable collection of muscular and lethal gents named Rogue (Idris Elba) Pooch (Columbus Short) Cougar (Oscar Jaenada) and OK not so weird Jenson (Chris Evans). Zoe Saldana plays Aisha their dubious associate. For those who dont know what the pretty Saldana looks like from her turn as Neytiri in ""Avatar"" you will now. Theres a lot of the little lady here. She arrives tailing Clay around the dives of Bolivia wearing a revealing ensemble and a porkpie hat. Directed by Sylvain White ""The Losers"" is a silly jaunt. Take it too seriously and its probably a little specious about U.S. power too. There is plenty of good- guys-vs.-rotten-apple tension here. Before being set up Clay and company liberate a busload of cute kids and bikini-clad damsels. And make what you will of a characters wearing of an American flag lapel pin but ""The Losers"" doesnt require the full force of cultural critique. The action is a cacophonous mix of emptied ammo clips and clever quips penned by sometime director Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt. On the BSU meter (""Blow Stuff Up"") it rates an 8. Blast- zone radius and arching missiles get their due though the bomb the villain hankers for is an environmentally correct weapon of mass destruction. Its rated PG-13 because violence doesnt rate an R if the sexuality is ""sensuality"" the cursings kept to a minimum and there are explosions but no in-your-face bloodletting. Theres a smackdown between Clay and Aisha thats sure to evoke memories of Brangelinas throwdown in ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith."" Grunts grappling and the Kills song ""U.R.A Fever"" lead to a conflagration and an uneasy mission Get home. Get Max the mysterious CIA liaison that double- crossed Clay and his men. Jason Patrics baddie wears impeccably tailored suits and one glove. With that accessory and a sociopaths sly delivery Max gives off the faint whiff of a Bond villain. Its good to be bad very bad. And Patric has nasty fun playing dapper and despicable. ""Youre not sure how its going to end but youre pretty sure its going to make the papers"" says Max to snaky effect. And he doesnt even have the best lines. Those belong to Evans character. Consider Jenson the new ""IT"" guy -- as in cute information-technology fella. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedy denverpost.com. Also on blogs.denverpostcom/ madmoviegoer ""THE LOSERS.""

Probably but lets do so anyway. The Losers certainly looks and sounds like a summer movie a comic-book-based action movie full of spectacular explosions and cartoonish violence. In fact by its setup - a team of superbad military rogues is set up and left for dead by sinister forces within the American government - The Losers stands as a dress rehearsal for one of this summers presumptive tent-pole movies The A-Team. Movie Information The LosersRatingShowtimes | Official site and trailerDirector Sylvain WhiteActors Jeffrey Dean Morgan Zoe Saldana Jason Patric Chris Evans Idris Elba Columbus Short and Oscar JaenadaRun time 98 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (sequences of intense action and violence a scene of sensuality and language)Synopsis Just in time for A-Team comparisons an ""elite Special Forces unit"" is betrayed and left for dead only to come gunning back with a vengeance.More movies from GuideLive.comWhile it has all the earmarks of a cut-rate version (The C-Team?) The Losers instead proves to be a lot of fun and compensates for the mindlessness of its story by filling it with all kinds of clever playful stylish flourishes.Director Sylvain White quickly establishes his version of a cinematic comic book Scenes are color-drenched the fights and action are punctuated by slow motion and freeze frames and so on creating a world in which everything is heightened and stylized. Theres a gunfight in a hotel room in which a shattered mirror showers onto the floor and Whites camera zooms in on a single shard to show the crucial action in its reflection a nice addition to the pantheon of clever-cool movie moments.Where The A-Team will be brimming with A-list stars led by Liam Neeson The Losers team is made up appropriately of guys you probably cant name. Theres some comic-book-movie overlap That guy from The Fantastic Four (Chris Evans) is the techie-geeky jokester and the teams leader Clay is played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan who was ""the Comedian"" in Watchmen. And then theres the now-ubiquitous Zoe Saldana. In Avatar she was a blue-faced alien named Neytiri; here she is a mysterious operative in red-leather pants named Aisha. But the other Losers are so effective in this movie because you cant immediately rattle off the list of other movies youve seen them in. Idris Elba as Roque is the most familiar especially for fans of The Wire.Most fun of all is Jason Patric as the movies bad guy Max. He is supposed to be a Mr. Everywhere-Everything operative who is like a one-man Trilateral Commission. His latest plot involves some new-generation weapon a ""sonic de-materializer"" and his plan to start a war as some sort of anti-terrorist initiative. His plan makes about as much sense as the weapon (we watch an island disappear in a swirling swoosh like a toilet being flushed) but who cares? Patric plays Max as a bored CEO with a wicked sense of humor and deadpan delivery - as when he shoots his attendant for allowing a wind gust to disturb his umbrella.The real stars of this movie are the script and the screenwriters Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt. Its not just that their dialogue is full of clever lines and quips. Its that they use the humor to establish an attitude an aura that is genuinely edgy and fresh doing for pulpy action movies what The Hangover did for zany screwball comedies. At its best The Losers is silly smart and sharp all at the same time. Its at its best often enough to declare these losers (wheeze groan) a winner. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Movie review The Losers washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments The Losers Movie review The Losers ""The Losers"" motley crew is played by from left Idris Elba Chris Evans Jeffrey Dean Morgan Columbus Short and Oscar Jaenada. (Warner Bros. Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday April 23 2010 The first dumb-fun action movie of the summer season has arrived early with ""The Losers"" a loud loving homage to guns and testosterone based on a series of comic books about a renegade band of CIA operatives. How dumb is it? You might actually kill a few million brain cells just watching it. Some groups may even want to consider inviting a designated driver to sit in the lobby and eat popcorn till its over. This StoryThe Losers Humor salvages a would-be dudFind The Losers showtimesWatch the trailer What? You were expecting maybe Oscar bait? Not from a movie with characters named Cougar and Pooch (a man whose military specialty is identified on screen as ""transpo and special weps""). And not from a movie whose visual style was inspired by a comic-book illustrator who goes by the single name Jock. Its dumb adrenalized fun filled with flying knives broken glass fireballs guns and some kind of next-generation bomb called a ""sonic dematerializer"" also known as a ""snuke."" In the films one cheesy special effect a small island is shown being broken up by sound waves kind of like a giant kidney stone. (Come to think of it the whole cast should get a special Academy Award just for being able to say ""snuke"" while keeping a straight face.) The plot centers on a group of commandos led by Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan looking like Robert Downey Jr.s 1996 mug shot). Known as the Losers Clays team consists of his right-hand man Roque (Idris Elba); communications and tech wiz Jensen (Chris Evans); driver Pooch (Columbus Short) and sharpshooter Cougar (Oscar Jaenada). Betrayed and left for dead by their psychotic CIA handler Max (Jason Patric) they set out to get their revenge before Max can detonate a snuke in Los Angeles as a ploy to justify a U.S. military crackdown on terrorism. Aiding them in their mission -- or is she? -- is a mysterious femme fatale (Zoe Saldana). Along the way expect a couple of easily spotted plot twists not to mention the Losers Teflon-like ability to wade into a hailstorm of bullets without body armor and keep on fighting. Truth be told a couple of them do get shot but the occasional flesh wound hardly seems to slow them down -- or dampen their wisecracking sense of humor. That humor in the end is what saves ""The Losers"" from itself. No one -- least of all director Sylvain White and writers Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt working from comic book creator Andy Diggles source material -- takes any of this very seriously. From Poochs automotive mascot a bobblehead chihuahua named Mojito to Jensens rotating wardrobe of silly T-shirts ""The Losers"" has a surprisingly light -- and winning -- touch.  PG-13. At area theaters. Contains bone-crunching violence and explosions obscenity and sensuality. 98 minutes. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Humor salvages a would-be dud Find The Losers showtimes Watch the trailer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/22/AR2010042202254.html,200,thelosers4,thelosers,washingtonpost

Base unit this is Pen Man. I got Bravo Uniform Lima Lima Charlie Romeo Alpha Papa in my sights permission to engage? Roger. Wilco. Lets party. ""The Losers"" are a squad of military experts direct from Dumb Ops who while taking out a drug lord discover that instead theyve been targeted for elimination by their never-seen boss Max. Assumed dead after the raid this dirty not-quite-half-dozen swears revenge on Max. The movie based on a comic book features a couple of actors who deserve better (Jeffrey Dean Morgan Idris Elba) and some who deserve even worse (like Chris Evans). Morgan Elba and Evans play team leader Clay knife-wielding Roque and systems geek Jensen. Theyre three sweaty stalwarts who join fellow team members Pooch and Cougar (theres a 1987 buddy-movie title for you). The mission to drop idiotic one-liners and blow up stuff so unconvincingly that the characters often look like theyre walking in front of drive-in-size screens upon which the digital artists have scribbled orange detonation clouds. The movie is coy about shielding the face of the treacherous Max gradually building up to the moment when it can at last reveal the familiar features of . . . Jason Patric? Even when Patric was a star he wasnt a star. Patrics Max has a vague plan to destroy the world and/or collect 1 billion or roughly the amount of money Patric would need to spend on acting lessons to have a hope of resurrecting his career. Zoe Saldana plays a femme banale who joins forces with Clays crew. After picking up Clay in a bar in Bolivia they almost kill each other in a fight that concludes when a brief chat reveals theyre actually both sworn to kill Max. So never mind. Shes got a history of bad trouble. ""Pretty much everyone with the exception of PETA wants this chick amscrayed"" we hear. Pig Latin Whats next? Knock-knock jokes? Other classic lines include ""Thats right bitches -- I got a crossbow"" and ""Lets just say . . . hes a bad man."" Clay (who appears to own only one suit) stands perfectly still on a runway between two speeding assassins -- because I guess he knows hes a character in a movie and needs to look cool. A scary world-domination firm (""Goliath"") is so loose with its secrets that anyone dressed like an I.T. guy can stroll into an unlocked office and download top-secret data. Guys who are outnumbered and handcuffed can easily overpower their armed captors -- because the villains are easily distracted. Even the superweapons -- ""snooks""? -- are like the dialogue silly without being funny. Theyre green bombs that delicately implode large areas without pollution. Lots of carbon-emitting life forms wiped out and zero emissions? Maybe Max is an underappreciated Savior. This movie -- G.I. Joke The D-Team -- tries to do so little and yet falls so short. A clue comes when the girl asks Clay ""Hows your steak?"" and he replies ""Meaty."" Simple enough to achieve in theory but this would-be treat for cinematic carnivores is a sawdust sandwich. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Comedy Central censors South Park episode after Muslim t...

Pictures. Review The Losers lives up to its title 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Losers Action comedy-drama. Starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan Zoe Saldana and Jason Patric. Directed by Sylvain White. (PG-13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its strange what a bad action movie takes seriously and doesnt take seriously. Take for example ""The Losers"" in which cliches are sacred and human life of no value. The six heroes line up and walk toward the camera in slow motion ready to kill everybody as heavy-metal music plays. Youve seen this shot many times before but director Sylvain White offers it up either as something new (as if he just got the idea) or perhaps as a tribute to a timeless classic. In either case no irony intended here. Yet scores of people getting killed a young woman getting shot in the face - those sorts of things are presented either as matters of no concern or as punch lines. And so it goes on and on like that for 98 minutes. ""The Losers"" is boring. Its predictable. Its so so active and yet so so dead. The camera keeps on shaking and moving and the cuts come every second or two because if the image ever settled on something the audience might realize that theres nothing there at all just absence No characters. No wit. No heart. No sense. No thought. No talent. The movie begins in merrier times. A CIA black-ops team is in Bolivia when they get the call to blow up a big-time drug trader. They get happy and were supposed to get happy for them. As some voice screeches over thundering guitar chords on the soundtrack they prepare to incinerate a village enclave. And they approach their task with all the enthusiasm and sober reflection of a moron with a blowtorch. But then oh no theyre double-crossed. An evil rogue CIA agent named Max (Jason Patric) blows up their helicopter and now the merry band of five is stuck in Bolivia and presumed dead. For the rest of the movie the guys are planning how to return to the United States and kill Max. They plan this with the help of a dangerous woman of mystery played by Zoe Saldana. That in itself tells you something about the intended audience for this movie. Saldana looks about as dangerous as training wheels and only a child could see her as a woman of mystery and intrigue. In one scene she gets into a full-out brawl with the black-ops leader (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and fights the big guy to a draw. Its unintentionally funny but also reminiscent of the way little boys and girls will sometimes fight and then become friends. Indeed if youre ever stuck watching this movie one way to get through the experience is to imagine that every character is 8 years old. Then ""The Losers"" comes into focus. Patric as the villain is really just an evil boy only instead of pulling the wings off flies hes obtaining weapons of mass destruction in order to pull the wings off civilization. But he has no moral sense no true comprehension of the consequences. And neither really do the good guys - the so-called Losers - who just like to hang out in their pretend fort and build fires and who feel threatened when the local tomboy starts hanging out with them. ""The Losers"" presents characters stunted at a sort of pre-moral stage of life and offers them up as an ideal. The jokes are there to cover it and the pretend sex is there to throw you off the scent. But all the same its weird that few people will notice this - or see it as an expression of something sick. -- Advisory Nonstop violence multiple deaths a knife to a childs throat and sexual situations.

"The Losers Just A Team wannabes | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Losers Just A Team wannabesThe Losers try to copy The A-Team. with little success.Zoe Saldana and Jeffrey Dean Morgan tussel in The Losers  (JOHN BRAMLEY PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 22 2010The Losers (out of 4)Starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan Zoe Saldana Jason Patric Idris Elba and Chris Evans. Directed by Sylvain White. At major theatres. 98 minutes. The A-Team isnt in theatres for another seven weeks and already the copycats are taking it on. The Losers looks as though it was shot in a hurry on the basis of information gleaned from The A-Team trailer (or the 1980s TV series that spawned it) with lookalike cast members and the same towel-snapping masochism.Article Continued BelowThis may be the dawn of a whole new genre of exploitation cinema the pre-emptive rip-off.The Losers at least has speed on its side -- not to mention a bad case of ADD and camera jitters -- but all compliments end there.Whatever it is that France-born director Sylvain White (Stomp the Yard) and his conscripts are engaged in its not coherent storytelling. This is a movie for people who would really rather be playing a video game -- one with lots of bullets.Or reading a comic book which is in fact the source of this eruption. Screenwriters Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt adapt from the comic-book series of the same name and its unlikely they needed more than the back of a cigarette box to pen all the dialogue.Its the oh-so-familiar story of Special Forces soldiers who get set up get mad and then decide to get even. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is Clay still in wise-cracking and skull-splitting Comedian mode from Watchmen who commands a crack team of buff bastards named Roque (Idris Elba) Jensen (Chris Evans) Pooch (Columbus Short) and Cougar (Oscar Jaenada). We meet them as theyre trying to get er done in the jungles of Bolivia taking out a guy whom the CIA doesnt like. A group of wayward school kids get in the way -- man did that field trip go wrong So does a capitalist sociopath named Max (Jason Patric) who is so infantile he probably considers the kids to be competition. Max calmly murders any flunky who disappoints him which is often.While plotting payback against Max Clay goes for a drink and meets a sexy distraction named Aisha (Zoe Saldana) a woman who seems to have more than just boot-knocking on her mind. These two dont just strike sparks together they burn down the hotel. Clay mutters that he has a habit of getting involved with ""volatile"" women like the ex-girlfriend who once left a bomb in his car.You may well be asking where this is going. Excellent question for which there is no simple answer. Clay and his mates spend a great deal of time rounding up heavy artillery and stealing computer files in absurd and violent ways as they plot to get back at Max whom Patric delights in portraying in all his pinky-sucking glory. Hes so over-the-top he cant even see the bottom. Max would be funny if he werent so sickeningly brutal racist and vile.There are many shootouts and explosions at all points from Miami to Mumbai. But there are also many miraculous escapes -- like the character who gets shot in both legs yet still manages to rappel up a building shortly thereafter.Rather than try to figure it all out viewers may find more entertainment in matching characters The Losers has scalped from the coming The A-Team.Morgan is the gruffly determined Col. John ""Hannibal"" Smith; Elba is headstrong brute Sgt. Bosco ""B.A."" Baracus; Short is fearless transporter Capt. ""Howling Mad"" Murdock; Evans is a hacker version of the resourceful Lt. Templeton ""Faceman"" Peck; and so on.

Warner Bros. By John Anderson Updated April 23 2010 1201 a.m. ET Our culture tends to take good ideas and push them to embarrassing excess. Jay Leno five nights a week. Three Jonas brothers. Chocolate-chip granola. And then every once in a while you get something truly ridiculous like ""The Losers"" from Warner Brothers. An aptly titled grossly overdone big-screen adaptation of a DC Comics publication it is as though we needed it another symptom of where were going cinematically and a movie that takes bilious joy in its own soullessness. In addition to all else and its a lot ""The Losers"" wastes the riches of Hollywood technology in hot pursuit of nothing. Nothing you say? Nothing but profits but thats strictly Hollywoods concern. Producer Joel Silver has a record of knowing where audiences live and what they want but we dont have to be accomplices. Especially since the folks behind ""The Losers"" among them director Sylvain White (""Stomp the Yard"") are making only a halfhearted effort to separate us from our money. They should work a little harder. The film certainly provides stimuli--in its first 10 minutes we get our title gang of renegade heroes evil Bolivian drug lords and their drug-mule children a smoking school bus girls in bikinis enough high-caliber firepower to light up La Paz an exploding helicopter poignancy death a thirst for revenge. And a burning teddy bear. All served up with the freshness of last weeks salad bar. Watch a scene from ""The Losers"" a new comic-book adaptation starring Stringer Bell himself Idris Elba. Courtesy Warner Bros. Overkill indeed. But does this make ""The Losers"" a bad movie? Yes. It does. In the films exploitation of every action-movie convention hatched since Sylvester Stallone was a yoot the objective is to distract not engage; theres neither a sliver of emotional substance here nor any attempt to find one. The waste is bothersome even senseless If their target audiences were as brain-dead as the filmmakers seem to think they would be just as enchanted by any shiny object being waved in front of their faces. So why bother to make a major motion picture when all the studio really wants is the footage to make the trailer that will get people into the theaters on Friday or Saturday night? Lets cut to the chase ""The Losers"" is a videogame writ large and thats where studio films are blithely headed. (See ""Avatar"" if only for an example of how visual machismo is trumping narrative.) Zoe Saldana who happens to have been the woman behind the lanky blue heroine of ""Avatar"" plays the female foil to the Losers who are presumed dead by the U.S. government after their helicopter full of kids is shot down. Ms. Saldanas Aisha is a high-kicking and rather lethal femme fatale with naturally a hidden agenda who becomes romantically involved with the Losers leader Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) for reasons known only to herself and the casting director. Mr. Morgan of ""Greys Anatomy"" was last seen in theaters in another comic-book knockoff ""Watchmen"" and is a vocal doppelganger for George Clooney. Hes also a kind of heavier sweatier version of Mr. Clooney physically. Which suggests the filmmakers really wanted Mr. Clooney and that Mr. Morgan is a kind of avatar himself. Speaking of Mr. Clooney theres an ""Oceans Eleven""-style influence on ""The Losers"" in which each macho member of the team is a specialist in some form of con game or death-dealing and much screen time is devoted to wisecracking which would be nice except that the dialogue is so tone deaf that English might have been the screenwriters second language. This is particularly regrettable as regards Jason Patrics role as the malevolent Max a mysterious master of war who was responsible for the death of those drug-mule kids. Mr. Patric is perfectly odious but hes also supposed to be funny and hes not because the script by Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt gives him nothing funny to do or say. Yes a particularly nimble comedian might have dredged some mirth out of the mire but no one on hand is so gifted; certainly not Idris Elba who plays the fearsome Roque or Columbus Short who plays Pooch or Lord knows Ms. Saldana. The action film as quasicomedy goes back to the Schwarzenegger era but at least Ahnuld had a few goofy lines. Despite the valiant efforts of Chris Evans whose character Jensen is the hustler/clown of the group ""The Losers"" provides barely a giggle. A laugh wouldnt have saved anything but it wouldnt have hurt. ENLARGE Emma Stone and Jeff Daniels in Paper Man. MPI Media Group Paper Man Quirky. Wacky. Offbeat. Outre. The words that come to mind regarding ""Paper Man"" might prompt you run in the opposite direction. And perhaps you should except for the performances of Jeff Daniels and Emma Stone. As the lonely writer and the teenager who salvages him the veteran actor and the yet-to-be-defined newcomer are temperamentally in sync and if nothing else imbue this overly eccentric hybrid with a sense of genuine romantic tragedy via a simple touching concept a perfect couple the halves of which were simply born at the wrong time for each other. If the only movie on Mr. Daniels resume was Noah Baumbachs ""The Squid and the Whale"" hed still have to be considered an odd manner of genius albeit one with a penchant for picking roles that keep him on a professional atoll. Again in ""Paper Man"" Mr. Daniels is wrestling with a character of slippery definition Richard Dunn has authored one novel is trying to write another and has fled to Montauk N.Y. to find his muse. Hes accompanied at first by his wife Claire (a grim-lipped Lisa Kudrow) and their native incompatibility is established with economy and wit Arriving at the cottage they find a dead raccoon on the walk and as Richard fairly writhes in squeamish horror his doctor wife assesses the damage snaps on a pair of rubber gloves and disposes of the beast behind a nearby woodpile. Can this marriage be saved? Why bother? Too odd by half ""Paper Man"" also features Ryan Reynolds as Richards invisible friend Captain Excellent. No were not kidding. With a cape an ostentatious bulge in his bright blue tights and a shock of platinum blond on his head the good Captains near-constant presence suggests that Richard has a closet full of unresolved problems but the more immediate concern is whether an audience can buy all this weirdness and the judgment here is no. Married screenwriters Kieran and Michelle Mulroney who are making their directorial debut try to wed the peculiar to the poignant and they are irreconcilable. Still theres no getting around the chemistry created between Richard and Abby (Ms. Stone) a local girl in a bad relationship. Both Abby and Richard need a friend--Claires a shrew and Abbys brutish boyfriend (Hunter Parrish) treats her shamefully. Her slavish friend Christopher (Kieran Culkin) meanwhile follows her like a puppy reminding her of how her lifes going wrong. With Richard however she shares a sense of humor and intellectual compatibility; and he likes the soup she makes when she comes over to babysit the baby he doesnt have. If not for a 30-year age difference and laws governing minors it might have worked out. No One Knows About Persian Cats Many moviegoers associate Iranian cinema with balloons men contemplating suicide and little children losing their shoes. Bahman Ghobadi is certainly out to change that. ""Based on real events locations and people"" Mr. Ghobadis guerrilla-music movie ""No One Knows About Persian Cats"" is an exhilarating examination of a leading Iranian criminal enterprise--music More than 2000 bands are said to operate clandestinely in the capital of Tehran risking prison to play together in basements bedrooms and rooftops. Its estimated that as much as two thirds of Irans population is under 25 and while they arent all in ""Persian Cats"" their spirit is. ENLARGE Pouya Hosseini Ashkan Koshanejad Kourosh Mirzaei and Negar Shaghaghi in No One Knows About Persian Cats. Mijfilm Mr. Ghobadi shoots in a sprinting documentary style scurrying from band to band from alt-rock to heavy metal to Islamo-rap but theres a story here too Boyfriend/girlfriend Ashkan (Ashkan Koshanejad) and Negar (Negar Shaghaghi) are trying to get a band together to play a show in London and also need the phony documents to get them there. This provides access to all manner of shadowy Tehranian nooks and crannies from music studios to a passport counterfeiter with what seems a global taste in cinema (""Action Action 100 deaths""). Not a fan of most Iranian cinema we suspect but then he hasnt seen ""Persian Cats"" which contains some of the most exciting cinema to be shown this year. The music is wonderful the street shooting gives a sense of the real nonmullah Iran and its very funny When Ashkan and Negar travel to a farm where a heavy-metal band has taken refuge theyre told the cows have stopped eating and giving milk. When the band actually starts playing the cows look of horror is worth the price of admission. --John Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern will return next week. ENLARGE DVD FOCUS The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985) Woody Allens homage to the brawny 30s adventure film and one of the best movies about movies stars Mia Farrow as a downtrodden New Jersey waitress and Jeff Daniels as the intrepid onscreen archaeologist who walks out of his movie and into her life. Mr. Daniels who also plays the actor playing the on-screen role mixes sweetness confusion charisma and sorrow into his twin performances. As as the two men vie for Ms. Farrows heart we get a sweetly eloquent metaphor for the elusive chemistry that bonds movies and their audiences. ENLARGE The Answer Man (2009) Sweet smart and the quintessential mixed bag this is a romance about people becoming other people. Its no secret that when characters are defined via their problems we know the movies going to be about solving those problems and chief among them is the Messiah role the world has foisted on the title character a Salinger-like recluse who 20 years earlier wrote a still-best-selling spiritual-self-helper called ""Me and God."" While debuting writer/director John Hindman fashions a few awkward moments in his cleverly romantic film he was smart enough or lucky enough to have Mr. Daniels play Arlen Faber and to have Lauren Graham Max Antisell Lou Taylor Pucci Kat Dennings and Olivia Thirlby as his supporting cast. ENLARGE The Squid and the Whale (2005) As the supremely arrogant but nearly washed-up novelist Bernard Berkman in Noah Baumbachs caustic domestic comedy Mr. Daniels gave one of the best performances of his career a tour de force of emotional turmoil intellectual constipation and egomania. Said to reflect Mr. Baumbachs own upbringing the film is about the dissolution of a marriage and the effect on its children but Mr. Daniels comes close to making Bernard the whole movie. That he gets to parry with Laura Linney who plays Bernards wife Joan mother to their sons Walt (Jesse Eisenberg) and Frank (Owen Kline) only makes the whole thing more delicious. --John Anderson Find related television listings at LocateTV.

Pictures and Dark Castle Entertainments action thriller The Losers released by Warner Bros. Pictures. (Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures) Joe Neumaier Thursday April 22 2010 937 PM Title The Losers When it comes to action-flick cliches in ""The Losers"" go ahead and pick your poison.Want the ol group-of-guys-walking-in-a-line shot? There are many of those here often with explosions in the background for extra oomph. Prefer the hidden-family-relationship angle? Thats here too subtle as a sledgehammer. The standoff the last-minute precision shot the villain who explains it all the surprise turncoat -- check check double-check. Oh look the characters are introduced in freeze-frame with their names onscreenAnd for extra mundanity there are at least three scenes of our heroes -- nicknamed the Losers -- standing around discussing the important intel they just uncovered.Though its derived from a graphic novel ""The Losers"" might have been born of the audiences collective memory of other light action-adventures (at this point an action flick that took itself seriously would be where real edginess lies unlike the jokey violence-with-a-smirk delivered here). Even Chris Evans as the mad-dog snarkmeister is playing to type. Only Jason Patrics snaky bad guy wakes things up; hes not revolutionary but given the context its like Jim Morrison came back to play 007s nemesis Ernst Stavro Blofeld.Presumed dead in a raid on a drug lord the Losers -- led by Jeffrey Dean Morgan because Clive Owen is too expensive -- go off the grid and cross the globe looking for Max (Patric) the shadowy inside man who set them up and now plans to blow up L.A. and sell nukes to all bidders. Backing up Morgans character Clay are Pooch (Columbus Short) Cougar (Oscar Jaenada) Roque (Idris Elba) and Jensen (Evans) whos notable for his normal name.Theyre led astray ... or are they? ... by Aisha (""Avatars"" Zoe Saldana) a mystery woman with an eyebrow piercing who steals Clays heart then his guns. Or maybe his guns come first but either way the tough chick is in and then shes out and then shes in again just in time for slow-motion leaps and two-handed shootouts.Patrics way to pass the time is to subvert the subversion and play down his bwaa-ha-haa evilness so when he pops up to purr a threat or roll his eyes director Sylvain White finally has something besides pyrotechnics and poseurs in his sights and theres a potential for the jittery out-there-ness of a movie like ""The Rundown"" (whose director Peter Berg co-wrote this screenplay). But it cant help really since ""The Losers"" is simply a lot of low blows telegraphed each and every time.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie review The Losers - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie review The LosersJeffrey Dean Morgan Zoe Saldana and Jason Patric star in a violent bloody and sometimes fun mess.April 23 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Zoe Saldana as Aisha and Jeffrey Morgan as Clay in the action-thriller ""The... (John Bramley / DC Comics/Warner )Thousands of Hummers helicopters hot cars houses hotels and humans a well actors playing humans a were sacrificed to make ""The Losers"" what it is a violent bloody mess. For the action-loving comic-book fans the film has in its sights just one word Duck There are burning fragments of what passes for a story flying around everywhere in the massive debris field that is ""The Losers."" Theres a full metal jacket of pounding sound blood fireballs mayhem double-crosses and the entire future of the U.S. of A. on the line. But the plot? Who decided to kill the plot? Screenwriters Peter Berg of the excellent ""Friday Night Lights"" and James Vanderbilt of the tightwire thriller ""Zodiac"" seem to have lost their moorings here along with director Sylvain White. Bummer. The film had promising roots in the comic books band of irreverent brothers created in the 40s during WWII then reborn into the 21st century as special ops bad boys in 2003 via writer Andy Diggle and artist Jocks DC/Vertigo series. There is charm aplenty in this scruffy bunch. Jeffrey Dean Morgan ( "" Watchmen"") Chris Evans (""Fantastic Four"") Idris Elba ( "" Obsessed"") Columbus Short (""Stomp the Yard"") and Oscar Jaenada (""Che Part Two"") make up the CIA wolf pack forced to go rogue in the backwaters of Bolivia. The film gets a little Adrenalin shot every time they get to use some of it which is not nearly enough. Meanwhile Jason Patric as Max who is suffering from a bad attitude and a receding hairline does a very nice turn as the villain with the heart of cold a mysteriously gloved hand and a teasing mince in his step. ""The Losers"" opens with some questionable boom-boom in which 25 school kids and a teddy bear are blown to bits in a drug bust that goes wrong. Its a frame-up that leaves the Losers for dead. Actually theyre just lying low passing time betting on cockfights and working in a Bolivian sweatshop that makes dolls destined for American toy shelves. Its a slooooow start as the boys wonder if theyll ever make it back home. Instead of ruby slippers which wouldnt fit the mood as surreal as it is they get Zoe Saldanas Aisha who turns up like a bad penny in a black hat. Finally some real action and a ticket back home that includes payback for Max. This chicks all fight as foreplay slinking around in ""action wear"" which I believe is really just a splash of body paint a belt and some boots. By the way apparently those long legs that were blue in ""Avatar"" are hers and not a special effect. The opening violent coupling between Aisha and Clay (Morgan) involves a brutal Tarantino-esque ballet of whirling kicks and bruising chops all delivered with camera moves that would make Linda Blairs head spin faster than the devil. It also brings ""The Losers"" some measure of redemption. From this point on there are enough clever bits in that exploding-bodies kind of way to inject some fun into the party. White and director of photography Scott Kevan who collaborated on ""Stomp the Yard"" have some seriously inventive visuals which at times are smash-cut fabulous. Morgan brings his swag his 5 oclock shadow and his sentimentality to Clay which is really enough for most Morgan fans. Evans as the computer buff whos actually is buff and briefly in the buff has one of the funniest bits a it involves pizza an iPod an elevator and over-exposure. In fact just about every character in ""The Losers"" has promise. Now if only they can locate that plot in case theres a sequel. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-losers-20100423,0,1508554.story",200,thelosers10,thelosers,latimes

But right now the answer is also E) ""The Losers"" as yet another over-the-top action movie blows into theaters before the A-Team and Stallones ""Expendables"" can come in to mop up. The Losers (PG-13) Warner Bros. (97 min.) Directed by Sylvain White. With Jeffrey Dean Morgan Zoe Saldana Jason Patric. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Two stars Rating note The film contains violence sexual situations drug references and a cockfighting scene. Based on the DC/Vertigo comic -- and about a dozen other movies going back to ""The Dirty Dozen"" -- ""The Losers"" features a motley crew of bad good guys with names like Roque Cougar and Pooch. Overgrown 12-year-olds -- a little like their natural audience -- they spend their days playing cards cracking ""Yo mama"" jokes and saving innocent children from twitchy Bolivian drug lords. Until one day theyre sold out targeted for assassination. Looks like its time to bring the war home. Looks like its also time to put your feet up and turn your mind off as ""The Losers"" -- co-written by Peter Berg who made the similarly loud and out-of-control ""The Kingdom"" -- makes a whole lot of noise without making a great deal of sense. Who for example is their mad nemesis Max and how -- and why -- did he manage to put a hit out on these top-flight agents? Why do these experts need the help of a mysterious femme fatale to get back home? Why is that poor guy called Pooch? These and other burning questions are never answered. But then one probably shouldnt expect much from a movie that says Sinn Fein when it means the IRA has people say hello by launching into fistfights and builds its plot around a world-destroying ""sonic dematerializer."" The movie itself is in danger of dematerializing too held together only by a few good performances. Jeffrey Dean Morgan -- the Comedian in ""Watchmen"" -- brings a beefy charisma to Clay the teams leader. Zoe Saldana shed of her blue ""Avatar"" skin makes a sexy kickboxing co-star. And enjoying his own private joke is Jason Patric who plays Max with a big fat wink. Whether hes shooting an associate for a minor mistake or modeling one of his many gloves -- he has a scarred hand you see and is a mite sensitive -- hes having fun. Us? Not so much. Even at just over an hour-and-a-half the film feels padded (theres a long subplot about a computer code that adds nothing but time). And the ending which skips several resolutions just so it can threaten a sequel feels like a cheat. The whole things a painless enough time-waster as far as B movies go. But films like this were a lot easier to take when they were real B movies and starred Fred ""the Hammer"" Williamson or Jim Brown -- and only cost 3 as the bottom half of a double-feature.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Losers  (out of four)Stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan Zoe Saldana Idris Elba Chris Evans Jason Patric Columbus Short}Director Sylvain WhiteDistributor Warner Bros.Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense action and violence a scene of sensuality and languageRunning time 1 hour 38 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Though they have plenty of lethal weapons at their disposal the Losers are nowhere near as fun as the 80s action-flick heroes they emulate. Instead theyre capable of only vacant banter and offhand brutality. The latest movie spawned from the pages of a comic book The Losers has a few funny scenes but a lot more foolish ones. It tries to be stylish but is more often just trashy-trendy. Drenched in violence it should have gotten an R rating. TRAILER Meet The Losers Director Sylvain White (Stomp the Yard) tries a smash-up of irreverent comedy and non-stop action a la Lethal Weapon. But the combination of actors is anything but combustible. Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Zoe Saldana are supposed to be setting off sparks but they lack any sizzle. The movie is busy noisy and fiery and the cliched slo-mo is set on overkill. The eponymous characters are a Special Forces ops team sent to Bolivia to stake out and take out a drug lord. The search-and-destroy mission goes awry. They learn they were the targets along with 25 innocent children. The rest of the movie is about payback. Presumed dead the guys languish in South America until their swaggering leader Clay (Morgan) is propositioned by the mysterious Aisha (Saldana). A tough operative herself she promises to get them back into the USA where they can exact their revenge and also do her a deadly favor. While not superheroes their comic-book origins show through as they bounce back after being beaten and shot as if they were crash-test dummies. The team is after the shadowy Max (Jason Patric) who is hellbent on orchestrating a high-tech global war. In other words hes evil with a capital E. He illustrates this by killing nebbishy men for sport rudely poking a dwarf waiter and making snotty Slumdog Millionaire allusions to his weapons designers from India. The cheap laughs are sporadic. Chris Evans (Fantastic Four) plays Jensen a computer geek who sports ridiculous T-shirts and is obsessed with his nieces soccer prowess. But hes funny in a scene in which he goes undercover in an office tower. Idris Elba as the scar-faced rough-edged Roque is the only character with any dimension. Columbus Short is Pooch a getaway driver who yearns to get home to his pregnant wife. Oscar Jaenada probably has a total of two sentences of dialogue as the teams eagle-eyed sniper. Its unclear why hes called Cougar as if he were some randy middle-aged woman. Saldanas Aisha is a hard-casecipher. She participates in shootouts in her underwear and sets a hotel on fire essentially to show off. The film has a particularly inane ending its hard edges going all soft. The film oddly mixes sadism and sappiness. If non-stop pyrotechnics and predictable gunplay amid a scenario of misogyny sounds appealing then go slumming with The Losers. Otherwise revisit one of the Lethal Weapons or check out a more inventive comic-book caper Kick-Ass.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr TOUGH GUY (AND GIRL) Zoe Saldana and Jeffrey Dean Morgan play betrayed CIA black-ops agents in The Losers. (Warner Bros.) C+ The Losers Starring Jeffrey Dean Morgan Zoe Saldana; Starring Chris Evans; Director Sylvain White; Author Peter Berg James Vanderbilt; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted April 23 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT In the jungles of South America a team of CIA black-ops agents is betrayed and left for dead. Only the five soldiers are very much alive and theyre coming back for revenge. The Losers is a pulp action rouser based on a comic-book series but its derivative of many other sources -- basically its The A-Team meets Rambo meets Mission Impossible with a mission thats one part trickiness four parts blowing stuff up. As Clay the team leader Jeffrey Dean Morgan has an amusingly rumpled ordinary-schmo nonchalance. How tough is he? Hes so tough that when questioned he punches out a fellow soldier played by the maximally intimidating Idris Elba (as the most insurrectionary of the team members). Jason Patric is also on hand as a supervillain out to hawk a terrorist weapon that can make a landmass implode and Patric gives clipped funny furiously contained line readings; he wears bloodless misanthropy lightly (which is how it should be worn). But there isnt enough invention or surprise to the rest of this relentless numbing bang-bang militia-fest which hops from Bolivia to Dubai to Mexico to the concrete urban jungles of Miami and Los Angeles. As Clays love interest Zoe Saldana looking like a superskinny Beyonce is allowed to show the humor that Avatar squeezed out of her.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The Losers is another plastic thingamabob thats been hoisted up by one of those carnival claw machines. The amusement it provides is cheap disposable and hardly worth the number of quarters you fed into the slot in a frenzy not to go home empty-handed. Its based on a comic book from one of DCs offshoots and the director Sylvain White does everything he can to approximate the unreality of certain comic book titles. In an early sequence the films gang of CIA-contracted mercenaries ambushes a bad guys Bolivian compound. The bullets hit bodies the bodies wrench and the frame freezes. Rinse and repeat.The quintet of mercenaries is introduced in close-ups that hold long enough for the live-action to burst into a comic book sketch that prints the characters nickname and function. So its clear the actors playing these men -- Jeffrey Dean Morgan Idris Elba Chris Evans Columbus Short and Oscar Jaenada -- will live and die based on their ability to riff on one note. (Evans and Short prove budding maestros at this.)The movie looks bright and feels manic. Its going for ""thwap ""pow and ""bam. The images in the frame speed up and slow down. And very few shots last longer than two or three seconds. Like nearly all action movies horror films and thrillers in the last 15 years a sense of motion is conveyed predominately with editing as opposed to through physical space. The compression of time distance and movement into hectic cuts is deadening. This was a style of storytelling perfected by the editor Dede Allen who died last week. Her work -- ""The Hustler ""Bonnie and Clyde  and ""Dog Day Afternoon for example -- could be swift but it was always soulful never losing a story or the energy that drives it forward. This new mode of editing what the film scholar David Bordwell has called ""intensified continuity stampedes over both natural spatial relations and cinematic ingenuity.Things move fast in ""The Losers but nothing feels urgent. The movie revolves around the mens hunt for the corrupt boss (Jason Patric) who betrayed them and the sex bomb-assassin-mystery woman (Zoe Saldana) who promises to lead them to him. Maybe Im waiting for a version of this to happen all over again in this summers ""The A-Team makeover but I didnt care whether these guys found their target. Neither really does the film which was co-written by the actor and director Peter Berg whose propulsive virile moviemaking (""The Rundown ""Friday Night Lights ""The Kingdom) White emulates.But jokiness rots the thrill. Patric thinks his dapper oily villain is better than it actually is. Hes just doing Gene Hackman in ""Superman. As with ""Kick-Ass and Guy Ritchies ""Sherlock Holmes heavy artillery in ""The Losers is deployed for comedy. When a cornered Evans points his fingers like a gun and squeezes the guards who surround him fall down. Until a snipers assistance is confirmed it looks like magic.The movie is more persuasive tussling and shooting than it is trying to connect with people. Anyway we see Morgan and Saldana connecting principally through brute force. Weve reached a point in American movies where violence is the new sex. Once upon a time when say the screenwriter Joe Eszterhas was one of Hollywoods most lucrative viruses in the 1980s and early 90s most violence was graphic and merely lewdly suggestive. When Sharon Stone wanted sex she strapped Michael Douglas to her bed.Gradually depictions of sex declined while a new type of violence seemed to flourish. The Ezsterhas era which saw a rise in the number of mysteriously dangerous women peaked by 1992 and the Quentin Tarantino period began. Tarantino wrote parts for women. Sometimes men hit those women. And Tarantino being a kind of revenge feminist found ways for the women to hit back. In everything from ""Charlies Angels  and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith  to Tarantinos two ""Kill Bill  movies women and men fight each other with mutual delight.A movie like ""The Losers which unbelievably enough is rated PG-13 sees this to its logical end. Morgan and Saldana punch each other silly. She throws him into a wall. He returns the favor. Her legs wind up wrapped around him. He winds up underneath her. Depending on where you stand the ubiquity of all the red in the room signals either romance or sadism. But its more inane than hot -- and predicted years ago by David Cronenbergs ""A History of Violence. Morgan and Saldanas actual love scenes are paint-drying affairs by comparison. Rough stuff is the only intimacy this movie knows. Forget condoms. Wear Kevlar. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

(And after it offends it numbs.)Certainly the difference has something to do with the writing and the wit behind all the firefights and slo-mo mayhem. In the case of The Losers the script is boilerplate the wit pretty much witless.Starring a smug squad of crack special forces operatives The Losers opens in the jungles of Bolivia where team leader Clay (Watchmens swaggering superdude Jeffrey Dean Morgan) demolitions expert Roque (The Wires Idris Elba) computer whiz Jensen (Fantastic Fours Chris Evans) and a couple of other guys with barely a line between them (Columbus Short and Oscar Jaenada) are arranging to level a drug lords compound - and the drug lord with it.But then a school bus full of little kids rolls up (Hey parents Tomorrow theres a field trip to meet the countrys biggest coke dealer) and Clay and company try to call off the mission.HQ doesnt want to hear about it. The plane and the payload are on the way. And so the renegade quintet take it upon themselves to rescue the children before the air strike. Things dont go according to plan however and in the fiery and exploitatively tragic aftermath Clay Roque and the rest are presumed dead reduced to dog tags and ash.The fact that theyre lying low in a seedy town (cockfights hookers) is known only by the eyebrow-pierced CIA-connected Aisha (Zoe Saldana) who promises to get the gang back into the States if they help her take out an evil arms dealer bent on world domination. This fellow Max is played by just about the last actor youd go looking to cast as an evil arms dealer bent on world domination the brooding Jason Patric. Comic villainy - nay comedy period - is not this mans forte.Considerably less spiritual but no less sinewy than she was as Neytiri the Navi princess of Avatar Saldanas Aisha picks up Clay in a bar and then goes back to his hotel room where a kickboxing head-butting face-punching frenzy ensues. Its a new kind of seduction scene I guess pointless but kinetic.Director Sylvain White shows himself adept at the action stuff using whooshing cutaways and a busy stunt crew as he orchestrates the shoulder-launched missile strikes and jokey annihilations. (Watch Patric gun down his pretty assistant when she bumbles the sunbrella shes holding over his head. Har-har.)The movies pop-irony prize goes to the scene with Evans character sneaking into Maxs high-security offices to download a computer file and using Journeys ""Dont Stop Believin "" as his personal theme song.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Originating as a DC Comics World War II series in the early 70s The Losers got its title from a Special Forces group who dubbed themselves ""The Losers"" to honor the military personnel lost under their command. This is helpful background information because in the new version--updated for Vertigo in the mid-00s by writer Andy Diggle and artist Jock and now adapted into cinematic dreck of the highest magnitude--the meaning of the title gets completely lost. There isnt a whiff of humility or self-deprecation to Clay Roque Jensen Cougar and Pooch a collection of black-ops douchebags and our ostensible heroes. Even when theyre off saving two dozen Bolivian schoolchildren from an impending air attack they seem motivated less by compassion than by the dumb adventure of it. Anything to add to their mythos. Its a bad sign when the soldiers are mainly defined by small flourishes in their appearance. Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) the leader dresses like a Miami Vice castoff minus the pastels Roque (Idris Elba) has a long vertical scar around his eye Cougar (Oscar Jaenada) wont let anyone touch his leather cowboy hat and so on. Betrayed and left for dead in the Bolivian jungle after getting set up on a CIA mission Clay and the gang join forces with the lethal Aisha (Zoe Saldana) to get back to the States and seek their revenge. Their nemesis is a comically evil mystery man named Max played by Jason Patric whos striking hundred-million-dollar deals with terrorists over nuclear arms--or some such nonsense anyway. Director Sylvain White whose credits include Stomp The Yard and a straight-to-video I Know What You Did Last Summer sequel punches up every scene with comic-book graphics multiple film speeds freeze frames and/or other splashy effects. Theres nothing wrong with style for its own sake but The Losers works so strenuously to be cool at every moment that it can only be anything but. Pitched to adolescent boys--who are free to enjoy the sanitized violence and sadism under a PG-13 rating--the film takes the form of an extended trailer that never stops selling itself. Whats being sold is anyones guess. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review The Back-Up Plan Next Movie Review Mercy Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Comments The Losers Video Rated PG-13  98 minutes  2010 High-ordnance action stuff adapted from a DC Comics series about a special-ops team that goes rogue to shut down a villain with loose nukes. As youve probably guessed the heroes are all wisecracking eccentrics formidable in their respective fields (which are spelled out onscreen but all sound like Soldier of Fortune gobbledygook). As the bad guy Jason Patric gets the funniest lines but there are plenty to go around; though rigidly formulaic the movie is undeniably good-humored if you dont count all those minor characters getting shot in the face.

"The Losers Another comic book makes the big screen - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 2 1/2 starsThe Losers Another comic book makes the big screenApril 22 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticA B-minus edition of ""The A-Team"" the comic book adaptation ""The Losers"" drags you down to its level at gunpoint with its drooling fetishization of weaponry its focus on Zoe Saldana in wee shorts various and sundry assassinations designed with gamers in mind and more rabid mistrust of the U.S. government and its freedom-destroying institutions than youd find at a tea party fundraiser. Were about as far from the quasi-lefty ""Bourne"" franchise as a moviegoer can get. Here when enemies or even collateral-damage bystanders are wiped out (sometimes with tranquilizer darts more often with real bullets though the film barely distinguishes between the two) its smirks and sub-James Bond-level wisecracks all around. Except when children are involved. In the prologue Jason Patric as a shadowy CIA-backed antagonist orders an assault on a helicopter full of adorable Bolivian kids. This is what sends our titular losers Special Forces warriors assigned to wipe out a drug cartel over the edge and off the grid. Presumed dead the team led by Clay ( Jeffrey Dean Morgan whose blase approach to the material suggests a bearded Perry Como) vows revenge and bloodshed and splosions. With the help of a butt-kicking butt-waving colleague (Saldana) thats what they do and thats what ""The Losers"" delivers. Director Sylvain White (""Stomp the Yard"") doesnt edit action scenes so much as turn each micro-beat into a trading card with a fireball in the background. For all its insidious slickness -- the deeply saturated massively bright imagery comes courtesy of cinematographer Scott Kevan -- the film is easier to take than say ""Kick-Ass"" or ""V for Vendetta"" both of which came to the screen saddled with misguided pretentions. No pretentions here. Even so the politics are slippery. Throughout artfully dodgy images of American flags -- or in the pointed case of its heinous villain played by Patric a U.S. flag lapel pin -- signify hypocrisy and slaughter at the ready. The movies laden with other hypocrisies as well. ""Enough of this revenge bushwa"" says one Loser though I may have misheard ""bushwa."" Its a punch line The movie is all revenge all the time. Later a minor character from India forced to implement a doomsday ""sonic de-materializer"" decries his colleagues ""Yankee Doodle tough-guy bushwa."" And yet what would ""The Losers"" be without it? 2 1/2 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for scenes of intense action and violence a scene of sensuality and language)Cast Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Clay); Zoe Saldana (Aisha); Chris Evans (Jensen); Idris Elba (Roque); Columbus Short (Pooch); Oscar Jaenada (Cougar); Jason Patric (Max)Credits Directed by Sylvain White; written by Peter Berg and James Vanderbilt based on the comic books by Andy Diggle and Jock; produced by Joel Silver Akiva Goldsman and Kerry Foster.

The Losers Bad to fair Director Sylvain White. Cast Jeffrey Dean Morgan Zoe Saldana Idris Elba. Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense action and violence a scene of sensuality and language. RELATED Movies based on comic books Spy movies Thats to say it is big silly loud and uneven never pretending to be anything more than that or evidently wanting to be. The stylized camera work the occasional blending of scenes into illustrated panels the nobody-but-bad-guys-get-shot (unless crucial to the story) mentality and the general goofball vibe never let the audience forget that this is a comic book come to life. As opposed to say ""Iron Man"" or ""The Dark Knight"" which are also based on comics but offer something more when translated to the screen. Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays Clay the leader of a CIA black-ops team betrayed and left for dead in a sabotaged mission in Bolivia targeted by a mysterious agent known to them only as Max who doesnt get his prey but does in a distasteful twist kill 25 children. Perhaps its supposed to add some weight to the story but it just seems wildly out of place in the context of the rest of the film. All of the members of Clays team - Jensen (Chris Evans) Pooch (Columbus Short) Cougar (Oscar Jaenada) and Roque (Idris Elba) - specialize in some form of intrigue or other most of it involving guns and knives and such. Assumed dead they lie low and scheme to get their lives back and plot revenge against Max played in a most-curious fashion by Jason Patrick. Into the mix drops Aisha (Zoe Saldana) who is willing to help the others simply to get to Max. Somehow Aisha has access to enough money to fund the effort and is pretty kick-butt herself when it comes to well kicking butt. Most of the group thinks shes setting them up of course but Clay doesnt let that stop him from the occasional romantic interlude with her (yes thats a euphemism). So off they go running one mission after the other to get to Max with varying degrees of success. The plots not that important really beyond the basics revenge sprinkled with action. Short and Jaenada arent given much to do but Evans has fun with the tech-genius role of Jensen particularly during a scene in which he steals information from an office computer which includes his belting out ""Dont Stop Believin "" by Journey. Saldinas Aisha spends most of her time angry or if particularly moved fighting uttering lamentable lines like ""This isnt over."" Morgans OK nothing more; its not clear from this whether he can carry an action movie. Clay and Roque are the closest of the bunch but thats only hinted at. (Elba is as always good though we dont learn much about the moody Roque.) Then there is Patrick. His Max is hoping to start a war so that the U.S. might flex its muscle against terrorism regain its stature in the world that sort of thing. He is clearly insane offering Patrick ample opportunity to go nuts with the role. At first hes entertaining enough bumping right up against the line between playing it just right and going over the top. Eventually he crosses that line however and never looks back turning Max into a caricature instead of a character. Its a bizarre choice one White should have reined in. Given the hit-and-miss nature of ""The Losers"" however he probably had other things on his mind. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Its the bad guys vs. the worse guys in ""The Losers"" director Sylvain Whites slick throwback to 80s-style action movies delivering elaborate setpieces big explosions and larger-than-life characters in service of a stock betrayed-by-the-Man plot. The key difference While ""The Losers"" looks to retro tough-talkin hard-R testosterone-fests for inspiration polishing the formula somewhat with contempo pacing and effects the result feels candy-coated for the PG-13 crowd. Released amid mixed marketing messages pic will depend on teen interest in post-""Avatar"" Zoe Saldana and an obscure DC Comics title to eke out a modest opening weekend. Rooting interests are a ragtag bunch of Special Forces operatives none of them stable enough to pass a standard psych exam yet plenty resourceful when it comes to exacting revenge. Each identified by a nickname (Clay Roque Jensen Pooch Cougar) and a defiantly unsubtle physical characteristic (two-day beard four-inch facial scar mangy goatee and granny glasses bald head ponytail) the five guys are sent in to eliminate a target deep in the Bolivian jungle (actually scenic Puerto Rico). Spotting a truck full of children in the drug dealers compound the five risk their own lives to intervene only to be betrayed by their backstabbing boss Max (a high-level CIA player known only by voice) who engineers the explosion of their rescue chopper with the moppets on board. Naturally theyre outraged but its the audience that has reason to be upset that the movie could introduce and then toast 20 kids simply to explain why its protags switched sides. Enter Aisha (Saldana) a character whose specialty seems to be instigating arbitrary fight and sex scenes. Like the Losers she wants Max dead though her motives are less clear. Amid tongue-in-cheek talk of ""snukes"" (imploding bombs that deliver ""all the destruction none of the pollution"") and other all-purpose villainy Aishas presence among the guys triggers much of the banter that passes for personality in Peter Berg and James Vanderbilts recycled-parts screenplay. The challenge when every line feels lifted from countless pics before it is to make things sound fresh. Theres a little bit of Nicolas Cages ""Bad Lieutenant"" mojo in Jason Patrics turn as Max with the thesp pushing the psychopath shtick so far he clearly isnt afraid to see his work embraced as camp. Otherwise a few against-type casting choices make the team more memorable than its actual shenanigans. Kudos to whoever imagined Chris Evans in the endearing dork role of Jensen for example and bonus points for choosing Idris Elba as blades-and-bomb expert Roque (who was white in the original comic). The others feel like second or third choices for their parts with ""Watchmens"" Jeffrey Dean Morgan delivering plenty of grizzle but no charisma as the Losers team leader Clay. Pic serves as a reminder that Hollywoods recent fad of pulp-based franchise reboots (including Batman Spidey and Hulk) finds its roots in the comicbook biz itself. The underlying ""A-Team""-style limited series was itself Vertigos name-only reinvention of an early-70s DC combat comic and just as writer Andy Diggle and illustrator Jock used ""The Losers"" as an excuse to flash their style so too does helmer White with his feature adaptation. Lifting the best sequences from the comic -- so many in fact that the pic virtually defines the idea of ""action-packed"" -- White demonstrates an aptitude for spectacle worthy of producer Joel Silvers imprimatur. Project marks a big step up from ""Stomp the Yard"" the urban dance showcase that jumpstarted Whites career though it betrays a disheartening interest in surface over substance. ""The Losers"" is the sort of pyro-heavy exercise parodied in ""Tropic Thunder"" and no amount of production polish can hide the hollowness beneath its junk-food high.

But in adapting ""The Losers"" for film director Sylvain White and screenwriters James Vanderbilt and Peter Berg strain to achieve the pleasurable mix of cheap laughs and expensive action that Lethal Weapon pulled off effortlessly with the help of its stellar cast. (In a remarkable example of an actor finding his ideal role Gary Busey played LWs haywire half-cocked villain.) What theyve produced instead is a busy unsatisfying comic thriller poorly acted by a grab bag of new faces and franchise movie refugees and set to a hard-rock soundtrack.The Losers opens with its eponymous team of Special Forces ops staking out a drug lords South American compound preparing for attack. The inconveniently timed arrival of a busload of children provides both an opportunity for our heroes to show their nobility and a herd of adorable sacrificial lambs to set the movies plot shuddering ahead. One smoldering teddy bear later the Losers are presumed dead--and loaded for revenge on the shadowy figure who tried to take them out. (Oh and killed 25 children.)Who is that shadowy figure? Why its Max played by Jason Patric about whom it must be said Hes no Gary Busey. While that is a great comfort Im sure to Patrics neighbors its little help to the movie. Max has a deep tan ties to the CIA and an interest in a very fake-seeming weapon called a ""snuke"" (a sonic nuke obviously). Max swans around a number of exotic locales occasionally killing some poor soul for sport but Patric plays his scenes so ineptly (often for laughs but hes bad at comedy) that Max becomes an object of scorn rather than as is proper in any good action movie of fascination. He wears a single white glove He makes Slumdog Millionaire jokes to his Indian weapons designers His character is a mishmash of bad ideas and Patric lacks the charisma to bring any of them to life.In the face of this unworthy adversary were dependent on our heroes to carry the movie. But only one of them shows real signs of life. Idris Elba as the scar-faced Roque acts as the groups voice of reason and is the only character whose surface coolness peels back to reveal hidden depths. The rest are just types. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Watchmen) is the cocksure leader--a meatier less nimble Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans (Fantastic Four) is the smart-ass computer expert who wears stupid T-shirts and makes the ladies swoon. Columbus Short and Oscar Jaenada barely make an impression as respectively the garrulous family man and the silent sniper.And then theres Zoe Saldana who--as Uhura in Star Trek and Neytiri in Avatar--showed herself to have relatively good taste in blockbusters. It fails her here and her character an Agency asset named Aisha is a disaster especially compared to the Aisha that Diggle dreamed up for his comics series. Im not one to demand that comic-book movies remain utterly faithful to their source material; such unyielding fealty sure didnt do Watchmen any favors. And anyway Diggles Losers is a lark not a classic--from its first issue it was begging for the Hollywood treatment. But it would be nice if full-scale character rewrites made characters better not lamer. In the comic Aisha is intimidating complicated and spooky a native Afghan whose childhood battles with Soviet soldiers gave her a taste for blood. In the movie? Shes a sexpot who wears red leather pants (or during shootouts her underwear). The comics biz has always written oversexualized underdeveloped female characters. In The Losers Hollywood manages to out-comic the comics.
