Reese Witherspoon is Elizabeth a busy doctor who has a car crash. Months later lonely David (Mark Ruffalo) rents her apartment and is startled to share it with Elizabeths ghostly apparition. Elizabeth herself thought she was alive and well until she started walking through walls so David must help her investigate a mystery that we can decode within minutes. Not much tension then but theres chemistry between the pair as they banter their way towards an inevitable romance. Waters brings a welcome touch of gallows humour although his tendency to abandon it in favour of sentiment makes Just Like Heaven a guilty pleasure rather than a match for his darker work like Mean Girls. Lets just say fans of Waters Freaky Friday remake can consider it a return to form.

(AP ... more Photo PETER IOVINO Cutesy ghost plot takes realistic turn 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Just Like Heaven Romantic comedy. Starring Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo. Directed by Mark Waters. (PG-13. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A spectacular San Francisco apartment is hard to come by. So when a landscape architect in ""Just Like Heaven"" scores a lavishly appointed one-bedroom on Russian Hill with drop-dead views from every room even the kitchen theres got to be a catch. And there is The previous tenant returned from the dead to haunt the joint. Said ghost Elizabeth turns out to be a control freak. No surprise considering shes played by Reese Witherspoon who is close to being typecast in that role for eternity. Elizabeth vehemently objects to her successor David (Mark Ruffalo) leaving ring marks on the coffee table. When David wishes to summon her an increasingly frequent occurrence as he starts to fall for his wispy personal ghost he holds up a hot coffee mug and threatens to set it down without a coaster. Hollywood has long poked lighthearted fun at death by creating eccentric but lovable apparitions from the world beyond. Who wouldnt want to hang out with Cary Grant in ""Topper"" or that twinkle-eyed spirit who led Jimmy Stewart around in ""Its a Wonderful Life""? Elizabeth appears to be another of their ilk an adorably evanescent presence who for all her bluster and unavailability is still the first woman to win Davids affection in a long time. Witherspoon and Ruffalo seem ill matched -- and not just because shes tiny blond and terminally perky and hes big dark-haired and brooding. She deftly handles comedy while Ruffalo struggles with it. His strong point has always been showing his emotions not exhibiting a funny bone. But theyre OK together anyway. They have a Lucy-Desi thing going where his seriousness allows her to show off making him appear generous in the process. Ruffalo even gets a laugh showering in plaid boxer shorts a gesture of modesty after David realizes the bathroom is Elizabeths favorite haunt. Just when ""Just Like Heaven"" becomes too cloyingly cute to endure it takes an unexpected turn. The humor shifts from the ha-ha variety to closer to black. While we arent exactly in ""Six Feet Under"" territory the script by Peter Tolan and Leslie Dixon (based on a Marc Levy novel) suddenly raises darkly realistic life-and-death issues. Unfortunately director Mark Waters who proved he could do comedy with ""Mean Girls"" and ""Freaky Friday"" cant find a way to handle the transition visually. He keeps throwing out sight gags. The result is that you dont realize the implications of the issues raised (some of which have made the news recently) until ""Just Like Heaven"" is over. The last half is so superior to the first that you wish theyd rethought the whole thing and devised a way to make it more of a one piece. Early scenes when Elizabeth is still among the living are riddled with cliches. Shes depicted as an overachieving doctor displaying the same zeal as Witherspoons overachieving lawyer in ""Legally Blonde."" After tending to patients for 26 hours straight Elizabeth is alert enough to glance at an X-ray several feet away and determine theres no fracture. With such diagnostic skills its a shame that a heavy truck soon smashes into her light car. But its a bigger shame that Waters resorts to showing a bank of heavy fog over the Golden Gate Bridge to indicate its curtains for his lead character. The director and his crew appear to have spent some time in San Francisco instead of just grabbing a few establishing shots. David ventures to the Mission and Dolores Park and Caffe Trieste and Mooses get plugs when he frequents them. But St. Matthews where Elizabeth practiced medicine doesnt exist. With all the mayhem that transpires there including unauthorized moving around of patients its hardly surprising no actual San Francisco hospital was eager for a close-up. -- Advisory This film contains mild sexual content.

"Complete fluff but so adorable - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Life Complete fluff but so adorablemovies - reviewA romantic comedy puts charming Reese Witherspoon on a pedestal lit just rightSeptember 16 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticJust Like Heaven is a sweet little nothing that is barely there about a girl who isnt there at all.But because that girl is Reese Witherspoon well happily sit through this Ghost/All of Me fantasy hokum because well shes just as cute as a button and that just-as-cute Mark Ruffalo is just perfect for her.Witherspoon plays an ambitious young San Francisco doctor who works insane hours but who forgets to squeeze a little personal life in between the life-and-death job.Then one day that imperfect life the life not lived is over. A morose hard-drinking landscaper (Ruffalo) moves into her old apartment. She tries to chase him out but she cant.Shes a ""spirit"" or some such. Hes the only one who can see her. And hes ruining her too-perfect apartment.""Its like a pig moved into my house"" she declares and cant you just hear her say that? ""A filthy pig""They spend the rest of the movie trying to work their way around that -- first to see who gets the apartment then to find out who she is/was and finally to make a difference in each others lives.As gloomy romances go this one always errs on the side of adorable. Director Mark Waters loses whatever edge he had in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls and that wasnt much to turn out a perfectly competent Reese-on-a-pedestal comedy.She is made-up and lit with the attention Hefner used to put into centerfolds. Her Elizabeth is the best-looking spook in the graveyard if indeed thats where she is.The ""couple"" are helped out by a couple of silly supporting players -- Jon ""Napoleon Dynamite"" Heder is a ""dude"" who runs an afterlife/conspiracy theory/UFO bookstore. Donal Logue of TVs Grounded for Life is a daffy shrink-pal who tries to talk our boy into not seeing things.And there are just enough one-liners to keep us amused in between Ruffalos delightful bursts of physical comedy. He takes falls acts ""possessed"" by her when she steps into his body and does all sorts of goofy stuff that we dont associate with him so long as we remember In the Cut and forget 13 Going on 30.And Witherspoon effortlessly charms in that way of hers so that you know theres a happy ending even when the movie falls utterly on its face over its own plot devices at about the 45-minute mark.Its every bit as full of hooey as Bewitched or The Exorcism of Emily Rose for that matter. And while it may not be ""just like heaven"" it is movie meringue -- sweet weightless fun. Youd have to be satanic to begrudge Ms. Witherspoon that which she does so darned well.

"Just Like Heaven Cupids Fatal Arrow washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Just Like Heaven Cupids Fatal Arrow Mark Ruffalo and Reese Witherspoon have sweet chemistry but cant save this misfire. (Dreamworks Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday September 16 2005 ""Just Like Heaven"" is outlandish uneven preposterous and often maddeningly morbid. And it features three shots of Mark Ruffalo getting out of the shower. This featherweight romantic comedy starring Reese Witherspoon purveys the kind of fantastical fluff that when skillfully handled can make an otherwise forgettable chick flick a beloved middlebrow classic on a par with ""When Harry Met Sally . . ."" and ""Sleepless in Seattle."" Despite its strenuous attempts to pluck the same heartstrings ""Just Like Heaven"" will never make that pantheon. But it does feature three shots of Mark Ruffalo getting out of the shower. That caveat means a lot to a certain subculture of mostly female filmgoers who can generally be described -- or diagnosed -- as having a serious Mark Ruffalo Problem. Meaning We -- sorry they -- will see any movie Ruffalo is in despite its artistic aspirations redeeming social value running time or degree of awfulness. If you have a Mark Ruffalo Problem ""You Can Count on Me"" is as good as ""In the Cut"" is as good as ""13 Going on 30"" is as good as ""We Dont Live Here Anymore."" And ""Just Like Heaven"" is very good indeed for MRP people or even for less rabid fans of this gifted actor who has proved his acting chops in such smart movies as ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" and ""Collateral"" while carving out an unexpected but winning sideline as a romantic leading man lending scruffy thoroughly disarming charm to roles that usually call for the acting equivalent of Bachelor No. 2. Here that role is to be a credible love interest for far-higher-wattage Witherspoon (just look at how theyre portrayed on the movies poster) and the chemistry works largely because his understated sweetness plays so nicely against her preternaturally chirpy persona. When David Abbott (Ruffalo) moves into a fantastic San Francisco apartment and is immediately told to move out by its former tenant -- Elizabeth Martinson (Witherspoon) who three months earlier was hit head-on by a truck -- their banter crackles with tart unforced verve. By now Elizabeth a compulsively perky doctor has become something of a tiresome stock character for Witherspoon but here the prissy veneer is absorbed and softened by Ruffalos low-key unaffected magnetism. As it becomes increasingly clear that Elizabeth isnt a real woman but a spirit visiting from another dimension the comedy picks up even more with some funny bits referencing earlier movies (""Youre mopping that up"" Elizabeth snaps after a priest scatters holy water during an exorcism) Jon Heder (the echt-nerd from ""Napoleon Dynamite"") spacily chewing the scenery as a psychic bookstore clerk and Ruffalo engaging in a bit of inspired physical comedy as the invisible Elizabeth tries to wrest a glass of Scotch from Davids hands. Indeed as long as Elizabeth and David are trying to figure out what exactly happened to her ""Just Like Heaven"" promises to be an inter-spiritual romance with the ethereal whimsy of such forebears as ""Blithe Spirit"" and ""Heaven Can Wait"" (as well as that movies own forebear ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan""). But then they figure out what happened to her and ""Just Like Heaven"" undergoes a radical shift in tone that gives it a ripped-from-the-headlines seriousness raising troubling end-of-life issues that seem more at home in the pronouncements of Rep. Tom DeLay than a Saturday night date movie. Try as he might director Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"" ""Freaky Friday"") working from an adaptation of a best-selling French novel called ""If Only It Were True"" cant quite thread the needle on this one. ""Just Like Heaven"" is a misfire made all the more unsatisfying by a penultimate plot twist that beggars belief even by this movies fantastical standards. (In another lamentable if purely coincidental turn of events one of the movies supporting characters -- a voracious predatory force of nature as it happens -- is named Katrina.) Throw in a crass subtext regarding San Franciscos cutthroat real estate market and despite some genuinely funny scenes and its sweet central relationship ""Just Like Heaven"" turns into a bait-and-switch of a movie wrapping weirdly maudlin speculation inside the candy coating of a frothy romance. But it does feature three shots of Mark Ruffalo getting out of the shower. Just Like Heaven (101 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some sexual content.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post When Reese Witherspoon is bad she is so so good. When shes good though shes often bad. Let me explain When the pixie plays a punk as in the trashy 1996 gem ""Freeway"" or the 1999 masterpiece ""Election"" her single-minded pursuit of pleasure and self-promotion has the paradoxical effect of melting our hearts. Reese was the original mean girl flashing her perfect teeth like switchblades reflecting a million-watt smile. But when Witherspoon plays the sweetheart roles mainstream America seems to write for her she fades toward the average. The romantic comedy ""Just Like Heaven"" not very romantic and certainly not very funny hides Witherspoons interesting edges behind bland pantsuits and earnest hospital scrubs. Didnt we learn from the treacly boredom of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" and ""Legally Blonde 2""? Witherspoon is even smarter than she is pretty and works best in extreme roles that showcase her stretching from the dumb to the dangerous. Director Mark Waters tried drawing Witherspoon out with a casting trick instead of a great script. Sloppy cute boy Marc Ruffalo is her foil and perhaps Waters thought matching a trim beauty with a smirking slacker would be enough. It isnt. Ruffalo looks positively nauseated at finding himself in a mainstream comedy instead of the darker fare of ""You Can Count on Me"" or ""In the Cut."" Each time he walks off screen you get the idea he might be stalking off the set for good. Like all ghost movies the premise of ""Just Like Heaven"" is wraith-thin. Witherspoon is a driven med-school graduate too tired to drive straight. On the way from the hospital to a blind date at her sisters house she slams into a truck. Enter a heavily medicated Ruffalo recovering from the recent death of his wife. He has rented Witherspoons killer San Francisco apartment like all the characters ignoring the important question of how a debt-laden med student could afford the best view in the nations most expensive city. Ruffalo bolted to the couch drinks heavily emoting from behind a beer can. Suddenly Witherspoon appears screeching (prettily) at him to get out of her apartment. Since she seems to be an annoying spirit rather than a useful housekeeper he largely ignores her. The two leads talk and talk at each other wandering aimlessly from apartment view to rooftop view to Nob Hill park views. San Francisco is fantastic sure but scenery alone cant carry a movie if a director insists on placing two yapping humans in every frame. When Ruffalo and Witherspoon resort to mimicking each other like schoolchildren - no offense to schoolchildren - heaven looks just like the nearest exit. Witherspoon is winning raves for her portrayal of June Carter Cash in the upcoming Cash family bio-pic ""Walk the Line."" Thats the kind of movie about recently departed spirits that can stir her deep talent. People let Reese be bad. Or at least somewhere less than nice.

FACT BOXJust Like Heaven Starring Reese Witherspoon Mark Ruffalo Jon Heder Donal Logue Dina Waters Directed by Mark Waters Screenplay by Peter Tolan Leslie Dixon Studio Dreamworks YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Reese Witherspoon or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- ""Just Like Heaven"" could draw comparisons to the wildly successful 1990 film ""Ghost."" But unlike that sometimes overwrought life-and-death flick ""Heaven"" leans more -- much more -- towards laughter.""Heaven"" does have its sentimental moments but it could be best described as sharing the same comedic spirit as ""Topper"" a 1937 screwball comedy starring Cary Grant.Mark Ruffalo plays David a recent widower who has sublet a San Francisco apartment and retreated there to nurse his damaged soul. Reese Witherspoon portrays Elizabeth an overachieving workaholic doctor who immediately after obtaining a longed-for promotion is hit by a truck while on her way to a dinner party at her sister Abbys home.Shortly after David moves in -- and much to his surprise and growing annoyance -- Elizabeth starts popping up in his new home. The apartment of course just happens to have been Elizabeths before her accident.At first David assumes hes lost his mind but slowly comes to the realization that Elizabeth is a spirit who needs help in crossing over to the other side. Elizabeth on the other hand is equally convinced that shes still alive and has no intentions of going anywhere. As in any number of other films with similar plots only David can see and communicate with Elizabeths spirit; her physical form is in a coma at a local hospital.As the strong-willed Elizabeth gradually accepts her surreal situation ""Just Like Heaven"" makes the most of its comic promise thanks to a terrific script by Peter Tolan and Leslie Dixon (adapted from a French novel ""If It Were Only True"" by Marc Levy) -- and the performances of its two leads.Humor and timingWitherspoon carries the story in the beginning. Shes not only beautiful and sexy but also possesses an innate intelligence -- which makes her completely believable as a doctor. Thats not always the case in Hollywood.Ruffalo a talented actor best known for more serious roles (""You Can Count on Me"" ""In the Cut"") has a wonderful gift for deadpan timing and is also highly adept at physical comedy. His character is also more rounded than the men who usually play second fiddle to the female lead in this type of romantic comedy. ""Napoleon Dynamites"" Jon Heder plays a bookstore employee who helps Ruffalos character. Both David and Elizabeth are lost souls unable to go forward in their respective lives He cant let go of the past and she cant find her future. When they find common ground they have to race the clock to secure the only chance Elizabeth has for returning to her former life.Director Mark Waters (""Mean Girls"" ""Freaky Friday"") keeps the proceedings rolling at a breezy clip.""Just Like Heaven"" is light pleasing and well worth seeing. Sure the story has its sappy moments but the two leads and a fine cast of supporting players will make you overlook any faults it may contain. For the most part it lives up to its title.

"Witherspoon and Ruffalos teamwork cant lift Heaven - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Witherspoon and Ruffalos teamwork cant lift Heaven By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  September 16 2005 Quick A loved one is in a deep coma. What to do? You could obey the living will. Or were you inclined to think like a Hollywood movie you could sublet her apartment wait for her spirit to show up and fall in love with the new tenant then ask said spirit what it wants.If this spirit is a smidgen like Reese Witherspoons in the new romantic comedy Just Like Heaven"" the answer will almost certainly be I want to live"" Directed by Mark Waters (Mean Girls"") the movie wants all you girls to know that should medical misfortune come your way just hold on. Your soul will find your soul mate then love will set you free.Witherspoon plays Elizabeth a meticulous go-getter physician in San Francisco. When shes not saving lives during 26-hour rotations Elizabeth is stealing catnaps in the staff lounge dreaming shes in a vast softly lit Eden that could be mistaken for a Sarah McLachlan video. The women doctors in relationships speak to her in sighs (Youre so lucky that all you have to worry about is work"") as though her singleness has made her disabled. All her sister (Dina Waters) wants her to do is get a man which Elizabeth is about to do when a truck hits her.Mark Ruffalo is David the sad-sack widower who moves into Elizabeths gorgeous apartment after her accident. In no time he turns her Pottery Barn into a frat house so unkempt that Elizabeth comes all the way from limbo to insist he spruce up the place. What Elizabeth doesnt know is that shes an apparition. Davids not sure either. Drunk and depressed he hires ghost-busters and an exorcist in a futile attempt to get rid of her. Eventually Jon Heder (of Napoleon Dynamite"" fame) playing an occult bookseller with a sixth sense is called in to confirm that Elizabeth is not a figment of Davids loneliness. Shes a lost soul who doesnt remember who she is. And the movie concocts shenanigans as she and David try to figure out who she was.Ruffalo seems stuck in gimmicky romances having gamely agreed to love the 13-year-old trapped in Jennifer Garners body in 13 Going on 30"" Gwyneth Paltrows flight attendant in View From the Top"" and Jennifer Aniston as the possible daughter of the lovers in The Graduate"" in the upcoming Rumor Has It."" He can be a fierce actor but in comedies hes not a leading man hes a puppy. Yet he and Witherspoon demonstrate screwball-comedy teamwork with him providing the laid-back bafflement and her bringing the pluck.Her zip is contagious which is why none of the disdainful testimonials from Elizabeths co-workers and neighbors accusing her of being a one-track-mind drip seems accurate. Elizabeth is sociable supportive kind and above all played by Reese Witherspoon. But the movie is determined to make this woman out to be a soulless climber who cared too much about her career and must be set straight. (I dont know many 30-ish doctors who are encouraged to have time for much else.)Nonetheless Just Like Heaven"" suggests that a post-coma Elizabeth might understand what life is truly all about. Of course if being alive means having to live in this movie maybe she was better off the way she was. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

Sounds great like a welcome revival of Albert Brooks at heavens gate in the uproarious Defending Your Life. Ghost story Jon Heder makes a point to Mark Ruffalo under the gaze of Reese Witherspoon who may or may not be there. DreamWorks Pictures But instead we get Just Like Heaven with Reese Witherspoon a star the producers arent likely to kill when her pert facial features dominate the poster art. But its OK to thrust her into a prolonged coma. At its most frenetic Heaven recalls some of the more unbridled episodes from the TV ghost farce Topper before it relaxes into a tolerable effort somewhere around the midway point. This is after weve gotten more acclimated to seeing co-star Mark Ruffalo -- who is more identified with smart movies such as You Can Count on Me or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind-- looking positively mortified to be trapped in what sometimes borders on sit-com slapstick. It figures the young widower he plays would be depressed but Ruffalo looks like a Little Leaguer who has been dragged with mom to the gynecologist. (Related story Ruffalo ascends to the next level in Heaven) About the movie Just Like Heaven   1/2 (out of four) Stars Reese Witherspoon Mark Ruffalo Donal Logue Jon Heder Dina Waters Ben Shenkman Director Mark Waters Distributor DreamWorks Rating PG-13 for some sexual content Running time 1 hour 35 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Witherspoon is a workaholic ER doctor who lives in what must be a budget-stretching San Francisco apartment with a perfect aquatic view. Ruffalo who doesnt seem to have much cash coming in is able to sublet it thanks to her extended comatose state. But this doesnt prevent Witherspoons edgy spirit from showing up and demanding to know what hes doing there. Or to complain about the beer-can ring he has left on her coffee table. This is an extreme variation on what screenwriters used to call ""meeting cute"" -- and by this time youll know whether you want to bail. Ruffalo can see this apparition but no one else can and much of the comedy this hook generates is expendable. But supernatural romance is more appealing and a subsequent plot twist that threatens this (which is both logical and from a storytelling point of view clever) gets the movie onto a slightly higher plane. Reese is buttercup-cute and has enough star power to remain likable even when her character is acting snitty. Garnering a chuckle or two but no more are Donal Logue from The Tao of Steve (now theres a comedy) -- and as a desperate magnet for both the slacker and ""dude"" demographics Jon Heder from Napoleon Dynamite. The director is Mark Waters who after delivering two consecutive movies that were better than expected (Freaky Friday Mean Girls) has pretty well delivered just what young PG-13 girls carrying that extra pack of Kleenex will expect. In any event better a coma than Legally Blonde 3.

"Just Like Heaven | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; just-like-heaven ) Just Like Heaven (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli With Just Like Heaven director Mark Waters (Mean Girls) wants to have his cake and eat it to. Thats not necessarily a bad thing until you consider that the recipe used for this confection is missing a few ingredients and the final product is half-baked. And rather than eating it he kind of chokes on it. Just Like Heaven tries to be an unholy union of Ghost and All of Me and the result is rarely humorous rarely romantic and rarely affecting. Plus the suspension of disbelief curve is so steep that even Lance Armstrong wouldnt be able to make it to the top. Just Like Heaven is supposed to be a ghost story but not of the kind that are popular with horror audiences. Elizabeth Martinson (Reese Witherspoon) is a hard-working doctor who puts in 26-hour days while subsisting primarily on coffee. One rainy night on the way home from the hospital her car has a head-on encounter with a truck. When next we meet Elizabeth shes a spirit haunting her old apartment which is now occupied by David Abbott (Mark Ruffalo) a morose man who always has a beer in one hand. Eventually David comes to realize that Elizabeth is a ghost and Elizabeth acknowledges that she might no longer be amongst the living. The two team up to discover (1) what happened to Elizabeth and (2) why David is the only one who can see her. The movie starts cheating the audience early and never lets up. It finds a contrived way to get around the problem of a romance between a human and a spirit then keeps the cheap twists coming. Theres no internal logic. Elizabeth cant touch a telephone but when she lies on a bed her head makes an indentation in a pillow. The ghostly rules in this movie are changed and warped as it suits the filmmakers. When revealed the explanation of why David can see Elizabeth makes no sense. And the final scene is the ultimate insult. In order for this film to work you have to be willing to swallow crater-sized plot holes There are a few nice individual scenes but most of what Just Like Heaven has to offer is pure pabulum. On those occasions when it goes for comedy the scenes are strident and overdone. Donal Logue has a small part as Davids best friend - hes on hand mainly for ""humorous"" one-liners. Napoleon Dynamites Jon Heder plays a stoned-out mystic. I think were expected to laugh at this character because hes played by Jon Heder. Nothing he says or does is amusing in its own right. Its as if Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo ignored the stupidity of the screenplay and did their best to convince us that theyre two people falling in love. The illusion sometimes works - usually when its just the two of them sharing a quiet moment. Based on past experience we know that Witherspoon can do this kind of movie. And adding this to 13 Going on 30 we can assume that Ruffalo understands whats needed to be a lead in a romantic comedy. Movies about supernatural relationships can be fertile ground for rich involving motion pictures. Perhaps itas the shallowness of Just Like Heavens approach that I find disappointing. Instead of playing off the strengths of the premise the filmmaking team turns those strengths into weaknesses and eviscerates the underlying idea. In appealing to the heart Just Like Heaven forgets that viewers also have minds.

A variation on a very old meet-cute theme with a touch of otherworldly romance pic will need to tap deeply into the ""Ghost"" audience given the dearth of laughs for manly men. Considerably more mushy than madcap ""Just Like Heaven"" is as uneven as the topography of its San Francisco locales but the amiable peaks mostly offset the flat stretches and valleys. A variation on a very old meet-cute theme with a touch of otherworldly romance pic will need to tap deeply into the ""Ghost"" audience given the dearth of laughs for manly men. Otherwise prospects of a robust box office life (and more likely afterlife) rely almost entirely on the warming glow of Reese Witherspoons abundant charms. Directed by Mark Waters on something of a roll coming off ""Mean Girls"" and ""Freaky Friday"" ""Heaven"" introduces Elizabeth (Witherspoon) as a driven young ER doctor whose work/personal balance is seriously out of whack. When hospital colleagues grouse about juggling such entanglements one tells her shes ""lucky that all you worry about is work."" A fast-moving truck later and shes suddenly appearing in spectral form haunting the emotionally wounded David (Mark Ruffalo) who has sublet her apartment. David it turns out is sleepwalking through life following his wifes death and after trying to convince Elizabeth that shes dead gradually begins to form an attachment to her. Pic is weakest through these early stages as the pair go about trying to discover who Elizabeth is/was and what happened to her. There are some stabs at broader comedy here -- and even wry references to the ghost(busting) of movie spirits past since David a la ""Topper"" is the only one who can see Elizabeth yielding merry mix-ups when he decides to meet his buddy Jack (Donal Logue) at the local pub. For the most part though Peter Tolan and Leslie Dixons adaptation of Marc Levys novel hews toward the melancholy propelled by the idea that David is every bit as much trapped between life and death as Elizabeth. And while its perhaps necessary to establish that anguish Ruffalos performance proves so dour initially as he wallows in depression that it leeches some of the storys vitality. Just when the movie appears moribund however the narrative comes modestly alive thanks to a reasonably clever plot twist establishing a much-needed sense of jeopardy. And as evidenced by the teenage girls who audibly sighed at the more shamelessly romantic flourishes the allure of an emotional connection that can overcome physical boundaries has a lucrative track record. The irony here is that Waters was hired primarily for his comedic gifts and delivers more pointedly on the dramatic front. Indeed the main problem is there are too few laugh-out-loud sequences for whats billed as a comedy creating something of a marketing dilemma. Witherspoon is such a winning presence as to help instill pathos in Elizabeths situation but she isnt displaying the buoyant personality that made the ""Legally Blonde"" franchise percolate. In her early encounters with David rather she comes across as something of a shrew. Fortunately the principals receive solid support in smallish roles from Logue Dina Waters as Elizabeths sister and Ivana Milicevic as Davids seductive neighbor with a disappointingly flat turn by ""Napoleon Dynamites"" Jon Heder as a half-baked occult bookstore dude from whom David solicits advice. Effects-work nicely conveys Elizabeths wraithlike predicament -- from popping up in the fridge to strolling through a table -- which keeps Witherspoon in the same outfit for much of the film. Rolfe Kent delivers a score that captures the wistful tone without being cloying. In a sense then Waters ultimately accomplishes the oldest of fairy tale tricks -- generating just enough magic to rouse a slumbering movie from its trance even if the final experience is something less than heaven.
