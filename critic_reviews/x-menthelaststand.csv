Brett (""Rush Hour"") Ratner has replaced director Bryan Singer whose movies had a richer more burnished look. Singer felt more deeply about these outcast super-human mutants using them as metaphors for any and all minorities. He savored the subtexts beneath the gaudy Marvel Comics surface lingering on the teenage angst.But if ""The Last Stand"" lacks the gravitas of Singers sagas its also free of their occasional tedium. Ratners version is friskier shallower--and more fun. The director zips through this apocalyptic tale in 105 minutes barely lingering to mourn the early death of Cyclops (James Marsden) at the hands of a resurrected Phoenix (Famke Janssen) whose telekinetic powers now surpass even those of Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen). The latter earns his knighthood by keeping a straight face while wearing a helmet and cape that would have looked cheesy on Flash Gordon.This time around the mutants face the insidious threat of a medical ""cure"" for their mutant gene. Should they assimilate? Power-mad Magneto assumes the government wants to eradicate mutants and wages war. Opposing him are Wolverine Storm Iceman et al. plus some new faces--most intriguingly the winged tortured Angel (Ben Foster) whose rich father (Michael Murphy) invented the cure. Angel is such a scene stealer its a shame that screenwriters Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg didnt give him more to do. But their script has a streamlined trajectory that the earlier movies lacked. Sillier than the Singer versions Ratners movie is also--for this less-than-reverent X-Men fan--more satisfying.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

These intrepid mutants arent going anywhere. Judging from the last eight seconds of the film the powers that be are already whipping up plans for another sequel. But if this third installment is any indication the franchise may have plunged too far into self-parody to ever fully recover. Brett Ratner (taking over from Bryan Singer) and screenwriters Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn inspired by Marvels comic books have produced a slap-happy special-effects blitz stuffed with way too many characters way too many cliches way too many gaffes. But it brings unexpected pleasure in unintended ways I was pleased to learn for instance that the Golden Gate Bridge still twinkles with lights after being ripped from its foundation and swung toward Alcatraz. There on that forbidding island mutants good and bad square off in an all-out war over anti-mutant bigotry and the invention of a ""cure."" ""Since when did we become a disease?"" asks Storm (Halle Berry) one of the X-Men or good mutants under the tutelage of the telekinetic Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart). The good X-Men are suspicious of the cure but seem committed to dialogue with the U.S. government which employs a genial furry cabinet member played by Kelsey Grammer in blueberry-shaded Planet of the Apes makeup. The bad mutants meanwhile call themselves the Brotherhood and follow Magneto (Ian McKellen) a fascistic world-conquerer who controls metal by waving his arms through the air and looking snotty. McKellen is a lovely slitherer but hes surrounded by a bunch of pouty goths who exhibit few gifts beyond an affinity for hair gel and black dominatrix netting. Underpinning the X-Men universe is a kind of radical nonconformism that celebrates individual worth -- its the Im OK Youre OK of genetically-altered hero epics. Everyone has a power Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) can recover from any wound Angel (Ben Foster) can fly Kitty (Ellen Page from Hard Candy) can walk through walls. Then we have Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) who freezes stuff and Pyro (Aaron Stanford) who throws fire. Their face-off at movies end answers the question ice boy or fire boy -- whos hotter? But some of these powers seem undesirable. Would you really want to be Rogue (Anna Paquin) who kills everyone she touches? Or that unfortunate Magneto disciple -- lets call him porcupine boy -- endowed with retractable facial quills? Much cooler talents belong to the formerly good formerly dead Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) here resurrected as an evil ultrapowerful telepath whose eyes blacken into shiny Greek olives while shes busy levitating and/or decomposing people who cross her. While engaged in this task her hair fans out and her posture stiffens Carrie-style and in this zombie stance she toys with the world. But omnipotence is such a drag. Dramatically its a dead-end street If Jean Grey can uproot buildings and vaporize folks at will theres no need for Magneto to launch burning cars at Alcatraz. As the American president frets at one point ""I worry how democracy survives when man can move cities with his mind."" Im glad he raised that subject. Oppressive overkill can suck the life from any hallowed institution.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post The first sign that ""X-Men The Last Stand"" is a silly disappointment compared with its predecessors is our first gander at Kelsey Grammer as the blue-tinted Beast. Grammer looks like Chewbacca after losing a throwdown with a giant Sharpie. It doesnt help that Grammers version of Beast is about as lethal as Frasier Crane in a bar fight. We joke because we care and the problem is the hair cracks just keep on coming. Storm (Halle Berry) shows up in her third do in the three-part series proving that if you dont like mutant weather wait five minutes and call your stylist. Storm and Beast even comment on each others newly shorn manes as if the next global confrontation over rogue DNA was scheduled for a Beverly Hills salon. Superhero movies have to manage that superhuman trick of happy kinetics and loose energy. They should offer a few laughs - its still men in tights after all or at least tight leather Wolverine pants - but must take themselves seriously enough to justify 150 million in ludicrous outfits. The first Xs under Bryan Singer flew that route beautifully posing serious and ever-more- relevant questions about aliens among us while creating a likeable family of genetic rejects. Brett Ratners ""XIII"" seems like a junior varsity version in desperate need of Singers more seasoned perspective. The three-quel is a talky D(N)a Vinci Code devoid of pacing and rife with inside jokes. X directors need to get away from their alma mater the Xavier School for the Gifted. The precious kids with their levitating paper airplanes and genetically challenged crushes have grown stale yet Ratner tries to make it an American Hogwarts. These choices culminate in one of the most questionable cinematic ice skating scenes since Kong stuck that triple salchow in Central Park. As ""XIII"" opens Cyclops (James Marsden) is crying his eye out over the apparent ""X2"" death of hottie Dr. Jean Gray (Famke Janssen). Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) also loved the psychic-psycho doc before she was buried under a lake in Canada and the two macho X-ers for a moment threaten to go all Brokeback Mutant on us. On to bigger ideas Researchers holed up on Alcatraz Island have discovered a ""cure"" for mutant human genes. Will government leaders require all mutants to get shots and go ""normal""? Will Magneto (Ian Mc- Kellen) again use his evil means to justify his end of defending mutant rights? Can Storms new haircut make Halle Berry a better actress? Will Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) reappear in that painted-on body suit or is she too busy opening the new Cirque de Soleil show in Vegas? The cure-no-cure plot holds initial promise as we see a young boy desperately trying to file off budding angel wings in his parents bathroom. The horror of feeling different was never so succinctly portrayed in the first two ""Xs."" But Ratner loses the power of this scene to the blandly laughable screenplay of Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg. ""If he wants a war well give him one"" ""Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"" ""Scotts a changed man"" Well duh - arent they all? The expensive special-effects sequences seem ill-conceived and pasted in. Magneto moves the entire Golden Gate Bridge just so he can walk to Alcatraz - last time I checked there was a cheap ferry ride. During the ultimate fight scene Storm decides to introduce San Francisco to the overpowering force of - fog. Meanwhile characters spend countless moments coming or going or talking about whether its the right time to be coming or going. Apparently the gene for decisiveness died out in a world of 500 cable channels. ""XIII"" leaves enough winking cliffhangers to guarantee someone other than Ratner will have a chance to mutate things back toward progress. Be ready for ""XIVAmnesty"" ""XVGreen Card"" and ""XVIThe Really Big Wall."" Theres no stopping the invasion of X movies even when they take work away from better films.

"X-Men The Last Stand | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; x-men-the-last-stand ) X-Men The Last Stand (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli For X-Men viewers this is probably as straightforward as it gets if you liked the first two youre likely to appreciate the third. X-Men The Last Stand isnt as taut or satisfying as X-Men 2 but its better constructed and better paced than the original X-Men. The differences in quality between the three are minor however; and despite the change in directors (Brett Ratner replacing Bryan Singer who bolted to helm Superman Returns) there seems to be a single vision. X-Men The Last Stand is the first blockbuster of the 2006 summer season that hasnt caused me to shake my head with disappointment. It delivers pretty much whats expected. It should be noted that X-Men The Last Stand diverges significantly from its comic book source material so that may result in issues for die hard fans. Those expecting the ""Dark Phoenix"" saga to be replicated on screen are in for an unpleasant 104 minutes. X-Men The Last Stand uses the ""Dark Phoenix"" premise for an aspect of the film but it doesnt unfold the way it did on the printed page. Some people are going to be offended by this. But the movies are taking a different road. They should be allowed to do so and be judged on the merits of that detour. Once again at the core of the story lies the conflict between humans and mutants. Human scientists have discovered a way to ""suppress the mutant gene"" effectively turning mutants into human beings - permanently. The mutant community is divided about this. There are those like Rogue (Anna Paquin) who see this as an opportunity to shed powers that have become a burden. Others like Magneto (Ian McKellen) view this as an attempt at (human) racial cleansing. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his X-Men initially sit on the sidelines urging caution and tolerance in the face of a growing firestorm. Magneto however rallies an army with the intention of thwarting the would-be genocide and taking the battle to the humans. But theres a wrinkle. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has returned from the dead but shes no longer the rational woman she once was. Now shes the Phoenix a creature of appetite and almost limitless power and she has elected to side with Magneto. Even the combined powers of Storm (Halle Berry) Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) Beast (Kelsey Grammer) and the others may not be enough to touch - let alone stop - her. Theres a lot going on in this film - too much really especially considering that it clocks in at well under two hours. This leads to a cramped rushed feeling. The stories and relationships are not given time to breathe. Those expecting character development wont find much here - this film is more about sustaining momentum. Theres a sense that the material jammed into this movie might have made a great epic-length feature. X-Men The Last Stand gives us most of the X-Men we have grown to know over three movies (Professor X Cyclops Storm Wolverine Iceman Rogue Jean Grey) returning mutants with bigger roles (Kitty Pryde Pyro Colossus) and newcomers (Angel Beast Juggernaut). It poses ethical questions about genetics and race. There are some great action sequences and impressive special effects (including a flashback de-aging of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen which is remarkable). There are moments of low-key humor and understated pathos (the movie does not try for manipulation during its tragedies). Too many characters is a problem. At times it feels like theyre fighting for screen time. Storms role has been beefed up to accommodate Halle Berrys desire to be more Snow White than one of the seven dwarves but all this does is give us a greater opportunity to reflect upon how badly she is miscast. Wolverine isnt as prominent as in the previous installments but he still has his share of memorable moments and corrosive one-liners. The losers are Professor X Cyclops and Rogue - three veterans whose individual screen times dont run into the double digits. Ellen Page (Hard Candy) becomes the third actress to play Kitty Pryde although I doubt anyone but her two predecessors noticed the change. Kelsey Grammer is a nice addition joining the blue-skinned brigade (Alan Cummings Nightcrawler is absent but Rebecca Romijns Mystique is still around). Ian McKellen is as delightful as ever and as the Phoenix Famke Janssen provides an opponent truly worthy of the X-Men. Rush Hour director Brett Ratner picks up where Bryan Singer left off. The transition is seamless. In fact anyone unaware of the change at the top might not recognize that one has occurred. Ratner does nothing to call attention to himself. Based on what shows up on screen it would seem that his vilification in some fan circles has been unwarranted. His presence behind the camera has not ""ruined"" the X-Men franchise. Instead he has provided an entertaining episode that offers a sense of closure if not complete satisfaction (theres too little emotional resonance for that). X-Men The Last Stand provides a post credit sequence (of about 20 seconds) for those who want to stay. My advice however is to leave as soon as the credits start rolling. The movie works better without this scene and it could be argued that this is the films biggest misstep. I wish I hadnt hung around to see it and I think most who miss it will have a better overall opinion of the film than those who stick it out. It doesnt play fair with the audience and cheapens one of the films most poignant elements. Its hard to say whether or not there will be more X-Men movies. The groundwork has been laid for additional sequels but there undoubtedly will be changes and one suspects that if there is a fourth installment few of the original mutants will be on board. Its hard to imagine Halle Berry Patrick Stewart Anna Paquin or Hugh Jackman returning (although the latter may get his own spin-off movie). If this is the send-off for the ""first team"" its a successful one with enough moments of greatness to compensate for the ones that arent so great.

If the movie is a big hit - not a certainty in a summer of underperforming blockbusters like ""Poseidon"" and ""Mission Impossible III"" - you can be sure there will be spinoffs like ""Wolverine The Prequel"" or ""Magneto The Early Years.""Not being an ""X-Men"" freak Im probably not in the best position to determine whether the franchise deserves another go-round. I enjoyed the first film in the series tolerated the second - both were directed by Bryan Singer - and had a reasonably good time at the third which was directed by Brett Ratner (""Rush Hour"").Singer was supposed to direct it but then - horrors - he defected to the new ""Superman."" At one time Ratner was going to direct Superman so I guess he and Singer have each other to thank for their current predicament. Ratner is a much more by-the-book director than Singer. Things grind to a screeching halt whenever the action slows and the actors expostulate the exposition. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? All the usual suspects reappear. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is still having a bad hair day; Storm (Halle Berry) gets to fly this time; Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) sits enthroned in his wheelchair; Magneto (Ian McKellen) continues to wear that really silly Captain Video helmet; Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) is alluring in metamorphic basic blue. Rogue (Anna Paquin) is still stuck in a rut - shes a touchy-feely girl who can neither touch nor feel without lethal consequence. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) has come back from the dead a changed - i.e. really really bad - woman. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 A few new faces turn up among them Juggernaut (footballer Vinnie Jones) a human boulder-in-motion; and Beast (Kelsey Grammer) the big blue furball hulk who serves the president as secretary of mutant affairs.In the case of the X-Men its not true to say that if youve seen one mutant youve seen them all. The one abiding pleasure of the series is seeing a lot of mutants strut their stuff. The more the merrier. Not to get too high-toned here but I think one reason the film series as well as the ""X-Men"" Marvel Comics are so popular with young people is because of its central metaphor. From Superman and Batman on down quite a few superhero or antihero comic figures have led double lives and this split appeals particularly to teenagers still experimenting with who they are. The mutants in ""X-Men"" are an exaggerated version of this split Not only do they have superhuman powers but they are vilified by humans for having them.In ""The Last Stand"" the metaphor is intensified because a cure has been developed for mutancy and suddenly a decision must be made stay as you are or become ""normal."" Magneto leads the charge against the powers of normalcy by annexing the Mutant Brotherhood and intoning in his plummiest Shakespearean tones ""Nobody is going to cure us. We are the cure."" He even goes as far as to hijack the Golden Gate Bridge and literally stretch it across the bay to Alcatraz Island where the cure is being held. He does all this however while still wearing that silly headpiece.I suppose its asking too much of Ratner to impart some kind of visionary flourish to the proceedings. But without it these comic-book movies all tend to look the same. The ""heart"" of the story - the choice these mutants must make about their mutancy - rarely comes into play.Except for Rogue of course who wants to be human so she can win over Iceman and make out with him. Seems like a good enough reason to me. Grade B- Rated PG-13 for sequences of action violence sexual content and language.

Comments X-Men The Last Stand Bryan Singer who directed the first two X-Men movies jumped ship to do Superman Returns taking most of the production team with him and leaving this third (and purportedly final) installment to Brett Ratner (Rush Hour Red Dragon). Despite all the grand gestures of climax and resolution theres a pronounced sense of autopilot; the only person who seems to be having a good time is Ian McKellen as the scheming Magneto. With Hugh Jackman Halle Berry Famke Janssen Anna Paquin and Patrick Stewart; Kelsey Grammer joins the franchise as the blue-furred geneticist Dr. Hank McCoy--sort of a cross between Henry Kissinger and the Cookie Monster.

X-Men morph from moody to just angry - USATODAY.com SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Movies Cars  Event tickets   Jobs Real estate  Shop   Online degrees X-MEN THE LAST STANDReview Third film is slicker but lacks soulA love boat for X-Men castFans embrace new director X-Men morph from moody to just angry Posted 5/24/2006 1129 PM ET E-mail | Print | By Claudia Puig USA TODAY X-Men The Last Stand (  1/2 out of four) expands on the themes of discrimination and alienation explored in the first two films and still retains the franchises signature kick-butt action features. It also has a couple of emotionally resonant scenes that build on the first two story lines. But it lacks the intriguing moody quality of the previous films. The mutants are more pumped up and angry this time rather than misunderstood and conflicted. The main characters return for a third go-round. On the side of good are Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) Storm (Halle Berry) Rogue (Anna Paquin) Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). On the dark side Ian McKellen reprises his role as the steely Magneto and Rebecca Romijn returns as Mystique the shape-shifter. A new and very blue face is that of Kelsey Grammer as Dr. Henry McCoy/Beast a hirsute geneticist whose stuffed-shirt performance seems a bit jarring with the rest of the tough X-Men. Another new character Angel (Ben Foster) plays a barely significant role; his most interesting scene is as a little boy (Cayden Boyd) attempting to saw off his wings. The conflict between conformity and embracing ones uniqueness is further examined as Angels doctor father (Michael Murphy) develops a cure for mutations. This kicks off a war between men and mutants. The mutant side is spearheaded by Magneto who as a child saw his parents dragged off to a concentration camp because they were different from the ruling party. Magneto and his former friend the professor tangle once again. Magneto resents the ruling humans attempts to control mutants and espouses violence while the professor favors reasoned calm and understanding. But it is an unexpected battle between the professor and a former student that comes as the big shocker. Most astonishing visually is a scene in which the Golden Gate Bridge is dramatically dismantled by the powerful Magneto. Director Brett Ratner seems to have a way of blending eye-popping special effects and ambitious action sequences with drama but dont expect depth and subtlety. He has a more mainstream sensibility so this film is slicker with more splashy effects but you miss the brooding quality of the last two directed by Bryan Singer. The ending seems to leave things open for a fourth installment. Perhaps studios should think twice before calling a movie The Last Stand until they decide with certainty that it is indeed the final entry. (In some theaters at midnight tonight. Running time 1 hour 44 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence some sexual content and language.)

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 25 2006 426 PM Death to X-Men A sequel only a mutant could love. By Michael Agger Halle Berry and Hugh Jackman in X-MenThe Last Stand Mirror mirror on the wall whats the most gay-friendly blockbuster series of them all? No not Batman. And not The Lord of the Rings (which is more pre-sexual than anything else). Consider another series one in which teenagers discover that they are ""mutants"" and long to run away from home and be with others like them. At a finishing school in the countryside they learn to wear tight leather suits and follow Hugh Jackman. Plus if you touch the hottest girl at the school (Anna Paquin) you die. Consider also that the director of X-Men Bryan Singer stages scenes in which the word mutant is an obvious stand-in for homosexual--most famously in X2 when a mother asks her son ""Have you ever tried ... not being a mutant?"" Now imagine what happens when this beloved franchise is turned over to Brett Ratner the reigning Mr. Testosterone of Hollywood. The third installment X-Men The Last Stand (Fox) takes what had been a fun mixture of swish eye candy and political metaphor and turns it into a thundering lovers saga involving Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and a reborn Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Too bad since the movies setup is sharp A ""cure"" for the mutant gene has been developed giving mutants everywhere the chance to become ""normal"" again. There are scenes outside the cure centers that recall the protests outside abortion clinics. Indeed the X-Men movies have always played with volatile cultural material. The mutants represent the next stage of human evolution (homo sapiens superior) a fact that brings up all sorts of uncomfortable notions of eugenics and racial superiority. Singer was fond of having his characters speculate on the best use of their superpowers as if they were the United States. Ratner doesnt explore any of this. Hes too busy blowing stuff up and trying to please the fan boys.Yes those superpowerful fan boys. Singer may have accentuated the homoerotic notes of X-Men but the comics enduring appeal is its embrace of all varieties of alienation. In the 1980s X-Men represented an absorbing alternative to the squareness of Superman and team sports. I speak from experience. A lot of teenagers who for whatever reason felt like outsiders loved the X-Men (especially Wolverine). Now weve grown up and weve become a choice audience that Hollywood courts. Theres just one problem These characters have lived in our minds for months or years and to see them on-screen is inevitably a minor letdown. My heart leapt up when I saw Kelsey Grammer appear as the old-school mutant Beast but I also felt pandered to. It was as if Ratner was saying ""Heres your little furry friend geek now excuse me while I take this call from my Polish supermodel girlfriend."" Advertisement Theres no artistic motive for X-Men The Last Stand to exist and it shows. When Singer (and his initial replacement) walked away from the franchise 20th Century Fox signed up Ratner only weeks before the start of shooting in the hope of squeezing more juice from the lemon. The cast has the contented air of someone who just found 20 bucks on the sidewalk. The lone exception is Rebecca Romijn whose character appears in a skin-fitting blue rubber suit that must take hours to apply. She just looks pissed. The best parts of comic-book movies are always the back story the tender moments of teenage solitude when the hero discovers that he or she is special and different. They defeat the bully or save their crush and everything is still human-scaled and believable. But by the time the characters have mastered their special powers the movies become a) CGI video games b) overwrought melodrama c) physically ludicrous. (Think of the second half of Spider-man.) In X-Men Magneto (Ian McKellen) can control metal whereas Wolverine (Jackman) has a metal skeleton and the ability to heal instantly. You would think that Magneto could defeat Wolverine but no in the painful logic of these movies such an obvious thing never happens. When I saw a Latina mutant (Dania Ramirez) arrive on-screen however I knew without fail that she would fight the only other mutant woman of color in the film Halle Berry. It wont spoil anything to say that Ratner ends the movie with a literal kiss of death. Which is fitting since theres only one place left for this series to go a prequel. And even though X-Men The Last Stand is an uninspired hodgepodge its not as if the movie has no redeeming qualities. I came away impressed with the mutant power of Brett Ratner. We should strategically deploy him to destroy runaway movie franchises that threaten mankind with their continued existence. For starters is it too much to ask to sic him on Garfields A Tale of Two Kitties? Michael Agger is an editor at The New Yorker. Follow him on Twitter.

Once again they have to decide whether to be like the rest of us -- or continue blowing things up. 1 / 6 Back to Gallery X-Men The Last Stand Action. Starring Hugh Jackman Patrick Stewart Halle Berry Ian McKellen and Famke Janssen. Directed by Brett Ratner. (PG-13. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The new X-Men movie is called ""The Last Stand"" and lets hope they mean it. This is the third film in the series which means that on three occasions now weve been presented with the same story featuring the same conflict leading to the same false resolution a smiley-happy joining of hands at the edge of an abyss. At what point do the people in the movie -- not to mention the filmmakers -- catch on that mutants and Homo sapiens not only cant get along but shouldnt get along not if Homo sapiens hope to be around past next Tuesday? ""The Last Stand"" follows the pattern of the other ""X-Men"" films. There are a few terse conversations followed by explosions followed by Halle Berry causing a storm followed by Hugh Jackman sprouting blades from his knuckles followed by Famke Janssen killing people by thinking about it etc. In between we see Patrick Stewart looking worried. Why? Is it because he has to play scenes opposite Ian McKellen and McKellen would upstage his own grandmother? No its because Stewart plays Charles Xavier a visionary mutant who dreams of world peace and harmony even though every day mutants are being born who can blow you up by looking at you. Charles the supposed saint of the series is one naive fellow. If the above recipe puts the tune of ""Thats Entertainment"" in your ears then ""The Last Stand"" is your movie. But for everyone else this is another video game-like action picture based on a comic book series almost as mindless as ""Fantastic Four"" but more annoying in that this one has philosophical pretensions. The pretensions take the form of the central metaphor that compares mutants to people of extraordinary groundbreaking talent. That metaphor is bogus. Like the previous ""X-Men"" ""The Last Stand"" takes place at a time in the near future when nature preparing for the next step in human evolution is producing an unusual number of mutants with exceptional powers. Some can mind read. Some can shape shift. Some can sprout giant wings and fly. Some can do things with metal. Others can do things with fire or ice. In most cases these powers have the potential for extraordinary destruction. Not surprisingly the presence of these mutants causes great fear and consternation on the part of the Homo sapiens (the majority) and threatens to destabilize society. The metaphor here is the clash between special talent (the mutants) and conformity (everybody else). But its one thing for people to react with hostility toward someone who writes an incendiary novel. Its quite another for people to react in this way toward someone who can set their heads on fire. The first reaction is intolerance. The second is simply the genuine recognition of a threat and the beginning of self-preservation. The vision at the heart of ""X-Men"" -- of a golden Utopia in which humans live side by side with mutants -- is absurd. It requires that mutants never get mad ever and that humans never even have to worry that they might. But hasnt anybody ever heard of road rage? ""The Last Stand"" is a cut above the previous two ""X-Men"" movies in that it comes up with an arresting premise A scientist has developed a formula to turn mutants into normal human beings. The cure is irreversible. Whats more the U.S. government has done something considered despicable in the movie but is actually rather brilliant. Theyve weaponized the cure. The militarys guns no longer shoot bullets but darts containing the cure. The existence of the cure upends an already shaky societal balance. Some mutants want the cure mutant activists protest the cure and the militant mutant Magneto (McKellen) wants to start a war over it seeing this as the beginning of his peoples destruction. Xavier the saintly founder of the X-Men thinks all this intolerance is unnecessary but if you actually stand back and examine the situation (which the movie never does) its clear that Magneto and the anti-mutant extremists are right. After all if Xaviers moderate course is right why after three movies are there less than 10 X-Men? Obviously his dream is not where the future is heading. McKellen is fun as always -- this time in order to top himself he almost sings his lines. Theres a striking sequence involving the Golden Gate Bridge which jazzes up the evening commute and the new gimmick of the ""cure"" gun provides for some interesting moments of transformation. But for the most part this is just noisy and busy and when its not its grim and self-important. Jackman as Wolverine gets the worst of it His searing emotional scenes with the telekinetic Jean (Janssen) provide the movies only laughs. -- Advisory Explosions and sexual situations culminating in physical death.

With only minor tweaking this comic-book concept - people with superpowers resulting from genetic anomalies rendering them both evolutionary pioneers and social pariahs - can be roughly applied to any number of real-world concerns from racism to homophobia the generation gap to the war on terror. The development of a weaponised cure for mutants in this third outing expands the field to the US culture wars around the human body evoking HIV the right to choose and body fascism at its most literal. But while director Brett Ratner offers a serviceable approximation of his predecessor Bryan Singers steely style - with several arresting action set-pieces including a grand-scale San Francisco Bay finale - a tighter focus might have enhanced the set-ups latent allegorical powers and its emotional resonance.Following X2 Scott Cyclops Summers (James Marsden) is inconsolable (ie unshaven) over the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who promptly reappears as Phoenix a stolid yet near-omnipotent succubus with varicose veins. Battle for control of her powers sets the assimilationist X-Men of saintly headmastermind Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) against the disaffected troops of rabble-rousing Magneto (Ian McKellen). The overabundance of characters works against engagement a couple of regulars are bumped off but few of the numerous new faces put in more than token appearances (exceptions are Kelsey Grammer as an urbane blue sasquatch and regrettably Vinnie Jones as an armour-plated thug). Most intriguing by far is the testy rapport between Stewart and McKellen visiting Jeans childhood home in a flashback prologue they are youthful - or at least weirdly shiny-faced - colleagues; meeting there again decades on they snipe at each others overfamiliar foibles like a couple of bickering old queens.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Oh Jesus How Ron Howard desecrated The Da Vinci Code while the X-Men franchise survived Brett Ratner. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis Illustration by Wes Duvall  (Photo Simon Mein/Courtesy of Sony Pictures) Dan Browns pointy-headed potboiler The Da Vinci Code might actually be the threat to Christianity that its critics claim but there are many threats out thereamong them works by Deist scholars that speculate authoritatively on the multiple human authors and extra-divine political intentions of the New (and for that matter Old) Testament. Where Brown ups the ante is in spinning a matriarchal counter-theology that borders on pagan goddess-worship and in making the reactionary-Catholic Opus Dei sect a bastion of homicidal zealots. Throw in car chases gory murders skulking bishops a mysterious criminal mastermind a self-flagellating killer albino papyri in booby-trapped vials and cryptogrammatic clues in masterpieces of Western art and youve got yourself a publishing phenomenon that even a lot of churchgoers cant resist. The divinely uninspired adaptation by director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman makes little of all this The movie is a Shaggy Grail story without a whisper of passionnot even the passion for intellectual gamesmanship that buttressed the glop in the pairs A Beautiful Mind. Given the furor surrounding its opening The Da Vinci Code is an embarrassing nonevent. You can imagine Catholic leaders emerging from cinemas and telling their picketers to go home. For a start (and a finish) Browns subversive thrust has been softened. In the book its presented as fact that Jesus wasnt divine He was merely a major prophet until the emperor Constantine came along in the fourth century andto shore up his own powerreorchestrated the religion around the whole Son of God thing. In the film thats just a theoryand more important a theory disputed by the nice-guy hero and famed symbologist Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks). To clinch the deal its proponent is an eccentric semi-invalid called Sir Leigh Teabing a sodomite moniker if ever there was one and played by an extra-fruity Sir Ian McKellen. Now really Whose side would you be on? After an Opus Dei bishop (Alfred Molina) fingers Langdon for the murder of a Louvre curator the symbologist and the French police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou) follow the dead heretics fancy clues in search of a secret that could transform the modern world. Their trek should at least produce some juicy set-pieces Think what a haunted Catholic like Alfred Hitchcock would have made of this material. But Goldsman brings nothingnot even shameless Hollywood religiosityto the party. Was the screenwriter so worried hed be the target of anti-Semitic fusillades that he kept The Da Vinci Code at arms length? Maybe the job should have gone to a Catholic writer who would have identified with and preserved Browns wise-ass-altar-boy tone because without it theres nothing left except generic thriller devices and a director too timid to give those a charge. Howard cant even make something of what should have been a breathtaking murder scene the Louvre at night. He blurs the backgrounds. I felt sympathy for Hanks. This is obviously a money job but its probably no fun for an actor with his smarts when theres nothing to playno subtext no strong objective and no characters of stature to go up against. Hes upstaged by his suit (a trim charcoal number). Pretty though she is Audrey Tautou is a bigger washout. A textbook gamine (the text being Amelie) she seems bred for airy enchantment not earthy gumption and her very approximate English turns even rudimentary dialogue into a linguistic adventure. She was obviously cast because the script said French girl and the studio execs said Call Tautous agentthe way the script said French cap-i-tain and the execs said Call the Godzilla guys agent Jean Reno. Another bad call was casting the pale blond Englishman Paul Bettany as the demented albino Silas. Hes a fine actor but hes slender and diffident; he has to work too hard to convey the volcanic inner life thats meant as a counterpoint to the abominable-snowman exterior. If theres anything to be learned from this dud its that when you adapt an explosive property like The Da Vinci Code playing it safe isnt safe Either swallow hard and make the damnable thing or give it to someone with more guts and/or less to lose. Here is a saga that bombards the very foundations of Western religion. But onscreen there seems to be absolutely nothing at stake. 1 2 Next Share this story...

The third times not the charm in ""X-Men The Last Stand."" Taking over the reins from Bryan Singer helmer Brett Ratner delivers a wham-bam sequel noticeably lacking in the pop gravitas moody atmospherics and emotional weight that made the first two Marvel comicbook adaptations so rousingly successful. Robust action the usual top-of-the-line visual effects and massive fan-ticipation worldwide all but guarantee a super-powered opening when 20th Century Fox releases the pic May 26 though less-than-Marvelous repeat biz means ""Stands"" legs may fall short of the 405 million grossed internationally by ""X2 X-Men United."" Ancillary biz will be appreciably huge. Taken as a trilogy (despite the door being left open inevitably for an ""X4"") the ""X-Men"" pics most closely resemble the original ""Star Wars"" movies in their qualitative trajectory. Just as the second film in each instance repped a substantial elaboration of its predecessors storytelling visual richness and thematic depth so ""X-Men The Last Stand"" suffers from the same coarsened writing diminished imagination and occasional bursts of self-parody that plagued ""Return of the Jedi."" The result though it delivers only in fits and starts is still sharper and more inventive than most comicbook-adapted fare and eventually gets the job done as far as action buffs are concerned. But dont expect pic to win any new converts or satiate those fans for whom the pleasures of the franchise went beyond the purely visceral. Thats a shame considering the tale cooked up by scribes Zak Penn (who collaborated on ""X2"") and Simon Kinberg plus the portentous title will have viewers stoked for the most cataclysmic showdown yet between mankind and mutantkind. Equipped with powers as thrilling to behold as they are potentially destructive the mutant race is once again divided into two factions led respectively by the wise wheelchair-bound Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and megalomaniacal metal-controlling Magneto (Ian McKellen). Story opens 20 years before the events of the previous film when both men then allies paid a visit to a young girl named Jean Grey (Haley Ramm) and persuaded her to harness her staggering telekinetic ability.Pic then returns to the present-day setting of Professor Xaviers elite school for mutants with lupine Logan or Wolverine (Hugh Jackman as testosterone-driven as ever) and weather girl Storm (Halle Berry) serving as second in command. Scott Summers aka Cyclops (James Marsden) has been broody and out of sorts since the supposed death of girlfriend Jean (Famke Janssen) at the end of ""X2."" Dialogue early on betrays a weakness for expository quips (""Not everyone heals as fast as you Logan"") while the poignant quandary of Rogue (Anna Paquin) who cant touch b.f. Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) without sapping his life force here plays more like adolescent soap opera. Meanwhile all is not quiet on the mutant front thanks to the recent invention of an antibody that suppresses the ""X gene"" thus rendering explicit the previous pics subtext equating mutation with homosexuality. Magneto responds by mobilizing a mutant army to terrorize the public until the so-called ""cure"" is destroyed. Situation grows even more complicated with the sudden reappearance of Jean seemingly alive and well. Yet sinister psychic undercurrents lead Professor Xavier to believe Jean (chillingly played by Janssen) is in fact possessed by her fiery and ultra-powerful alter ego Phoenix. This strand of the story -- necessarily but disappointingly watered down from the comicbooks darkly compelling Phoenix saga -- should have purists in a lather. Where Singer brought a lingering resonance to even the series quietest moments Ratner seems primarily concerned with breadth and speed. (At 105 minutes pic is a half hour shorter than its predecessor.) Theres a rushed disorganized feel to the narrative which drops and picks up subplots at random and has no compunction about bumping off veteran characters while introducing a host of new ones. Most important addition to the X-Mens ranks is the peaceable Dr. Hank McCoy aka Beast (a blue-furred Kelsey Grammer) whose physical actions are almost as nimble as his intellect. Perhaps the prominence of this blue giant explains why Mystique the similarly hued shape-shifter played by Rebecca Romijn gets so little attention this time around. Past complaints that the series boasts too many personalities to be accommodated within a barely two-hour feature are right on the money here with the proliferation of new mutants like Angel (Ben Foster beautiful enough to give Emma Thompson a run for her halo) and Jimmy (Cameron Bright) a boy with the ability to dispel mutant powers. Only during the climax a huge faceoff staged at Alcatraz does pic begin to get an inventive groove on wittily exploiting the mutants various powers and playing them against each other. Yet even here the film feels at a loss to convey that anything truly momentous is at stake. Visual effects supervisor John Bruno and stunt coordinators Wade Eastwood and Mike Mitchell keep the action at a reasonably high level though without rivaling the digital polish or martial energy of ""X2."" Similarly Dante Spinottis widescreen cinematography and overall look seem brighter and flatter than their previous incarnations. Print screened at Cannes was intermittently out of focus.
