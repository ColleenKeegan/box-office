""Furry Vengeance"" tries to pass itself off as a fun family movie with a message. While the movies fun quotient for preschoolers is subject to debate there is indeed a message -- albeit not one of the tree-hugging and animal-advocating variety. Brendan Fraser plays careerist real estate developer Dan Sanders who thanklessly uproots his family from Chicago for the unwelcome greener pastures of Oregon to help his company turn reserved forestland into subdivisions. Easy peasy right? Wrong. Furry Vengeance (PG) Summit Entertainment (91 min.) Directed by Roger Kumble. With Brendan Fraser Brooke Shields Ken Jeong and Matt Prokop. Now playing in New Jersey. Martin Tsais rating One and a half stars Rating note The film contains some rude humor mild language and brief smoking. Local animals have put their heads together to conspire against his every move organizing vicious attacks ranging from staging car accidents to filling his SUV with skunks to turning a portable toilet upside down while he is inside. Meanwhile everyone else thinks he is paranoid about the animals and needs psychiatric help. Anthropomorphized animals can be a riot. Think of the English-subtitled point-of-view flashback of a chimpanzee in ""Being John Malkovich."" But ""Furry Vengeance"" brings to mind something like a live-action version of ""Looney Tunes."" Sooner or later you might be inclined to root for hapless predators like Sylvester the Cat or Wile E. Coyote because they are the underdogs and their prey are far more obnoxious than they are. That sentiment holds especially true for ""Furry Vengeance"" given that Frasers character is so agreeable and defenseless. Worse the young children who are the films target audience could easily get the impression from these creatures that wild animals dont need our protection. And the thought balloons here are just not nearly as amusing as subtitles when it comes to conveying animal communications. Latent xenophobia is evident in the head developer being an Asian man who busts Bruce Lee moves and the investor being an Indian national. This racially tinged inversion of power dynamics is absurd. The only inspired element of the film is the casts cover of hip-hop group Cypress Hills ""Insane in the Brain"" over the end credits complete with a music video featuring various pop-culture quotations such as one from ""The Blue Lagoon"" -- which is hilarious given that Haworth resident Brooke Shields is in the supporting role of Dans wife. Since the clip will probably go viral at some point you might want to skip this movie -- and go rent ""George of the Jungle"" to get your Brendan Fraser fix if you must.

BRENDAN FRASER stars in FURRY VENGEANCE. Photo Summit Entertainment Review Furry Vengeance 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Furry Vengeance J Comedy. Starring Brendan Fraser. Directed by Roger Kumble. (PG. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Furry Vengeance"" is billed as a comedy but I doubt itll make you laugh. It might however cause you to weep for Brendan Fraser whose locus of manhood - not to mention his career - takes a beating from vengeful creatures. Water. Coffee. Fangs. Power window. Peaked roof. Leech. You name it If its hot wet pointy or painful it lands in Frasers no-no zone putting this minor miserable film in a special category of PG movies that routinely mistakes crotch hits for humor. Which all-powerful arbiter of filmmaking taste decided this was funny? Perhaps we can blame a screenwriting program that inserts scenes of comic emasculation as a default mode. Or perhaps its a sadistic hazing ritual for large mild-mannered action stars. The rationale behind all the flagrant Fraser humiliation is an uprising of small but vindictive woodland fauna in an undisclosed patch of Oregon. There a nefarious real estate developer (Ken Jeong putting on that high-pitched screech of his) schemes to replace acres upon acres of untouched forest with a sprawling mall and McMansions. Off to the rescue run Mother Natures four-legged eco-crusaders a band of disparate species led by a resourceful diurnal raccoon who makes life heck for on-site Lyman flunky Dan Sanders (Fraser). The story progresses from bird attacks and stinky skunk shenanigans to a chase scene with bear and undies that concludes after a fashion with Fraser dangling from a tree in an upended portable toilet (and all that it implies). The forest denizens a mix of live-action and slipshod CGI display neither personality nor expressive flair communicating solely through Scooby-Doo-ish grunts and pictographic thought balloons. No animals were harmed in the making of this film; they were just made to look like badly rendered clip art. -- Advisory Rude humor mild language and brief smoking. Furry Vengeance J Comedy.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 30 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Apr. 29 2010 315PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Furry Vengeance Directed by Roger Kumble Written by Michael Carnes and Josh Gilbert Starring Brendan Fraser Brooke Shields Classification G For some reason movies involving CGI-enhanced animals slapstick humour and excretion jokes often fail to win over film reviewers so its a reasonable bet that the critical reception to Furry Vengeance a live-action comedy about insurgent forest animals will fall between Another Mediocre Family Comedy and Worst Brendan Fraser Comedy Ever. Still the appeal of this kind of film to audiences between 4 and 8 shouldnt be underestimated. As we have learned in innumerable movies - from Home Alone to Alvin and the Chipmunks the Squeakquel - children deeply enjoy watching grown-ups getting smacked tripped and splattered with various kinds of slop. When the humiliation is carried out by small furry animals the effect is only enhanced. More importantly even if youre not looking forward to seeing Brendan Fraser have a raccoon urinate on his face get trapped in a car filled with skunks or run about in a womens exercise suit with his belly hanging out Furry Vengeance is a movie with a worthy message. This is the first childrens film that involves Participant Media a production company founded by Canadian-born billionaire and former eBay president Jeff Skoll that contributes to films aimed at social change. Its roster includes An Inconvenient Truth Goodnight and Good Luck The Cove and The Soloist. In this case the message is to avoid building subdivisions in forest areas (any children who were thinking of doing so should reconsider). Fraser plays real-estate developer Dan Sanders a dad who thinks he knows best even as his wife (Brooke Shields) a high-school science teacher and his teen-aged son (Matt Prokop) roll their eyes make sardonic cracks and wait for him to come to his senses. The Sanders are the first residents of a new subdivision carved out of the Oregon forest. Dans company hides behind the green developer label while using sleazy lobbying tactics to despoil the forest. His boss is played by The Hangovers Ken Jeong in his latest mentally unstable Asian guy role and his bosss boss is an East Indian so the movie cant be accused of being too politically correct. As we learn in the pre-credits sequence Dan and his company are up against a wily and ruthless opponent a raccoon that inhabits the Oregon forest. The animal - a sort of woodsy Osama Bin Varmint - gets a lot of screen time walks upright squeaks and twitters plans improvised roadside attacks and organizes the forest birds and animals with a stump speech that uses picture bubbles formed from his head to inspire them. Fraser either through devotion to his craft or his executive producing credit proves willing to endure any kind of humiliation for a laugh. On the other hand Brooke Shields as his wife seems ill at ease (those famous caterpillar eyebrows suggest she may be allied with the enemy camp). As with Avatar and The Fantastic Mr. Fox theres a sense that the script (by Michael Carnes and Josh Gilbert) taps into motifs drawn from current American military conflicts. Theres the obvious contrast between the high-tech human invaders and the ruthlessly resourceful insurgency but more specifically wait for the scene when all the forest animals are imprisoned in a forest-glade version of Guantanamo Bay at which point even Dan realizes things may have gone too far. The paradox here is that the message of respect for animal life is outweighed by the lack of respect for human beings. Along with the save-the-animals message wouldnt it be feasible to include some socially constructive messages such as ""It makes Daddy cry when he gets hit in the crotch"" or ""Use your words not urine.""

He has done epic blockbusters (""The Mummy"" ""Journey to the Center of the Earth""). And yes he has done his share of juvenile comedies. (Surely somewhere at this moment a cable network is airing ""Bedazzled"" or ""Encino Man."") This StoryFurry Vengeance Um not the kick in the pants he needsFind Furry Vengeance showtimesWatch the trailer But with the eco-conscious family comedy ""Furry Vengeance"" the oafishly handsome star has finally found the movie that really allows him to showcase his acting range. Example In one ""Vengeance"" scene Fraser gets blasted in the crotch with a gushing garden hose. Then in another vastly different scene an angry raccoon bites him in the crotch. And in a third scene Fraser straddles the peaked roof of his exurban home while chasing a pesky crow then slips and falls totally nailing himself in the . . . Sigh. Yes ""Furry Vengeance"" is that kind of kid-friendly comedy one that finds its delights in the varying degrees of slapsticky torture inflicted on Dan Sanders (Fraser) a well-intentioned real estate developer who at the behest of his maniacal boss (Ken Jeong) is razing acres of forestland to make room for an allegedly environmentally friendly single-family subdivision called Rocky Springs. Its the same old story Pave paradise put up a bunch of green houses that allow Americans to park their hybrid SUVs in two-car garages. Of course the cuddly woodland creatures that live in that forest arent exactly in favor of the proposal. So they form their own preservation posse and pool their resources -- acorns boulders a surprising deftness for hot-wiring cars -- to unleash all manner of Animal Planet fury on Dan. He gets blasted with skunk juice. He gets carjacked by a wily raccoon. He even winds up with his pants down in a portable toilet that gets thrown into a tree by a really ticked-off bear. (Did I mention that Fraser starred in the excellent ""Gods and Monsters""? Thats a fact that may slip your mind while you watch him jostle around unpantsed inside a flying potty.) To be fair Fraser -- who energetically mugs his way through the nonstop nature show from hell -- isnt really the problem here. The problem or problems stem from the lazy unfunny script; the weak computer-generated animals (never have Gods creatures looked less lifelike while dancing to Chics ""Le Freak""); and the squandering of so much talent. Brooke Shields who plays Dans wife is stuck in a thankless role that allows her to adopt facial expressions ranging all the way from exasperation to polite befuddlement. And usually spot-on supporting players like Jeong and Angela Kinsey from TVs ""The Office"" dont get a solid shot at generating hilarity either. Even the obligatory blooper reel that runs during the closing credits is painful in its desperation to generate laughs. ""Furry Vengeance"" may teach young viewers that being kind to the Earth involves action not just self-serving lip service. Thats a good thing. But that theme has already been covered more effectively in other family-oriented fare such as ""Over the Hedge"" and ""Hoot."" Honestly the mental image most likely to stay put after ""Vengeance"" ends is one of Fraser taking yet another hit to his private parts. And honestly who needs that in their consciousness eco- or otherwise?  PG. At area theaters. Contains some rude humor mild language and brief smoking. 91 minutes. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2010 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Um not the kick in the pants he needs Find Furry Vengeance showtimes Watch the trailer",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/29/AR2010042901453.html,200,furryvengeance5,furryvengeance,washingtonpost

Imagine Alfred Hitchcocks ""The Birds"" as a childrens comedy and you have a rough idea of the excruciatingly unfunny ""Furry Vengeance"" which keeps slamming the audience over the head with a single joke. Thats birds and animals -- an army led by a beaver (who communicates in thought balloons) and includes crows squirrels and turkeys -- attacking a developer who plans to raze their nature preserve and turn it into a gated community. I wont deny some children may enjoy the sight of the developer (Brendan Fraser) being repeatedly doused in the critters bodily fluids and receiving blows to the crotch. But any adult unlikely enough to stick around for this will also be treated to the sight of the pudgy actor running around in a way-too-small pair of pink sweat pants before he is sent to a psychiatrist (Wallace Shawn). Those pants belong to Frasers unhappy wife -- a rare big-screen outing for Brooke Shields who gets less screen time than Frasers SUV. The vehicle oddly gets the most product placement (including an invasion by a squad of skunks) in this allegedly eco-friendly production. Although the ubiquitous Ken Jeong turns up in a vaguely racist role as Frasers ""comically"" accented boss Angela Kinsey (""The Office"") plays Jeongs assistant and Matt Prokop (""High School Musical 3"") is cast as Frasers son Fraser appears with just the animals in most of the movie. Sort of. They were in most cases photographed separately with computer-assisted expressions -- with CGI taking overly entirely (and unconvincingly) in the spectacularly witless climax. Fraser who has star-red in two part-animated films in the past is up for any sort of slapstick humiliation here but defeated by a script by the writers of ""Mr. Woodcock"" that almost managed to make me nostalgic for ""Over the Hedge"" and ""Dr. Doolittle."" Incoherently directed by Roger Kumble (""College Road Trip"") ""Furry Vengeance"" is co-sponsored by Participant Media which would be well advised to stick to socially conscious documentaries like the Oscar-winning ""The Cove."" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Live Its Saturday White Read Next Live Its Saturday White Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 17854 How Hillary blew her big moment 10583 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 7306 NYC tourist duped into buying 1M worth of fake jewelry Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Furry Vengeance May the furs be with you | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesFurry Vengeance May the furs be with youFamily comedy Furry Vengeance pits man against nature and guess who wins?Brendan Fraser gets smacked around by a raccoon in Furry Vengeance.  (AP)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. April 29 2010Furry Vengeance (out of 4)Starring Brendan Fraser Brooke Shields Ken Jeong Matt Prokop and Angela Kinsey. 91 minutes. At major theatres. GHeres how the pitch meeting may have gone for Furry Vengeance ""Its Poltergeist. But with raccoons.""Its cool to go green so Hollywood is happy to jump on the (low-emission electric-powered) bandwagon making evil developers the new villains and vigilante critters our superheroes. Article Continued BelowDan Sanders (Brendan Fraser The Mummy Inkheart) thinks hes building an environmentally conscious subdivision in the middle of the Oregon forest at the behest of his bipolar boss (The Hangovers Ken Jeong). Dans wife Tammy (Brooke Shields) and teen son Tyler (heartthrob Matt Prokop of High School Musical 3) are none too pleased about leaving bustling Chicago behind for what they see as rube-ringed wilderness. But Dan reminds them theyll be saving the planet one backsplit at a time -- and its only for a year.After all Dans a tree-hugger at heart. He starts each day with a deep inhale and a peaceful ""ahhh nature"" as he surveys the woodland view from his front lawn. Hes unaware the sprawling new phase of the development is to be built on habitat thats home to all manner of critters and soon he finds himself the target of uncaged rage when nature turns on him.Blessedly the animals do not talk in Furry Vengeance. But theres not much natural about them thanks to computer-aided facial expressions and a rich soundtrack of bleats and ""uh-ohs"" that sound like they were voiced by Frank Oz. The ringleader of the hole-in-the-log gang a tubby raccoon conveys his instructions to his fur and feathered army via thought balloons. My mother who has long suspected animals are looking at her ""funny"" while plotting their attacks would be very distressed to know they are also telepathic.Fraser gamely allows himself to be subjected to all manner of humiliations from having his pants wetted for him by the crafty raccoon (and being gleefully dubbed ""Mr. Pee-Pee Pants"" by his wife) to being trapped in his eco-friendly SUV with a troupe of skunks and being sent on a thrill ride in a port-o-potty by a furious bear. A skilled physical comic seemingly without shame Fraser grew a sizeable gut by gorging on a pre-shoot pizza and beer diet and lets it all hang out in various stages of undress. Kids will lose their minds at the sight of Fraser in a skin-tight pink tracksuit with the words ""Yum Yum"" on his sizeable backside. Parents will sigh and eat popcorn.Shields is an ideal foil for Frasers antics taking her share of tumbles and stumbles along the way. They actually seem like a pair of marrieds and have considerable onscreen chemistry. Cant say the same for Jeong and his assistant (The Offices Angela Kinsey) who take up the role of dueling hams including a tiresome ""no not that kind of Indian"" joke that is both racist and ridiculous. A dream sequence involving robotic-looking CGI creatures getting down to a funky porcupine DJ spinning ""Le Freak"" in the kitchen looks more like a taxidermists nightmare. If you stay in your seat for the credits rather than making the patented T.O. bolt for the exit prepare yourself for a lengthy outtakes-style video as Shields and Fraser mug dressed as a variety of pop culture icons to ""Insane in the Brain"" -- not the Cyprus Hill version either.Directed by Roger Kumble who should still be forced to sit in the corner for College Road Trip Furry Vengeance is the sort of hyper free-for-all that will keep kids sufficiently entertained for 90 minutes even if they leave the theatre thinking that otters can drive cars and ermines can form the intent to exact revenge.

Unfortunately the creature caper is a painfully unfunny family flick. (Summit) Joe Neumaier Thursday April 29 2010 440 PM Title Furry Vengeance If only ""Furry Vengeance"" were a foreign film that had been dubbed incorrectly or an experimental movie whose backers got a load of cash and decided to add rampaging bears and angry squirrels. Then the insanity onscreen might make a little more sense. But the truth is this is just one nutso painfully unfunny family flick.Even calling it a family flick is to run the risk of guiding families toward it by mistake. Sure kids under 4 may be briefly amused by forest creatures that dance and pop their eyes yet even they will likely view the antics as unacceptable even by the standards of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks The Squeakquel"" or the animated ""Over the Hedge"" which this story recalls.Brendan Fraser plays Dan an executive for a housing development firm thats tearing up Oregon timberland for a future subdivision. Dans updates to his nasty boss (Ken Jeong) are overheard by a raccoon who somehow understands English so the raccoon gets his winged clawed and pawed pals to make Dans life very hairy Skunks spray him. Birds drop dung on him. An otter rolls a boulder at him. (At least the animals dont talk - they communicate in chirps and pantomimes and sometimes we see what theyre thinking via thought bubbles.)Well-meaning Dan soon learns his companys green image is just a slogan and that the animals are endangered. Meanwhile his wife (an unrecognizable Brooke Shields) and son (Matt Prokop) are never around when the varmints attack and so think Dan is losing his mind.You may lose yours as the long 90 minutes pass. Fraser does what he can to keep things fun including hamming it up in various moments of humiliation. Since hes become a family-films guy Fraser works best when he uses his once-buff good-naturedness for self-deprecating heroism as in ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" and ""Inkheart."" In that realm his dopey smile reassures kids that a good time is possible. Here he looks apologetic.To its credit there are things so strange in ""Furry Vengeance"" that they have a kooky appeal and there is minimal CGI; the critters were trained for their shenanigans. The silliest bits show the tricky traps they set including a model of the humans forest festival complete with roller coasters made of sticks. The conclusion at that festival though goes for pandemonium over invention. Guess the filmmakers were a few otters short of a romp.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Furry Vengeance Coarse family film is a slapstick stinker - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Furry Vengeance Coarse family film is a slapstick stinker Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge Summit Entertainment via AP This radical raccoon and other creatures fight back when a ""green""-company executive (Brendan Fraser) bulldozes their land. ABOUT THE MOVIEFurry Vengeance out of four Stars Brendan Fraser Brooke Shields Ken Jeong Matt ProkopDirector Roger KumbleDistributor Summit EntertainmentRating PG for some rude humor mild language and brief smokingRunning time 1 hour 31 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY ""I just dont think this can get any worse"" Brooke Shields says in Furry Vengeance playing a woman married to a man beset by woodland creatures. She couldnt be more right. Furry Vengeance is a slapstick stinker easily the worst movie of the year. And its from the same company responsible for last years The Hurt Locker which won the best-picture Oscar. Go figure. This coarse family film is an insult to sentient families. Purporting to encourage conservation and the love of animals its a slight to true environmentalists and heck even an affront to animals. TRAILER See a preview of Furry Vengeance Whats lacking amid the over-acting shoddy special effects and pratfalls is imagination. Everything feels slapdash and repetitive. Do we need to see three incidents of skunkings a parade of urinations and body excretions as well as several attacks to the groin? Theres simply nothing to recommend this mirthless mess. It might have been sick fun to listen in on the pitch meeting when the filmmakers touted the moronic high concept ""A company is raping the land plowing down a scenic wilderness. All the animals become radical protesters and fight back. Think Home Alone in the forest. We can feature hilarious armies of skunks sneaking into an SUV and birds that dive-bomb and defecate everywhere. A cute raccoon is in charge of all the torment."" When informed this movie was already made and it was called Over the Hedge no doubt some savvy producer pointed out this would be wildly different live action not animated. If anyone piped up to enumerate the similarities toDoctor Dolittle he was probably shushed. Brendan Fraser stars as Dan an exec at an allegedly green company thats paving paradise and putting up a subdivision. He uprooted his family -- wife Tammy (Shields) and teenage son Tyler (Matt Prokop) -- from Chicago to the Oregon woods to oversee the project. Since he is destroying their habitat the critters have a hit out on him. His boss Neal Lyman -- get it? Lie Man -- constantly touts the companys eco-friendliness but even a toddler can see hes a ridiculous hypocrite. Somehow though Dan cant. Ken Jeong is cringe-worthy as Lyman lapsing into high-pitched gibberish when English language humor fails. There are other racist undertones including slurs confusing Native Americans and Indians. Shields is humorless wearing one expression throughout the movie -- annoyance -- no doubt informed by her decision to be a part of this inane film. Though hes given only terrible dialogue to spout the usually likable Fraser seems to be channeling Jackie Gleason. His bug-eyed expressions and yowls of exasperation dont give us a jot of insight into his obtuse character. Its nearly impossible to believe this foolish guy skittering around in his tighty whities is the same Fraser who a dozen years ago gave such a moving performance in Gods and Monsters. Seeing him as this doughy unfunny doofus makes you want to run screaming and pop in a George of the Jungle DVD for old times sake.

Heres a pro-nature anti-development family comedy that appears to be made by and for people who never leave the mall.For a heartwarming eco-fable about woodland critters rebelling against mankind ""Vengeance has the odor of court-ordered community service. The jokes never rise above the groin. The trees look plastic the characters more so. The animals -- oh dear god the animals. Modified into ""adorable anthropomorphic behavior by bargain-basement computer animation the various raccoons skunks possums and squirrels come across as hideous midget cyborgs furry corpses brought back to twitching life through the miracle of modern special effects.But hey take the kids.Actually the most abused mammal in ""Furry Vengeance may be star Brendan Fraser who plays Dan Sanders a good-guy builder trying to carve a ""green housing development out of a pristine forest preserve. Thats right hes the hero. At the behest of his sleazy boss (comic actor Ken Jeong going over the top into full-on racial self-parody; Gedde Watanabe you can finally let your guard down) Dan has moved into one of his show houses with skeptical wife Tammy (yes that Brooke Shields) and rebellious teen son Tyler (Matt Prokop).He doesnt know that the animals in this neck of the woods have been fighting off humans for centuries taking the time-honored ""Home Alone approach of throwing heavy things at our testicles. The ringleader is a raccoon; his secret weapon is a bear. ""Furry Vengeance was shot locally (in Topsfield) and is set in the Pacific Northwest but its sense of wilderness is as generic as freshly laid blacktop. One of Dans tormentors is a lovely pied crow which last time I checked (just now on Google) is native to Africa. But who expects a movie about the outdoors to get the species right? What are you a nature geek?Directed by Roger Kumble who started with teen movies (""Cruel Intentions) and is working his way down the evolutionary ladder ""Furry Vengeance will tickle very young children and others who persist in thinking of animals as little people in fur suits. It will appall everyone else not because of the gaping disconnect between its message and its methods but because the movies simply thunderingly unfunny. The hero gets gassed by skunks stung by bees assaulted by a South African condor () and even when the plot works up to a pitch of Tom-and-Jerry lunacy -- when Dan appears before his construction crew wearing a bra the animals have somehow engineered him into -- the frenzied editing and prefab music suck the laughs away.Theres a much better comedy in this idea and probably a decent horror movie too (""Furry Vengeance Survival of the Fittest) but neither of them would star Fraser who has ballooned alarmingly in recent years and who spends much of the film with his shirt off and his gut protruding. The mans starting to resemble a human pork rind; any bigger and Macys will be calling. Yes yes its unfair to mock an actors body but here Frasers flab seems symbolic of the movie as a whole.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A lack of vanity is generally a prerequisite for comedic actors especially those who do any kind of physical business but Brendan Frasers enthusiasm for embarrassing himself goes further than most. Hes the anti-Hugh Grant a shameless ham with no pretense to sophistication which is what makes him endearing in spite of his propensity for appearing in bad movies. Other actors might feel some compunction about playing a hapless Wile E. Coyote to a pack of crafty raccoons skunks and other forest animals but not Fraser who eagerly falls into every trap and absorbs every blow to the head or groin with the same giddy anything-goes spirit. While Frasers presence doesnt necessarily elevate Furry Vengeance into something better than the dumb lowbrow timewaster it aspires to be Fraser does make it a little easier to digest. He stars as a real-estate man who moves his reluctant wife (Brooke Shields) and teenage son (Matt Prokop) from New York to the Oregon wilderness to spearhead a development project. Driven by his career ambition and a megalomaniacal boss (a funny Ken Jeong) Fraser sets out to build a sprawling subdivision in an ""eco-friendly"" way but the local animal population rightly sees through his plans. Led by a raccoon mastermind the forest creatures come together for an all-out assault on Fraser until he and his bosses finally relent. Produced by Participant Media which backs projects of social relevance Furry Vengeance grafts on a surprisingly tough message about so-called ""eco-friendly"" companies and the green PR schemes they devise to paper over their destruction of the environment. But such high-mindedness feels conspicuously out of place in a movie where the smartest character has four legs. An absurdly overqualified cast of bit players--Rob Riggle Samantha Bee Wallace Shawn The Offices Angela Kinsey--contribute where they can but Furry Vengeance is fundamentally about Brendan Fraser getting beat up by creepily anthropomorphized animals.

Asked to explain the difference between ""Monkey Bone"" ""Bedazzled"" ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" and his latest ""Furry Vengeance"" I might plead for my mummy. Fraser has built a small dorky industry by being an exceptionally smiley fellow. He is cheery positive and always gives himself fully to the movie at hand -- which is more than can be said for many. In ""Furry Vengeance"" he plays a father Dan Sanders who has moved his family from Chicago to the Oregon woods where he hopes to please his demanding boss (Ken Jeong) by overseeing a new suburban housing development. His wife (Brooke Shields) and his mopey teenage son (Matt Prokop) miss the city and regard Dans obsessive loyalty to his boss increasingly skeptically. As Dan supervises the ""Rocky Springs"" development an uprising takes form. Their habitat threatened the wilderness animals seek to frighten off the intruders. Led by a raccoon the tiny insurgents outwit and bedevil Dan until his sanity begins to slip. Its a bit like if Alfred Hitchcock had made ""The Birds"" as a 5-year-old. The cleverest thing about ""Furry Vengeance"" is that the company Dan works for touts itself as a ""green company."" In truth its nothing of the sort. They happily explode beaver dams and trample through pristine forest to lay down pavement and a shopping mall. Eventually the forest animals are locked up in a Guantanamo Bay-like prison. Thankfully the movie doesnt extend this metaphor. Advertise Advertise Advertise Dans own money-hungry boss curses the pseudo environmentalists who live green ""only when convenient."" Dan who drives an SUV hybrid very much falls into that category. He barely survives before learning that its not always easy to be eco-friendly. Video Brooke Shields takes on nature in Vengeance The lesson is no coincidence ""Furry Vengeance"" is produced by Participant Media whose earlier films include the Oscar-winning documentary ""The Cove"" and ""Food Inc."" neither of which is exactly shy about its respective message. The animals here thankfully arent talking cartoons though theyre close. The film uses a mixture of CGI and real-life trained animals -- which is surely a tad hypocritical too for a film about letting nature be. (After all ""The Cove"" centers on Ric OBarry who became an activist after rebelling against the treatment of a dolphin for a TV show ""Flipper."") No animals may have been hurt in this production but Brendan Fraser was. That he bothers with films like this is dispiriting because of his talent as evidenced by movies like ""The Quiet American"" and ""Crash."" Those films made use of his smiley demeanor for a superficial cover not just vacant broad comedy. Copyright 2010 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

And concise too since this family-oriented comedy celebrates small animals in the wild (yay) who join tiny paws to thwart the schemes of a greedy real estate developer (boo) whos attempting to tear up a nice green forest and turn it into a tacky beige housing development (hiss). In the movies strenuously slapsticky lesson plan though the methods of justice meted out by squeaking nibbling and chirping creatures are a little less adorable Most of the guerrilla warfare is aimed at the crotch and nearby orifices of Dan Sanders (Brendan Fraser) a doughy goofy run-of-the-mill ecological hypocrite assigned to oversee construction on behalf of his screechy capitalist boss (Ken Jeong). Another specimen in Frasers notable collection of male blockheads (and I say that as a fan of the subspecies as Fraser plays em) Dan exasperates his wife (Brooke Shields) embarrasses his teenage son (Matt Prokop) and is certainly in need of enlightenment. But Im not convinced that repeated assaults to the groin bee stings to the eyes raccoon pee in the mouth or skunk stink sprayed head to toe is the way to teach ecological balance. Or even to amuse pint-size moviegoers whose first glimpse of the merry mayhem is the sight of a guy in a car being forced off a cliff. (The guy an obnoxious tycoon type is played by former Daily Show comedian Rob Riggle but still What works in a Looney Tunes animation looks creepy in live action.) Still its refreshing that the animals dont talk. Thats a nice rare show of restraint on the part of director Roger Kumble (Cruel Intentions) and screenwriters Michael Carnes and Josh Gilbert (Mr. Woodcock). Its nice too that hip comic actors dropped by for small roles among them Angela Kinsey from The Office and The Daily Shows Samantha Bee. I wonder did these ladies take the gigs so their own kids could see Mommy in a movie in which a man learns to be green while his groin turns black and blue?

Furry Vengeance Bomb Director Roger Kumble. Cast Brendan Fraser Brooke Shields Matt Prokop. Rating Rated PG for some rude humor mild language and brief smoking. RELATED Spotlight Brendan Fraser Films with animal stars Models in movies Revenge movies Adorable woodland creatures spend the bulk of the movie savagely attacking and humiliating Brendan Fraser which is fine; its his career. Evidently unsatisfied with what they have wrought the filmmakers inflict similar savagery on the audience by subjecting it to a stupid mean-spirited little movie that ranks down there with the worst in recent memory. Distant memory too. Fraser plays Dan Sanders a seemingly decent developer (not always an oxymoron) who has uprooted his family from Chicago and moved them to the Oregon wilderness where his company is building a housing development. His wife Tammy (Brooke Shields) and son Tyler (Matt Prokop) are less than happy about the arrangement but its only for a year so they muddle through. Then Dans boss Neal (Ken Jeong) decides he wants to create even more developments which will entail ripping out a forest (even though his company supposedly is green) and keeping Dan and his family in Oregon for four more years albeit at twice the salary. Will Dan succumb to temptation even if it means betraying himself and his family? Dont do it Dan Dont do it He does it. And thats when the animals get their revenge. A raccoon is the brains of the operation (who knew?) planning various forms of mayhem against Dan in an attempt to get him to pull up stakes and head back to the Midwest. Skunks hiding in his SUV (a hybrid of course)? If its funny once why not do it twice in a row? Problem is it isnt funny the first time. We know the animals are good at this sort of thing because the movie starts with their dispatching of the man Neal originally wanted for the job (Rob Riggle in a cameo) knocking him and his sports car off a cliff with a boulder. Great Hilarious Enjoy it kids (As if to soften things Riggles character is heard to mutter ""I quit"" after the fall presumably from the bottom of the cliff. Or maybe from hell I dont know.) The problem with ""Furry Vengeance"" and with director Roger Kumbles narrative is not that its stupid that Dan can be throttled one minute for instance and fine the next. Thats not ideal mind you but it can be overcome with humor. Ah but there is no humor here. Instead there is a mean-spirited vibe that is at first off-putting and eventually exhausting. If your idea of fun is to continually watch a man fall off a roof get stung by bees sprayed repeatedly by skunks chased by a bear and - heres a good one - dumped upside down in a portable toilet well youre in luck. There are slight nods to perhaps a curse son Tyler falls for a girl a school festival is . . . wait look The raccoon just squirted Dan in the crotch with a sprinkler Maybe your kids will insist that you see ""Furry Vengeance."" Then again wouldnt this be the perfect time to let them test their independence and sit through it alone? Otherwise good luck. You have my condolences.

The boys a savvy consumer of kids popular culture--my greatest parenting triumph thus far. He knew from the myriad Disney Channel commercials (the movie stars Matt Prokop of High School Musical 3) that Furry V featured computer-generated animals inflicting all manner of cruel wackiness upon humans and so he asked ""Is it in 3D? Because every other kids movie is."" I told him no (he was crushed-- crushed) and that if hed seen the commercials he should know wed be lucky it if was in focus. Ninety minutes later we agreed that Furry Vengeance was in B-A-D. Well I decided this--he argued that it was actually quite hilarious.The simple thesis of the movie is very much made for the 6 to oh lets say 61/2 year old set People do bad things to the planet. Like build sprawling housing developments where they shouldnt in this case an unspoiled forest populated by pissed-off woodland creatures whove wrought generations worth of hilarious pain upon would-be settlers. (As opposed to building sprawling subdivisions on top of sacred Indian burial grounds or portals to Hell--different movies entirely.)Furry Vengeance isnt really a movie at all; its a message provided by the good people at Participant Media whove brought you among other entertainments Food Inc. (which will make you never want to eat again) The Cove (which is kind of like an espionage caper only it ends with the real-life slaughter of hundreds of dolphins) and the forthcoming Climate of Change (a Tilda Swinton-narrated doc about ordinary folks efforts worldwide to combat global warming). The films Web site offers kids an activity guide and redirects them to the Endangered Species Coalition The Wilderness Society and Defenders of Wildlife. They all but print the lesson plan on biodegradable popcorn boxes.In other words Participant knows comedyBrendan Fraser plays Dan a pudgy schnook who uprooted his family (including Brooke Shields who has never looked comfortable playing funny) to the wild in order to tear it down at the behest of his boss. The boss incidentally is played by the increasingly ubiquitous Ken Jeong--who when hes not saying things like ""Its not about green--its about the shades of gray"" will occasionally speak in high-pitched Japanese thus rendering Furry Vengeance both eco-friendly and vaguely racist. (Also starring Rob Riggle and Samantha Bee of The Daily Show.)When the animals--chiefly a raccoon and a squirrel--catch wind of the developers plan to pave baby pave they revolt. And yes this sounds exactly like a cross between the Eddie Murphy Doctor Dolittle movies (which were oddly more clever--though I cant and refuse to recall exactly how) and the animated Over the Hedge in which the raccoon was voiced by Bruce Willis and Steve Carell played the squirrel who became addicted to humans junk food and equally crap culture. The animals here dont talk; thats the movies one saving grace. Their facial reactions and gestures are still computer-augmented though and during the climactic smackdown most of the creatures are entirely CG. Its not a cartoon but it almost is.Fraser is put through the wringer--Ive never felt sorrier for an actor. Clearly he lost a bet to Participant founder Jeff Skoll. Then again my kid was tickled by the sight of a dude with a huge belly being slathered in bird shit skunk spray gallons of tomato juice and Port-o-Let piss. Maybe not such a parenting triumph after all.
