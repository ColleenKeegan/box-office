India is the new Italy for retirees seeking a hot climate to renew their lust for life based on the evidence of comedy-drama ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" Frequently droll and likable albeit thoroughly predictable helmer John Maddens latest boasts a crack cast of seasoned thesps who sock over every wry line and wring maximum emotional resonance from a sometimes clunky script about a gaggle of Brit seniors who move to Jaipur. The potentially huge but usually underserved demographic of 50-plus auds could take a real shine to ""Marigold"" if cultivated correctly. Quickfire opening montage featuring tiny scenes spliced together so quickly it plays like a 50 Cent video relates the circumstances of the pics seven elderly protags. Recently widowed Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) has just found out her late husband frittered away most of their money and has to sell her plush London home to pay off debts. Married couple Douglas and Jean Ainslie (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) have likewise been unlucky and lost all their savings investing in their daughters struggling startup. Senior singletons Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) and Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) long to find new love partners or in Normans case to just get to have sex again. Retired high-court judge Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) merely longs for a change of scene. Finally diehard xenophobe Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith) discovers that getting a hip replacement and recovering from it in India would be a better option than whats on offer from Blightys national health service. All of the above thus choose to ""outsource"" themselves to the newly opened Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur a once-stately now-ramshackle palace that irrepressibly optimistic owner Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) has presciently marketed to the Geritol set as a retirement residence. However hes rather played down in his brochure the lack of doors on some of the rooms and presence of roosting pigeons in others. The seven transplants take up various attitudinal positions on India. Having been raised there as a child and back now to search for a long-lost love Graham embraces Indias challenges its kind people and beauty. At the other end of the spectrum Jean is horrified by the inefficiency and squalor and refuses to venture further than the hotel compound while Muriel incapacitated by her surgery similarly stays put and insists she wont eat anything she doesnt know how to pronounce. Perhaps trying to reflect the sensory overload of the country in which its set the pic barely relaxes the pace after its whirlwind opening. Script by Ol Parker adapted from a novel by Deborah Moggach quickly cycles through the various characters storylines as the relationships between them fracture and reconfigure with dizzying speed. At times it feels as if Parker and Madden (""The Debt"") have crammed in too much the equivalent of six months worth of soap-opera action into the two-hour running time. The speed with which Muriel for instance converts from total racist to wise kindly old dear by the end stretches credibility too far even allowing for the slack auds will cut the ever lovable Smith in the role. Elsewhere some might feel uncomfortable about the fact that the only gay character gets handily killed off before he does anything that might frighten the horses or the films more conservative target aud. However the powerhouse cast is so capable the actors just about manage to play the pic as if it were a ""Midsummer Nights Dream""-style frothy farce with marigold garlands and picturesque poverty. Even when things grow a bit darker there are still zingers to be enjoyed such as when Imries vampish Madge dreading old age tartly declaims ""I dont want to be the first person they let off the train in a hostage crisis."" Underneath all larkiness ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" makes interesting points about the challenges facing elderly people trying to cope in an adverse economic climate and the globalization of service industries. Although the point is too tidily made theres an interesting parallel between the way companies outsource customer care to call centers in India and the way seniors are forced to retire to developing nations where their money will go further. Ten or 20 years ago the pics characters might have found themselves in Spains Costa del Sol or one of Italys remoter regions but the weakness of the pound versus the Euro makes the core premise a not unlikely one. Use of color and sound reps the standout element of the pro tech package and the assistant director deserves a particular shoutout for wrangling the crowd scenes so well. Location work ably captures the dusty dirty vigor and visual glory of Jaipur.

"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (PG-13) Culture clash in India with comic charming consequences. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald5/10/2012 Editor rating 3 The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel provides a mini-fix for Downton Abbey addicts twitching over the fact that their beloved series wont be back on PBS until next year (PBS is probably lamenting this too Downton being its highest-rated show since well forever.) The film about a group of British citizens who retire to India stars two of Downtons cast members and one of them is unlikely but undeniable pop culture touchstone Maggie Smith who not only threw down with Voldemort in the final Harry Potter saga but also launched websites memes and mashups as the eminently quotable Dowager Countess of Downton. Who needs retirement when you get roles like that? Smiths Marigold Hotel co-stars are equally impressive. Judi Dench Tom Wilkinson Bill Nighy fellow Downtonian Penelope Wilton Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup play the other retirees seeking an affordable yet genteel place to enjoy their golden years; the appealing Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) is the eager but somewhat clueless young entrepreneur Sonny who has inherited his dead fathers hotel and wants to ""outsource"" aging to India. His brochures lure the Brits with promises his crumbling hotel cant keep and cultural mishaps and misunderstandings swiftly pile up among his guests except for Graham (Wilkinson) a retired judge who spent part of his youth in India and has personal reasons for wanting to return. Everybody else however struggles in this brave new world. A widow (Dench) must find a job to make ends meet. A couple (Nighy and Wilton) discovers their responses to the new environment are entirely at odds (hes intrigued by the differences; she is horrified). An embittered racist (Smith) must overcome her fear of foreign hospitals and doctors before she has surgery and two lonely souls (Imrie and Pickup) wonder if they can find love at this stage of their lives though not necessarily with each other. Even young Sonny has problems His mother wants to sell the hotel and because she doesnt much like his girlfriend (Tena Desae) arrange his marriage to a more suitable prospect. There are predictable jokes about the uneasy alliance between Indian food and British digestive systems (although theyre more tasteful than youd think) and some of the films storylines are resolved a bit too conveniently. One in particular feels uncomfortably pat. But director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) has captured something lovely here too not only in his terrific cast but in the sights and sounds and colors of India (the movie was filmed in Udaipur in Rajasthan). The script adapted by Ol Parker from Deborah Moggachs novel is funny and often touching even when issues work out a bit neatly. The movies charms lie in its frank and amusing assessment of age -- the limits often reside solely in your head -- and in its heartening message that life isnt over just because youve hit 65. As for the Marigold Hotel well its not the Delano. But overall its a fine spot to spend a couple of hours.

BOTTOM LINE A contrived comedy-drama but worth seeing for the once-in-a-lifetime cast of Englands finest. CAST Judi Dench Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson Penelope Wilton. LENGTH 202 Even the finest actors in the world generally cant save a silly script -- unless that is theyre actually literally the finest actors in the world. ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" certainly has quite a few. Some are British veterans who wont be familiar to Americans while the others are famous names attached to titles like ""Dame"" and ""OBE."" The movie itself is a mawkish comedy-drama-romance but the astounding cast makes it feel like a night on the West End. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? For starters theres Judi Dench playing not a queen but a cash-strapped widow Evelyn one of several seniors whose golden years seem somehow tarnished. Tom Wilkinson is Graham a high-court judge with a secret; Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton are Douglas and Jean whose savings have disappeared in a floundering Internet start-up; Celia Imrie plays Madge a gold digger still honing her pick; Ronald Pickup is Norman a skirt-chaser refusing to slow down. Theyll converge as ensemble casts are wont to do in one place the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel advertised as a home ""for the elderly and beautiful"" in Darpur India. What follows is a collection of back stories and new developments some more convincing than others. Nighy Wilton and Dench form a triangle of sorts that could almost carry a one-act play while Maggie Smith is so good as Muriel a cantankerous racist that she pulls off what should be a highly unconvincing epiphany. Even Dev Patel (""Slumdog Millionaire"") as the hotels ever-optimistic manager prevents his chattering role from tipping into caricature. Ably directed by John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") and based on a novel by Deborah Moggach ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" has all the weaknesses of its genre particularly the tied-in-a-bow ending. But with a cast like this its hard to argue.PLOT Seven British seniors uproot themselves to live in an Indian retirement home.

Ishika Mohan Tom Wilkinson in ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" Photo by Ishika Mohan For American retirees a cheap alternative to the Sun Belt is Central America. For British retirees in ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" a cheap alternative to the poorhouse is northern India where affordable rent and medical care beckon pensioners who remember the Raj.Adapting a novel by Deborah Moggach director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") has assembled a cast of pros who breathe life into sketchy characters.Providing an overview is Evelyn (Judi Dench) a widow who sells her property believes the brochure that promises luxury living in Jaipur and writes a blog about it. Joining her on the journey are the bankrupted Ainslies (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) who are open-minded and nervous respectively; love-starved Norman (Ronald Pickup) who shaves a couple of decades from his age as he trolls the singles bars on two continents; much-married Madge (Celia Imrie) who hopes to meet a maharajah; retired judge Graham (Tom Wilkinson) who hopes to find the Indian boy he loved in his youth; and racist Muriel (Maggie Smith) who hopes to find British biscuits as she recovers from hip-replacement surgery. When their new retirement home turns out to be a decrepit hotel in the midst of a teeming city half of them are drawn to the color and fragrance while the other half are in shock. Urging them to visualize his planned improvements is young innkeeper Sonny (Dev Patel ""Slumdog Millionaire""). He needs a successful business to placate his mother and to marry Sanaina who works in a call center. For the target audience theres assuredly something hypnotic about the predictable rhythms of this ensemble piece. ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is an Indian dish for day-trippers.

In others its just enough to see several well-endeared actors join together regardless of the universe they share. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for example sets its ensemble in only the most colorful and charmingly dilapidated corners of Jaipur India a colonial fantasy inhabited by the elderly of England as they seek a reasonable retirement for themselves. When the cast in question includes Bill Nighy Maggie Smith Tom Wilkinson and Judi Dench one doesnt fear for flat performances and if anything the old pros are exactly what elevates Hotels otherwise pat screenplay into that sweet spot where predictability fails to negate pleasure. Were introduced in fairly short order to our seven leads the newly widowed Evelyn (Dench) the recently retired Graham (Wilkinson) the restlessly married Douglas (Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton) the sugar daddy-seeking Madge (Celia Imrie) the younger girl-craving Norman (Ronald Pickup) and the staunchly xenophobic Muriel (Maggie Smith). They all have their reasons for taking the trip -- whether for new starts old flames or more affordable hip surgery -- and they all just happen to agree that the hotel of the title is the place for them. Of course the establishment isnt quite as shipshape as exceedingly earnest proprietor Sonny (Dev Patel) would have had them believe but most of the crew decides to make the most of it... MUCH AS ONE DOES WITH LIFE. Ol Parkers adaptation of Deborah Moggachs novel ""These Foolish Things"" is a tidy thing full of simplistic character arcs and life lessons and overstuffed at exactly one subplot too many. A romance between Sonny and a colleague of Evelyns at the call center where she finds herself employed for the first time in her life tsk-tsked by his mother and her brother feels wedged in to keep the proceedings from being too white and wrinkled for their own good. Yet once the easy culture shock gags subside the cast members rise to the occasion in a way Patel is never fully allowed and perhaps isnt quite capable of at this point in his career. For instance Smiths curmudgeonly ways are so viably ingrained in her body language let alone the clipped tone of her frequent insults that her inevitably heart-thawing transformation from racist prig to accepting resident becomes more bearable than it ought to be. More transparently charming are Imrie and Pickup playing frisky beyond their years and making up for the scripts occasional Viagra crack while Dench and Wilkinson each get to convey more melancholy tones of transition in the respective twilights of their lives. A fitting disparity of nuance falls between Wiltons often harried turn and Nighys easygoing charm underlined by a rightfully ragged outburst that brings out the actors too-seldom-seen emotional side. Its these grace notes of the characters (and perhaps the actors) substantial life experience -- their desires their frustrations and so on -- that keep the featherweight film from drifting into navel-gazing Eat Pray Love territory and with John Madden (Shakespeare in Love last years The Debt) at the helm theres a tonal harmony amid all the travelogue moments that keeps the film a notch or two above the similarly wholesome likes of say the recent Salmon Fishing in the Yemen. As Sonny reassures his disappointed customers early on ""Everything will be alright in the end and if it is not alright then it is not the end."" The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is alright in the end and for most of the two hours that precede it.

(Video Walt Disney Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 4 2012 1004 a.m. ET What if Marvel gave a party and everybody came? Thats the organizing principle of ""The Avengers"" the much-anticipated hugely hyped immensely expensive and fitfully enjoyable (with an asterisk) convocation of comic book superheroes in which Iron Man Captain America the Incredible Hulk Thor Black Widow and Hawkeye team up to save the world. Ill explain the asterisk later. First let me note the magnitude of the event for the movies fan base versus the oddity of the mash-up--a slow start a single star performance surrounded by indifferent acting and an onslaught of computer effects that range from seen-it-all-in-""Transformers"" to a whole sky full of spectacular stuff in the midtown Manhattan climax. (Joss Whedon directed from a script he wrote with Zak Penn.) The star is Robert Downey Jr. His Iron Man is certainly a team player but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers a character of established sophistication--the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark a sharp-tongued man of the world--and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony. (He was much better in the first ""Iron Man"" but hes quite good here.) ""The Avengers"" which takes place in murky darkness for the first half-hour or so begins to lighten up figuratively if not literally only when Iron Man appears and we see on the lips of the man inside the red robotic rig a faint smile that says ""this is going to be fun."" The fun in seeing his teammates lies mostly in watching them in action although they quarrel comically among themselves at the outset like superdivas ""Were not a team"" Mark Ruffalos Bruce Banner says ""were a time bomb."" Share Your Photos Going to see ""The Avengers""? We want to feature your photos of fans in costume. Email us at yourphotoswsj.com or share on Twitter and Instagram with the hashtag avengersWSJ. Mr. Ruffalo as the anger-plagued scientist previously played by Edward Norton makes a point of keeping Banners emotions at a simmer lest Banner turn into the raging Hulk but the point is overdone in the name of underdoing and the result is blandness. Its easy to like Chris Evans as Captain America; likability is the retro-heros shield against contempo-hip. Chris Hemsworths Thor is more than likable; the demigod is touching in his attachment to his trusty hammer. Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow fill out the sextet without adding much pizazz; Black Widow spends lots of time looking puzzled or confused. Tom Hiddleston is the villainous Loki determined to steal a potential source of unlimited energy. The cast includes Samuel L. Jackson (in lower-energy mode) as Nick Fury Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson and Gwyneth Paltrow whose Pepper Potts makes a brief appearance and then toward the end an even briefer reappearance that plays like an afterthought. What passes for a plot is simple enough even if frequent references to the characters back stories may leave you feeling that you missed a prescreening plot briefing. At first the Avengers are hard put to avenge anything because theyre outnumbered and outgunned by Lokis extraterrestrial army. ""Stark we need a plan"" Captain America says. ""I have a plan"" Stark replies brightly. ""Attack."" Attack they do energetically and episodically in their individual styles. Still it says something about the action--and the nature of action movies--that the wittiest moment comes when Stark says ""Hulk smash"" and the greatest satisfaction involves watching the green guy smash everything in sight as well as fling Loki around like a limp rag doll. More Avengers The Secret Agent Behind ""The Avengers"" Can You Really Get As Big As The Hulk? Mark Ruffalo on what ""The Avengers"" Says About America ""The Avengers"" Leads IMAX Parade ""Avengers"" 101 Now about that asterisk. I saw ""The Avengers"" in 3-D at a screening in Hollywood at the ArcLight a multiplex known for excellent projection. As soon as the opening credits hit the screen it was obvious that something was wrong; the images were dim and badly out of register. I should have known that the problem was a dead battery in my glasses since the same thing had happened--in a different theater--during last years disastrous screening of ""Clash of the Titans."" Instead I sat there stewing with frustration and assuming the projection was to blame since a couple of friends whod come with me were having the same problem. One of them went out to complain but nothing happened. A few minutes later he went out again and returned with replacement glasses for himself his wife and me. Someone had told him the glasses were the culprit but those batteries were dead too. The third try did the trick; he passed out three pairs of glasses that worked. By then though Id been distracted for most of the first act and felt more empathy than I would have preferred for Bruce Banners problems with anger management. Thats the main reason Im recounting this here. The technical screw-up was so upsetting that it may have skewed my judgment about the movie as a whole. I think I settled down but I cant be sure and I cant omit mention of the problem from my review. The other reason has to do with the status of theatrical exhibitors as the weakest link in the 3-D process. (Some theaters have already been caught reducing light levels on the screen to extend the life of expensive projector lamps.) What happened to me and others at the ArcLight the other night was the height of absurdity. Here we were watching a production that cost somewhere in the neighborhood of a quarter-billion dollars. Yet our enjoyment was compromised by button batteries that cant cost more than a buck a pop. And we were an invited audience privileged to see an advance screening not moviegoers paying hefty premiums for their 3-D experience. I shudder to think what they see. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Lets stipulate that older moviegoers are underserved to the point of starvation by a youth-obsessed entertainment industry. Yet theyre ill-served by this story of British retirees traveling to India to spend their sunset years in a retirement hotel thats supposedly as beautiful as it is inexpensive. The hotel turns out to be a ramshackle disappointment where almost nothing works as advertised. The same goes for the movie even though the cast includes some of the best English actors of our time--Judi Dench Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson and Maggie Smith. Watch a clip from ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" starring Judi Dench and Bill Nighy. (Video Fox Searchlight) Theyre stuck with a script by Ol Parker thats stuffed with contrivance and cliche and doggedly repetitive as it tracks its characters efforts to find new love and adapt to new surroundings. When a genuinely dramatic encounter takes place--it involves Graham Dashwood a retired judge played by Mr. Wilkinson and its the movies only moment of genuine drama--the camera perversely pulls back to a respectful distance. We see next to nothing of the encounter and hear nothing at all until later when Graham tells someone else about it. Lets also stipulate that Mr. Nighy is one of the great comic actors of any time. Here however hes a glum presence in a role of bleak passivity. Ms. Smith spends most of her screen time in a wheelchair complaining nastily about everything under the Jaipur sun. Dev Patel has been encouraged or allowed by the director John Madden to overact wildly and wave his arms grotesquely as the hotels desperate young proprietor. Only Ms. Dench gets to play a scene worthy of her gifts. Her character Evelyn Greenslade has gone out and hustled herself a job at an Indian call center; suddenly shes plunged into the witty give and take of teaching a young Indian woman how to keep a client on the line. The scene is about listening well thinking quickly and responding creatively. Unlike the rest of this inert film its alive. First Position Watch a clip from the documentary First Position which follows six young ballet dancers as they prepare for one of the worlds most prestigious ballet competitions. (Video Sundance Select) Bess Kargmans debut documentary is a marvelous way to spend 94 minutes provided youre willing to spend them with your heart in your mouth. The subject is young dancers seeking awards validation and elite contracts in a ballet competition called the Youth America Grand Prix which holds its final round in Manhattan. In structure the film is a real-life ""Billy Elliot"" but the familiar formula doesnt exclude breathtaking surprises. Beneath the jetes and bleeding feet ""First Position"" is about toughness of mind as much as visions of beauty. In one case its about a transformation so profound as to be unfathomable. ENLARGE Rebecca Houseknecht. at center in First Position. Sundance Selects That distinction belongs to Michaela DePrince. A black war orphan from Sierra Leone she was adopted at the age of four and brought into a very large very white New Jersey family. When she recalls the horrors of her first four years she does so matter-of-factly ""Everywhere you looked you saw someone die...one time I tried to save my teacher but they just came and cut her arms and legs off."" Michaelas arms and legs are strong; so is her compact body. What she wants might seem out of reach for a young woman of her specific physique--""to be a delicate black dancer who does ballet."" Yet delicacy is in the mind and muscles of the dancer and Michaela has already proved that nothing is beyond her reach. ENLARGE From the same film Michaela DePrince and director Bess Kargman. Sundance Selects Ms. Kargmans strategy is straightforward--follow six contestants as they make their way through the semifinals and the finals where everything theyve learned everything theyve worked for and everything they can do must be distilled into a few fleeting moments on stage. There are crushing failures of course but also thrilling successes. In one of those success stories the camera follows a contestant to London where a scholarship awaits at the Royal Ballet and where it is noted in passing two of the ballet companys adjacent buildings are connected by an aerial passageway called the Bridge of Aspiration. Everyone in the film has come to such a bridge and everyone has crossed it. Here You must be willing to give yourself to Braden Kings debut feature a slow meandering and sumptuously photographed road trip combined with an intimate love story. I gave and I got. A lot. Watch a clip from ""Here"" starring Ben Foster Peter Coyote and Lubna Azabal. (Video Strand Releasing) The setting is Armenia where Will an American mapmaker played by Ben Foster meets Gadarine an expatriate photographer. Shes played by Lubna Azabal the actress who gave a glorious grand-operatic performance in ""Incendies."" Ms. Azabal is much more restrained in ""Here"" but extraordinary all the same. And Mr. Foster is fine in an inward way that defines his character. Will works for a satellite-mapping company. Solitary in nature and obsessed by precision he connects satellite images to the right places on the ground. Gadarine makes images too but theyre filled with faces and life and they tell human stories. ENLARGE Ben Foster and Lubna Azabal in Here Strand Releasing In other words two people who are polar opposites when it comes to mapping their worlds. Inevitably and poetically one approach gives way to the other. I wont say which trumps which but I can tell you that Gadarine doesnt end up working for Google Earth and that the filmmaker Mr. King has a gift for telling a story through meditative images. (Lol Crawley did the cinematography.) ""Here"" is intentionally underdramatized and occasionally sententious but intensely felt. Whenever Will and Gadarene touch they are truly touched. 2 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

The witty script Eastern locale and tony cast may summon up memories of the old Merchant-Ivory films and director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) manages his prestigious players well enough that you may even find yourself lighting on phrases like ""tradition of quality."" I was often pulled out of the story by thinking how pleased the actors must have been to get this project which may be another way of saying the movie isnt as good as its intentions.

By Peter Rainer / Film critic May 4 2012 Save for later Saved Marigold star Judi Dench (l.) works so intuitively with co-star Bill Nighy that they barely need dialogue in their scenes together. Ishika Mohan/Fox Searchlight Films/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In proud defiance of the prevailing anti-oldster trend in movies we have ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" a film that features just about nothing but oldsters. Fortunately for everybody they are played by a gift-pack assortment of world-class British actors including Maggie Smith Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson and Judi Dench.Without such a bang-up cast ""Marigold Hotel"" might have descended far more often than it does into terminal sappiness. The material based on Deborah Moggachs novel ""These Foolish Things"" is larded with life lessons one can see coming a mile away.We are quickly introduced to our players. Meek Douglas (Nighy) and his snippy wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) have lost their retirement savings in their daughters failed Internet start-up. Old coot Norman (Ronald Pickup) is still trying to pass himself off as a 40-something on dating sites. Randy Madge (Celia Imrie) doesnt want to be a stay-at-home grandmother. Recently widowed Evelyn (Dench) faced with her late husbands catastrophic debts doesnt want to move in with her sons. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Respected high court judge Graham (Wilkinson) is set to retire. Recently let go by her long-term employers housekeeper Muriel (Smith) needs an expensive hip replacement operation. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide In response to an ad for a ""luxury development for residents in their golden years"" all of these people find themselves on the same flight bound for India. The accommodations in Jaipur of course turn out to be anything but luxe despite the best intentions of its proprietor Sonny (Dev Patel of ""Slumdog Millionaire"") to make it seem otherwise. Sonny who inherited the now run-down establishment from his father has problems of his own a gorgon of a mother (Lillete Dubey) and a modern girlfriend (Tena Desae) she strongly disapproves of.It will come as no surprise that everybodys life issues get smoothed out but some of the buffing and polishing is deft. Evelyn whose blog entries heard in voice-over provide a running commentary warms to the unhappily married Douglas. Nighy and Dench work so intuitively together that they dont really need dialogue - their body language does it all. Muriel who is initially presented as a racist crone gradually warms to India and its people. This transition is too abrupt and predictable but Smith is so extraordinary that it doesnt matter much. We await Muriels transformation as we might savor Scrooges redemption at the end of ""A Christmas Carol."" And because Smith is playing a working-class woman for a change she gives her characters grievances and disappointments an especially gritty texture.Best of all is Wilkinsons performance as the magistrate who we quickly learn is returning after 40 years to the India he spent his privileged childhood in. Grahams return is highly purposeful He wants to track down the man who was the love of his youth. When they were caught out the young mans family was ostracized and Graham was packed off to college in England.Entranced once again by Indias glorious all-consuming bustle Graham goes about his mission with single-minded verve. But there is also a sense of loss of leave-taking in his pursuit. The melancholy vicissitudes of age and regret are imprinted upon him. Wilkinson accomplishes all this without the slightest trace of special pleading.As storytellers director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") and his screenwriter Ol Parker are way too schematic and they keep far too much of the action within the crumbly confines of the hotel. India itself becomes not much more than a vibrant theatrical backdrop. ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is an ersatz experience a commingling of forced uplift and exotica but its moving anyway. Like its characters we want to hold on to the dream that all will come out right in the end if we only check into the right address. Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for sexual content and language.)

But the feat of these Dames and gents is that they transcend the traces of cutesy yuck (like Viagra acquisition and a septuagenarian tendency to be baffled by technology) and turn this senior citizen version of Enchanted April or Love Actually into a charming celebration of aging. There are brutal truths about the declining years in Best Exotic from loneliness to financial woes that cant be solved by getting a new job but they are amply padded with comedy and cheery messages about acceptance; this is no bitter pill to swallow. The retirees seven in all are summoned to the Best Exotic Marigold by enterprising young Sonny (Slumdog Millionaires Dev Patel still cute still bland) who has a dream to ""outsource old age"" by bringing old people unwanted in their own country to live in India. Hell start with the English and expand from there. As he tells his disapproving mother ""other countries dont like old people either."" (READ Maggie Smith and Harry Potters other Great British Thespians) Most of the guests are financially insecure and Madden (Shakespeare in Love) doesnt shy away from a pointed message; England has become a cold hard place to be old. (Ol Parker wrote the screenplay adapting Deborah Moggachs novel These Foolish Things.) Evelyns (Dench in a welcome change playing vulnerable) recently deceased husband racked up years of debt; the sheltered housewife has had to sell her flat and needs to take a job at a call center to be able to afford the Best Exotic. Retired civil servant Douglas (Nighy) and his grasping wife Jean (the uncannily good Penelope Wilton) invested in their daughters startup and are left with nothing. Retired maid Muriel ""Mrs. Donnelly"" (Smith) needed a new hip; India was the cheapest fastest place to get one. Norman (Ronald Pickup) and Madge (Celia Imrie) are both randy and single generally a toxic comic combination in cinema but Madden blends the comedy with enough compassion to make them endearing. ""Ive still got it"" Norman says. ""I just cant find anyone who wants it."" This notion of being done against their will plagues all of the characters to some degree or other. Theyre all on quests. High court judge Graham (Wilkinson in one of his most tender performances) is looking for a lost love others quietly hope for new loves security and opportunities to feel useful in the world beyond babysitting for their grandchildren. Its the varied degree of their adaptations to sensual seedy India that drives the story with Evelyn providing an elderly Carrie Bradshaw-style narration via her blog (which she posts on the ""Interweb""). Graham grew up in colonized India and sees good all around him in ""the light the colors the smiles the way people see life as a privilege and not a right."" The shrewish Jean poses the greatest contrast fussing about the food and refusing to leave the hotel (sidenote she spends most of her days reading Moggachs Tulip Fever). Her beleaguered husband Douglas who forms an easy bond with Evelyn falls somewhere in between. ""One wants to trust in general"" he says. ""But you never really know."" One doesnt. One has to take a chance you see. The pronoun ""one"" is tossed about a lot here but the movie has the self-awareness to joke about it as well as the British tendency to whither. While Smith is playing someone far afield socially from Downton Abbeys Dowager Countess she never misses a chance to look down her nose. ""Words fail me"" Mrs. Donnelly says when asked about the accommodations at the Best Exotic. Not as weapons they dont. ""He can wash all he wants that color isnt coming out"" she says of  a black doctor. This is the nastiest character Smith has played in years and Best Exotic is at its weakest when trying to persuade us Mrs. Donnelly can open her mind. (If Wilton well known for her Downton Abbey character sanctimonious cousin Isobel were playing Mrs. Donnelly youd want to push her wheelchair off a balcony.) But Smith...God shes good. The woman milks our affection for her so expertly that I nearly found myself shifting obediently to the idea of Mrs. Donnellys reform. Ive adopted a binge policy where she and Dench are concerned. Both of them will turn 78 this year. While they are still working Ill take every opportunity to see them perform particularly together. They have shared the screen (and stage) before in A Room with a View Tea with Mussolini and most recently in 2004s Ladies in Lavender where they played sisters but Best Exotic still feels like an occasion. It may be geared to the over-60 set but unlike last months ode to aging Darling Companion it is by no means limited to that group. ""It will make you want to be old"" a publicist chirped on my way in. I am fairly sure I shot her a disbelieving look but I did walk out thinking spending the end of my days hanging out with Smith and Dench drinking tea in our sumptuous and capacious paisley tunics at the Best Exotic would be pretty sweet.

"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel review A life passage to India |       NJ.com comments The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel review A life passage to India Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 03 2012 at 1115 PM updated May 07 2012 at 527 PM View/Post Comments (FOX SEARCHLIGHT)Judi Dench is an Englishwoman abroad in ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" When I was a poor student the cheapest way to feel rich was to go to an Indian restaurant. It wasnt just that the entree itself was inexpensive. It was that it came with its own royal retinue of side dishes. By the time every last chutney was put down on the table you felt like a king. ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" approaches storytelling with the same kind of careful overkill. Fond of grand old British actresses? It gives you both Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. Adore veteran British actors? You get both the decent serious sort in Tom Wilkinson and the wry lightly self-mocking kind in Bill Nighy. Want a story about some pensioned-off lonely retirees discovering theyre not so useless - or loveless - as they think? ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" gives you about half-a-dozen. It gives you too much in fact - there are two stories here that really dont go anywhere and whose characters disappear for long periods of time without leaving a hole. A little less excess might have helped. Some fresher spices too. A few characters remain bland and a couple of the jokes feel rather older than the cast. Still its hard to complain too much when your leads are Dench and Smith Nighy and Wilkinson - all giving an actors master class in the power of doing just enough. The plot imagines that a group of mostly cash-strapped retirees - all strangers to each other -- have decided to outsource their golden years to India where a lush new hotel has just opened its doors and their pension checks are likely to go quite a bit further. Once they get there of course it turns out that the hotel isnt all it promised to be. And a few of its new guests are a long way from retiring in every sense of the word. Smith gets the worst-written part - a racist who by the end of the film is suddenly full of human kindness - but she puts her big eyes to work and almost carries it off. Wilkinson is very good too as a wealthy man who has his own reasons for moving to the subcontinent. As for Dench looking lovelier than ever - with her shining silver hair and bright blue eyes shes like a bit of native jewelry - she finds the pain and pride in this recent widow. And blue-blazer dapper even in the heat of Jaipur Nighy resurrects the sort of quietly moral doggedly decent hero we havent seen in years. It would have been nice to have seen more of them and their adventures and less of some of the other actors - particularly Dev Patel who plays the young entrepreneur behind the hotel. Both incompetent and obsequious hes a cringeworthy character to begin with and Patel does nothing to move him beyond caricature. But then thats the thing about these Indian feasts - not every side dish is for every taste. All you can do is push past the few that disappoint concentrate on the many that delight and try to enjoy the generously portioned and prettily laid out experience. Ratings note The film contains strong language and sexual situations. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (PG-13) Fox Searchlight (122 min.) Directed by John Madden. With Judi Dench Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson Maggie Smith. Now playing in New York.

The audience also will fall under its spell spun mostly by the venerable actors easily some of the U.K.s best.Based on the novel by Deborah Moggach about a group of British retirees who opt to ""outsource"" their retirement to less pricey digs the film is by turns spry hopeful and contemplative -- much like its characters.STORY Judi Dench fellow Brits check in to Marigold HotelVIDEO Marigold NYC premiereMORE Dev Patel discusses working with cast of MarigoldThe retirees have a few things in common They are slightly lost souls in search of reinvention and a rewarding life in their sunset years. A few seek adventure others seek human connection and some just want the luxury they cant afford in England and believe theyll find at a hotel aimed at ""the elderly and beautiful."" But theres the rub The Marigold Hotel bears little resemblance to the palatial photos featured in its ads.Hotel manager Sonny (Slumdog Millionaires Dev Patel) has big dreams impeccable manners and a prodigious vocabulary. But his ambitions outstrip his finances. His goal is to convert his late fathers struggling hotel fallen into disrepair into a place of such appeal that the folks who move there will simply refuse to die.About the movieThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel out of fourStars Maggie Smith Judi Dench Tom Wilkinson Bill Nighy Penelope Wilton Dev Patel Penelope Wilton Celia Imrie Director John MaddenDistributor Fox Searchlight Pictures Rating PG-13 for sexual content and language Running time 1 hour 58 minutes Opens today in select citiesThough the place has an impressive courtyard and great bones it lacks such basics as bedroom doors functional faucets and connected telephones. Forget about amenities.Some of the British expats take these limitations in stride focusing on the exotic landscape and the friendly locals. Others find them endlessly irritating.In the latter category is Muriel (Maggie Smith). She has gone to India mostly for the low-cost hip replacement surgery. She arrives as a crotchety closed-minded racist but India has an intriguing effect on her.The only married couple among the group is sharply divided in their view of life in Jaipur. Douglas (Bill Nighy) embraces his surroundings while his wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) is perennially sour.Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a bereaved and cash-strapped widow. She pluckily refuses an offer to move in with her son in Britain masters the computer and begins writing a blog in which she muses ""The only real failure is the failure to try."" And within that context she has succeeded as have her compatriots.Graham (Tom Wilkinson) is a retired judge with a deeply personal reason for coming to India where he spent his childhood years. Madge (Celia Imrie) is looking for love -- provided it comes with deep pockets. Also seeking romance is randy Norman Cousins (ostensibly named for the American author) and played by Ron Pickup which is a perfect last name for his ambitions in the film.The film is about 15 minutes too long and the path of Douglas and Jeans marriage seems unlikely as presented. The story ties up neatly in the happily-ever-after vein of fairy tales.A delightful droll and entertaining comedy of manners with an estimable cast The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel offers an ideal low-tech alternative to the special-effects laden Avengers.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 04 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English A group of British retirees answer an ad for an Indian ""luxury development for residents in their golden years"" and ends up in a dilapidated hotel in Jaipur India in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Nominally dealing with the phenomenon of ""outsourcing"" seniors to retire in more affordable countries this drama-comedy from Shakespeare in Love director John Madden features a cast thats pure British sterling A couple of Dames - Maggie Smith and Judi Dench - along with Tom Wilkinson and Billy Nighy just to start. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" starring Maggie Smith Judi Dench Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy Movies The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel The official trailer Unfortunately the script based on Deborah Moggachs 2004 novel These Foolish Things might better be described as pure British stodge high-starch English comfort food of more sentimental than nutritional value. Were introduced to each of these senior tourists along with their personal baggage in a brisk series of opening montages. Dench plays Evelyn who discovers after her husbands death that the spouse who promised to care for her has left her in debt and homeless. Her emotional awakening in India is recorded on her voice-over blog which pops up periodically throughout the film. Among the slower converts to the charms of India is Smiths Muriel a Cockney domestic who ran a household until she was fired for her age. In spite of her anti-Indian bigotry she has come here for cheap hip-replacement surgery. Nighy plays Douglas the nobly passive husband of the shrewish spouse Jean (Penelope Wilton); theyre living in reduced means after giving their life savings to their daughters Web start-up company. Wilkinson is Graham a former judge who spent his youth in India and has some unfinished business. For would-be semi-comic relief theres Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup as a couple of aging singles on the prowl Shes looking for a rich husband to carry her through her golden years hes looking for a late-life fling to warm the cockles of his heart. Each of the seven characters has a slightly different attitude toward the sensory assault and complexity of India with the nervous Jean and Muriel hiding out in the hotel compound while others venture forth and allow themselves to be transformed. The lifelong bachelor Graham tracks down an old love - oh just guess the surprise. Evelyn even manages to get a job at the call centre advising Indian phone operators on how to converse with cranky old English people. On the Indian side we have Slumdog Millionaires Dev Patel as Sonny overplaying the young hotelier with wise sayings and exaggerated servility. Naturally he has his own burdens His pretty girlfriend works at a call centre but his mother has an arranged marriage for him. Among his staff is a maid in the hotel an untouchable whom the xenophobic Muriel after correcting her sweeping technique recognizes as a kindred soul. So much adorableness wears out its welcome fairly quickly and at more than two hours Marigold Hotel is not a short movie. No doubt the virtuoso cast isnt bad company to kill time - from Smiths patented indignant eye-roll to Nighys stretched-out comic reaction takes - but the pacing runs counter to the movies message that time is too precious to waste. With its stereotypical characters and creaky plot turns this passage to India feels even longer than its running time.

Starring Bill Nighy Maggie Smith Judi Dench Tom Wilkinson Dev Patel Penelope Wilton Celia Imrie Russell Balogh Liza Tarbuck Lillete Dubey Director John Madden Running time 158 Release Opened May 4 2012  Editorial Review This tour group is pretty humdrumBy Michael OSullivanFriday May 4 2012A blandly middling crowd pleaser ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" follows a group of seven English retirees who have taken up residence in a seedy Indian boarding house. The entertainment that one is able to derive from it is directly proportional to the appeal of each character. Those levels vary widely. At the delightful end of the spectrum is Judi Denchs Evelyn a recent widow whose loneliness and hard-won wisdom is rendered in an affectingly nuanced performance by the great British actress. At the other end is Maggie Smiths Muriel a nakedly racist coot rendered in a strident one-note caricature by the otherwise great British actress. How strange to see this pair of dames - who shone together in the 2004 ""Ladies in Lavender"" - at such odds. To be fair its less Smiths fault than the scripts. Based on the book ""These Foolish Things"" by Deborah Moggach Ol Parkers screenplay gives Smith little room to breathe or to breathe life into what is essentially a cliche the crotchety old biddy. Shes not the only one either. Penelope Wiltons Jean is equally unpleasant her face contorted in a mask of constant misery. ""All you give out is endless negativity"" complains Jeans long-suffering husband Douglas (Bill Nighy). Hes right about that. Douglas is one of the more interesting characters and his growing friendship with Evelyn is one of the films pleasures. Another fascinating performance is Tom Wilkinsons Graham a bachelor lawyer who once lived in India as a young man. Graham has returned for a very specific - and ultimately heartbreaking - reason. Ronald Pickups Norman is essentially the ensembles clown the lovably dirty old man. Celia Imries Madge on the other hand elicits no strong feelings either way. Rounding out the cast is Dev Patel as the hotels inept manager. A side story about his romance with a pretty call-center operator (Tena Desae) only makes the film busier with Patel emoting as if he were playing Shakespeare in the Park. Some viewers may respond to the films message that its never too late for love. Others may groan at its reliance on paleolithic vaudeville humor. ""At my age"" Muriel says ""I dont even buy green bananas."" Colonialist stereotypes also abound India is dirty and inefficient and the food will give you the runs. A scene of the seven main characters rushing in and out of the loo after dinner is enough to induce indigestion in the audience. That said the film is neither terrible nor great despite moments at both extremes. That shouldnt come as any surprise considering that its director John Madden made both ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""Captain Corellis Mandolin."" I could watch a whole movie about Evelyn Douglas and Graham. If only the other characters didnt keep wandering onto the set spoiling everything. Contains brief obscenity and some sexual humor.

Photo by Ishika Mohan Photo Ishika Mohan Fox Searchlight Best Exotic Marigold Hotel review Agings truth 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Drama. Starring Judi Dench Bill Nighy Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson. Directed by John Madden. (PG-13. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) What a drag it is getting old - especially for the generation that once went around singing ""What a drag it is getting old."" ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is a movie about a specific variety of old age what could be called early old age. The characters in this latest film from John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") are not decrepit and most still have romantic aspirations. Yet they have the sense that time is getting shorter as well as a bewildered awareness that the world might be passing them by or getting ready to. And as they are from a culture and an era that values youth they see no compensation in old age and cant even pretend at any wisdom beyond resignation. The film brings together a handful of people from various conditions of life and places them in a funky old hotel in the hectic Indian city of Jaipur. Some of the residents are broke and think they might want to settle in India where Western money goes far and some are there for other reasons. If there is an unintended lesson in this movie its this old favorite Dont get old with no money. Provide provide. Intriguing stories There are two other possible lessons Indias a colorful place for a travelogue and Dev Patel who plays the hyper hotel manager has more in him than ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Perhaps I should admit that a part of me just wants to keep ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" at a distance because there is something about it so glum and hangdog - and hangdog in that distinctly British expect-nothing-from-life sort of way - that Id rather not believe it. Id rather not believe that just being 70 for example is so inherently miserable that it gives people no choice but to be contemplative angry or pathetic. In this case we define pathetic as seemingly happy but in a way that incites pity not envy. Yet ""Marigold Hotel"" is too well made to be dismissed and contains too much truth to be scorned. Based on a novel by Deborah Moggach the screenplay takes a half-dozen stories and mingles them and yet each characters through-line is effective on its own. Theres Tom Wilkinson quite moving as a man who returns to India after 40 years to seek out the lover of his youth. Theres Judi Dench - truly lovely and completely open here - as a grieving widow with money troubles. And Maggie Smith as a former maid (with the demeanor of a duchess) recovering from a hip replacement. Less cuddly but easily as interesting is Penelope Wilton as a bitter status-conscious woman who is so mired in negativity that she cant escape it. Even when she tries to sound festive something hostile or twisted comes out of her mouth. As horrible as she is you end up feeling sorry for her because you can tell she cant stop and you can almost feel physically her self-disgust. Bill Nighy plays her poor husband slinking about like someone pounded thin by years of abuse. Rare reminder Along the way the movie provides a detailed glimpse of Jaipur - the buses and bicycles the livestock in the street the zigzagging traffic. Visually arresting but once again Save for retirement; you dont want to live there. Mixed in with the old folks the movie follows the story of the would-be innkeeper (Patel) and the girl he wants to marry (Tena Desae) and so the cycle of passion goes on and on. It never stops. ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is a rare reminder from movies that the grand emotions are not only for the young and the middle-aged. Theyre the sweetness and torment of life until the last light goes out.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; best-exotic-marigold-hotel-the ) Best Exotic Marigold Hotel The (United Kingdom 2012) May 03 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is one of those pleasant inoffensive British movies that offers a passably entertaining two hours without providing material that could be construed as edgy or stimulating. The problem may be that its a little too pleasant and inoffensive. Its soft in the middle and doesnt earn all the happy endings. Character arcs are warped to satisfy the needs of the plot not because it makes sense for them to develop as they do. The movie is suffused with instances of droll humor all of which is familiar and as a result not especially funny. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is for those who have an affinity for lighthearted predictable drama featuring some of the best actors working in the U.K. The movie is essentially one long fish-out-of-water production although romantic comedy elements can be found seeping through some of the cracks. The unusual thing about The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is that the youngest member of the primary seven is 60 years old. Its rare for a movie - any movie - to lean so heavily on such an elderly cast. A little youth is injected via Slumdog Millionaires Dev Patel and Tena Desae but they are supporting players. Still as one might expect from a group of actors in this age range the performances are impeccable. Experience does count. The story transplants seven older citizens of the U.K. to Jaipur with the lure of spending their retirements in splendor and comfort at The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly amp; Beautiful which is described as a ""luxury development where all the residents are in their Golden Years"" - like Florida ""but with more elephants."" Evelyn (Judi Dench) a widow has never been much of a traveler but after 40 years of marriage she decides a change is needed. Graham (Tom Wilkinson) has unfinished business in India where he lived as a young man. Douglas and Jean Ainslie (Billy Nighy and Penelope Wilson) are forced to find an inexpensive place to live after Douglas loses his savings in a bad stock deal. Norman (Ronald Pickup who replaced Peter OToole when the latter was unavailable) is looking for love or at least a little sex to spice up his late life. Madge (Celia Imre who replaced Julie Christie) is out for something similar although shes hoping to find someone with a small fortune. Finally theres Muriel (Maggie Smith) a bitter intolerant bigot who is in Mumbai for a hip replacement operation - they can do it cheaper and faster there than if she waited for it in England. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is run by Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) a young idealist who has grand views of what the rundown estate can become. His mother (Lillete Dubey) is less enthused about the hotels future potential earning power and while the coup of catering to seven guests is a big thing for Sonny his mother investigates how much can be made by selling the land. Meanwhile Sonny has relationship problems. His girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae) a call center operator is not viewed as being a ""suitable"" potential wife for Sonny and this creates friction. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel gives each of the character a storyline to pursue some of which are more ambitious than others. The most substantive role belongs to Judi Dench; Evelyns blogs about life in India become the movies voiceover narration. Because her husband left debts she has nothing to live on and is forced to get a job. Veteran director John Madden has previously worked with Dench (Shakespeare in Love Mrs. Brown) and recognizes her versatility. His decision to provide her with the centerpiece part is well founded. Shes the center of gravity around which everyone else orbits. Although Maddens camera captures the chaotic flow of life in Mumbai the movie gets surprisingly little traction out of its fish-out-of-water premise. This is not an Indian Crocodile Dundee. Evelyn and Douglas spend a lot of time exploring while Jean uncomfortable in such unfamiliar surroundings and nursing a crush on Graham hides out in the hotel. For the most part however the characters adjust with little difficulty. Graham reveals a secret. Douglas and Jeans marriage begins to come apart. Norman and Madge troll upscale clubs for potential mates. Muriel is transformed from a bitter woman into a caring open-minded one (a transition that is not remotely believable). And Evelyn plays a part in just about all of these stories while finding a job as a ""cultural adviser"" at one of the omnipresent call centers. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is content to tell small stories in a big country. Its not ambitious opting to rely on good acting and happy endings to justify the viewers time and money. It should do well in art houses but it targets viewers who often wait for home video to see movies. Fox Searchlight has selected May 4 2012 as its U.S. opening day releasing it opposite The Avengers. If there ever was an ""anti-Avengers"" movie this is it. The movies demographics are mutually exclusive. Those who will see The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel are looking for something calm safe gently humorous and entirely unchallenging. And thats exactly what they get.

And so we have ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" in which a handful of pensioners set off to retire in India where they learn life lessons fall in love and get a second chance at being useful. Its basically a feel-good fantasy for the Rascal set but ""Marigold"" proves itself rather hard to resist from the colorful sun-soaked delights of Jaipur (as captured by cinematographer Ben Davis) to a cast of heavy-hitters who know how to take the slight screenplay by Oliver Parker (based on a novel by Deborah Maggoch) and spin it into comedic and even dramatic gold. When a luxury retirement village called The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly amp; Beautiful begins advertising its services in the United Kingdom it piques the interest of several retirees. Widow Evelyn (Judi Dench) hopes to start her life over independent for the first time; Douglas (Bill Nighy) and his perpetually furious wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) are looking to economize after Douglas lost their savings investing in an internet start-up; Graham (Tom Wilkinson) looks forward to returning to the India of his youth to settle some unfinished business; and senior singletons Madge (Celia Imrie) and Norman (Ronald Pickup) are hot to trot but decidedly not with each other. And then theres the grumpy and outspokenly racist Muriel (Maggie Smith) whos had her hip surgery outsourced by the National Health Service as part of a pilot program. Armed with a carry-on bag full of pickles and chocolate biscuits shes determined to hightail it out of India as soon as shes recovered. Upon arrival the Brits discover that hotelier Sonny (Dev Patel) has exaggerated the hotels amenities even its structural soundness but they all adjust in varying degrees. Over the course of a few weeks hearts will be opened and broken new opportunities will avail themselves and these codgers will discover that life has more to offer than the script theyve been handed as senior citizens. Theres not much daring or unpredictable about anything that unfolds here but director John Madden (""The Debt"" ""Shakespeare in Love"") has assembled an extraordinary cast and bends over backwards to keep the proceedings as crowd-pleasing as possible. The result is a movie that isnt going to redefine cinema for anyone but will nonetheless make perfect counter-programming against ""The Avengers."" (And if youre looking for a movie to take mom to for Mothers Day this might be just the ticket.) Madden straddles the line when it comes to portraying India; he never makes the country look a colonial hellhole nor does buff Jaipurs rougher edges or turn the movie into a postcard-pretty travelogue. His modern approach is perhaps best captured in a market scene where Douglas tries teaching Evelyn how to haggle only to discover that that sort of bargaining went out with Kipling and old Hollywood movies. Dench and Wilkinson are given the most to do and they make the most of the opportunity but no one here is phoning it in. The whole cast of pros knows exactly how to milk a laugh here or pause for poignancy there and by the end its hard not to be carried along by a movie that offers not one single surprise. Its a cup of tea made no less satisfying by the fact that youll know how its going to taste every sip of the way. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Movie review The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-RetirementMovie review The Best Exotic Marigold HotelThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel blooms with a strong British cast whose characters move to India for their golden years only to find the surroundings filled with the unexpected.May 04 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Tena Desae and Dev Patel star in ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" (Ishika Mohan / Fox Searchlight )""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel""is an affectionately told comedy about a bunch of English retirees who trade a bleak British future for an elegant retirement hotel in the middle of India one that promises to make those final years truly golden a and for a fraction of the price at home.Sounds like a dream or a scheme and in truth its a bit of both as neither life nor the ""Marigold Hotel"" turn out exactly as one might wish. But when the bags are packed with pride prejudice problems and prospects by some of Britainsbest a including Judi Dench Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson and Maggie Smith a it makes the trip worth taking. Complementing all that aging grace is Dev Patel the breakout star of""Slumdog Millionaire"" as the irrepressible young owner of the Marigold. Aptly named Sonny he is trying ever so hard to gloss over any rough patches a at the hotel and in his life or his guests. It all makes for a movie whose infectious charm outweighs some of the predictability that slips in around the edges.While the films infrastructure may be creaky at times not unlike the leaking faucets and crumbling rooms of the aging Marigold Hotel its heart is solid gold. It starts with director John Madden who is always adept at spinning a yarn; here he has completely embraced the whimsy of screenwriter Ol Parkers adaptation of Deborah Moggachs novel ""These Foolish Things"" about ""outsourcing"" ones retirement to India. That countrys Rajasthan region where the film is set lends its exotic temples emerging industry and teeming humanity to provide a vibrant backdrop and its beautifully shot by cinematographer Ben Davis who last worked with the director on""The Debt"" which was released in the U.S. last year.After a rough trip a airport delays and a bus ride that would have cowed more youthful mortals a the group of seven strangers turns up on the Marigold Hotels steps. Most come from Britains not-quite-upper-crust and there are early snapshots of the lives they are leaving to set up things.Evelyn (Dench) who will become the central voice of the film as she launches a blog to record her India adventure is a recent widow who finds the husband she trusted left her with debts she never imagined. Graham (Wilkinson) is the youngest a 50ish judge who opts for early retirement to deal with unresolved issues in India where he lived as a boy and first fell in love. Providing most of the conflict are the long-married ill-matched Douglas (Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton). Completing the set a the filmmakers want to make sure they have all the types covered a is the never-married Muriel (Smith) who managed someone elses household affairs and is facing a hip replacement and the saucy singles Madge (Celia Imrie) and Norman (Ronald Pickup) both still hoping to score a rich mate.One by one each character faces life-changing and challenging moments which require that they either embrace or reject the possibility of transformation. Sonny has his own trials a how to save the hotel and win the heart of his girlfriend and obtain his mothers acceptance of both a though with the ebullient optimism that Patel lets vibrate through Sonny it is hard to believe that things wont eventually turn out fine.This exceptional ensemble makes aging in exotic climes feel effortlessly real never over-reaching appropriately fraught. Dench in particular paints a moving portrait of Evelyn as she navigates the empowerment of landing her first job a helping train those ubiquitous Indian telemarketers a and her sometimes paralyzing fear that she might not be up to the task. Madden brings just the right light touch much as he did in the royal treat of ""Shakespeare in Love"" which won seven Oscars including best picture in 1999.The message of ""Marigold"" is ultimately one of hope that its never too late to find yourself and possibly your soul mate a that there is time to rewrite the final chapters of your life. All that uplift amid the rubble could turn saccharine but it rarely does. Instead ""Marigold"" makes you believe that despite the ups and downs the aches and pains sometimes life can indeed get better with age.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNew Releases The Cabin in the Woods is smart scarySeptember 15 2012Word of Mouth Fox Searchlight hopes seniors check into...May 3 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTRetirementDebtCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-20120504,0,5777330.story",200,thebestexoticmarigoldhotel17,thebestexoticmarigoldhotel,latimes

They find themselves alone in what hapless fast-talking owner Sonny (""Slumdog Millionaires"" Dev Patel) advertised as a bustling lively guesthouse. He implores them to stay in his decrepit palace Unless the business thrives he will lose his chance to marry the girl he loves. The Brits natural reserve wanes and soon they have their noses in each others business sharing lessons about marriage love friendship sexual orientation social nuances adult children and failures on the stock exchange. There are still vestiges of friction between British colonialism and Indian nationalism. Smith takes the acting honors (the competition is not blistering) as a spiteful intolerant old thing outsourced to a nearby clinic for a hip replacement. Her horror at being handled by the local doctors is funny and awful all at once. She is the only character that hasnt been smothered beneath a blanket of gentility. Wilkinson plays a judge with a not-very-hard-to-guess secret life Dench is a plucky widow and Nighy is a timid stammering fellow under the thumb of his domineering missus (Penelope Wilton). None is very engaging and most of the supporting cast play passive cozy ever-accommodating South Asian stereotypes. The whole banal mess feels as if it was lifted from the platitudinous blog in which Denchs character records her musings.

The lonely seniors have two things in common the usual big-screen bucket-list array of wishes for love sex closure and adventure -- or at a minimum retirement without total penury -- and the fact that theyre all played by the cream of todays British acting talent albeit mostly operating below full steam. Beyond that the members of this disappointed crew stranded in the decrepit ruins of a formerly grand mansion fall into one of two categories youve met many a time before Englishmen abroad (rarely a pretty sight) and affirmative life-lovers who are up for anything. (No prizes whatsoever for guessing where Maggie Smith our reigning queen of Grumpy and Surly lands.) Resplendent in a pungent lower-middle class twang and bags of belligerent attitude Smith plays Muriel a former nanny whose bitterness at having been thrown on the trash heap by her former employers has brought out the robust xenophobe in her. Shes come to a place where the aged are cherished rather than consigned to oblivion luckily -- but Muriel has come to India unwillingly and she has no faith in the long-suffering Indian surgeons who capably replace her hip at bargain rates or in the Untouchable domestic who shows her a kindness her own family has never done. Matching Smith kvetch for kvetch is the great Penelope Wilton as a snooty luxury-loving matron who despite the enormous advantage of being married to Bill Nighy refuses to leave the hotel for fear of contamination by the great unwashed of Jaipur. When Smith and Wilton (who faced off deliciously in the first two seasons of Downton Abbey) are doing their testy old bird thing The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is frisky angry irreverent and fun. Otherwise its gentle sweet inspiring and a bit flabby with a terrific cast reduced to beige shades of nice. (Who can watch Nighy playing a downtrodden husband without yearning for a cathartic burst of the mad aging rocker he aced in Love Actually?) Movie Interviews Slumdog Star Dev Patel In Good Company At A Distant Hotel Tom Wilkinson is reliable as ever as Graham a retired judge whos come to India on impulse to seek out a long-lost love. And other old faithfuls include a much-married grandmother (Celia Imrie) of exceedingly high libido and a game old gent (Ronald Pickup) trying to pretend hes still Don Juan if indeed he ever was. Judi Dench a dame with an edge if ever there was one bears up valiantly as Evelyn a recently widowed homemaker who left penniless by her beloved late husband finds herself a job in Jaipur. This being movie-India a call center shows up on cue only here the customer-service representatives are urgently in need of social-skills training from Evelyn just as the boys playing cricket in the street eagerly lap up batting tips from Graham. i Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) plays Sonny the optimistic manager of the Marigold whos in love with Sunaina (Tena Desae). Ishika Mohan/Fox Searchlight hide caption toggle caption Ishika Mohan/Fox Searchlight Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) plays Sonny the optimistic manager of the Marigold whos in love with Sunaina (Tena Desae). Ishika Mohan/Fox Searchlight In return India -- chiefly represented by the eternally optimistic young hotel manager played by Slumdog Millionaires Dev Patel -- offers these twitchy goal-oriented Brits light color terrible traffic and serene injunctions about living in the present. Old colonial habits die hard at least in a filmic vision of India thats woefully behind the curve of a country whose lively progress on many fronts far outstrips that of its former ruler. Adapted by Ol Parker from a popular -- and by all accounts more tough-minded and antic -- novel by Deborah Moggach The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is smoothly directed by John Madden (Shakespeare in Love). Its a sweet-tempered folly in which alls well that ends well. Heaven knows its target audience is an underserved market and perhaps a little wish fulfillment is in order at a time when many seniors face the dissipation of their life savings and a lot of media chat about palliative care.

The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is proof that art-house films can be as cliched and soggily sentimental as the big-ticket items playing at the multiplex. The comedy-drama follows a group of British retirees at a ramshackle hotel in Jaipur India and it stars just about every aging English actor who didnt make it into a ""Harry Potter"" movie and a few who did. For that reason alone ""Hotel"" will be a hit among upscale 50+ audiences since no one else is making movies for or about them. But its predictable fluff sometimes pleasantly so at others times irritatingly.Based on the 2004 novel ""These Foolish Things"" by Deborah Moggach and directed with sturdy dullness by John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"" ""The Debt"") ""Hotel"" briskly introduces us to its main characters and their problems. Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a recent widow struggling to learn to live for herself. Doug (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton) are an old married couple he shyly adventurous and she complaining. (Wiltons even more persnickety here than as Mrs. Crawley on ""Downton Abbey"").Madge (Celia Imrie) is a randy strumpet looking for a rich man; Norman (Ronald Pickup) is an old goat looking for a quickie. Graham (Tom Wilkinson) is returning to India to seek a long-lost love (there are complications). The most problematic character Muriel (Maggie Smith) is a vicious fusspot who arrives at the hotel to get a new hip; she has never had a good word to say about any person of any color other than a good English gray and you dont believe shes about to start.Theres a touch of ""If Its Tuesday This Must Be Rajasthan"" to ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" The assembled cast oohs and ahhs at Indias Day-Glo colors jammed streets and general sensory assault then draws up short when the hotel is reached. Its a work in progress to put it kindly and its owner-manager is a hyperactive young striver named Sonny. Dev Patel of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" does what he can with the role but its written just this side of brownface. (His girlfriend played by the lovely Tena Desae works at a customer service call center and thats the best the movie can do to acknowledge modern India -- the voice at the end of a Westerners phone.)Similarly the British actors work hard and invisibly to turn their character types into actual people. Its an uphill push despite their gifts. I would probably pay cash money to watch Bill Nighy read from the tax code and given Ol Parkers script that might be an improvement. The most preposterous development is Muriels transformation from a racist old biddy to the climactic scenes gracious dea ex machina. Its as if she went in for a new hip and came out with a character transplant.But thats how ""Hotel"" resolves its conflicts -- tidily and with resort to unexpected deaths last-minute declarations of love and 180-degree emotional flip-flops. It plays but youd have to be desperate to buy in. I dont begrudge the films target audience for that desperation or for a desire to see the search for fresh meaning in ones final acts portrayed onscreen. And if youve seen a gem like 2006s ""Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont"" you know it can be done with honesty delicacy humor and power. By contrast ""Hotel"" plays like the Disoriented Express.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter tyburr. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

Why should we care? The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Fair to good Director John Madden. Cast Tom Wilkinson Bill Nighy Judi Dench. Rating PG-13 for sexual content and language. We probably shouldnt because ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is rife with cliches and predictability. But when those folks include Tom Wilkinson Bill Nighy Maggie Smith and Judi Dench among others its almost impossible not to. As Penelope Wiltons pretentious Jean might say one wishes director John Madden and writer Ol Parker offered one a more surprising take on the story but when one takes into account that the film is based on Deborah Moggachs novel one is willing to overlook this at least in part. Interview Penelope Wilton Yes Jean talks like that a lot. Its annoying and meant to be. The desperately unhappy woman and her husband Douglas (Nighy) made a bad investment in their daughters software company. At a loss for what to do with the rest of their lives they like the rest of the bunch answered an ad for a luxury development for retirees in Jaipur India. Theyre joined by Muriel (Smith) a racist old housekeeper adrift now that she is no longer on the job and needs a new hip; Evelyn (Dench) who must sell her apartment to pay off her late husbands debts; Madge (Celia Imrie) on the hunt for a rich future husband; Norman (Ronald Pickup) on the hunt for sex and armed with Viagra; and Graham (Wilkinson) a gay judge who left the love of his life as a young man in Jaipur and is returning to resolve his guilt and regret. Once they get there they find not a luxury development but a crumbling old hotel run with more enthusiasm than expertise by Sonny (Dev Patel) who inherited the place from his father. If the dump looks like this one guest asks what are the beautiful pictures on the brochure? Ah that Sonny says in his always optimistic tone. That was a glimpse of the future. Everyone reacts differently to the place and to India but all do so in a manner as predictable as tea and biscuits in the afternoon. (We even learn the proper way to enjoy them as a matter of fact.) Evelyn and Douglas find a vibrancy in the chaos of the place; Norman a conquest (ha -- a Norman conquest); Graham a curiously timed resolution and so forth. Even Sonnys romance with the thoroughly modern Sunaina (Tena Desae) frowned upon by his tradition-bound mother (Lillete Dubey) is well-traveled ground. So no points for originality. Madden tries to make up for this with sheer British acting personality and nearly succeeds. They might not be doing groundbreaking work here but Dench Nighy Wilkinson and the rest are doing what they are given to do very well. (Those three do it best of all with enthusiasm patience and dignity.) Ask people who make movies and they will tell you that an actor can rise above a bad script but a movie cant. Thanks to the on-screen talent involved here this is probably about as close to making the latter happen as we could hope for. And yet we cant help hoping for more especially from this bunch. The parts are greater than the sum. ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" winds up playing like the coming together of a supergroup of classic rockers that never manages to live up to the individual work. Parts of it are catchy but it doesnt quite rock.

(Ishika Mohan) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday May 3 2012 1254 PM Title The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Film Info PG-13 Sexuality language. At the Angelika Clearview First amp; 62nd Lincoln Square ""I dont want to be condescended to"" a character declares emphatically in ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel."" Thats a perfectly reasonable desire and one that the movie promptly ignores. For some reason it seems to be nearly impossible for filmmakers to tackle issues of aging without resorting to the sort of patronizing cliches on which this adaptation of Deborah Moggachs novel (called ""These Foolish Things"") is built. At least director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") packed his disappointingly conventional dramedy with a first-rate cast. Judi Dench Maggie Smith Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson Its like the ""Avengers"" of senior BAFTA winners. All play British retirees with no real purpose left in life. One by one they each decide to leave everything behind and wrap up their final years in India. Newly widowed Evelyn (Dench) and recently divorced Madge (Celia Imrie) believe its high time they had solo adventures. Eternal bachelor Norman (Ronald Pickup) wants a new romance. Graham (Wilkinson) is looking for the lost love of his youth. Douglas (Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton) cant afford to live anywhere else. And Muriel (Smith) is hoping for some low-cost health care. So they all wind up at the titular resort in Rajasthan which is being restored by ambitious young Sonny (Dev Patel). They quickly learn the hotel is not the luxury property he promised but a crumbling mess without even the most basic requirements. Its the sort of situation that will bring out the unexpected best in some and send others packing as quickly as possible. Although the movie is meant to be about challenging ones lifelong assumptions we can predict the characters responses as soon as we meet them. Madden and screenwriter Ol Parker take the easiest most familiar paths (were still doing Viagra jokes?) dropping every opportunity to explore issues like culture clash loneliness and mortality. The nuances are in the performances which are almost uniformly outstanding. Smith and Dench are especially delightful but nearly everyone pushes beyond the sentimentality or stereotypes to find some comic poignancy or heartfelt truth. Its a shame of course that Madden brought the best to such an exoticTop locale without making the most of the opportunity. But even a disappointing trip can be redeemed when youre in the right company.

"Review Best Exotic Marigold Hotel - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Cast makes Best Exotic Marigold Hotel shine ???May 03 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticA comedy-drama saved by the casting bell""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" arranges for a tiptop collection of British character women and men to bring out the best in a pleasantly predictable story. Wait. Shouldnt that be ""unhappily predictable""? Not always folks Some projects are better off going easy on the surprises and concentrating on a reassuring level of actorly craft.When the racist crank completely at odds with India (played by Maggie Smith) comes on muttering about ""brown faces and black hearts reeking of curry"" you know its just a matter of time before she embraces a wider world. And you know Smith is the wily ham for the job.Published in 2004 Deborah Moggachs book (""These Foolish Things"") came from a premise described this way by the author What about the idea of ""setting up retirement homes in developing countries where its sunny and labour is cheap? So I created an Indian whiz kid called Sonny who sets up a retirement home in Bangalore and fills it with Brits.""Director John Maddens film switches the locale to Jaipur. Adapter Ol Parker does more or less what Joss Whedon did with""The Avengers"" make room for the ensemble super heroics albeit on more of a tea-time scale of action.Seduced by a highly misleading brochure seven disparate characters travel from England to India to take a chance on the hotel of the title. Widower Evelyn the narrator figure played by a refreshingly relaxed Judi Dench becomes fast friends with one half of an unhappy couple played by Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton. Tom Wilkinsons abruptly retired High Court judge is on a mission to find the man who got away decades earlier. Ronald Pickup and Celia Imrie are looking for love. Smiths character has come to India for an affordable hip replacement but she finds herself gradually seduced by the chaos both within and surrounding the bedraggled hotel run by Sonny portrayed by Dev Patel previously seen running and dancing for his life in ""Slumdog Millionaire.""The characters are ""types"" some fresher than others. Wiltons stuck with the role of the miserable shrew (""When I want your opinion"" she snaps at Nighy ""Ill give it to you."") but shes humanized in the nick of time. Director Madden encourages honesty and easy-breathing banter. The attitudes evinced by most of the characters and the movie itself are those of the admiring tourist and as two-hour tours go ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" goes smoothly.mjphillipstribune.comThe Best Exotic Marigold Hotel -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sexual content and language)Running time 204Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesStar Trek fans tie the knot at ""Klingon wedding""October 19 2012Duo join romantic comedy Love Punch Timothy Spall Celia...June 19 2012Whats the buzz?November 21 2012Ustinov`s WorldApril 16 1989Find More Stories AboutCharactersRetirement HomeBill NighyMaggie SmithTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0502-best-exotic-marigold-hotel-20120503,0,5707064.column",200,thebestexoticmarigoldhotel24,thebestexoticmarigoldhotel,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel a comedy in which a group of aging Britons decide--or are compelled by financial and health problems--to spend their golden years in India opens by cleverly showing the many ways India has already become a part of everyday life in the U.K. One character gets computer help from a company thats outsourced technical assistance abroad. Others eat curry for dinner with the same regularity their parents would have eaten beef stew. And everyone rubs elbows with those who were either born in India or are only one generation removed from what was once the jewel in the crown of the British Empire. But as each discovers living in a Britain thats become more than a little bit Indian isnt the same as living in India itself. The country breaks it to them gently however. In fact just about everything in the film by Shakespeare In Love director John Madden happens gently. Adapted from the Ol Parker novel These Foolish Things The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel sets its characters on well-trod clearly signposted paths toward late-in-life happy endings. Its familiar in the extreme but manages some sleepytime pleasures in the process thanks largely to an overqualified cast. That includes Judi Dench as a recent widow who left alone after a lifetime of being cared for doesnt quite know what to do with herself. (The film would be better off if she didnt start the blog that gives The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel its overexplaining narration but at least it makes her happy.) Those accompanying her include Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton a couple whose drained retirement savings puts added stress on an already-fraught relationship and Maggie Smith a hard-bitten racist who travels to India only because it offers her best shot at cheap timely hip surgery. Smiths character points to both the films core problems and the elements that largely redeem it. She says vile things and her stern eyes never suggest the actress winking behind the performance. Shes completely unrepentant about her views--until shes not. Forced to live amidst Indians she has a brisk thorough change of heart thats just saved from cliche by deft acting particularly in a monologue in which she finds common ground with a servant whos been waiting on her. Otherwise the best moments belong to Tom Wilkinson who plays a retired government minister traveling back to his childhood home to search for the boyfriend of his youth a relationship that ended in shame for both of them when they were discovered in bed together. Its one of the more compelling plots until it fizzles out in predictable writerly contrivance that shows how little interest the film has in a human connection between the two men. In fact India as a whole--gorgeously photographed as it is--seems on hand mostly to lead its characters toward personal revelations which is awfully generous of the country. Slumdog Millionaire star Dev Patel gives a broadly comic performance as the owner of the titular faded hotel that serves as their home away from home and there are some nods toward the way Indian traditions have been forced to adapt to the 21st century. But mostly The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel stays focused on the cutesy low-stakes personal journeys of its English characters characters it would be hard to care about if they werent brought to life by actors who give the film substance and gravity it doesnt otherwise know how to earn.

In theory seeing Judi Dench Maggie Smith Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy share the screen should be a delight.In reality the seriocomic romp ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" merely has its moments but more often feels heavy-handed sappy and overlong. Sure itll seem warm and crowd-pleasing but probably only to crowds of a certain age who may relate to these characters who find themselves in flux in their twilight. Handsome as the film is from John Madden who directed Dench to her supporting-actress Oscar for ""Shakespeare in Love"" it too often spells out too much and features painfully literal symbolism like a bird taking flight at just the right time.Still Dench does some of the loveliest work of her lengthy and esteemed career here as Evelyn whos recently widowed after 40 years of marriage and struggling to establish an identity on her own. Shes one of several elderly Brits who travel to a resort in Jaipur India that advertises itself as an elegant destination for retirees.Theres also Graham (Wilkinson) a burned-our high court judge with fond memories of India from his youth; Muriel (Smith) a cranky former housekeeper in need of a hip replacement who doesnt even bother to hide her racism; the bickering married couple Douglas (Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton) who are miserable in their new assisted-living community; Madge (Celia Imrie) whod rather be out hunting for a rich husband than taking care of her grandchildren; and Norman (Ronald Pickup) whos similarly been looking for love in all the wrong places.They all end up on the same flight with dreams of a romantic Rudyard Kipling-esque adventure waiting for them. Upon arrival though they find the place is empty and falling apart despite the best efforts of Sonny (Dev Patel of ""Slumdog Millionaire"") the enthusiastic young manager who inherited the hotel from his father to turn it into a palace. Sonny also has his own romantic subplot having fallen in love with a beautiful modern young woman (Tena Desae) whom his snobbish traditional mother doesnt approve of. Patel is very likable here playing an inherently ingratiating character with no obnoxiousness.Eventually all the guests learn to adapt to varying degrees. Each character experiences an obligatory moment of truth in this colorful bustling city but the plot machinations in the script from Ol Parker based on the novel ""These Foolish Things"" by Deborah Moggach feel rather creaky. A lot of the humor is also pretty corny Indian food is so spicy Viagra is so exciting And the Internet is so scary and complicatedHere and there though ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" wins you over temporarily with a subtle delivery or a poignant exchange. Dench and Wilkinson have a couple of quietly powerful moments together and Nighy is just heartbreaking with every sad dry quip he makes.But mostly ""Marigold Hotel"" is old-fashioned safe and resistant to stray from its comfort zone -- like visiting a foreign country and only eating the foods you already know you like.""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" a Fox Searchlight Pictures release is rated PG-13 for sexual content and language.

Except in this case the recycling isnt of souls but of the elements of box office success. So to get the most out of the manufactured Marigold experience -- or at least to find something to say afterward other than ""Well that was...cute"" -- it helps first to meditate on the karmic path that has led to this moment in time and this blending of sanitized Slumdog Millionaire exoticism with the popular Enchanted April promise of reinvention abroad. Likewise to best enjoy this warming tale of seven British pensioners who come to Jaipur for their retirement it helps to watch the actors in a kind of memory trance that summons up past performances overlaid on the present. While admiring Judi Dench now as a stalwart widow in financial straits after her husbands death for instance try summoning up the image of her as the stalwart widow Queen Victoria in Her Majesty Mrs. Brown. While enjoying the delightful apoplexies of Maggie Smith as an acidic old bat afraid of anything foreign think of the many great scenery-chewing variations she has done in recent years since inhabiting the body of Professor Minerva McGonagall throughout the Harry Potter saga. The star may trot out a working womans accent here but its impossible to tune out the chiming imperiousness of her Dowager Countess of Grantham on Downton Abbey. The Dames are joined by Brit vets Bill Nighy (Love Actually) Penelope Wilton (Downton Abbey) Tom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom) Celia Imrie (Calendar Girls) and Ronald Pickup (Fortunes of War) each a character in search of a new lease on life and intrigued by the marketing come-on of the title hotel with its offer of comfy amenities ""for the Elderly and Beautiful."" Of course when they arrive (their dusty white Brit butts bruised by the indignities of Third World travel) the hotel is not exactly as advertised. Phones dont work not every room has its own door that sort of thing. On the flip side the place is run by Slumdog Millionaires young winning Dev Patel here playing an ambitious fellow named Sonny so the energy of the place is good. This optimistic business go-getter loves a pretty girl (Tena Desae) who works in one of those outsourced-labor call centers that have invigorated the Indian economy and exasperated U.S. credit-card customers with questions about their accounts. The affinities between outsourced office laborers and outsourced retirees are pointed out as if by an exhaustively thorough tour guide. To be sure theres something comfortable -- and comforting -- about all this. As directed by John Madden (reunited with Dench after Her Majesty Mrs. Brown and Shakespeare in Love) from a screenplay by Ol Parker (Imagine Me and You) based on a novel by Deborah Moggach the movie is as reliable as a tea bag. And with no more Harry Potters in the pipeline and a lull between seasons of Downton Abbey its a pip to see these players be so...British. The loyal if unhappily married husband (tender-funny Nighy) and his perpetually dissatisfied wife (Wilton) face their marital crossroads; the mournful judge (Wilkinson) attends to a heartache from his past; the fading divorcee(Imrie) and the decaying swinger (Pickup) each address the sexuality of aging singletons. Smith gets to bite into some tasty lines of dialogue (""If I cant pronounce it I wont eat it"") and trundle around in a wheelchair (her character has come to India for an economy-priced hip replacement). Everyone learns. Everyone hugs. The soundtrack favors jaunty sitar melodies. The cinematography shows off the overwhelming sensory stimulation of the place while stepping briskly around less-than-colorful images of real poverty squalor overcrowding and despair. As a brand extender (for the senior cast for the director and certainly for Patel following the grand success of Slumdog) Marigold Hotel achieves what it sets out to do Sell something safe and sweet in a vivid foreign setting to an underserved share of the moviegoing market. The questions were left to ponder are Whats the karmic consequence of putting profit goals ahead of creative energy? What will the next reincarnation of this kind of movie look like? And who will Maggie Smith play? B- Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Another mature performer Maggie Smith fulfills the cantankerous wisecracker role in John Maddens ponderously predictable dramedy As one of a group of seven British retirees spending their declining years at a decrepit Indian hotel Dame Mags hilariously (not to say intentionally) transplants her snooty dowager countess shtick from Downtown Abbey to our politically correct times. You havent lived until youve heard the former Ms. Jean Brodie observe that a black emergency-room doctor can scrub all he likes--that color isnt coming out. The bar has been set for any wheelchair-bound ornery racist roles to follow. Smith isnt the main attraction of course; shes just pushed into frame whenever the movie (sure to delight your seventysomething aunt) needs a vulgar goose. Mostly were stuck watching U.K. cinema bright lights like Judi Dench Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson navigating sub-sitcom scenarios that touch perfunctorily sometimes borderline offensively on issues of sexuality soulmates and culture clash. (Want to get your call-center operators to be productive and sympathetic? Dame Judis on the scene) Madden pads the film with shimmering images of Jaipur and its surroundings; a midmovie funeral sequence--cause somebodys got to kick the bucket--even manages to be somewhat evocative and moving. The rest makes you long for senility to set in but quick.

Reliable middlebrow craftsman John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) makes neat work of Deborah Moggachs novel about a group of disparate British retirees lured--for cut-rate surgery low-overhead living or reasons they hope to keep private--to the Indian subcontinent where they find themselves together under the roof of the titular hotel. The cast is led by Dame Judi Dench as a long-sheltered widow looking to stand on her own two feet. Marigold Hotel has that oh-so-tactful British touch the seeming result of an industry-wide gentlemans agreement never to go too far. The material is ribald but of course never crude and sewn with ""Life begins at 60"" affirmations; the plot twists are about as venerable as the cast and predictably affecting when performed with such old-hand proficiency. Although the film is overextended by a few plotlines too many youll look forward to Tom Wilkinsons turn as a retired high-court judge who still goes fluttery over the memory of an affair from schoolboy days and Bill Nighy as a shy ineffably decent man quietly surprised by how nimble he becomes in this new atmosphere.

By David Denby Jason Segel and Emily Blunt in a movie directed by Nicholas Stoller.   Credit Illustration by Andre Carrilho The director Nicholas Stoller one of the bright young men brought along by the producer-director Judd Apatow (who might as well be running his own studio) began by making the soft Hawaiian-aired romantic comedy ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008). He then moved to rougher terrain in ""Get Him to the Greek"" (2010) with its prickly music-video parodies and Russell Brand flaring his nostrils as its prancing stallion. Now Stoller has directed ""The Five-Year Engagement"" which comes close to offering a complete comic vision of life. Like most romantic comedies the movie sets up marriage as the goalpost but everything becomes an obstacle to the union of Tom Solomon (Jason Segel) and Violet Barnes (Emily Blunt) a thirtyish couple living in San Francisco. At a time when good jobs are scarce theyre a pair pursuing separate careers. But its not just work--or the lack of it--that mucks up their plans; so do family friends the allure of other lovers and the changes and accidents that can befall anyone. ""Engagement"" which Apatow produced and Stoller co-wrote with Segel is a kind of commonplace contemporary American epic--leisurely episodic but pungent densely populated consistently funny and in the Apatovian spirit foulmouthed yet tenderhearted. The couple are a talented Everyman and Everywoman seen with affection and sympathy. Jason Segel is six-four and handsome but with a tendency toward corpulence (jowls threaten to descend). His Tom a sous-chef working in a chic San Francisco restaurant is a friendly eager-to-please man but hes also anxious and irresolute with a strain of anger that bursts out when his back is to the wall. Segel who also starred in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" specializes in non-macho guys willing--a little too willing--to look bad or make fools of themselves. Theres something almost infantile about him. Like a giant roguish baby he seems to enjoy getting naked in front of the camera. In ""Engagement"" however infantilism becomes part of the story. Tom like many Apatovian men needs to pull himself together. As Toms girlfriend Violet who has a Ph.D. in psychology Blunt with her fine dark-blue eyes and plush mouth plays off her natural British incisiveness with occasional bouts of sweet wandering uncertainty. Violet is ambitious but she is decent and loving too so shes often in conflict. As the movie opens the two are driving to a party and Tom casually offers the tidbit that ""frogs can spontaneously switch sexes"" a remark that seems pointless only at first. Violet gets a job at the University of Michigan and Tom agrees to move to Ann Arbor with her but unable to find suitable employment in a restaurant he winds up working in a sandwich shop. Both of them initially make light of the situation. After a while though Tom begins to resent Violets success. He knows its a banal retrograde response but he cant help it. Miserable he tries to adapt to local male customs he grows a furry hunter-trapper beard (it looks like a fox died on his face); he wears hideous sweaters. Without his chefs knives he has no edge. For a while the movie is an uneasily amusing trip to the depths of male negation. Stoller grew up in Miami and Segel in Los Angeles and the sunshine may have prejudiced them against colder climes. Stoller makes the snow and the slush of a Michigan winter look like Siberia in a bad year. Defiantly the couple try rolling in the drifts as the Swedes do for erotic stimulation but Tom lands on a buried fire hydrant. Its that kind of place. Soon Violet is flirting with her flamboyant professor (Rhys Ifans who gives every scene a menacing fizz) and Tom disgusted fakes an orgasm when hes in bed with her (perhaps the most quickly detected male deception imaginable). The movie suggests that relationships work only when you help the other person to act selfishly. If you dont get that aid from your partner and youre forced to give up too much of your own happiness the deal is off. You cant fake it. Comedies about ordinary people have a tendency to fall into drabness relieved by desperation--for instance Tina Fey and Steve Carells recent mishap ""Date Night"" was so tepid that it required repeated shots of Mark Wahlbergs bare torso to keep the audience awake. Stoller and Segel can do routine scenes without squareness. They employ a consistent comic strategy Tom and Violet are three-dimensional characters while the people around them are each defined by a single offbeat trait. Its not so much a satirical view as a perception that most people are naturally obsessive--the hobbyhorse theory of humanity. Stoller and Segel tailored a lot of the small parts for specific actors and Stoller doesnt rush; he gives everyone a good moment and more. Lauren Weedman is irresistible as a top chef so butch and blunt that when she chops off her finger she has someone doggie-bag it and without ceasing to issue commands briskly leaves for the hospital. Brian Posehn plays an Ann Arbor pickle expert with a mountain-man look who speaks the wildest profanities in a monotone. ""Engagement"" adheres to the modern movie convention of extreme candor in which sooner or later characters blurt out whatever hostile thing they are thinking. Violets mother (Jacki Weaver) is a pain-in-the-neck Cassandra who again and again urges immediate marriage on the couple the older generation will die soon she insists. And shes not wrong. Sudden funerals become a tolling blackly humorous refrain. Its a seize-the-day movie even though the day is a long time coming. Like Apatows ""Funny People"" the film is an intentional hybrid half gag comedy half open-ended exploration of everything that can go wrong--and occasionally right--between two people whom nature if not society meant to be together. Many older people grew up loving movies yet they arent going to theatres in proportion to their numbers in the population. One expedient for coaxing the boomers to buy more tickets according to the Times is unbelievably to launch the revival of Bruce Willis Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone chesty gents who will lumber through their remaining years in hard-puffing action films. In Britain they do things differently. Their aging actors may not be as muscular but theyre sturdier less concerned about age--more willing to admit its existence and simply get on with it. In ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" the director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") exhibits a respect for characters in their sixties and seventies which may stem from a respect for the tenacity of the countrys actors. At first the plot seems lame a group of pensioners most of them without sufficient means to live comfortably in England are drawn to India by a Photoshopped brochure and end up in a ramshackle old hotel run by an ebullient young man (Dev Patel) who has no idea what hes doing. The voyagers include a widow (Judi Dench) who is lost without her partner; a much divorced flirt (Celia Imrie); a sourpuss in need of a hip operation (Maggie Smith); a grizzled Don Juan (Ronald Pickup); a distinguished gay former jurist (Tom Wilkinson); and a long-married couple who have settled into fixed roles as aggressor (Penelope Wilton) and exasperated victim (Bill Nighy). Patel from ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is bumptious and voluble and a little bit of his scampering around the hotel is more than enough. Youre relieved when the duffers command the stage. They turn an obvious idea into an emotional adventure guided by superb craftsmanship. Judi Dench is especially good; playing a vulnerable character for a change she allows her habitual toughness to give way to uncertainty fear and moments of gathering resolve and she delivers one of her most wide-ranging and moving performances. ""Marigold"" is I suppose the essence of high-middlebrow filmmaking. There are no violent surprises and little in the way of formal invention. Madden and the screenwriter Ol Parker working from a novel by Deborah Moggach divide the movie into subplots. The characters are not in an easy position--India (as opposed to say Portugal) presents a puzzle and a trial for people set in their ways. The hotel is in Jaipur with its palaces and abundant commerce and a constant tumult on the streets. The light the color the noise the crowds the variety the heat and dust dazzle and overwhelm. Madden and Parker avoid the usual jokes--old ladies undone by saag paneer and the like. The encounters with India are soulful and momentous; the individual stories merge and lead to a reshuffling of partners a sorting out of destinies. As the filmmakers tell it India is a test. Withdrawing from the lure and the demand of the place is tantamount to withdrawing from life. Face it however uncomfortably and you defy mortality.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

TWITTER A first-rate assembly of actors led by Judi Dench Maggie Smith Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson adds class and sly wit to director John Maddens charming Indian odyssey. NEW YORK - Some will doubtless roll their cynical eyes but many of us are suckers for gray-liberation movies in which the English break out of their emotionally constricted shells abroad frequently stumbling upon the lost spirit of their youth in the process. Its hard to go wrong when you assemble actors of the caliber of Judi Dench Maggie Smith Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson and that cast alone should provide Fox Searchlight with a tidy international audience for The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Director John Maddens captivating seriocomedy set against the bustle and color of Jaipur India will be a particular crowdpleaser among the under-served over-60 demographic. Adapted by Ol Parker from Deborah Moggachs novel ""These Foolish Things"" the story has its share of mechanical developments. But even at its most predictable the winning characterizations and soulful insights into aging keep the handsome film on a warmly satisfying track. Slapping their names up on the screen Madden and Parker introduce each of the central characters in an extended pre-titles sequence that plants them all at awkward crossroads. Forced to sell her London flat to pay off her husbands mountain of debt recently widowed Evelyn (Dench) is reluctant to move in with their sons family. High Court Judge Graham (Wilkinson) is retiring after a long and respected career. Mild-mannered Douglas (Nighy) and his joyless snob of a wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) have sunk their retirement funds into their daughters failed Internet startup. Madge (Celia Imrie) is too frisky to stay home playing granny and randy old Norman (Ronald Pickup) can no longer continue lying about his age on dating sites. Muriel (Smith) is a long-serving housekeeper put out to pasture by her employers and now in urgent need of a hip replacement which is prohibitively expensive or requires a long wait in England. Responding to an advertisement for a ""luxury development for residents in their golden years"" they fly to India. Strangers on arrival they all seek some ineffable transformation whether its independence companionship adventure reconciliation with the past or simple dignity. They receive an effusive welcome from Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel) a well-intentioned but disorganized young entrepreneur who inherited the once-grand hotel from his father. But it soon becomes clear that improvements on the dilapidated property have stalled. In addition to a retreating investor Sonny faces obstacles from his overbearing mother (Lillette Dubey). She aims to force him into a more secure business and an arranged marriage frowning on his far-too-modern girlfriend (Tena Desae). While Parkers screenplay is schematic it elegantly traces the ways in which the Marigold guests adapt to their chaotic new surroundings. For some like Evelyn and Douglas the freeing effects are almost instantaneous establishing them as kindred spirits and seeding a gentle flirtation. For Muriel an unapologetic racist who just wants a new hip and a fast ticket home the humanization happens despite her worst instincts when she inadvertently shows kindness to a lower-caste hotel housekeeper. Jean by contrast becomes more entrenched in her resistance to anything new and unknown. The most affecting thread follows Graham the sole member of the group with a previous connection to India having spent his privileged childhood there. A gay man ""more in theory than in practice nowadays"" he has lived with regret and self-recrimination since returning to England to go to college. He left behind the love of his youth to face what he assumes was a life of shame. Observed with sensitivity and played with a deep well of sorrow by Wilkinson this story breathes real tenderness into the movies reflections on growing older and making peace with past mistakes. The heart of the film however is Evelyn whose blog entries heard in voiceover provide a running commentary. Its news to nobody at this point that Dench is a class act and she depicts with the most delicate of brushstrokes the late-in-life reflowering of a woman previously defined through her marriage. Nighy matches Dench with his subtle work. Playing a droll variation on the henpecked husband he shrugs off Jeans barbs until her unrelenting negativity causes Douglas to explode in a terrific confrontation. Wilton is all brittleness and pretentious airs (""Obviously ones read ones Kipling"") but even Jean is allowed a hint of redemptive humanity in Parkers generous screenplay. On the heels of her peerless work in Downton Abbey its refreshing to see quintessential toff Smith play working-class. Her turnabout is perhaps too abrupt to be believed but the actress deftly handles sour Muriels gradual discovery of a new sense of purpose as she assumes a decisive role in the hotels survival. Imrie and Pickup play it a little broader but with brio nonetheless. And in the most substantial of the Indian roles Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) brings an appealing grasp of gangly physical comedy. He pushes the ingratiating over-caffeinated ethnic stereotype in ways that offset the generally more understated work of the senior cast. Cinematographer Ben Davis puts a crisp gloss on the Rajasthan locations his cameras opting for vigorous mobility or serenity as the immediate environment dictates. And Thomas Newmans flavorful score adds to the intoxicating sensory overload. The films pacing may be a touch leisurely for some but its core audience no doubt will relish having time to savor the rewards of a mellow story about endearing characters learning that change is never entirely out of reach.

If The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is anything to go by it seems that along with computer programming and call centres the new Indian economy covers picturesque getaways for middle-aged middle-class middle-of-a-mild-midlife-crisis British folks looking for a change of scenery. Marigold deserves a nod for putting retirement-age characters front and centre but its sentimental platitudes and by-the-numbers storytelling offer little actual enjoyment.The cast constitutes a dream team of veteran thesps Judi Dench is a widow emerging from her shell; Tom Wilkinson is a judge revisiting his youthful home; Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy are navigating a marriage on the rocks; Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup are randy old goats; and Maggie Smith as a hip-op patient offers a working-class variant on her sarky-but-shrewd Downton Abbey shtick. They are all on enjoyable form but none is really challenged.Ol Parkers screenplay is based on Deborah Moggachs novel These Foolish Things. The film doesnt quite sink to the dewy-eyed cliches of Orientalism derided in the book (oh the poverty oh the sunsets) but it still presents a superficial take on contemporary India beaming kids play cricket wise old men proffer advice and standard-issue star-crossed young lovers (Dev Patel and Tena Desae) are saddled with lines like Youre part of a modern India my mother cannot welcomeSuch tin-eared dialogue is pretty typical and the various plot strands trundle along to their predictable termini the occasional unexpected quirk quickly reabsorbed into the flow. With so many characters to juggle several end up getting short shrift and the lessons learned are banal in nature and schematic in execution. They might have just got away with it as a Sunday night mini-series but from a cinematic perspective this trip shouldnt have been embarked upon.

It was highly recommended to me by a friend and I was disappointed during the entire film. It is very superficial and unbalanced it shows for long the supposed British prejudices while does not show enough how Indians are present them as talking English on the streets which is not usual it treats premarital sex and romantic love between young people of different backgrounds in a very light way and highly underestimates the prejudice and rejection Indians have for homosexuality. Kissing is not common on the streets for heterosexual couples. Physical affection is widely exhibited in public like holding hands for example but among heterosexual men who are the ones that occupy the streets. Dev PatelaEUR(tm)s acting was regular. The best part of the film was the acting of the great British actresses Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. No surprise of course. And the insinuation of problem solving collaboration and friendship between people of the East and the West. I do not recommend it. It is plain too romantic thus simplistic. All the problems were happily resolved 25 minutes before the ending so the film rhythm is unrealistic.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 1 2012StuartFeaturedWatched it with my wife on blue ray.

With what they had to start with though something much better could have been done. Very sorry at apparent need to make boy-girl pairs of the people in the story (yes I remember an exception); kind of amazing a story about people in this stage of life that fails the Bechdel test as bonds among women are what interest and sustains so many; and though I love Dev Patel to pieces wished to hear real Indian English from the main Indian character as one knows that native Indian English speaking actors arent too hard to scare up esp. in India.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 16 2012Little old ladies incFeaturedAs little old ladies we strongly resent the implication that we are only interested in crocks of sentimental twaddle. Indeed we are offended by such aspertions and feel that there should be no place in Time Out for such ageist incompoops. Our grandchildren (boys 18 and 15 girls 16 and 14) thoroughly enjoyed Hotel and that is because it is a very good film.

A love song to India a homily on the duty to live life to the full and a tender-hearted examination of love in several forms. A pure delight. Funny unashamed of sentiment well-paced and performed with zest and pleasure by a terrific cast. Dev Patel is preposterously likeable and Judi Dench adds as always a degree of depth that adds humanity without undue earnestness. Maggie Smith - again as always - gives a star turn.

Took my Mum for Mothers Day and she absolutely loved it as did most of the other audience members (who I suspect were all there under similar circumstances to me and my Mum). The acting was good there was humour that worked. Some of the character arcs were a bit unconvincing (Maggie Smith maybe? Though shes so good its forgivable).

Camera work is good but The plot is completely predictable and composed ofone series of cliches after another. It just doesnt pass muster despite the acting of the aged lovvies being generally good. For me the one exception is Bill Nighy who is the same in every film that I have ever seen him appear in - you will all be very familiar with his pouty lips and stammering delivery. Despite all the hype this film leaves one with the same effect as Chinese meal - you are still hungry when you leave the establishment.
