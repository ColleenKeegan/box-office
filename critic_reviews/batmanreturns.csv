Caped Fear - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Caped FearMoody `Batman Returns` Is A Big `small Film`June 19 1992|By Dave Kehr.Given a free hand to create the sequel to ``Batman`` director Tim Burton has come up with a far more personal film than his 1989 original.There are flashes of commercially oriented action and humor but the overall feeling is one of a languid depression sprung straight from the heart of its author.In fact ``Batman Returns`` is so personal that it owes much more to``Edward Scissorhands`` Burton`s 1990 Christmas fantasy about a lonely young man with knifeblades for fingers than it does to the comic book hero created by Bob Kane.Not only is the theme identical-that of the misunderstood man-boy whose knowledge of the dark side of life has made him unlovable he fears to other human beings-but so are the tattered leather costumes the exaggerated expressionistic set design the swelling highly emotional score by Danny Elfman and many of the more self-pitying lines of dialogue.Over it all falls the lovely and inexplicably moving artificial snow of``Edward Scissorhand`s`` fairytale setting.The chief difference is that this time the screenplay by Daniel Waters(``Heathers``) provides three unhappy outsiders instead of ``Edward`s``solo act.There is Michael Keaton`s Bruce Wayne of course still brooding before the gigantic ``Kane``-like fireplace of his hilltop mansion alone but for his faithful butler Alfred (Michael Gough) and his memories of his blueblooded parents killed by a mugger in part one.But now there is The Penguin (Danny DeVito all but unrecognizable under Stan Winston`s waxy makeup) who could be Bruce Wayne as reflected in a distorting carnival mirror. Grotesquely deformed and prone to violent acts against kitty cats from a very early age the poor creature is seen in a flashback being violently rejected by his aristocratic parents-pitched baby carriage and all into the Gotham City sewer system where benign currents lead him into the care of a forgotten colony of penguins in the Arctic World exhibit of an abandoned zoo.And there is Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer in the film`s most passionate and memorable performance) the mousey much-abused executive secretary to Gotham City retail magnate Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) until the night she accidentally uncovers his plan to pump away Gotham`s energy reserves through a phony power plant. Shreck (the name like much of the movie`s imagery comes from the German expressionist cinema in this case F.W. Murnau`s 1922 ``Nosferatu``) calmly shoves her through an upper-story window leaving her crumpled body to be miraculouly revived in the street below by a band of compassionate felines.Reawakened she is also reborn suddenly discovering her feminist anger and sexual power as she whips up a tight-fitting dominatrix outfit on her home sewing machine. Catwoman walks-not just Batman`s evil twin but a projection of his feminine side. (As in ``Edward Scissorhands`` a distinct gay subtext runs through the film particularly in its concentration on secret identities and what the characters call their ``duality.``)Burton seems so smitten by the elaborate game of mirrors he has created that he can do little else but sit back and contemplate it. As narrative``Batman Returns`` barely functions. A half-hearted attempt is made at some election-year topicality with The Penguin backed by Shreck running a prophetic third party candidacy for Mayor of Gotham City (his opponent is played by Michael Murphy the hero of Robert Altman`s TV series ``Tanner`88``).When that peters out the Penguin mounts a biblical plan to assassinate the firstborn sons of Gotham`s leading families which somehow engenders a hallucinatory finale in which an army of penguins (many of them played by elaborate puppets) fans out across the city.More effectively the film charts the shifting relationships among its three moody protagonists relationships that range from infatuation to envy.``Must you be the only lonely man beast in town?`` taunts the Penguin at one point to a Batman who clearly resents being upstaged.Meanwhile Bat and Cat mate by exchanging flesh wounds working out in costumed combat the sexual tension they can`t quite confront when they meet as Bruce and Selina. Again as in ``Edward Scissorhands`` it`s the touch of love that hurts the most.Uniting all of this disparate moody material is the film`s magisterial visual style which seems far more successful and complete than in the somewhat patchy original. Taking his cues from the blend of gothic detail and art deco streamlining in Fritz Lang`s ``Metropolis`` designer Bo Welch has created a wholly enclosed sound-stage environment full of dark corners unexpected turnings and aching existential voids. Moving smoothly between visual epiphanies Burton makes sure there is always something to look at.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesBatman A Hero For Our Time?June 14 1992`Batman Returns` Works The MindJuly 31 1992The Dark Knight RisesJuly 16 2012Sequel Sickness Grounds `Batman`June 26 1992Tedium Takes Toll On `Batman`July 10 1992Find More Stories AboutBatman ReturnsGothamBob KaneTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter,http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-06-19/entertainment/9202240323_1_max-shreck-selina-kyle-batman-returns,200,batmanreturns0,batmanreturns,chicagotribune
"MOVIE REVIEW  The Roar of the Cat Whimper of the Bat - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW  The Roar of the Cat Whimper of the BatJune 19 1992|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC A womans fingers are gnawed until they bleed by a pack of ravenous stray cats. A mans nose is nearly bitten off in a sneak attack by a fish-eating humanoid. Circus clowns open fire on hapless civilians and women are periodically thrown to their death.Welcome to Tims World.Are we having fun yet?""Batman Returns"" the most eagerly awaited and aggressively hyped film of the summer is for better and worse very much the product of director Tim Burtons morose imagination. His dark melancholy vision is undeniably something to see but it is a claustrophobic conception not an expansive one oppressive rather than exhilarating and it strangles almost all the enjoyment out of this movie without half trying. The result is a cheerless brooding but always visually inventive film more or less what you might expect if Ingmar Bergman had directed ""The Addams Family.""The only exception to the overall doom and gloom is Michelle Pfeiffers stylish and funny performance as the frumpy Selina Kyle and her alter ego the whip-cracking gender-bending Catwoman. The energy and pizazz Pfeiffer brings to the dual role is both a hint of the pleasure ""Batman Returns"" (citywide rated PG-13) might have provided and a rebuke to the overall air of glum severity that a sophomoric pseudo-jokey script unsuccessfully attempts to relieve.In a curious way the off-center focus of this film is primarily due to the fact that the box-office success of its predecessor the 1989 ""Batman"" was both enormous (the fastest film ever to hit the 100-million mark; 251 million in receipts all told) and difficult to pin down.Did that ""Batman"" earn all its money because of the late Anton Fursts impressive production design Jack Nicholsons over-the-top antics as the Joker Burtons directorial sensibility an expertly executed ad campaign or merely the films good fortune to appear just when the public in a curious prefiguration of the Ross Perot bandwagon was ready to embrace a wealthy plain-speaking businessman with a cut-to-the-chase approach to solving societys problems?Whatever the reason when Warner Bros. came to making the inevitable sequel the only card available for it to bet on was Burtons. And so in one of those curious obeisances to one mans creative vision that Hollywood falls prey to every now and again a 55-million budget was entrusted no strings attached to the very particular preoccupations of a very curious director.Burton whose affinity for the offbeat was evident not only in the first ""Batman"" but also in ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" is undeniably a major visual talent who glories in the creation of artificial worlds. Expertly aided and abetted by production designer Bo Welch he has come up with a singular look for this film a (what else but) dark fantasy of Gotham City as a dreary urban enclave overwhelmed by neo-totalitarian statuary and riddled with hidden sinister caverns.There is nominally a plot to go along with all these splendid visuals story by Daniel Waters and Sam Hamm screenplay by Waters but Burton preoccupied by all that expensive painstakingly created ambiance doesnt seem much interested in puny narrative and given the lackluster quality of the script it is not hard to see why.As if to make up for the Jokers absence Batman is given not one or two but three adversaries to tussle with and rather than taking the trouble to follow any kind of coherent line ""Batman Returns"" merely switches focus from one to the other to the other until enough time has elapsed for the credits to roll.The most sinister adversary is the Penguin half man half bird tossed out like yesterdays trash by his horrified parents (one of whom is Paul Reubens a.k.a. Pee-wee Herman) and raised to maturity by more understanding creatures. A stringy-haired Danny DeVito has this role looking very much like a demented overweight Tiny Tim and though no trouble has been spared to make this Penguin look as grotesque as possible very little has been done to make his character involving with predictable results.The most human opponent is the odious Max Shreck Gotham Citys leading citizen and a big booster of a polluting power plant no one needs and only Shreck will profit from. With swept-back white hair and a huffy manner Christopher Walken doesnt seem to be in the same movie as anyone else merely a visitor to the set from some other less interesting production.Pfeiffer as Catwoman is as noted also in her own movie but this one is a treat. Clearly relishing both sides of her role the pathetic office assistant and the sleek sexy superheroine she manages to look natural in her leather and latex dominatrix outfit and whatever funny lines the script has belong mostly to her. ""Its the batman"" she says dumbfounded on meeting the great man for the first time.

Batman Returns may be the surest box office bet of the year but when you get past the saturation merchandising to the movie itself its hard not to notice theres no Joker in the deck this time. It occasionally happens that the true measure of a great actors contribution to an original film can be felt only when he is necessarily absent from the sequel. Jack Nicholson the exuberant satanic soul of Batman made his flamboyant exit as the Joker who really was wild leaving director Tim Burton with a gaping hole that he has not been able to fill. The clash of Batman and the Joker allowed Michael Keaton and Nicholson to give us a richly sardonic and glumly knowing consideration of good and evil. In Gothams cesspool of corruption the line between the two was blurred and shifting. In Batman Returns  the villainy is divided among three opponents for Batman - Danny DeVitos Penguin Michelle Pfeiffers Catwoman and Christopher Walkens megamillionaire Max Schreck. Three turns out to be a crowd and perhaps sensing the problem Burton and screenwriter Daniel Waters opted to concentrate on the Penguin. This means Walken disappears from the film for long stretches and Pfeiffers fetching feline slinkily and sometimes kinkily sexy and cattily witty (""Lifes a bitch so am I"") is unconscionably slighted. Her scenes with Keaton who renders the Caped Crusader with the same effective and subdued reticence boast the films best dialogue - and a charged ambivalence and subtlety missing from the rest of Batman Returns . Their literally tangled relationship and the ironic parallels in their lives lift the story and the characters to the stunning level of the films production design and darkly opulent vision. Here surely was the double opportunity to allow Keaton to expand and deepen the hero while giving Pfeiffer the room she deserved. But as Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands reminded us Burton always has been more absorbed by what his audience sees than by what his movies say. Its part of his unique talent as a filmmaker but it leads him to ignore the flaws in the structure of what is after all supposed to be an exciting adventure film. Important plot points simply disappear. One that didnt have any point in the first place involves Schrecks diabolic scheme to build a giant facility that would consolidate all Gothams electric power in his hands. It is raised and then abandoned. Next DeVito is coming up with a particularly fowl play and running as a sort of H. Ross Penguin independent candidate for mayor of Gotham. With the observation ""Weve elected people much worse than the Penguin"" as his campaign rationale this highly topical theme of voter gullibility arrayed against a backdrop of growing urban chaos has real possibilities - which once again go unrealized. Instead the action veers to the Penguins most vengeful deed in which he plans the kidnapping and drowning of the firstborn sons of Gothams richest families. Mass infanticide is an idea you understandably dont come across very often and its the first time I have encountered it in a Hollywood movie that millions of children will want to see. Parents should also be warned there are some other jarring and scary moments that might upset younger children. Since the Penguin has his flipper on the controls of these increasingly erratic plot swings the burden of Batman Returns falls to DeVito. With his twin-beaks makeup and bowling-ball body in vaguely Victorian attire the Penguin looks like a taskmaster stalking a Charles Dickens workhouse. Where Nicholson and his elevator eyebrows did the Joker as the cheerful culmination of all the devilment in his other movies and as a villain who rejoiced in his evil DeVito tries for something different. Abandoned as a hideously deformed baby by his parents (pay attention thats a barely recognizable Pee-wee Herman as the father) the Penguin grows up underground. His empire is the sewers beneath Gotham and his subjects are a bizarre mix of loyal penguins and circus performers. On its own terms DeVitos is an entertaining reading but he is surely made to be more of a sidekick in this kind of movie. And given his plans for Gothams children his attempt to go for pathos in the Penguin was a mistake. The directors lack of support also forces DeVito into some repetitive ranting. Burton is more interested in cramming Batman Returns with odd visual twists (who else would think of penguins as missile launchers?) and puns and references to other movies. There are citations of everything from German expressionist masterworks of the silent era to Citizen Kane and above all Cecil B. De Milles The Ten Commandments. Most of the commandments are of course broken by Batmans enemies in the course of Batman Returns . So too were some pretty elementary rules of story- telling by Burton and screenwriter Waters.

Absent from the silver screen since before last years Sarasota debacle his face is the first youll see in the 55 million sequel to 1989s bat-blockbuster.Its a somewhat different face actually adult and mustachioed monocle perched on one cheek thin lips effetely gripping a cigarette holder. This man seems curiously unmoved as screams from the next room announce the birth of his child.When the baby turns out to be born with a beakish nose and flipperlike hands his father and mother chuck him off a bridge after which hes discovered by penguins and adopted by a circus. Bitter and grotesque he eventually becomes the egg-shaped Penguin latest nemesis of Gotham Citys famous Caped Crusader.Returning to bat in Batman Returns is Tim Burton who directed the 1989 Batman as well as such hits as Edward Scissorhands Beetlejuice and yes Pee-wees Big Adventure. For his new film Burton digs deep into comic-book lore coming up with not only the Penguin (Danny DeVito) but also with the sharp-clawed Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) whom the filmmaker cleverly reinvents. In Burtons version shes a meek secretary who turns flashy super-villain after being pushed out a window by her boss the power-crazed - and power-plant-crazed - mega-businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken).To save the tortured soul of Gotham Batman must defeat all three - Shreck Penguin and Catwoman (to whom he is of course strongly drawn). With a caveful of new gadgets (computerized bat-erangs gliding wings bat-boat etc.) and aided by his trusty butler (Michael Gough) the Dark Knight is ready for anything.Returning as Batman in Batman Returns is Michael Keaton who once again gives the shadowy hero the deep shadings that warded off the campy ghost of 1960s TV Batman Adam West and captured the paranoid atmosphere of the late 1980s. Facing down the evildoers who would destroy Batman Keaton looks out from his stylish cowl with grim haunted eyes.Like the hero himself the movie is larger than life - a horrific fantasy that gets carried away with itself as the mood builds and the tension mounts. Setting the story at Christmastime Burton uses the seasons chilly cheerfulness ironically as he did in Edward Scissorhands establishing a counterpoint to the movies macabre mood. (Penguin keeps a thermos of toxic waste in a Santa stocking.)For Bat-maniacs the big question is Is Batman Returns as great as Batman? The first film was slammed by many blinder-than-bats critics (who probably will fall all over themselves proclaiming how much they prefer the new one) but the first Batman was one of my favorites of 1989. Its narrative needed polishing but the emotional intensity of the piece its tech-noir look nightmarish music (the Danny Elfman stuff not the Prince stuff) and operatic performances carried the day with me.Batman Returns has wonderful scary music (by Elfman; no Prince this time) and a wonderful scary look - courtesy of cinematographer Stefan Czapsky (Vampires Kiss Edward Scissorhands) and production designer Bo Welch (carrying on in the style of the late Anton Furst who designed the first Batman). The performances are generally good not just Keatons but also that of Michelle Pfeiffer who is shockingly feline in her skin-tight black-leather suit (with whip accessory) and who manages to find a measure of plausibility in the bizarre Catwoman.Danny DeVitos performance as the pale-faced Penguin is also effective as far as it goes although for all its Elephant Man-esque pathos it doesnt match the lunatic power of Jack Nicholsons pale-faced Joker turn in Batman. Paul Reubens is terrifically eerie in his brief silent role and Christopher Walken with spats and swept-back hair creates an ultra-rich sleaze whos like your worst nightmare of Donald Trump and Ross Perot rolled into one. (His characters name is borrowed from the actor who starred as Dracula in the 1922 Nosferatu.)Where Batman Returns doesnt measure up to Batman is on the level of plot. Yes the first Batman also had story problems but Burton maintained its emotional intensity from start to finish carrying you over the rough spots.The new script (by Heathers writer Daniel Waters from a story credited to him and Sam Hamm) is both too complex and not always well thought-out. Batman Returns is still largely entertaining but where the earlier movie seemed like Burtons attempt to build on the disturbing implications of the Batman legend the new film is more often a case of his trying to get away with being as weird as possible. Near the end - as Penguin begins to take his crazed revenge - the movie swells out of control Its darker and weirder than its predecessor but not as gripping.1 | 2 | Next MORELottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoDo your homework before painting or sealing cool deckPuerto Rico birth certificates How to get a new oneLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida Lotto Related ArticlesDark Knight Returns In Fine FormOctober 23 1992Catwoman Purrs In Batman SequelApril 24 1994Batman Takes His 2nd Swing At EvilMay 30 1993Its Deja Vu Vu Vu When These Game Sequels Hit The StoresFebruary 26 1993Batman amp; Robin Flies To Top Spot During WeekendJune 23 1997Find More Stories AboutBatman ReturnsCatwomanIndex by Keyword|Index by Date|Privacy Policy|Terms of ServicePlease note the green-lined linked article text has been applied commercially without any involvement from our newsroom editors reporters or any other editorial staff.,http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1992-06-19/entertainment/9206190081_1_1989-batman-first-batman-batman-returns,200,batmanreturns5,batmanreturns,orlandosentinel
Offbeat `Batman Returns` Is A Freudian Fairy Tale - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Offbeat `Batman Returns` Is A Freudian Fairy TaleJune 19 1992|By Gene Siskel.``Our Flick of the Week is ``Batman Returns`` in which the Dark Knight battles the Penguin and Catwoman while director Tim Burton tries to make a personal film about characters with troubled private lives. The Penguin (Danny DeVito) was abandoned as an ugly infant; the Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) is verbally abused at work and Batman (Michael Keaton) is still working out the childhood trauma of seeing his parents gunned down.This time the richness of the Batman movie is not in its production design-indeed designer Bo Welch is a toy shop window decorator compared with the late great Anton Furst-but rather in Burton`s and screenwriter Daniel Waters` Freudian view of adult human behavior. If all this makes ``Batman Returns`` seem overly serious well that`s an overstatement. But it should be a pleasure for non-adolescents to encounter a comic-book action picture in which the characters are more important than their gadgets.In other words I liked ``Batman Returns`` because I found myself thinking more about Bruce Wayne than the Batmobile more about the Penguin`s childhood than his aerodynamic umbrella.This emphasis on character has its downside. The Penguin is more sympathetic than frightening. Catwoman`s activism is undercut as a threat to Batman and to Gotham City by Pfeiffer`s sweet comic scenes. The result is that our rooting interest is not for any macho act by Batman to save the city but for each character to achive some sort of emotional peace. That makes for a strange but refreshing action story.``Batman Returns`` is playing at the the Burnham Plaza McClurg Court Webster Place and outlying theaters. Rated PG-13.

This darker weirder sequel is easy to find fault with--seamless storytelling has never been Tim Burtons thing. But I wouldnt trade 10 minutes of it for ""Lethal Weapon 3...... Alien 3"" and ""Far and Away"" put together. Burton couldnt play it safe if he wanted to and he doesnt want to. Entrusted with one of the most valuable franchises in movie history (the merchandising of "" Batman"" brought in more than 500 million) hes made a moody grotesque perversely funny 50 million art film. But like every other Burton oddity from "" Pee-wees Big Adventure"" to ""Beetlejuice"" to ""Edward Scissorhands"" it will probably be a big hit. Something about the filmmakers eccentric surreal childlike images seems to strike a deep chord in the mass psyche he makes nightmares that taste like candy.Gotham City is certainly a nightmare town New York reimagined (by the marvelous production designer Bo Welch) as a half-Gothic half-Bauhaus three-ring circus of corruption. The ineffectual mayor (Michael Murphy) is a mere figurehead; the real power is in the hands of the avaricious businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) who wants to build a power plant that will suck all the energy out of the city. (This white-haired mogul may be an inside dig at Time Warner boss Steve Ross.) Even more threatening is the half-human crime lord Penguin (Danny DeVito) ruler of a marauding gang of clowns acrobats and sword swallowers who are terrorizing the city. The Penguin a bulbous Humpty Dumpty of a figure with flipper hands and a beaklike nose emerges from his lifelong lair in the sewers pretending to search for his parents and is persuaded to run for mayor. (""Our voters like fingers"" advises his image consultant offering to disguise his flippers. Unhousebroken the candidate chomps down on the nose of his handler.) Only Batman/Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) sees through the Penguins ruse of respectability and vows to stop him. But another not-entirely-human figure stands in Batmans way-Michelle Pfeiffers sinuously sexy Catwoman.This is more or less the plot but Burton and screenwriter Daniel ("" Heathers"") Waters couldnt be less concerned with moving the narrative in a straight line. Maxs power plant gets forgotten about halfway through and the Penguins threat to turn the town against the Caped Crusader never amounts to much. There are enough car crashes shoot-outs and explosions to keep the kids happy but what really seems to inspire Burton even more than DeVitos flamboyant villainy and a huge supporting cast of real and artificial penguins is the slinkily ambiguous Catwoman Batmans foe flame and alter ego. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Burtons theme in ""Batman Returns"" is the masks people wear to hide their divided hearts. Hes never seen Batman as a conventional heroic figure which is why Keaton with his clamped-down instability is so right for the part. Now Burtons given this borderline schizoid an equally unsettled love interest Catwoman also has a double life. Formerly Max Shrecks gawky lonely secretary Selina Kyle shes hurled out a window by her boss when he discovers shes on to his nefarious scheme and emerges from near death as the whip-cracking man-hating avenger Catwoman. Waterss script never makes the rules of Selinas back-and-forth switches into Catwoman clear but what twisted dirty fun Pfeiffer has with this role As Selina falls in love with Bruce Wayne and Catwoman battles Batman Burton invests his troubling love story with a surprising emotional punch. Theyre doomed lovers for the age of alienation turned on by each others kinkiness.DeVito cant erase fond memories of Jack Nicholsons Joker but hes indelible in his own right with his feral beak and guttural New York bleat hes like Jimmy Durante reborn as a fat rabid predator. Walken doesnt need a mask to wear one oozing inscrutable malevolence hes internalized his villainy so adeptly even he doesnt seem to know what he may do next. "" Batman Returns"" shares that volatile unpredictability you never know where this brooding satirical prodigiously imaginative movie may turn. Sure sometimes the story dead-ends down a dark alley. But just around the corner lurks a visual marvel. This demented toyshop of a movie is a bit of a mess but its a visionary mess. Of how many sequels can that be said?PHOTO A three-ring circus (From left) Keatons Batman DeVitos Penguin Pfeiffers CatwomanDAVID ANSENThe week before ""Batman Returns"" opens to daunting expectations Tim Burton seems frazzled but in a cheerfully morose sort of way. Coming off a year of high-pressure work is like ""coming off a drug."" But this particular try wasnt easy with the success of ""Batman"" hanging over the set. "" I was trying to talk them out of me doing it"" he recalls of Warner Bros. pressure on him to make the sequel. ""I tried to warn them. Im just going to have to treat it as another movie."" Burton 32 wasnt satisfied with ""Batman""--and his own narrative skill. "" I was trying to tell a real story but I cant do it."" He was determined on ""Batman Returns"" to focus instead on the characters and certain themes relationships politics masks sexuality split personalities. ""I love these grand unintegrated tragic weird characters . . . I feel very two-sided myself. Everybody I know has a split.""For him the phenomenal success of the original was more a cultural fluke than a testament to his moviemaking. ""I dont know what makes movies work. Its not an exact science."" What bugs Burton that studio execs like to pre tend it is and all those ""experts and authorities"" on the set trying to tell him what ingredients would make another blockbuster made him crazy. ""Stop torturing me"" he remembers thinking. ""Its only making me tired; its only getting my anger focused on you people-not on what I need to do.""At heart Burton still thinks of himself as an amateur. ""I feel like I lucked into filmmaking. I never studied for it. My movies just sort of ended up being representative of the way I am. . . Thats the danger of me making bigbudget movies. I just get interested in things that I relate to that dont necessarily have anything to do with anybody else."" But Burton is mistaken. His peculiar vision of reality is contagious hes never had a commercial flop. He may make the suits nervous but theyre happy to count their profits. Burton and Hollywood are bound to drive each other crazy for a long time.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

B- Batman Returns Genre Action/Adventure Sci-fi and Fantasy; Starring Danny DeVito Michael Keaton Michelle Pfeiffer Christopher Walken Jan Hooks Michael Murphy; Director Tim Burton; Runtime (in minutes) 126; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted June 26 1992 -- 1200 AM EDT You dont have to look very hard at Tim Burtons films (Beetlejuice Edward Scissorhands) to see that this director spends much of his time dreaming about warped lonely charismatic weirdos who suddenly find themselves empowered. His most radically transformed misfit? A reclusive rather bland millionaire named Bruce Wayne who under cover of the night (not to mention a rubber bat suit complete with fake washboard stomach) became the saturnine vigilante hero of 1989s Batman. In the exhaustingly inventive Batman Returns Batman the tormented crime fighter (Michael Keaton) is back -- by day hes still a fairly colorless preppie -- only now hes joined by a veritable parade of Burtonesque nerds bent on revenge. For openers theres the Penguin (Danny DeVito) a blobby hook-nosed runt who has waddled out of the sewer to become Gotham Citys latest criminal pest. Hands deformed into flippers his scowling white death-face offset by rotten teeth and a scraggly Dickensian mop hes a villain to make you hurl -- Humpty Dumpty reborn as a decaying Victorian ghoul. Yet he just wants to be loved Abandoned as a baby by his aristo-trash parents the Penguin now mounts a doomed campaign to regain his place as a high-born citizen of Gotham City. Then in a Jekyll-and-Hyde routine to rival Batmans there is Catwoman who starts off as timid repressed executive assistant Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer). Left for dead by her crooked corporate boss (Christopher Walken) who pushed her out a window for leafing through incriminating documents she gets up in a daze and in a scene destined to warm the hearts of Catholic school girls everywhere proceeds to toss away all her inhibitions. Gleefully trashing the ""nice"" knickknacks in her apartment she transforms herself into the baddest bad girl on the block -- a whip-wielding tease clad in a home-stitched suit of black dominatrix vinyl. Burton its obvious empathizes with every one of his rebellious freaks. As a storyteller though he hasnt begun to figure out what these characters are doing in the same film. Batman Returns offers many jolts of pleasure yet its also a mess -- a gilded sketchbook of a movie that keeps falling open to random pages. Narrative has never been Burtons strong point but even when his films werent seamless they felt like coherent pop visions. This may be the first one that doesnt hold together. Batman Returns has too many competing characters too many sets (every scene seems to unfold on a different surreal soundstage) too many ""ideas"" that dont go anywhere. The movie is a genuine spectacle laced with Burtons pitch-black wit yet in its eager-to-please mood it often recalls the jam-packed blockbuster overkill of Steven Spielbergs Hook. The first Batman was something of a mess too yet the film was anchored by Jack Nicholsons brilliant performance which only seemed out of control -- it was really a grandiose parody of anarchic villainy. Danny DeVitos Penguin is a funny explosive little dweeb but he doesnt have the same resonance. DeVito issues pleas for love in an impassioned rasp leers with delight as he fires bullets out the end of his umbrella and even devours a raw fish. He gets off some scurrilous one-liners too (especially when ogling potential groupies). Yet the Penguin isnt really smart and his master plan never makes a lot of sense. He runs for mayor and then after an hour returns to the sewer at which point he has to start over (and so does the movie). Its hard to take much demonic satisfaction in the Penguins craziness. Mostly were just watching Danny DeVito chew the scenery -- which admittedly hes quite good at. The runaway star here is Pfeiffer whose performance is a sexy comic triumph. Neither crime fighter nor villain but something in between her Catwoman is a post-Madonna feminist She finds emotional liberation in acting salacious. Pfeiffer has perfected a slinky-predatory walk and she speaks in the honeyed tones of a phone-sex vixen but with an undertow of dark knowledge as if she had secrets that scared her. What makes the performance a sly turn-on is that Pfeiffer isnt just playing trashy. Shes playing a nice girl acting trashy (and so the act has to be that much more extreme). Bruce and Selina have the hots for each other -- or is it Batman and Catwoman? The notion of two people who have to put on rubber animal suits to deal with their hormones has satirical (and kinky) possibilities yet like so much else in this movie it just sort of floats by. The romance might have worked better had Burton at least attempted to rectify the central flaw in Batman -- namely that Keatons Bruce Wayne was just a polite stiff. Well hes still a stiff. It may be that Burton finally has no interest in anything ""normal."" He should realize though that normality isnt the enemy of fantasy Its the jumping-off point. This is one Batman that for all its scattershot invention never quite takes wing.

Comments Batman Returns More of the same but nowhere near as good (funny disturbing obsessive) as the uneven original revealing arrested development on every level. As villain Danny DeVitos Penguin is a pale substitute for Jack Nicholsons Joker coming across more as a sketch for a character than a fully realized portrait; ditto for Michelle Pfeiffers Catwoman who promises a lot more than she delivers. Both characters are Jekyll-and-Hyde schizos like Batman/Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton again) but it appears the filmmakers were so busy plotting the obligatory special effects that they never got around to developing these three leads past the drawing-board stage. The pictorial effects all seem to come straight out of badly reproduced stills from other movies (Batman Metropolis Citizen Kane Blade Runner) and theres practically no suspense. Tim Burton directs with a strong sense of ""once more around the block"" from a script by Daniel Waters and Sam Hamm that plays suspiciously like a first draft and Danny Elfman did the music again. Consider though this could have been much worse than it is and still have made piles of money so why make it even halfway decent?

Follow-up to the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time has the same dark allure that drew audiences in three years ago. But many non-fans of the initial outing will find this sequel superior in several respects meaning that Tim Burtons latest exercise in fabulist dementia should receive even stronger across-the-board acceptance than the original. Warner Bros. reported  80-million-plus investment will be an afterthought in the wake of the B.O. cascade which should approach the  250 million neighborhood of the first pic domestically. Initial ""Batman"" was remarkably heavy and unlikable for such a commercial sensation. Freshly minted item most noticeably lacks Jack Nicholsons manic Joker some key artistic personnel are different and film is too long for its own good but Burton and his cohorts have perpetuated the originals extraordinary look and embellished it with a host of new ideas. Batmans new adversaries- Penguin and Catwoman-are both fascinating creations wonderfully played. And much of the film particularly the first half  is massively inventive and spiked with fresh perverse humor. Burton has once again managed to pursue his quirky personal concerns in the context of broadly commercial entertainment although the idiosyncracies of the villains clearly interest him far more than the programmable heroics of the title character and the related mandatory action sequences. Like its predecessor ""Batman Returns"" is one big glob storywise without a strong dramatic arc and propelled by weak narrative muscles. Fortunately however the screenplay by Daniel Waters-whose work on ""Heathers"" was as memorable as his contribution to ""Hudson Hawk"" was misjudged-offers up a succession of scenes that ranges from the mildly intriguing to the genuinely inspired. His dialogue has an irreverent weirdness that often provokes mental double takes and unexpected laughs. Interest gets cranked up high immediately by a prologue that illustrates the creation of the Penguin. Playing the infants parents Diane Salinger and a virtually unrecognizable Paul (Pee-wee Herman) Reubens dump the cradled tot into a freezing stream in Central Park. Like Moses he survives although the flock he gathers under the streets of Gotham City is of an entirely different sort comprising crazed circus rejects and actual penguins. Disrupting a civic Christmas celebration in a striking architecturally fascistic reimagining of Rockefeller Center Plaza Penguin (Danny DeVito) announces that he wants some respect and now that he has come up from a lifetime underground aims to find out who his parents were and why they abandoned him. Calling himself ""a child who was born a little different"" and displaying the shiny flippers he hasfor hands this Penguin is a kissin cousin to Edward Scissorhands although a diabolically evil one bright enough to observe ""Its human nature to fear the unusual."" Forming an alliance with business tycoon Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) a specialist in industrial waste and leeching off the city Penguin decides to run for mayor- an interesting coincidental twist in this year of the independent candidate-while simultaneously hastening the communitys ruin with his maniacal terrorist attacks. Equally intriguing character of Catwoman evolves out of the demeaning treatment dished out by Shreck to his lovely somewhat disheveled secretary Selina Kyle. Rather comically continuing her ""Frankie and Johnny"" routine as a forlorn single woman who barely gets by in a shabby big-city apartment Michelle Pfeiffer plays a woman who gets thanked for finally standing up to her boss by getting pushed out a window. Showing her feline propensities however she rallies from certain death and becomes a kitten with a whip who can very much hold her own with Batman. Oh yes-Batman has to fit in here somewhere. Unfortunately for the twisted imaginations of Burton and Waters the winged one must remain a relatively straight upstanding character and therefore of limited interest to them. Batman comes to the perfunctory rescue of numerous anonymous individuals through the course of things but actually spends much of his time being humbled and humiliated by his highly imaginative opponents. One of the pics main drawbacks as with the first is that Bruce Wayne/Batman remains a relative cipher a symbol of the force of good rather than a psychologically dimensional character on a par with the evildoers. It is an unmistakable Burton touch to emphasize the extreme isolation in which all three of his major characters live and the bird/cat opposition is played up nicely. But the real accomplishment of the film lies in the amazing physical realization of an imaginative universe. Where Burtons ideas end and those of his collaborators begin is impossible to know but result is a seamless  utterly consistent universe full of nasty notions about societal deterioration  greed and other base impulses. Lensed seemingly entirely indoors or on covered sets pic is a magnificently atmospheric elaboration on German expressionism. Its look has been freshly imagined by production designer Bo Welch based on the Oscar-winning concepts of the late Anton Furst in the first installment. Welchs Gotham City looms ominously over all individuals and every set-from Penguins aquariumlike lair and Shrecks lavish offices to Bruce Waynes vaguely ""Citizen Kane""-like mansion and simple back alleys-is brilliantly executed to maximum evocative effect. Similarly costumes by Bob Ringwood carrying on from the initial outing and Mary Vogt evince imagination pushed to an advanced level. Batmans outfit has been appealingly altered to a sharper more armored look. Catwoman has always been a knockout but her form-fitting black leather look has been given an extra dimension by the homemade stitching that gradually comes apart. And Penguins amorphous shape is often clothed in oddly Victorian garb that outstandingly emphasizes his otherness. All the way down the line behind-the-scenesters can take deep bows notably including lenser Stefan Czapsky (taking over on camera from Roger Pratt) Penguin makeup and effects producer Stan Winston key makeup artist Ve Neill visual effects supervisor Michael Fink special effects supervisor Chuck Gaspar composer Danny Elfman and the almost endless lineup of craftspeople artisans and technicians. In few films does the synthesis of so many peoples different contributions into a single aesthetic count for so much. On the performance side the deck is stacked entirely in favor of the villains. Briskly waddling cawing his rude remarks and conveying decades worth of resentment and bitterness DeVito makes Penguin very much his own in a unique and far-from-endearing performance thats always fascinating to watch. Although some doubted that she was the ideal choice after she had replaced the pregnant Annette Bening in the role Pfeiffer proves to be a very tasty Catwoman indeed. Endearingly klutzy initially as Selina she looks amazing in her skin-tight Samp;M-like leather skin wins the viewer over to her new incarnation with her intimidating display of whip mastery in a department store then dazzles as she cartwheels through Gotham City on her enigmatic mission vis-a-vis the grand power struggle. Wild-maned Walken has the right comic understatement and sangfroid as Max Shreck a character named as an in-joke after the German actor who starred as the screens first Dracula in F.W. Murnaus 1922 ""Nosferatu."" As in the first film Michael Keaton is encased in a role as constricting as his superhero costume and while the actors instincts seem right the range he is allowed is distinctly limited. Given the psychological dimension provided to the other lead characters the vacuum at the center stands as the most prominent shortcoming of the ""Batman"" features to date. Its also clear that Burton is not at heart an action director and the big scenes of mass mayhem gigantic explosions and crowd movement are those in which the film becomes flat and uninvolving. At 126 minutes pic runs exactly as long as the original but trimming by 10 or 15 minutes mainly from the final section  would have vastly enhanced its pace and impact.

It says less about the first films dark ingenuity than about its sour cynical spirit and its taste for smirking sadism qualities that dimmed the urgency for a return visit to Gotham City and its trouble-plagued citizenry. Yet the status of ""Batman"" as one of Hollywoods biggest commercial triumphs only compounded the sequel problem creating pressure to re-activate this money machine at any cost. The prospect of a new ""Batman"" installment -- ""Batman Returns"" opens today at more than 2600 theaters nationwide -- has thus been more inevitable than welcome. Under these circumstances the director Tim Burton has wisely switched gears re-inventing the mood and manner of ""Batman"" so fearlessly that he steps out of his own films murky shadow. Mr. Burtons new ""Batman Returns"" is as sprightly as its predecessor was sluggish and it succeeds in banishing much of the dourness and tedium that made the first film such an ordeal. Indeed allowing for a ceiling on viewers interest as to just what can transpire between cartoon characters like Batman and the Penguin ""Batman Returns"" is often an unexpectedly droll creation. It stands as evidence that movie properties like this storys enchantingly mixed-up Catwoman really can have multiple lives. Drawing upon the fairy-tale spirit of his more freewheeling fables -- ""Edward Scissorhands"" ""Beetlejuice"" ""Pee-wees Big Adventure"" -- Mr. Burton creates a wicked world of misfits all of them rendered with the mixture of horror sympathy and playfulness that has become this directors hallmark. More so than Jack Nicholsons mockingly vicious Joker in the earlier film this storys miscreants have colorful clinical histories. So intensely does Mr. Burton render his villains tender psyches in fact that the upright hero Bruce Wayne a.k.a. Batman (Michael Keaton) is easily overlooked amid all the toys and troublemakers that surround him. This Batman with motives and magical powers that are never made interesting is at best a cipher and at worst a black hole. The blandness of Batman (through no fault of Mr. Keaton who plays the character with appropriate earnestness) is symptomatic of this materials main shortcoming almost nothing about it makes sense or particularly matters. Primarily a visual artist Mr. Burton is often casual about plot considerations which means that audiences watching his films are set adrift as if in dreams. And the characters thoughts and motives are half-forgotten before the film is over. Costumes attitudes gadgets and the great ingenuity of Bo Welchs dazzling production design will linger in the mind long after the actual story of ""Batman Returns"" becomes a blur. Because the films predominant motif is that of wounded individuals re-inventing themselves as wily villains its most memorable episodes are early ones explaining each main characters transformation. Beginning wittily with the troubled infancy of the Penguin -- as parents Diane Salinger and a monocled Paul Reubens are seen throwing their offspring into a sewer where he floats away to grow up among the birds -- the film moves on to the beleaguered secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her own peculiar evolution. Mousy and lonely -- Selina habitually calls out ""Honey Im home"" then reminds herself that she isnt married -- this secretary is treated contemptuously by Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) a wealthy industrialist with the arrogance to throw uncooperative employees out windows. ""How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?"" Selina wails. But Max hurts her anyway and only the efforts of a team of alley cats bring her back to life. Saved like the Penguin by the magic of the animal world Selina metamorphoses thrillingly into Catwoman in a sequence that ranks with the most captivating moments Ms. Pfeiffer has spent on screen. Fully inhabiting this vixenish character she turns Catwoman into a fierce seductive embodiment of her earlier dissatisfaction. ""Lifes a bitch"" she slyly declares. ""Now so am I."" Systematically destroying her past Selina smashes the bric-a-brac demolishes the dollhouse and spray-paints the cute clothes emerging from the ruins of her earlier life as a wonderfully sultry and diffident creature in a skin-tight gleaming black wetsuit. There will be viewers drawn to ""Batman Returns"" largely for the chance of watching Ms. Pfeiffer strike this pose and they wont be sorry. But there is at least as much personality to the performance as there is visual appeal as evidenced by the bored feline drawl with which she delivers her best lines. ""Oh please"" she yawns later when propositioned by the eager Humpty Dumpty-shaped Penguin (Danny DeVito). ""I wouldnt touch you to scratch you."" ""Batman Returns"" is at its best in this introductory stage and in the halting courtship that develops between Batman and Catwoman when they arent matching wits in black battle regalia. It is weakest in a long drawn-out finale that only emphasizes Mr. Burtons relative lack of interest in ordinary action sequences. This ending will make audiences wish it were not a Hollywood truism that films as expensive and ambitious as ""Batman Returns"" need be more than two hours long. 1 2 Next Page gt; More Theaters Near You >> Inside NYTimes.com Health >> Too Hot to Handle Arts >> The Harmony of Liberty Opinion >> Should Beach Privatization Be Allowed?

An architectural and anthropomorphic psychodrama the sequel is a bulky amalgam of Stupid Pet Tricks Visigothic Disney World and ""I Never Promised You a Rose Garden."" Like its lethargic forebear it suffers from director Tim Burtons basic indifference to what becomes of his characters after hes drawn them.Working from a screenplay by the equally dire Daniel Waters who wrote ""Heathers"" and ""Hudson Hawk"" Burton aims for a lighter brighter sexier sequel. But the mood is so suffocatingly somber it might have been shot in the belly of an architect -- probably the one who built the movies fabulously fascistic Gotham Plaza. A grand parody of Rockefeller Square it represents the citys hegemony over its citizens who have gathered for the annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony when the action begins A cadre of the Penguins macabre harlequins attacks and Bruce ""Batman"" Wayne (Michael Keaton) is summoned by Batsign.This installment of the Batman epic concerns the ""difficulty with duality"" as the hero puts it to the scratchy licky Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer) his sinuous new love-hate interest. The secretary of evil polluter Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) by day Selina ""Catwoman"" Kyle takes on a dual personality when she is raised from the dead by cats. The Penguin (Danny DeVito) hopes to ally with her in his battle for dominance over Batman.All damaged children in disguise (none of them heroic) the dysfunctional half-menagerie cant help but understand one another. Indeed Batman who was orphaned and Penguin who was abandoned are virtually birds of a feather -- which makes for an interesting relationship that Keaton explores with subtlety. But Burton as usual is focused on his most maniacal character Oscar ""The Penguin"" Cobblepot a deformed sewer-dweller who was raised by zoo penguins after his parents tossed him off Gothams equivalent of the Tallahatchee Bridge. As Christmas approaches he emerges from his underground kingdom claiming to search for his parents when he is really intent on leveling Gotham and grounding Batman.Meanwhile Catwoman a victim of corporate evil and sexual oppression slinks deliciously on the scene. Though predominantly occupied with fighting sex crimes she starts to get in the way of Batmans heroics. A mousy sort before her brain was damaged in a fall she equips herself with a bullwhip and a homemade black vinyl suit proclaiming ""I am Catwoman hear me roar.""Pfeiffer alone brings human vulnerabilities to her role. Its no wonder she is catnip to Batman. He and Catwoman share a Mapplethorpe moment when she whips the rubber-suited one into submission and his bat toes curl. However like so many other promising relationships its never as fully developed as production designer Bo Welshs eye-popping sets and Michael Finks phantasmagoric effects. If only Burton had taken as much care sculpting his scenes.Like a hyperactive 11-year-old the director seems both uncomfortable with adult emotions and unable to focus on the overall portrait. He leaves plot lines dangling like the threads in Catwomans steadily disintegrating catsuit while the screenwriter crafts clever repartee instead of telling a story. Catwoman is a quotable man-basher but all too often she seems to deliver her lines as if shed been spending too much time around Schwarzenegger. At least Pfeiffer in latex is easy to look at. Ditto the vulcanized Keaton.The Penguin on the other hand is designed to remind us of the bleaker aspects of our potty training. Shaped roughly like Humpty Dumpty on thalidomide he is distinguished by the black bile that continuously seeps from his maw like licorice puss. Despite his violent temper and oozing orifices the citizens of Gotham almost elect him mayor. But this flightless angel of death is undone and proceeds with a plan to murder all of Gothams first-born children with an army of explosively charged penguins.""I was my parents number one son but they treated me like number two"" he says by way of explanation. Yet there are few images more whimsical than that of the Penguin navigating the sewers aboard an outsize rubber ducky. For a moment were reminded of the charms of Burtons melancholy fairy tale ""Edward Scissorhands."" But only for a moment. While Edward created art with his disfigured hands the Penguin makes guano.The character albeit energetically played by DeVito works on the movie like a stinking undertow. The title character in Burtons ""Beetlejuice"" came straight from hell and yet we liked him because he remained in some way human. The Penguin has made a beast of himself losing the pain of being human. Doubtless Burton and Waters have buried some cautionary tale in their dank loamy subtext. If we dont start treating our children well they will turn around and destroy us.Unlike so many sequels this summer at least ""Batman Returns"" has something to say. Alas its 45 million budget buys a litany we know all too well urban rot moral decay polluted resources and so on. The point is made that ""people have lost their respect for all icons."" This Perot-esque indictment coincides with the gunning down of Santa Claus and the exploding of a nicely decorated Christmas tree. Be sure and bring the kiddies.

Even more than before this cartoon opera about cloistered personalities bathes exultantly in moody blues gothic music swirls and a symphony of character tragedy.Masterfully conducting the veritable army of actors (including Michael Keaton Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer) and countless other collaborators that constitutes a Hollywood megaproduction director Tim Burton has brought it all home.Well almost all of it. This Warner Bros. movie takes more than two hours and eventually it does feel that way. The beginning is tremendous. The middle is great. But somewhere toward the end your legs may start doing the crossing shuffle.These are minor quibblings. ""Returns"" is in many ways superior to its predecessor. Great efforts have been made to keep up (and exceed) the visual wonder and oomph of the original and it shows. The three-way story involving Keatons Batman DeVitos Penguin and Pfeiffers Catwoman takes place in a wonderland of moody sets by Bo Welch. The costumes the makeup and the visual and mechanical effects -- which include armies of mechanically operated penguins -- are unforgettable.Director Burton not only re-creates his one-of-a-kind atmosphere he one-ups it even two-ups it. Hes best at evoking the psycho-murky worlds in which his characters reside. The Penguin holds court in a penguin-crowded ""Phantom of the Opera""-like sewer home. Keaton hides in a castlelike mansion which perfectly mirrors its owners inner remoteness. Comic strip purists will probably never be happy with a ""Batman"" movie. But ""Returns"" comes closer than ever to Bob Kanes dark original strip which began in 1939.With three villains including an engaging Christopher Walken as sleazy businessman Max Shreck ""Returns"" has much on its plate. In fact Batman himself gets narratively squeezed out. The movie starts with the tragic almost Dickensian beginnings of the Penguin -- played with exquisite tragedy by DeVito. It elucidates the brutal circumstances that launched the feline life of Catwoman (a deliciously purry Pfeiffer). It then intercuts between both villainous principals as they plan their respective revenges.Penguin rejected by his parents and brought up in the Gotham City sewers makes a highly publicized bid to become mayor. Catwoman her cowled identity in victimized response to nasty boss Walken is one angry lethal weapon. Batman stands firmly in their way. Yet all three share angry split-personality reasons for dressing up in costume. Thanks to Daniel (""Heathers"") Waterss multilayered script (based on an original story by Waters and Sam Hamm) you feel for all of them.That busy interplay of plots also leads to a decentralized conclusion in which the combined fates of Batman the Penguin Catwoman -- and even Walkens Shreck -- must all be resolved. At the end theyre almost standing in line for it. Youre not sure where the true finale lies. If you were longing for the intensity of the mano a mano tussle between ""Joker"" Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton in ""Batman"" youre not going to get it here.However you will get Burtons dirgelike appreciation for all the players especially the Penguin. In ways similar to Burtons ""Edward Scissorhands"" this film is a pop-cultural paen to overgrown children in their gothic hideaways. Despite its title ""Batman Returns"" functions touchingly -- if indirectly -- as the Penguins tragic story.
