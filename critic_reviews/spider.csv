With Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst Willem Dafoe James Franco. Directed by Sam Raimi. Running time 121 mins. Rated PG-13 Violence. 3 1/2 Stars. Warning him against taking on more than he can handle Rosemary Harris hospitalized Aunt May tells her headstrong nephew Peter Parker ""Youre not Superman you know? "" No but neither is he the wimp he seems. Parker is secretly Spider-Man and he too can leap tall buildings in a single bound. He cant exactly fly - he gets around New York City on the silk ropes he fires from his wrists to rooftops and cranes - but then hes not vulnerable to Kryptonite either. Every superhero has pluses and minuses - otherwise we wouldnt identify with them - and the star of Sam Raimis exhilarating often hilarious ""Spider-Man"" is no exception. The mutated arachnid that bites Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) during a high school field trip gives him superhuman strength speed and reflexes plus the handy ability to shoot ropes from his wrists. But its his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) who tells him what to do with it (""With great power comes great responsibility"") and its his violent run-ins with the mean Green Goblin that test his ability and courage. ""Spider-Man"" is an almost-perfect extension of the experience of reading comic-book adventures. Technology has given Raimi the ability to make Spider-Man climb and soar to defy gravity with a scientific excuse. The long shots of his sailing through Manhattans canyons are hit and miss on the illusion meter but scenes of him shimmying up the sides of skyscrapers are beautifully imagined and wondrous to behold. He also creates action scenes that seem both realistically violent and abstract choreographing wildly unlikely stunts against the familiar backdrops of New York. Equally important Raimi manages to make his characters come alive - as cartoon figures yes but in a cartoon world that mimics our own to a T. Whether theyre Uncle Ben and Aunt May as caring as they are corny; J. Jonah Jameson (a hilarious J.K. Simmons) the bombastic ethics-challenged editor of the Daily Bugle (housed in the Flatiron Building) or the insane Green Goblin they are a delight to have with us. Taking characters and story lines from several early issues of Marvels Amazing Spider-Man comic books the first film version (a second has already been commissioned with Raimi behind the camera) does precisely what the first ""Superman"" movie did. It introduces its hero shows us how he becomes who he is and turns the tables on school bullies - then takes him through his first crime-fighting adventure. Theres also a love triangle and a dicey father-son relationship that seems likely to be continued in ""Spider-Man 2"" (due in theaters in November 2003). The love triangle involves Parker his next-door neighbor M.J. (Kirsten Dunst) and his best friend Harry (James Franco) whose demanding father (Willem Dafoe) runs a corporate research lab. Harry is the man in the middle of the films two key relationships. Hes dating M.J. behind Peters back and unbeknownst to him his father is the Green Goblin. At the same time Peter was being transformed into a spider-man mutant Harrys father was being transformed into a Jekyll and Hyde monster in a failed experiment. Unlike the samaritan Peter however he comes out with murder and mayhem on his mind. Theres a lot of plot for a simple comic- book story but it doesnt get in the way of the action. ""Spider-Man"" is rife with spectacular action sequences - one taking over Times Square another hair-raiser involving the Roosevelt Island tram. However the real stars as they are in the comic books are the characters and Raimi has cast them perfectly. Like you I blanched at the thought of Tobey Maguire playing Spider-Man and wondered how the scrawny actor would fill out that amazing red-and-blue Spider-Man outfit. But the actor pumped some iron and Raimis effects geniuses and stunt men did the rest. Whoevers in that suit looks good. In the Peter Parker role Maguire is perfect. Those doe eyes and stammering speech make him a perfect stand-in Everyman and his inherent shy-guy amiability adds credibility to the simmering romance between him and M.J. Dunst who participates in one of the most gratuitous wet T-shirt scenes since ""Wild Party Girls Spring Break Uncensored"" adds enough sex appeal to turn any spider into an animal. Then theres Dafoe fresh off his turn as Nosferatu in ""Shadow of the Vampire"" and still essentially in character. With his snarl and menacing voice the bony-faced actor puts the scare in archvillain and takes Spider-Man to the max. Let the summer begin.

Spider-Man creates likeable hero with predictable battles | Peninsula Clarion Toggle navigation Home News Local Sports Opinion Outdooors Weather Subscribe Obits Classifieds Classifieds Local Jobs Real Estate Search Spider-Man creates likeable hero with predictable battles Posted Thursday May 09 2002 By DAVID GERMAINAP Movie Writer Oh the hardships of the sensitive teen-age boy. Plotting a future. Trying to catch the eye of the girl next door. Adapting to changes in his body including those pesky cobweb emissions and the tiny clingy hairs that make scaling walls a snap. Along comes Spider-Man perhaps the most awaited comic-book adaptation since well the dawn of the comic book. No stranger to such stylized fantasy worlds director Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead Dark-man Army of Darkness) has admirably synthesized 40 years of crime-fighting from the pages of Marvel Comics into an energetic romp that captures the spirit of Spideys universe with reverence and affection. With the awkward charm of a good boy slowly blooming Tobey Maguire is an inspired choice for the lead. And with its sweetly sad underpinning of romantic longing and uneasy friendship -- plus a demented villain who evokes sympathy amid his blustering -- Spider-Man sometimes rises above the comic-book trappings to conjure real sentiment. The X-men movie had deeper intellect but Spider-Man has a stronger heart. Maguire stars as Peter Parker a high-school science geek picked on by classmates and unnoticed by his secret love Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Peters only friend is rich kid Harry Osborn (James Franco) son of wealthy researcher Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). An orphan Peter lives with his doting uncle and aunt (Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris). Bitten by an irradiated spider on a science field trip Peter awakens the next morning to find his body more muscled and toned and his eyeglasses no longer needed. He soon discovers he can leap great bounds cling to walls spew heavy strands of web from his wrists and sense approaching danger. Now the Uber-arachnid on the block Peter initially figures to cash in on his abilities as the Amazing Spider-Man until a tragedy turns him to a life of crime-fighting surfing his webs from building to building across Manhattan in search of good deeds to do. Meantime Norman Osborn has subjected himself to experimental human-performance enhancers that turn him into a super-maniac. In Jekyll-and-Hyde fashion Osborn continues his regular life while periodically transforming into Spider-Mans archrival the Green Goblin cruising around town on a floating glider hurling grenades and otherwise causing mayhem. While Spider-Mans traditional red-and-blue duds translate to the big screen with minimal corniness the Green Goblin is stuck in goofy emerald armor whose big-snouted face looks like an early design reject for the gargoyles of Notre Dame. Dafoes best moments come in schizoid debates between the tremulous Osborn and his snarling alter ego his internal struggle eliciting occasional compassion among viewers. With earnest unpretentious delivery Maguire is an eminently likable hero audiences will root for from his earliest moments as the class wimp. Dunst adds her habitual spunk though Mary Jane is little more than a damsel endlessly requiring rescue. Francos role is negligible but the film nicely establishes the comic books conflict between Harry and Spider-Man for sequels (installment two of the franchise already is in the works). The action sequences generally are fun though repetitive. Youd think you would never tire of seeing a guy in red-and-blue jammies sailing around the New York skyline on self-made spider tethers. But it does get old. Theres also a sameness about the rumbles between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin. Every few minutes Gobby turns up to bellow at Spidey lob a grenade or two and trade punches. The hero-villain dynamic is undercooked with the Green Goblin an overblown variant of the bullies who picked on Peter in school. Personal rivalry between good and bad guys is a major element of action comics but the best film adaptations shoot for a broader fight with villains hatching dastardly schemes of mass destruction or conquest (think Gene Hackman in Superman Jack Nicholson in Batman Ian McKellen in X-Men). Taking out their superhero nemeses often is a bonus to the evildoers whereas in Spider-Man it becomes the driving goal for the Green Goblin whose localized malevolence makes him more nuisance than menace in Manhattan.

"Spider-Man swings along with brio Slate Sign In Sign Up Spider-Man swings along with brio Spider-Man swings along with brio Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 3 2002 1051 AM Eight Legs To Hold You Spider-Man swings along with brio; Hollywood Ending should send Woody Allen running back to drama. By David Edelstein Tobey Maguire catches Kirsten Dunst in his web When Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) calls ""Wait--who are you?"" to the figure in the spider-suit who has carried her from a scene of carnage you can almost see Tobey Maguire blush. You cant really of course His red webbed spider mask is opaque. But you know how smitten his Peter Parker is with Mary Jane and how a look from Kirsten Dunst--with that wide-open face atop those long stems--would make anyone blush. And you know from the way he freezes and the angle of his head that hes tempted to turn and say ""Its me Peter Parker and Ive loved you all my life""; and you can hear the goofy grin in his voice when he finally comes out with ""Just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man."" This archetypal superhero scene is acted and directed so simply and with such radiant sincerity that you might forget for a moment youre in the middle of a special-effects-engorged extravaganza--the first chapter of a new Hollywood ""franchise."" You might think youre watching a charming love story. Advertisement At its best Spider-Man (Sony Pictures) takes the adolescent yearning at the heart of most superhero sagas and gives it a lovely swing. The script by David Koepp isnt inspired but it keeps the emotional beats clean and director Sam Raimi treats his hero tenderly He gives him space to watch and think as well as act. Raimi doesnt overcomplicate things. The Marvel Spider-Man comic was born at the beginning of the Pop Art era--its colors are primary. Unlike Bruce Waynes Batman and Bruce Banners Incredible Hulk Peter Parkers Spider-Man has no metaphoric component. The spider persona doesnt emanate from any aspect of Parkers troubled psyche--its just a cool conceit. And because Parkers powers are extrinsic Tobey Maguire can be Spider-Man and stand outside Spider-Man too. That soft face is not the face of a superhero--which is the whole hilarious point. This is a star-making performance as fresh and funny as Christopher Reeves in Superman (1978). Maguire has a wary uninsistent presence with just a hint of yeasty morbidity to keep him from seeming beatific. He internalizes everything which is perfect for a character who doesnt have any awareness of his body until a genetically altered spider sinks its fangs into him. Then after a night of clammy sweats Parker finds himself in a new frame with muscles 20/20 vision and oh yes the ability to make webs jet out of his palm. The scenes in which Maguire contemplates his weird new excretions are like the Marvel Comics version of David Cronenbergs The Fly (1986)--theres no decay only giddy enhancement. Arachnid-Man The villain the Green Goblin is enhanced too--but hes not giddy hes a big drag. Hes the result of a wayward experiment by millionaire military-industrial scientist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) and hed be a good warm-up superbaddy an aperitif. Surfing around skyscrapers with his elongated reptilian helmet-head hes like H.R. Gigers alien hanging ten and Raimi delights in putting Goblins and Spider-Mans heads together for protracted dialogues Neither has a mouth that moves so these are amusingly akin to comic-book frames. But the Goblin is a dull brute. Peculiarly fixated on winning Spider-Man over to his side his attempted seductions are tiresome and hes no more compelling when he confronts Osborn his human alter ego in the mirror a la Hyde taunting Jekyll. Dafoe whose face from the start is a cadaverous mask has barely enough variety for one character let alone two. It would be more fun to see Spider-Man battle J. Jonah Jameson editor of the New York Post-like tabloid for which Parker takes photos (mostly of Spider-Man) As played by J.K. Simmons (Dr. Emil on Law and Order) hes a dazzling fount of bumptiousness. (Quick Someone revive The Front Page We have the greatest Walter Burns of our time) The action sequences may bother some people who find it hard to get off post-9/11 on seeing Manhattan office buildings crumble or trams full of kids dangling by a (spider) thread. But Im not sure these scenes would have been the highlights of Spider-Man anyway. The effects are impersonal. One of the highest compliments you can pay a studio-tooled blockbuster is to say that it would hold the screen without the computer-generated spectacle. Spider-Man would hold the screen even better maybe since thered be more of Maguire and less of his virtual-reality action double who swings from building to building with the inhuman ease and fluidity of a video-game protagonist. Theres nothing magical about these sequences because we know that artificial entities in computer universes can do whatever they want. We miss the thrill that comes from watching real acrobats whether theyre Jackie Chan Gene Kelly or trapeze artists at the circus; we miss their weight their conquest of gravity the element of danger in what they do. Advertisement We miss a certain kind of cinematic invention too. The director Peter Sellars after being fired from his first Broadway production said hed never done so little good work in his life because whenever a problem arose he could just throw money at it--whereas much creativity is a consequence of figuring out how to get from A to D without going through B and C. Consider The Evil Dead (1982). Unable to afford a Steadicam for shots meant to evoke a demon rushing toward a cabin Raimi and his crew mounted a camera to a long board and let two guys run with it. They called it a ""Shakicam"" and the jiggly whoosh is much more thrilling than any big-bucks Steadicam. Raimi brought a touch of low-budget Shakicam funk to Darkman (1990) and Spider-Man could have used a little too. Since abandoning grisly slapstick a decade ago Raimi has quietly learned in such films as A Simple Plan (1998) and The Gift (2000) to tell classical stories and bring out the soul in his actors. But I miss the anarchic sense of fun that he once brought to action. Inhuman speed and fluidity are a poor substitute for that cackle that used to infuse his every frame. Woody Allen and Treat Williams kvetch The cackle is gone from Woody Allens movies too and Hollywood Ending--the third of his broad comedies for DreamWorks--had me wishing hed go back to drama. Did I just write that? I cant be serious. ... I think Im serious. Hollywood Ending is a strange sort of fiasco--more interesting than Small Time Crooks (2000) and Curse of the Jade Scorpion (2001) but more depressing too You can see the potential and you can also see the places where Allen didnt (couldnt?) rise to the occasion. He plays a washed-up director who--thanks to a campaign by his ex-wife (Tea Leoni) whos engaged to marry a studio head (Treat Williams)--lands a job directing a big-budget Manhattan melodrama and promptly goes blind. You dont have to be a therapist to see the subtext here--though its announced by a therapist (among others) in the picture itself. Allen has dramatized an aging filmmakers worst nightmare a fantasy of creative impotence in which every artistic (and personal) gesture is a stab in the dark. The trouble is that Allen thinks of slapstick comedy as a Lesser Form. His audience--and potential financing--having dwindled over the years hes here under duress. Hes rehashing old themes (masturbation jokes anyone?) and going through old motions for a public he doesnt respect. At times he seems to be satirizing himself for being out of touch but his snobbery is stronger than ever (only Tea Leonis blessedly dry sane line readings keep her character from looking like an idiot) and the thrust of the thing is that the culture has grown coarser while he has clung stubbornly to his aesthetic refinement. Allen has complained for so long about comedy being ""the childrens table"" that he might have forgotten how difficult it was to hold his place at it--that as blindingly brilliant as his instincts were he probably had to work harder and at a higher level of inspiration on Bananas (1971) than on say his Chekhov or Ingmar Bergman retreads. There is nothing wrong with Hollywood Ending that two or three more drafts wouldnt have fixed. He might have realized for one thing that he was building to a punch line that never comes a scene or two from the blind directors hilariously disjointed final product in which none of the camera angles make sense and nothing cuts together. Here was an occasion for Allen to use his genius for parody to contrive a deliberately chaotic syntax--to play as puckishly with form as he did back in Whats Up Tiger Lily? (1966). Instead people comment on the disaster as in an old drawing-room comedy. The picture ends with a funny but oddly self-destructive jab at France (home of Allens most loyal fans now that Vincent Canby is gone) and a Dramamine joke. Hollywood Ending looks gorgeous by the way--elegant and spacious with a beautiful bronze-orange palette. (The cinematographer was Wedigo von Schultzendorff a name that sounds as if it should be the punch line to something.) But the timing is off in almost every scene which leads one to believe that the director was deaf instead of blind.

This action epic turns expectations upside down too. When comic-book superheroes go forth in their long underwear on the big screen its usually the human story that gets short shrift. Not this time though. Mr. Maguire who proves to be a fine choice for the title role turns Peter from a bookish schoolboy of convincing intelligence and touching sensitivity into a daring young man who doesnt need a trapeze to fly but wants desperately to be loved and understood. If only ""Spider-Man"" had a villain worthy of its hero. If only its villainy visited with shattering violence on a mythic version of Manhattan didnt keep reminding us of all-too-recent reality. Any doubts about Mr. Maguires fitness to play Spidey -- I confess to having had my own -- centered on his unexceptional physique not his acting technique. Always interesting to watch hes become a distinctive performer who seems to do mysteriously little or next to nothing in the course of creating characters with almost palpable interior lives. The movie which Sam Raimi directed with a confident touch from a screenplay by David Koepp capitalizes on this gift in a leisurely but beguiling preface. First Peter discovers his special powers the result of a special spiders biting him during a school field trip. (Though liberties have been taken with some details of this transformation the script is faithful as a whole to its Marvel Comics source material.) Next he reinvents himself and not just physically or sartorially though theres a funny rousing scene in which he wears his new costume in a bout with a professional wrestler. More to the point of Mr. Maguires strong suit Peter grows emotionally. Its fun to see this shy cautious kid come into the fullness of his powers with a deepening sense of wonder accompanied by appropriate self-delight. So what about the actor as action hero? Doubts fall away when Spidey squirting an inexplicably inexhaustible supply of web juice from the palms of both sticky-fingered hands soars to the rooftops then swings along the great citys steel canyons in acrobatic pursuit of his first bad guy. (A very bad guy who did a terrible thing in which Spidey himself feels complicit.) Thrilling moments like this are heightened by the sweet unaffected performance of Ms. Dunst as Mary Jane whom Peter loves and who loves Spidey without realizing his true identity. Indeed ""Spider-Man"" promises for a good long while to keep us adults and kids alike in happy thrall with a combination of stylish action and endearing romance. But thats before the screen is torn asunder by Willem Dafoes Green Goblin the mad monster who lurks within Norman Osborn a merely unpleasant tycoon and arms manufacturer. (Peter is best friends with Normans son Harry Osborn who played blandly by James Franco promises to be one of Spideys adversaries in the sequel.) Every action adventure needs a memorable villain but no movie needs the strident intensity of Mr. Dafoe who either has no interest in or no grasp of the sort of charmingly malign wit that Gene Hackman brought to ""Superman"" or Jack Nicholson to ""Batman."" And even worse than what the Goblin is -- a screaming bore aboard a heavily armed high-tech glider -- is what the Goblin does to Manhattans towers. Not the World Trade Center towers to be sure but several tall buildings in a harrowing sequence of destruction that comes perilously close to evoking a terrorist attack and its fiery aftermath. Clearly the resemblances were accidental with practical constraints of time and budget on what could be done by way of blurring or excising them. Still I was shocked by these scenes and by my own reaction to them Will I ever be able to see such images again as entertainment? It will be interesting to learn if young audiences -- the movies rating is PG-13 -- have managed to shed their own vulnerabilities in this regard. I certainly hope so and I wish the movie well. Coarse mayhem notwithstanding ""Spider-Man"" will probably provoke a pandemic of arachnophilia. Hollywood Ending Woody Allens ""Hollywood Ending"" has a great title -- remarkable that its never been used before -- and a great performance by Tea Leoni. Shes the movies anchor its rock. She validates everyone around her by keeping her own work marvelously sharp smart and truthful. Its thanks to her that we stay tuned to Mr. Allens comic premise long after it has gone from delightfully outrageous to off-puttingly preposterous. He plays a washed-up director Val Waxman. She plays Ellie his ex-wife who has left him for Hal (Treat Williams) an amiable philistine of a studio chief. When Ellie mentions her ex at a studio meeting as a candidate to direct a new movie set in Manhattan Hal dismisses him as a ""raving incompetent psychotic."" Ellie insists blithely that hes not incompetent ""The streets of New York are in his marrow."" Obviously all of this cuts close to the bone Woody Allen is hardly washed up but its been a good while since hes had a resounding hit. At first he sends himself up very high and very fast. Val wants to shoot the film called ""The City That Never Sleeps"" with a hand-held camera -- just like the one though its never said here that made moviegoers queasy in ""Husbands and Wives."" Val also wants to shoot in black-and-white because as Woody did say in ""Manhattan"" ""New York is a black-and-white town."" Soon the send-up and self-irony turn startlingly -- and quite pitilessly -- savage. The alter Allen ego hurtles beyond Woodys familiar hypochondria -- Val even believes he has suffered from elm disease -- into a fearful frenzy that can be restrained if not tamed only by Ellies patience and unflappable common sense. Some of Vals antics are funny in their own right and they cast a baleful light on the craziness of the movie business. But then Val goes psychosomatically blind and what might have been a plot device sufficiently rich to sustain a few scenes becomes an engine of self-destruction. Almost half of ""Hollywood Ending"" is given over to the directors desperate efforts to direct a film he cant see. Its hilarious for a while; also anxiety-provoking in an interesting way and even moving as Val or Val/Woody becomes ever more helpless and looks shockingly old and sad. (And is still accepted as a cockeyed genius like the retarded gardener played by Peter Sellers in ""Being There."") But comedy must be grounded in some sort of reality and we sense a fundamental falsehood here. Whether Val Waxman is really functionally blind or able to see without consciously registering what he sees his indecision and discombobulation are so extreme that you cant believe hed last two days on his own set. As Val stumbles and fumbles along in the movie within the movie ""Hollywood Ending"" founders too. A scene of tender reminiscence between him and Ellie feels recycled synthetic. A didactic encounter with an alienated son is dead in the water. And when Val and Ellie finally acknowledge their love for one another its not a Hollywood ending so much as a Woody Allen ending with Woody winning yet again a wonderful woman whos much too young for him. Thats real blindness and it aint funny.  VIDEO TIP Theres only so much you can do with real spiders as villains and ""Arachnophobia"" (1990) does it with more ingenuity than one might reasonably expect. Frank Marshall directed from a script credited to Don Jakoby and Wesley Strick. Jeff Daniels is a young doctor who lives in dread of spiders and John Goodman plays an exterminator. Hes the guy who gives the creatures periodic squirts of poison and the movie welcome jolts of energy.

Tobey Maguire is something else. This superhero--Spider-Man by name--really is a vulnerable kid when the costume comes off and it makes a big difference it gives this 120 million production a tone it can call its own. Casting Maguire as Peter Parker the high-school outcast who gains superhuman powers after he is bitten by a mutant arachnid automatically alters the scale of this Marvel Comics transplant. With his quiet voice saucer eyes and tight bow tie of a smile Maguire is such a minimalist actor that the camera is obliged to observe him in close-up where his subtle sweetness can be savored. Director Sam Raimi working from David Koepps screenplay wisely anchors his big action-adventure flick on Maguires modest but beguiling persona.There are plenty of FX on display in ""Spider-Man""--some dazzling some clunky some so clearly computer-generated they fail to astonish the way a good old-fashioned stunt could. But the good news is that the film doesnt feel pushy and overproduced. It has a B-movie unpretentiousness a nice sense of humor an endearing corniness and some real chemistry between Maguire and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson the beautiful next-door neighbor Peter has worshiped in vain since childhood. (The movies most bizarre image may be their first kiss with her standing up and Spider-Man hanging from his feet theres something hilariously obscene about this innocent upside-down smooch.)Its best not to expect too much of this movie its nothing to get terribly excited about. The best moments come when Peter first discovers and tries out his new powers--scaling buildings spinning webs leaping from building to building. Appearing in a tacky early draft of his spider costume he enters a pro-wrestling contest hoping to win a 3000 cash prize. Once he becomes a full-fledged crime-fighting superhero however and his archenemy the Green Goblin appears ""Spider-Man"" begins to resemble a dozen other gung-ho summer entertainments. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The Goblin is Peters dark mirror image. Hes another human accidentally altered into a superbeing weapons manufacturer Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) a Jekyll-and-Hyde schizo lusting for ultimate power. Dafoe hurls himself gamely into this comic-book villain but its hard not to have a ""been there done that"" response to this battle between good and evil. This isnt the last time well be getting that feeling deja vu is Hollywoods favorite ingredient this summer. But even at its most generic Raimis amiable movie doesnt forget its human scale. So two cheers for ""Spider-Man.""

The man is better company than the spider in ""Spider-Man."" The long-awaited bigscreen incarnation of the 40-year-old Marvel Comics superhero emerges as a perfectly serviceable early-summer popcorn picture that will satisfy its core teen constituency and not displease general viewers looking for some disposable entertainment. In a perfectly competent film thats critically lacking in true inspiration or a poetic imagination that would take it to an exciting level pics happiest surprise is Tobey Maguire in the title role as the young actor provides an emotional openness and vulnerability that gives this 120 million production its most distinctive flavor. With a May 3 opening this Sony release will spin a huge B.O. web during the two weeks before the ""Clones"" arrive and then hang in nicely for some time thereafter. Ancillary prospects and public want-see for projected sequels look very strong. From his first appearance in ""Amazing Fantasy"" in 1962 Stan Lee and Steve Ditkos arachnid crime fighter stood out from the pack of other comic do-gooders by virtue of his humble background. Quite unlike the otherworldly Superman/Clark Kent and the millionaire Batman/Bruce Wayne Peter Parker was a bashful clumsy ultra-straight 98-pound weakling from working-class Queens. And so he remains in Sam Raimis picture the orphaned bespectacled high school senior mercilessly picked on by class jocks as he moons over pretty redhead Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) whom he cant work up the nerve to talk to even though theyve lived next door to one another since diaper days. Pics first and better half is devoted to Peters makeover from campus dweeb to physically unique righter-of-wrongs. While visiting a Columbia U. science lab Peter is bitten by a mutant blue-and-red spider. Next day his vision is perfect and hes newly buff and it isnt long before he discovers hes capable of spinning industrial-strength webs and walking up buildings. He first uses his new strength and acrobatic skills to dispatch Mary Janes a-hole b.f. in a school fight then thinks to impress her by earning money in a wrestling challenge matched against a monster named Bone Saw. This entire apprenticeship section was always going to live or die on the charm and appeal of the actor playing Peter and the initial sweet sensitivity Maguire conveys followed by the growing thrill of self-discovery of his new superhuman abilities proves captivating. Peters strictly larky use of his powers comes to an unwelcome end when his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) who with wife May (Rosemary Harris) has raised the boy is killed in a Manhattan carjacking. Donning Spider-Man gear and swinging via self-generated threads from building to building like an urban Tarzan he dispatches the culprit while deftly eluding police seizure. Already in this early major action sequence though something feels a bit off; the movement seems herky-jerky the pursuit unnecessarily hurried so that while the sight of the young crime-buster gallivanting through the nocturnal canyons of New York City is impressive it lacks the desired visceral thrill. Naturally Spider-Man requires an adversary and he gets one in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) an armor-plated fiend who zips around like a rabid snowboarder on a heavily armed glider dropping pumpkin bombs on uncomprehending foes. Like Spider-Man the Goblin has a human identity that of Norman Osborn an ousted corporate arms manufacturer who becomes a Jekyll-and-Hyde upon consuming an experimental formula of his own devising. Unlike Peter Norman cant control when he slips into his alternate self and Dafoes best moments come when the two sides of his personality argue with one another and flip back and forth as quickly as a light switch. Unfortunately when ""Spider-Man"" settles into full superhero mode an hour in the conventional contours of David Koepps script come fully to the fore. With the Green Goblin committing such heinous acts as blitzing a World Unity Festival in Times Square toplining Macy Gray and threatening to drop Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island tram loaded with kids into the East River he and Spider-Man face off in increasingly standard-issue good guy/bad guy fashion with no bigger issues to give their rivalry special import. Further deflating the balloon is an abundance of over-cranked digital physical action thats singularly lacking in grace or the feel of real movement human or animal. Welcome compensation comes in the form of Peters continued pursuit of Mary Jane who remains oblivious to his dual personality for some time but eventually warms to his newfound confidence. For many teenage boys pics highlight will not be found among the action interludes but rather in the scene of Mary Jane her flimsy shirt drenched by rain peeling back the lower part of Spider-Mans facemask in order to kiss him while hes hanging upside down in a dark street. Ironically its when ""Spider-Man"" sticks to simple human interaction that the film breathes and ingratiates itself. Chemistry between Maguire and the winning Dunst is excellent and there are good moments too between Maguire and James Franco who plays Normans unhappy son and Peters only friend at school as well as with Robertson and Harris as Peters doting substitute parents. Cackling behind his armored Goblin costume Dafoe is stuck with routine villainy when not writhing through his transformations while standout supporting turn is served up by J.K. Simmons who brilliantly catches his pieces comicbook origins while snapping out funny one-liners as a cynical newspaper editor. Physically imposing production is notable for Neil Spisaks production design which involves considerable invention but also allows New York City to play itself without Gotham City-like stylization. James Achesons costumes beginning with the terrific ribbed Spider-Man outfit are splendid Danny Elfmans score punches things up in customary form and Don Burgess lensing while accommodating the countless effects makes the actors look great.

Directed by Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead et al) this 2002 blockbuster offers several kinetic and exciting chase scenes and Tobey Maguire is charming as the insecure superhero. Unfortunately the film like many of its ilk is driven by special effects and theres a serious disconnect between Maguires sweet-natured dialogue and Spider-Mans pounding violence and stunning acrobatic work. Willem Dafoe costars as the evil father figure harboring his own secret identity as the villainous Green Goblin; Kirsten Dunst is the marginally troubled love interest; and the fine TV actor J.K.

Are you sure you want to know?) this accomplished blockbuster announces itself as a stylish piece of pop myth-spinning. Director and writer afford the old Marvel comic strip the reverence film-makers used to reserve for the Scriptures - which is not to suggest that they miss the fun of it. Every inch the nerds nerd Maguire is adroitly cast as Peter Parker a brainy orphan with a suppressed wild streak and a lot of growing up to do. When the worm turns (courtesy of a GM spider bite) his elation is palpable a testosterone rush which sends him sky-high. The first thing is to score some greenbacks to impress the red-head next door (Dunst). Meanwhile. Dafoes arms inventor Norman Osborn is the fly in the ointment trying on his own altered ego - the Green Goblin - to test-Spider-boys moral mettle. Despite the movies solid storytelling virtues it must be admitted that the action spectacular scenes are a somewhat disappointing and that Dunst is little more than an old-style scream queen.

Because of the balance of action thrill humour and drama really makes the characters come to life and feel convincing. Spider-man isnt like other superheroes who have comfortable lifestyles he is just basically just your average Joe who has social job love and teenaged problems that we all go through and that is why the character is so believable. In short Spider-man is just your ordinary guy who has superpowers and the responsibility of using them to help others. I thought that Tobey Maguire was the perfect choice for Spider-man and within seconds you know that nobody could do a better job than him. He helps the characters soul develop and does an awesome job in bringing out those noble and heroic qualities with relative ease. In the beginning the title credits were good and the first few words of narration made sure that this is gonna be one of the best movies ever. The first few minutes of this movie straight away explains how complex Peters life is and how much he loves Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) so others can immediately identify with Peter and his personal problems which is simply lacking in other superhero films. Most other superheroes have fancy life styles and earn alot of money and are on top of there game. Because of this most people dont have anything in common with them. Take Superman for example. I aint saying hes totally crap but it can be tedious to read about someone like him; hes not from this planet hes invinsible and he lives in Metropolis which doesnt even exist. So anyway about Peter his life aint totally perfect but he has a rich best friend Harry (despite his wealth he still has lots of life problems) and he has a major crush on Mary Jane Watson. James Franco does an exemplary job as confused Harry and Kirsten Dunst makes it obvious for why Peter would fall in love with her. They also make there characters realistic just like Tobey Maguire does Spider-Man and Peter Parker. The first scene is able to show nerdy unpopular and bullied Peter is and that makes you feel sorry for him. In the next scene there is a school science trip and that is where he gets bit by a spider while taking photos of Mary Jane. He then goes home and were introduced to Aunt May and Uncle Ben who raised Peter since he was orphaned at an early age. Cliff Robertson easily manages to establish Uncle Bens character as an important figure in Peters life in such a short amount of screen time and Rosemary Harris also does an excellent job in portraying a frail yet caring Aunt May. They ask how the field trip is going but since Peter wasnt feeling well because of the bite he goes upstairs and faints. The acting in that scene was very convincing in my book. In the same scene Norman turns into the green goblin after testing his unstable performance enhancers and at the same time becoming criminally insane. In that scene Willem Dafoe nails the insanity and anger of Osborn perfectly. When Peter wakes up the next day he discovers that he has muscles which wows him. In school he has a fight with Flash Thompson and kicks his ass like hell and it showed that Peter was through taking Flashes crap which was pretty cool and fun to watch. After the discovery of his new found powers he tries to get money from a wrestling match to buy a car to impress Mary Jane. To go there he tells his aunt and uncle that he is going to the library so his uncle gives him a ride. In that scene he explains to Peter that with great power comes great responsibility. And as we all know he uses his power irresponsibly. He kicks the crap out of Bonesaw which was awesomely choreographed. In that scene Bruce Campbell does a cameo and is very funny. The fight promoter cheats Peter and when the dude gets robbed Peter doesnt give a crap so he lets him get away. After that incident Peter finds out that uncle Ben dies and uses his powers to catch the killer. The web swinging scenes were spectacular and energetic and there was lots of anger and guilt when he find out the killer was the dude he didnt stop at the fight promoters office. Then he swears that he wont let anything bad happen to anyone anymore and he becomes Spider-man and fights the Green Goblin. Throughout the film we see Spider-mans character progress and mature throughout the film. He learns how to deal with his teenaged problems and tries to balance his life as a superhero and as a normal person. He also learns to control his powers; to compare the first swing with the final swing is like night and day as he has more control in the final swing comparing the first swing. His gets stronger and more agile and combat improves as more fight scenes come and go. The action scenes in this movie are very brutal and they are awesome to look at. There are a handful of them and never fail to keep you entertained. They are properly choreographed so that they can emphasise Spider-man as a strong but agile figure and the Green Goblin as menacing and brutal fighter easily and effectively. The movie not only contains great action scenes but also provides some humour and awkward moments that are very entertaining. Take J.Jonah Jameson (the great J.K. Simmons) for example; he provides us with funny moments such as when Peter brings Spider-man photos he goes ""There crap crap mega crap. Ill give you 200 bucks for all of them.""

Because of the balance of action thrill humour and drama really makes the characters come to life and feel convincing. Spider-man isnt like other superheroes who have comfortable lifestyles he is just basically just your average Joe who has social job love and teenaged problems that we all go through and that is why the character is so believable. In short Spider-man is just your ordinary guy who has superpowers and the responsibility of using them to help others. I thought that Tobey Maguire was the perfect choice for Spider-man and within seconds you know that nobody could do a better job than him. He helps the characters soul develop and does an awesome job in bringing out those noble and heroic qualities with relative ease. In the beginning the title credits were good and the first few words of narration made sure that this is gonna be one of the best movies ever. The first few minutes of this movie straight away explains how complex Peters life is and how much he loves Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) so others can immediately identify with Peter and his personal problems which is simply lacking in other superhero films. Most other superheroes have fancy life styles and earn alot of money and are on top of there game. Because of this most people dont have anything in common with them. Take Superman for example. I aint saying hes totally crap but it can be tedious to read about someone like him; hes not from this planet hes invinsible and he lives in Metropolis which doesnt even exist. So anyway about Peter his life aint totally perfect but he has a rich best friend Harry (despite his wealth he still has lots of life problems) and he has a major crush on Mary Jane Watson. James Franco does an exemplary job as confused Harry and Kirsten Dunst makes it obvious for why Peter would fall in love with her. They also make there characters realistic just like Tobey Maguire does Spider-Man and Peter Parker. The first scene is able to show nerdy unpopular and bullied Peter is and that makes you feel sorry for him. In the next scene there is a school science trip and that is where he gets bit by a spider while taking photos of Mary Jane. He then goes home and were introduced to Aunt May and Uncle Ben who raised Peter since he was orphaned at an early age. Cliff Robertson easily manages to establish Uncle Bens character as an important figure in Peters life in such a short amount of screen time and Rosemary Harris also does an excellent job in portraying a frail yet caring Aunt May. They ask how the field trip is going but since Peter wasnt feeling well because of the bite he goes upstairs and faints. The acting in that scene was very convincing in my book. In the same scene Norman turns into the green goblin after testing his unstable performance enhancers and at the same time becoming criminally insane. In that scene Willem Dafoe nails the insanity and anger of Osborn perfectly. When Peter wakes up the next day he discovers that he has muscles which wows him. In school he has a fight with Flash Thompson and kicks his ass like hell and it showed that Peter was through taking Flashes crap which was pretty cool and fun to watch. After the discovery of his new found powers he tries to get money from a wrestling match to buy a car to impress Mary Jane. To go there he tells his aunt and uncle that he is going to the library so his uncle gives him a ride. In that scene he explains to Peter that with great power comes great responsibility. And as we all know he uses his power irresponsibly. He kicks the crap out of Bonesaw which was awesomely choreographed. In that scene Bruce Campbell does a cameo and is very funny. The fight promoter cheats Peter and when the dude gets robbed Peter doesnt give a crap so he lets him get away. After that incident Peter finds out that uncle Ben dies and uses his powers to catch the killer. The web swinging scenes were spectacular and energetic and there was lots of anger and guilt when he find out the killer was the dude he didnt stop at the fight promoters office. Then he swears that he wont let anything bad happen to anyone anymore and he becomes Spider-man and fights the Green Goblin. Throughout the film we see Spider-mans character progress and mature throughout the film. He learns how to deal with his teenaged problems and tries to balance his life as a superhero and as a normal person. He also learns to control his powers; to compare the first swing with the final swing is like night and day as he has more control in the final swing comparing the first swing. His gets stronger and more agile and combat improves as more fight scenes come and go. The action scenes in this movie are very brutal and they are awesome to look at. There are a handful of them and never fail to keep you entertained. They are properly choreographed so that they can emphasise Spider-man as a strong but agile figure and the Green Goblin as menacing and brutal fighter easily and effectively. The movie not only contains great action scenes but also provides some humour and awkward moments that are very entertaining. Take J.Jonah Jameson (the great J.K. Simmons) for example; he provides us with funny moments such as when Peter brings Spider-man photos he goes ""There crap crap mega crap. Ill give you 200 bucks for all of them."" The way he says it gives you chuckles. The scene where Spidey has his upside down kiss is know famous and often parodied.

"Spin control - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Spin controlWeb-shooting Tobey Maguire and company bring the Spider-Man comic book to an enjoyable yet restrained big-screen lifeSpider-man(star)(star)(star)May 03 2002|By Mark Caro Tribune movie reporter.A big-screen well-appointed ""Spider-Man"" is a hard concept to screw up and director Sam Raimi ultimately doesnt. The movie does what it has to do puts this most populist of comic-book superheroes at the center of a colorful computer-enhanced popcorn entertainment.Its got appealing performers as the leads -- Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson -- as well as a formidable villain in the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn played with a heaping scoop of relish by Willem Dafoe.And its got the peoples superhero. Superman is an alien the X-Men are mutants and Batman is some dark haunted guy living in a stylized gothic version of America but Spidey is just an everyday teen who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and gains special -- and especially fun -- powers.Whats surprising then is how thin the material comes to feel. Although the first sequel already has been ordered (Columbia knows it has marketed a blockbuster) by the end of this introductory installment the tank seems near empty.The screenplay by David Koepp (""Panic Room"" and the first two ""Jurassic Park"" movies) a writer whos better at moving characters from place to place than providing strong connective tissue or memorable dialogue streamlines Spider-Mans back story efficiently. High school senior Peter Parker is an unpopular science-minded dweeb being raised by his kindly Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson).Gwen Stacy Peters blond girlfriend whos shockingly killed in the comic book ""The Amazing Spider-Man 121"" has been deleted and Peters fetching red-haired classmate Mary Jane has taken on some of her traits. Although shes lived next door for years Peter can barely work up the nerve to talk to her before that spider bite on a field trip.Although the movie omits Peters comic-book revelation of jumping away from a speeding car and winding up affixed to a building the scenes of Peter discovering his powers and swinging around Manhattan contain an exuberance too rarely seen in superhero movies which tend to emphasize the burdens of superpowers. When Peter draws multiple versions of his Spider-Man get-up hes living out the dream of every kid who has imagined himself as a superhero.In the comic book Peter manufactures his web-shooting mechanism but here that phenomenon happens organically; when he flicks his wrist those sticky webs spurt out. Although the change may offend purists it makes dramatic sense and reinforces the theme that Peters new physical gifts are a metaphor for puberty.Norman Osborn the rich father of Peters friend Harry (James Franco) also gains superpowers when an experiment goes awry and half of his personality is taken over by the maniacal sky-gliding fireball-hurling Green Goblin. Initially driven to take revenge on double-crossing business associates Norman/Goblin becomes an all-purpose New York terrorist.Although the movie was filmed before Sept. 11 that tragic day seems to inform the film such as in the closing shot of Spidey and the American flag and the scene in which an angry New Yorker among a crowd throwing debris at the Green Goblin proclaims ""You mess with one of us you mess with all of us""Since his ""Evil Dead"" days Raimi has been a fan of fancy camera movements and his ""Spider-Man"" certainly looks lively with lots of swooping and swinging to capture the heros acrobatics. The computer effects dont usually draw too much attention to themselves though sometimes Spider-Man looks like a cartoon.Maintaining a consistent tone is not however this directors strong suit. J.K. Simmons is a hoot as grousing Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson but the ""His Girl Friday""-goes-to-the-cartoons flavor of his exchanges with Peter isnt matched elsewhere certainly not in Peters occasional glum voice-overs.Raimi inserts numerous ""Superman"" nods including a gratuitous shot of Peter running and ripping open his shirt to reveal the Spider-Man logo. But while the first ""Superman"" movie took itself less seriously as it progressed ""Spider-Man"" is the opposite turning more violent downbeat and tedious as it goes along. Despite the kid-friendly beginning by the time the Goblin and Spider-Man pummel each other endlessly during the climax (the bridge setting borrowed from the Gwen Stacy death comic) the movie has earned its PG-13.With his big round soulful eyes Maguire always has been able to convey a sense of wonder and his instinct for understatement also serves him well here. His few off-notes come when the screenplay calls for Peter to be rude to his aunt and uncle.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesLook whos climbing the wallsApril 30 2002Take a spinSeptember 27 2004Spidey turns to the dark sideMay 3 2007This time musical makes some Spidey-senseJune 14 2011`Spider-Man packed with thrillsJanuary 16 2003Find More Stories AboutAmazing Spider-manGreen GoblinTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2002-05-03/entertainment/0205030417_1_green-goblin-amazing-spider-man-peter-parker,200,spider10,spider,chicagotribune

Unlike the hero of Kafkas great and unnerving story however the Queens teenager doesnt turn into an immense bug but an enhanced human endowed with the strength and physical gifts of a different species. He still looks like the films star Tobey Maguire but bigger. With tumescent biceps and flagstone stomach musculature he now moves like an arachnid scuttling up the sides of buildings volleying through the air and most usefully ejaculating long white streams of webbing from his wrists. As with every adolescent the live-action version of Marvels bug-boy has sticky fingers and a world of deeply repressed desires; he aches for the seemingly unobtainable having nursed dreams of becoming a photographer and snaring the girl next door Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Yet unlike Kafkas Gregor Samsa and every other kid on the block he can realize his dreams transform his sexual panic maybe even get the girl. Because unlike the rest of us Peter Parker has something special going for him -- a legacy as one of the coolest of modern comic-book creations a superhero who was closer in age to his fan base than most a hero as the original comic explained ""that could be you."" The thing is Spider-Man hasnt aged all that well. Theres that getup for starters a one-piece stretchy number which while appealingly form-fitted when combined with the characters slinky athleticism makes Spider-Man seem less like a superhero than a Cirque de Soleil acrobat on the cruise. His spider-ass bobs in the air like a buoy in stormy waters but is that really what were supposed to be thinking about when we watch Maguire (or his stunt double) flex his superhero moves? (And if that is what were meant to be thinking about then why is the spider-package as humble as that of a Ken doll?) Its hard to know what to think given how unsteadily director Sam Raimi has delivered his version of Stan Lee and Steve Ditkos creation into the 21st century. Like the characters themselves the tone of this blown-up comic continually wavers between low-key hip knowingness and plaintive sincerity without ever settling into a groove. Maguire isnt much of a geek even before the transforming spider bite though he wears Peters bafflement and outsider status easily enough. It helps that the actors voice sounds as if its only recently broken because there isnt much else going on here to convince us that Peter Parker is anywhere near as tortured as his opening narration asserts. And yeah hes got ""spider sense"" but in the age of manga and The Matrix who cares? It isnt that Spider-Man is inherently unsuited for live-action translation; its just that hes not particularly interesting or well animated. The costumes not just dorky (its a unitard) it actively subverts the characters complexity the human part of the superhero by putting one of the films strengths -- Maguires face -- completely under wraps every time some villain says boo. On the page a characters expression is subordinate to how expressively he or she fits into the panel; the exact tilt at which Batman clenches his fists or one of R. Crumbs balloon girls widens her mouth can be as revelatory as any movie close-up often more so. For a comic book to pop off the screen you need live-action images that can grab you as hard and fast as any graphic image -- and if the actors face and the action arent there to hook you then the films style had better. In his moody 1990 thriller Darkman Raimi didnt just fashion a poetics of despair out of his characters grief he found the visual language with which to express that pain (much as he did eight years later for A Simple Plan). If theres nothing personal about the look of this film its in part because here Raimi never dives into the dark or rolls about in the muck of the human condition. His New York locations are as deracinated as a backlot which wouldnt be bad if it served an aesthetic purpose rather than coming off as a sop to the PG-thirteens. The tinniness of the big action scenes is especially calamitous. Too much of the computer animation is hard to buy -- the difference between Maguires tensile grace and the crude smear of his digital avatar is striking -- and the action feels inorganic more out of obligation to the genre than a brute fact of Peter Parkers world. As Spider-Mans nemesis the Green Goblin Willem Dafoe is never scarier than when hes stretching his beautiful corpse lips into a smile. But put him in a shiny emerald carapace atop an aerial boogie-board sneering and tossing bombs like a one-man intifada and the guys a goof nowhere near as dangerous as Dunsts liberally exposed decolletage. Perhaps the real question then isnt how you update Spider-Man but why you would even try. Introduced in 1962 the original superhero helped to initiate the age of modern comics. Raimi hasnt figured out how to reconfigure him for the blockbuster age and there are suggestions -- from Dunsts chaste enthusiasm to the casting of James Dean look-alike James Franco as Peters friend Harry -- that the director would have preferred to set his story in a different era. By far the liveliest scenes are of Peters pleasure in his newly metamorphosed body as he indulges in the glories of his own youth and physical vibrancy. When he runs down the family stairway the morning after hes been bitten theres something in the moment that invites comparisons to Rebel Without a Cause even if this time the kids literally dancing across the walls not just climbing them.

SO THIS SHORT SKINNY guy with a face like a crumpled gym sock walks into a movie and asks ""Why did the old frog kiss the beautiful princess?"" After a beat the short skinny guy wrings his hands licks his lips and answers ""Because the beautiful princess was a dumb fuck."" That isnt remotely funny but neither is Hollywood Ending the new Woody Allen movie in which the frog prince of New York comedy again wallows in the middle of the frame as various familiar faces namely various princes and princesses from television dart about him like so many flies with a death wish. This time Allen plays Val Waxman a once-famous filmmaker whose former wife Ellie (Tea Leoni) now ensconced in Los Angeles at a topflight studio with a power boyfriend (Treat Williams) secures him a career-reviving directing gig. Val suffers from many of the Woodsters frequent complaints -- a beautiful ex an estranged son fawning friends and an equally sycophantic nitwit girlfriend (Debra Messing) -- although as usual everything seems to be going his way (including the movie itself a costly period piece that inexplicably hes being allowed to shoot in New York rather than on an L.A. back lot). In any event just before production begins Val succumbs to hysterical blindness which leaves him to bluff his way through production without benefit of sight. For those who have been watching most of Allens films since he canned his longtime director of photography Carlo Di Palma this may not sound all that far-fetched. Still while the writer-directors films have been nothing much to look at in the last couple of years it wasnt as if his last cinematographer Zhao Fei was bereft of talent as seems to be the case with his latest Wedigo von Schultzendorff. Not that Allen would notice. As his films look progressively worse and ring increasingly hollow it has become clear that the guy not only has no interest in making movies that are beautiful engaging meaningful or especially funny; he has no interest in making movies for audiences period. It isnt only that there is a dearth of ideas in Hollywood Ending -- however hateful Deconstructing Harry was at least about something -- its that the whole thing is almost entirely devoid of pleasure. This new feature -- with most of its gibes aimed at California Canada and pointedly Chinese cinematographers -- may be marginally more lively than the one before but thats only because this one runs longer and features George Hamilton who classes up his every scene. Allen no longer seems capable of suckering high-end talent such as Julia Roberts and Sean Penn into playing his onscreen patsies but a suavey like Hamilton is too professional to let someone elses career slump get in his way.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> To get the big news out fast Spider-Man is up up and away as the firecracker to beat this summer. Working from a script by David Koepp director Sam Raimi gives this unapologetic fluff a mind a heart and a keen sense of fun -- all the ingredients missing from say The Scorpion King. And the actors seem to be having almost as good a time as we are. The unlikely superhero that Stan Lee created at Marvel Comics in 1962 makes a perfect fit for Tobey Maguire. OK so maybe a stuntman squeezed into Spidey drag for the dangerous feats that arent CG (computer generated). Maguires substantial accomplishment isnt acrobatic; he builds a real character out of the sketch that is Peter Parker an orphan from Queens New York. Peter has a high school geeks sense of the universe Hes getting screwed out of the good stuff especially teen angel nextdoor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst taking adorable to a sexy new dimension). Supermans roots on another planet and Batmans wealth always kept those crusaders at a distance. Peter is the average joe incarnate. Even after that mutant spider bites him and he starts going bugfuck climbing walls Peter still cant make the move that would get him into Mary Janes pants. He feels resentful when his rich friend Harry (a brooding James Franco) horns in on her but says nothing. Peter is a product of the solid values instilled by his uncle (Cliff Robertson) and aunt (Rosemary Harris). Mary Janes father is abusive. And Harrys dad the scientist-mogul Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) ignores him while staging shouting matches with his villainous alter ego the Green Goblin. Dafoe is a wild warped wonder taking the Goblin to dark places the Joker never investigated.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Comic-book freaks will bitch about liberties taken. Youll hear that some of the CGI isnt so hot (it isnt) and that the Goblins mask looks like party plastic (it does). Know what? It doesnt matter. Raimi mixes his flair for the sensational (The Evil Dead) and the subtle (A Simple Plan) into one knockout package. Peter testing his new powers with small skips and jumps until he is leaping across rooftops is Raimis style in a nutshell slow build huge payoff. The cold technology of the FX like the Times Square battle between Spidey and the Goblin can freeze off feeling. Raimi counters by showing a New York crowd booing the Goblin with a moving post-9/11 fervor ""You mess with one of us you mess with all of us."" Its the little things that float this 139 million balloon. That includes the upside-down kiss when Mary Jane slowly pulls down Spideys mask for a smacker and nearly strips his face naked before he leaps away. Maguire and Dunst keep Spider-Man on a high with their sweet-sexy yearning spinning a web of dazzle and delicacy that might just restore the good name of movie escapism.

"Spider-Man | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; spider-man ) Spider-Man (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Recent times have been good to Marvel comics and the long-anticipated arrival of Spider-Man represents the latest step up the ladder. Long the underdog in the motion picture arena Marvel has at last been able to catch up to rival DC comics by placing a trio of its superheroes into multiplexes - Blade the X-Men and Spider-Man. DC may have struck first with Superman and Batman but these days the comics-to-cinema summit belongs to Stan Lees corporation. The second X-Men movie is on its way as are Daredevil The Hulk and a little farther into the future The Fantastic Four. Of all Marvels titles Spider-Man probably has the most name recognition due in no small part to the late 60s animated TV series that became a staple in syndication. There have been other Spider-Man TV cartoons and even a ill-advised foray into live-action television but the first series is probably the one best remembered by fans and casual viewers alike. Crude as the animation may have been nostalgia allows it to hold a firm place in cartoon history. A major motion picture adaptation has long been a pet project of Spideys creator Stan Lee (who along will illustrator Steve Ditko gave birth to the web-crawler in 1962). In the 90s James Cameron spent years developing the project but eventually gave up when legal issues held up production indefinitely. Eventually those tangles were loosened and Evil Dead director Sam Raimi was brought on board. Spider-Man is as critic-proof as movies come so nothing that I say will make even a miniscule difference but for what its worth this represents the best kind of summer movie - bold colorful and well-paced without numbing the mind or insulting the intelligence. On the scale of superhero movies this one is about on par with X-Men ahead of all of the Batman movies but behind the grandly reverent Superman. And like the first movie featuring the Man of Steel this one has a wide-open ending that invites - nay demands - a sequel. Barring an unexpected box-office disaster Spider-Man 2 is probably only a couple of years away. In comic book language this is an ""origin"" story meaning that it tells how Spider-Man came into being. The movie starts by introducing us to nerdy high school senior Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) who is one of the least cool kids in school. Hes shy and smart and the girl of his dreams Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) doesnt know he exists even though he has lived next door to her for more than 10 years. Peters best friend is Harry Osborn (James Franco) the underachieving son of the rich and arrogant scientist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Peter lives with his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and aunt May (Rosemary Harris) who are like a father and mother to him. Things change rapidly for Peter when while visiting a lab at Columbia University he is bitten by a genetically altered spider. Overnight Peter gains arachnid powers - a sixth sense the ability to climb walls unnatural strength and endurance amazing agility and glands on his wrist that allow him to spin webs. Eventually Peter is forced to make a choice between hiding his abilities and using them for personal gain or coming into the open and helping humanity. After choosing the latter and donning the red-and-blue costume Peter Parker gives way to Spider-Man. Meanwhile Spideys first arch-rival is also in the making as Norman Osborns scientific experimentation gives him equal parts superhuman strength and madness and his access to the latest technology allows him to don a horrific metal suit and ride a one-man jet-propelled glider. After his first public appearance at which he wreaks mayhem the press dubs him The Green Goblin. The first hour of Spider-Man is unquestionably better than the second. This is the segment of the film where Peter discovers his newfound powers and tentatively explores them. Covertly then with more confidence he stands up to the school bully. He also has to deal with his unrequited love for Mary Jane and cope with the responsibilities and consequences of using (or not using) his abilities. An exhilarating sequence in which Spider-Man first employs his webs to swing from building-to-building is filmed in such a manner that we can sense how close he is to losing control and plunging to the streets below. The latter half of the film is more action-oriented and features an excessive reliance upon special effects. The CGI work is not clumsily done but it is evident when the movie switches from live actors to computer-generated ones. Peter Parker has a lot of appeal and emotional depth. Those qualities do not always remain in force once the mask is donned. Although it is first and foremost an action/adventure film Spider-Man is many other things as well. Theres a fairly high romance quotient - after all many of Peters motivations are centered around his near-obsession with Mary Jane. These two make a cute couple but the better part of their love story is still to come (although their kiss with Spider-Man hanging upside down as they lock lips is memorable). Spider-Man also offers occasional doses of morality the biggest one coming from Uncle Bens words of warning to Peter ""With great power comes great responsibility."" In the comic book that phrase became Spider-Mans credo. Spider-Mans greatest strength is Tobey Maguire. The Cider House Rules actor who has never given a bad performance is an inspired choice for the role. Not only is he capable of handling the role of nerdy Peter but he has bulked up enough that he looks good under the spider-suit (that is when its him under it). Maguire never overacts the part nor does he view this as camp. Its a quiet serious performance and it doesnt take us long to believe in Peter. And when tragedy strikes its genuinely moving. Added to that Maguire can make some extremely dopey lines of dialogue sound convincing. With this everyman interpretation Maguire shows us what could have been with Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader but never was. Speaking of Batman one of the key flaws in that film was the way Jack Nicholsons mugging for the camera overwhelmed everything. Such is not the case here. Sure Willem Dafoe overacts but not to the point where its embarrassing and he isnt given enough screen time to overshadow Peters story. Dafoes performance is occasionally chilling but in the end its not especially memorable. As the films love interest Kirsten Dunst is moderately appealing but other than being saved from death A! lA  Lois Lane she doesnt have much to do. In supporting parts are a somewhat stiff James Franco as Harry J.K. Simmons as newspaperman J. Jonah Jameson and veterans Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Peters guardians. Raimis direction is solid although not as involving as it was in the Evil Dead movies or his other superhero yarn Darkman. He avoids an overabundance of trickery but chooses his shots in a way that often gives us the sense of being on a journey with Spider-Man rather than standing to the side as detached observers. The special effects may not be entirely convincing but they do not eclipse the characters. Danny Elmans score is workmanlike and somewhat reminiscent of the music he composed for Batman. Spider-Man gets the 2002 summer movie season off to a satisfying start. This is a pure popcorn movie - the kind of film one can unabashedly enjoy for what it is. Theres plenty of visual flash and dizzying action but not at the expense of the other qualities that make for a complete motion picture experience. As a character in a comic book Spider-Man is four decades old. His leap into this new medium has rejuvenated the legend and offers movie-goers an opportunity to sit back and enjoy the birth of a new cinematic superhero.

"Spider-Mans World Wide Web washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Spider-Mans World Wide Web Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 3 2002 I DONT like to use the c-word in a family newspaper. It embarrasses me my editors my family and most of all our beloved Weekend readers. But with ""Spider-Man"" Ive got no choice. The movie is cute. Yes my friends. Cute as a button. Cute as two buttons especially when you consider uber-blue-eyed Tobey Maguire who plays Spidey and Kirsten Dunst whos the sweet adorable gal next-door Mary Jane ""MJ"" Watson. This movie is all about Maguires infectious grin and Dunsts ravishingly innocent gaze. Instead of rooting for Spider-Man to save humankind from evil and to revenge the death of his uncle (Cliff Robertson) you simply want these two endearing kids to get together. Anyone whos coming to see ""Batman"" all over again is going to be disappointed. Sure youll get the Stan Lee business. (The Great Originator Stan Lee is an exec producer by the way.) You know what I mean by that Superhero mustnt let his bad side take the upper hand. Also because of his duty to God and country (well New York City anyway) he can never reveal his identity or his love to the woman of his dreams. But theres much less gothic edginess than youd expect even though composer Danny (""Batman"") Elfman occasionally seems to be trying to evoke Gotham Citys Caped Crusader. And the computer-generated imagery (which nowadays we have to evaluate like a character unto itself) is playful and cartoonish rather than awesome and overwhelming. This is all to the good. ""Spider-Man"" has to weave its own web. And weave it does. David Koepps script examines the curse of being a superhero. But he does it almost dutifully. What really rocks his word processor is Spider-Mans awesome ability to ricochet from building to building. What fun it is to be a superhero Underneath the bubbly fun the movies strongest element is Spider-Man/Peter Parkers desperate yearning for MJ whose untapped sexuality (particularly in one rain-drenched scene) is only just kept under wraps. Good-natured nerd Parker who lives with his uncle and aunt (Robertson and Rosemary Harris) has a crush on classmate Mary Jane. On a school trip to see a science demonstration of arachnids a genetically altered ""super spider"" bites Peter. He feels sick goes straight to bed. He wakes up with a big lump on his hand where he was bitten. But thats not all. He doesnt need to wear glasses anymore. Suddenly hes ripped. Hes got gymnastic reflexes that Jackie Chan and the folks in ""The Matrix"" would die for. And hes got this sticky ability to shoot tough web strands out of his wrists. Forget Tarzans creepers. Spider-Man can swing across Manhattan faster than anyone. In the meantime manic businessman Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is working on a formula that would make supermen out of soldiers. When his backers show no confidence he decides to try the formula on himself. It works only too well. And when hes kicked out of his own weaponsmaking corporation by the board of directors he gets really mad at well everyone. Now hes the Green Goblin hellbent on the usual mayhem. Dafoes Green Goblin is more amusing than threatening. Oh sure hes got devastating power bombs that can turn people into instant skeletons. But hes almost (sorry) cute as he flies around on his futuristic airborne surfboard. Hes so laid-back that when he captures Spider-Man on one occasion he doesnt even lift the superheros mask to find out who he is. With sociopaths like this who needs easygoing people? And with disarmingly entertaining movies like this dare I say who needs big bad superhero movies? SPIDER-MAN (PG-13 121 minutes) - Contains violence that is inappropriate for young children.

"Itsy-Bitsy No More washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Itsy-Bitsy No More Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 3 2002 You will believe a man can swing. Thats ""Spider-Man"" an exuberance a celebration a hoot a kick and a half. What it gets most and best - as did the original ""Superman"" of lo those many years ago - is the sheer joy of movement in defiance of gravity both literally and as metaphor. This daring young man flies through the air with the greatest of ease followed everywhere by a camera and an audience. The fabled skyscrapers and bridges of New York are but fulcrums for a teen acrobat created by an accidental helping of arachnid DNA as he rides his gossamer cables up and down the air currents at speeds that are unbelievable. So advanced is the technology that the film in some ways appears to be an ESPN documentary on the new sport of urban bungee slalom. (Kids dont try this at home unless you have access to a high-tech hard drive and a 50 mil FX budget.) But as vivid an illusion of the swinging lifestyle as this is what it means is more vivid It is the most yearned-for of adolescent needs resonant and poignant at once denied by society parents peers civilization even - freedom of the self. The ego unrestrained the me-ness of me made omnipotent and ceaseless. It cant happen of course but a certain never-vanished instinct longs for it and ""Spider-Man"" which like all superhero stories is a manifestation of this urge somehow captures its essence. Partly thats because of the brilliance of the original concept. Peter Parker as invented by the geniuses at Marvel Comics was never Clark Kent; he wasnt an aristocrat from outer space raised in small-town Midwestern paradise thus combining two ancient American archetypes of purity. He was more a Woody Allen figure a New York nebbish the loner who wasnt in the cool set and had an uncertain way about him. The accidental bite of some genetically diddled super-spider in a college lab causes him to grow eight legs all of them hairy. Well figuratively It gives him the strength the courage the reflexes the instincts and the web-furling abilities of the eight-legged. And also a fondness for red and blue latex bodysuits as a fashion statement. That process - the origin of the species as it were - is chronicled in the first half of the movie. Tobey Maguire hardly the most prepossessing of actors has two things going for him. First and best he is not Elijah Wood. Second hes one of those quiet presences who grow on you. You dont find him dominating; hes not one to attract attention to himself and with his squeaky voice (Maguire is 26; if his voice ever changes hell be unemployable) spindly frame and wan almost dead eyes hes not particularly charismatic. In fact the movies other boys - James Franco and Joe Manganiello as respectively a mopey friend and a brutal adversary - seem more interesting at first. Maguires Parker who truly looks all of 17 is the scorn-object of his high school class his love for next-door babe Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst whos never looked hotter) completely unrequited. The movie follows the class on a field trip to Columbias arachnid department - those are big in the Ivies you know - where the fateful bite gets bitten. Pete goes to bed feeling cruddy and awakens feeling super. As in Superman. No he doesnt fly under his own magic propulsion but he has picked up the attributes of the super-spiders and the movie goes into reverie as Pete begins to explore his new powers quash those whove quashed him and quietly figure out what this new spider thing is. Suddenly he has a destiny. Meanwhile - it does take a bit of while for everything to mesh - the story proper is assembling itself as industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is losing his empire when a defense contract for some kind of performance enhancer falls behind schedule. So he experiments with it and the stuff turns him instantly into a cackling cartoon figure called the Green Goblin by the tabloid papers whose plastic mask is a re-creation of Willem Dafoes already stylized face as a Kabuki demon. Throw in a jet-powered anti-gravity surfboard that has more maneuverability and flexibility than poor Spider-Mans web rides and suddenly the Green Goblin with his agenda of revenge control mischief and humiliation is an appropriately sized opponent for our hero. Dafoe has always been something of a caricature with that cadaverous face that scrawny if muscled body those intense baby-blues. But as similar roles did for Gene Hackman in ""Superman"" and Jack Nicholson in ""Batman"" this role liberates him. Hes terrific. Leering laughing fiendishly giddy with power and evil he surfs through New York looking for a fight. Yes theres a plot that justifies all this but its hardly worth recounting. Its really just a platform to set up midair Midtown smackdowns between Spidey and Goblin while the whole world watches. These battles are terrific and the director funster Sam Raimi (he does super well - remember his ""Darkman""?) has great fun in the can-you-top-this school of extravagant actioneering. I think the movie falters in its last tete-a-tete between these two epic figures just as I thought it faltered in taking too long to get to them. The last faceoff becomes a punch-out thats both overly intimate and overly violent. It feels unsavory next to the aerial shenanigans weve seen. But the movies signal brilliance is not its gigantism its the way in which the clever script and the grounded acting keep it firmly rooted in an adolescents world. Though his alter ego is Spider-Man Pete remains well a nebbish. Hes still a scorn-object hes still unsure around girls and friends hes still passive when confronted with a more complex and powerful world. Hes a superhero who remembers what it was like before he was super or heroic. That gives the movie a kind of poignancy rare for this sort of big-budget lollapaloozing flamboyance and makes it the last thing youd ever expect touching. SPIDER-MAN (PG-13 121 minutes) - Contains bloodless but intense and fatal violence. At area theaters.

Starring Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe. Directed by Sam Raimi. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 121 minutes.) ""Spider-Man"" based on the Marvel Comics series is about a melancholy superhero who can climb buildings throw webs from his fingertips and swing through cities but cant get it together in his personal life. The summer blockbuster directed by Sam Raimi is a serviceable adaptation with some inspired casting in the choice of Tobey Maguire in the title role and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane the heros romantic obsession. The human side of the story works well -- clearly lots of thought and feeling went into developing it. But the superhero part of the movie will leave audiences with a flat feeling thanks to computery-looking special effects and a sagging story line. The big advantage of Maguire is his naked sensitivity which makes him instantly likable. He plays Peter Parker a high school nerd in love with the girl next door MJ (Dunst) but he cant find the nerve to speak to her. In a sense hes every young man until the fateful day when he is bitten by a genetically altered spider. Within hours he is exhibiting the special powers that will turn him into a superhero. But Peter is not only passive in his pursuit of MJ hes also largely reactive in his battle against the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) a homicidal maniac who rides through New York on a surfboard-like glider shooting missiles and lobbing bombs while laughing like a jackal. Their clash takes up most of the movie but Dafoe not Maguire dominates their scenes. The Goblin decides when to fight and how to fight while Spider- Man can only play catch-up. Their clash is disappointing in yet another way. When Spider-Man swings on vines of web matter he looks like a little bouncing image on a computer screen. Likewise the sight of the Green Goblin riding a glider looks like something out of a video game. Ten years ago these scenes might have been something but audiences today expect more. By the middle of the movie the action scenes are dominating. Peter doesnt want to fight the audience wishes he didnt have to and the whole thing feels dispiriting. . -- This film contains violence.

Raimi made the terrific Darkman in 1990 a stylish moody tale of unexpected depth that was everything the Batman movies shouldve been. Raimi conceived the Darkman story himself but it captured the spirit of comic-book superheroes far better than any of the big-budget behemoths based on actual comics. He brings the same energy and visual flare to Spider-Man at least in the beginning. But just as comic-book heroes have alter egos the movie makes its own identity switch halfway through. It starts as a nimble spirited tale that adroitly captures the flavor of Spider-Man comics particularly during the early years when it was written by Stan Lee and drawn by Steve Ditko. The film even duplicates classic poses and the comics sense of humor. But then it gets weighted down by the lugubrious trappings of big-budget fantasy movies. For long stretches it doesnt even feel like Spider-Man. Like the first Superman and Batman movies this is an origin tale. It tells how nerdy Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a genetically altered spider that endows him with spiderlike abilities. The movie escapes the perfunctory feel of those other origin stories however because it focuses on character. The genius of Marvel Comics and the quality that made Spider-Man such an enduring hero is that Parker had the same sort of problems as his readers. He was shy and socially awkward particularly around the girl he secretly loves Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He also had other complicated relationships and an insufferable boss. Superman was always Superman -- Clark Kent was just a ruse -- but Spider-Man could never be anything other than a masked Peter Parker with more abilities. His problems didnt go away. Some of them became more complicated. The movie has all the web-swinging special effects and super battles that anybody would want but the tale is anchored by Peters transformation which is emotional as well as physical. We watch as he develops a moral sense. He doesnt just become a superhero; he becomes a man. The death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) who raised him with Aunt May and Peters resulting sense of guilt influence this deeper transformation. Simultaneous with this evolution is the development of the storys supervillain the Green Goblin which occurs when a desperate research scientist (Willem Dafoe) tries out his new ""performance enhancer"" on himself. The Goblins costume differs from that of the character in the comic books. He wears armor and a metal face mask that unfortunately calls to mind Darth Vader. The battle between good and evil that goes on inside his head is objectified in one scene by the scientist conversing with the mask. It might remind viewers of Luke Skywalkers struggle to resist the dark side but because its Dafoe who starred in The Last Temptation of Christ it also feels like a camp version of Jesus temptation scene from that film. At another point -- perhaps the silliest moment in a movie that becomes progressively sillier as it goes on -- he has a conversation with his reflection in a mirror. As a representation of schizophrenia its even more laughable than Russell Crowes noirish spy-movie fantasy and gun battle in A Beautiful Mind. Maguire is a surprisingly effective Peter/Spider-Man. My first choice for the role wouldve been Ed Norton partly because he resembles Ditkos conception of Peter. Within seconds however it becomes hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Without the magic of computer-generated images this would be a different movie. Much of Spider-Mans web-swinging and acrobatics is done with digital animations -- cartoons in other words. Its exhilarating to watch him soar and swing between skyscrapers but too often the way he moves looks cartoonish which is jarring because of the visual naturalism of the rest of the movie. After an early period when Peter isnt sure what to do with his powers he decides to become a force for good foiling robberies rescuing babies from burning buildings and the like. But when the Green Goblin enters the picture he has a foe thats clearly more than his match. The Goblin rides on a weapon-equipped device thats like a cross between a magic carpet and a scooter. He also has an array of death-dealing grenades and other weapons. Lapses in logic pile up as the movie goes on. One is the way the Goblin clearly should be able to squash Spidey like a bug but never does. Another is the way characters interact with Spider-Man and the Green Goblin when theyre both in and out of costume and never recognize their voices or notice incongruities that would give away their identities. And there is a gratuitous scene near the end that seeks to honor New York after the attacks of Sept. 11 but feels like pandering. It shouldnt have been included but there is much in the second half that shouldve been left on the cutting-room floor. Its disheartening to watch the life drain out of the movie with every passing second.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday May 03 2002 1200AM EDT Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 1217AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Spider-Man Directed by Sam Raimi Written by David Koepp Staring Tobey Maguire Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe Classification PG Rating  The big-screen arrival of the 40-year-old Marvel Comic hero Spider-Man brings pleasure back to New Yorks skyscrapers as the webbed acrobat turns a stylized Manhattan into a supersized jungle gym swinging and twirling through the high-rise alleys. The movies final image as the red and blue figure spins on twin strands between buildings high above the street is not so much a memorable movie ending but the launch of a new New York movie franchise. Though Spider-Man comes with a huge budget in excess of 130-million (U.S.) the money is spent on taking viewers into its world more than blowing them away. Director Sam Raimi ( The Evil Dead A Simple Plan) is not aiming to out-flash Richard Donners myth-laden Superman movie or to out-art design Tim Burtons expressionist Batman but to create the warmth of a reel-to-reel comic book. The result has its pluses and minuses. The action swings between the comics more intimate frames and radical geometric perspectives but to its credit focuses mainly on the warm-hearted human tale of the innocent superhero in a hard world rather than on visual dazzle. On the downside the inevitable climactic standoffs between comic-book hero and villain feel more like a matter of formulaic necessity than imaginative inspiration. David Koepps screenplay (based on Stan Lee and Steve Ditkos Marvel Comic series) moves surely and briskly through the movies first half to weave the improbable into a backdrop of the plausible. The time frame is nebulous. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is an aspiring photographer who works for tabloid-newspaper editor Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). The editor is straight out of a 1940s screwball comedy yet talks about ""Julia Roberts in a thong."" Similarly this is an era when the New York borough of Queens represents small-town values yet corporate genetic-engineering experiments are threatening the safety of the human race. The first hour is a sweet and playful series of discoveries and it utterly validates the casting of the gently spacey Tobey Maguire ( The Wonder Boys The Cider House Rules) in the pivotal role. Hes a specialist in lonely characters with troubled secret lives. Parker is an orphan who lives with his kindly working-class uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). Parker carries a torch for his next-door neighbour the red-haired Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) a popular girl with a dark secret -- an abusive father. For reasons that are flimsy -- beyond his ingratiatingly nervous smile thick glasses and intellectual superiority -- Peter is such a reject at school that even the other rejects avoid him. Then comes the class field trip when a genetically altered spider happens to drop on his arm and bite him. Parker goes home feeling ill and wakes the next morning with magically improved vision a buff body and a whole new set of skills all of which instantly delight rather than terrify him. Maguire is best at these moments of physical play as the bashful hero practises his web-throwing techniques discovers he can climb walls with his sticky fingers and make a fool of the school bully with his arachnoid athleticism. When he still cant impress M.J. he decides to enter a wrestling contest to earn money for a used car. Theres an almost too brief comic display of his prowess (in a comically baggy proto-Spider-Man costume that looks like tie-dyed pajamas) in a caged battle against a goliath. High on his new strength and M.Js increasing interest Peters skyscraper swinging is the flight of a boy in love. When he comes crashing down -- to discover that hes partly responsible for letting his uncle be fatally wounded -- Spider-Kid turns into Spider-Man. Meanwhile the melodramatic wheels start to grind bringing the movie down to a more ordinary comic-book formula through its final two acts. Peters best friend in school is Harry (James Franco) son of scientist and multimillionaire Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Osborn Sr. is kindly disposed to the bright young Parker but his affable front hides a rapacious ambition. Desperate to win a major government contract he is engaging in some genetic experiments. Ignoring an assistant who warns that ""aggression violence and insanity"" are possible side effects of his new human-enhancement potion Osborn downs a dose. Dafoe makes for a dandy leering gentleman adding more than a hint of vampire campiness to his aristocratic villain. After drinking the potion hes apparently possessed by a demonic alter-ego (dubbed ""Green Goblin"" by Peters newspaper boss) who wears green armour spins around Manhattan on a jerky flying skateboard and tosses exploding mechanical pumpkins at his enemies. Instead of ravishing mid-air battle scenes audiences get a villain zooming around rooftops like a hopped-up watering can. At that point Spider-Man looks like just another expensive superhero movie. Much better are scenes where the action comes down to city streets where M.J. now slinging food in a greasy spoon while striving to be an actress finds herself in the cruel randomly violent world of New York. Each time disaster seems near her superhero stalker drops in throws some webbing around and makes things right. Though not able to deliver stock lines with the freshness Maguire can muster Dunst serves as an interesting contrast -- brittle and direct compared to Maguires dreamy diffusiveness. Naturally shes the sexual aggressor here (because all superheroes are chaste) and theres a particular upside-down half-masked kiss that instantly becomes one of movie historys more memorable smooches. Its the kiss to send any teenaged boy on a spinning high as well as launching the new age of arachnophilia.

Running time 121 minutes. Rated PG-13 (occasionally brutal violence). At the E-Walk the Chelsea the Kips Bay others. ---------- THE inspired casting of Tobey Maguire and the filmmakers intelligent fidelity to the most appealing aspects of the original Marvel Comics character ensure that ""Spider-Man"" is a surprisingly charming and even witty match for the best of Hollywoods comic-book adaptations. Director Sam Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp take the risk of letting a bittersweet teen romance loom almost as large in the story line as the lead characters crime-fighting struggles - and it pays off. There are plenty of corny moments but the level of camp is never allowed to overwhelm either the romance or the adventure. And with its alienated teenage hero there are times when ""Spider-Man"" seems to aspire to the profound darkness of the Frank Miller graphic novels that formed the basis of Tim Burtons ""Batman."" Orphan Peter Parker (Maguire) is a high school science geek with an unrequited crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the popular but good-hearted beauty who lives - where else? - next door. During a school field trip Peter is bitten by a genetically-engineered super-spider. (Back in 1962 when the original character was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko the scientific bogey was radiation.) The next day he wakes up with among other things better vision a muscular physique and a sixth ""spider sense"" that warns him of imminent danger. Remarkably unsurprised by Peters victory against the class bully in a school fight Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) warns Peter that ""with great power comes great responsibility."" But it takes a tragic error of judgment before Peter even begins to understand what this warning means - and embarks on a career as an acrobatic crimefighter swinging between the skyscrapers. No sooner does he take on this new role than he is confronted by a deadly enemy the Green Goblin - millionaire scientist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) made mad and strong by an experimental formula. Helmer Raimi whose style is more subdued here than in his other cult favorites like ""Army of Darkness"" makes the most of computer-generated acrobatic effects without letting them overwhelm the human relationships Dafoe does his best villain since ""Streets of Fire"" making up for the occasional over-the-top cackle with some impressively acted scenes in which Osborn confronts his own psychotic evil side. The wonderful Kirsten Dunst whose trademark unguardedness and slightly sullen sexiness are on full display beneath a red dye job is as appealing as ever. And though his career has been limited by his odd looks and narrow range its hard to imagine anyone else being as perfect a Peter Parker - intelligent shy but determined - as Tobey Maguire. Still it is J.K. Simmons best known as the fearsome Nazi inmate Schillinger in TVs ""Oz"" who steals the picture with his hyperactive performance as tabloid newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson. The tired dialogue in the family scenes is sometimes almost too cheesy to bear and theres some annoying product placement. The movie earns its PG-13 rating with some goreless but nevertheless brutal violence in the climactic battle and with the near-nudity of Dunsts first wet tank-top scene.

Send your answers along with your name age city state and a phone number where you can be reached on Sunday to Lifemoviesusatoday.com Boasting casting prowess to rival 1978s opening Superman salvo with Christopher Reeve this Marvel marvel looks at another roving rescuer whose more mundane ""self"" isnt at ease with a heros mission. He is the brilliant but socially maladroit high schooler Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) bitten to torso-enhancing extremes by a genetically altered spider during a museum field trip. Also on the outing is popular Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) a literal ""girl next door"" whose alcoholic father verbally abuses her. Even without his new powers the oddly disinclined Peter probably could flag her attention away from his better-looking and less-studious buddy (James Franco who earned his brooding stripes as James Dean on a TNT biopic). But he has webs to spin. And just to show that this is the rare cartoon adaptation in which every lead can be dysfunctional check out Willem Dafoe as Francos corporate-scientist pop. Transformed during a lab catastrophe into a marauding terror (Green Goblin) he too has a dual personality even more in conflict with itself. Somehow through all this the movie has a rapidly beating heart though two hours of near-constant frenzy may find you as winded as both adversaries by the end. You want thrills? The itinerant Spider-Man annihilates a burly pro wrestler for money in a stylish early scene and later bounces like a pinball from skyscraper to skyscraper rescuing victims (often the Goblins) after hitting his career stride. Production design? By imaginatively scrambling New York sites into something that almost looks like the city it deserves an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast (Cliff Robertson Rosemary Harris J.K. Simmons) is as perfect as the leads and theres even a truly seductive Maguire-Dunst kiss that will easily make the cut if the American Film Institute ever picks historys hundred best. The movies limitations are mostly built-in Heres one more big-screen comic book when comic books are what we now get at the movies every summer regardless of their subject. But you know a movie has succeeded when youre looking toward the sequel that Spider-Mans wrap-up strongly portends. This is a rare twisted crowd-pleaser for longtime fans as well as novices -- or for those that dont know an arachnid from an insect.

Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News The first ""Spider-Man"" comics by Stan Lee Steve Ditko and Jack Kirby had a modest quotidian feel. The simple plots and familiar settings -- high school home the big city -- seemed especially suited to the story of a nerd who thanks to a bite from a radioactive spider gains superpowers and becomes the web-slinging crime fighter. Thats the tone the new ""Spider-Man"" directed by Sam Raimi from a script by David Koepp aims to replicate. Theres nothing in ""Spider-Man"" to match the delirious Wagnerian grandeur of Tim Burtons ""Batman"" or the hard gleaming surfaces and combination of melancholic undertow and propulsive motion that suited ""X-Men"" so well. Raimi doesnt try to transcend the material or give it a large-scale operatic lushness. Set in Queens where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Manhattan where he works as a photographer for the Daily Bugle and swings from skyscraper to skyscraper in his guise as Spider-Man the movie serves its source material. Episodically told the picture isnt especially thrilling and its moments of visual glory are less than you might want. What holds the movie together is its modest sweet spirit. Its easy to forgive the flaws in a big-budget comic-book blockbuster when the picture displays the affection and decency (toward its characters as well as the audience) that ""Spider-Man"" does. Raimi isnt out to bash us over the head and he directs action sequences so you can actually tell whats going on in them (whereas most contemporary action movies are visual gibberish). If ""Spider-Man"" isnt the dark dazzler other directors have achieved in comic book movies its also not a cheat. ""Spider-Man"" is a movie made by honorable people who want to do good work (as opposed to a pretext for merchandising tie-ins) and theres nothing crass or cynical about the ways in which it falls short. The biggest thing ""Spider-Man"" has going for it is the charm of its two young leads Maguire and Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane the girl next door whom Peter has pined for since they were kids. Reportedly Raimi had to fight the studio to cast Maguire who wasnt their idea of an action hero. It would be sheer foolishness to expect studio execs to actually know something about the movie they were financing and Maguire is a perfect piece of casting. The Peter Parker of the comics is a slight bespectacled bookworm picked on by the other kids and a dutiful nephew to the aunt and uncle who raised him. Peter is the opposite of Superman who in the guise of Clark Kent was a suave man playing a wimp (the quality that Christopher Reeve with his ace timing caught so well). Peter really is a wimp. Being Spider-Man allows him to live out his fantasies of being cool; it puts him in tune with his inner wiseass. Casting a musclebound conventionally good-looking stud in the role would have canceled that tension and given the audience no reason to root for him. Maguire who behind his perpetually dazed expression understands how to play sly comedy wins us over immediately. Hes like the 98-pound weakling who got sand kicked in his face in those old comic-book ads only with a canny ironic sense of his newfound powers. Maguire uses that weird curved smile of his (it always seems to start on one side of his mouth and slowly spread to the rest of his face) to convey the pleasure of a science whiz seeing an experiment go spectacularly right. His big blue unblinking eyes seem to open wider when there are more wonders to take in. Koepp and Raimi do some sly comedy of their own in the scenes where Peter tries to get his web-spinning abilities under control. The gummy white fluid that shoots out of his wrists becomes a metaphor for the other thing that teenage boys often cant control. And Koepp has provided Maguire with some dandy repartee as Peter invokes every superhero slogan he can remember (""Sha-zam"" and so on) to take charge of the webs as they fire wide of their target. One of the things that makes Spider-Man difficult for an actor is that unlike Superman or the X-Men or even Batman his entire face is hidden behind a mask. Wisely Raimi and Koepp keep those scenes brief. When Maguire is in costume he uses that peculiar voice of his something of a high lilting croak a voice that seems to find each joke in the course of telling it to remind us of the guy underneath. In the climax when Spideys mask is half torn off we get to see both that unblinking weblike visage and Peters own scared countenance side by side. Its an elegant little visual metaphor for the divisions in the character. Maguire does some wonderful physical work. When we first see Peter shinny up a wall he affects a creepy-crawly contortionism that suggests something not quite human. And hes possessed of his own loopy ardor. The moment where he declares his feelings to Mary Jane fixing her with those blue peepers feels like it comes out in a single breath and yet isnt rushed. It has the enticing and slightly unsettling romanticism of someone ushering his loved one into his rich fantasy life. Mary Jane is probably the sexiest sassiest girlfriend any superhero has ever had. Dunst might have seemed too sunshiny for the role (though that quality is also the source of her best comic performances). In red hair and tight clingy tops Dunst puts the open sexuality she showed in last years ""Crazy/Beautiful"" to new uses. Shes like a teen version of the wisecracking dames who inhabited 30s comedy. This girl knows the score. Shes a natural cutup Mary Jane preens and poses as Peter snaps photos of her pretending to be fascinated by a science exhibit. And without warning she can suddenly go deep and quiet as those bright eyes cloud over and her buried emotions come to the surface. You Might Also Like Dunst and Maguire have a lovely quiet scene while talking in their adjoining backyards at night that captures the rapport between them without forcing a thing. And they have the movies single best moment After Spidey has rescued Mary Jane from a pack of muggers he hangs upside down into the rain-soaked alley as she peels the lower half of his mask back for a lingering kiss. Its a moment of dark enchantment and you wish the filmmakers had ventured deeper into that spirit of potent eroticism. One of the reasons the movie feels a little pokey is that it doesnt seamlessly meld the story of Peter exulting in his new role with the plotline of his fighting the movies main villain the Green Goblin. Thats the role played by Willem Dafoe as the tycoon scientist Norman Osborn who is changed by one of his own experiments into an evildoer bent on -- what else? -- dominating the big city. (The character is also the father of Peters best friend played by James Franco who the movie leads us to believe will play an important role in the sequel.) Dafoes Green Goblin get-up a piece of metal body armor unfortunately includes a motionless mask that hides his face. Luckily Koepp has provided Dafoe with a spectacular scene where Osborn staring in a mirror has a conversation as himself and as the Goblin. Its beautifully staged and shot. Its also perhaps the single best piece of screen work Dafoe has ever done. He makes the Jekyll-and-Hyde transitions on a dime so crystal clear that you actually see him shift personas. The script could have allowed more of Osborn fighting with the evil persona that has taken him over but Dafoe works to distill all of it in that one sequence. (Unlike many big-budget action pictures ""Spider-Man"" actually has a script. Koepp writes good dialogue for the characters with just enough curlicues to keep it from sounding comic-book flat or comic-book campy.) Theres also a terrific supporting performance from J.K. Simmons (who plays the shrink on ""Law amp; Order"") as Daily Bugle publisher J. Jonah Jameson whos out to prove Spider-Man is a menace. In a salt-and-pepper whiffle and big mustache Simmons looks so much like the Jameson from the Spider-Man comic that the audience bursts into laughs when it first lays eyes on him. Simmons keeps the laughs coming chewing his scenes like the fat stogie Jameson keeps stuck in his cake-hole. ""Spider-Man"" is a considerably better piece of direction than Raimis last comic-book outing ""Darkman."" He uses the Queens and Manhattan settings to ground the movie in a recognizable reality. And though the CGI effects are disappointing (looking both hyperreal and inevitably fake) the first sequence of Spider-Man swinging through the canyons of New York is nicely done. It gives you a sense of the passing landscape as Spidey sees it out of the corners of his eyes as he swoops and rises straining to get into rhythm. (If sailors find their sea legs what do web-slingers find? Their air legs?) There are also little jokes that catch the corner of your eye -- like the Terminix billboard during a Times Square showdown between Spider-Man and the Goblin. While the cinematography by Don Burgess is merely serviceable there is one indelible image Mary Jane and a cable car full of kids each reflected in the eyes of Spider-Mans mask as he must choose whom to save as each plummets toward the water below. The main problem with Raimis direction is that he doesnt think big enough. You want him to whip the material up into a heroic froth to be caught up in something grand and dark and crazy and he sticks stubbornly to the small comic-book scale. He doesnt even work up the panache for what should be the movies comic-emotional high point the scene where crowds of New Yorkers turn up to cheer on Spider-Man and pelt the Goblin with refuse. You cant quite believe what youre seeing in that moment Koepp has had the daring (and the heart) to come up with a comic-book version of the solidarity the city showed last fall. Halfhearted as the staging is the generous daring of it makes you laugh with pleasure. Perhaps Raimi didnt feel he could work on a bigger scale and keep his eyes on the characters. If thats the case he made the right choice. Ill take good characters you care about over whiz-bangery any day. But maybe the almost certain success of this movie will give him the courage to take chances in the next one. Often the second installments of pop-movie franchises like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Superman II"" have been the best in the series. Its nice to be able to say that ""Spider-Man"" unlike so many big-budget summer movies doesnt wear out its welcome. Charles Taylor is a columnist for the Newark Star-Ledger. More Charles Taylor.

"The Spider and the Fly Girl - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsThe Spider and the Fly GirlSpider-Man has a surprising and satisfying romance angle and yet the film still manages to be a solidly crafted comic-book adventure.May 03 2002|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES STAFF WRITER ""Spider-Man"" may look like an action comic come to life but its best feature is its romance comic heart. Its that rare cartoon movie in which the villain is less involving than the love story.Like any celebrity biography ""Spider-Man"" is more interesting when its subject is struggling than after he succeeds--and of Spider-Mans renown there can be no doubt. Uncommonly popular since his comic-book creation by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko some 40 years ago Spidey was conceived as a new kind of hero very much a teenager with age-specific uncertainties and anxieties that having unusual powers did nothing to ease. But let Peter Parker Spider-Mans alter ego tell you himself in the voice-over that starts the film""Who am I? You sure you wanna know? The story of my life is not for the faint of heart. If somebody said it was a happy little tale if somebody told you I was just your average ordinary guy not a care in the world ... somebody lied.""Director Sam Raimi a long-time ""Spider-Man"" fan was once known for mainlining the kind of murky midnight sensibility that Tim Burton brought to the ""Batman"" films. Though hes used Burtons composer Danny Elfman Raimis tone here is distinctly sunny. And though his ""Spider-Man"" marks time more than it needs to and is no more than sporadically exhilarating it does enough things right to be a solid comic-book citizen.The key thing Raimi did right was insist on Tobey Maguire (""Wonder Boys"" ""The Cider House Rules"") for the title character. Though he convincingly trained and bulked up for the role Maguire will never be the traditional hunk that studios prefer in these kinds of parts. But the appropriateness of his creaky-voiced sincerity the very ordinariness of his offbeat charisma turns him into the most convincing of Spider-Men.Before there was a Spider-Man there was Peter Parker a senior at Midtown High School in Queens N.Y. whos so nerdy even the school bus driver wants nothing to do with him. An orphan who lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) Peter has pined for the lovely girl next door Mary Jane Watson (a red-headed Kirsten Dunst) ever since he was 6. A lot of good thats done him.Peter has only one friend and fellow outcast Harry Osborn (James Franco of TVs ""James Dean"") the son of the fabulously wealthy Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) a man whose expertise in nanotechnology has made his company Oscorp a key supplier of advanced weapons to the Pentagon.One fateful day Peter accompanies his class on a field trip to the science departments of Columbia University. As photographer for the school paper Peter is concentrating on a shot of Mary Jane when a rare genetically designed super-spider takes a healthy bite out of him.By the next morning Peter is a different person. His body is buff he doesnt need his glasses and he has reflexes ordinary humans cant even imagine. Uncle Ben thinks its just raging hormones but we know better. We know that Spider-Man has been born.If these intentionally dopey interactions with Aunt May and Uncle Ben are the films weakest links its strengths are the sequences in which Peter discovers and then shakily/gleefully tries out his spider powers. Scenes of him climbing walls slinging webs and then gradually through awkward trial and error learning how to use them are cleverly worked out and great fun to experience. Its also enjoyable to watch how the film through a combination of acrobatic stand-ins and computer-generated imagery enables Spider-Man to hurtle and swoop through the concrete caverns of Manhattan as if he were Tarzan on the most elastic of jungle vines.What ""Spider-Man"" hasnt been able to manage is a creditable villain. Green Goblin the bad guy is in reality that fabulously wealthy scientist Norman Osborn who tested performance-enhancement drugs on himself and found out--too late--that the potential risks of violent behavior and insanity were all too real.Screenwriter David Koepp who does a creditable job laying out Spideys origins has less to offer once our hero accepts that ""with great power comes great responsibility"" and starts to fight crime. Green Goblin is a completely generic evil-doer and the uninventive battles with him are not helped by dialogue like ""Goblin what have you done""What we do root for in ""Spider-Man"" is the romance between Mary Jane and Peter. Dunst and Maguire make a real connection on screen and we are involved in their relationship to an extent thats rare in films like this.Paradoxically this makes Parkers Clark Kent-ish unwillingness to tell MJ his secret identity less palatable than it would otherwise be. But with a sequel already in the works mere human desires arent allowed to get in the way of the almighty dollar.MPAA rating PG-13 for stylized violence and action. Times guidelines a few intense dreamlike sequences but otherwise fairly mild.Spider-ManTobey Maguire...Spider-Man/Peter ParkerWillem Dafoe...Green Goblin/Norman OsbornKirsten Dunst...Mary Jane WatsonJames Franco...Harry OsbornCliff Robertson...Ben ParkerRosemary Harris...May ParkerA Marvel Enterprises/Laura Ziskin production released by Columbia Pictures.

Once the focus shifts to Spideys face-off against the genetically juiced archvillain the Green Goblin its just a perfunctory clash between good and vile.FX-heads worry not Sequences of Spidey scaling skyscrapers and surfing his web really swing. Lifeless though is the conception and execution of Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) who resembles a chrome-plated Pokemon astride a bullet-belching Jet-Ski.This superhero-origin story (adapted by screenwriter David Koepp) is remarkably faithful to its own 1962 origins in the pages of Marvel comics. Because of its senior-high outcast who experiments with the onset of new powers powers ramped-up by new hormonal surges the first half of Raimis film is comparable to that masterpiece of high-school baroque Carrie.Maguire who seizes the part of Peter as if it were Hamlet has the fixed stare and oversized eyes common to the kids in Children of the Damned and in Walter Keane paintings. This minimalist evokes more emotions with fewer facial movements than any screen actor in memory.The slight pursing of his cupid lips suggests his vast longing for Kirsten Dunst who plays Peters neighbor Mary Jane. The slight bulging of his eyes suggests how incredibly empowered it feels to stand up to the cafeteria bully. The slight deepening of the cleft in his chin suggests the deepening split between his Peter Parker and Spider-Man personas. His stillness draws the audience toward him.As involving as Maguire is dramatically he is that thrilling in the early action sequences where Peter/Spidey tests his emerging talents. When the adolescent/arachnid discovers his capabilities were with him swinging from rooftop to rooftop down Broadway a surfer riding the wild tsunami of the New York skyline.Spider-Man is a coming-of-age story a revenge picture (Peter avenges the death of his uncle - played by Cliff Robertson - by becoming a crime-fighter) and best of all a star-crossed romance.Its got one of the best kisses in movie history Spidey hanging upside down delivers an open-mouth smooch to Mary Jane a lip-lock for the ages. And it also has one of the best descriptions of love a feeling as Peter explains to MJ ""that makes you feel stronger and weaker at the same time.""Too bad the showdown between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin is so anti-climactic. Hard to say whether the end of the film got rushed or the filmmakers just lost interest. While most of Spider-Man resonates its finale - like Dafoes voice from inside Green Goblins mask - rings hollow.Contact Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.Spider-Man  (Out of four stars)Produced by Laura Ziskin and Ian Bryce directed by Sam Raimi written by David Koepp based on the Marvel comic book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko photography by Don Burgess music by Danny Elfman distributed by Columbia Pictures.Running time 2 hours 1 min.Peter/Spider-Man. . .

"`Spidey Is Super - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Spider-man `Spidey Is SuperMOVIESThe Film Captures All The Color And Excitement Of The Comic-book Classic.September 21 2003|By Jay Boyar Sentinel ColumnistAmazing is the only word to describe itThe way Spider-Man looks as he swings through New York on his marvelous web in this 2002 blockbuster.As his lithe yet powerful red-and-blue form shimmies among the citys skyscrapers he embodies the arachnid agility that Steve Ditko Spideys first official artist captured on the comic-book page four decades ago.Spider-Man fulfills the promise of those drawings by charging them with dynamic realistically choreographed movement. The result in fact exceeds the web-slinging fantasies of even some of the Marvel superheros most devoted fans.No much of the movie doesnt quite live up to the exhilaration of those swinging scenes. But certainly its good enough to get the job done. Working from a script by David Koepp (Carlitos Way) director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan The Evil Dead) spins a yarn that respects the Marvel version without becoming ensnared by it.For the comic-book-challenged Spider-Mans legend was conceived by Stan Lee the characters original writer and editor and an executive producer of the new film.That legend concerns a bookish teenager named Peter Parker who attends a science exhibit where he is bitten by a freak spider. The fateful bite imbues the young man with great strength and agility and a ""spider sense"" that allows him to anticipate danger.In the movie Peter (Tobey Maguire) can also spin those wonderful webs. Add his famous costume and hes a superhero.Well maybe not quite. First he must learn the lesson offered by his Uncle Ben who along with his Aunt May raised him.""With great power comes great responsibility"" Peters uncle tells him. And the teenager takes it to heart in time to battle the fiendish Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe).Wearing a grinning fright mask and perched on a mechanical bat-wing glider the Green Goblin possesses powers that rival Spider-Mans own. Like those sensational scenes of Spidey swinging their battles above the citys streets are among the best parts of the film.But Raimi and Koepp have not forgotten to put the ""comic"" in this comic-book movie.The dialogue often has a humorous spin as when Aunt May concerned that her nephew is pushing himself too hard advises Peter to ease up a bit.""Youre not Superman you know"" she cautions.Peters first attempts to swing and to control his webs are terrific physical comedy. Theres also a hilarious sequence in which Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) Peters winsome next-door neighbor slips in their schools cafeteria while carrying her lunch tray. Peter not only catches her before she hits the ground he also grabs the tray and uses it to recover her lunch item by item.And speaking of Mary Jane the scene in which she and Spidey kiss for the first time is destined to become a classic. Its raining hes hanging upside-down and she moves in to thank him for rescuing her.As they say in the comic books Sigh MORELottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoDo your homework before painting or sealing cool deckPuerto Rico birth certificates How to get a new oneLottery results for Powerball Florida LottoLottery results for Powerball Florida Lotto Related ArticlesWebbed Wonder Wows UsMay 11 2003Stan Lee Offers His Spin On `Spider-manMay 3 2002Spider-Man flies to No. 1July 8 2012Wow That Web-slinger Is SwellMay 3 2002As Spider-Man changes so does AmericaAugust 10 2011Find More Stories AboutSpider-manTobey MaguireSam RaimiDavid KoeppIndex by Keyword|Index by Date|Privacy Policy|Terms of ServicePlease note the green-lined linked article text has been applied commercially without any involvement from our newsroom editors reporters or any other editorial staff.",http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2003-09-21/entertainment/0309170404_1_sam-raimi-spider-man-david-koepp,200,spider30,spider,orlandosentinel

Summer blooms are opening a month early and so are the brainless vacation blockbusters. So boys and girls gather around while I tell you about Spider-Man  in the hope that you wont have to find out for yourselves. When I was a kid I collected Captain Marvel and Superman  and considered Spider-Man a bus-and-truck version of Batman  so I know nothing about the Marvel Comics by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Judging from the dopey lavishly overproduced new movie directed by Sam Raimi Id guess Spider-Man was an action hero created to enthrall readers under the age of 10. (By 10 I had graduated from Nancy and Sluggo to Archie Betty and Veronica.) So I am just now catching up in time to discover what looks like about a trillion dollars worth of digital effects and 25 cents worth of plot. By day he is Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) a goony bespectacled and conveniently orphaned college nerd with a special passion for arachnids who lives with his kindly aunt and uncle (Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson) in an ugly row house in Queens. One day on a class science outing hes bitten by a genetically altered spider and when he wakes up the next morning toned and magnetized with camera-ready pecs hes been transformed from a human tweezer into-Pow Zowie- Spider-Man  With revitalized superhuman strength the shy egghead now flattens the bullies in the school cafeteria climbs buildings scales walls and flies from roof to roof on spider webs that shoot from his fingers like cotton-candy clotheslines. Crawling with subcutaneous insect juice he is at last ready to trap New Yorks rats and hoods in his webs and win the admiration of Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the unattainable girl next-door who plays Lois Lane to his Clark Kent. None of this is as easy at it looks. Spider-Mans archenemy in fighting the criminal underworld is an evil nemesis called the Green Goblin. By day he is a benevolent tycoon (Willem Dafoe) and the father of Peters best friend Harry (Golden Globe winner James Franco the chiseled newcomer who scored memorably in the recent television biopic about James Dean). By night he can fly too-but his motives are destruction and death. The Green Goblin looks like a laminated praying mantis wearing an Islanders mask. This maleficent monster sprays a toxic insecticide that is lethal to Spider-Man as he wreaks havoc on the space program the board of directors of his own corporation and especially Mary Jane. The movie works best when its funny (""What is that thing?"" ""I dunno but somebodys got to stop it"") and the funniest actor in it is not Mr. Dafoe who hisses like a leaky radiator but J.K. Simmons who has sprouted a full head of hair in a versatile turnaround from the bald sexual predator he plays on Oz . Mr. Simmons plays the ruthless cliche-spouting penny-pinching editor of the Daily Bugle  the sensation-seeking metropolitan rag where Peter works as a photographer. While nobody seems to wonder why Peter is the only cameraman in town who ever gets a picture of the web-spinning Spider-Man in action Mary Jane knows there is something about Spider-Mans kiss that she just cant put a finger on. And so it goes with the villain blowing up the cable on the tram to Roosevelt Island Mary Jane hanging from the 59th Street Bridge and Spider-Man in a dilemma about saving them all in one swoop. In the end the secret of Spider-Mans true identity wins out over romance. Get ready for the sequel. Despite all the technology the special effects are cheesy and despite the attempts to bring the characters to human dimensions the actors are upstaged by the noise. Tobey Maguires open-faced saucer-eyed innocence worked to better advantage in The Cider House Rules and The Ice Storm . As Spider-Man hes merely an inarticulate pawn. I liked Kirsten Dunst better as a blonde. As a sweater-girl sweetheart in garish red Dynel hair she looks strangely tough and chalky. Willem Dafoe chews scenery even when you cant see his teeth. Cliff Robertson is the warmest nicest uncle a spider ever had but what can you do with lines like ""With great power comes great responsibility""? The great Rosemary Harris clearly on board for a handsome paycheck bakes cookies and knits. In Spider-Man  the stunt men do all the work. What to say about the silly but not fanciful enough script by David Koepp? He wrote the screenplay for one of my favorite movies ( Apartment Zero ). He also wrote one of the worst movies of all time ( Mission Impossible ). Im glad hes rich. Send the children to Spider-Man and stay home with Six Feet Under . Woody Goes To Hollywood For grown-up laughs a moment of genuflection please for the continuing brilliance of Woody Allen. Hollywood Ending is his best film in years. After flirtations with Ingmar Bergman Chekhov and German Impressionism Woody has returned to top form tweaking Hollywood filmmaking with the kind of fresh ideas hilarious dialogue and classy satirical flourishes that can only blossom from a truly original mind. Before the bouncy strains of Bing Crosby singing ""Going Hollywood"" fade neurotic self-destructive Val Waxman (Woody) a once-great Oscar-winning director of critically acclaimed art films now reduced to shooting geriatric diaper commercials is offered a chance to make a comeback with a gritty 60 million gangster epic filmed on location in New York. He needs the job and his sleazy agent (director Mark Rydell) gets him ""half a million plus one-tenth of a percentage point after quadruple break-even."" But the film is being financed by the slick handsome studio chief (Treat Williams) who stole Vals now ex-wife Ellie (Tea Leoni) and Vals own live-in bimbo (Debra Messing from Will and Grace ) demands a role in the picture herself-all of which drives his jealousy shingles heart palpitations back problems hearing loss broken rotator cuff and ulcers into a Code 3 crisis. Problems plague the film from the start. Val wants to make it in black and white with a Cole Porter score like a ... well Woody Allen movie. The production designer (Isaac Mizrahi) wants to rebuild Harlem Central Park and the Empire State Building. The costumer (Marian Seldes) is a Diana Vreeland clone who abhors every color but pink. The Chinese cameraman only speaks Mandarin. Worse theres a journalist on the set covering the 10-week shoot for Esquire . But the coup de grace is delivered the first day when the director goes neurotically psychosomatically blind. Nobody plays frustration like a wrinkled pug that has just been petted backwards better than Woody. Muddling through it all with only his ex-wife in on the secret Woody has created enough wacky pratfalls and delicious slapstick situations for himself and the beautiful brainy and talented Ms. Leoni to catapult them both into a comedy dream team. By the time anyone gets a look at the rushes its a disaster all around-until that is Val like Jerry Lewis gets discovered by the French Its sort of a Hollywood ending with escargot which is not the least of Woodys inside jokes. Ms. Leoni is the most glamorous Seeing Eye dog a sightless card-carrying nut case ever had. Mr. Rydell is just perfect as the agent who will do anything to get his 10 percent and doesnt mind bending the rules because he doesnt have any. Curvaceous Tiffani Amber Thiessen has a lovely bit as the sexy leading lady who isnt secure or comfortable until she seduces the blind director who feels her breasts and thinks theyre sofa cushions. George Hamilton is a happy surprise spoofing himself in the bargain as the vain mysterious studio executive with no specific duties or abilities except to dress up the set with his Malibu tan and inquire discreetly about discount liposuction. (Theres one on every picture vaguely mumbling about ""overages"" and ""demographics"" and its never clear what they are doing there.) Hollywood Ending is a 40-carat cinematic jewel for anyone who has ever wondered about the insanity of a movie shot on location-and if you dont recognize the inmates then its obvious youve never visited one. Dreck-Or Something Like It The woefully derailed Life or Something Like It is not much of a movie. More of a train wreck-or something like it. Angelina Jolie may be many things but a nice upstanding career girl in sensible Laura Bush suits is not one of them. Playing a Seattle television reporter with tattoos discreetly concealed and a platinum wig she looks like a trashy Mamie Van Doren-or is that an oxymoron? When a street prophet predicts she will die in one week the self-involved material girl with a handsome baseball-star fiance and a perfect job rethinks her values repositions her priorities turns a transit strike into a rock concert falls in love with the cameraman she hates (Edward Burns the poor mans Ben Affleck) and finds redemption before her time runs out by rediscovering the joys of sex. But wait. On the last Friday before her biological clock ticks its way to the Pearly Gates she gets a network nod from a Good Morning America -style morning show and grabs the first plane for New York. ""Youre still technically legally and every other way alive"" says the script. ""Its still Thursday in Louisiana"" says the not-very- jolie Ms. Jolie. The speeded-up motion of city traffic and a lot of lousy pop songs are just two of the conceits director Stephen ( The Mighty Ducks ) Herek leans on to fill in the dead spots in a one-note plot. The script by John Scott Shepherd a Kansas City ad exec who cut his teeth on McDonalds commercials is dead on arrival. The film is formulaic delusional and about as accurate a depiction of life in television news (or something like it) as a Pillsbury bake-off. Its only point is that for an ambitious blonde in the big city the money fame and success of network TV cannot compare with the love of a good man back home. Trust me. Diane Sawyer did not start out this way.

To those unfamiliar with the legend of the superhero Tobey Maguire may seem a strange choice for the role but he fits the part like a spandex glove. More important Maguire is perfect as Spidey alter ego Peter Parker a mild-mannered high school student who borders on being a complete geek. For the most part the films script follows the 40-year-old comics basic premise. Parker is an ordinary guy who is accidentally given extraordinary powers after being bitten by a genetically altered spider (one of the points in which the film differs from the comic books). He gains superhuman strength and a spider-like ability to cling to any surface and becomes -- ta-da -- Spider-Man.

After his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) is killed in a carjacking Peter -- aka Spider-Man -- vows to fight crime and avenge his uncles death. Friends and enemies Peters only friend at school is Harry Osborn (James Franco who played the title role in TNTs ""James Dean""). Harry is the one person who knows about Parkers secret crush on the girl next door Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). But Harry has problems of his own namely his distant brilliant rich father Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). While Norman takes a special interest in Parkers future -- at the same time taking dangerous personal risks at work in order to secure a huge military contract -- Harry falls in love with Mary Jane. At this point a villain calling himself the Green Goblin appears and the stage is set for an epic battle between good and evil. Director Sam Raimi whose films include ""Darkman"" (1990) ""A Simple Plan"" (1998) and the ""Evil Dead"" cult films has been a lifelong fan of Spider-Man and it shows. Reportedly there is still a Spider-Man poster above Raimis old bed in his childhood home. He apparently campaigned for the job and its clear he had a vision for this adaptation from cartoon to big-screen three-dimensional reality. For the general audience the transitions from Maguire to stunt men to the computer-generated images are seemingly flawless. Sure if you want to look for flaws youll find them but youll miss the movie itself. Overall Raimi has created an amazing alternate reality with ""Spider-Man.""

Simmons; Director Sam Raimi; Author David Koepp; Producer (person) Avi Arad; Release Date Wide 05/03/2002; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Columbia Pictures Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted August 7 2012 -- 1200 AM EDT Spider-Man sucks you right in the moment that Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) a sweetly bashful high school science dork wakes up after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider and begins to discover his newfound powers. At school Peter is too shy to declare his love or even his like to the girl next door (Kirsten Dunst). All of a sudden an adhesive web shoots out of his palm and wreaks havoc in the cafeteria - as funny and low-down a pop metaphor for the messiness of adolescent sexual trauma as anything seen on the big screen since I Was a Teenage Werewolf. Hallway ruffians dont stand a chance against Peter whose new spider vision allows him to view punches coming at him in bullet-time slo-mo. Before long his hands sprout metallic microscales letting him shimmy up walls and when he learns with a bit of practice to control that spurting web (the way that adolescents will) he starts to use it as a giant slingshot trapeze. At that point hes gone--prancing from building to building swinging through New York City as if it were a concrete jungle gym. His movements become as effortless as his thoughts and were with him every step -- and leap -- of the way. Spider-Man an adventure in vicarious acrobatic daredeviltry has been excitingly staged by director Sam Raimi but its also a lightweight mock-campy script-by-David ""The One-Man Committee"" Koepp (Jurassic Park) movie with little visual style apart from the creation of Spider-Man himself. In his skintight hood and two-tone red-and-blue bodysuit with its silver web mesh and mirrored insect eyes Spider-Man looks like a phantom ballet dancer and its the impersonality of his presence that paradoxically liberates the movie. Hes the first of the mythic comic-book heroes whose presence on screen is largely a creation of digital effects and the slightly synthetic hyperreality of this bounding rubber-limbed figure actually brings the audience closer to the sensation of seeing a comic book come to life than weve gotten in the Superman or Batman films. The fact that the digital seams sometimes show is hardly a problem. If anything it mirrors the crude vitality of the Spidey drawings in the Marvel comics--the sense of a twitchy light-bodied avenger slipping and sticking around a city of skyscrapers; hes in the world but not quite of it. Freed from the usual actor-flying-in-a-big-cape chicanery the movie brings the physical iconography of a comic superhero alive before our eyes. At first the offbeat casting of Tobey Maguire with his gurgly-voiced passivity works well. He brings his own cuddly conviction to the ""divided"" role of a clandestine teen superhero. Maguire with a grave stare that still manages to twinkle always sounds like hes weighing each and every word as though he were stoned. Hes that rarity an entirely sincere actor so earnest in his cuteness that at times hes like an oversize baby. When Peter makes goo-goo eyes at Dunsts Mary Jane Watson or gets the hang of his invincibility by entering a kamikaze wrestling match Maguire makes it easy to root for him. Spurred by the carjacking murder of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) he then dedicates himself to cleaning the streets of crime. Yet unlike say Tim Burtons 1989 Batman Spider-Man never really draws you into an extravagant universe of good and evil at war and at play. As the movie charts its heros rise to fame complete with J.K. Simmons (of ""Oz"") in a kitschy crew cut as the loudmouth editor of the Daily Bugle and a series of encounters with street thugs who look about as threatening as bandits in a musical you can feel Spider-Man starting not to take itself seriously. Sure its only a comic-book movie but how much better if it took a cue from Raimis moody 1990 Darkman and didnt insist on reminding us of the fact. Maguire winning as he is never quite gets the chance to bring the two sides of Spidey -- the boy and the man the romantic and the avenger -- together. That hesitant voice starts to sound a little odd issuing from behind Spider-Mans mask and after a while you may start to ask Is our heros big-eyed daze of wonder hiding something or is there not much there to hide? Dunst has a role thats no more fleshed out than Maguires yet she lends even the smallest line a tickle of flirtatious music. A superhero demands a supervillain of course and Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin a former tech-industry entrepreneur gone mad with evil injects his scenes with jaunty mischief especially when hes surfing through the air to taunt Spider-Man. Dafoe with his skinny cheeks and Klaus Kinski mouth already looks a bit like a creature (Cobra-Man?) and his distinctive snaky rasp comes in handy when hes hidden behind the Goblins golden-green armor and frozen cackle of a mask. That it looks like a mask -- specifically one that you could go right out and purchase for Halloween -- only underscores that the character is in effect an all-surface knockoff of Jack Nicholsons Joker in Batman who had a far richer presence than anyone here. Spider-Man is a canny franchise escapade; it gets the job done. But it also leaves you hungry for something more and I dont necessarily mean the next episode.

Hoberman Almost Heroes Tuesday April 30 2002 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 2002-model Spidey a sensitive typephoto Columbia A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Poor misunderstood Spider-Man the most alienated teenage superhero of the 1960s gets careful treatment in the summers first aspiring blockbuster. Mildly cheesy but not overwrought this long-awaited future franchise is a competent seat-warmer at the box-office table for the two weekends preceding George Lucass Attack of the Clones. As directed by Sam Raimi from David Koepps script Spider-Man recounts the tale of the fortuitous arachnid bite that transforms nerdy Queens high school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) into a building-crawling web-swinging bullet-dodging crimefighter in a red bodysuit of his own design. The mode is action soap opera Although this masked vigilante soon takes up residence on the front page of the citys tabloids his most baroque entanglement is the long-running masochistic charade with the girl next door (Kirsten Dunst sent back to high school after her grown-up debut in The Cats Meow). Theres mood but no context. Neither the benign mystery-man remembered by the children of the 70s as Morgan Freemans colleague on The Electric Company nor the paranoid smart-aleck pride of Marvel comics ranked alongside Che Guevara and Bob Dylan in Esquires 1965 college popularity poll the 2002-model Spider-Man is a sensitive type--perhaps too much so to win over hardened partisans of Eminem and American Pie. Willem Dafoe who plays the villainous Green Goblin gives his paycheck a welcome campy edge savoring lines like ""Youve spun your last web Spider-Man"" while literally taking orders from his metallic green Kabuki mask. Still hes nearly overshadowed by J.K. Simmonss uncannily iconic impersonation of J. Jonah Jameson the barking newspaper editor who served as Spider-Mans ongoing nemesis in the original comic. Raimi never afraid of a cheap effect orchestrates some superb action set pieces. Spider-Mans swinging trapeze swoops through the concrete canyons of an entertainingly jumbled New York in pursuit of the air-surfing Goblin are nearly worth the price of admission. Indeed there could easily have been twice as many of these agravitational acrobatic displays one of which seemingly incorporates Macys Thanksgiving Day parade and it wouldnt have hurt for Raimi to slow down the ballet every once in a while the better to present the spectacle of Gobby and Spidey hilariously voguing against the skyline in their Halloween outfits. As the Peter Parker backstory recalls the white working-class Queens of another era giving Marvels greatest star the full Austin Powers treatment would have been pure Fun City with a period Spider-Man haunting pop art openings be-ins and miscellaneous drug hallucinations. But thats another war. The current one is acknowledged when the beleaguered citizens of New York some dangling above the East River express their solidarity against Goblinistic terrorism ""An attack against one is an attack against us all"" A vastly more elaborate 60s comic book Chris Markers three-hour A Grin Without a Cat looks back on that time of tumult from the perspective of the May 1977 breakup of Frances Socialist-Communist alliance and in a 1993 coda from the vantage of the Soviet Unions collapse. Worked and reworked A Grin Without a Cat--which is now having its U.S. theatrical premiere in 35mm with an English voice-over just in time for May Day--is a movie of temporal striation. Marker assembles all manner of archival footage (TV reports guerrilla newsreels government propaganda interviews) to create an all-over 60s. There are outtakes from other peoples films as well as material cut by censors. Marker begins by evoking Battleship Potemkin and although hardly agitprop A Grin Without a Cat is in that tradition--a montage film with a mass hero. Unlike Eisenstein however Marker isnt out to invent historical truth so much as to look for it. (The untranslatable French title Le Fond de lAir Est Rouge is a play on words suggesting that revolution was in the air but not on the ground.) A Grin Without a Cat recapitulates the received wisdom of the 60s and passes it on. The New Left found its inspiration in the post-colonial struggle--or what Marker cleverly terms ""the Third World War."" Vietnam was comparable to the Spanish Republic as an international rallying point; the Chinese Cultural Revolution was ""the new 1917."" The phrase ""revolution within the revolution"" explains both Mao Tse-tungs political rejuvenation and the split between romantic Communist guerrillas and orthodox Communist bureaucrats. For Marker this opposition is exemplified by the now forgotten failed insurgency in Venezuela although it is Che Guevaras doomed Bolivian adventure that gives the movie its English-language title. In a symbolic sense this same conflict was played out in what was then called the Metropolis. A Grin Without a Cat reaches its emotional peak with the hopeful New Left demonstrations that swept Europe in 1967. (A placard prophesies that ""the workers will take the struggle from the fragile hands of the students."") But as felt in the tempo of the filmmaking the tide turns in May 1968 A long less than exciting section on the various strikes and committees of 68 culminates with the pointless attack on the annual theater festival in Avignon. A Grins second part surveys the reaction to the forces that had been released. The selective elimination of revolutionary vanguards includes the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia the U.S.-backed overthrow of Salvador Allende in Chile the repackaging of American protest as the televised Watergate hearings and Frances stultifying alliance of the left. (""The slowest party to de-Stalinize was then the quickest to de-Leninize"" Markers narrator says of the French CP.) This synopsis scarcely does the movie justice. Marker has a genius for poetic aphorism and the documentary equivalent of the bon mot. Its typical that he would create a classification of footage shot with ""shaking hands"" or zero in on Fidel Castros struggle with an immovable Soviet microphone. A Grin can also be willfully eccentric. Apropos of nothing unless its an inversion of his movies English title Marker interpolates footage of an impressively pagan Belgian cat festival--full of giant floats puppets and masques--into a series of public events marking the end of the left. More impressionistic than analytical A Grin Without a Cat is a grand immersion. Is it a tract without a thesis? Perhaps this Belgian digression like the movie celebrates memory itself--along with the cunning of history a force that Marker notes ""always seems to have more imagination than we do."" ABC Africa Abbas Kiarostamis digital-video field report is not unlike Chris Markers earliest documentaries--a personal self-reflexive travelogue that ruminates as much on the circumstances of its making as its ostensible subject. The first image shows a fax crawl across the screen a UN agency inviting the Iranian filmmaker to make a movie on Ugandas 1.6 million AIDS orphans. ABC Africa which was filmed over 10 days began as Kiarostamis visual jottings but it has the conceptual heft of his finished films. The atmosphere of crisis recalls Life and Nothing More; the long shots from moving cars as well as the interest in children are present in his previous work. As in The Wind Will Carry Us the urban intellectual arrives in a backward village characterized by its stubborn adherence to a shared mentality. Ugandas enlightened attitude toward AIDS prevention is established by prominent posters encouraging the use of condoms and government social workers who explain a strategy designed to care for the orphans. But what may be disturbing about ABC Africa is that it doesnt seem disturbing enough. The emphasis in this surprisingly cheerful film is on the resilience of the living. The kindergarten atmosphere of kids staring into the camera making faces and jumping around is only somewhat mitigated by a trip to a hospital where a dead child is packed for burial in a cardboard box and bicycled off to oblivion. Kiarostami is most engaged by the long seemingly spontaneous group performances his presence occasions. Theres a Gauguin-esque aspect to these colorful spectacles. Although its debatable whether they represent a utopian form of social organization the numbers are well suited to the filmmakers confident--at times brilliant--use of DV. Fulfilling his mandate to make useful publicity Kiarostami unavoidably expressed himself. In the most impressive sequence the electricity goes out and the movie continues in the dark. After five or six minutes the landscape is dramatically illuminated by lightning--a found metaphor that suggests the sudden flashes by which the artist learned his African alphabet.
