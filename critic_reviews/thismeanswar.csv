Buddy-action-romcom This Means War tries so hard to be charming that its initially unsettling then sort of sweet and finally just pathetic. Which considering the combined charisma of its cast is something of an achievement in itself.Reese Witherspoon is Lauren a kooky consumer researcher who inadvertently comes between CIA top guns Tuck (Tom Hardy) and FDR (Chris Pine). Realising theyve been pursuing the same woman these erstwhile BFFs are plunged into a war of romantic attrition with all the resources of the Agencys LA field office at their disposal surveillance gear night-vision goggles knockout pills the lot.Theres a decent knockabout comedy buried somewhere inside This Means War but itd take a lot of chipping away to find it. Take for instance comedian Chelsea Handlers turn as Witherspoons obligatory loudmouthed sexually overactive pal what should be a mildly amusing secondary role is overwritten and horribly played as Handler aims for fashionable Knocked Up-style bad taste and comes off like a cross between Joan Rivers and Chubby Brown.There are similar misfires littered throughout the movie Witherspoon shoots for endearing and ends up simply odd while Pine goes for smooth and winds up at seedy. Only Hardy emerges with any dignity and thats because he doesnt do much. There are a few decent throwaway gags and director McG knows his way around a shiny action sequence but This Means War is yet another case of Hollywood execs trying way too hard to give the audience what they think it wants.

I have seen this film so many times before from the stylised car chase to the cliffhanger on the freeway to the Eastern European bad guys.. It adds nothing new and yes there is a bit to much from the female friend. It is amusing in places and not without its charms. Its ok but not great.

By Anthony Lane Chris Pine Reese Witherspoon and Tom Hardy in a new movie directed by McG.   Credit Illustration by Edwin Fotheringham If you already know Francois Truffauts ""Jules et Jim"" then you should be able with minor adjustments to make sense of ""This Means War."" All you need to do is reconfigure Jules and Jim as hip young gunslingers in the C.I.A. who though resident in Los Angeles spend the first scene shooting a bunch of hoods on the roof of a Hong Kong high-rise. You must also imagine that Jim has tattoos and a Cockney accent whereas Jules has a glass-bottomed pool in the ceiling of his apartment so that he can watch women do the breaststroke from below. (Unusual on a government salary.) Oh and our heroes final feat is to wrestle each other while falling out of the back of an airplane into the howling night. Apart from that as I say its just like Truffaut. The Jules character is known as F.D.R. (Chris Pine) and the new-look Jim is Tuck (Tom Hardy). Trapped between them in place of Jeanne Moreau is Reese Witherspoon. She plays Lauren for whose heart the two guys aggressively compete using the skills acquired in counter-terrorism; both of them for instance break into her house and plant listening devices while shes making popcorn. Lauren is employed by a product-testing company called Smart Consumer. Something about the wanton lack of imaginative effort behind that name tells you a lot about ""This Means War"" which is less of a motion picture and more of a product that has itself been tested to the point of exhaustion for its loyalty to the tropes of two genres the romantic comedy and the blustering thriller. No film whose first conversation includes the words ""Mission is a go. Repeat you are green to go"" can be expected to break fresh ground and this work unstinting in its duties toward the frighteningly obvious provides a granite-faced European villain a Russian henchman who is tracked down to a strip joint and strapped to a dancers pole and for Lauren a best friend with a fat husband and a filthy mouth. The director is McG who really should come out of the Witness Protection Program and get himself a proper name. Another possibility which I find ever more credible is that he is not a person but a committee of A.D.H.D. sufferers all of whom have been issued with extra caffeine and a Spotify account. No motion however slight is allowed to pass without a musical energy boost; when Lauren and F.D.R. make out back at her place they do so not in privacy but with a noisy thrashing of rock to goad them on as if a guitarist and a drummer were crouching in the bathroom. The same thing happens unbelievably when F.D.R. is hit in the neck with a tranquillizer dart--one event that even McG might have associated with mental calm. What fuels these incidents I think and what governs the movies fistfights which come across as a blizzard of random punches is not eagerness but fear. When William Wellman and his crew filmed aerial combat for ""Wings"" (1927) the first movie to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards--and by coincidence another tale of two pals who adore the same dame--the aim was one of exhilarated clarity. The studios that churn out ""This Means War"" and its ilk on the other hand seem genuinely worried that an audience left to contemplate human deeds without the assistance of sonic or editorial frenzy might start to think for itself. People might look at Chris Pines eyes and wonder first why a blue so startling and unreal should suggest not the gleam of a born seducer but one of the stronger brands of industrial cleaning gel. And second whether the character he depicts here for all its vigor is anything more than a jerk. That is certainly how Lauren reads him at the start. They meet at a video store a setting that might have seemed fresh and topical sometime around the summer of 1993. He actually says ""I know movies. And women"" a boast that would be correct only if uttered by George Cukor. At a follow-up encounter Lauren credits him with ""the emotional intelligence of a fifteen-year-old boy."" So why do her powers of discrimination desert her? Maybe because she has the sartorial intelligence of a fifteen-year-old girl tiny-skirted dresses in baby blue or even smaller shorts with teetering wedge heels--the latter worn to a pet shelter where she croons over the abandoned mutts. To compare her with the knowing resourceful and far from docile female figure in ""Wings"" (none other than Clara Bow) is a cause for shame. Such is the cultural evidence that is submitted by ""This Means War"" irrefutable proof that in certain areas of Hollywood sexual politics are going backward fast. Reese Witherspoon is a woman aged thirty-five with a bundle of grownup roles behind her. Yet in order to retain her slot in romantic comedy it appears she must reverse into her teens. What makes the transition yet more depressing is the memory of Tracy Flick. Witherspoon was twenty-three when she played Tracy in ""Election"" and Tracy herself was only a high-school student but her soul was bent on adult habits of command and control. She was nobodys friend but she was nobodys fool. I long to know not just where she is now--along what corridors of finance or government she stalks--but also what she would make of a ditz like Lauren who mopes at length over her own inability to choose a mate. And heres the joke although she does eventually choose between Tuck and F.D.R. (a decision I would be happy to reveal if I could remember what it was) neither of them needs her. They are perfectly content as partners buddies and who knows given time something more. ""I love you man"" one says at the climax of events. ""Love you too"" the other replies. This doesnt mean war at all. This means peace. The opening moments of ""Bullhead"" are rich in foreboding and gloom with a dark wood glimmering into view at the edge of a field and yet after the cacophony of ""This Means War"" they come as a blessed relief. A low voice speaks ""Sometimes in a mans life stuff happens that makes everyone go quiet."" Over the next two hours one particular man will loom into being like the forest. His name is Jacky (Matthias Schoenaerts) a cattle farmer in the Flemish-speaking region of Belgium and you could easily mistake him for a member of his herd. He is several sizes larger in every direction than the surrounding humans and he walks with a swinging bovine slouch. The director of photography Nicolas Karakatsanis who mostly does a marvellous job turns to slow-motion to emphasize that gait but there is no need. Most troubling of all is Jackys face with its lazy eye and its air of inward bruising as if somebody once upon a time had treated him like meat. The movie takes place in what is referred to as ""the hormone Mafia underworld"" a district of criminal experience into which even Tony Soprano no veal calf himself might have hesitated to stray. We learn of it but not much about it and I was soon floundering in the slurry of furtive transactions that passes for a plot--rendered even thicker by the doubleness of Belgian society with its linguistic split. A couple of French-speaking car mechanics from Liege are to the detriment of the movies mood played for laughs; who would have guessed that the French would be the doltish butt of the Flemish? Yet such are the precision and the poise wielded elsewhere by the director Michael R. Roskam that in the end he more than merits the benefit of the doubt as well as the Oscar nomination that ""Bullhead"" has received for Best Foreign-Language Film. The murk in other words is deliberate. Whether the bottles and the vials lined up in Jackys fridge are meant for cattle to increase growth or whether they contain the testosterone that he injects into himself for the same reason is a confusion left unresolved. Jacky is not merely beefed up. He is a Minotaur in the making and that surely is why his story becomes such a labyrinth. Not that he suddenly sprouts horns or a ring through his nose. There are almost no special effects in ""Bullhead"" and only scattered outbreaks of violence. Jacky threatens more with a light slap than most of us could do with a battering ram. There arent even many cows to be seen. Roskams concern is brutish behavior wherever he finds it among men; ""You are all animals"" in the nervous words of Lucia (Jeanne Dandoy) who runs a perfume store. She knew Jacky briefly twenty years ago and is one of the few people with some understanding of what he suffered then. The flashbacks to that period with Robin Valvekens as the young Jacky--a beautiful boy which only makes things worse--could not be more traumatic and the constant inescapable shove of the past leaves ""Bullhead"" feeling less like muscular melodrama and more like a sad saga of distress and loss. ""Dont break anything"" Lucia tells Jacky when he visits her as if her home were a china shop. But the damage was done long ago.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

A movie about two CIA agents (Tom Hardy and Chris Pine) who are dating the same woman (Reese Witherspoon). Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""This Means War"" is the worst McG film yet. And good Lord that is saying something. The director formerly known as Joseph McGinty Nichol who gave us ""Terminator Salvation"" and ""Charlies Angels -- Full Throttle"" brings his pummeling touch to one of the most unnecessary audience-abusing incoherent stupefyingly dumb movies of our young century. This is a romantic comedy crossed with a spy thriller crossed with a migraine. Reese Witherspoon her perkiness dialed up to 11 plays Lauren the head of a consumer product testing lab. In her off hours from blowtorching frying pans Lauren yearns for that special someone with the ditsy insecurity of a high school wallflower. Her brassy gal pal Trish (Chelsea Handler in a performance as grating as two bricks rubbed together) posts Laurens profile on a singles site attracting the eye of Tuck (Tom Hardy) a lonely-hearts CIA agent. Most films would recognize by now the absurdity saturation point has been reached. But ""This Means War"" presses heedlessly ahead introducing Tucks BFF fellow spy FDR (Chris Pine) into the equation. Lauren who doesnt know they are pals kind of likes both and in the spirit of product comparisons dates them simultaneously which -- ick. With neither man willing to step down they begin a clandestine alls-fair battle for her heart sabotaging each other with high-tech spycraft and lowdown skullduggery. Shock of shocks this doesnt turn out to be such a good idea. Science-fiction writers use the term ""Idiot Plot"" to describe a story that would not hold together unless the main players were imbeciles. For ""This Means War"" to work the audience would have to be idiots as well. Credible characters might provide a touch of interest for this ludicrous premise but there are none. Witherspoons umpteenth mate-selection romcom taps no new reservoirs of charm. Pine delivers his lines with his formidable eyebrows arched indicating that he understands the film is intended to be a farce. Hardy an excellent actor when given a chance plays it straight which is a more honest rendering of the flat-lining script. The scene in which Witherspoon nails Hardy in the crotch with an errant paintball is not likely to go on either actors highlights reel. Theoretically there must be a way to make this movie work but no one involved has a clue as to what that might be. Each of the stars has been fine in earlier projects so they arrive on the screen with a sort of dowry of goodwill. After 98 minutes of mirthless tomfoolery those warm feelings have soured into the blackest bile. There is not a graceful stylish moment here nor an image that resembles real life right down to the flagrantly unconvincing soundstage sets. With its skeevy premise lifeless action sequences and crass comedy this is a ""War"" on the audience. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Take our movie trivia quiz Monitor Movie Guide ""This Means War"" is being promoted as a Valentines Day special but it would more appropriately fit into Veterans Day. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play best buddy CIA agents Foster and Tuck who in the films opening gambit fire off more rounds than an entire US Army battalion. The high-low concept here is that both guys end up romancing the same woman - the lovelorn Lauren played by Reese Witherspoon in her industrial-strength charm mode. Lauren has no idea what these guys really do for a living which doesnt make much sense. But then again nothing in this film makes much sense. The director McG (""Charlies Angels"") is clearly more at home with the blam-blam stuff than the smoochie scenes. The best you can say about ""This Means War"" is that it would make a good date movie for couples in the witness protection program. Grade C (Rated R for some sexual content.)

You have a rugged handsomeness about you or alternatively an elegant grace and people go out of their way to help you in all your pursuits. You dont need a library card to borrow books someone else always takes care of lunch and your Netflix queue is curated by a team of well wishers who only want to see you happy. This would be a good life no doubt though there would be something potentially sinister going on underneath the surface. You see somewhere in all this forward momentum for your desires youd lose something vital call it motivation drive or ambition and youd simply become a person of style and smiles. This is This Means War. It is also a very long opening paragraph. The films premise is clear from the trailer poster title and font choices. MAN vs. MAN for a WOMAN. You havent heard of anything like that in around twenty minutes right? The difference is where most films would simply cast Channing Tatum this one went the extra kilometer and employed Chris Pine. Where every other movie would call upon Jude Law this casting director screamed into a phone ""Get me HARDY"" And when the most obvious choice possible for the role was Reese Witherspoon This Means War decided instead to go with Reese Witherspoon just to throw us off the scent Sure that last example doesnt totally work but the point remains This Means War is at least 67 percent innovative where the charm factor is concerned and this is what inevitably carries the entire enterprise. Without these delightful leads youd have an amorphous goo as opposed to what comes off as a perfectly pleasant rom-com. But thats getting ahead of ourselves. Tuck (Tom Hardy) and FDR (Chris Pine) are C.I.A. ""agents"" in the movie sense of the word. They are (evidently?) independently wealthy drive fast cars and kill bad guys. They are also partners and best friends but again only in the ""movie rom-com lead"" sense of the word. They are close because the script suggests they are close we dont have all day here move it along. Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) is a confident successful product tester who often hosts focus groups. Aside why are the women who cant find men always hard-charging career ladies? Why arent they ever deadbeats? Where are the men out there to whom a successful career is a ""deal breaker""? I dont think any of that is a real thing anymore though I tend to live in a fantasy land. Back to the lecture at hand Laurens sister Trish (Chelsea Handler) feels that Lauren is wasting her life without the sweet sweet lovin of a good man so she signs her up for online dating. Tuck prompted by FDR (who feels he doesnt get out enough) sends her a date request. FDR accidentally meets her out in public as he seeks to protect Tuck from getting hurt during the date. It then becomes a stand-off between friends as to who will get the girl. They both develop feelings for her with Chelsea Handler providing the commentary. Aaaaaaaaand scene. Now if youve ever seen a movie before you can recite many of the bits before they even happen. There will be surveillance gags. Paintball is going to occur. Along the way the friends are going to get perturbed with each other and the competition is going to get fierce. Who will Lauren choose? The ""smooth operating"" FDR? Or the more sincere and sensitive Tuck? Which is precisely where The Means War cant simply get by on its substantial charms as the structure of the piece is so formulaic that even Hardy amp; Pine cant rescue every minute of it. But an hour? An hour twenty? No problem. Sure Hardy amp; Pine never exactly ""save"" this film from its own internal flaws but they can certainly make you smile fellas and ladies alike.

This Means War (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review This Means War (PG-13) This hybrid of rom-coms and action flicks fails on both counts. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com2/17/2012 Editor rating 1 Early on in This Means War comes one of the most dispiriting scenes ever witnessed in a movie theater A couple (Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine) meets cute at a video store and the boy charms the girl with his deep knowledge of this obscure director named ... Alfred Hitchcock. But then the girl cleverly turns the tables on the boy Because she knows about Hitchcock too Ha Isnt that adorable? I know I know There are at least two generations of moviegoers who may have never seen a Hitchcock film or know Psycho from Marnie. But Witherspoon is playing an executive for a product-testing research company and Pine is playing a CIA agent. Theres nothing funny or clever about two presumably educated intelligent adults being aware of Alfred Hitchcock. It is a weak lazy uninspired gag. That goes for the rest of the movie too. This Means War is an attempt by director McG to blend two popular genres -- the chick flick and the shoot-em-up -- into one gargantuan epic date movie. Except he gets neither of the halves right. The action which bookends the movie is atrocious defying all laws of gravity and physics and machine gun-edited into incomprehensible lunacy. If you ever happen to find yourself in a situation where you have no other choice but to watch This Means War -- while on an 18-hour flight perhaps or being tortured at Guantanamo Bay -- pay close attention to what the bad guy does during the climactic car chase and explain to me how that makes even a tiny bit of sense even in a cartoon such as this one. The other half of This Means War the one that takes up most of the movie follows the rivalry between two best friends and fellow CIA agents (Pine and Hardy) after they fall for the same woman (Witherspoon). Why is a knockout like Witherspoon still single yet reluctant to go out on dates? Because shes afraid of serial killers. Why does she intentionally start dating two guys at the same time? Because she cant make up her mind. On her first date with Hardy he takes her to a mysteriously abandoned circus where they climb onto the trapeze and perform a little routine. But Pine on their date takes her to this warehouse in which he just happens to have all these original paintings by Gustav Klimt her favorite artist. How can she possibly pick between them? Anyone else might be a little curious as to how you just happen to have an art collection worth several hundreds of millions of dollars lying around. But not Witherspoon because all the characters in This Means War are required to be idiots in order for the movie to proceed. Romantic comedies require a sizable suspension of disbelief -- theyre wish-fulfillment fantasies -- but This Means War is so preposterous its insulting. What are we to make of that woman in a bikini who swims in the glass-bottomed pool that forms the roof of Pines apartment? Who lives beneath a glass-bottomed pool anyway? Wouldnt you be constantly looking up and worrying it was going to break? Charlies Angels McGs first film did a nice job of balancing absurdist humor and ridiculous action The movie was a goof but a pleasant one and easy to go along with. This Means War is just as irreverent but without the whimsy or charm. The three extremely charismatic leads are capable of making you smile when the director cedes the spotlight to them such as the shot in which a horrified Witherspoon halfway through a date discovers shes had a bit of food stuck to her teeth all this time. But these actors are too smart to play things this dumb and McGs meaningless camera antics (such as a ridiculous homage to GoodFellas) lack a punchline Theyre style for styles sake. This Means War isnt a blight on humanity like The Ugly Truth or Jack and Jill. But the film is vulgar and off-putting and insulting a procession of illogical happenings and product placements (every movie that appears on TV screens in the film happens to be owned by distributor 20th Century Fox). Its a date movie for suckers. Cast Reese Witherspoon Chris Pine Tom Hardy Til Schweiger Chelsea Handler. Director McG. Screenwriters Timothy Dowling Simon Kinberg. Producers Simon Kinberg James Lassiter Robert Simmonds. A 20th Century Fox release. Running time 98 minutes. Vulgar language violence sexual situations adult themes.

You can imagine how the ball got rolling on ""This Means War. You can also imagine how the folks who rolled the ball started to lose their minds. What if a woman was dating two guys? What if the two guys were friends? What if the friends were also co-workers? What if the co-workers were CIA spies? What if the spies started doing their work on each other? What if that work culminated with combat at a Los Angeles restaurant while the woman is talking to herself in the ladies room only to return to an obliterated dining room? What if she stood amid all the smoking destruction and was upset only that the two lovers/friends/spies lied to her? What if the case the spies had been working on were then fired from and then put back on had blasted its way into the romance plot? What if people paid to see this?""This Means War is a romantic comedy whose DNA consists of other movies television action shows sitcoms and comic strips. Its got both a soap opera plotline and a Chuck Norris-load of taxpayer-financed gadgets and gear. It also has Reese Witherspoon in another terrible part. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play the dates and anything even passably fun that happens here happens between them - the banter the arguments the hurt feelings the time in close quarters the declarations of fidelity betrayal and love. Part of the deal with Witherspoons character Lauren is that neither man can sleep with her until shes made her final choice which means once again sexual chastity is a greater movie virtue than civility on the highways and in the restaurants of Los Angeles. You can blow up the world but for the love of June Carter Cash dont touch Reese Witherspoon.Pine is tall boldly coiffed and cocky. Hardy whos English is compact tattooed and sensitive. They both have nice chests and sofa cushions for lips. Theyre such good foils for each other that it takes only the opening action sequence to realize that once she arrives Witherspoon will be as much of a gadget as all the tranquilizer darts and flying drones.The screenwriter Simon Kinberg who shares a credit with Timothy Dowling also wrote the two most recent X-Men films ""Jumper and ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith that movie in which Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt spend two hours trying to annihilate each other. ""This Means War is ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith without the nasty conjugal metaphor. Its friskiness might be actionable How best to bug a ladys home or GPS her life in order to get into her pants? But Pines character reminds us its government sanctioned ""Patriot Act The director is McG who in two ""Charlie Angels movies has already trod this gravelly road of sex and action. In that series at least he could sustain a wink. The sexiness was funny and the women were in on the gags co-owners of the fantasy the movie was selling. Lauren doesnt control anything ultimately not even whether shes allowed to have sex with two men. The movie sticks her with the comedian Chelsea Handler who plays Laurens bawdy older friend. Shes funny but to limit the danger of her barbs the movie makes her a stay-at-home mom not a single lady whod want in on Laurens action. Really that relationship is the most convenient way for the two men to eavesdrop on Laurens reviews of her dates and learn how to better impress her. Pines spy tries to wow Lauren with the paintings of Gustav Klimt. Hardys takes her paint-balling and introduces her to his son. All Witherspoon gets to do with all three actors is react.Shes not the only misused woman here. The movies punch line about sex is one of the more perverse revelations Ive seen performed in the spirit of confessional fun. And Angela Bassett plays the peeved boss of the CIA boys. She comes into her scenes typically full-throttle and is 100 expletives shy of being Eddie Murphys combustible boss in ""Beverly Hills Cop. Its a part thats beneath thankless.Whatevers happening with women and romance at the moment is worrying. Rachel McAdams spends ""The Vow trapped in a post-adolescent self with no memory of the woman she was before a car accident. ""One for the Money turns Janet Evanovichs tough eccentric bounty hunter into Katherine Heigl. Kristen Stewart spent four ""Twilight movies pleading for a vampire to make love to her; when he does she almost dies giving birth to their demon-child. On ""30 Rock Tina Feys Liz Lemon is now so pitifully addicted to the approval of Jack Donaghy that she no longer knows what she wants in a relationship. This version of Witherspoon might be the most dismaying of all since shes not even a woman. Shes a place to plant a flag. Its hard to see her in this movie say enjoying a private dance to Montell Jordans ""This Is How We Do It while Pine and Hardy secretly watch her from inside her house and not feel vengeful.

""This Means War"" is a totally frothy film. And thats a good thing at least here. (Sometimes  substance is overrated. As Samuel Goldwyn once famously said ""If you want to send a message go to Western Union."") This stylish and fun romantic action comedy is about two best buddies whose friendship is tested when they discover that they are dating the same woman. FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) are top agents at the CIA where they work together out of the Los Angeles office -- who knew? -- catching bad guys round the world. When they realize that theyre both courting Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) a consumer products expert each man begins to conduct high-tech surveillance on the others romantic progress installing listening bugs hidden cameras and the like. ""War"" is the adult version of Mad magazines venerable Spy vs. Spy feature. As each man becomes more serious about Lauren his tactics and enmity toward the other escalates. Their friendship is threatened as is their focus on finding the movies villain (Til Schweiger) in a seemingly throwaway plot thread. As buoyantly directed by McG (""Terminator Salvation"") all of this plays out with the requisite swagger and sass. The cast is attractive and appealing the dialogue fast and often funny and it all moves at rapid enough speed that a viewer doesnt have time to be bothered by the films lack of character development or believability. Witherspoon seems of late to be making a practice of starring in films where she is betwixt and between two men (2010s lethargic ""How Do You Know"" and last years ""Water for Elephants""). She gives a likable performance here always impressing as just a little smarter and more competent than either of her swains. Pine whose intense blue eyes in this movie register as almost otherworldly displays a brash charm; hes like an enthusiastic puppy eager to nuzzle with Witherspoon. Hardy whose own charm is more roughhewn doesnt seem quite as at ease just skating on the surface as his costars. Turning up in supporting roles are comic and talk-show host Chelsea Handler as Laurens potty-mouthed best friend and Angela Bassett as the CIA agents boss. The former turns in her usual choleric shtick on sex and men while the talented latter is given way too little to do. ""War"" is the kind of glossy light-hearted fare that studios used to know how to turn out regularly but seem of late to have lost the knack for making. Its mostly a kick to watch means nothing and is designed only to entertain. Victory achieved. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 17 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Feb. 16 2012 228PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English Opening wide in sneak previews on Tuesday night before its official launch Friday This Means War is a Valentines date dud Think wilted roses squashed chocolates and flat champagne. Though promoted as a romantic thriller in practice this film (from Charlies Angels director Joseph McGinty Nichol who goes by McG with co-screenwriter Simon Kinberg ( Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith) is a tepid sex farce about two best-friend CIA agents (Chris Pine and Tom Hardy) out to bed the same woman (Reese Witherspoon). Chris Pine in a frame grab from This Means War on YouTube. Multimedia This Means War official trailer Reese Witherspoon arrives for the U.K. premiere of This Means War at a west London cinema in Kensington Monday Jan. 30 2012. Joel Ryan / AP Film Video Reese Witherspoon premieres War in U.K. An opening introduces us to agents Tuck (Hardy) who has an English accent a puppy gaze and gelled hair and Franklin or FDR Pine) whos American with glowing blue eyes and moussed hair. Shortly after charming a bevy of sleek femmes at a fancy cocktail event in Hong Kong the two men are on a high-rise roof shooting guns and dangling over precipices to thwart a robbery. In the aftermath they have earned the enmity of scowling bad guy Heinrich (German star Til Schweiger) and the annoyance of their boss (Angela Bassett) who grounds them. While theyre doing desk duty compulsive womanizer Franklin pushes the sensitive Tuck who is separated from his wife (Abigail Leigh Spencer) and his son to jump back into the dating pool. Meanwhile we meet plucky-but-single Lauren (Witherspoon) who is busy pursuing her own career (""I love my job"") testing consumer products. Her best friend married boozy daycare worker Trish (Chelsea Handler) seeks vicarious thrills by posting a racy ad for Lauren on a dating website. Tuck answers it and Lauren meets him for lunch where they enjoy an instant gooey-eyed attraction. Minutes later Lauren wanders over to an improbably well-stocked video store where coincidentally Franklin hits on her. Inspired by her curt rebuff he tracks her down to interrupt her during a product focus session until she agrees to go out with him. When the two best buddies discover they are after the same woman they make a ""gentlemans agreement"" not to reveal to Lauren that they know each other. Using all their CIA surveillance gadgets including hidden cameras and GPS devices they engage in a creepy contest to see which of them will finally penetrate their targets perimeter. There are elements here from the Rock Hudson/Doris Day films of the late fifties and sixties starting with Pillow Talk with Witherspoon as the thirtysomething single career gal being romantically deceived. There are also some contemporary raunchy ingredients with comic Handler delivering a stream of genital jokes (though her acting is so weak she cant wisecrack and make eye contact at the same time) and the ever-popular bromance theme although its more of a Zoolander-like suppressed homo-mance here. The pretty stars try gamely. Ultimately Witherspoon disappoints the most in the kind of helpless ingenue role she should have put behind her a decade ago. Rising character actor Hardy ( Inception Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and the upcoming The Dark Knight Rises) will live this down. The only real winner here could be Pine ( Star Trek) whose comic timing is surprisingly sharp. Too often though the dialogue is upstaged by the overwrought interior design while the action sequences including a climactic car chase when Heinrich shows up again are incoherent. Its a bad sign when a film which aims only for froth cant achieve more than moments of embarrassment punctuated with sporadic agitation.

Starring Tom Hardy Reese Witherspoon Chris Pine Laura Vandervoort Til Schweiger Chelsea Handler Angela Bassett David Koechner Director McG Running time 200 Release Opened Feb 17 2012  Editorial Review The eyes have it. The plot doesnt.By Ann HornadayFriday Feb. 17 2012""Mr. and Mr. Smith"" anyone? The romaction comedy ""This Means War"" stars Reese Witherspoon as a woman trying to choose between two handsome suitors. But as this sloppy scattered utterly synthetic piece of Hollywood widgetry unspools it becomes increasingly clear that the romantic tension at play exists mostly between the men in question. As super-spies and best friends whose professional and personal relationship begins to fray as they vie for alpha-dog status Chris Pine and Tom Hardy can barely conceal their characters longing and heartbreak. Even when the three finally face off in the movies preposterously ballistic third act its the guys who only have eyes for each other. But oh what eyes. Pine - who was so good as the young James Kirk in ""Star Trek"" that you still cant look at him without thinking of a young William Shatner - possesses a pair of preternaturally aquamarine eyes so blindingly bright that when he meets his ocular match in Witherspoon ""This Means War"" looks like the Battle of the Baby Blues. Hardy the terrific British actor who brought such volcanic intensity to roles in ""Bronson"" and last years ""Warrior"" may not be able to compete with Pine in iris pigmentation but he more than makes up for that deficit with a pair of pillowy lips that would be too perfect were it not for the charming snaggle-toothed smile they conceal. Focusing on the considerable physical attributes of the stars isnt superficial but rather is the whole point when assessing ""This Means War"" which exists primarily to allow superior human specimens to prance and preen for the envy and vicarious wish-fulfillment of their fatter plainer fans. (And any superior physical specimen would do in a project reeking of rote one-from-column-A formula Reportedly Bradley Cooper James Franco Sam Worthington and Justin Timberlake were among the actors considered for Hardys and Pines roles.) The eye candy works to a point if viewers temporarily banish the need to believe for a second that any of these people would be romantically challenged let alone work as hot-dog super-spies or in Witherspoons case a consumer products tester. ""This Means War"" even has a few genuinely funny moments such as the visual gags that ensue when Hardys character - out to prove hes not a wimp - rampages through a paint-ball course with black-ops ferocity. But from its opening scene of a raid in Hong Kong to the romantic rivalry that transpires back home in Los Angeles ""This Means War"" proves to be little more than the canned Spam of the movie world - bland over-processed and cheap even when its spending millions engulfing highways in balls of ludicrous flame. Even Chelsea Handlers role as Witherspoons boozy bestie now seems unforgivably trite. Her jokes about ""mommys special milk"" and sneaking screwdrivers into sippy cups are about as edgy as a prime-time sitcom from 1999. The fact that ""This Means War"" is as graceless lazy and visually incoherent as it is can be laid squarely at the feet of its director McG the former music video director whose rsum includes the similarly manufactured ""Charlies Angels"" movies and ""Terminator Salvation."" His career at least provides a valuable reminder that the word ""hack"" didnt always refer to computer monkey-wrenchers. And his latest movie reminds filmgoers that February is above all the month dedicated to what the studios inelegantly refer to as The Dumps.

Or was it just a timing blunder? Given how its engineered as a formulaic date movie with a seemingly calculated blend of comedy eye candy and fast- paced action meant to please both sexes its hard to imagine.War offers a promising enough premise A pair of top CIA operatives Tuck (Tom Hardy) and FDR (Chris Pine) are partners and best pals who fall for the same woman. That would be Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) who evaluates consumer products for a living. While shes dithering and trying to decide between the swoon-worthy fellows they resort to sophisticated surveillance techniques and high-tech gadgets to spy on and best the other. Let the most devious man win.STORY Reese Witherspoon gets all kinds of action in WarVIDEO U.K. premiere of This Means WarHigh concept is made sporadically enjoyable by the affable chemistry of Pine and Hardy. Conversely what is meant to be convincing rapport between Lauren a girl-next-door type and her crass best buddy Trish (Chelsea Handler) falls flat. Silly action sequences grow tedious and rarely blend with the wannabe madcap comedy. Director McG (Charlies Angels) cant seem to decide whether hes making a spy action flick with romance interspersed or a rom-com peppered with action.About the movieThis Means War  out of fourStars Reese Witherspoon Chris Pine Tom Hardy Chelsea Handler DirectorMcGDistributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for sexual content including references some violence and action and for language Running time 1 hour 38 minutes Opens Friday nationwideThe story truly falls apart during a climactic extended chase sequence involving a Russian bad guy (Til Schweiger) who shows up early on but disappears for most of the movie. And the resolution of the torn-between-two-lovers tale seems more expedient than believable. This Means War isnt exactly hell but its far from heavenly.

Tuck (Tom Hardy) uses his formidable skills to woo Lauren (Reese Witherspoon in ""This Means War."" Photo Kimberley French Twentieth Century Fox This Means War review An unromantic uncomedy 1 / 5 Back to Gallery This Means War Romantic comedy. Starring Reese Witherspoon Chris Pine and Tom Hardy. Directed by McG. (PG-13. 98 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Reese Witherspoon isnt an idiot and yet she made ""This Means War"" which leads to the question Was this some temporary lapse in judgment or was this the best offer she had? And if the latter well thats something even worse than this movie ... except its hard to imagine anything worse than this movie. That ""This Means War"" is an ugly misguided exercise is apparent from the premise The story concerns a woman dating two men (Chris Pine and Tom Hardy) who unbeknownst to her are best friends. Also unbeknownst to her they are CIA agents using sophisticated technology each to get a leg up on the other. They tape her phone calls do extensive background checks and track her every move using hidden cameras and microphones. When one goes on a date with her the other sees it on a screen. Wow. Great guys huh? First the obvious What theyre doing is immoral and its also illegal. The CIA has no jurisdiction to conduct surveillance on American citizens. But just in practical terms it takes the star of the picture - Witherspoon - and makes her ridiculous. She is the only one in the movie and in the movie theater who has no idea whats going on in her personal life. We see her being manipulated by two clowns though from the movies point of view her only problem is having to choose between such wonderful men. At one point one of our young heroes finds out that she likes the paintings of Gustav Klimt so he takes her to see some Klimts and pretends to be a sensitive expert on Klimts oeuvre. The scene is not particularly funny but it gets a genuine dose of weird from the filmmakers lack of awareness - even a comic awareness - that this guy is doing something wrong that hes lying. Instead the scene is entirely focused on his success or failure. Will she buy the ruse or not? Its almost as if her believing in his sensitivity is as good as his being sensitive because it has the same result. Theres something off here. There is something off throughout. But then this was directed by McG a director whose action films have been notable for their emotional disconnectedness so you can imagine how this zombified sensibility would work in romantic comedy. In one scene the guys team up on a job and end up killing about a dozen people between them. They walk away unfazed - if anything theyre cheerful - and continue the afternoon pursuing romance. ""This Means War"" is a missive from a horrible place - a still-fictional country in which there is no such thing as privacy in which bullying is charming power is unchecked brutality is a form of sport and women are desperate. Theres no point in talking about the acting. Witherspoon Pine and Hardy arent playing people or even exaggerations of people but subhumans smiling veneers with physical needs and purchasing power but no souls. Heres an awful thought Maybe theyre not playing people from the future.

"This Means War Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies This Means War Witherspoon in the middle of spy vs. spy vs. sense  Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In ""This Means War""the CIA operatives played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy fall for the same woman a consumer products tester played by Reese Witherspoon. At first the boys agree to let the best agent win seduction-wise while Witherspoons Lauren puzzles through her feelings regarding her suitors whom she believes to be a cruise ship captain and a travel agent respectively.Then the lads alpha male surveillance instincts get the better of them and a sour premise becomes a pretty ugly state of affairs. Double-entendres about ""entering the premises"" litter the script. The fellows take turns foiling each others sexual progress in increasingly elaborate and James Bondian ways at immense expense to the American taxpayer. Their voyeuristic one-upmanship isnt amusing. Its more like none-upmanship. Occasionally the film lurches back to its B plot line involving an international arms dealer (Til Schweiger Sgt. Stiglitz of""Inglourious Basterds""). The bulk of the film the A plot rates an F.Thanks to the success seven years ago of ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and written by ""This Means War"" co-writer Simon Kinberg weve endured quite a few terrible ""Smith"" knockoffs in which assassins bullets fly while verbal bullets go squib-squib-squib all over the place. The ideal audience for ""This Means War"" is anybody who enjoyed ""Knight and Day""(the one with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz) and ""Killers"" (Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl). In the film press materials Witherspoon had this to say regarding her latest ""Its almost like two different movies. My characters in a comedy and Chris and Toms are in a big action film."" Yes and theyre both lame.Am I alone in resisting this subgenre of adorable assassins and their complicated love lives? Entertainments blending spiky comic repartee and outsize physical action (plus a formidable body count) tended to go down more easily in the Cold War days when Alfred Hitchcocks ""North by Northwest"" served as a prelude to the Bond franchise and a diversion such as Stanley Donens ""Charade"" could disarm moviegoers who had come for Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn and as such found themselves pleasantly discombobulated by all the killings.""This Means War"" is pure witless discombobulation. The director is McG of the ""Charlies Angels"" franchise and ""We Are Marshall."" (He should shorten that handle of his either to ""Mc"" or just plain ""G."") He choreographs and frames the action here in such a way as to be spatially incoherent -- as in the Hong Kong-set prelude -- or tonally berserk -- as in a later massively destructive clash between the male leads. In the Tom Arnold ""True Lies"" supporting slot Chelsea Handler (as Laurens kibitzing married friend Trish) offers smutty wisecracks a-plenty if not a-funny enough to risk thePG-13 rating; it took two appeals in fact to rate the film down from an R.The superbright color palette is designed for high spirits but the behavior of the alleged rooting interests is repellent especially Pines smug Lothario. Repartee does not come easily to the hugely talented Hardy who always seems on the verge of a bloodbath. And note to Witherspoon ""This Means War"" is the sort of consumer product youre supposed to test before you win an Academy Award not after.mjphillipstribune.comThis Means War -- 1 starMPAA rating PG-13 (for some sexual content including references some violence and action and for language)Running time 136Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Action (Movie Genre) Entertainment Movies Unrest Conflicts and War This Means War (movie) Reese Witherspoon Killers (movie) 10 best movies of 2011 This Means War Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising77deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0214-this-means-war-20120216,0,5985505.column",200,thismeanswar15,thismeanswar,chicagotribune

More about This Means War >> Yet to cast him in a romantic comedy even one with as much physical action as This Means War is like trying to tickle your lover with paintball grenades. Hardy is raffishly charming. But you dont send a grenade to do a feathers job. Which is exactly the mistake that McG director of this earsplitting hyperbolic love triangle makes. Again and again this comedy cowritten by the author of Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Sherlock Holmes fires projectiles larger than its target. The objective is thimble-size Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) a lovelorn products tester. Two CIA agents best buds pursue her romantically. The unfunny joke is that they spy on each others dates as they might on a terrorists activities. Hardy is Agent Tuck. Chris Pine is Agent FDR. Thats right as in the New Deal president. And they are as codependent as Holmes and Watson. Best remembered as the overconfident Kirk in the Star Trek reboot and as the conductor of the runaway train in Unstoppable Pine would not be able to keep up with Hardy in a shooting range or boxing ring. But as FDR who runs into Lauren in a video store (they still have those?) right after her blind date with Tuck Pine keeps Hardy on the ropes. McG auteur of the Charlies Angels films is not blessed with finesse. He amps up the decibel level and whenever possible films his characters in vehicles that exceed not just the speed limit but engine capacity. The result is a calculated date movie that aims low but provides the basic movie pleasure of seeing good-looking people looking good. Theres action and male competition enough to satisfy the connoisseurs of beer ads. And there are two hunky guys for its smart-mouthed heroine to choose between furnishing fantasy fodder both for women and men who love men. Witherspoon has at least two scenes that show how fast-thinking Lauren is. She is confident enough to costar with actors who are as pretty as she is. Its amusing to watch an actress the scale of a Chihuahua as she playfully spars with costars the sizes of a Rottweiler and a Greyhound. Despite the title of the film the best friends dont declare war on each other. Theirs is a mostly amicable if often bruising competition as to who is the better romantic fit for Lauren. The films focus on the contest between the two agents does throw the film off-balance. Chelsea Handler is on hand as Laurens best friend and sounding board a sunshiny killjoy whos both wistful and acerbic. Although her presence rebalances the film War is a bromantic comedy tricked out in the clothes of a romantic one.

Their friendship is strained when they fall for the same woman. Kimberley French/20th Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Kimberley French/20th Century Fox This Means War Director McG Genre Action Romantic Comedy Running Time 98 minutes Rated R for some sexual content With Reese Witherspoon Chris Pine Tom Hardy Chelsea Handler Watch Clips From This Means War - Gentlemen Gentlemen Credit 20th Century Fox From This Means War - Interference Interference Credit 20th Century Fox From This Means War - Safe Safe Credit 20th Century Fox ""Youre not good at lying"" says FDR Foster to his best buddy Tuck in This Means War. Hes right The heavily muscled tattooed tough guy is really a teddy bear who wears his heart on his sleeve and his true feelings all over his face. Its that earnestness that immediately makes Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) fall for Tuck (Tom Hardy) when theyre on a first date. FDR (Chris Pine) falls for her later the same day and the two meatheads spend the rest of the film competing for her affections -- while callously lying to her and almost as an afterthought putting all of their lives in danger. Life and death are in play because FDR and Tuck just happen to be highly trained highly dangerous CIA agents -- which ought to be a problem given not only that Tuck is a terrible liar but that the two generally arent very good at much of anything apart from looking dapper and beating people up. But never mind because in the cartoonish universe of This Means War general idiocy isnt really seen as a liability. Thats a notion that applies as much to the agents themselves as it does to the blindingly unfunny script. Their general ineptitude could have worked if director McG had wanted to make the film a self-conscious parody -- spy movie cliches in service to a romantic comedy. Indeed in an earlier vision of the project Seth Rogen was to star in the film; throwing him and say a Jonah Hill into the leads could have lent this the tone of a 21st-century Spies Like Us. And in the films opening minutes it feels as if that might be the desired effect Its loaded with overblown action chestnuts like from-the-hip gunplay people dangling from the sides of skyscrapers and a gruff commanding officer. (That would be Angela Bassett who shows up periodically to growl at her charges in a role that might have been hilarious had anyone thought to write anything legitimately funny for her.) But a good parody takes a finesse that isnt in the vocabulary of McG a bargain-basement Michael Bay more concerned with cool than coherence. Instead we get utter nonsense like a video store with a database that conveniently includes customer photos for the CIA to tap into. (Related These characters are in 2012 going to a video store?) Damsel Distressed Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) is caught between the two who compete for her affection chiefly by sabotaging each others dates using expensive U.S. government resources. Kimberley French/20th Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Kimberley French/20th Century Fox In another scene FDR wrestles on the floor with a small dog that has just attacked him as Lauren stands 5 feet away oblivious. The Farrelly brothers should sue the producers not for stealing the scene outright from Theres Something About Mary but for imitating it so badly. Elsewhere they attempt a riff on Cyrano by having FDR wax academic about the work of Laurens favorite artist Gustav Klimt while being fed the lines via an earpiece. The mystery of how he managed to get the original canvas of The Kiss to a storeroom in Los Angeles from its gallery home in Austria is never broached. All the while FDR and Tuck are burning through thousands of dollars in CIA surveillance resources and manpower to one-up each other while largely ignoring the case theyre ostensibly working on. But no matter since McG largely ignores that subplot as well -- at least until he needs it to facilitate the films big action finale. Comedy often requires that actors be willing to look foolish in service of a gag. All the performers seem more than game -- even Hardy who would seem to be the odd man out here; hes a superb and chameleonic dramatic actor trying his hand at silly comedy for the first time. But with the material theyre given they mostly just seem foolish for showing up to the movie to begin with. Audiences would do well to avoid the same mistake.

It features a competition between a lonely divorced dad (Tom Hardy) and a loudmouthed Lothario (Chris Pine) over a woman (Reese Witherspoon) who has no idea that they are best friends or that they are CIA agents. This Means War is a romantic comedy thats been dressed up in the manner of the much better Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith to look like an action flick presumably to persuade men that they wont be emasculated by seeing it on date night. But if last weekends The Vow represents complete surrender This Means War represents a gloomy compromise; no one who sees it will emerge victorious. Directed by McG This Means War is lit like an advertisement for a cruise line all harsh candy colors in daylight various shades of neon at night and garish 24/7. Both Hardy who plays gentle Tuck and Pine as Tucks partner Franklin (a.k.a. FDR) are good looking men but in this hyper saturated color and lighting scheme youd barely know it. With his eerily bright blue eyes and expansive forehead Pine looks like an alien. Director McG (Terminator Salvation Charlies Angels) fails the first rule of romantic comedies make sure everyone but the best friends look pretty. (MORE Vote in TIMEs BEST Best Picture Tournament) He opens the film with Tuck and FDR on a mission that ends with tons of dead bodies but without them having captured their hissing German target Heinrich (Til Schweiger). The botched operation is dramatically dead -- who cares if Heinrich shows up again? -- and serves the sole purpose of getting Tuck and FDR grounded in the CIAs spacious improbably slick Los Angeles office where Tuck now has the time to try Internet dating. As luck would have it cranky hausfrau Trish (Chelsea Handler) has just posted her lovelorn best friend Laurens (Witherspoon) profile loading it with trashy photos. ""Men are going to respond to that camel toe"" Trish assures the milquetoast Lauren. Soon both men are vying for Laurens affections although affection seems a pliable concept in FDRs world. He is as Lauren points out during their first accidental encounter at a video store ""a one-day rental kind of guy.""  (She also scolds him for recommending she go home with Hitchcocks The Lady Vanishes when as she knows Vertigo Notorious and Rebecca are all better. Embedded in there is a clue as to which of the two Lauren will end up with.) On her first date with Tuck he takes her to a carnival and entices her into trying out the trapeze with him which looks like a lot of fun. On her first date with FDR he takes her to a club filled with women dressed like hookers. With just about the only flash of that trademark Witherspoon crispness Lauren denounces him as a club rat and flees. Good sense indicates that Laurens dating dilemma has been resolved but the movie continues to tease the possibility that Pines bad boy is as much a viable and interested suitor as Hardys wholly sexy good man (he makes a surprisingly relaxed leading man). She ping pongs between them encouraged by Trish with both men using their CIA resources to spy on her. ""Patriot Act"" one of them says when someone points out the privacy issues. Although it is veiled by a seemingly progressive outlook for a mainstream romantic comedy -- namely that a woman can sample the wares of various men before making her choice -- the movie is filled with casual misogyny. While Lauren makes judgments for a living heading a consumer products testing agency shes addled about this choice. Watching and listening by hidden cameras and microphones as Lauren and Trish debate the relative merits of Tuck vs. FDR a mystified FDR asks ""Why is she listening to that old man?"" Handlers character with her multiple small children may be a little too tired to be a proper MILF but the guy who refers to her as an ""old man"" is not the guy any nice girl like Lauren should settle down with. But This Means War has a terrible sense of chemistry all the way around. Even the pairing of Witherspoon and Handler which has on paper an undeniable allure (ladylike Oscar winner hanging with foul-mouthed late night comedy queen) turns out to be a dud. Handler is a sly crude pleasure on her mischievous talk show but playing a ""domestic goddess"" in the mold of Roseanne Barr she spits out her lines mechanically without varying her tone of sour resentment. She seems miserable. But the one to worry about is Reese Witherspoon. What is the compulsively watchable star of Freeway Election Legally Blonde and Walk the Line doing in immature garbage like this?

Comments click to enlarge This Means War Video Rated PG-13  97 minutes  2012 After the miserable Terminator Salvation (2009) action director Joseph McGinty Nichol--thats McG to you--returns to the formula of his Charlies Angels movies easygoing comedy punctuated by acrobatic stunts gun duels and the like. Chris Pine and Tom Hardy are best-pal CIA agents who both fall for Reese Witherspoon and begin surveilling and sabotaging each others dates backed by every high-tech resource our taxpayer dollars can provide (thats the funniest aspect of the story though McG wont go near it). Pine who expertly impersonated William Shatner in the Star Trek reboot seems to have picked up some of the actors air of self-serious buffoonery and it suits him well; as Witherspoons best pal late-night TV comedian Chelsea Handler holds down what might be called the Nora Ephron part dispensing an endless stream of bawdy man jokes.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Kimberley French) One man is too hot. One man is too cold. What should poor Goldilocks do?In the grim fairy tale ""This Means War"" the perky princess makes two suitors do a song and dance for her unaware that theyre frenemy secret agents whove been wrestling in the bear pit since they met her. Disguised as a romantic comedy this is a toxic triangle where the only satisfying outcome would be mutual annihilation.Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) is a marketing researcher who doesnt know the secret formula for attracting a good man. After her slutty friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) places a personals ad on Laurens behalf it elicits a promising response from chivalrous single dad Tuck (Tom Hardy). But almost simultaneously Lauren catches the roving eye of Tucks tomcatting comrade Franklin (Chris Pine). When the inseparable CIA agents learn that theyre stalking the same prey they agree to let the best man win. Yet an insurmountable problem of the movie is that neither the sleazy Franklin nor the sensitive Tuck turns out to be an especially good man.Operating on the assumption that alls fair in love and war they behave like dirty rotten scoundrels diverting agency resources to spy on Lauren and sabotage the competition -- while a terrorist (Til Schweiger) is gunning for both of them.And then even Lauren whom Witherspoon imbues with a likability thats been lacking in her last several roles turns trashy deciding that the men will unwittingly compete in ""a sex tiebreaker."" With its bawdy bachelorettes and bickering buddies this creaky hybrid of a chick flick and a bromance smells like it was designed by one of the heroines focus groups. Director McG (""Charlies Angels"") reportedly shot multiple endings before choosing one that is noisy and nonsensical.Even by the standards of light entertainment ""This Means War"" is meaningless.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Like some chilling Orwellian vision--or a three-episode marathon of MTVs Next--This Means War sets a frothy romantic comedy in a surveillance state following two CIA operatives who use the agencys full resources to score the same woman. Its a victory for the PATRIOT Act that such a movie could ever exist banking as it does on the assumption that were perfectly fine with forfeiting our right to privacy so long as the guys invading that privacy are hot. Given the creepiest rom-com premise this side of Addicted To Love--which at least had the wisdom to reflect on its camera-obscura voyeurism--director McG tries to turn This Means War into a cool pop confection along the lines of his Charlies Angels movies. But pouring on the douchey hipness and charm only makes things worse. Forced to squander their considerable charisma Chris Pine Tom Hardy and Reese Witherspoon play three corners of a romantic triangle all hard-working professionals who have trouble meeting people on the side. When Hardy meets Witherspoon a go-getting product-tester on an online dating site he allows his CIA partner Pine to hang out at a nearby video store during their first date. Of course Witherspoon and Pine just happen to meet up independently of Hardy and they hit it off leading Witherspoon into the dilemma of dating two guys at once and leaving Pine and Hardy competing for the same woman. In an effort to get information about Witherspoons likes and dislikes--and to monitor each others progress in rounding the proverbial bases--the guys install various bugs hidden cameras and tracking devices as if she were in a terrorist sleeper cell. Theres a lot of intelligence-gathering in This Means War which usually involves Pine or Hardy and a group of other men clustering around a monitor while Witherspoon frets and Chelsea Handler as her married confidant turns her every worry into a smutty one-liner. Scenes of the guys applying the things theyve learned about Witherspoon on their dates--taking her to see Gustav Klimt paintings or adopting a dog--smack of Bill Murray wooing Andie MacDowell in Groundhog Day. But the crucial difference is that Murray had no choice but to relive the same day over and over again; Pine and Hardy have the choice not to be invasive creeps. They and the movie just dont see the problem with it. For thoughts on and a place to discuss plot details not talked about in this review visit This Means Wars Spoiler Space.

This Means War Bad to fair Director McG. Cast Reese Witherspoon Chris Pine Tom Hardy. Rating PG-13 for some sexual content. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Reese Witherspoon Spy movies Or maybe its just not a very good movie. Oh its OK but you would think that with Reese Witherspoon Chris Pine and Tom Hardy on board for a romantic comedy some sparks would fly. They dont unless you count the acerbic asides uttered by Chelsea Handler as Witherspoons best friend. These are all nice people to look at great in some of their movies but set adrift by McGs direction and a sloppy screenplay here. Pine and Hardy play FDR and Tuck respectively two CIA operatives who are also best friends. But after a sort of James Bond-light mission in Hong Kong in which they are supposed to bring in bad guy Heinrich (Til Schweiger) in clandestine fashion goes loudly awry they are given some time to cool off. FDR is a ladies man while Tuck is separated from his wife (Abigail Spencer) with whom he has a son. They decide to work on finding Tuck a girlfriend or at least maybe a date. 10 romantic-triangle movies An online dating service pairs Tuck and Lauren (Witherspoon) a beautiful successful woman who naturally in the grand romantic-comedy tradition cannot get a date. They hit it off at lunch but take things slowly. She walks to a video store nearby and as fate would have it reaches for the same movie that FDR has chosen. Witty banter ensues (as opposed to the more early stage lovey-dovey patter she had with Tuck). These guys being spies it doesnt take long thanks to illegal surveillance on both their parts for them to figure out that they are dating the same woman. They agree to a competition. They will both court Lauren and she -- not knowing about the contest -- will choose the man most right for her. Of course they also throw the services and manpower of the CIA into invading her privacy with cameras hidden microphones the odd raid on a cozy moment on the couch etc. Meanwhile Heinrich who has sworn revenge on FDR and Tuck makes his way to the U.S. However ""meanwhile"" implies that this is an actual subplot. In reality the Heinrich business just pops up here and there as if to remind us that these guys have jobs and what they are. A screwball romantic comedy certainly does not have to adhere to realism but this stretches things too far. Lauren likes both men and cant really choose between them despite lots of advice from her friend Trish (Handler) who is married and has children the pressures of which she deals with in amusing ways (screwdrivers in the sippy cup being a particularly nice touch -- for her not the kid). Hardy is a great actor searing in ""Bronson"" tremendous in ""Warrior"" and the new bad guy in the upcoming Batman movie. Pine was really good as James T. Kirk in the ""Star Trek"" reboot. Witherspoon of course is an Oscar-winning delight able to play drama or comedy. Individually they are all good here though Hardys skills dont necessarily translate that well to romantic comedy -- which could have been used to good effect but McG doesnt have the touch to pull that off. But overall theyre just not given the right things to do. Even Cupid misfires occasionally. At least with these actors we know there will be a next time.

"This Means War | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; this-means-war ) This Means War (United States 2012) February 15 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Sometimes its hard to recognize the importance of seemingly inconsequential element like ""tone"" when it comes to a romantic comedy. This Means War is a case study in what happens when the filmmakers mess this up. The movie is being marketed as an ""action romantic comedy"" but the ""action"" aspect is really just a little flavoring that shows up at the beginning and the end. Its jokey action - a would-be parody of over-the-top spy situations like those in Bond movies and the recent Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol. But its clumsily presented generating neither excitement nor humor. At the heart of the movie is a romantic triangle between three impossibly good-looking people who are so uninteresting that we keep hoping the sleazy bad guy will show up and shoot them all. Maybe Im being unreasonable. Maybe Im asking too much that a romantic comedy makes me feel something other than apathy. Maybe its wrong of me to hope the most sympathetic character ends up with more than a throw-in consolation prize. I cant say whether the biggest problem with This Means War lies in the direction the acting or the screenplay but all three elements are contributors. Romantic comedies especially those that overdose on steroids are supposed to uplift. This one is just depressing. FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) are elite spies with a history of getting the job done in the messiest way possible. After a failed attempt to capture international terrorist Heinrich (Til Schweiger) goes awry leaving mayhem destruction and dead bodies all over FDR and Tuck are assigned desk jobs. Heinrich meanwhile plots revenge since one of those dead bodies belongs to his brother. Back at Spy Central Tuck decides its time for him to get back into the dating scene. He signs up with an on-line agency and presto he has a date with Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) a thirtysomething woman so devoted to her job that she doesnt have room in her life for a pet. Tuck and Lauren have a great first date but after its over she accidentally bumps into FDR (Chris Pine) and after a rocky getting-to-know-you period they too are going out. It doesnt take long for Tuck and FDR to discern theyre after the same woman although shes clueless that theyre best friends. They make a pact not to let Lauren come between them but of course thats a deal they are unable to keep. Theres not a lot of chemistry between Tom Hardy and Reese Witherspoon and even less between Witherspoon and Chris Pine. There are moments when Pine and Witherspoon generate something close to sexual tension but the Hardy/Witherspoon vibe is more of the ""best friends"" variety. The element that fractures This Means War however is the friendship between Pine and Hardys characters. These two are supposed to be as close at two non-gay guys can be. Yet theres a chill that never thaws. A good romantic triangle where friends vie for the same woman demands that we believe in the bond between the men and it doesnt happen here. Director McG who should sign a cross-promotional deal with the Golden Arches is more concerned about the films ""coolness"" factor than he is about character interaction. Theres a clever little scene in which FDR and Tuck sneak around Laurens apartment planting bugs while she prances and dances through the rooms. There are a lot of surveillance shots as Tuck spies on FDRs dates and vice versa. And the beginning and end are chock full of gunshots explosions car crashes and dead bodies. McGs style here is more akin to the one he used for Charlies Angels than We Are Marshall. Reese Witherspoon comes to This Means War with her days as Hollywoods highest paid actress well behind her. She has plenty of charisma but its mostly wasted here. And her character has somehow been given the moral high ground despite the fact shes dating two guys behind each others back and intends to sleep with both to decide which one is the ""keeper."" The two male leads both of whom have Star Trek connections are intended to be an odd couple. Tom Hardy despite having played some hard-asses in recent movies (Warrior for example) is meek and low-key here - qualities that at times are ill-fitting. Meanwhile Chris Pine appears to have tweaked his James T. Kirk persona by upping the asshole quotient. The standout is not one of the leads - its Chelsea Handler who plays Laurens obligatory Best Friend. She has all the best lines and its immediately apparent that This Means War would have been a lot better if her role had been enhanced. Some will undoubtedly be satisfied by the way things are resolved. I found the wrap-up to be semisweet at best although perhaps not as unpalatable as if I had been more invested in the characters and their relationships. The ""consolation prize"" I mentioned earlier is more of an insult than a good way to provide closure and although it doesnt come completely out of left field it has been shoehorned in for maximum happy ending impact. This Means War is not funny enough to succeed as a comedy. Its not emotionally deft enough to succeed as a romance. And its not exciting enough to succeed as an action film. Its a high-energy fast-paced explosion of moments that can be edited together to make a compelling trailer. With a nod to McGs background it looks and feels like a 98-minute music video without the music - all splash and little heart. A lot of romantic comedies fail because theyre too saccharine. This Means War could have used a little more of that.

This movie will self destruct in ... By Rex Reed  02/14/12 808pm Pine and Hardy contemplating why exactly they are fighting for Witherspoon. More secret agents appear in a pharmacologically induced state of general anesthesia called This Means War. A hack called simply McG who perpetrated on the world such forgettable trash wallows as two idiotic Charlies Angels movies and Terminator Salvation is hardly the professional you want around to monitor the dosage. The result is 98 minutes of moronic stupidity already being labeled on the Internet as ""the worst movie of the year."" A premature assessment? Maybe. Its only February. But after This Means War one thing is certain The year has nowhere to go but up. Tuck (Tom Hardy the tattooed Muscle McGurk from England who surprised everybody in Warrior) and FDR (Chris Pine) are best buds and inseparable partners who throw people off the roofs of buildings smash up cities and declare war on entire enemy nations. Nothing can come between them including the CIA database which they use illegally to research girls. Nothing that is until they fall for the same girl a motor mouth product researcher whatever that is played by the once-discriminating but no longer fresh or versatile Reese Witherspoon. Suddenly its a fight to the double bed to see which one wears Brut and which one wears patchouli. Using top-secret classified files and video-surveillance equipment at the CIA field office in Los Angeles they break every law to spy on each other right up to and including in Ms. Witherspoons bedroom. One pretends to be a travel agent. The other passes himself off as a ships captain. And shes dumb enough to believe them both. Its not clear which one she will choose after a night in the Porthault linen but you get a good idea when she tells her sluttish nymphomaniac girlfriend about Mr. Pine ""Four in one night"" Shes talking orgasms not tequila shots. As CIA operatives Mr. Hardy and Mr. Pine have all the credibility of Abbott and Costello. For two-thirds of the movie nothing happens to write home about. Then just when the movie is gasping its final death rattle the international assassin whose brother was killed on one of their bungled missions in Hong Kong arrives and the three stars spend the rest of the running time doing just that--running smashing up the freeway destroying cars and public property blowing up trucks and helicopters and ... but why go on? If undercover spies for the CIA spend every waking hour of the day and night using government property to act like imbeciles I shudder to think what Homeland Security will do to protect the country in an emergency. I know this is a desperate farce without a laugh in sight but the movie is dead on arrival and not even Ms. Witherspoon can save it. It is however high time she started thinking about saving herself--and whats left of her film career. rreedobserver.com THIS MEANS WAR Running Time 98 minutes Written by Timothy Dowling and Simon Kinberg Directed by McG Starring Reese Witherspoon Chris Pine and Tom Hardy 0/4 Comment Filed under Chris Pine CIA Espionage Love Triangle McG movie Movie Review Reese Witherspoon Secret Agents Tom Hardy Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2012/02/this-means-war-has-been-compromised/,200,thismeanswar29,thismeanswar,observer

Photo 20th Century Fox Licensing/Merch Slap Witherspoon -- and Chris Pine -- with a Reese and desist order for making this flick. (20th Century Fox) Nothing says Valentines Day like watching a couple of CIA agents preparing to torture a suspected terrorist with a pair of pliers right? Unless its the buff heroes of director McGs spectacularly awful new action comedy ""This Means War -- played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy -- watching each other woo Reese Witherspoon on video surveillance screens. Nearly totally laugh- chemistry- and coherence-free this fiasco from the director of ""Charlies Angels Full Throttle has a script whose sensible parts would fit on a napkin with enough room left over for the Gettysburg Address. PHOTOS REESE WITHERSPOONS LEADING MEN Its set in an alternate universe where 30-something CIA agents use words like ""hanky-panky and have to resort to online dating services to get a little action. Tuck (Hardy) is instantly -- and somewhat mysteriously -- smitten with Lauren (Witherspoon) an uptight product tester whose randy married BFF (Chelsea Handler) has signed her up for the same dating service behind her back. But then Tucks partner FDR (Pine) is also hot for her even if he has a strange way of showing it sometimes. ""Go back to the retirement village the 31-year-old actors character tells Lauren who is being played by a 35-year-old. Perhaps FDR is confused (a sentiment sure to be shared by the audience) because Witherspoon seems to be dressed in Kmarts unflattering Aging Oscar Winner Collection or because the studio has apparently neglected to provide her with the services of a hairdresser to deal with her flyaway locks. Witherspoon suddenly sports dangling earrings in the middle of one scene and the guys have wounds that dont match from scene to scene in a flick so riddled with continuity errors it will earn a special place on moviemistakes.com. These manifold technical errors -- even the action-sequence shots seem to have been edited with a roulette wheel -- wouldnt matter so much if either of the actors looked plausible with Witherspoon a talented actress whos required by the script to act like someone 10 years her junior. Or for the movies target audience if someone had remembered to ask the actors to take their shirts off. For a movie called ""This Means War even the male stars climactic fisticuffs looks like an afterthought. But this is a movie full of such expensive-looking head-scratchers including sequences where our government-employee heroes try to impress Lauren (who thinks Tuck is a travel agent and FDR a cruise-ship captain) with their access to a full-scale trapeze and the complete works of Gustav Klimt. Its a film riddled with scenes that set up other scenes that appear to have been deleted. (Ms. Handlers unfunny smutty remarks were trimmed to avoid an R rating. ) Angela Bassett who plays the guys boss disappears midway -- was her character abducted or did the actress simply quit in disgust? No ""True Lies or even Mr. and Mrs. Smith (it shares a writer with the latter) this rom-com bomb even resorts to the desperate but rarely successful narrative strategy of referencing earlier better movies like ""Titanic. In a scene set in the kind of big video store that disappeared years ago FDR tells Lauren that Alfred Hitchcocks ""The Lady Vanishes is "" sort of a second-tier title. To what tier of romantic comedies does ""This Means War belong? Youd have to start at zero and work your way down. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Tennis serves an ace Read Next Tennis serves an ace Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 43710 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 28221 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17148 Braves Brian McCann interest may pave way for Gary Sanchez Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

The contested objective is Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) a product tester who decides to apply comparative shopping techniques to dating. Her would-be beaus FDR (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) are best friends who sit across from each other at work. The hook is that their desks are in the slate-colored guts of the CIAs Los Angeles field office--and that the boys will put the agencys entire arsenal to work in their pursuit.Tuck has a seven-year-old son and an ex-wife and is now shy in love; FDR is a Don Juan who knows every club doorman in town and who finds more than his match in Lauren a woman ready to inform him when hes grossly overestimating the effect of the twinkle in his eye.The cocky presumption of charm that isnt actually there is precisely the problem with action-comedy This Means War Its a movie that acts straightaway like it has an audience eating out of its hand while neglecting to do anything surprising or delightful to actually seduce that audience.The problem is not the cast exactly. In the office Hardy does some funny passive-aggressive business with his keyboard his nattering put-down rapport with Pine sometimes threatens almost to mesh and Witherspoon remains one of our most game least vain comediennes. The premise--two men abusing their access to billions of dollars of spy tech to pursue a woman--is novel even potentially promising as a satire of dating in the online-intel era with FDR and Tuck customizing their approach to Laurens interests while anticipating and adapting their pitches to her every complaint gathered in surveillance of Laurens girl-talk sessions with pal Chelsea Handler. But aside from the high-concept novelty This Means War prefers to keep things as familiar as possible at every opportunity so as not to disorient the most timid paying customer. By the time the line ""Was this some kind of bet?"" arrives its clear that this is timetable script writing with confrontation coming right on schedule.The familiarity of the material extends to Laurens decision between the well-oiled ladies man and the solid dependable type. Quite recently Witherspoon was looking at the same choice in How Do You Know. But where James L. Brookss great humane film searched out emotional individuality within Owen Wilson and Paul Rudds bad-boy/nice-guy archetypes This Means Wars temperamentally shallow director McG deals strictly in readymades. (Not surprising Terminator Salvation McGs last movie and an attempt to rebrand himself as a director of dark and serious material was a magpies gathering of post-apocalyptic tropes without one iota of invention.)McG who began as a director of some of the most loathsome music videos of the 1990s (Sugar Ray Smash Mouth ""Pretty Fly [For a White Guy]""--the sort of stuff that calls for a VIP circle in hell) uses music like speed a quick bump to give a scene energy (like the sequence in Laurens apartment where FDR and Tuck slink around planting bugs just out of her sight as she obliviously bops to Montell Jordans ""This Is How We Do It""). His directorial m.o. has never evolved past trying to make every scene ""pop""; consequently hes much more comfortable crosscutting between control-room antics and date nights than digging into the intimate moments. But such constant coercive insistence on what a rollicking good time were having is inevitably smothering and by the time an extended epilogue brings back the characters that youve presumably fallen in love with for a curtain call it only works as a chance for a head start to the parking lot.By the law of rom-coms FDR is ripe for comeuppance for assuming he can put the same lines over on every girl--but This Means War assumes the same an audience that will always react to the same button-pushing emotional and musical cues like Pavlovs dogs. This arrogance is the difference between crowd-pleasing and pandering.

"This Means War A bromantic comedy |       NJ.com comments This Means War A bromantic comedy Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 14 2012 at 719 AM View/Post Comments Twentieth Century FoxDespite the handshake and smiles itas all out war between best pals Tuck (Tom Hardy left) and FDR (Chris Pine) who are battling over the woman (Reese Witherspoon) for whom theyave both fallen. ""This Means War"" is a romantic action comedy with Chris Pine and Tom Hardy as globe-trotting spies and Reese Witherspoon as the woman theyre both in love with. And as befits a film previewing on Valentines Day -- its regular engagement begins Friday -- it is full of longing looks tender touches and deep professions of eternal love. Unfortunately they all pass between Pine and Hardy. There are many things that you need for a successful heterosexual romantic comedy but youd think one of the most important would be at least a slight interest in women. In ""This Means War"" though Witherspoon is practically an afterthought the Kewpie Doll prize that both of these chuckleheads are determined to win at any cost. At any cost that is except their friendship which -- as they incessantly declare -- is the most important thing in the world because I love you man really I love you. Oh get a room. Witherspoon is plucky and probably needs to be after her last couple of movies. Although she won an Oscar for ""Walk the Line"" rom-coms pay her bills and if taking parts like this keep her in the game she seems willing to go for it. But theres something a little embarrassing about seeing her play such a disposable character. And something more than a little creepy about a plot that has these two men separately videotaping even her most intimate moments. ""Isnt this against the Constitution?"" one of their assistants asks as they prepare to spy on her having sex. ""Patriot Act"" the spy blithely replies. No more like stalking and voyeurism -- and not exactly a fun plot twist for a movie being sold as a date-night picture. Treated even worse is Chelsea Handler playing Witherspoons pal. Shes gotten a lot of mileage out of her drunken pick-up jokes but the movie goes out of its way to make the mileage show having her drive around swilling booze out of her kids sippy cup and photographing her so harshly one of the spies refers to her as ""that old man."" This is a romantic comedy? Well this is McG at any rate the mono-monikered ""sensation"" who gave us those two awful ""Charlies Angels"" films and then in 2009 rebooted one of Hollywoods most valuable properties right into the scrap heap with the tinny ""Terminator Salvation."" And now hes back with this and all his favorite obsessions Blond women dancing around in their underwear big hunks of metal crashing into each other and big lunks of maleness crashing into the furniture -- filmed really crisply and set to pounding music. But this isnt a romantic comedy. This is two dopey kids tussling at the family dinner table with Reese Witherspoon as the wishbone theyre fighting over. Whoever wins she loses. And anyone who still thinks this sounds like a great first date movie isnt going to have to worry about what movie to see for the second. Ratings note The film contains violence sexual situations and strong language. This Means War (PG-13) Fox (98 min.) Directed by McG. With Reese Witherspoon Chris Pine Tom Hardy. Now playing in New Jersey for one day only; regular performances resume Friday.

Two spies vie for a womans attention. Director McG (138). PG-13 Violence language sexuality. At area theaters. Whats sexier than a man who tells a woman that shes ""uptight"" and a ""judgmental princess"" or shushes her and demands ""no more thinking"" when she tries to talk to him? Nothing according to director McG. There is a good guy in his action comedy ""This Means War"" but the nicer Tuck (Tom Hardy) is consistently emasculated even as McG celebrates walking beer ad FDR (Chris Pine). The two buddies are movie-style superspies meaning they fly around the world flirting with gorgeous women and casually taking out villains like the mysterious Heinrich (Til Schweiger underused). Tuck however is ready to settle down which leads him to dinner with Lauren (Reese Witherspoon). Things go well but immediately afterward she meets FDR and agrees to go out with him too. Laurens best friend (Chelsea Handler) encourages her to date both guys in order to choose the right one. Soon the men are competing for her affections by lying to her breaking into her house secretly videotaping her and doing all sorts of other creepy things apparently meant to be hilarious. The kind of rom-com that insults its primary audience and panders to their dates ""War"" is depressingly mean-spirited. (At one point the ill-lit Handler is referred to as an ""old man."") Hardy is in a class by himself here not only because hes so charismatic but because Pines one-note portrayal of a player is so unappealing. Witherspoon seems most comfortable when presenting Lauren as a sharp businesswomen but shes constantly forced to act like an insecure teen. On the plus side theres no denying all three leads are easy on the eyes. And while the action scenes are underwritten and preposterously staged they look good too. Just like FDR the whole thing is slick and handsome and rotten at the core. Magic moment A wild chase seems destined for a dangerous dead end.

"This Means War review Bromance conquers all - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesThis Means War review Bromance conquers allThis Means War review Reese Witherspoons Lauren is the object of the affections of friends played by Chris Pine and Tom Hardy. But the bromance is what sizzles.February 14 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Tom Hardy Reese Witherspoon and Chris Pine star in ""This Means War."" (Kimberley French / 20th...)Its a hit-and-miss affair as CIA agents/BFFs Chris Pine and Tom Hardy launch highly targeted competing covert love-ops in ""This Means War"" both aiming for the heart of a consumer products tester played by Reese Witherspoon. Smart blond beautiful but unable to get a guy Witherspoons Lauren Scott is as perky and perfect as she seems but this lovely is not what gives the movie its kick. So if you are in the mood for action there is a whole lot of it here. If youre in the mood for love of the swooning weak-in-the knees sort theres not so much. But this is war after all a bromance not a romance muscle not mush. The relationship that truly sizzles a from the sentiment to the satire a is the one between FDR (Pine) and Tuck (Hardy) with Pine and Hardy pulling off one of the better bromances in recent memory. Its not as if director McG who was behind the lethally dark drizzle of 2009s ""Terminator Salvation"" has gone soft. He has just injected a razzle-dazzle romance into a high-octane high-tech action flick in which guns and hearts are pretty much blazing 24/7. This is McGs slickest film yet with slight echoes of the kind of male bonding he explored more seriously in the drama of ""We Are Marshall"" in 2006. It is also his fastest moving averaging about 120 mph the better to bypass the potholes in the plot with veteran director of photography Russell Carpenter (""Titanic"" and ""True Lies"" among others) knowing when to go in for the romantic close-ups and when to pull back for the action shocks. The sparks begin when Laurens best friend Trish a potty-mouthed mom played by Chelsea Handler basically doing her Chelsea Handler-brand of female raunch decides to take Laurens love life into her own hands posting a racy page on a dating site. A few continents away Tuck and FDR are on assignment a a James Bond-styled operation that lands them in a lux penthouse party looking for a bad guy named Heinrich (Til Schweiger) and involves a great deal of roof-top hanging out and hair-raising derring-do. Back home in L.A. and grounded for all the ways the Heinrich affair went wrong single-dad Tuck decides to try finding a soul mate online. Laurens profile is discovered and a date is set with FDR stationed nearby in case an emergency extraction is necessary. A chance encounter changes the plan and the competition for Lauren that will drive the rest of the film is set in motion. The cameras the wiretaps the tracking devices and the two competing CIA crews that Tuck and FDR enlist to help them chart every move Lauren makes become the chief framing device McG and screenwriters Timothy Dowling (""Role Models"") and Simon Kinberg (""Sherlock Holmes"") employ. If you can get past the gross invasion of privacy issues that would exist if this were real life and not just a frothy confection what you have is some bittersweet fun peppered by bursts of sharp patter the best between the boys. Hardy (""Inception"") and Pine (""Star Trek"") are the heart of the film a proving to be excellent opposing sides of the same coin. Both balance their characters cynicism with a certain sweetness their chemistry fairly crackling electrifying the screen almost any time theyre sharing it whether taking down a bad guy or squabbling about who is more lovable (its a tossup). With Lauren on the other hand they are basically gentlemen so not electrifying. Though the role doesnt quite get Witherspoon back where she belongs Lauren has more of the kind of sweet sass that first made the actress into such a cinematic sweetheart. Since her Oscar win for portraying country star June Carter Cash in 2005s ""Walk the Line"" she has struggled from the middling disappointment of last years ""Water for Elephants"" to the downright deplorable comedy of ""Four Christmases"" with Vince Vaughn in 2008. As Lauren shes mostly rock n roll eye candy a a maniac behind the wheel and not so demur in bed either a but there are occasional flashes of some of the better past lives shes had. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESObama talks about the challenges aheadNovember 17 2008Viewfinders Keepers Images of Bygone Era Found in AtticMay 31 2004FDR by one who knew himNovember 23 2003MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-this-means-war-20120214,0,378368.story?track=rss",200,thismeanswar35,thismeanswar,latimes

(Photo Courtesy of Focus Features) The homecoming drama Return has an anguished plainness. Its protagonist Kelli (Linda Cardellini) is a reservist newly sprung from either Afghanistan or Iraqits unspecifiedwith a load of bad memories that are also unspecified (beyond a mention of dead animals on the side of the road and other weird shit). By leaving the spaces unfilled writer-director Liza Johnson ensures that (a) there no hackneyed flashbacks or tremulous revelatory monologues and (b) the movie is always in the present tense. That tense is crucial to its power. The deepest moments are of surfaces of Kelli staring out a car window at the Rust Belt landscape. Shes visibly relieved to be home but not remotely at home. Shes not Back There either. With the barest of means Johnson evokes the new veterans emotional limbo. Some of us have been waiting since Freaks and Geeks for Cardellini to have a big-screen role this rich and shes confident enough to give an almost entirely inward performance. We dont know quite why Kelli sleeps on the rug in her childrens room instead of beside her husband (Michael Shannon in a finely shaded portrait of a limited man) only that the alternative would feel unsafe. She throws back drinks with her friends in a simulation of the old hell-raising spirit but her gaudy poses are mechanical with no follow-through. After her husband moves out with the kids her only respite is in carousing with an erratic older vet (John Slattery) she meets in a court-mandated post-DUI class. Slattery for all his volatility brilliantly captures whats dangerous about some addicts They are more persuasive impersonating people in the moment than actual people in the moment are. There are a couple of hundred instances in which Johnson or her actors could take condescending short cuts and slip into white-trash stereotypes but I didnt see anyonly gifted performers vanishing into their characters refusing to pass judgment. Near the end Johnson flirts with melodrama but only it turns out as a mark of Kellis desperation. She tries to act out but just isnt crazy enough. The open ending is one of the few of late that havent made me cry Cheat This quiet naturalistic film has a classical arc and a lingering sting. Following some aborted higher-budget projects the young director of Maria Full of Grace Joshua Marston journeyed to Albania to make another compelling film touching on the perils of being youngthats it merely youngin a culture without justice. The awkward formal title The Forgiveness of Blood evokes the awkward formal set of laws called the Kanun mandating confinement to ones house on pain of death for families in which one member has committed a high crime. After their father and uncle kill a landowner in a long-lived dispute over road access the teenage Nik (Tristan Halilaj) and his younger sister Rudina (Sindi Lacej) are yanked from school and shut away for what could well be years their development literally arrested. With his father in hiding and childishly unwilling to take responsibility Nik labors fruitlessly to negotiate a settlement. Working from a screenplay he co-wrote with Andamion Murataj Marston treats the story as a case study rich in absurditiesamong them the vision of children playing computer games in a home quarantined on the word of ancient and increasingly maladaptive mores. The end is almost too painstakingly respectful of Albanian families still locked up and going mad. The film might well have been called The Punishment of Blood Feuds. The gut-whomping high-concept romantic thriller This Means War is not a distinguished addition to director McGs oeuvre. The puffy-lipped gay-bar pinups Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play best-bud CIA agents competing for Reese Witherspoon who scrunches up her face rolls her eyes and shows off her curvy little twig of a body. (The most finely tuned calipers could find no adipose tissue on any of them.) On leave from his role as Captain Kirk Pine loosens up his Shatner-esque mugging muscles but Hardy uses his patented poetic stupor as a force field as protection from jokes more bludgeoning than anything in Warrior.

In ""This Means War"" Chris Pine and Tom Hardy play Franklin and Tuck CIA agents with a special kind of relationship. They would do anything for each other even stop a bullet if it came to that. Wouldnt it be nice Tuck asks to have that kind of connection with a woman? But even with Reese Witherspoon as that woman this screwball premise lives or dies by the chemistry between Pine and Hardy who are too busy trying to out-appeal one another to make the buddy dynamic click. Misleadingly action-focused ads aside this uneven affair could score a mid-field femme following. Apart from the pics opening shootout and car-chase climax theres more testosterone to be found in either of director McGs ""Charlies Angels"" efforts than in this predictably over-the-top outing. Though it wasnt necessarily conceived that way by casting Witherspoon as the object of its male leads obsession ""This Means War"" becomes Laurens movie. Shes a successful single gal uneasily re-entering the dating world with the encouragement of ravenously horny married friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) whose every utterance smacks of insincere standup-comedy patter. No sooner does Lauren discover that Trish has posted a saucy online personal ad on her behalf than she scores a date with adorable (and inexplicably British) Tuck who may kill bad guys for a living but at least passes her deal-breaker test of not being a serial killer. Lauren has more to fear from suave Franklin (short for his given name FDR or is it the other way around?) whom she meets in a mind-bogglingly well-stocked video-rental store minutes after her date with Tuck. With multiple copies of Hitchcocks ""The Lady Vanishes"" this location is perhaps the most incredible detail in a film that blithely coasts from suspension of disbelief into check-your-brain-at-the-door territory. The script gives Lauren a few spunky lines with which to rebuff Franklins charms then serves up a forced attempt at witty repartee the following day after Franklin sneaks his way into one of the product-testing focus groups at Laurens work. But dialogue gets in the way of McGs surface-oriented style which is best used in nonverbal setpieces like the one where Lauren sashays around her kitchen singing ""This Is How We Do It"" while her two suitors covertly look for clues on how best to seduce her. As their dates grow increasingly preposterous ranging from a private tour of Gustav Klimt paintings to a bloodthirsty afternoon at the paintball range the dynamic shifts from frat-boy fantasy to female wish fulfillment in which bachelorettes can imagine themselves being pursued by two hyper-attentive suitors neither of whom has any reason to fall for Lauren as quickly as he does -- unless its the competition that spurs them on. In which case the clinch to witness is the one the film denies us between Tuck and Franklin. With previous roles Hardy (""Bronson"") and Pine (""The Lieutenant of Inishmore"" onstage) have played downright cold-blooded characters but that streak is so far buried here posing no real danger to Lauren -- or to one another. Perhaps its the pics cartoonish tone that keeps them from doing much more than look pretty trading on the stars blue eyes and impossibly big lips in lieu of their proven acting ability. In the distant background the agents have some unfinished business with a revenge-bent baddie named Heinrich (German megastar Til Schweiger given too little to do here) which would ideally have given Witherspoons character a chance to get in on the action. Instead the spy thing is just a ruse to explain away some genuinely creepy stalker behavior as both Tuck and Franklin resort to using GPS devices and hidden cameras to monitor Laurens every move. Amusing as it is to imagine America putting its terrorism-fighting efforts on hold in order to violate an intelligent single womans right to privacy such high-concept malarkey cant even seem to maintain plausibility on a basic scene-to-scene level. Its not until nearly an hour in when the spies never-entirely-convincing friendship devolves into creative one-upsmanship that ""This Means War"" kicks into being the kind of 80s-movie-style lark McG so clearly intends. But even then it feels more like an arm-wrestling match than a full-blown war.

Daily Edition Login to download This Means War Film Review 709 PM PST 2/9/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Kimberley French/ Twentieth Century Fox A month and a half into the new year and already a candidate for the worst of 2012. TWITTER Some films have certain scenes that need to be redone but on This Means War the whole picture should have been sent back for a reshoot. This perfectly dreadful romantic action comedy manages to embarrass its three eminently attractive leading players in every scene making this an automatic candidate for whatever raspberries or golden turkeys or other dubious awards may be given in future for the films of 2012. Its an eye-roller from start to finish although the promise of a sexy competition between two CIA hunks for the attention of a man-starved honey might attract some misguided souls. Originally set to open on Valentines Day which falls on a Tuesday this year the Fox release has been hastily rescheduled simply to sneak on Feb. 14 and legitimately bow three days later. PHOTOS Movie Stills From This Means War There is more than a hint of kinship between the eventually violent rivalry that develops here when best buds FDR Foster (Chris Pine) and Tuck (Tom Hardy) both court the very available Lauren (Reese Witherspoon) and the competitive relationship of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in Mr. and Mrs. Smith a fact that might have something to do with the contributions of screenwriter Simon Kinberg to both films (this one was co-written by Timothy Dowling). The more elegant ladykiller FDR and brawnier but less refined Tuck are best mates and at first think they can handle the contest but when it seems Lauren likes them both equally the claws come out. From the opening sequence set atop a Hong Kong skyscraper in which the two CIA ops stymie an elaborate robbery attempted by Eurotrash crim Heinrich (a scowling Til Schweiger) the action is staged in a manner that is both implausible and incoherent although perhaps the latter deficiency is deliberate so as to disguise the former shortcoming. In either event you cant buy what youre looking at for an instant a problem that unrelievedly permeates the subsequent 90 minutes. In fact it gets worse right away in embarrassing scenes in which the beautiful Lauren runs into an old flame and his fiancee on the street in Los Angeles and pretends shes off to meet her (nonexistent) boyfriend for lunch then immediately encounters the couple again when shes alone at a sushi bar. Surely a composed and confident 30-something professional woman like her would no longer act like a silly teenager in such a situation. PHOTOS This Means War Premiere To cure Laurens condition her so-called best friend Trish (Chelsea Handler) registers her with an online dating site which is where she comes to Tucks attention. For his part FDR tries to pick her up in a giant video store (does such a thing still exist?) but Lauren gives him an initial heave-ho after an argument over the relative merits of Hitchcock films -- he having recommended The Lady Vanishes and she insisting upon the superiority of the directors later American films. Romantic comedies have always generated fantasies of opulent lifestyles for characters with little else to do than pursue their amorous activities but what the director known as McG puts onscreen in this regard is ludicrously beyond the pale FDRs apartment which includes a babe-equipped swimming pool as a ceiling is insanely extravagant (on a government salary) and the dates to which the boys treat Lauren include a private trapeze session an exclusive peek at Klimt masterpieces and an outing to a paintball commando park where Lauren uproariously splats Tuck in the crotch with green paint. Topping things off are two ineptly conceived and choreographed action scenes In the first the guys start an all-out fight in a restaurant full of people but when they finish its empty even of staff or authorities who might want to take them to task for their destruction; the second is a car chase climaxing on a dead-end freeway ramp that doesnt cut together properly at all not to mention that what goes on makes no sense from the villains point of view. At the center of things presumably is Laurens decision of which man to choose. Her confidant is written in to provide a sounding board and goad her into action but Handler has been photographed to look practically like Laurens mom and appears entirely at a loss; the ""actress"" barely even makes eye contact with Witherspoon and has no sense of creating a character. The one thing Trish does suggest is for Lauren to give both guys a test drive. But such a move would have pushed the film dangerously into Jules and Jim territory which might have been the one move that could have provided This Means War with some genuine edge and interest but also would have made Lauren too loose a woman for a mass consumption movie such as this. No risk no gain. The three leads do look awfully good doing very stupid things and all will survive to star another day. The sooner this one recedes into the rear-view mirror the better for all concerned.
