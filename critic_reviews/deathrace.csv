In Paul W.S. Andersons brisk bone-crunching retooling of the 1975 B movie Death Race 2000 Joan Allen plays the prison warden her inmates generously call ""the baddest ass in the yard."" And to emphasize the unsubtle gender joke costumers sheath Allens own assets in the kind of suit-and-heels drag that signifies uptight bitch or secret porn star. Both really Soft sexual and racial jabs replace the more daring political commentary of the original a crude classic from the Roger Corman factory. That was the anarchic 70s baby; this is the conservative now delivered by the genre specialist who directed blank-faced destruction in Resident Evil and Mortal Kombat. Cartoon toughie Jason Statham grimaces as the wrongly imprisoned righteously muscled prisoner the warden has assigned to fill a drivers seat (and face mask) following the demise of the fan favorite known as Frankenstein. As nemesis Machine Gun Joe (originally growled by Sylvester Stallone) Tyrese Gibson does his best imitation of a standard gang leader cell-block division.

JASON STATHAM as Jensen Ames in an action-thriller set in the near future with the worlds most brutal sporting event as its backdrop in ""Death Race."" Photo Takashi Seida Movie review Death Race a bloody wreck 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Death Race Action. Starring Jason Statham Ian McShane Tyrese Gibson and Joan Allen. Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) One more reason why Joan Allen is the most underrated actress of her generation While Meryl Streep and Tilda Swinton are fine multifaceted talents neither one could pull off the line ""Activate the Death Heads"" or ""Release the Dreadnaught"" without looking completely ridiculous. Hiring Allen to play an ice queen prison warden was the only good sense demonstrated by the makers of ""Death Race"" an ill-advised and severely wussified remake of the 1975 exploitation film ""Death Race 2000."" The combination of good actors and terrible dialogue might have allowed the film a chance at minor cult status if it werent for the frustratingly inept action sequences. Perhaps worst of all the makers of this movie have removed the political satire that was infused in the original Roger Corman-produced film and replaced it with scenes from ""The Shawshank Redemption."" No pedestrians get run over for points in this film but there is a kindly older prisoner who dispenses advice lots of male bonding in the auto shop and even a moment between stars Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson thats reminiscent of the Morgan Freeman-Tim Robbins ""Zihuatanejo"" scene complete with an unintended sexual subtext. Blame this debacle on director-screenwriter Paul W.S. Anderson who makes movies as if hes been interning under ""BloodRayne"" hack director Uwe Boll. Both approach filmmaking the way that your high school lunch lady approached cuisine Individual ingredients are recognizable but the finished product is shapeless glop. While it might be filling no one with any taste could possibly call it good. The remake begins promisingly enough with product placement for Pabst Blue Ribbon. This is a world gone mad but at least you can still get good cheap beer. Statham is Jensen Ames an ex-con trying to make an honest living whos been framed for murder and tricked into participating in a drive-to-the-death racing exhibition. Ames main rival is Machine Gun Joe (Gibson in the Sylvester Stallone role). His crew chief Coach is played by an uncharacteristically sage Ian McShane. The difference between the two movies is instantly apparent. In the 1975 version Corman and director Paul Bartel imagined a detailed future then melded extreme violence and satire into one darkly funny stew. Hospital workers wheel out elderly patients on Euthanasia Day intended as sacrificial lambs for the games sick point system. Popular driver Frankenstein (David Carradine) veers around the old folks and takes out a few doctors and nurses instead. Andersons new ""Death Race"" is bloody and violent but it doesnt attempt to explore its dystopian world beyond a few lines of text in the beginning explaining the failing U.S. economy and privatization of prisons. Almost the entire film takes place within the grounds of a drab industrial penal facility - all the easier to shoot ""Death Race"" in Canada or Romania or whatever country gave the best tax break. As for the race its designed like a video game down to the flashing lights that the drivers roll over to activate their guns and smoke screens. All of the above might have been forgiven if the action sequences werent shot in close-up shaky-cam quick edits guaranteeing that no single camera angle will be used for more than three seconds. Michael Bay has been doing this with his driving scenes for years usually in small doses. In ""Death Race"" this technique is the primary means of shooting the entire film. There may have been some really good stunt work but it was either replaced by CGI or lost on the cutting-room floor. It also becomes apparent that despite plenty of executions throughout the film no innocents are getting killed. Watching a ""Death Race"" movie without a single dead pedestrian is like eating a box of Frosted Flakes without any high fructose corn syrup. This might as well be a ""Herbie the Love Bug"" remake. That leaves much of the burden of entertainment on Allen who really is excellent. There arent too many Tony-winning Steppenwolf Theatre-trained actresses who will look at a script that contains the line ""OK -sucker. F- with me and well see who s- on the sidewalk"" and say ""You know what Im on board."" Allen delivers that line with so much skill and grace shell almost make you forget that youre watching a bad movie. -- Advisory This film contains violence gore strong sexual innuendos and profanity. That last warning doesnt however apply to Ian McShane who is surprisingly f-bomb-free when traveling outside the Dakota Territory.

"Death Race | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; death-race ) Death Race (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Whether by coincidence or design the three week period from August 20 through September 10 has been dominated over the last five years by Jason Statham. In 2004 there was Cellular. In 2005 there was Transporter 2. The 2006 entry was Crank followed by War in 2007. Now for 2008 Statham has Death Race which delivers pretty much what one might expect from a movie of that name cars and carnage. Stathams films never promise to be something theyre not or offer something they dont provide. Death Race is not an exception. Paul W.S. Andersons (the Alien vs. Predator guy) creation is weak when it comes to things like plot character and acting but its very good at provoking visceral reactions and thats largely what the pictures audience will be in multiplexes for. Its a little surprising to find an actress of Joan Allens stature in an exploitation flick like this. For Statham this is his bread-and-butter but Allen usually goes for more upscale fare. One can only assume that she enjoyed playing the bitch in The Bourne Supremacy/ The Bourne Ultimatum and wanted a chance to refine her villainess skills. Here shes got the ice queen personality down to a ""T"" cool regal and ready to slip in the knife and twist it for all its worth. Shes a badass in skirt and heels - the kind of woman viewers love to hate. Her profane diatribe has to be heard to be believed. The premise borrowed liberally from the 1975 Roger Corman movie Death Race 2000 is simple. The year is 2012 and gladiatorial sports are all the rage on-line. The prisoners of Terminal Island lorded over by Warden Hennessey (Allen) participate in the Death Race where the winner takes a step toward freedom (win five races to earn a Get Out of Jail Free card) and the losers escape in a body bag (if theres enough left of them to zip up). The Death Races most famous participant Frankenstein has met an untimely end at the hands of Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson) but that doesnt stop Hennessy from bringing back the beloved Frank for another race. To that end she frames Jensen Ames (Statham) a former professional racer for the murder of his wife and makes him an offer he cant refuse play the part of Frank win the Death Race and go free. Unfortunately Jensen finds out Hennessey was behind his wifes death and revenge becomes a more important priority for him than freedom. His allies include Case (Natalie Martinez) his smokin hot ""navigator"" and Coach (Ian McShane) the leader of his pit crew. As one would expect from a long race there are plenty of mini-climaxes as Jensen faces off and defeats his opponents. Death Races actual climax is a little different than what one might expect from the beginning of the movie although it is telegraphed surprisingly early. The ending is perfunctory and doesnt offer the level of ""hands on"" satisfaction that some might desire. While the epilogue certainly wraps things up it does a better job of raising questions than answering them. Then again theres little about Death Races screenplay that even the most charitable viewer would label as ""airtight."" Logic was not one of the characteristics Anderson worried about when assembling this movie. This is The Fast and the Furious or Speed Racer on steroids although it is more about violence and gore than cars. None of the vehicles are slick and sleek; theyre armed and armored tanks with jets that spew smoke oil and napalm and fully operational machine guns mounted on hoods and roofs. The race course is modeled after a video game. As the drivers buzz around the track smashing into other cars there are ""power-ups"" to hit. The first car to glide over these power-ups can have its weapons activated or cause a deadly obstacle to spring up in the middle of the road in front of an opponent. Death Race makes a few weak attempts at satire emphasizing how bloodthirsty the human race is paying 99 a round to watch human beings get blown up and shredded. Its not a unique idea having provided the backstory for more than one action movie (the most famous of which may be Arnold Schwarzeneggers The Running Man). Heavy-handed satirical elements represent nothing more than frosting on the bloodsoaked action-packed cake however. This movie is about mayhem on wheels tough guys viewers can root for and villains whose comeuppances audiences crave. Thats what Death Race is all about and for what it is it does a solid job.

"Movie Review Death Race - 2 stars out of 5 - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie Review Death Race - 2 stars out of 5 Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic Of all the Z-movies in the Roger Corman catalog they had to remake Death Race 2000.But if the original Death Race with its murderous road rally drivers who take down pedestrians for ""points"" seemed darkly prophetic when it came out back in 1975 the new one feels ripped from the pages of tomorrows TV Guide. Paul W.S. Anderson director of video-game adaptations such as Resident Evil re-imagines this cars-and-carnage thriller as a video game come to life with convicts racing and killing each other for their freedom. Its the best idea Anderson has ever had. Jason ""Stick Shift"" Statham is Jensen Ames an ex-driver framed for his wifes murder. He winds up on Terminal Island the prison where the worst of the worst are held. And there hes given the choice -- drive or else.The ruthless warden is given an icy Nurse Ratched turn by Joan Allen. ""The life term youve shown up for may be shorter than you think"" she growls.Dont cross the lady in the high-higher-highest heels.""In here she is judge jury and executioner"" the grizzled Coach ( Ian McShane) tells Ames. Hes the old car mechanic who shows the new guy the ropes.Those ropes? A three-day race through the ruined warehouses factories and docks of Terminal Island in self-modified muscle cars Mustangs Ram trucks Chrysler 300s Porsches. The vehicles are armed with machine guns and the like. They have James Bond-style oil slick/smoke-screen defense gadgets. You drive over manhole covers that are like video game icons; ""shields"" activate your defense mechanisms. ""Swords"" turn on the guns. And theres a ""navigator"" a pretty female inmate. Because the whole thing is pay-per-view. Its not just about the killing. Its about the cleavage.Ames is persuaded to don the mask of a popular dead driver ""Frankenstein"" and race in his stead. Itll be good for ratings.The rest of the field is your Hollywood assortment of stereotypes -- an Arab an Asian assorted tattooed sociopaths and Machine Gun Joe ( Tyrese Gibson) a homicidal homosexual who had better not hear all the gay bashing from the other inmates.Whatever plot there is crawls into the backseat and then the trunk as Death Race really is about the creative ways these nuts find to kill each other. Most of the racing is caught at street level giving the movie its gas. Anderson shot the TV intros for the drivers in a sexy flashy style that will be familiar to anybody who watches Ax Men or Deadliest Catch.The dialogue is dopey the dead stretches in between races are dull (Statham stripping off his shirt and doing pull-ups) the resolution laughable. And not everybody gives us the sense that this is a deadly game that theyre mixed up in with life-or-death stakes. Natalie Martinez as ""Case"" Ames navigator wears the tight outfits well but acts as though her man is just running her down to the mall for a manicure.Statham at least gives fair value. Its impossible to watch the scowling bullet-headed ex-British Olympian without realizing ""I really need to do more situps."" He has done so many of these drive-or-die movies that the gloves seem a part of his hands.Its still a Z-grade B-movie an excuse for a next-generation video game (the original movie became an arcade game in the 70s). But with most everybody involved at home in this milieu at least Death Race feels more like a sprint than a marathon.

Death Race (R) Universal (105 min.) Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. With Joan Allen Tyrese Gibson Ian McShane Jason Statham. Now playing in New Jersey.THREE STARS One of the most interesting things about being a film critic -- outside of guessing just what this particular theater floor is sticky with -- is the breadth of material you get to look at. After all opera critics dont listen to boy bands; book critics dont stoop to Harlequins; no restaurant critic rates the latest Applebees. But movie reviewers embrace it all -- avant-garde imports and mass-market comedies dark little dramas and comic-book epics. And so the question arises Do you judge this wide range of films by the same standards? Or do you insist that each film sets its own? I was mulling over this during -- of all things -- the slam-bang car-wreck movie ""Death Race."" And actually it seemed like a good time to write about it. Because should this movie -- with its constant gory action and flaming auto erotica -- be blamed for setting the bar low? Or praised for then reaching it? The plot -- cribbed from the fave 70s drive-in exploiter ""Death Race 2000"" but stripped of its humor -- pits condemned convicts against each other in a death-by-demolition derby. Their monstrous violence is presented to the public as bread-and-circus entertainment. The victorious gladiators prize is a rare parole. The fact that our hero was railroaded to begin with makes his fight all the more intense. Its not so much a plot as a situation and the characters are just as basic. Jason Statham who plays the wronged man has all the intense expressiveness of a busted kneecap. Tyrese Gibson as his prime opponent mostly shows off his tattoos. Among the better actors taking easy checks are Joan Allen as a publicly prim and privately profane warden and Ian McShane as a convict so greasy he could rent his hair to Jiffy Lube. The veterans are good however at coloring within the lines of these cartoon characters and director Paul W.S. Anderson -- a veteran of the video-game-turned-movie genre but several evolutions beyond Uwe Boll -- moves things along. His updates are clever. As we see the race complete with its cable-show graphics we realize how close to reality -- or at least reality TV -- this already is. Hes aided by some top-notch production design and special effects which underline the excitement by using real locations and playing down the CGI. So again -- how do you judge a movie like this? On one hand it seems ridiculous to hold it to the same standards as say the new Charlie Kaufman film ""Synecdoche New York"" or the new Mike Leigh movie ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" both of which screened the same week. On the other hand it seems unfair to reward it for merely meeting its own low goals. Yet ultimately I think the yardstick is Did the movie meet what it set out to do? Did it do that in a novel or at least entertaining way? For ""Death Race"" those answers have to be a qualified yes. It doesnt set out to do more than provide an hour and a half of fight scenes and car crashes. It accomplishes that and with a certain amount of style a few twists and a minimum of plot holes. Sure its not for everyone or even most. But if youre a fan of ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" or ""The Fast and the Furious"" you wont look at your watch while the movie is going on and you wont feel conned out of your money when its over. And honestly how often have you said that this summer? About anything? Rating note The film contains gory violence and strong language.

What it is incidentally is junk. Then again the latest action inanity from Paul W.S. Anderson (""Resident Evil"") does have several things going for it. For one Anderson ignores every element unrelated to the car chases at its center - so theres no distracting plot dialogue or logic to worry about. For another this may be your only chance to see Oscar nominee Joan Allen playing a sadistic prison warden. And most important until science can shrink you down to Xbox size its probably the closest youll come to being inside a videogame. Unlike most of Andersons films though ""Death Race"" isnt actually based on a game. Its a remake of 1975s ""Death Race 2000"" a midnight movie thats become something of an exploitation classic. In this edition Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson take over for David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone with no noticeable improvement.The new version has prisoners stuck on an island where Allens warden organizes brutal races. Whoever wins earns his freedom; whoever loses gets the automotive equivalent of the death penalty. The chases are pretty cool but theres absolutely nothing else to see (besides a bored Ian McShane and eye candy Natalie Martinez). Despite the what-was-she-thinking presence of Allen theres not even any camp value to be found. Youre really better off hunting down the original which is less explosive but a lot more fun. Even so be prepared to wonder why anyone would bother circling this track twice. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

In Death Race Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) and his navigator Case (Natalie Martinez) prepare for a race in his modified Mustang V8 Fastback. Photo TAKASHI SEIDA Takashi Seida Death Race 1 / 1 Back to Gallery DeathRace killed me. Here it is this ultra-violent story about ultra-nasty convicts annihilating each other in a blood-spattered live-streaming Internet snuff show -- and it has the gall to get preachy in the foreword. The year is 2012. The United States economy has collapsed jobs are scarce and prisons are crowded; I know its hard to imagine. Private companies now control penitentiaries including a place called Terminal Island where inmates engage in hugely popular cage fights broadcast over the Web. So the preface tells us. But alas were then admonished ""The modern audience soon becomes bored. They demand more. Death Race is born."" OK. But which modern audience? Because 2012 isnt that far off (just one presidential term really) and it seems to me that the audience at present must be mighty bored if theyre demanding bloated ejecta like Death Race. Such mind-blowing cynicism I have not seen since The Condemned last years ultra-violent movie about ultra-nasty convicts annihilating each other in a blood-spattered live-streaming Internet snuff show. (It too was set on an island but they didnt race cars. Big diff.) Fans of Roger Corman and B-grade exploitation flicks will be intrigued or disturbed to learn this new effort is based loosely on that sick-boy classic of the genre Death Race 2000 -- itself based loosely on The Racer a short story by Ib Melchior. The 1975 film took place not in prison but on cross-country byways along which drivers in hotrods and bad costumes bumped off everyone and their grandparents if they could; to this day its the movie to blame whenever someone cracks a joke about hitting pedestrians (extra points for old folks). You could argue it was satire. It definitely was a goof. This time its neither. Corman again gets a credit for producing but gone are the low-budget charm (?) and nimbus of mid-1970s hairspray. In their place steroidal pyrotechnics a gunning metal soundtrack a nothing plot and the near-total visual incoherence borne of frenetic editing and those tedious shake-and-zoom camera maneuvers inspired (Ive decided) by the Marquis de Sade. Can we be done with wobbly-cam? Can it be over? It makes me sick it gives me a headache and I cant comprehend half of what occurs on screen. Or maybe thats the point. Death Race was written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (AVP Alien vs. Predator) not to be confused with Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood). His approach to the death-by-hemi genre rests on Jensen Ames (Jason Statham great of frown and fine of stubble) an ex-race-car driver framed for the murder of his wife. Sent to Terminal Island Ames is recruited into Death Race by a witchy warden (a shell-shocked Joan Allen) who vows to free him if he assumes the mask of ""Frankenstein"" -- a hideously scarred driver who died in the last race. (Listen for a voice cameo by the original Frankie David Carradine.) Ames agrees. He meets his mechanic (a purring Ian Mc- Shane the only one having any fun) his navigator (Natalie Martinez) and his modified Mustang V8 Fastback. He also meets a few rival drivers including Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson) and Pachenko (Max Ryan) who might be the lovechild of not one but two Robert De Niros (from Taxi Driver and Cape Fear). Pachenko is not to be confused with Pachinko the colorful Japanese pinball game. Contestants do their best to drive fast and whack each other employing roof-mounted guns missiles napalm cute dialogue -- you name it. Some are gored by blades; others are torched; now and then someone gets his neck snapped or his head smashed into pudding. One unlucky player is eviscerated through the car door by a large spiked wheel. The end result is so grisly hyperbolized and aimless that the sum effect is pornographic. No sex anywhere but thats what it is Car-crash porn for the modern audience. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals SanDisk 128GB Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive for 20 + pickup at...

"Death Race is a fast and furious rush - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Death Race is a fast and furious rush Jason Stratham stars as a race-car driver in Paul W.S. Andersons action-thriller ""Death Race."" (Takashi Seida) By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent / August 22 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Even when hes not adapting a video game writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson (""Resident Evil"" ""Mortal Kombat"") cant resist making his work feel like one. His redo of producer Roger Cormans cult campfest ""Death Race 2000"" lays out rules that are PlayStation-ready Drivers pass over a lighted sword icon and their cars hood-mounted artillery powers up. When they pass over a shield icon a ""defensive"" complement of oil smoke and napalm activates.Its all good when youre making (or turning out for) a movie called ""Death Race."" But smartly Anderson makes some eclectic casting choices that keep the story from feeling as though its populated by video-game characters too.Jason Statham stars as tough guy Jensen Ames a onetime pro driver framed for his wifes murder and packed off to a near-future corporate-run prison where brutal muscle-car racing has become a booming pay-per-view bloodsport. The competitions high priestess heels-wearing warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) promises Ames an expedited release if hell pose as ""Frankenstein"" (David Carradines character in the original) - a masked driver who unbeknownst to race fans died after a recent crash. Grudgingly Ames dons his predecessors Quiet Riot facepiece and just like that Franks alive.Statham and costar Tyrese Gibson as be-grilled archrival Machine Gun Joe look their parts even if dramatically theyre not always as nasty as they wanna be. But Ian McShane as ""Shawshank""-esque lifer Coach handles Amess body work and gearhead exposition with rascally crustiness every bit as amused as youll be that hes here. Allen meanwhile plays the prison matron like an HMO claims-denial exec all entertainingly thin-lipped placidity. Just you go ahead and snicker when she says of her suspiciously providential management record ""Sometimes its like the right hand of God is sitting on my shoulder""; shes got a pointed shotgun under her desk. Seriously.Thanks to its character interplay the movie doesnt drag despite taking a good 40 minutes to really rev its engines. And the racing that ensues is as loud fast hyper-edited and pulverizingly destructive as the gladiatorially minded would hope. (Theres no telling why the prison looks like an abandoned industrial site but it does make for lots of steely protrusions for inmates to get brained on. Youll wince more than once guaranteed.)Its fitting actually that Anderson would want to remake Corman never mind the tonal disparity between the two movies. Whether its video games or ""Alien vs. Predator"" or ""Death Race"" Anderson like Corman gets plenty of As for enthusiasm in his approach to B-movie schlock.

"Death Race On the right track | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsDeath Race On the right trackBack when drive-ins abounded and you could expend fossil fuels without feeling like a war criminal a movie like Death Race knew its place.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Aug. 22 2008 Death Race (out of 4)Starring Jason Statham Joan Allen Tyrese Gibson Ian McShane and Natalie Martinez. Written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. 89 minutes. At major theatres. 18A Back when drive-ins abounded and you could expend fossil fuels without feeling like a war criminal a movie like Death Race knew its place.It would have been considered a ""B"" flick meant to ""B"" attended but not necessarily ""B"" seen - who wanted to interrupt the backseat groping?That was circa 1975 and the reference point is Death Race 2000 the campy cult trash the more serious Death Race is loosely based upon. The proud issue of shlockmeister Roger Corman Death Race 2000 boasted of having one of the earliest starring roles for Sylvester Stallone (before he turned auteur with Rocky and Rambo natch). Stallone was paired with David Carradine loopier than usual in his leather suit and cape and with his penchant for mowing down pedestrians with his alligator-shaped roadster.Now its 2008 and we have Death Race as - are you ready for this? - homage of sorts to Corman who also gets a producers credit.It stars the reliable Jason Statham (The Bank Job The Transporter) and the Oscar-nominated Joan Allen. It also has considerably more plot and character motivation than Death Race 2000 which means those gropers in the backseat (or back row) are actually expected to pay attention to it. Most incredibly the cars have been toned down and so have the costumes and the sex (Natalie Martinez provides mostly eye candy as a scheming navigator). What are we to make of all this?Calm down this is still summer trash and no brain cells were injured or even fatigued in the making of it. The producers saw to that by hiring writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson (Resident Evil) an awesome hack who exists only to provide eventual company in hell for Uwe Boll and Brett Ratner.But Anderson deserves props for changing the story from its original nihilist approach to modern times into a personal quest by a man to win justice and restore his family. Anderson hasnt bothered to look too far into the future or to stretch plausibility to the breaking point. The story is set in 2012 a year when the U.S. economy has collapsed and private industry runs the penitentiary system. The capitalists help defray costs by having inmates kill one another off in pay-per-view TV broadcasts of brutal car chases. Stathams Jensen Ames is a newly laid-off steelworker who is framed for the death of his wife. Hes sent to a jail that looks a lot like Alcatraz while his newborn daughter is sent to a foster home. Prison warden Hennessey (Allen) tells him he can regain his freedom and his little girl if he agrees to join the Death Race shenanigans posing as a reborn Frankenstein a metal-masked maniac who was beloved by TV viewers until one too many showdowns with his main nemesis Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson).Ames used to race cars before he drove rivets so Hennessey has both sound instincts and an obvious motive for having framed him. Ames will now be racing not just for redemption and restoration but also payback.You get the picture which includes mucho bent metal and a sickening array of busted skulls and scorched bodies from confrontations with front grilles tire irons and a flaming whatsit that looks like Thomas the Tank Engines satanic twin.The movie is undeniably violent and definitely not for the young or squeamish but in the words of Coach (Ian McShane) Ames mechanic and mentor ""Thats entertainment"" There are times when Andersons lack of attention span pays off and bloody road sports are one of them. As for Statham he excels at turning the mundane into the meaningful. The fact that Death Race actually has a plot larger than running over little old ladies is incidental but welcome nonetheless.The film has one major road-kill victim though and I fear it might be the career of the miscast Joan Allen. Its not enough that the woman is shown with the worst plastic surgery results since Burt Reynolds went under the knife; shes also expected to mouth incredibly inane and profane dialogue that are far from her comfort zone.Not only wont she be thanking the Academy for honouring her work in Death Race she may have to resort to wearing a metal mask of her own for fear of being recognized.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Andersons ""Death Race"" couldnt be further from Roger Cormans goofy bloody original ""Death Race 2000."" As hard as metal and just as dumb Paul W.S. Andersons ""Death Race"" couldnt be further from producer Roger Corman and director Paul Bartels goofy bloody 1975 original ""Death Race 2000."" Basically a souped-up gladiatorial battle on a racetrack inside whats supposedly future Americas toughest high-security prison the pic maintains ""2000s"" body count and a few character names and dumps the rest -- including the humor. Fans of the remake may not care and will pony up for any late-summer package of high-throttle thrills. Its 2012 the U.S. economy is in meltdown unemployment and crime are on the rise and big bad corporations have somehow taken over everything including the prisons. A rather meaningless action opener showing how driver Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson) blows away an opponent named Frankenstein (voiced by David Carradine from ""2000"") gets auds heart rates pumping. Rooting interest emerges with former racecar driver and now steel-plant worker Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) being laid off with his fellow employees inexplicably confronted outside the plant by overly violent SWAT-style cops. Back home with wife Suzy and baby Piper Ames is surprised by a masked intruder who murders Suzy and frames Ames. Hes sent away to Terminal Island home of the race which is so heavily guarded that escape is futile. Much of this is explained to Ames by friendly but grizzled mechanic Coach (Ian McShane reviving the same Yank accent he used in ""Deadwood""). Big boss is warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) as tough as her well-manicured nails while the local tough guys known as ""the Brotherhood"" led by Pachenko (Max Ryan) try to send Ames a message with their fists. With Joe having bumped Frankenstein Hennessey tells Ames she needs a new contender for her ""Death Race"" pay-per-view show. Her offer Win the three-day match and he goes free. The catch Lose and he dies since only the races sole survivor wins. Coach and his pit crew consisting of nerdy brainy Lists (Fred Koehler) and Gunner (Jacob Vargas) prep Ames Mustang -- so tricked out with armaments it makes the weapon cars in ""2000"" look like puddle jumpers -- while Ames is told to wear Frankensteins metal mask as a way of maintaining the characters intrigue. But like so much else in ""Death Race"" this detail is sloppily ignored whenever the story or action conveniently requires it. Since ""2000"" was dumb on its face Bartel played it for camp; Anderson (whose other futuristic effects-heavy exercises include ""Resident Evil"" and ""Alien vs. Predator"") unfortunately tries playing it straight. Three race setpieces styled as an ""American Gladiators""-meets-""Ice Road Truckers"" TV show are the pics main events and Anderson trains all his firepower with a numbing assault of quick cuts hyperactive zooms closeups of crashes and mega-explosions lathered with a metal score by ex-Tangerine Dream member Paul Haslinger. The final race pits rivals Ames and Joe against the prisons full force -- such as it is. Pics escape plot and grease-monkey-inflected happy ending are nothing more than a mindless way to place things in park. After both ""Transporters"" ""The Italian Job"" ""Crank"" and this Statham must be getting tired of acting behind the wheel. But he does maintain his ultra-low-fat chiseled facade and low-end voice for full effect in a pic that demands little more. McShane and Allen handle their paydays with little damage while Gibson and Ryan are big masses of muscle and badass. Scott Kevans widescreen lensing was overcooked in the lab to look as metallic as possible and production designer Paul Denham Austerberry provides a stunning alteration of decaying Montreal industrial landscapes into the giant prison and race track.

A fried cheeseball. Set in the near future during the bitter final throes of capitalism Death Race is a relentless and soulless action fantasy. Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) is a laid-off factory worker who conveniently has a background as an elite race-car driver. Framed for his wifes murder he is jailed at the forbidding and inescapable Terminal Island and forced to take part in the ultimate demolition derby. Hardened convicts in armored and heavily munitioned vehicles race through a bleak industrial setting trying to kill one another. (These guys wouldnt last an hour on the Garden State Parkway.) The spectacle is a highly lucrative pay-per-view event. Now all Ames has to do is win the race get revenge on the evil warden (a frosty Joan Allen) and gain his freedom. He gets help in his quest from a wizened old screw (nicely played by Ian McShane). Whenever things look darkest and his implacable foe Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson) is bearing down on him Ames pulls off some miraculous razzle-dazzle behind the wheel. Death Race is Ben-Hur for video-game junkies. Around and around they go machine guns blazing. Director Paul W. S. Anderson (Alien vs. Predator) has fashioned an impressively dark and grim look for the film draining the screen of color while filling it with carnage. Visually its like a collision of Arnold Schwarzeneggers The Running Man and Mel Gibsons Mad Max. But even that surface appeal wears thin as Death Race grinds toward its obvious and implausible conclusion. As the three-day race enters its final stage McShane mutters ""This should be interesting."" Hes right. It should be. But it isnt. Death Race is a cinematic dreadnought imposing on the surface hollow at its core. Death Race  (Out of four stars) Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson. With Jason Statham Tyrese Gibson Joan Allen and Ian McShane. Distributed by Universal. Running time 1 hour 29 mins.

Director Darryl Roberts a well-intentioned softie follows early-blooming 13-year-old Gerren Taylor up the ranks of supermodeldom with visits to the plastic surgeon and wretched pop-scored montages. The titles indefensible; the implication is that beauty standards are a particular province of the U.S. but theres no evidence provided as to what separates us from other modern media-soaked nations (and even less made of the fact that for a people allegedly obsessed with self-image were fatties). The eminently obnoxious Eve Ensler shows up to bolster Roberts central thesis Were all helpless to resist the hypnotic tune of advertisers magazine editors and the runway bunch. Of course in the real world no industry is more widely mocked and disdained than fashion and tuning out commercials is something most cognizant people learn to do by kindergarten. Nevertheless Roberts amp; Co. seem to demand a paradigm shift -- say a return to the pre-industrial Eden (anorexia were told came to Fiji along with the first televisions). Good luck with that. (Culver Plaza; Regency Academy; Sunset 5) (Nick Pinkerton) GO  ANITA ODAY THE LIFE OF A JAZZ SINGER A good deal livelier than the usual music-doc embalming this worshipful tribute to jazz singer Anita ODay -- completed shortly before her death in 2006 by her then manager Robbie Cavolina and co-director Ian McCrudden -- is rescued from its own adoration (and too-busy faux-50s graphics) by its subject a tough cookie racetrack devotee and brassy raconteur who may be the least self-pitying reformed addict in the history of pop biographies. Whether in film clips dating back to her 1940s emergence in Gene Krupas big band or in interviews taken near the end of her life the mercurial ODay remains a voracious vivacious presence who resists being filed away even as the directors marshal hall-of-fame testimony from her many admirers -- from Margaret Whiting and Dr. Billy Taylor to actor-director John Cameron Mitchell who compares her spontaneity to Cassavetes. As opposed to her scandalous autobiography High Times Hard Times the movie is downright reticent on subjects such as a backstage rape and subsequent abortion. The directors prefer to secure ODays due as in the words of critic Will Friedwald the only white jazz singer who belongs in the company of Ella Fitzgerald and Billie Holiday. To watch her landmark tea-dress slink through ""Sweet Georgia Brown"" at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival is to hear every syllable expressed as if at the spark of conception fully formed and felt. (Music Hall) (Jim Ridley) CTHULU Fans of H.P. Lovecraft monsters with octopus-shaped heads be warned no such creatures appear in this very loose adaptation of the authors short story ""The Shadow Over Inssmouth."" Instead director Daniel Gildark and screenwriter Grant Cogswell use the story as a jumping-off point for an allegory about homophobia and gay ""reparative therapy."" Against a backdrop of global crisis (yep War on Terror metaphors here too) college professor Russ (Jason Cottle) returns to his hometown for his mothers funeral where he must confront the homophobia of his father and the town pastor (Dennis Kleinsmith) whose religion -- the worship of ancient fish gods -- is apparently just as bigoted as fundamentalist Christianity when it comes to gays. Meanwhile an old romance is rekindled with a former school friend (Scott Patrick Green) who may or may not be bi. About an hour into the movie more classical horror elements (dead kid subterranean albino people inhuman shrieks) finally kick in; prior to that the most frightening scene involves our hero being forced to have sex with Tori Spelling. Stuart Gordon adapted the story more conventionally in 2001s Dagon and it remains the better bet for Lovecraft lovers. (Regent Showcase) (Luke Y. Thompson) DEATH RACE Its not that 1975s Roger Corman-produced Death Race 2000 was so precious a grindhouse treasure that a remake seems offensive but by running over the originals blunt social commentary on audience bloodlust in dire economic times the newly homogenized Death Race has become the product once satirized. (Did we not learn anything from Rollerball?) Jason Stathams sinewy simian charisma drives the action as a former racing champ framed for murder in the dystopian days of 2012 forced by wicked warden Joan Allen to replace fallen hero Frankenstein in a pay-per-view bloodsport on wheels. Its probably cliched to compare fanboy ridiculousness like this to video games but as writer-director Paul W.S. Andersons resume includes Mortal Kombat and Resident Evil its also apt Stathams nemeses are introduced to us by their missile-mounted cars and name cards as if to say ""Select a character to play."" Ian McShanes grease monkey Coach offers tips on how to beat all three stages (as theyre titled onscreen) of the brutal race and convoluted rules about power-ups pervade. ""Activate death heads"" commands Allen who isnt quite icy enough to pull off villainy like ""Fuck with me and well see who shits on the sidewalk"" With its inexplicably watchable shotgun-riding bimbos unconscious homoeroticism and Shawshank Redemption ending The Fast and the Frivolous here is almost so bad its good. Almost ... (Citywide) (Aaron Hillis) Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat. Sep. 10 1200pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On the CW Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm GO  HAMLET 2 Not nearly as uproarious as it should be Dick director Andrew Flemings latest high school farce premiered at this years Sundance Film Festival and after a spirited bidding war was sold for a cool 10 million.Concerning a childish mans struggle with adult responsibility and as its title suggests a sons relation to his father the movie -- which Fleming wrote with South Park veteran Pam Brady -- is a sort of backstage Bad News Bears in which a beleaguered high school drama teacher (Steve Coogan) attempts to save his job by staging a musical sequel to the most famous play in the English language. (To add to the fun his class is heavily salted with lovable mainly Latino gangbangers.) One of the funniest men in England Coogan here plays American -- which is to say he projects his character as a sincere idiot. Coogan will do anything for a laugh and given how little he has to work with here he has to. Its impressive that he can fill the screen even though hes still regularly upstaged by Catherine Keener in her specialty role as castrating spouse never more inspired than when playing a scene with a margarita as big as a birdbath.Perhaps because it deals with the anxiety of influence Hamlet 2 is surprisingly sympathetic to writers ""Oh my God -- writing is so hard"" Coogan exclaims at the word processor. He accepts advice from a 12-year-old drama critic and in the grand finale is saved by the national press which rallies around the production as a free speech issue. Not exactly Springtime for Hitler the climactic musical features a ""Raped in the Face"" number and a familiar-seeming ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus"" routine in which a beatific fright-wigged Coogan descends from the ceiling to intone ""Father I forgive you."" We know that the now-liberated actor is actually talking about his earthly dad. The show ends with Coogan still suspended in the air -- not unlike the movie which not quite a parody is something like a failed metaphor for itself. (ArcLight Hollywood The Grove Landmark AMC Santa Monica 7 ArcLight Sherman Oaks) (J. Hoberman) GO  THE HOUSE BUNNY Anyone who saw her light up the edges of Lost in Translation and Just Friends or steal the entire show in Gregg Arakis Smiley Face knows by now that Anna Faris has been shaping up as the most inventive screen comedienne of her generation -- and she proves it once more in this lace-panties-thin farce about a happy-go-lucky Playboy bunny who finds herself unceremoniously booted from Hefs mansion after hitting retirement age (27 which were told is really 59 in ""bunny years""). Living out of her car on the streets of L.A. Shelley (Faris) eventually takes up residence as house mother to a bunch of sorority-girl also-rans a few plastic surgeries shy of supermodel status and ... well you can pretty much guess what happens from there. Directed with little distinction by SNL vet Fred Wolf The House Bunny operates on the level of a skin-deep sociological experiment with a predictable be-yourself inner-beauty message; as Faris turns her fugly charges from homely brainiacs and man-hating shut-ins into superficially gorgeous judgmental twits she finds her own slutty charms (including a hilarious send-up of Marilyn Monroes billowing-skirt routine from The Seven Year Itch) at a loss to woo the smart dorky-cute man of her dreams (Colin Hanks). The screenwriting team of Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith are rather shamelessly aping their own Legally Blonde here but theyve written Faris some great ditzy one-liners (""The eyes are the nipples of the face"") which she takes and runs with occasionally tripping over someone or something along the way and landing a pratfall worthy of Olympic gold. The movie is basically on one level and Faris on another -- in that exclusive aerie occupied by Judy Holliday Carole Lombard Lucille Ball and a few other blissfully original comedy goddesses. If only there was a Hawks or a Lubitsch around to keep her in steady employ. (Citywide) (Scott Foundas) GO  IN SEARCH OF A MIDNIGHT KISS Did Los Angeles sign with a new agent? Thats the impression made by writer-director Alex Holdridges In Search of a Midnight Kiss in which our fair city best known for its performances as urban jungle moneyed playground and future dystopia has been cast against type as the sort of blissful iconographic lovers paradise typically played by New York London or Paris. Here is an L.A. movie in which people manage to make meaningful interpersonal connections without crashing their cars into one another. After all theres always Craigslist. Thats where Wilson (Scoot McNairy) a self-pitying Texas transplant still nursing the wounds of a broken relationship meets Vivian (Sara Simmonds) an impetuous aspiring actress auditioning potential dates on a lonely New Years Eve. Hes hit rock bottom epitomized by a scene in which Wilson jerks off to a Photoshop-ed photo of his roommates girlfriend. Vivian is a diva in fur collar oversized sunglasses and oversized attitude. But she agrees to give Wilson a few hours in which to win her favor and if he does she just might give him that elusive witching-hour smooch. Keenly aware that theres nothing romantic about being stuck on the freeway Holdridge gets his characters out of gridlock and onto public transit from Hollywood to downtown and back where they banter bicker and just maybe fall in love in the shadows of the Orpheum Theatre St. Vincent Court and the L.A. Stock Exchange -- all photographed in lustrous black-and-white by cinematographer Robert Murphy (provided that is you see In Search of a Midnight Kiss in a theater and not via distributor IFC Films on-demand cable service where it is being presented in color). Holdridges film veers wildly between low-key romantic comedy and antic slapstick (especially in the third act when Vivians blockheaded ex-boyfriend comes home to roost) and doesnt always hit the mark. But this is one of those auspicious no-budget indies that makes you feel like youre catching a slew of bright young talents at the dawn of their careers -- McNairy an unlikely but ingratiating leading man with bedhead and slack jaw; Simmonds a wonderfully appealing screwball ingenue; and Holdridge who has a welcome eye for the timeless in a rapidly changing metropolis. (Sunset 5; Monica 4-Plex; Playhouse 7; Town Center 5) (Scott Foundas)  THE LONGSHOTS In the 90s Ice Cube and Limp Bizkit co-headlined the Family Values Tour as respectively a rap legend and the nadir of music up to that point. Cube and Bizkit frontman-cum-filmmaker Fred Durst reteam for The Longshots canceling each other out into total mediocrity. Curtis Plummer (Cube) is a laid-off factory worker just like everyone else in Minden Louisiana; he spends his days in mild alcoholism one Bud tallboy at a time. Sister Claire (Tasha Smith) needs someone to look after her daughter Jasmine (Keke Palmer) while shes working. And guess what happens? Disgruntled uncle and unhappy niece (an aspiring model who spends her time reading fantasy books making her the easy target of every kid in school) bond over football; Jasmine shows off her terrific arm joins the team takes them to the Pop Warner Super Bowl and reinvigorates the hopes and dreams of an entire town. Based on a true story rendered nearly unrecognizable -- the real Jasmine developed over several seasons rather than a few weeks for one thing -- The Longshots strains so hard to inspire every moment underlined with a by-the-numbers score that it ends up totally innocuous. Director Durst and DP Conrad W. Hall bathe everything in a sickly beige neutering all but Cubes natural charisma. (Citywide) (Vadim Rizov) MIRRORS Often kidded for the many times he bellows ""Dammit"" at 11th-hour moments on 24 Kiefer Sutherland finally gets to show his range -- and he proves equally skilled at ""Goddammit"" and ""Shit"" Even so its a mystery why Sutherland attached himself to this dour muddled thriller (copied from a Korean shocker) about a tormented ex-cop literally bedeviled by evil forces that use mirrors to stalk their prey. The demons have powers that wax and wane at whim like wizards at the command of a 12-year-old Dungeonmaster one moment they can yank apart someones jaws the next they cant even steer Sutherlands car into an oncoming truck. Fans of murky tedium will be in heaven apart from a few gory moments French splatter maven Alexandre Aja (The Hills Have Eyes) directs on the principle that a movie cannot have enough scenes of someone creeping through dimly lit sets. Aja saves his one clever visual trick for the end along with a Zabriskie Point finale full of slow-motion exploding glass. Maybe thats why the ungodly 110-minute running time feels like 47 years of bad luck. (Citywide) (Jim Ridley) THE ROCKER Directed by Peter Cattaneo The Rocker is more or less the Pete Best Story -- the tale of a poor bastard who gets shitcanned right on the brink of record-bin immortality. The film opens in Cleveland mid-1980s where Rainn Wilsons Robert ""Fish"" Fishman is behind the kit for Vesuvius a metal band fronted by three head-bobbing hair-waving morons (Will Arnett Fred Armisen and Bradley Cooper) whose loyalty only extends to the dotted line. Told to either ditch their drummer or lose a deal with a record label his bandmates choose the former sending Fish into a tailspin from which he never recovers. Until decades later that is when he falls in with A.D.D. the high-school band for which his portly pale nephew (Josh Gad) plays keyboard. Fish wins over the sulking songwriting frontman (Teddy Geiger) and the brooding scowling guitarist (Emma Stone) and theyre signed and touring and sell-out famous within hours of making their Interwebs debut. Sooner or later theyre forced to choose between opening for Vesuvius or busting up the band. A juvenile fairy tale that plays like the pilot for a Jonas Brothers sitcom on the Disney Channel this is sugary-sweet stuff -- pop instead of rock. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)  GO  TEN NIGHTS OF DREAMS Based on an anthology of short stories published by Japanese writer Natsume Soseki in 1908 Ten Nights of Dreams is a sometimes terrifying sometimes wildly amusing and occasionally flat interpretation of Sosekis tales by a whos who of Japanese filmmakers. To achieve the surreal dreamscapes mapped out on the page the assorted directors toy with genre (Kon Ichikawas ""Second Dream"" is in part a tongue-in-cheek silent film that takes playful aim at the tenets of Buddhism and the mythology of the samurai) use claymation serve up off-kilter hip-hop dance moves and shape unnerving shadows through artful lighting. Of special note is the wistful ""First Dream"" which was directed by the late Akio Jissoji just before his death in 2006 and is especially resonant as it deals with the feelings of abandonment and confusion following the death of a loved one. But the highlights of this collection are The Grudge director Takashi Shimizus ""Third Dream"" with its fused psychology of writers block and paternal angst personified in the form of a creepy puppet-child and the final dream directed by Yudai Yamaguchi whose wittily biting stance on pork consumption would earn it the PETA seal of approval. (ImaginAsian Center) (Ernest Hardy) WHAT WE DO IS SECRET In my day you had to visit a dozen Blockbusters to find a ratty copy of The Decline of Western Civilization. Now the story of Darby Crash and the Germs has been pruned into the same formulaic Great Man narrative youd expect to see applied to say Babe Ruth. Crash the frontman of one of SoCals more enduring punk acts was a self-immolating conflicted queer in a scene whose attitude toward the gay stuff was ambivalent at best. In his book Enter Naomi author Joe Carducci was clearly talking about the Germs clique when he wrote that Hollywood rocks tone ""was set by show-biz pedophiles grabbing after faghags-in-denial chasing reluctant homosexuals back into the closet"" -- an analysis about a zillion times smarter than Secrets treatment. Combining the stereotypes of a hundred indie coming-out dramas with an insight into intra-band politics worthy of a VH1 pundit first-time writer/director Rodger Grossmans version of the Germs story with Crash played by Shane West sounds almost verbatim like the far superior 2002 oral history Lexicon Devil The Fast Times and Short Life of Darby Crash and the Germs. The worst kind of bastard adaptation Secret subtracts without adding Whats not on-screen is the covert thrill of teenage self-invention that kept Germs armbands circulating on a generation of weird kids despite media indifference and cultural amnesia -- and much of the reason that Crashs story bears telling.

Because it feels so good when you stop. That pretty well describes the effect of seeing Death Race director Paul W.S. Andersons take on Death Race 2000 the er well classic doesnt really describe it. How about cult hit? At any rate Andersons take is ultraviolent ridiculously stupid and kind of a rush. If your brain has an ""off"" switch youre well-advised to use it. And the carnage is relentless. But so is the adrenaline. In the spirit of things Anderson just puts the pedal to the metal and never taps the brakes ignoring such typical movie traffic laws as character interaction and lucid plot development. When you have an 8mm machine gun on top of your supercharged Ford Mustang GT who needs em? Death Race is set in 2012. The economy has collapsed and for a time people are pacified by fights to the death in prison. But like any show that goes on too long that gets old. Then comes Death Race the creation of Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen - yes Joan Allen) the hyper-control freak who runs Terminal Island. As the name implies its the end of the line where the baddest of the bad go to rot. The idea is simple a car race where you win by surviving. In other words you have to kill your opponents. Drive them off the road shoot them with the weapons your car is tricked out with whatever it takes. Its a national sensation with tens of millions of viewers watching streaming video. Win five races and youre set free. The fans favorite is a driver nicknamed Frankenstein because he wears a mask to hide hideous scars. One problem Unbeknownst to the public Frankenstein gets killed in a wreck. Luckily for Hennessey in comes Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) newly framed and convicted of his wifes murder. The setup is obvious. If Ames takes over for Frankenstein and wins the fifth race he walks returning to his baby daughter. If he loses he dies. Think the fix is in? Over a barrel Ames accepts. And from there its gruesome racing; the only breaks in the three-day event are overnight car repair. Ames mentor is Coach (Ian McShane) no longer a prisoner but in for so long he couldnt face life on the outside. Frankensteins chief rival is Machine Gun Joe (Tyrese Gibson) the cocky winner of three races. Each driver has a navigator most of them buxom babes from the womens prison so as to boost ratings. Ames navigator Case (Natalie Martinez) proves especially resourceful. But really its all about the horsepower and the body count. Statham doesnt have much to do other than act tough and drive well. Its kind of funny to hear Allen a three-time Oscar nominee and a Tony winner curse a blue streak. But its a shame to see McShane reduced to arching his eyebrow and uttering action-movie pabulum. And the reality-TV social commentary falls flat. Ultimately watching Death Race is about as close as an audience can come to playing a video game in the theater. If that sounds like a recommendation so be it. But remember you can reset most video games or walk away in the middle and not feel like youve missed a thing. That holds true here as well.
