Comments click to enlarge The Crazies Video 2010 George A. Romeros Night of the Living Dead (1968) ended with a crushingly ironic scene in which the lone survivor of a zombie onslaught is mistakenly shot down by the authorities. When Romero made The Crazies (1973) he managed to spin that idea into an entire story after the U.S. military accidentally unleashes a bioweapon on a small town the uninfected have to protect themselves not only from their mad-dog neighbors but from the trigger-happy soldiers trying to contain the epidemic. Poor distribution doomed the original movie though Romero has stuck around long enough to serve as executive producer of this respectable update by Breck Eisner (Sahara) which is getting a nationwide release. There may not be any second acts in American lives but at least there are plenty of remakes. With Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell. R 101 min. By J.R.

Saeed Adyani/Overture Films/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? In ""The Crazies"" a small Midwestern town is infected with an experimental virus that kills people but not without first turning them into homicidal maniacs. Worse yet than the virus are the feds who quarantine the area and slaughter anyone they even suspect of having the bug. The local sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) his pregnant wife (Radha Mitchell) and two other hopefully uncontaminated friends (Joe Anderson and Danielle Panabaker) try to escape while keeping a suspicious eye out for loonies soldiers and most scarily symptoms exhibited by each other. Breck Eisners remake of George A. Romeros 1973 horror film is aesthetically justifiable only because the original wasnt very good. While it loses the charm of Romeros low-budget clunkiness it is in all other regards superior. Unfortunately its not better than ""28 Days Later..."" which is close enough to count as an unofficial remake. Grade B- (Rated R for bloody violence and language.)

Overture Films hide caption toggle caption Overture Films The Crazies Director Breck EisnerGenre HorrorRunning Time 105 minutes Rated R for bloody violence and language With Timothy Olyphant Radha Mitchell Danielle Panabaker Joe Anderson Watch Clips Big Plane Theres Somebody Outside Is He Dead? The recent vogue for remakes of classic 70s horror has been a boon to studios looking for fast and cheap products that are sure to turn a profit. For genre fans though its generally meant a dearth of new scares and a dilution of cherished memories. But why? Why is it so difficult to effectively remake films that were themselves made on the cheap by inexperienced upstarts? Purists may decry the trading in of yesteryears grit for a new generations gloss but the fast and loose production values were not what made the early works of Wes Craven David Cronenberg or George Romero into instant cult classics. The defining aspect of the best films of that era -- the thing that makes them worth remembering -- is that they had something to say. Theres a subtext of smart social commentary percolating just below the blood and body counts. Romero was particularly adept in this regard and his 1973 small-town epidemic thriller The Crazies touched on biological warfare the bureaucratic ineptitude of government in crisis situations and the breakdown of social rules in a widespread panic. Breck Eisners remake starts from the same premise A government plane crashes outside a small town tainting the water with an engineered viral agent that turns residents into the titular homicidal maniacs. As the town is quarantined and the locals get rounded up to prevent the spread of the bug a handful of people attempt to avoid capture and get out; theyre led in this version by the town sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) and his pregnant wife (Radha Mitchell). But instead of putting us in the middle of the authorities disaster-management effort -- a potential gold mine of material for post-Sept. 11 and post-Katrina America -- Eisner hands us a faceless two-dimensional occupying force. And rather than attempting to get inside the mentality of a town put on lockdown he assumes a few mobs breaking through fences will suffice. More important the movie doesnt try to make much sense. Were expected to believe that quarantine and recovery efforts wouldnt have begun until days after the crash. In fact the government seems to have completely forgotten about their downed plane until people start getting sick. Eisner and his screenwriters also conveniently change the symptoms and severity of the infection to suit how lucid they need a character to be in a given scene. The incoherence is made all the more disappointing because Eisner displays a great deal of raw talent for the genres tone and set pieces. Theres an iconic horror-movie beauty in the image of a woman standing in front of a roaring combine the spinning blades casting flickering lights on her face. He strikes just the right measure of bloody dread in a quiet darkened clinic with patients strapped to gurneys and a madman on the loose with a pitchfork. Meanwhile a shot of a circular autopsy saw skittering out of control across a mortuary floor toward the sheriffs groin and a battle within an automatic carwash manage to strike an effective Raimi-style balance between campy laughs and heart-pounding thrills. The film might even have earned a pass as a mediocre yet entertaining exercise based on these strengths. But it succumbs to its worst inclinations in the final reel leading to an unbelievably nonsensical climax that renders The Crazies like too many of its fellow retreads both pointless and forgettable.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 26 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Crazies Directed by Breck Eisner Written by Scott Kosar and Ray Wright Starring Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell Classification 18A Back in 1973 The Crazies a typically rambunctious horror flick from George Romero took dead aim at the bellicose climate of the Vietnam/Watergate era. Now in the genteel hands of director Breck Eisner its been not so much remade as restrained - tamed and dumbed-down and with any sharp political edges safely filed off. All that remains is an occasional bloodbath and a few boilerplate scares. Ours apparently is a more sensitive age. Although the setting has shifted from Pennsylvania to small-town Iowa the premise is basically the same Thanks to a U.S. military experiment gone awry the towns drinking water gets contaminated by a virus that leaves its victims with an incurable case of psychotic violence. So infected civilians feel obliged to kill in contrast to the professional soldiers who are merely trained to kill. Of course Romero had tons of fun with this conceit ratcheting up the metaphoric volume with gleeful abandon. Pretty soon town officials were immolating themselves like Buddhist monks while back in the command bunkers generals debated whether to nuke the place - a play on the infamous Vietnam logic of destroying the village to save the village. Here all that blackly comic finger-wagging is entirely gone with no attempt to find any contemporary equivalent. Instead the focus that rested partly on the military the invading army now settles exclusively on the brave local hero and his little posse - that would be sheriff Dave (Timothy Olyphant) his pregnant spouse Judy (Radha Mitchell) and his trusty deputy Russell (Joe Anderson). Forced to gun down an old coot with a sudden fondness for foaming at the mouth our sharp-eyed lawman begins to suspect nefarious doings a suspicion that deepens when a once-peaceable farmer torches his farmhouse with his wife and kid inside. Hey could be somethings in the drinking water. Shortly after the army descends to turn the entire town into a fenced concentration camp locking up the infected and the innocent alike. The script tries to get some au courant terrorist mileage out of this - the difficulty of sifting out the crazies from everyone else and the consequent sacrifice of liberty to security - but quickly gets bored with the effort. Almost as quickly as we do. This leaves trusty old Dave bun-in-the-oven Judy and that increasingly aggressive deputy to scurry hither and yon doing their formulaic best to seek out opportunities for set-piece gore - here a knife through the hand there a buzz -saw buzzing toward some guys nether parts - all the while fending off the uniformed shooters on one side and the more casually attired nutcases on the other. Theyre a moderately busy trio to be sure but its just business as usual. And that blandness is interesting. Technically the horror biz has grown a lot splashier since 1973; thematically however the genre has become quite conservative. The blood is certainly convincing these days but it generally flows only in the safest and most inoffensive uncontroversial directions. Seems we were so much older then were younger than that now.

(Handout) Joe Neumaier Thursday February 25 2010 1102 PM Title Theres nothing wrong with cheesy horror so long as the cheese doesnt melt like muenster in the sun and the horror is genuinely scary. Unfortunately ""The Crazies"" has warmed-over chills and a muddled zombie-like execution.It also wastes a fine genre coupling in Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell each veterans of slightly better shlock (he with ""Hitman"" and ""A Perfect Getaway"" she with ""Pitch Black"" and ""Silent Hill""). Yet even Olyphant and Mitchell are slumming it here.The movie starts out with ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers""-type evil-among-us creepiness. In a rural Iowa town Sheriff Dutton (Olyphant) notices ordinary people acting inexplicably violent beginning with the guy in coveralls walking onto the Little League field with a shotgun. (In horror movies generally watch out for the guy in the coveralls.)Duttons wife Judy (Mitchell) a doctor treats a fellow who seems zoned out and who later becomes homicidal. Quickly Dutton finds a huge plane that crashed in a river and deduces that this river leads to our water supplyYup turns out there was a hazardous supply of biowarfare something-or-other on the plane and everyone drank it and their faces peel and then the killin begins. The Duttons and a deputy (Joe Anderson) have to get the hell outta town except all those crazy people are in the way.A lot of the implausibilities here are par for the course - no one except the local loon saw or heard a plane go down? Can you really just write off a small nuclear explosion as a ""chemical fire""? - and have a long if not quite hallowed tradition (the movie is a remake of a 1973 B-thriller from George ""Night of the Living Dead"" Romero). But the zombie-like first-stage crazy eventually switches to suddenly-maniacal crazy which is less fun. Worse it devolves to simple run-and-hide cliches usually accompanied by jarring musical jolts.The movie is also apparently an act of contrition for its director Breck Eisner. The son of one-time Disney head Michael the junior Eisner made the 2005 big-budget adventure ""Sahara"" which despite being based on a popular paperback series having Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz in the lead roles and making money at the box office was a huge financial disaster due to behind-the-scenes dealings.""The Crazies"" seems to be Eisners penance the Hollywood-royalty equivalent of community service or spending a summer working with Dads fave charity. Except with ripped flesh and sliced jugulars substituting for the community.

Timothy Olyphant stars in the horror film ""The Crazies."" Photo SAEED ADYANI ASSOCIATED PRESS | OVERTURE The Crazies 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Given the choice between a genocidal military or hemorrhaging Iowa neighbors armed with really sharp objects (e.g. a circular saw) which way would you go? Would you run toward or away from the soldiers in gas masks? Me Id head for the wacky neighbors because the military has much bigger weapons. As repeatedly demonstrated in The Crazies demented Iowans can easily be shot in the head or gouged in the neck -- and they seem to travel alone wreaking havoc on a one-to-one basis in homes and truck stops. One word of caution though Always look behind you. Theyve got a way of creeping up. Such are the lessons learned from this businesslike slice-and-dicer a remake of the low-budget classic (if thats the word) about a tainted water supply that prompts humble townsfolk to butcher family friends and co-workers often quite imaginatively. We meet Pitchfork Man who dispatches residents with a hard plunge through the chest; Funeral Home Man who sews up their eyes and mouths; and the knife-wielding Farm House Lady who immobilizes one fellow by stabbing his hand to the floor. The armed services enter the picture the usual way -- in Humvees with lots of guns. You can probably guess why. You can probably guess most of what happens although the ending might catch a few viewers off guard. The script follows the usual format for apocalyptic horror movies introducing us to a handful of survivors as they rush across a depopulated landscape to escape death by weirdo (zombie vampire toxic farmer). The characters are standard issue Pierce County Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) his mustachioed deputy (Joe Anderson) his lovely doctor-wife (Radha Mitchell) and his doctor-wifes perky teen assistant (Danielle Panabaker). The scares too are standard issue which is to say they arent especially scary. I call them shock-pops shrewdly timed surprises (an eye in a keyhole a face in a window) that pop out of nowhere and make the audience jump. The Crazies was directed by Breck Eisner (who made Sahara of all things) from a screenplay by Scott Kosar and Ray Wright who adapted the 1973 film by legendary schlockmaster George A. Romero -- credited here as an executive producer. This upscale redo boasts less plot and fewer characters than the original but the hairdos are spiffier and the special effects have graduated from cheapo stage blood to the sort of extravagant gross-outs that horror audiences now routinely expect. Romero had quite a lot on his mind back in the day Vietnam the Kent State shootings a wicked distrust of the military and the Man in general. Eisner has almost nothing on his mind no political rumblings nothing behind the urge to upgrade vintage trash. The Crazies boasts one or two halfway-decent performances -- Anderson as the spunky deputy fairly boings off the screen -- and a few rather interesting camera angles but arty reflections in a gas mask will only get you so far without suspense or narrative purpose.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 26 2010 1029 AM The Crazies Whats missing from the latest well-made horror film. By Dana Stevens After youve seen The Crazies get a dose of sanity with our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. The Crazies If a horror movie can be described without insult as ""comforting"" that would be the word for Breck Eisners The Crazies (Overture Films) an adaptation of the 1973 George Romero film about a murderous contagion spreading through a small town. The Crazies scares you in exactly the way you think its going to scare you; it hits all the expected schlock-horror beats but still manages to conjure a scream when the bad guys loom up from the shadows. It isnt a period-obsessed riff on 70s gore or a somber deconstruction of it just a modestly budgeted and not terribly ambitious updating of the formula. That sounds like faint praise but I quite liked The Crazies. It lacks the fevered sincerity (and the political timeliness) of Romeros original but its tightly scripted cleverly cast consistently scary occasionally funny--everything you could ask from a well-made and completely unnecessary remake. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In a small Iowa farming community called Ogden Marsh Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) is watching a high-school baseball game when he notices the former town drunk wandering onto the field armed with a shotgun and glazed stare. Assuming the man has fallen off the wagon Dutton approaches him and after a tense negotiation is forced to kill him in self-defense. Dutton is consumed with guilt--even more so after it turns out the victim had no alcohol in his bloodstream but was simply and inexplicably compelled to go on a killing spree. Other townspeople soon begin falling victim to the same mysterious malady. Out of nowhere their skin goes gray their gaze fixed and they grab the nearest death-dealing implement--gun pitchfork or in a pinch gasoline and a match--and start doing their neighbors in. Advertisement The sheriff investigating with his loyal deputy Russ (an excellent Joe Anderson) discovers a crashed plane submerged in the river that provides the towns water supply. Biological weapon government cover-up something something--long story short the crazies want to kill us all. (Though the director has pointed out the difference between crazies and traditional zombies their narrative function is basically identical Both are blank-eyed clammy-skinned killing machines whose evil spreads by contagion.) Within days the town of Ogden Marsh is in flames and government troops in hazmat suits have moved in to herd the uninfected citizens into camps. The sheriff along with his deputy; his pregnant wife Judy (Radha Mitchell); and a teenage girl (Danielle Panabaker) must find a way to escape the containment zone and make their way to safety in Cedar Rapids. Their journey is beset by obstacles both horrific and comic and a few nifty set pieces including a very screamy ride through an old-fashioned drive-through car wash. In many ways The Crazies fits into the trend of nostalgic ""artisanal"" horror we talked about earlier this year in the ""Movie Club"" small movies like Drag Me to Hell Paranormal Activity and The House of the Devil that rely more on old-school psychological suspense than CGI special effects and extreme gore. Its not just that directors are mining the thrillers of the past for story ideas (though thats as true of horror as it is of every other innovation-starved genre). There seems to be a genuine interest in returning to the feel of B-movies of the 70s and 80s with their tiny budgets and big ideas. The original Crazies and to a greater degree Romeros Night of the Living Dead movies were as much about race relations consumerism and the fraying of the social fabric as they were about the fear of brain-eating zombies. This Crazies was co-written by Scott Kosar whos making a career of dusting off period horror He scripted the remakes of both The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Amityville Horror. (Please tell me no one is going to touch Phantasm.) Kosar and Eisner (whos the son of the former Disney head Michael Eisner) understand the mechanics of the spook-out and they go out of their way to establish a specific sense of place and a solid cast of characters before setting loose the circular-saw-wielding morticians. But the filmmakers seem less clear on what really made those early Romero films great which is something that by definition cant be re-created by any level of loving craftsmanship They were timely. For all their ragged editing and over-the-top hysteria those zombie flicks channeled and allegorized the anxieties of the post-civil rights (and later post-Watergate) eras and whatever our cultural paranoias and phobias may be today theyre no longer the same. To make horror movies that matter filmmakers have to think about what scares them--not just in the movie theater but in the far more terrifying world outside.

Breck Eisners remake is slicker prettier and dumber but not entirely without merit. The cast is very strong Timothy Olyphant exudes old-fashioned tough-guy charm as the small town sheriff whose constituents begin falling prey to a disease which turns them into bloodthirsty zombies while Radha Mitchell provides credible if thankless support as his wife. Theres also an impressively high-strung turn from Joe Anderson (Peter Hook in Control) as a redneck cop on the brink.But the film feels choppy and roughly edited as though its makers were so keen to keep it short that they hacked out any scares atmosphere or sense of impending dread. Theres too much story and key details are absent or underexplained. Though far from unwatchable The Crazies feels like a missed opportunity.

I know its getting prohibitively expensive to work with animals in films (in the US it is anyway) but surely Eisner could have persuaded his financiers to cough up for some local livestock color so to speak? Romeros original foregrounding a tattered Old Glory against a background of anarchic miltaristic horror managed to make an astringent comment on Kent State-massacre-era America. Eisner however offers preposterously laundered and well-groomed heterosexuals running all over the place while lots of things blow up. As Tom H. points out theres zero atmosphere zero dread zero anxiety and a whole shitload of wasted narrative opportunities.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 12 2010critiqueFeaturedOpens intriguingly but soon descends into standard genre territory.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 8 2010AFeaturedThe film was quite good beter then alice in woderland blood guts and actionFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/88369/the-crazies.html,200,thecrazies11,thecrazies,timeout

Forgive me but when I saw it I thought it was a zombie movie. I mean it wasnt a romantic comedy. It wasnt a Scandinavian bank-heist thriller. The ghoulish men and women who were infected by the ""rage"" virus and immediately came after the uninfected did to my untrained eye look a lot like the lurching-corpse predators I remember from Night of the Living Dead Dawn of the Dead and the 1979 Italian classic Zombi 2. But no the monsters -- am I allowed to call them that? -- in 28 Days Later werent technically speaking the living dead. They didnt die before they became monstrous; they simply...transitioned. In that light Im a little unsure of whether to say that the walking catatonic angry humanoids in The Crazies are zombies. I guess Id say that they arent though theyre certainly zombie-esque blank-faced possessed and out for blood. Like the mysterious attackers in George A. Romeros original 1973 version of The Crazies theyre the result of exposure to toxic chemicals. The biggest difference between the two movies -- and were cued to it early on -- is that the creation of the...uh zombie-type creatures in Romeros film was due to an accidental calamity. In the remake (excuse me reinvention) there are enigmatic controlling forces at work. Heres what I can say for sure about the humanoid attackers in the new version of The Crazies Theyre not very interesting. As in I dont care how this premise has been dressed up weve seen it a jillion times before. As always theres a ""political"" message Attempting to escape our heroes a married small-town sheriff and physician (Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell) run smack into a makeshift military compound where everyone wears gas masks and white bio-hazard suits and lo and behold the cure is worse than the disease the fascist government crackdown is more threatening than the whatever-they-are-since-theyre-not-zombies and so on and so forth. The director Breck Eisner is a veteran of TV commercials and visually he certainly understands what hes doing. He knows just how to unsettle you with a vicious gouging knife fight or an ingeniously timed shot of our heroes car getting blown to smithereens by a military helicopter or Olyphant and Mitchell sneaking around an abandoned diner in the apocalyptic finale trying to avoid those last zombie stragglers. I know I know Theyre not zombies. By the time this movie is over though you may feel like one yourself.

The Crazies Fair to good Director Breck Eisner. Cast Timothy Olyphant Radha Mitchell Joe Anderson. Rating R for bloody violence and language. It cant maintain that pacing throughout suffering some inconsistencies in story and performance. But the remake of George Romeros 1973 film is still a lot of fun for horror fans a nice little jaunt through paranoia and conspiracy theories. In the big picture the government is the bad guy. In the moment however the school principal with a blood-drenched pitchfork will do quite nicely thank you. Its a typical day in Ogden Marsh Iowa. Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) is taking in a high-school baseball game when a man carrying a shotgun wanders into centerfield. Dutton tries to persuade him to drop the gun; he wont so Dutton shoots him. The next night a farmer sets fire to his home after locking his wife and son inside. When Dutton gets to him hes as blank and emotionless as the man with the shotgun. Soon a parachute is found in a swamp along with a pilot who evidently ejected from his plane. Dutton and his deputy Russell (Joe Anderson very good) solve at least a piece of the mystery They find a crashed plane submerged farther up the swamp. The water flows directly into the towns water supply. But what was in the plane? Theres no time to worry about that as the towns residents grow murderously crazy. Dutton and his wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) the town doctor appear unaffected as does Russell. But before they can figure out whats gone wrong the military swoops in and herds Ogden Marshs residents into buses then into fenced-off pens quickly and sometimes cruelly separating anyone with a fever from everyone else. To Duttons horror they take Judy away as well. Dutton and Russell manage to get back to Judy; along with Becca (Danielle Panabaker) who works in Judys office they try to escape both the military and the infected either of which can be lethal. Director Breck Eisner sets up the story well with Dutton realizing along with the rest of us with increasing dread that things have gone seriously awry. (""You know what?"" he asks his deputy as the phones and computers go dead. ""Were in trouble."") But the military arrives too quickly changing the tone and focus of the movie. Its also not clear how the toxin affects its victims some of whom seem able to control their symptoms for a time. Some are ravenous savages basically zombies (no surprise with the Romero lineage). Others seem to work together in a crude sort of way. In a nice touch the crisis brings out the worst in some of those who are immune who prove as crazy as those who are affected. There are a couple of terrific set pieces including one in a car wash that builds suspense through a wall of soap bubbles and ends with well a bang. Also as paranoia sets in among survivors its a mistake to lose your temper. Are you just mad or are you going mad? Maybe Olyphant should always play sheriffs. Hes not as good here as he is in his best role as Seth Bullock in HBOs brilliant ""Deadwood."" But hes not bad as the steely jawed optimist determined to get through the crisis. Anderson however is better. His Russell proves deeper than we first realize and Anderson does a nice job of developing him. ""The Crazies"" wont make anyone forget ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""28 Days Later."" But despite the victims not technically being zombies its a worthy effort in the canon upon which it depends for context. Truly if your town is ever overrun by lunatic-killer types dont say ""Im no world-beater but I had plans."" Then youre just asking for it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goody koontzarizonarepublic.com.

"The Crazies review Remake of horror film succeeds with less violence |       NJ.com comments The Crazies review Remake of horror film succeeds with less violence Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 25 2010 at 454 PM updated February 25 2010 at 644 PM View/Post Comments Saeed AdyaniTimothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell star in Overture Films ""The Crazies."" You know the neighbor whos been giving you those odd looks lately? Yeah that one. The one who stares at you sometimes like hed like to kill you? Well you know what? He does. But thats okay because a couple of hours from now youre going to want to kill him too. The Crazies (R) Overture (101 min.) Directed by Breck Eisner. With Radha Mitchell Timothy Olyphant. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Three stars Rating note The film contains gory violence and strong language.Thats the plot of ""The Crazies"" a new horror film about a ""rage virus"" thats contaminated a small town. Pretty soon half the population is infected and intent on killing the other half. And pretty soon after that the military arrives in full force. To quote another conflict apparently it has become necessary to destroy the village in order to save it. If the plot sounds vaguely like ""28 Days Later"" and tempts you to yell ""rip-off"" well contain your own rage. That hit movie used the same idea (without credit) as the original version of ""The Crazies"" made in 1973 by zombie king George Romero. This movie is the official remake made with Romeros blessing -- albeit not all of his political paranoid style. His gritty DIY version featured some memorable (if unrepeatable) acts as all humanity fell by the wayside. This slicker more polished movie contents itself with simple good scares. It has a bunch of them though and an appealing star in Timothy Olyphant as the sheriff of that small Iowa farm town. With one deputy one jail cell and a town drunk its pretty much a Mayberry existence. Until the senseless slaughter begins and the Army occupation starts. And the sheriff realizes he and his wife have to get out fast. Its still a great premise for a movie -- with Olyphant and his wife played by Radha Mitchell having to flee maniacs and the military -- but like its madmen the film sometimes runs in circles. The characters get someplace and think theyre safe. Then a crazy looms up in the background. A fight begins. The crazy is killed always just in time and the characters run to another place where they think theyre safe. And another crazy looms up Still Olyphant -- one of the best things in last years tourist-in-danger movie ""A Perfect Getaway"" -- makes a good capable hero (even if Mitchell has little to do as his wife). The rural American settings (for once not shot in Canada) are fresh. Director Breck Eisner finds a few new spooky images too -- a threshing machine running by itself a plane submerged in a quiet lake. The movie never takes you anyplace truly uncomfortable -- for that you have to go back to the source material. But the new ""The Crazies"" still delivers a good scary horror show. And maybe -- just maybe -- a warning to keep a closer eye on that neighbor of yours.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Crazies  1/2 out of four Stars Timothy Olyphant Radha Mitchell Danielle PanabakerDirector Breck EisnerDistributor Overture FilmsRating R for violence languageRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Fans of George Romeros cult original know the drill First theres infection then insanity kicks in and soon the killing starts. Hence the memorable moniker The Crazies. The infected bear a demented resemblance to the undead but these zombie types have a tendency toward pyromania and a fondness for fashioning creative weaponry. In keeping with the Iowa locale of this apocalyptic film violent acts spring from the most ordinary farm equipment. A pitchfork punctures victims torsos; high-tech threshers are fired up and ready to go. THE CRAZIES Watch the trailer Director Breck Eisner stylishly reimagines Romeros 1973 scare-fest. The originals Vietnam War subtext gives way to a survivalist mentality that speaks to homeland-security fears and pandemic-wary mindsets. Its the standard setup A plane bearing biological toxins crashes in a lake contaminating the regions drinking water. Theres a cover-up but the locals start acting strangely and complaining theyre ""not right."" Indeed all is wrong. Poisoned people turn into murderous lunatics with creepy stares and bloody noses. As lead survivor and town sheriff Timothy Olyphant is smart stoic and sympathetic. His wife the town doctor is played with intelligence and pluck by Radha Mitchell. In moments of peril they are precisely the kind of victims audiences want vulnerable but savvy. As expected for a horror film jolts abound and blood spews. But there are no bloodbaths. The film shocks and scares us but it wisely avoids gruesome extremes. Eisner focuses instead on the evil that lurks within and nearby a spreading disease and the fearsome sight of a family member becoming infected and going bonkers. It all happens at lightning speed which underscores the fear factor. Satellite imagery conveys the ominous sense of being watched. The Crazies is familiar B-movie fare but its also lively fun and presented with well-paced flair. Be sure to watch it in a safe and contained area.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Crazies"" rocks. This remake of George A. Romeros 1973 biological warfare shocker is a trim taut terrifying essay in homespun horror. If Pa in Grant Woods ""American Gothic"" had impaled Ma on the end of that pitchfork the scene would fit right in. The setting is bucolic Ogden Marsh Iowa the sort of upright farm community where the high school baseball game is the highlight of the weeks calendar. Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) knows everyone by name so when the town drunk wanders onto the diamond shotgun in hand the lawman tries to peaceably talk him down. But theres something other than alcohol in the mans blood and the confrontation is only the beginning of the towns troubles. Something very bad is circulating among the good folks of Ogden Marsh and in three days time Dutton will be just about out of bullets. This is a slick fearjerker filmed with brilliant visual style and edited with sadistic precision. The town has a frayed lived-in look and when director Breck Eisner begins turning off the lights and setting homes on fire it transforms nicely into an atmospherically chilling hell on earth. Horror movies always gain resonance when they connect to the mood of the day and the tagline for this one -- ""Fear Thy Neighbor"" -- is a three-word snapshot of our present moment. If youve ever allowed your radio tuner to drift away from your favorite political talk station to listen to what The Other Guys are saying among themselves you have surely concluded that there are lunatics wandering the streets and the corridors of power. This movie taps into that paranoid vibe as nice people who joshed each other on Monday are using each other for target practice on Wednesday. The sheriff his wife (Radha Mitchell) his deputy (Joe Anderson) and the town doctor who all keep the town stable and healthy in good times look on helplessly as their community descends into madness. The government is behind it of course accidentally triggering the outbreak and imposing martial-law containment procedures that only make matters worse. The movie is a nonspecific political parable -- you can read it as an indictment of the economic bailout or tea bag fist-shakers -- and that makes it all the stronger. Pick your own villain. THE CRAZIES  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for bloody violence and language. But thats subtext Romeros specialty. The main event here is screaming and squirming and the film is stuffed to bursting with great fright scenes. Eisner directs the film with gritty vigor. A battle between Dutton and the local coroner uses an electric bone saw to terrifying effect. At one point it skitters across the floor toward Dutton as he backpedals on all fours his crotch exposed to its ravenous circular blade. Its a nerve-wracking sight gag that freezes the laugh in your throat. ""The Crazies"" would have John Carpenter on his feet applauding.

"The Crazies - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW The CraziesThe remake of George A. Romeros indie film drops the social commentary of its day in favor of todays over-the-top horror-genre chills and thrills.February 26 2010|By Robert Abele Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell are a couple in a town battling for survival. (Saeed Adyani / Overture...)Who wouldnt want the best for a movie with such a deliciously reactionary name like ""The Crazies""? It first belonged to zombiemeister George A. Romeros 1973 indie provocation centered on a small towns mental and physical disintegration following a mysterious water contamination. It now marks the latest in jacked-up horror remakes (""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" ""Halloween"" ""The Hills Have Eyes"") that replace iconoclastic chills with paint-by-numbers shocks. Things start promisingly spooky enough in director Breck Eisners version when inhabitants of Iowa farming community Ogden Marsh begin shifting from folksy to frowny and finally homicidal. Just when perceptive Sheriff David (reliable screen-holder Timothy Olyphant) and his pregnant doctor wife Judy (Radha Mitchell serious as a heart attack) are beginning to grasp the nature of this town-wide change -- which stems from a secret plane crash releasing a deadly man-made toxin -- theyre violently swept up in a crude military containment operation. It soon becomes clear that any citizen -- corrupted or not -- is expendable. After escaping government clutches theyre joined by Davids deputy (Joe Anderson) and Judys medical assistant Becca (Danielle Panabaker) in becoming fugitives in their own backyard no longer trusting of once-recognizable neighbors or their own supposed protectors. As epidemic scenarios go ""The Crazies"" has solid underpinnings for going in any direction bloody social commentary or nasty good time. But if Romeros chaos-fueled original pockmarked with troops-versus-civilian shootouts and bureaucratic bickering was intended to mirror a fractured societys uneasy pulse (think Vietnam) Eisners loud squishy and jokey redo simply reflects other movies including westerns disaster flicks and zombie creep-outs. (Eisner and writers Scott Kosar and Ray Wright play up the infected-as-undead element a lot more than Romero ever did oddly enough.) Not that theres shame in favoring fright tactics and gory set pieces over sledgehammer points about rampant militarism. But why keep the sledgehammer? Nearly every scare in ""The Crazies"" is telegraphed whether by suddenly too-tight photography or shrieky crescendos of sound. After a while youll just stop counting the arms of friends or foes jerking into frame and cover your ears waiting for the expected sonic exclamation point. The movies attitude toward carnage meanwhile is the most schizoid asking us to toggle between emotional loss (when a beloved character dies) over-the-top giggles (take that mindless killer) and -- in an ill-advised Holocaust allusion -- moral outrage. Whichever the reaction though ""The Crazies"" only ever amounts to genre-regimented madness. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESYoure Next upends the horror genreAugust 17 2013Review In V/H/S some found footage should remain lostOctober 4 2012The Crazies ready to go nutsFebruary 26 2010The House of the Devil goes for scary not goryOctober 25 2009Adams still has his guitar after allOctober 29 2008MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewHorrorEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-crazies26-2010feb26,0,18566.story",200,thecrazies19,thecrazies,latimes

Sony Pictures Classics By John Anderson Updated Feb. 26 2010 1201 a.m. ET The most American movie of the year is French. ""A Prophet"" the incendiary crime epic from Jacques Audiard is an immigrant allegory a parable of ambition a Horatio Alger-esque up-by-the-bootstraps saga about a man cast into a figurative New World where he must eat or be eaten. Like ""The Godfather"" which it regularly recalls ""A Prophet"" serves up crime as a metaphor for life and power set in a world of chaos that is dependent on codes and rules. But while the Corleones were a family within a family Malik (Tahar Rahim) the hero of this film is the supremely solitary man--beaten disheveled cut up and frightened with no family country allegiances or mother tongue. And what director Mr. Audiard would like us to know is how dangerous a thing that is. More Film Reviews Through a constricted lens shooting through a network of bars fences and grates Mr. Audiard introduces us to Malik as he is ushered into the French prison where he is serving a six-year sentence. Is he guilty? Malik protests his conviction once then never again; he never complains or explains. But his stoicism seems less about a resolute nature than an understanding of institutions The roadwork of scars on his back are all the map we need into his abusive past; presumably the fresh gash under his eye which never really fades was the work of the police he claims he never attacked. Only during a grilling by a prison administrator do we glimpse Maliks history childhood in a juvenile center no parents no ties no sense of self. ""What language did you speak at home?"" he is asked and looks puzzled. Home? There was no home. It is prison that has been waiting for him and prison is where hell find himself and his dubious fortune. The penal hellhole in which Malik finds himself is ruled by Corsican mobsters--even the French are largely invisible in this film which uses the Third World to mirror the First. Led by the gnarled lethal Cesar Luciani (a wonderfully venomous Niels Arestrup) the prisons ruling class is threatened only by its own grasping and a growing Muslim population. When Cesar gets orders from the outside to kill a witness named Reyeb who is being held in isolation he has a problem Reyeb (Hichem Yacoubi) rarely leaves his cell and being an Arab has a healthy aversion to the larger prison population. But he has expressed a sexual desire for his fellow Arab Malik. And so it is Malik who is chosen to kill him while feigning a tryst and hiding a razor blade in his bleeding mouth. And it is Malik who cant get out of it no matter how he tries. Not if he wants to live. With a narrative momentum that almost never relaxes ""A Prophet"" is a movie in which violence or its shadow is everpresent and when it happens very real--quick messy awkward largely inefficient. This is not Hollywood mayhem or Tarantino-inspired buffoonery. The murder that changes Maliks life--saves it in a way though its victim will haunt his dreams--may drive a few viewers toward the exits and a few under their seats. The rest will simply stare at the red spurts and the writhing. But what is meant to be really horrifying is Maliks moral dilemma. And it is. ""A Prophet"" marks a tonal shift for the gifted Mr. Audiard and there are moments when its energy or ours perhaps flags just a bit. But like his better-known films--""The Beat That My Heart Skipped"" ""Read My Lips""--""A Prophet"" is uncompromising in its style story and characterizations. Malik is not just an antihero. His on-screen ancestors are every supporting player killed off in a gangster/prison movie since cinema began. For all the tribal conflicts surrounding him Malik stands alone quietly calculating his suffering offered up toward something better. Mr. Audiard didnt really need the blazing title across the screen explaining that Malik was spending ""40 days and 40 nights in the hole"" for us to get his New Testament view of Maliks role in the cosmic universe He may not be dying for anyones sins but hes a consequence of them. He has already been dubbed a prophet and what he presages is not good news. The Crazies ENLARGE Danielle Panabaker in The Crazies. Overture Films George A. Romeros 1973 original was an underbudgeted thriller about a Pennsylvania town in the grip of a bloody nightmare Biological weapons accidentally dumped in the water supply turning the locals into lunatics. Where Romero always went right--in ""Night of the Living Dead"" for instance--was rolling with the poverty letting the campiness play out while also venting his indignation about governments and authority. Where he went wrong at least back then (a new Romero film ""Survival of the Dead"" comes out this spring) was in not raising enough cash. Watch a clip from ""The Crazies"" a remake of George Romeros ""Night of the Living Dead."" Timothy Olyphant Radha Mitchell Joe Anderson and Danielle Panabaker star. Video courtesy of Overture Films. Director Breck Eisner doesnt have this problem. In remaking Mr. Romeros ""Crazies"" he has the luxury of a grander budget real actors and nearly three decades worth of advancement in special-effects technology. And he has Mr. Romeros very plausible scenario What would happen if the U.S. government poisoned its own people and the result was an epidemic of homicidal mania? Would the reaction be rational and humane? Or martial law panic indiscriminate incarcerations and the wholesale slaughter of the infected? Like all the best thrillers ""The Crazies"" abuts believability with convincing performances by Timothy Olyphant as small-town Iowa sheriff David Dutton Radha Mitchell as his wife Judy and Joe Anderson as Russell the deputy. The big difference between Mr. Romeros film and Mr. Eisners--which is so intelligent you fear the fanboys will scatter--is that Mr. Eisner never gives us the militarys point of view. All we know is what David and Judy and Russell know which for a long time isnt much. And ""The Crazies"" is all the scarier for it. Formosa Betrayed Sunday marks the 53rd anniversary of the ""228 Incident"" the massacre of as many as 30000 native Taiwanese by Chiang Kai-sheks Kuomintang in 1947 an event so suppressed that generations on the island were long unaware it even happened. Not coincidentally at all this weekend sees the release of ""Formosa Bertrayed"" which stars James Van Der Beek as an FBI agent who at the tail end of the White Terror Period of martial law (1949-87) goes to Taiwan to help investigate the Chicago murder of a Taiwanese-American professor. What he meets rather than a desire for justice is obfuscation scheming and a government with dirty hands. Despite the righteous indignation that is so clearly fueling the film--much of its 8 million budget was raised from off-island Taiwanese--the movie is a sturdy entry in the paranoid-thriller genre and raises some interesting issues about our relationship with the country we used to call China. --John Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD Focus ENLARGE Read My Lips (2001) In his third feature as a director Jacques Audiard displayed his penchant for odd couplings Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) a deaf secretary whose lip-reading skills are sharp enough that she can interpret the malicious remarks of her male colleagues; and Paul (Vincent Cassel) a lug whos recently served time for aggravated robbery. In Paul Carla sees a means of revenge on her venomous co-workers. As per Mr. Audiards blackly comedic inclinations opposites here dont just attract they alchemize with Carla turning Paul into a gentleman and he turning her into a hussy and a crook. ENLARGE The Beat That My Heart Skipped (2005) A remake of James Tobacks 1978 film ""Fingers"" but a singular work regardless this Audiard-directed drama follows the quasicriminal real-estate thug Tom Seyr (Romain Duris) as he tries to change his life and rediscover his potential as a concert pianist. His teacher Miao Lin (Lin Dan Pham) speaks no French and Tom no Chinese or Vietnamese so--as he did in ""Read My Lips""--Mr. Audiard creates affection that transcends language as the course of Toms errant life heads toward an ending both ironical and heartbreaking. ENLARGE The Crazies (1973) Although it never got a decent release and more or less bombed at the box office George A. Romeros low-budget (less than 300000) story of a town gone nuts has influenced any number of sci-fi and horror films from ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" to ""28 Days Later."" As in the new Breck Eisner remake the plot involves the accidental dumping of bio-weapons in a rural water supply followed by lunacy murder and a military crackdown. Place it in the valley between those pillars of Romero-ism ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978). --John Anderson Find related television listings at LocateTV.

Romero proud.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Feb. 26 2010 Starring Timothy Olyphant Radha Mitchell and Joe Anderson. Directed by Breck Eisner. 101 minutes. At major theatres. 18A Theres something ""not right"" about some of the citizens of sleepy Ogden Marsh Iowa. One minute theyre going about their business. The next theyre stark-staring bonkers and homicidal maniacs to boot.First-time director Breck Eisner has retooled George A. Romeros 1973 low-budget The Crazies for a modern audience swapping the originals sex scenes and cheesy look for more realistic splatter and the slick style of a studio picture. But he stays loyal to Romeros originals intent making a statement about the perils of a ruthless self-serving government turning on its citizens served up within the framework of a solid horror thriller.Article Continued BelowSheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) and his wife Judy the town doctor (Radha Mitchell) start seeing some decidedly oddball things in both lines of work with the behaviour escalating to horrific heights. Once-normal folks start off staring into space and then quickly spiral into full-blown insanity. The next thing you know theyre either dropping dead or chasing you down with an autopsy saw.David with his good ol boy deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson) in tow unravels the mystery of whats behind the loco locals discovering the water system has been contaminated with some sort of crazy-making virus.All hell breaks loose with the arrival of the military in Hazmat suits. Townspeople are rounded up loaded onto cattle trucks and herded into a containment site at the local high school. The fear and obsession surrounding whos sick and whos not leads to panic for which the military quickly shows it has zero patience. It soon becomes evident who the true crazies are and its not the newly zombified residents.Eisner brings plenty of tension and some gratifying scares amid the ordinariness of Main Street U.S.A. clapboard farmhouses and wide fields. And he doesnt need to rely on gore to achieve it as seen in a run through a car wash that employs no blood but will make you jumpy about more than whether you remembered to roll up the windows next time you wash your wheels.Thats not to say splatter fans dont get their fix. They do.Screenwriter Scott Kosar also responsible for remakes of The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) teamed with Case 39 writer Ray Wright on the script. Despite the occasional dumb line they keep things ticking along aided by a solid cast. Handsome Olyphant makes a credible sheriff and a strong leading man. Its not as if the role of lawman is new to him; his former HBO western series Deadwood has spawned its own loyal Deadheads.Aussi actress Radha Mitchell (Silent Hill) is equal to the task as zombie fighter and Anderson (Max in Across the Universe) brings a solid performance to the kind of role that rarely rises above second banana.Toronto moviegoers who donned face masks during SARS or lined up for hours for H1N1 shots that never materialized may have their own personal take on how the government reacts to the looming epidemic in The Crazies.

But for decades its citizens decency has matched the towns anonymity. Dr. Judy Dutton (Radha Mitchell) takes care of the births and the ordinary illnesses; her husband David (Timothy Olyphant) the local Sheriff keeps the peace with the aid of his Deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson). Nice town yknow what I mean? Until that day during a school baseball game when Rory Hamill strode out of center field carrying a shotgun he wouldnt put down and David had to shoot him dead. That caused a little stir. Then Bill Farnum locked his wife and son in their farmhouse and set the place on fire. Each of the perpetrators had this strange dead look on his face. Pretty soon one by one the good folk of Ogden Marsh were turned into psycho killers. The normals had become the crazies. And all because they drank the water. (See pictures of the Rise of the Zombies.) Thats Act One of The Crazies directed by Breck Eisner from a script by Scott Kosar and Ray Wright. The story fans out from its Anytown-Goes-Crazytown first half-hour into a besieged-heroes scenario in which David Judy and Russell are hemmed in both by the zombie-ish locals and the military in hazmat suits who have come to contain the plague at the cost of Ogden Marshs very existence. Its an efficient thriller with scare weapons ranging from the primitive (a pitchfork) to the apocalyptic (an A bomb). The acting is only horror-film-functional and you might wish that our trio of renegades knew a few basic laws of the genre -- dont go anywhere alone and please leave your vehicle before its sent into the killer car wash -- but you have to give Eisner points for knowing where all the bodies are buried and how to unearth them suddenly for maximum effect. (Read an interview with The Crazies director Breck Eisner.) This is a remake of the 1973 The Crazies by George A. Romero whose 1968 zombie classic Night of the Living Dead has been the inspiration for countless remakes and rip-offs. (Romeros latest film Survival of the Dead may go direct to video.) The Crazies -- about people whose minds are poisoned by the towns water supply -- wasnt quite so trailblazing. It built on that potent science-fiction trope the takeover of personality by an alien entity that dates back to Philip K. Dicks 1954 story ""The Father-Thing"" in which an eight-year-old suspects that his fathers not quite right and finds a menacing replicant in the garage. A year later Jack Finney fleshed out the premise in his novel The Body Snatchers the source for the 1956 Invasion of... movie version and its three remakes. Alex Garlands script for 28 Days Later... in 2002 blamed the plague on a virus injected into monkeys. In The Happening two summers ago M. Night Shyamalan reprised Romeros Crazies concept except that the toxin is transmitted through the air not the water and turns its victims suicidal not homicidal. Romero expanded this premise into parable of a government experiment gone horribly wrong in wartime. He posited that a plane containing a deadly virus crashed in a lake near a small town; the military then takes drastic actions to contain it. Made during the Vietnam war and just after the revelations of a My Lai massacre the original Crazies had an unmissable Vietnam analogy the military must destroy this village to save the country. The local folks could almost be seen as Vietnamese civilians politicized by attacks on their village and fighting back by any means necessary. Theres also the fluoridation angle which played into suspicions held mostly on the Right that the Communists could poison us in our kitchens without ever firing a shot. These days a tap-water plague would be more limited; in ritzier communities the drinking glasses and the dog bowls are filled with Evian. But for its time The Crazies functioned as a compendium of paranoia. Rarely has a conspiracy thriller exploited so many fears. (See the top 25 horror films of all time.) In the original film Romero tested the viewers sympathies partly balancing the plight of the few uninfected townsfolk with the attempt of a Colonel and a scientist to find a cure. The remake dispenses with these nuances turning the military into a vague malevolent force that spies from above on Ogden Marsh then quarantines or removes the townspeople. By doing so it exploits the enmity across the political spectrum for people in power. Its sour view of government intervention would suit both the American Left in the Bush-Cheney era and the Tea Party today. As we watch the three people we care about go through the familiar motions of trying to elude capture and escape the plague we have to find interest in their different reactions to having to kill former friends on sight. For Sheriff David the more logical liberal one becoming a vigilante is a burden; for the more trigger-happy Russell its liberation. (See if The Crazies comics are worth the money.) Of course if the heroes didnt go a little gun-crazy The Crazies wouldnt be a horror movie. The truly radical approach would be to depict an ordinary place let its people stay ordinary and find meaning and drama in their lives and deaths. But nobody wants to remake Our Town. Everybody wants to remake Romero. See why zombies are the new vampires. See TIMEs Pictures of the Week.

From the publicity notes to the horror flick ""The Crazies"" ""a huge step above most movies in this genre"" . . . ""based in a reality that could happen"" . . . ""a shoot that was often epic in scope"" . . . ""the aftermath is like the riots in Los Angeles or Hurricane Katrina"" . . . ""there are elements built into it that reflect the times we live in"" . . . ""I can see students sitting in coffee shops all over the country after seeing this picture saying What about this? I think it has lasting value."" From my notes to the same movie ""Guy with shotgun blown away in center field during baseball game"" . . . ""Guy locks up wife and children sets fire to house"" . . . ""Bone saw heads for guys crotch"" . . . ""loud horror noise but its only wife tapping her husband on the shoulder"" . . . ""murderer about to strike down woman gunshot guy concealed behind him shot him in the nick of time"" . . . ""zombie car wash."" Even for a horror movie ""The Crazies"" is a bore and were talking about the most boring genre this side of dysfunctional-family indie drama. A remake of the 1973 movie by George A. Romero ""The Crazies"" takes place in a corn-fed heartland where the hayseeds go haywire thanks to a zombiefying poison dumped in their drinking water. (OK theyre not technically zombies just dead-eyed killing machines who wander the landscape intent on murdering anyone in their path but Im confident theyd be welcome at any zombie-family picnic.) PHOTOS HIGH-BROW HORROR A sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) and his doctor wife (Radha Mitchell) try to escape the terror and solve the puzzle of why their fellow middle Americans have suddenly gone berserk. To the extent the plot leads anywhere its to a gag about evil military experiments (hardly a comment ""on our times"" the device has been a horror staple for decades) but the subject is barely dealt with even as allegory. Director Breck Eisner spawn of Michael (now theres a horror movie idea -- talentless progeny oozing mediocrity across the land) made his debut with ""Sahara."" Its fortunes were such that Eisner has been absent from big screens for the intervening five years. But then again Stanley Kubrick took five years between ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""The Shining."" Yes this is the first paragraph in history to mention both young Eisner and Kubrick. Eisners technique -- find a cliche then pound it in -- may scare you out of your wits if you didnt have a whole lot of them to begin with but unlike Romero he misses every opportunity for cleverness. How can you do a zombie car wash and not make it even a little funny? Breck Eisner has the answer. Nor do the characters amount to anything. In an early scene a potentially interesting question of courage and loyalty arises (""Ill make a deal with you You dont ask why I cant leave without my wife and I wont ask why you can"" says the sheriff to a coward) only to be instantly dropped so we can hurry on to a pitchfork stabbing. All effort to make the dialogue presentable ceases in the second half so its lucky for you this is the kind of movie that inspires audiences to contribute their own bon mots. ""Pop dat fool Pop him"" cried one citizen at the screening I attended. That line beat most of the chatter up on the screen which burbled with gosh-were-sure-in-trouble talk such as ""You wanna give up? You wanna sit here and die?"" Er maybe but only in exchange for the assurance Ill never have to sit through another Breck Eisner movie. kyle.Smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Carly Simon lets slip a clue to pops great mystery Read Next Carly Simon lets slip a clue to pops great mystery Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46764 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20339 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 17970 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Starring Timothy Olyphant Radha Mitchell Danielle Panabaker Joe Anderson Preston Bailey Justin Welborn Lisa K. Wyatt Christie Lynn Smith Larry Cedar Lori Beth Edgeman Director Breck Eisner Running time 141 Release Opened Feb 26 2010  Editorial Review Its nothing to make overBy Dan KoisFriday Feb. 26 2010Adapted from horror master George A. Romeros micro-budget 1973 classic ""The Crazies"" delivers some satisfying scares but skims blithely over the darker ramifications of its story. Romeros original -- about a small town overcome by an epidemic -- simmered with Watergate-era distrust of authority and made the governments response to a crisis as creepy as the crisis itself. Director Breck Eisners remake nods to contemporary anti-government sentiment but its military villains are as faceless as the virus that turns the residents of Ogden Marsh into blood-spattered psychopaths -- and substantially less scary.""The Crazies"" wants to be a monster movie for people who are positive the black helicopters are coming. Itll have to settle for being an adequately gruesome thriller that exploits the deadly possibilities of a carwash even better than ""The Final Destination.""Timothy Olyphant plays Sheriff David Dutton the first to connect a series of shocking local deaths with a downed military plane in the nearby swamp. As Ogden Marsh is quarantined -- the phone lines cut the Internet shut down -- Dutton struggles to escape along with his pregnant doctor wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) and his live-wire deputy Russell (the terrific Joe Anderson).As a series of scary set pieces ""The Crazies"" is fitfully effective. Out in the wide-open cornfields of Iowa where most of the movie was filmed the band of refugees is safe from crazies but at risk from storm troopers and the aforementioned black helicopters. Once they seek refuge -- in houses truck stops and barns -- theyre prey for their fellow townspeople now transformed by the virus into diabolical murderers. If the rhythm of the movie gets a little stale the individual moments of mayhem still have the power to shock. Theres something very unnerving about seeing the movies ordinary-looking bit players made ghastly by the effects of the virus. (Particularly frightening is the towns milquetoast high-school principal stalking Judy with a pitchfork.)Whats disappointing about ""The Crazies"" though is the lack of care that Eisner and screenwriters Scott Kosar and Ray Wright put into their films atmosphere. Theres little in the way of Romero-esque dread; Eisner substitutes a grim lack of humor and frequent splashes of gore.While its foolish to look to disposable thrillers for narrative coherence it would have been nice if the viruss effects on its victims were consistent. Some crazies are rendered babblingly incoherent; others hold grudges and make diabolical plans. In some crazies the madness manifests itself in malevolent silence; others cheerfully whistle or sing. (One songbird madwoman is played enjoyably by Lynn Lowry the 1970s schlock princess who appeared in the original ""Crazies."") In the same way that zombie movies are annoying when the rules of zombiehood are broken so ""The Crazies"" suffers when its monsters dont make sense.In the end were left with our ragtag trio of survivors and the movies success depends on their charms. Olyphants sheriff seems like a bit of a lightweight at first but credibly grows into a crazies-killing machine. Mitchell dependably toggles between screamy and tough. And Anderson -- spindly and clever with sad blue eyes and a silly handlebar mustache -- gives the movies best performance as the dependable Russell whose loyalty to his sheriff is sorely tested on the road to Cedar Rapids. Russells travails give ""The Crazies"" a moral weight it otherwise lacks and suggest for a while the more interesting movie it might have been.Kois is a freelance reviewer.Contains bloody violence and obscenity.

Credit Saeed Adyani/Overture Films The problem with ""The Crazies""? Not crazy enough.Breck Eisners remake of a 1973 George A. Romero creepfest -- about the accidental release of a bioengineered virus (it causes insanity) near a small town -- has the imprimatur of the master Mr. Romero is executive producer of the new film. Unfortunately it doesnt have his style or sense of humor.The filmmakers (the tepid screenplay is by Scott Kosar and Ray Wright) seem so determined to make a serious respectable horror movie that they have only the bare minimum of fun. The occasional out-pops-a-homicidal-maniac jolts are too well telegraphed to be very scary and the denouement manages to be both apocalyptic and anticlimactic.Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell grind through their performances as the married couple -- he the sheriff she the town doctor -- who try to lead a small band of the uninfected across fields and Interstates to safety. (The original took place in Pennsylvania; the remake is set in Ogden Marsh Iowa which despite its highly unlikely name does not appear hospitable to light verse.)They are caught between their increasingly crazed neighbors and the federal government which comes in to quarantine the town but starts to shoot everyone in sight when things get out of hand. Maybe a better title would have been ""Zombie Tea Party.""""The Crazies"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

And soon enough other folks start picking up knives and power saws torching cars and strangling loved ones their eyes glazed over like doughnuts.Bloody doughnuts.A timely and grisly genre piece that captures the anxieties of our time (collapsing social order? - check; wariness of Big Government? - right) The Crazies is at first entertainingly creepy and intense.But as the sheriff and his beautiful pregnant town-doctor wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) try to (1) figure out whats going on and (2) save themselves from contamination and death director Breck Eisner (Sahara) cranks up the gore to levels that are overpowering and unpalatable. I think it was the guy with the pitchfork making rounds through a sick bay where Ogden Marshers were strapped helplessly to gurneys - a stab here an emphatic disembowelment there - that did me in. Not fun.Olyphant has a cool amiable vibe kind of postmodern Jimmy Stewart while Mitchell brings intelligence and quietude to yet another role that doesnt deserve such consideration. (Whats up with her career?) British actor Joe Anderson (Across the Universe) plays Daves deputy with a Midwestern drawl and a rangy humor that serves the movie well for a while. But then all the predictable silliness - and impalements and dismemberments - take over. And its amazing that Sheriff Dave can work the stick shift of a tractor-trailer with a hand thats been run through by a kitchen knife - but hey maybe its just the extra adrenaline that comes from being pursued by pop-eyed cretins with automatic weapons.Look for the fatalistic punch line at the end a satellite shot of another Iowa town and some computer text that tells you whats in store for the citizens down the road.

"Crazies The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; crazies-the ) Crazies The (United States 2010) February 25 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Crazies which is based on the 1973 George A. Romero film of the same name (Romero gets an Executive Producer credit for this one) continues the trend of recent films to delve into apocalyptic scenarios. Granted in this case its just a small town in Iowa that faces Armageddon but with a situation similar to the one represented in 28 Days Later its not hard to imagine the pandemic going global after the end credits roll. In tone if not in specifics The Crazies shares similarities with any of the countless ""zombie"" movies (especially those helmed by Romero) and a little-known little-seen 2009 B-movie called Carriers (which starred Captain Kirk-to-be Chris Pine). In short The Crazies is about as derivative as it can be but despite that the fast pace and generally sympathetic characters will keep most viewers interested at least until the final 30 minutes when it begins to wear out its reputation through a combination of repetition and inane plot contrivances. The movie opens with just another spring day in the small farming community of Ogden Marsh Iowa. The police station has been closed up so the sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) and the deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson) can attend the local high school baseball game. Just about the only one not at the game is Davids wife Judy (Radha Mitchell). As the lone doctor in town she has work to do. She is kind enough to let her assistant Becca (Danielle Panabaker) off early - her boyfriend is pitching for the home team. Things take an ugly turn when a dazed and uncommunicative man wanders onto the outfield with a shotgun. When he points it in a threatening way at David the sheriff has no choice but to take him down. This is just the beginning of a disturbing trend normal law-abiding citizens seemingly losing their minds and resorting to primal acts of violence. Eventually the military arrives to quarantine Ogden Marsh but by then the epidemic is out-of-control. The group of four survivalists - David Russell Judy and Becca - face danger not only from deranged townspeople but from trigger-happy soldiers and theres still cause for concern that one or more of them might be infected. The director Breck Eisner (son of Michael) shows an aptitude for creating ""Boo"" moments. Even though most of them are expected they provide the desired effect. Eisner also injects the flavor of ominous oppressive atmosphere that is mandated by entries into the horror/thriller genre. Little of what appears on screen during the course of The Crazies can be considered surprising - it follows a comfortable B-movie trajectory - but much of it is tense and competently crafted. The most original set-piece transpires in a car wash ends with a literal bang and allows for the wink-and-a-nod inclusion of a classic horror clichA(c). After that however the movie starts to get stupid. For some reason the surviving characters split up during the waning moments making them more vulnerable. Although this vulnerability decreases the likelihood of survival it also downgrades the viewers appreciation for their intelligence. Then again characters acting dumb is a horror staple. Even in Halloween Jamie Lee Curtis threw aside the knife before verifying that Michael wasnt going to get up again. Timonthy Olyphant who often plays psychos is cast against type here as the sanest character of the bunch. He is also surprisingly likeable. Theres not an iota of ""asshole"" in this performance and it goes a long way to getting us on his side early. Radha Mitchell who has been unceremoniously killed off in more than one of her previous ventures into this genre tries to survive to the end this time. David and Judy earn our rooting interest. Joe Anderson and Danielle Panabaker are less interesting primarily because they have less to do. Theyre the support to Olyphant and Mitchells leads. Romero and Wes Craven two icons of the horror industry are allowing many of their early works to be plundered for modern remakes. It must be gratifying for these men to achieve the mainstream acknowledgement that has not always been there; both have at one time or another been referred to as ""cult figures."" The Crazies like most of these remakes is a slicker production than the original but some of the grit is gone. The story is much the same but the experience is different. The Crazies is imperfect but its made with a degree of assurance that will limit fidgeting and keep most horror-lovers involved for a majority of its running length. Those who label themselves as being outside of this core viewership class will likely be less impressed by what The Crazies has to offer.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A zombie movie without any proper zombies George Romeros 1973 film The Crazies uses victims driven insane by governmental chemical-warfare experiments in place of reanimated corpses but otherwise looks like the missing link between Night Of The Living Dead and Dawn Of The Dead. Its not as strong as either of those classics but the way Romero pits insane everymen against a merciless military force while using images inspired by then-recent nightmares such as the Kent State shootings makes it a fascinating collection of early-70s anxieties. Breck Eisners remake briefly threatens to do the same for 2010. In a chilling echo of the public acts of violence that have become the stuff of everyday news it opens with a shotgun-toting madman walking onto the outfield of a baseball game and turning a bucolic small-town scene into a place of blood and horror. If only the film had dared to keep running in that direction. Instead it settles into a professional groove as an Iowa sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) and his doctor wife (Radha Mitchell) watch their neighbors go nuts while dozens of masked soldiers send their town into a violent lockdown. Whatever contemporary resonance it might have had even with the paranoid wingnut crowd gets lost in a procession of competent--and sometimes slightly better than competent--shocks. Eisners last film 2005s Sahara suggested he didnt have the chops to make a full-scale blockbuster but he clearly has an eye for eerie compositions and some intriguing ideas about how to create scares. Yet for every inventively staged scene--most notably a nightmarish trip through a car wash--The Crazies throws in a couple of the fake-out shocks and cheap jolts that have plagued modern horror movies for decades. Another problem The crazies themselves could be a lot more terrifying. Without the rotting ickiness of proper zombies they just seem like methed-out Iowans looking for a fix. Thats scary but not scary enough. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review A Prophet Next Movie Review Cop Out Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

"The Crazies Remake bests the master - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 3 1/2 starsThe Crazies Remake bests the masterRomeros germ-warfare thriller gets revived ably in IowaFebruary 25 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticOne of the years nicest bloody surprises the remake of the 1973 George A. Romero virus thriller ""The Crazies"" must be approached with the proper expectations. It should not be judged for what it is not. But nearly everything about it works. The low-budget spirit (and fact) of the Romero original which wasnt very original to begin with keeps this barreling B movie on track. Among other felicities director Breck Eisners virus-is-loose picture features an extremely tense scene set in a car wash. So you can check that off your list of things you never thought youd see in a horror movie. The location has moved from Romeros beloved besieged Pennsylvania to a farming community in Iowa. (The film was shot in both Iowa and Georgia.) First sign of trouble During the high school baseball opener a troubled townie in overalls carrying a shotgun walks onto the field looking as if hes about to kill someone. After a standoff with the sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) the man is shot dead. One by one in the next couple of days the good people of Ogden Marsh become murderous lunatics owing to a nearby downed plane carrying germ-warfare viral nastiness leaking straight into the towns water supply. As in Romeros Vietnam-era original the adversary is the U.S. government which after the craziness starts launches ""containment protocol"" leading to many many dead residents of the once-peaceable town. A trio of duck hunters turns into a ravaging pack of human slayers; in an excellent chaotic scene the local mortician goes nuts on the sheriff with some awful-looking cutting equipment. Romeros original version is a minor work in his major canon. I greatly prefer this cleverly sustained and efficiently relentless remake to the 73 edition. It is lean and simple and eventually becomes a tale of a quartet of survivalists against The Man and the zombie-like Crazies. The sheriff his pregnant doctor wife (Radha Mitchell above) the increasingly frazzled deputy (Joe Anderson) and the doctors teenage assistant (Danielle Panabaker) grind through one attack and counterattack after another yet the movie itself never becomes a grind. Eisner (""Sahara"" ) knows how to film a sport utility vehicle pulling into a gravel parking lot in a hurry without it looking like every other shot in existence. Cinematographer Maxime Alexandre keeps the palette ominously brackish and while editor Billy Fox has one too many whoops-I-scared-you moments to deal with even these come off with more wit and variety than usual. mjphillipstribune.com Rating 3 1/2 stars MPAA rating R (for bloody violence and language)Cast Timothy Olyphant (Sheriff Dutton); Radha Mitchell (Dr. Judy Dutton); Joe Anderson (Russell); Danielle Panabaker (Becca)Credits Directed by Breck Eisner; written by Scott Kosar and Ray Wright  based on the 1973 film; produced by Michael Aguilar  Dean Georgaris and Rob Cowan . An Overture Films release. Running time 141. Theres something in the airThis homage to the vision of George A. Romero is just the latest in a long line of films featuring a serum-weapon-cure gone wrong warping average humans into mindless murderers. Here are a few other favoritesNight of the Living Dead"" (1968) Romeros zombie career began with a burst of space-related radiation that inspires some Pennsylvania residents to dine on their neighbors. ""28 Days Later"" (2002) Animal rights activists free a critter infected with a mysterious rage virus which doesnt act any better than it sounds when it skips to humans. With Cillian Murphy and Brendan Gleeson starring this plague starts in England. ""I Am Legend"" (2007) Lots of humans die but its a German shepherd that jerks the tears as Will Smith attempts to find a cure for the night creatures impacted by an errant cancer cure.

Among the many early George Romero films tapped so far for remake ""The Crazies"" was perhaps the ripest candidate since the 1973 original had a great premise somewhat underserved by the film itself. While not a slam dunk this revamp by helmer Breck Eisner (of the enjoyable but underperforming ""Sahara"") emerges an above-average genre piece thats equal parts horror-meller and doomsday action thriller. B.O. prospects look healthy if unspectacular with strong ancillary biz to follow. Monsters of one sort or another may be a horror norm but theres always been something more deeply frightening about the notion of seemingly ordinary folk suddenly manifesting lunacy. The striking core idea in Romero and Paul McColloughs 73 screenplay was to turn a small town into a petri dish experiment in infectious insanity contaminated water turning citizens into homicidal maniacs who still looked like the folks next door. That version suffered from a low budget choppy editing some amateurish perfs and overemphasis on arguments between military personnel sent to contain the epidemic at any cost. Eisner and his scenarists (Scott Kosar Ray Wright) make changes mostly for the better ramping up the horror factor via tighter focus on the imperiled locals and the requisite hike in gory violence. Still purists may argue its counterproductive to make the infected unsound in body as well as mind their faces grotesquely marred and veined in the terminal stage. The first sign that something is wrong in placid Ogden Marsh Iowa arrives when Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) is forced to gun down a neighbor who grimly marches into the high school baseball teams season opener with a rifle. Soon afterward Dutton and Deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson) discover a large plane recently crashed in a nearby lake -- though rather strangely it wasnt reported missing -- and deduce its suspicious chemical payload polluted the water supply. More eruptions of irrational lethal behavior follow as the military swoops in to quarantine the population separating David and pregnant town-doctor wife Judy (Radha Mitchell). Its unclear at first whether this heavily armed force has invaded to save the locals or exterminate them thereby preventing the contagions wider spread. More tense than truly shocking or scary the pic does manage some good setpieces notably in the ward at a funeral parlor and during a most unpleasant ride through a car wash. (Strangely the filmmakers drop the originals most memorable bit in which a sweet-faced granny gets up from her rocking chair to stab an Army grunt with knitting needles. Sharp eyes however may recognize that pics cult thesp Lynn Lowry in a hymn-singing bicycle-riding cameo.) There are some plausibility lapses in behavior -- among the sane that is -- that succumb to routine horror convention. The script could have supplied a bit more human interest too as only Andersons increasingly trigger-happy unstable deputy makes a distinct impression. Other leads are certainly competent but character writing is on the bland side. Still this retooled ""Crazies"" delivers the essential suspense goods with overall skill and a modicum of intelligence. Pacing is generally tight sense of place sharp (though location shooting was split between rural Iowa and Georgia) tech and design elements well tuned.

Romero directed the original version of The Crazies about a small town whose residents go nuts after their water supply is infected by a biological toxin none of the movies Vietnam allegories could overcome the obvious similarities to Romeros flesh-eating ghoul classic Night of the Living Dead. The new version of The Crazies which has been made with infinitely more style and panache than the original feels even more derivative - the latest in a long line of apocalyptic horror pictures about viruses that turn people into zombies lunatics or some combination of both. In this case however familiarity does not breed contempt. Directed with great style and unusual restraint by Breck Eisner (who previously made the action dud Sahara but also directed a highly effective episode of the NBC anthology series Fear Itself) The Crazies has the feel of a Stephen King novel - and in fact often recalls his latest Under the Dome about a town that goes nuts after an invisible dome cuts it off from the rest of the world. In The Crazies a small Iowa town is sequestered by the military after the locals start acting in a bizarre way. At first theyre just a little spacey; soon theyre stabbing each other and blasting away with shotguns. Initially the sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) his pregnant doctor wife (Radha Mitchell) and the easygoing deputy (Joe Anderson) try to maintain peace and order. But once soldiers wearing gas masks swoop in and without asking questions start shooting everyone in sight the protagonists enter full-on survival mode and The Crazies becomes a game of every man for himself. Yes youve seen this movie before. But Eisner makes up for the lack of originality with some terrific setpieces such as a harrowing sequence in which the heroes are trapped inside an automated car wash. In another scene people suspected of being infected are strapped to gurneys inside a tent when a crazy wielding a pitchfork wanders in and starts poking. And poking. Olyphant an actor capable of playing stoic heroes as well as sneering villains anchors the movie with a believable sense of desperation and the brief film doesnt waste a second on anything that doesnt bear directly on the crisis at hand. The result is a terrific little B-movie in which the deaths of characters carry a real sting the gore is used sparingly but to disturbing effect and the editing has been paced at a speed that allows you to follow the action transpiring onscreen. Given the current state of the horror genre these qualities are not to be taken for granted. You may not remember The Crazies in a month but youll have a grand time watching it.
