Entertainment Jesse Eisenberg And Kristen Stewart Are Still Good Together In ""American Ultra"" The Adventureland pair reunite for a stoner action comedy thats just good enough for the lazy end of summer. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart in American Ultra. Lionsgate ID 6648337 When it comes to playing potheads some actors are naturals. Jesse Eisenberg for all his talents is not one of them as exemplified by American Ultra a sort of stoner answer to The Bourne Identity. The movie sees someone get killed with a spoon and the CIA running a program to turn criminals and people with mental illness into highly proficient killers and yet somehow the least believable element is that the neurotic high-strung intent Eisenberg is perpetually baked. The only aspect of his actorly high that feels genuine is the paranoia which within the auspices of the comedic action movie is totally earned.Eisenberg and his co-star Kristen Stewart are a lot more famous now than when they were first paired in Greg Mottolas nostalgic 2009 coming-of-age romance Adventureland. Stewart has weathered the insanity of the Twilight franchise and has been redefining her career with some ambitious interesting choices. Eisenberg got an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg as the quintessential millennial in The Social Network and hell next play Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice baddie Lex Luthor. But together their charms remain rooted in their abiding unaffectedness. Some people come across as larger than life onscreen but Eisenberg and Stewart dont. Theyre most eloquent in the beats between lines of dialogue and they never seem sure what to do with their hair. View this image > Connie Britton in American Ultra. Lionsgate ID 6648352 Eisenbergs innate twitchiness may run counter to the pleasant haze in which his character Mike Howell prefers to stay but his scenes with Stewart have a pleasant solidity that just manages to hold American Ultra together. Its a very August sort of movie the kind that benefits from low lax expectations in the same way that last weeks similarly secret agent-themed bit of fluff The Man from U.N.C.L.E. did for the few who saw it. Mike is the product of a canceled CIA program intended to train super soldiers. His memory was wiped and he was parked in a rundown West Virginia town where hes been living a low-key life employed at a convenience store while trying to work his way up to proposing to his infinitely patient girlfriend Phoebe (Stewart).Mike and Phoebe look more like slacker twins than a couple uncombed and T-shirted their biggest shared ambition to go to Hawaii for a vacation. Mikes the spacier of the two even after hes been reactivated by Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) his old boss. When one of the assassins sent to eliminate Mike by agency go-getter Adrian Yates (Topher Grace perpetually smarmy) yells mid-chase ""Wait"" Mike...stops and turns around.The movie which was directed by Project Xs Nima Nourizadeh and written by Chronicles Max Landis never really gets the timing of bits like this which should be funnier down right though they certainly get bloodier carnage unfolding in the town jail the den of the local drug dealer (John Leguizamo) and the supermarket. The actions just fine building up to one flashy long take featuring Walton Goggins as a killer named Laugher but the sight of Britton primly wielding an assault rifle is ultimately more rewarding than the choreography. View this image > John Leguizamo and Eisenberg. Lionsgate ID 6648354 American Ultra is loose and lazy even for comedy so deliberately wacky. Leguizamos character is a caricature the CIA plot is haphazardly explained and nonsensical and the pacing overall is herky-jerky. But as a love story the movie has a shabby but striking sweetness.What initially looks like a typical setup for a couple in a comedy like this -- as one character puts it Phoebe seems to serve as Mikes girlfriend mother and landlord -- is revealed to have a history and dynamic that goes much deeper. The two have little to their lives but theyve carved out a space of matching tattoos records omelets comic book ideas and cannabis for themselves thats a tangible touching oasis. The film may not aim for much but its further evidence that Eisenberg and Stewart are two actors who work very well together something no government plot or stoner gags can obscure.

Mike (Jesse Eisenberg) and Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) live in a ramshackle house in rural West Virginia. Hes an aspiring graphic novelist; she helps him through his panic attacks. But Mike--unbeknownst to himself--is the survivor of a failed C.I.A. experiment that turned him into a superhuman killing machine and when agency operatives arrive to dispose of him his skills kick into full gear surprising himself and his handlers alike and drawing Phoebe into the fray. Nourizadeh working with a script by Max Landis plays Mikes bloody violence like visual guitar riffs and approaches the martial-arts set pieces with heavily underlined wit. The pathos of hidden identities doesnt arise until near the end; Eisenberg and Stewart handle the action with aplomb but have little room for emotional maneuvering. Despite the spy-centered paranoia the films deepest backstory involves the cruel absurdity of drug laws.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

Photo Lionsgate Since being hurled under protest onto the A-list with the Twilight series Kristen Stewart has been the butt of critics and columnists whose commentaries call her ""mopey"" ""slack"" ""twitchy"" ""unwashed"" etc. The defense admits everything but the ""unwashed"" part -- Ive never been close enough to know. But just because her material is crap and you cant see her acting doesnt mean shes not the real thing. She was magnetic when mining her own discomfort in Olivier Assayass The Clouds of Sils Maria and she was indelibly in the momentA -- alert to every grim beat -- opposite Julianne Moore in Still Alice. I dont know that shes ready to play Hedda Gabler -- maybe someday. I just think shed just rather do things small than do them false. I loved watching her and Jesse Eisenberg in the new American Ultra. Its a smartly written dully plotted action picture about a druggie slacker who discovers hes not who he thinks he is. Its The Dork Identity. The movie evaporates in the mind but Stewart and Eisenberg have real movie-star chemistry. Eisenberg is a strange estranged actor. In the beginning of his career he played awkward gulping sweet kids. In The Social Network he began playing awkward gulping paranoiac assholes. In the first scene of American Ultra hes bloody and bruised and sitting opposite a police detective too broken to emote. His name is Mike Doyle and until the day before it was all he could do to pull himself out of bed to work at a convenience store his imagination manifest in a superhero graphic novel he was always sketching. Its adorable when he phones his girlfriend Phoebe (Stewart) to tell her about the latest plot turn and she drinks it in on the same page emotionally. Theyre a pair of wounded souls groping for something more stable. Directed by Nima Nourizadeh from a script by Max Landis (son of John) American Ultra has an unusual amount of wit and sincerity for something thats formula crap. After Topher Grace as a smartass overambitious CIA boss (hes modeled on a Hollywood agent not a spook) decides to ""clear the portfolio"" a conscience-ridden Connie Britton heads to the middle of nowhere to warn Mike of something terrible coming down. Eisenberg is amusing when he hears her code words (""Is that a lyric from something?"") and more so when -- under deadly threat -- his body begins to move with a dexterity that his conscious mind cant fathom instinctively turning ordinary objects into lethal weapons. The violence is ultrasplattery to compensate for the scenarioas ultrablandness but itas done reasonably well and Eisenberg is good at registering his sudden mind-body discontinuity. (For a while heas convinced heas actually a robot.) Walton Goggins adds a touch of unformulaic looney-tunes as a CIA-scrambled psychotic assassin. But thereas an extraordinarily stupid turn Stewartas Phoebe is kidnapped and handcuffed for the last third of the movie a all she has to do is make acidic comments about how terrible the CIA are and how theyare underestimating Mikeas resourcefulness. Literally the only thing that kept me happy and surprised was Stewart and Eisenbergas tricky rhythms together and when theyare wrenched apart the film has no reason for being. American Ultra is undemanding late-summer studio fare -- ultraforgettable. But Ill remember the faces of Eisenberg and Stewart who are easy to ridicule but whatever the pundits say very much movie stars. Their apparent directionlessness is in sync with their generation. Their transformation into action heroes is outlandish but for a while so comforting.

The action-movie absurdity is still in place but so is Landis muddy-bloody touch by the end Eisenbergs face is a purple swollen wreck and rightly so. Its not just gritty its grotty.

"Born in the USA Late-Summer Weirdness in Mistress America and American Ultra << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Born in the USA Late-Summer Weirdness in Mistress America and American Ultra Fox Searchlight Movies August 21 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Mistress America is a bad title for an amusingly off-rhythm lark of a movie. But it works as one for the television show that Brooke (Greta Gerwig) tells her future stepsister Tracy (Lola Kirke) she wants to create. Tracy hears Brookes breathy thematic explanation and cuts through the hot air ""Its like shes Americas girl on the side."" Tracy knows its kind of a clever line and probably wants Brooke to say so. Brookes annoyed instead insulted that her train of thought was almost derailed. But her thinking is like that Magritte painting of the locomotive chugging in midair out of an empty fireplace. The movie which Gerwig wrote with the director Noah Baumbach isnt far behind a screwball comedy the surrealists would marry. The setup is like something out of Victorian fiction just if everybody were from New Jersey. Tracys mother (Kathryn Erbe) is marrying Brookes father (we never see him) but the two daughters have barely met. So Tracy (who has just started college) calls Brooke whos 30 seems outwardly together and actually lives in Times Square which she knows is lame but is proud of anyway. (The first time we see her shes clomping down the glossy red steps of the TKTS theater-ticket stand.) Brooke takes Tracy to a concert and a house party -- she makes Tracy feel sophisticated which for some people also is a more valuable brand of cool. But Brookes life is a total self-contrivance and she loves it. Her business-class style and sense of decorum make her seem as if she fell out of a Princeton brochure -- or a Whit Stillman movie. But she has anticipated your judgy presumptions which is why shell tell you shes from Jersey and didnt even go to college and that shes self-taught and that really shes modern and downtown-minded ambitious and always -- always -- up to something tweeting while Instagramming overachieving while undermining. Theres a reason she doesnt appear to have any friends Shes exasperating. (Her sleazy-sounding boyfriend is in Greece doing deals.) Throughout all of this Tracy has been storing details about Brooke and cribbing lines until shes got a short story -- ""Mistress America"" -- that we hear Kirke read throughout the movie and that becomes the ethical centerpiece of the films second act. As for the plot the boyfriend dumps Brooke leaving her homeless and without a financial backer to start her business -- a restaurant/community center/hair salon. When a psychic tells Brooke to seek out an old friend she and Tracy decide to shake down Brookes ex-BFF Mamie-Claire (Heather Lind) for the money Brooke thinks shes owed for a lucrative T-shirt idea the friend stole. (The friend also took Brookes man.) So its off to Connecticut to the friends modernist fortress where the movies surrealism really takes over. Tracy brings Tony (Matthew Shear) a freshman suitor who basically stopped courting her right around the time she declined to critique a story he wrote. One day she runs into him and hes suddenly got a girlfriend insecurely jealous Nicolette (Jasmine Cephas Jones) who burns with intelligence and contempt for Tracy. Its his car theyve all piled into to drive to Connecticut where pregnant ladies reading Faulkner awkward business propositions a stunted chess match a peeved neighbor (Dean Wareham) and a handful of recriminations await. This kind of light random anti-realistic screwball comedy is hard to do well. The shouting and drunken scheming and coincidences can seem embarrassing because together they look unpolished or amateurish or unfinished. For instance a very pregnant character named Karen (Cindy Cheung) is forced to participate in the craziness at Mamie-Claires because her husband never picks her up. But arbitrariness is what Baumbach and Gerwig are after the illusion of chaos an unromantic dream. For anyone whos wondered how one of Luis Bunuels bourgeois farces might go in English its probably something like these scenes in Connecticut. This American version is comparably restrained. No one dies for instance. This is Baumbach and Gerwigs third film together -- the first theyve written together since 2012s Frances Ha. To quote Tracy to Tony This new movies ""just the same in another direction"" -- with much funnier dialogue and evocative electronic music by Wareham and Britta Phillips. Mistress America feels like something from 1986 or 87 something that abuts Jay McInerney and Bret Easton Ellis John Hughes and Martin Scorseses After Hours. The film starts out as a satire of effete college life -- Tracy and Tony write for and join the literary society which admits new members with a predawn pie in the face. Youre worried theyre going to push too hard to mock the youth of today. I was nervous that a shot of Tracys cracked iPhone screen was going to become some kind of Generational Statement but its possible Baumbach got all of that out of his system with While Were Young which was a hit for him in the spring. Hes still preoccupied with the ebb of youthfulness and the ache and fear of failure -- but Gerwig reduces his bitterness without losing sight of the narcissism that both as solo artists and a tandem is really their target. Authenticity and artistic truth are equally important to Baumbach in both of his 2015 movies. It just feels better explored from the point of view of an 18-year-old finding her way -- never mind that Kirke has the carriage and diction of a woman 10 years older (her sister is Jemima Kirke who plays Jessa on Girls). Really whats difficult about pulling off a movie like this is the fear of losing an audience because it looks like the director doesnt know what hes doing. This is how things can seem with Gerwig like shed never done any of this before. She never stops here -- moving self-aggrandizing insulting dazzling. Theres often no sharpness to the way Gerwig delivers a line. Shes not reading but shes also not talking the way most people do. So youre not sure how to relate and that foreign demeanor can be alluring the way it was with Melanie Griffith and Rosanna Arquette where you were sure they knew what was going on -- as performers and as human beings -- even if you didnt. With Gerwig you worry that she seems to be winging it -- until you realize that she also knows how to fly.  Lionsgate What is American Ultra about? The posters have Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart holding guns and theres an American flag. One tagline says ""Everyones getting smoked."" Another reads ""Meet the CIAs highest priority."" I rolled my eyes at that one -- really the CIA doesnt have anything better to do? But Id mis-rolled. Theyre the agencys highest priority because theyre high. Well theyre supposed to be high. We only see them smoke a couple of times but this is the sort of movie that has to keep telling you that these two are stoners long after their last hit. Anyway theyre also the CIAs highest priority because theyre sleeper agents. The first scene has Mike (Eisenberg) all bloody chained up in an interrogation room. What follows is all rewind. It turns out hes an assassin whom the government brainwashed stashed and now needs to exterminate. (The films title has something to do with the name of one of the CIAs programs.) The movie has the sleepy vibe of some of those scuzzy 90s crime thrillers. It aspires to Natural Born Killers but has barely enough competence to get close to something like Feeling Minnesota. Mike slogs away at a sub-7-Eleven convenience store somewhere in West Virginia. Hes worked up the nerve to propose to his girlfriend Phoebe (Stewart) but before boarding the flight to Hawaii he has a panic attack and they have to go home. Youre set up for a Bonnie and Clyde-style -- sorry Kalifornia-style -- killing spree and get a Bourne-esque kick- and karate-chop-athon. Mike narrates this movie -- more total 90s scuzz riffing (""We were the perfect fucked-up couple"") -- and has been arrested for possession a few times. One night he and Phoebe are on the hood of a car looking up at the sky. He lights a joint and the camera pans up into outer space to a satellite and then down to the CIAs building in Langley where Connie Britton and Topher Grace are trying to outmaneuver each other while poor Tony Hale stands there pretending to be stressed about having to operate a drone via laptop. What actually follows is embarrassment after embarrassment. It was probably fun for Eisenberg to train himself to execute Jason Bourne-level stunts. But its a chore to watch. Nighttime action sequences can look rushed and cheap. They can feel like a good cover for poor planning or general incompetence. The ones here achieve all of that. Director Nima Nourizadeh also made Project X a teen party comedy whose party has the grandeur of some movie-combat sequences. His big set pieces are a shootout in Mike and Phoebes cottage and another in a big-box store and theyre a mess. Some actual comedy does creep into the last couple of scenes. Nourizadeh and the credited screenwriter Max Landis finally figure out how to make the government stuff and the love story funny but its too late. And I cant see how you make comedy of this premise last for more than the one or two scenes here at the end anyway. Who knows what about this story interested the filmmakers? They dont even really seem to care about the pot. This wont spoil the high-quality year Eisenberg and Stewart are having -- The End of the Tour for him Still Alice and Clouds of Sils Maria for her. But these two make no sense together neither as friends nor as stoners in love. Britton Hale Bill Pullman Walton Goggins John Leguizamo Theyre worse than bad; theyre lost. No ones worse off than Grace though -- not in any American movie this year. Hes prissy bratty and shouty. During that last shootout he says to his henchmen of Eisenberg ""You two can you kill him please?"" By this point hes not acting anymore. Hes managing a Starbucks.

"American Ultra | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; american-ultra ) American Ultra (United States 2015) August 21 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Quentin Tarantino didnt originate the method of blending extreme violence with dark comedy but his early films (especially Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction) popularized it for todays generation. Since the early 1990s many directors have attempted to ape or adapt Tarantinos approach. A few have succeeded but most have not. American Ultra from Nima Nourizadeh the director of Project X and Max Landis the writer of Chronicle falls into the latter category. The movie is replete with bloody encounters sly asides and one-liners but the tone is awkward and uneven. There are also some serious structural problems that were supposed to brush aside. The concept of a seemingly ordinary person being an elite covert agent awaiting activation (Manchurian Candidate style) has become a popular movie trope. Its not hard to understand the appeal - it isnt that different from the orphan princess fantasy. What was once a fresh idea however has grown stale through repetition and the combination of Nourizadeh/Landis doesnt offer anything substantially new or interesting. The agent in question Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg) is living his life in a dead-end job in a dead-end town. He and his live-in girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) are stoners who seem content to meander through life. Her devotion to him is absolute - when panic attacks prevent him from boarding a plane for a romantic getaway to Hawaii she is able to forgive him. CIA midlevel manager Adrian Yates (Topher Grace) sees Mike as a security risk even though the agent doesnt know the truth about himself. Yates subordinate Victoria Lasseter disagrees and to save Mike from a hit squad she travels to the sleepy town where he lives and activates him. This leads to a predictable series of encounters in which Mike and Phoebe take down increasingly dangerous and difficult opponents while on a collision course with Yates and his inner circle. Landis screenplay employs a questionable wrap-around structure. It begins with Mike - bloody bedraggled and in chains - in an interrogation room being questioned by an official. Most of the story is then presented in flashback. Theres no particular reason why this approach is used but it deflates suspense and tension by letting us know that Mike survives the ordeal with little more than some cuts and bruises. Even more head-scratching is the filmmakers decision to ""fast-rewind"" events at the start of the flashback so we catch glimpses of key moments before they happen. Talk about self-spoilers In Pulp Fiction Tarantino challenged us to laugh at some of the most bloody disgusting things. (Remember when the gun went off in the car providing John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson with a gory shower?) Nothing in American Ultra is quite that outrageous but Nourizadeh and Landis want to play in this park. For the most part however they fail to blend the extreme action elements and the comedic ones in a satisfying way. Transitions are jarring and instances of dark humor often seem more inappropriate than clever. As a side note American Ultras vision of the CIA is odd to say the least. Theres no requirement that a movie - especially one as off-the-wall as this one - adhere to a realistic depiction of the agency but the presentation is so preposterous that it can be distracting. The screenplay postulates that Yates a midlevel manager is able to carry out rogue assassinations without oversight and no one challenges him when he makes threats. His boss (Bill Pullman) hangs around in the shadows. And it appears as if the CIA employs more psychopaths than it does agents. If theres a praiseworthy element in American Ultra its the interaction between actors Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart.  Re-igniting the chemistry they showed in Adventureland the two make for believable lovers. Having thankfully moved on from the Twilight movies Stewart is again displaying the strength of performance that defined her early career.  Eisenberg is credible as a stoner-cum-action hero. Connie Britton is less effective as Mikes lone champion within the agency.  Topher Grace John Leguizamo (as Mikes drug dealer pal) and Walton Goggins (as a laughing assassin) do their share of scenery-chewing. As misfires go American Ultra can at least claim not to be boring. After a slow beginning the narrative accelerates to a breakneck speed and most of the action sequences while featuring unsparing shots of carnage and mayhem are clearly presented. The likability of the characters gets viewers through some of the less inspired moments but the film as a whole feels overplotted and the unwieldy push-pull between comedy and violence hurts the production more often than it proves to be an asset.

Again so much for originality.Happily there are differences between the two. ""American Ultra"" carries the sheen of a romantic stoner comedy (nothing funnier than seeing a guy get killed with a spoon) while ""Hitman"" based on a video game goes for a more sci-fi Bond type of vibe.""American Ultra"" also features the not inconsiderable talents and chemistry of Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart while ""Hitman"" relies on the lesser-known but perfectly adequate Rupert Friend (""Homeland"") and Hannah Ware. Both films are rated R one runs 95 minutes the other 96 and each boasts big-tussle high-quality villains as well -- the incomparable Walton Goggins in ""American Ultra"" and Zachary Quinto in ""Hitman.""Actually its unclear for a while who the villain is in ""Hitman."" We find out early that the titular Agent 47 (Friend) has been genetically bred and trained to be an assassin and hes very good at his job. Hes part of a program that was discontinued when a geneticist ran off with his young daughter taking the secrets to making hitmen with him.Fifteen years later the daughter (Ware) Agent 47 and a nasty international corporation that wants to make more hitmen are all looking for the geneticist (Ciarin Hinds). A fellow named John Smith (Quinto) suddenly appears alongside the daughter warning her 47 is coming to get her. After much gunplay and hysterics he whisks her off to safety. Until 47 shows up again and it turns out he just wants to release her inner hitwoman.This is all followed by gunplay gunplay and more gunplay all handled in glossy tones by first-time director Aleksander Bach. As such films go its efficiently done juvenilia.""American Ultra"" is obviously aiming a bit higher while still embracing low-brow silliness. Mike (Eisenberg) works at a convenience store in a small town where he lives with his beautiful punkish girlfriend Phoebe (Stewart) the both of them in a consistent bong haze.Then one night two thugs try to kill Mike in the stores empty parking lot whereupon to his own great surprise he kills them both with a cup of ramen soup and a spoon. What is happening? He calls Phoebe they go on the run and its revealed that Mike was the only successful product of a CIA experiment to transform wayward youths into super killers.Now a CIA honcho has turned a squadron of repurposed madmen led by a loony called Laugher (Goggins) loose on Mike. Can he survive? Hint He killed a guy with a cup of soup.Like the pros they are Eisenberg and Stewart bring a refreshing amount of sincerity to the bloody antics and ""Project X"" director Nima Nourizadeh handles the literal fireworks with a sense of glee. You never fully buy ""American Ultra"" -- youre not supposed to -- but its a decent ride with some nice turns.If only the ride didnt feel so familiar.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongHitman Agent 47GRADE C+Rated R for sequences of strong violence and some languageRunning time 96 minutesAmerican UltraGRADE BRated R for strong bloody violence language throughout drug use and some sexual contentRunning time 95 minutesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1LnXddV MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/08/21/movie-review-tom-long-american-ultra-hitman-bodies-everywhere/32095821/,200,americanultra6,americanultra,detroitnews

The movies a bit of a stitched-together creature too. Its all eye and no heart. Yes its got wall-to-wall style from nearly subliminal memory montages to an extended sequence played out under black light (which you know makes no one look good.) But its also so carelessly violent so guiltlessly sadistic that its hard to get any real enjoyment out of it. You can tell that Max Landis enjoyed writing the script which starts with a ""Bourne Identity"" style gimmick about a top-secret agent with amnesia. Thats Jesse Eisenberg and for five years hes been very happily living a small-town stoners life hanging out with girlfriend Kristen Stewart and working at the local convenience mart. Except one day the sleeper wakes. Just in time too as theres a new middle-manager at the CIA whos recently decided its time to retire this little ""asset."" Permanently. The casual pothead profundities are funny and Eisenberg and Stewart - who were so good together a few years back in ""Adventureland"" - have a nice lazy rhythm together. Its never very clear why the CIA suddenly wants him dead but the two young stars - plus a typically manic John Leguizamo as their dealer - make the film worth watching. Until you have to start looking away. Because thats when director Nima Nourizadeh -- who made the similarly extreme party movie ""Project X"" - starts hauling out the guns and gore and wont stop. And suddenly the film is filled with hitmen shaking with explosions dripping with blood and pausing for such niceties as a spoon to the carotid artery and a cleaver to the face. Sure its all done ""stylishly."" But you could film a slaughterhouse stylishly. That doesnt mean that anyone would particularly want to watch it - or that this mindless mayhem has anything to do with the low-key humor that began the film or the goofy concept of a James Bong superspy. Eisenberg and Stewart are good in their scenes together; less effective are Connie Britton and Topher Grace as a couple of CIA bosses. The settings (filmed in small-town Louisiana) have an authentically humid down-home feel at least and the druggy hallucinations are well shot. It all ends - is this a threat? - with the promise of a franchise. I just wish there was a little more feeling and a little less flash. And a lot more of Landis dialogue and a lot less of what feels like Nourizadehs audition for an even bigger dumber movie. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence gore sexual situations strong language and substance abuse. American Ultra (R) Lionsgate (90 min.) Directed by Nima Nourizadeh.

Lionsgate/TNS Chris Vognar Culture Critic chrisvognar cvognardallasnews.com Holy smokes Ultraviolent comedy American Ultra is fast on its feet (B+) Aug. 20 2015 551pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... On Facebook With Chris Vognar Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh The ultraviolent comedy found its patron saint in the 1990s with Quentin Tarantino who inspired an unfortunate abundance of imitators (call them Reservoir Pups). Weve seen some passable entries since including Grosse Pointe Blank (hit man goes to his high school reunion) and Pineapple Express which brought the strain of weed into the mix.Thats where we find American Ultra the new stoner CIA-assassin-brainwash romantic comedy that gets credit for knowing exactly what it wants to do and then doing it with a blend of brute force and surprising tenderness. Fast on its feet and eager to skip unnecessary exposition Ultra is a kick from the moment its slacker hero (Jesse Eisenberg) begins to realize he is in fact a trained killing machine. Yes American Ultra could have been called The Bong Identity. Eisenbergs Mike Howell passes his time in a small West Virginia town with his girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) smoking a lot of weed and suffering from severe panic attacks whenever he wants to go anywhere. Then one night near the end of his convenience store shift he fends off a couple of assassins killing one of them with a spoon. This seems creative at the time until the movie progresses and he takes someone out with with a dustpan. Mike is nothing if not a model of utilitarianism. The film is written by Max Landis son of horror-comedy alchemist John Landis and it playfully stuffs in references to The Terminator Blade Runner The Manchurian Candidate the Bourne movies and other favorites. If its a pastiche its a lively one with its own rhythm and twists. Ultra works by making a potentially messy story rather simple and by using its carnage as an extension of its comedy. It has no interest in piling on plot minutiae. Its too busy getting to the next bit of mayhem.But for all that violence - and theres quite a bit - American Ultra flashes a vulnerable side throughout. Eisenberg plays Mike not as a stereotypical stoner but a troubled tightly wound guy who needs to relax. Stewart showcases her rare ability to class up action and genre fare by actually acting. When Mike and Phoebe wrestle with loyalty memory and identity they act as if they really mean it. Their relationship provides ballast to balance the rest of the movies craziness.The supporting cast sinks its collective teeth into a collection of vivid comic-book characters. Among those who appear to be having a blast Topher Grace as an evil CIA stuffed shirt (Grace would make a fine Batman villain); Walton Goggins as a mental patient-turned-CIA asset called The Laugher; and Connie Britton as Mikes maternal but steely agency protector. In this image released by Lionsgate John Leguizamo left and Jesse Eisenberg appear in a scene from ""American Ultra."" (Alan Markfield/Lionsgate via AP) Alan Markfield/AP All the chaos comes to a head with a climactic showdown at a discount store where the kitchenware aisle proves particularly lethal. By then if the spirit of American Ultra hasnt grabbed you you will have long since checked out. But if youve stayed with Mike and Phoebe to that point youre in for the long haul.Just stay away from the silverware drawer when you get home. AMERICAN ULTRA (B+)Directed by Nima Nourizadeh.

Photo Credit AP / Alan Markfield advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A mild-mannered stoner discovers hes actually a CIA super-agent. Rated R (graphic violence language). BOTTOM LINE An amusing idea but the ugly violence and weepy dramatics effectively kill any comedic buzz. CAST Jesse Eisenberg Kristen Stewart Connie Britton LENGTH 136 Stoner comedies are funny. Action comedies are funny. So why arent stoner action-comedies funny? Not many have been made so perhaps we dont have a representative sampling. In 2008 ""Pineapple Express"" featured Seth Rogen and James Franco as amiable bong-tokers who run afoul of a criminal gang. In ""American Ultra"" which arrives in theaters Friday Jesse Eisenberg plays a pot-smoking slacker who discovers hes actually a trained assassin. Each movie gets its comedic mileage from the incongruous mix of mellow dudes and spasmodic violence. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break That has potential for fun and fantasy. ""American Ultra"" casts Eisenberg the twitchy actor who played Mark Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network"" as Mike Howell a highly unlikely super-agent. Hes a West Virginia convenience store clerk who draws comics (or just thinks about drawing them) and lives with his alt-culture girlfriend Phoebe played by a mostly sidelined Kristen Stewart. Together theyre happily going nowhere. That changes when Mike is attacked by two thugs. Quicker than you can say ""Special Ops"" he reduces them to broken bones and splattered brains but there are more coming. Over at CIA headquarters Agent Lasseter (Connie Britton) has been keeping Mikes identity a secret -- even from him -- but now the power-hungry Agent Yates (Topher Grace) wants Mike dead. The stage is set for thrills and spills as our dweeby hero discovers his inner James Bond. Except thats not what happens. After introducing John Leguizamo as a kooky drug dealer ""American Ultra"" forgets about its marijuana motif and quickly turns dark. Mikes mental confusion is played for pathos not laughs and his love for Phoebe is oddly riddled with anguish. The violence is too ugly to be funny (sledgehammers as a rule do not equal comedy) and the complex narrative delves too deeply into the sad cynical territory of a John Le Carre novel. These are such major problems that Eisenbergs miscasting -- hes too naturally high-strung to play a space-case -- seems like a minor point. 236 MoviesAmerican Ultra trailer Directed with an ice-cold eye by Nima Nourizadeh (""Project X"") and wildly overwritten by Max Landis (son of the film director John Landis) ""American Ultra"" seems confused easily distracted and irrationally emotional. Only in that sense does this stoner movie live up to its theme. advertisement | advertise on newsday ----- FOUR MORE ALL AMERICAN MOVIE TITLES Youd never know by its title that the new movie ""American Ultra"" is about a stoner/government agent whos marked for extermination. But its not the first ""American"" movie in which the title gave little evidence regarding the plot. MoviesBest movies of 2015 AMERICAN MADNESS (1932). Though it sounds like it could be a horror movie the ""Madness"" in Frank Capras Depression-era classic refers to run on a bank after its robbed of 100000. Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff AMERICAN GRAFFITI (1973). Thinking the name suggested an Italian movie or a feature on feet Universal boss Ned Tanen wanted the movie retitled ""Another Slow Night in Modesto."" Director George Lucas refused and somehow audiences figured out this was a 1962-set slice of life about college-bound buddies. AMERICAN HOT WAX (1978). The title suggests a movie about spa treatments rather than a biography of 1950s DJ and rock music pioneer Alan Freed. Tim McIntire played Freed but it was Fran Drescher as his wisecracking secretary and Jay Leno as his limo driver who went on to bigger things. AMERICAN PIE (1999). This raunchy comedy about teens out to lose their virginity had nothing to do with Don McLeans hit record about the deaths of rockers Buddy Holly Ritchie Valens and ""The Big Bopper"" in a 1959 plane crash. However those expecting to see an apple pie werent disappointed. -- Daniel Bubbeo MoviesBig movies out this summer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"Review Stoner spy-thriller American Ultra needs more dope smarts and humor - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Stoner action-thriller American Ultra needs more dope smarts and humor American Ultra Lionsgate Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart in ""American Ultra."" Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart in ""American Ultra."" (Lionsgate) Mark OlsenContact Reporter Those who enjoy the recreational use of marijuana -- stoners as they are commonly known -- are often thought to be a listless inactive bunch. Mellow one could say. Which makes the idea of a high-energy action film centered on some stoners seem while not without precedent funny.The notion of ""American Ultra"" as a freewheeling stoner-centric action/espionage comedy with two of the sharpest young stars of the day seems pretty much a no-brainer. The bummer of the movie turns out to be that it was made with little brains at all. It turns out to be a disappointingly underdeveloped film that its makers chiefly director Nima Nourizadeh and writer Max Landis must have thought could coast by on a cool but half-baked idea. Whatever. Close enough. The story revolves around the characters of Mike Howell and Phoebe Larson played by Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart two of the brightest and most compelling young performers working in and around Hollywood. Stewart and Eisenberg are both capable of conveying intelligence emotion and inner life. The duo previously appeared together in ""Adventureland"" Greg Mottolas sweet understated 2009 comedy and a film that put them both to better use. Some of that movies best moments are the two of them together gently stoned talking and just hanging out.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; ""American Ultra"" is set chiefly in a small town in West Virginia where Mike works in a convenience store and Phoebe answers phones at a bail bonds place. They are quite genuinely stuck there as he suffers from crippling anxiety attacks whenever they try to go anywhere else. See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link One day Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) arrives unbeknownst to Mike as his former CIA handler and the person who oversaw a secret government program of which he is the last surviving member one that made him a super-agent in waiting. Lasseters program was surpassed by one overseen by the smarmy ambitious Adrian Yates (Topher Grace) who will stop at nothing to have Mike killed deploying excessive government resources and firepower to do so. Knowing the relentless cruelty of Yates on her own Lasseter activates Mikes abilities and soon a battle has begun. American Ultra | Trailer Watch the trailer for ""American Ultra"" starring Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg Watch the trailer for ""American Ultra"" starring Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg See more videos Once Mike is activated as a sleeper agent the film largely dispenses with being much of a stoner comedy and shifts into a pretty straightforward on-the-run action picture. Whether Mikes years of copious weed intake in any way impacted his neurological training is unexplored even as he grapples to understand whats happening to him.Also the idea of a stoners inherent paranoia although it may soon be a thing of the past because of changing drug laws across the country isnt used for much. If youre constantly nervous that everyone is looking at you suspiciously imagine discovering everyone is in fact after you. Stewart and Eisenberg seem to be enjoying themselves well enough playing off their sometimes sleepy on-screen personas but as the film becomes more conventional their performances by and large do as well. After his first fight in which he kills two men without realizing quite how he did it Eisenberg hilariously tries to hide behind a pole and then nervously prance-walks his way across a parking lot. Its the sort of eccentric move that is missing as the story goes along.Walton Goggins plays the films chief henchman a weird psycho given to disturbing laughing fits -- and it is the movies idea of wit that his character be named Laugher. John Leguizamo plays Rose Mikes drug dealer and friend -- that line can sometimes be blurry -- and the veteran character actor is expected to fill in the underwritten role with an out-there look and wacky ticks.Nourizadeh previously made the raw riotous teen party movie ""Project X"" but there is little of that films energy here. Landis created the teen-focused superhero story ""Chronicle"" but is arguably now as well known for his brash social media persona as for his screenplays. The action set-pieces and the comedic character scenes in the film seem to be taking turns and are rarely brought together in a meaningful way. While the storys smoke-filled lungs would presumably be powered by an anti-authoritarian heart that turns out to be asking too much.A dramatic moment for Laugher seems cut-and-pasted from another story. A sequence in Roses drug den/sex playroom shot in psychedelic black-light day-glo feels like a lift from better-done sequences in ""Spring Breakers"" or ""Neighbors"" and an attempt to paper over the movies deficiencies of story and action. A standoff finale that combines machine-gun laser-sights helicopter spotlights and an emotional turn finally captures the sort of disorienting hallucinatory feel very much lacking in the rest of the film.It is unfair of course to judge a movie in relation to its marketing but in the case of ""American Ultra"" it is actually instructive. The movie being sold to audiences is bold and lively the movie showing in theaters is something inert needlessly mean more harshly violent than funny and largely a waste of its two young stars.""American Ultra"" could be goofier and crazier both smarter and dopier than it turned out. (As well as in need of better drug jokes.) The movie winds up like a crummy bag of weed that looks better than it is and brings more of a woozy headache than a true high.Follow me on Twitter at IndieFocus and subscribe to my Indie Focus film newsletter----------------American UltraRated R for strong bloody violence language throughout drug use and some sexual contentRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesPlaying In wide releaseMORE Kristen Stewart and Taylor Lautner reunite at American Ultra premiereDigging for Fires Rosemarie DeWitt I wasnt a good ingenue How Jason Mitchell went from unknown actor to Eazy-E in Straight Outta Compton Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment Jesse Eisenberg Kristen Stewart Topher Grace Taylor Lautner The Indie Focus podcast series Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad78deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-american-ultra-review-20150821-story.html,200,americanultra10,americanultra,latimes

Credit Alan Markfield/Lionsgate Some of the many many promotional spots for ""American Ultra"" make it seem like more of a comedy than it is. Thats not said as a criticism just a warning. If you go expect a diverting summer action adventure with occasional laughs not a diverting stoner comedy with occasional action.Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart who were paired in ""Adventureland"" in 2009 are romantically linked again here though when we first meet their characters its a romance shrouded in a haze. Mr. Eisenberg is Mike Howell a perpetually stoned young man with a job at a grocery store that seems to have no customers. Ms. Stewart is his girlfriend Phoebe whom he wants to marry and in his clearer moments hes trying to find a way to propose. Video Movie Review American Ultra The Times critic Neil Genzlinger reviews ""American Ultra."" By SOFIA PERPETUA and ROBIN LINDSAY on Publish Date August 20 2015. Photo by Alan Markfield/Lionsgate. Watch in Times Video >> embed Mike is so wasted most of the time that it doesnt seem odd to him that he has no memories of his childhood or how he ended up in the ratty West Virginia town where he lives or anything else. Theres a reason for this Hes a remnant of an old C.I.A. experiment to create superagents and he was placed there memory-free when the experiment was shelved. He begins to figure this out when an agency bureaucrat (Topher Grace) decides that ""were clearing the portfolio"" and sends assassins to kill him.That awakens Mikes long-buried training and hes the one who does the killing. A lethal-weapon character who doesnt realize his powers until a crisis brings them out -- youve seen the conceit before and youll see it again if you watch the new NBC series ""Blindspot"" next month. Thats a problem with ""American Ultra"" a lot of it seems familiar and Mr. Eisenberg and Ms. Stewart arent stretched much. But Mike finds amusing ways to defend himself using ordinary household items Walton Goggins and John Leguizamo enliven things in goofy small roles the plot has a nice twist or two and your theater is probably air-conditioned.""American Ultra"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Strong language lots of blood and of course drug use.

"American Ultra and Hitman Agent 47add up to the boring identityreviews | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAmerican Ultra and Hitman Agent 47add up to the boring identityreviewsAmerican Ultra and Hitman Agent 47 movies working the same brainwashed assassin angle as The Bourne Identity both open this weekend. Neither do much to inspire further imitation.Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart team up in American Ultra.Rupert Friend and Hanna Ware get cracking in Hitman Agent 47.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Aug. 20 2015American UltraStarring Jesse Eisenberg Kristen Stewart Topher Grace Connie Britton and John Leguizamo. Directed by Nima Nourizadeh. Opens Aug. 21 at GTA theatres. 96 minutes. 18ASince the blockbuster success of The Bourne Identity and its sequels (plus The Manchurian Candidate a generation earlier) the concept of a brainwashed agent/assassin has become the hoariest of action tropes.Which explains why two movies working this angle American Ultra and Hitman Agent 47 are being off-loaded in the same week in these fading days of summer. Neither does much to inspire further imitation.Article Continued BelowAmerican Ultra at least has the novelty of reuniting Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart who were more happily paired for the 2009 indie rom-com Adventureland.Here theyre ""the perfect f---ed-up couple"" in the fictional West Virginia backwater of Liman which not so coincidentally shares a name with Bourne director Doug Liman. Eisenberg is Mike a shaggy-headed and perpetually stoned convenience store clerk and avid cartoonist. Stewart is Phoebe the devoted and only slightly baked girlfriend who keeps everything together. Maybe theyll get married if Mike can overcome his constant anxiety to pop the question.Theyre no big deal in other words. So why does weird stuff keep happening like two carjackers exploding into gore at the spoon-wielding hands of Mike who is astonished by his lethal ninja skills with cutlery?""Theres a chance I may be a robot"" he tells a disbelieving Phoebe.No Mike is just the result of a CIA superagent experiment gone awry and now the agency led by a scheming bureaucrat (Topher Grace) wants to shut er down as you would a broken snow cone machine.Director Nima Nourizadeh (Project X) and scriptwriter Max Landis (Chronicle) could have gone for the laughs in this inhaling assassin scenario paying homage more to Pineapple Express than The Bourne Identity and its imitators. There are a few chuckles but not enough.Instead they take the path most travelled with Connie Britton John Leguizamo Tony Hale Walton Goggins and Bill Pullman along for the ride and a lot of blood smearing the trail. American Ultra has its moments but its mostly a waste of good weed and better actors.Hitman Agent 47Starring Rupert Friend Hannah Ware Zachary Quinto Ciaran Hinds and Thomas Kretschmann. Opens Aug. 21 at GTA theatres. 96 minutes. 14AWhos human and whos not consumes much of the running time of rote actioner Hitman Agent 47 which vainly attempts to revive a forgotten video-game spinoff starring Timothy Olyphant.The real head-scratcher though involves rookie director Aleksander Bach and screenwriters Skip Woods and Michael Finch. Are these guys for real?With bog-level plotting as it hopscotches across Europe and Asia and such cliched dialogue as ""You cant run from who you are"" and ""You and I arent so very different"" its as if the robots were running the asylum.Homelands Rupert Friend dons a Rodney Dangerfield suit and red tie and resists cracking a smile as the factory-made title killer with a bar-code tattoo. Hes the 47th rendition of a mad scientists (Ciaran Hinds) designer hit man project endowed with super skills but zero personality.Agent 47 is chasing after the scientists daughter Katia (Hannah Ware) for reasons that become obvious long before theyre revealed courtesy of overused whiplash flashbacks and foreshadowing. Another interested party (Zachary Quinto) is working his own kill-by-numbers agenda all of it involving many bullets shattered glass and exploding buildings.The worst insult in this movie is to call somebody ""a failed experiment.""The same thing can be said about the movie although its an experiment weve seen too many times before.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsDundas St. W.s Fugo Desserts serves up a smores coneIf you cant make it to a campfire this summer this treats for youNewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Alan Markfield/Courtesy of Lions Gate Films hide caption toggle caption Alan Markfield/Courtesy of Lions Gate Films Mike (Jesse Eisenberg) and Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) are a pair of potheads in American Ultra. Alan Markfield/Courtesy of Lions Gate Films Within the mishmash of influences on the stoner action/comedy American Ultra -- namely Repo Man Mr. and Mrs. Smith Pineapple Express and a pile of pointless hyper-violent comic books -- the film nearly finds itself in the cognitive dissonance of a pothead who discovers his inner badass. Theres something funny about Jesse Eisenberg that sentient bundle of nerves standing over the bodies of government agents hes just dispatched with a spoon and a piping hot bowl of ramen noodles. The movies have offered plenty of weaklings-turned-heroes but American Ultra teases something like an out-of-body experience scoring early laughs off the gap between Eisenberg the Fruity Pebbles muncher and Eisenberg the laser-focused killing machine. He greets his own carnage with a tokers uncomprehending stare. Once the marijuana smokes clears however American Ultra loses that shred of novelty and becomes a glib juvenile exercise in violence for its own sake squandering the lived-in vibe between Eisenberg and his co-star Kristen Stewart. Eisenberg and Stewart got a head start on their romantic chemistry in Adventureland an 80s nostalgia piece that cast them as amusement park employees who turn to each other out of boredom and lust. They pick up where they left off here as Mike and Phoebe a pair of layabouts in small-town West Virginia who seem mostly content with getting baked and spinning their wheels. Mikes panic attacks keep them penned in but Phoebes disappointment over a failed trip to Hawaii is short-lived -- shes happy enough to be stuck in their little rut. As they soon discover however Mike isnt a weak-stomached convenience store clerk but a sleeper agent in a secret CIA program thats been discontinued. When a sniveling young muckity-muck (Topher Grace) in Langley decides to close the book on the program and eliminate him Mikes original training officer (Connie Britton) risks treason in an effort to protect him. So begins a military siege on a one-horse town that seems populated only by Mike and Phoebe a few policemen and John Leguizamo as an all-purpose dealer of narcotics fireworks and other contraband. Screenwriter Max Landis tips his hat to Repo Man by conceiving Mike as a lowly clerk wrapped up in a government conspiracy but the comparison does American Ultra no favors. Gone is the punk spirit that animated Repo Man replaced by a protagonist who represents nothing and stands for nothing and a CIA that has no clear reason for starting the secret agent program or for ending it. At best the film functions as a shaggy-dog adventure with Mike and Phoebe improvising their way through a situation that grows more absurd by the minute. But for long stretches Landis and director Nima Nourizadeh (Project X) forget theyre making a comedy at all and allow bloody pointless mayhem to take over. American Ultra joins a recent spate of comics-inspired actioners like Kingsman The Secret Service and the two Kick-Ass movies that go out of their way to divorce their cool-for-the-sake-of-it shootouts from anything resembling a theme or purpose. Eisenberg and Stewart give the film some humor and heart in its quieter moments but once the cavalry comes to town those moments are few and far between replaced by the sound of heavy artillery and shouting. Its more a cocaine movie than a pot movie a buzz-harshing thrill-ride that feels as dissociated from the low-key promise of its opening minutes as Mike the super-agent feels from himself. His reaction is ours Why is this happening?

A guilty pleasure through and through.John Leguizamo and Jesse Eisenberg star in ""American Ultra.""(Photo Lionsgate)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3.5 stars out of 5Deep stoner thoughts usually are best left to mingle with bong resin and the crumbs in a ravaged Cheetos bag. Such thoughts as What if this is all a government conspiracy? What if were being watched right now? What if Im like a robot?Screenwriter Max Landis (son of filmmaker John Landis) fashions such paranoid stoner ramblings into the barest skeleton of a plot and fleshes it out with explosions arterial blood spray and general mayhem. ""American Ultra"" is doodles in a math-class notebook given a budget and although its frequently as stupid as it sounds its amiable enough to pass the bowl around.AZCENTRALConnie Britton brings action laughs in American UltraThat ""American Ultra"" works as well as it does is a testament to its two lead performances. Jesse Eisenberg plays Mike an aimless but friendly pot-smoking clerk at the Cash-N-Carry convenience store in dead-end Liman W.Va. the sort of place where hope and ambition go to die.His partner in crime (literally and figuratively) is longtime girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) a small-town dream girl with seemingly endless patience for Mike his screw-ups and the crippling panic attacks that keep him trapped in Liman even when he has a pair of plane tickets to Hawaii and an engagement ring burning a hole in his pocket.Their romance is vulnerable tender. The first act you root for these kids for Mike to get his act together to propose to get as far away from Liman as possible. And then he kills a guy with a spoon.AZCENTRALThese 10 hit-man movies are right on targetThe transition into high absurdity is as jarring for the viewer as it is for Mike whose transformation from amiable screw-up to secret government superweapon couldnt be any more wild a shift in tone. Behind the scenes his CIA puppet masters are in a state of chaos. The man in charge (Topher Grace) wants to neutralize (that is kill) the threat while his chief dissident (Connie Britton) who still has some measure of respect for human life wants to give the kid a chance. Eisenbergs trademark manic energy serves his paranoid stoner well as the hallmarks of a bad buzz prove all too real.There are more than a few false notes gumming up the works from scenes that ramble on long past their welcome to grating side characters who cant die gruesome deaths quickly enough. But everything else is a pure hit of guilty pleasure.AZCENTRALAmerican Ultra (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsExcept for the romance. As absurd and parodic as every other element in the film is Eisenberg and Stewart play their romance so straight with such clear-eyed devotion that you never quite forget that engagement ring sitting heavy in Mikes pocket even when hes killing a guy with a spoon.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

A blackly funny spoof of -- among other things -- the infamous CIA mind control program of the 1960s American Ultra stars Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart as a pair of underachieving slackers living in Hicksville West Virginia. As Mike Eisenberg is a hopeless stoner. He smokes a ton of weed and works at a local convenience store. His panic attacks prevent him from leaving town or doing much of anything. Mind you he doodles a very cool space-travelling ape for his own amusement and its just too bad Mike isnt motivated to do more with his drawing talent. Stewart plays Phoebe the somewhat more capable girlfriend. Mike and Phoebe dont appear to have much going on but theyre in love. The plot thickens. Turns out Mike is actually part of a failed CIA experiment. Hes been trained extensively in weapons and combat which we discover by accident when he finds two strangers tinkering with his car and he has various mental and physical abilities that have been kept dormant. And then those abilities are awakened. Its all paranoia and conspiracy like a stoners worst nightmare come true. And thats all we should say about that so as not to ruin the experience of this absurd and entertaining movie. American Ultra benefits from an excellent supporting cast which includes Topher Grace John Leguizamo Connie Britton and Walton Goggins all of them playing faintly ridiculous characters. Terrific dialogue is another of the movies attractions as are its general energy and an overriding sense of silliness. American Ultra eventually becomes ultra-violent but the action/adventure component is so cartoonish that you may find yourself laughing out loud at arsonists and assassins. Theres also a sweet-natured romantic element to the tale and its surprising how well Eisenberg and Stewart create odd-couple chemistry. They are a perfect match for deadpan delivery - something we first saw when they worked together on 2009s Adventureland. Over-the-top appears to have been the guiding philosophy at work throughout American Ultra. Its a manic approach that works well with a bucket opopcorn and air conditioning in these dog days of summer.

"American Ultra reviewed The Jesse Eisenberg vehicle turns Jason Bourne into Jason Bong. Its not enough. Slate Sign In Sign Up American Ultra Turns Jason Bourne Into Jason Bong. Is That Enough? American Ultra Turns Jason Bourne Into Jason Bong. Is That Enough? Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 20 2015 321 PM American Ultra The Jesse Eisenberg vehicle turns Jason Bourne into Jason Bong. Puff puff pass. By Seth Stevenson Jesse Eisenberg stars in American Ultra. Courtesy of Lionsgate When Sergio Leone cast Henry Fonda as a villain in Once Upon a Time in the West the actor was best known for playing humble good guys and soft-spoken sweeties. So Fonda attempting to look like ""a son of a bitch"" arrived on set with brown contacts over his baby blues and a ruffians moustache atop his upper lip. Leone was displeased--it was precisely the gentleness of Fondas face that hed been planning to exploit to jarring effect. When Fondas character killed a helpless child in one famous scene Leone made sure to focus on those kind blue eyes. Seth Stevenson Seth Stevenson is a frequent contributor to Slate. He is the author of Grounded A Down to Earth Journey Around the World. What azure peepers were to Fonda jittery discomfort is to Jesse Eisenberg who is forever twitching and glancing shoe-ward. In a review of this summers The End of the Tour--a film in which much of Eisenbergs dialogue is punctuated by nervous joyless bursts of laughter--New York Times critic A.O. Scott theorized that the actors ""genetic material is at least 25 percent weasel."" Advertisement From his callow teen jerk in The Squid and the Whale to his implacable Zuckerbot in The Social Network theres long been a dickish undercurrent to Eisenbergs performances. One presumes hell dust off similar moves when he plays cerebral supervillain Lex Luthor in next years Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice. But in the new action-comedy movie American Ultra Eisenberg engages in some Fonda-ish shtick-flipping--a trick not unlike the one hed previously pulled in 2009s Zombieland. He makes no effort to hide his halting demeanor but instead of snappish and guarded here it comes off as sweet and vulnerable. Likewise his dorky body language (all inward cant concave chest pigeon toes) still defines him visually. But now its deployed as a juxtapositional joke--as when Eisenbergs character Mike trembles and mewls after he skillfully snaps the neck of an enemy. Just as The Big Lebowski transformed the Philip Marlowe archetype into a bumbling stoner American Ultra turns Jason Bourne into Jason Bong. When first we meet Mike hes a small-town convenience store clerk with a prodigious pot habit. Hes a mess of a guy who cant cook an omelet without setting his kitchen on fire. Hes continually disappointing his devoted girlfriend (played with orange-dyed hair and a flannel wardrobe by Kristen Stewart) before puppyishly begging her forgiveness. Then one day Manchurian Candidate-style Mikes hidden telos is activated when a visiting stranger recites a string of nonsense phrases. Turns out Mike was a dormant CIA sleeper agent--trained in the murderous arts--whose memory was wiped and replaced with a benign cover story. Now he suddenly finds himself brimming with tradecraft secrets able to summon martial arts moves and firearms expertise. Soon hes on the run from CIA heavies determined to neutralize their rogue asset. Can Mike escape their clutches even as he fires up yet another joint? We initially wonder why K-Stews character has shackled herself to this deadweight dude as the two mope around their house listening to records and toking up (their exhalations bolstered with thick CGI clouds of smoke). But then the film posits an appealing fantasy for every woman whos felt stuck with an aimless bumbling man Dont worry girl just say the magic words and hell magically morph into a hypercompetent superspy. American Ultra is all genre send-up with not just Eisenberg but his fellow actors playing off their established personae. Connie Britton uses her maternal vibe to become a caring but tough CIA handler. (""Are you my mom?"" a confused but hopeful Eisenberg asks her at one point.) Topher Graces constipated milquetoast mien serves him well as an evil agency bureaucrat. Tony Hale best known as Buster on Arrested Development brings the silly to a small but funny role. The cast is game. Stewart in particular gives her all evincing genuine emotion when her on-screen boyfriend is in peril. She seems like shes in a better movie than the one on the screen--one where the relationships and the stakes actually feel real. In the end American Ultra is doomed by its nondescript script. Cheeky action spoofs are a dime a dozen these days. Even relatively straight modern spy films like Kingsman The Secret Service and The Man From U.N.C.L.E. knowingly wink at their audiences. A mere clever conceit isnt enough and here the action smells stale and the humor staler. Theres no explosion we havent seen before no quip that feels fresh and new. I suggest you save American Ultra to stream on a lazy snow day this winter--even then the deep sleeper who needs to be awoken might be you.

Photo Lionsgate MOVIE REVIEW American Ultra Running time 96 minutes. Rated R (drug use violence language). Like its shaggy protagonist (Jesse Eisenberg) much of ""American Ultra"" is half-baked. What begins as a clever action-comedy a la ""Pineapple Express"" or Eisenbergs earlier ""Zombieland"" devolves into a standard shoot-em-up with gore splashed around to distract us from the dearth of wit. Its a missed opportunity as Eisenbergs twitchy anxiety-riddled Mike Howell is a perfect Bourne for our twitchy times. A small-town convenience-store clerk he hangs out with his undemanding girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) smokes dope and suffers panic attacks every time he attempts to leave town. When a mysterious woman (Connie Britton) shows up at his mini-mart uttering a string of code words -- ""Is that a lyric from something?"" asks Mike -- hes suddenly instinctively capable of dispatching two assassins in the shops parking lot armed only with a Cup O Noodles and a spoon. Mikes left blinking in bewilderment killer reflexes at odds with his gentle demeanor. Its a funny conceit and Eisenberg nails it but Max Landis screenplay yields diminishing returns. Stewart meanwhile has too little to do as Mikes loyal voice-of-reason girlfriend who may have her own secrets. As the pair flee a series of hit men we learn that a weaselly CIA suit named Yates (Topher Grace) wants to terminate Mike a former sleeper agent whos become a liability. Grace is opposed by Britton as the head of the discontinued program that created Mike and the two butt heads as director Nima Nourizadeh (""Project X"") cuts between the stoner couple and the bureaucrats trying to catch them. Kristen Stewart and Jesse EisenbergPhoto Lionsgate Grace all middle-management snark makes a nice baddie counterpart to Eisenberg in what boils down to a Battle of the Beta Males. But the film gets sloppy as it rolls out his characters secret army of psychopaths featuring Walton Goggins (""Justified"") as a creepy killer code-named Laugher. Even for a spy agency Yates off-the-books creation of a lethal team of former criminals seems a little ridiculous (though fans awaiting DC Comics ""Suicide Squad"" film may beg to differ I guess). Likewise the program that created Mike is never explained in any specificity leaving it at ""things went wrong."" One of the draws of the sleeper-agent narrative is a reveal of the heros back story so its perplexing that Nourizadehs film isnt more curious; his movies not satirical enough to earn a pass on that front. As if to drown out your questions the director doubles down on the heavy artillery and the body count picking off innocent bystanders in Mikes West Virginia town as if theyre cardboard shooting targets. John Leguizamo (left) and Jesse EisenbergPhoto Lionsgate John Leguizamos amusing as Rose Mikes heavily inked weed dealer who harbors and then imprisons the couple in his lair while hyperventilating about the outbreak of ""monkey disease"" -- a cover story spread by the CIA to justify its closure of the town. A sequence in Roses Day-Glo black-lit basement as Mike and Phoebe attempt to break out is visually stylish (and boy do those kids have white teeth) if not that compelling actionwise. Tony Hale plays it relatively straight as Brittons mild-mannered co-worker and Bill Pullman pops in for a welcome cameo. But the film flubs its best assets -- Eisenberg Stewart and Grace -- who dont get to play up whats most entertaining about their characters. Mike spends more time in droopy existential quandary than he does in hand-to-hand combat or stoned befuddlement finding his footing only in the films brief coda. I walked out feeling Id been sold a cinematic bag of oregano.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint They say pot makes you paranoid. In Mike Howells case apparently not enough. Mike (Jesse Eisenberg sporting his worst hairdo ever) is your average small-town doobie-rolling slacker whose only ambitions are to draw monkey comics and marry Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) his true love and partner in weed. That is until he finds out hes the takedown target of highly trained government assassins that he used to be one of them and that he can waste a dude with a spoon. Mikes assets are deemed no longer necessary by CIA boss Adrian Yates (an improbably sinister Topher Grace) who gives orders to terminate him. Sympathetic fellow agent Victoria Lasseter (Connie Britton) charges up Mikes dormant powers and tries to warn him while hes pulling down a night shift at the dollar store. But its not until he has dispatched a couple of guys sent to kill him that he starts to realize something is awfully amiss and hed better channel his rusty skill set fast. In addition to Grace and Britton the supporting cast is a whos who of known TV and film names. Walton Goggins John Leguizamo Tony Hale Lavell Crawford and Bill Pullman all pop up romping their way through supporting roles with relish (except for Pullman whos been a sullen screen presence since ""Independence Day""). But the brightest star of this picture is screenwriter Max Landis who pulls off a masterful mashup of action comedy and romance with bits of animation tossed in. In lesser hands fledgling director Nima Nourizadeh could have ended up with a real mess. But together the two manage to bend genres into something that feels new even if a few too many action scenes in a row flatten out the middle. American Ultra  out of 4 stars Rating R for violence language drug use sexual content. It might seem impossible to squeeze tender loving moments between all the sarcasm and surreal mayhem. But the romance part works largely because of the easy intimacy between Eisenberg and Stewart reunited after their first pairing in 2009s ""Adventureland."" Her laid-back laissez-faire demeanor is a perfect foil for his nervous nerdy energy. ktillotsonstartribune.com 612-673-7046 StribKristin View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

EntertainmentMovies American Ultra Jesse Eisenberg lights up this tale Originally published August 20 2015 at 1205 am Updated August 20 2015 at 720 am Jesse Eisenberg a stoner-assassin and Kristen Stewart who plays his girlfriend star in ""American Ultra."" (Alan Markfield) Movie review of ""American Ultra"" Jesse Eisenberg is funny as a small-town stoner who is in reality and unbeknown to himself a top CIA assassin but the film misses opportunities and opts for gore and cartoonishness. Rating 2.5 stars out of 3. Share story By Erik LundegaardSpecial to The Seattle Times You can imagine the studio pitch ""Bourne Identity"" meets ""Pineapple Express."" Small-town stoner is in reality and unbeknown to himself a top CIA assassin. The surprise is how sweet ""American Ultra"" can be. The tenderness in some of the early scenes took me by surprise. But then gore and general cartoonishness took over. Mike Lowell (Jesse Eisenberg) lives in the dying town of Liman W.Va. (an apparent homage to ""Bourne"" director Doug Liman) where he gets high eats Fruity Pebbles and sits on the hood of his car with his girl Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) and tells her the further adventures of his creation ""Apollo Ape"" which he cant bother to write down. Movie Review 1/2   American Ultra with Jesse Eisenberg Kristen Stewart Topher Grace Connie Britton John Leguizamo. Directed by Nima Nourizadeh from a screenplay by Max Landis. 96 minutes. Rated R for strong bloody violence language throughout drug use and some sexual content. Several theaters. He works at the local Cash amp; Carry and looks for the perfect moment to propose to Phoebe. He also cant leave Liman. Physically. He gets anxiety attacks and throws up. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

VIEWMicrosoft says its planning to lay off 2850 by end of fiscal yearUnlimited Digital Access. 1 for 4 weeks.Turns out this is part of his programming. Mike is the last remnant of a CIA program that turned three-time offenders into assassins but which is now part of an internecine struggle between its creator Victoria (Connie Britton) and middle-management jerk Adrian Yates (Topher Grace) who has his own program code-named ""Tough Guy"" that turns psychopaths into assassins. After Yates seeks to eliminate Mike Victoria activates him but some of Mikes mental wiring is frayed. When threatened his pupils dilate and his inner assassin takes over; then he reverts back to the vulnerable slacker. He kills two people with a spoon for example then needs a hug from Phoebe. ""I have a lot of anxiety about this"" he says surveying the damage. Eisenberg makes the most of this dichotomy and his rapport with Stewart his co-star from 2009s ""Adventureland"" is touching and believable. But there are missed opportunities and unanswered questions. How much of the stoner Mike is the real pre-CIA Mike? A mid-movie reveal dampened rather than deepened my interest while the CIA here is over-the-top calling in drone strikes on American shopping markets. Its Eisenberg who anchors things. Essentially the stoner/assassin is the movies least cartoonish element. Erik Lundegaard elundegaardcomcast.net Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights delivered weekday mornings.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Convenience store clerk Mike (Jesse Eisenberg) is living the stoner dream with his girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) until his killer secret is revealed in ""American Ultra."" (Alan Markfield/Lionsgate) By Michael OSullivan August 20 2015 Jesse Eisenberg is becoming more and more like Wallace Shawn every day. I dont mean physically but temperamentally He rarely strays from characters who are perturbed angsty neurotic or driven in a broken sort of way. So its one of the small pleasures of ""American Ultra"" to see him play against type a young man who appears to be a stoned-out convenience-store clerk in small-town West Virginia living with his pothead girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart). That twitchy character -- who suffers from incapacitating panic attacks -- is anything but mellow. Even at his most baked Eisenbergs Mike Howell comes across at his core as haunted by something. Thats because Mike isnt really a spaced-out druggie after all. What he really is -- which Ill refrain from saying -- is equally incongruous. Its not a huge surprise The film makes it pretty obvious only a few minutes in when Mike kills two thugs in the parking lot using only a spoon and hand-to-hand combat straight out of ""The Bourne Identity."" Whats best about ""American Ultra"" is the giggly absurdity of Eisenbergs casting both in terms of what Mike is and what he only seems to be. This conspicuous disconnect also is unfortunately the movies greatest weakness. Directed by Nima Nourizadeh (""Project X"") from a script by Max Landis (""Chronicle"") ""American Ultra"" misplays its cards early by clueing viewers in to what is secretly going on in a way thats both unsubtle and unsatisfying. If you havent figured out the twist by the time a women in a trench coat and sunglasses (Connie Britton) walks into Mikes store and says apropos of nothing ""Mandelbrot set is in motion echo choir has been breached were fielding the ball"" youre either not paying attention or you may have picked up a contact high from all the onscreen smoke. Another small example of the films inability to let the audience figure things out As Mike sits staring at an engagement ring he has bought for Phoebe as if to say ""I wonder if this could be the right moment"" the character says out loud ""This could be the right moment."" Just how baked do they think we are? As for the rest of the cast John Leguizamo is a fun diversion as Mikes dealer but Topher Grace wears thin in a role that has him striding around in a suit barking obscenities at commandoes who like the movies first two victims keep trying to kill Mike for reasons never adequately explained. Landiss script is far from witty and the violence quickly becomes excessive. ""American Ultra"" has a clever premise. But it misses several opportunities to at least comment on if not skewer the spy movies that it only halfheartedly pokes fun at. As it is its content to generate a low-grade buzz rather than deliver a true high. ""Do you feel sick?"" Phoebe ask Mike at one point (which judging by the look on his face he does). ""No"" Mike replies ""I feel kind of amazing."" But the way Eisenberg renders that line -- like the movie itself -- is anything but. R. At area theaters. Contains violence obscenity drug use and mild sensuality. 97 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Jesse Eisenberg is the perpetually stoned Mike and Kristen Stewart is his girlfriend Phoebe in ""American Ultra."" Photo Lionsgate McClatchy-Tribune News Service Put bluntly American Ultra is an entertaining ride 1 / 2 Back to Gallery As much as ""American Ultra"" works as a stoner action-comedy the film benefits from its excellent end-of-summer timing. Its like that early-morning trip to a waffle house after a long party where your meal tastes better because its 2 a.m. and everyone is in the right mood. Sometimes a waffle is just a waffle. And other times its something more. Get used to philosophic ramblings because there are a lot of them in the dialogue of ""American Ultra."" But the screenplay is deceptively tight even as the main characters seem to be buzzing aimlessly through the proceedings. Like the most successful films of the drug-hazed genre this movie only appears to be going off the rails. ""American Ultra"" is directed by Nima Nourizadeh who made the even more party-centric ""Project X"" in 2012. The newer film has a clearer narrative attempting to squeeze a ""Bourne Identity""-style thriller between bong hits. Unlike ""Project X"" you could take away the substance abuse and still have a movie left over. Jesse Eisenberg is Mike a clerk at an all-night market who smokes an alarming amount of marijuana every day and is prone to panic attacks. His more focused girlfriend Phoebe played by Kristen Stewart seems to take care of him as much as romance him. (Eisenberg and Stewart renew their chemistry from the underrated ""Adventureland."") When a threat comes to their small West Virginia town Mikes hidden identity as an elite CIA agent is unlocked and he thrillingly kills two men with a cup of ramen. From there the plot twists and body count seem to rise in equal number. ""American Ultra"" doesnt aspire to much more than a good time and the brutal violence dark humor and endless pot consumption sets a high (pun intended) bar that many moviegoers wont be able to overcome. I predict that the audience members who see the film a second time will outnumber the moviegoers who walk out of the theater in disgust but not by much. Being blunt (that one was also intentional) the script appears to have been written while high to the point where the audiences own consumption works like a secret decoder ring. An altered state is almost necessary to accept a movie that spends so much time entertaining you in the moment and so little time caring about the backstories logic of the bad guys motives and ramifications of our heroes actions. But its all quite fun to watch thanks in large part to the script by Max Landis whose ability to find humor in the middle of a crisis meshes well with Nourizadehs kinetic directing style. The movie compares favorably with Doug Limans ""Go"" another late-night waffle run of a movie that didnt let the modest budget and lack of big set pieces kill its momentum. (In what is almost certainly a nod to the ""Go"" and ""Bourne Identity"" director ""American Ultra"" is set in the fictional town of Liman W.Va.) Eisenberg is a good choice for the lead effectively selling a character with a Hulk-like ability to turn from a kindhearted stoner into a brilliant killing machine and then wrestle with his actions in the aftermath. Standing out in the deep supporting cast Topher Grace and Connie Britton as CIA rivals and John Leguizamo as a drug dealer who cant believe he was left out of Mikes fantasy football league. One more thing in favor of this film At a time when action movies and comedies routinely exceed two hours and the last two ""Transformers"" movies were longer than ""Out of Africa"" ""American Ultra"" enters theaters at a lean 96 minutes.

Share Tweet In American Ultra--a stoned occasionally gruesome riff on The Bourne Identity flavored with a touch of First Blood and Burn After Reading--a small-town pothead lives blissfully unaware of his past as a brainwashed super-soldier programmed by the CIA to be able to kill anyone using anything. Then an intra-agency power struggle results in a termination order and within a few hours our hapless hero finds himself in the parking lot of the Cash-N-Carry having just killed two black-ops gunmen using nothing more than a dull spoon and a cup of ramen noodles with no understanding of how he did it or why. Operating within the logic of severely stoned paranoia he concludes that he must be a robot. Arriving in theaters in the dog-day dumping ground of August American Ultra is one of those geeky genre mishmashes thats very clever about being dumb. Written by Max Landis (Chronicle) the movie takes a one-joke premise--""What if Jason Bourne couldnt remember his past because he was baked all the time?""--and gives it more layers of shading than a viewer probably has any right to expect. Nima Nourizadehs direction skews eclectic overhead shots extreme telephoto close-ups quasi-ironic slow-mo sequences digitally composited long takes. The violence is exaggerated into explosive blood spurts and doors ripped apart by gunfire--the stuff of scrappier genre fare in which the viewer gets hooked on the fun the filmmakers must have had in making it. Its demented occasionally inspired and often very funny.But oddly the one thing American Ultra isnt very good at is being a straightforward action flick despite a conceptually spot-on climactic set piece that finds Mike Howell (Jesse Eisenberg sporting luxuriant hair extensions) dispatching a small army of goons using whatever he can find on the shelves of a big-box store. Perhaps this is the inevitable trade-off of opting for an actor who could credibly play an anxious stoner over one who could play a world-class killer. As Eisenberg awkwardly elbows his way between stuntmen the only thing that registers is the goofiness of it all--which is sort of the point. In a minor coup of casting Topher Grace plays the antagonist effectively pitting against each other two actors who have a knack for playing beta-male pricks. Given a temporary promotion CIA careerist Yates (Grace) decides to make his position permanent by offing Mike the only survivor of his predecessors pet program. Mike has been living for the past five years in a fictional West Virginia community of Liman (one of the movies more obvious nods to its source material) prevented from leaving by severe panic attacks that are actually the product of a brainwashing failsafe. He spends his days working the register at a convenience store and doodling violent comics about a NASA test chimp named Apollo Ape--expressions of his repressed past as an assassin.Whatever free time he has he spends with Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) his long-time girlfriend with whom he shares a dumpy bungalow-style house a set of matching tattoos and a preference for spending every day in a haze of pot smoke. Somehow the dynamic between the two--defined by the comfortable body language of the actors and by a few unexpected notes of eroticism--feels more credible than most on-screen relationships in recent memory; who knows whether that speaks more to American Ultras particular qualities or to the state of mainstream American film as a whole. What should by any right be nothing more a corny through-line (see the engagement ring Mike carries around waiting for the right moment) becomes something like an honest-to-God emotional center.If American Ultra has one big trick up its sleeve its these small gestures of nuance. It turns a cackling maniac henchman into a figure of uneasy sympathy and rarely misses an opportunity to remind the viewer that the uniformed goons Mike is facing arent there by choice. Yates and Mike are doubles both going against their superiors. In the movies anti-authoritarian worldview--which is complicated by an ending that could either be interpreted as cynical or a cop-out--which side youre on ultimately comes to the question of how willing you are to follow an order you dont agree with and why.

VPCKristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg star as a slacker couple in the action comedy ""American Ultra.""(Photo Alan Markfield) 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREAmerican Ultra is the kind of altered-states entertainment that its characters would watch joints and junk food in hand if one of them didnt wind up being an ultra-violent secret agent.A lot Bourne and a little bong the action comedy (1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) is too earnest to be a stoner movie and too quirky to be an action flick. Therein lies the beauty of director Nima Nourizadehs Ultra It exists to entertain in its own oddball universe munchies optional.USA TODAYEisenberg Stewart seek Ultra sanityJesse Eisenberg stars as Mike Howell a slacker guy living with his devoted slacker girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) in small-town West Virginia. An avid indoorsman and homebody Mike has a panic attack every time he tries to leave their rural locale with the latest attempt being to go to Hawaii for a romantic getaway.He just thinks its his usual jittery nature -- or maybe the engagement ring hes been carrying around -- but theres something shadier at play. Mike is actually a failed CIA experiment to create a well-trained killer operative a fact that one rather villainous government agent named Adrian Yates (a foul-mouthed over-the-top Topher Grace) now wants to eliminate permanently.Not wanting to see Mike die his former handler (Connie Britton) visits him at his convenience-store gig and utters a few key code words to flip the proverbial switch on the sleeper agent allowing Mike to dispose of bad guys with his bare hands and use anything around him like a marijuana-loving MacGyver. For him a metal spoon for ramen noodles and a random kettle bell might as well be objects of mass destruction.USA TODAYAmerican Ultra 5 things we learned at the premiereFull of fireworks black-light home gyms and fantasy football the smartly written script by Max Landis (Chronicle) deconstructs action-movie tropes alongside explosive set pieces while also taking a jab at American paranoia. There are sparks of weird genius but the plot loses some momentum at key times straddling that stoner/spy line.Eisenberg and Stewart have a nice real chemistry as Mike and Phoebe Hes always screwing up theres a reason why shes loyal to him and theyre an enjoyably odd couple to watch as theyre avoiding the various CIA assets that Yates sends to take them out. John Leguizamo is fun as Mikes sensitive drug dealer and Walton Goggins has a great supporting role as a laughing henchman lacking teeth.American Ultras biggest problem is that it just cant decide whether it wants to be a ridiculous B-movie or not. (Be sure to stay for the credits for the trippiest visuals of the entire film.) Some scenes play it straight then others have Eisenberg shooting a gun and careening the bullet off a perfectly airborne frying pan with the latter being the sort of high youre more apt to enjoy. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1NHiX1O",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/08/20/american-ultra-movie-review/32009807/,200,americanultra24,americanultra,usatoday

Movie review American Ultra Article Tweet Lionsgate Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart in American Ultra American Ultra    Director Nima Nourizadeh Cast Jesse Eisenberg Kristen Stewart Rated R (strong bloody violence language throughout drug use sexual content) Running time 95 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 209pm on Thursday Aug. 20 2015 Thursday Aug. 20 2015 Thursday Aug. 20 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Jesse Eisenberg usually plays geeky and studious not gallant and studly. Hes Mark Zuckerberg not Jason Statham.But he gets to stride both sides of the street in the disposable yet mildly enjoyable American Ultra a riff on the spy-movie formula where tongues are kept firmly in cheek.Hes Mike Howell a stoner working at a convenience store in a small West Virginia town who has little going for him except his girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) and the comic book hes creating about a simian astronaut ( Apollo Ape). Then his life gets a lot more interesting -- and much more violent -- when the CIA puts a hit out on him.As it turns out he has had a much more colorful life than most would believe though he doesnt remember any of it. Now one high-ranking agent the ambitious Adrian (Topher Grace) wants him out of the picture and another (Connie Britton) is trying to keep him alive. Meanwhile when hes attacked Mike finds out he has killer kung-fu and action-movie skills he didnt even know he had.Director Nima Nourizadeh working from a script by Max Landis keeps things moving briskly though nothing here is as crazily over-the-top as in Nourizadehs last film Project X (2012) a movie about an out-of-control party that inspired a spate of out-of-control parties. Project X had a vibrant memorable look especially in those party scenes and theres nothing as striking here.But the vision of one of the governments bad guys named Laugher (excellent character actor Walton Goggins Justified) trying to talk after his front teeth are beaten out of his mouth by Mike counts as one of American Ultras small pleasures. Speaking of beatings American Ultra is quite violent despite the overall jocular tone.It just goes to show that just because its an Eisenberg movie it doesnt mean that youre not going to get Zuckerberg and Statham.

Post an ad Great performances boost American Ultra By Katie Walsh Tribune News Service August 21 2015 Updated August 21 2015 at 420 am 0 Caption + In this image released by Lionsgate Jesse Eisenberg left and Kristen Stewart appear in a scene from ""American Ultra."" (Alan Markfield/Lionsgate via AP) A soup spoon turns lethal in the unlikely hands of sweet and spacy stoner Mike (Jesse Eisenberg) in the violently paranoid action comedy ""American Ultra."" Mikes a lot like the spoon - harmless unless deployed in the right way - because he used to be a particularly effective ""asset"" at the CIA a term used to describe highly trained super-killers. But the program was shut down Mikes memories replaced with serious phobias and he was planted in a sleepy West Virginia town with a girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart). These days his only experience with the law is regular visits from the local PD due to his conspicuous marijuana habit.When a young upstart at the CIA Yates (Topher Grace) decides to permanently terminate Mike his old boss Victoria (Connie Britton) goes rogue to save him - activating his deeply buried talents which prove useful for evading the team of assets Yates has sent in hot destructive pursuit. A madcap murderous chase ensues as Mike lays waste to every super soldier sent his way - as shocked as everyone else at his own bloodthirsty efficiency.The voice of screenwriter Max Landis who also wrote the enjoyable ""Chronicle"" comes through clearly the screenplay peppered with dumb-funny lines that are slyly smarter than they appear. Mike is particularly funny in his dumbfounded realization of his abilities which he processes with all the neuroses and worry of a peaceful pothead aghast at his own actions. Directed by ""Project X"" helmer Nima Nourizadeh the saturated colors quick edits and crisp sound design create a heightened reality to match Mikes newly heightened senses which cant be dulled even by the massive amounts of cannabis he ingests.What buoys ""American Ultra"" are the performances and the casting director must be commended for putting together a group of talented actors who bring real emotional stakes to their characters. Eisenberg and Stewart are perfectly matched and her performance is a warm reminder that Stewart released from the chains of ""Twilight"" is a remarkable actress. You really do believe in their love and want these kids to make it.""American Ultra"" is shockingly violent. Characters are machine-gunned down without a moments hesitation digital blood and bullet holes exploding across the screen. The violence though feels of a piece with the nihilistic and paranoid world view of the film and the cognitive dissonance between Eisenbergs sensitive scaredy-cat and the bloodshed he inflicts is at the core of the films humor.In a cast stacked with MVP performers including Britton Tony Hale and Walton Goggins John Leguizamo is a standout as Mikes wild and wacky drug dealer Rose. Grace also turns in a deliciously jerky performance as the entrepreneurial young CIA upstart who goes too far above his station.This is a deeply weird film - in the best way - and feels incredibly of this particular moment. Theres at once intense paranoia about a nefarious shadowy murderous spying government coupled with a streak of liberal libertarianism. Mike just wants to get stoned be happy and have the government leave him alone embracing the 60s ethos of ""turn on tune in drop out."" Ultimately the humanist nature of the film doesnt allow that to fully happen but its a heck of a lot of fun watching Mike figure that out.

Stoners discover why people are trying to kill them. Director Nima Nourizadeh (136) R Violence language. Area theaters. ""American Ultra"" is a very American-style actioner that needed more ultra. This stoners-meet-government-assassins mashup is as meandering and paranoid as a guy toking up in front of City Hall. Sometimes thats amusing but most of the time its tiring. The only way to roll with it is to appreciate Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart who feel twitchy as this skittish movie goes from loving 420 to loving the action series ""24."" Were introduced to Mike Howell (Eisenberg) as he sits in police detention. Howd he get here? In voice-over Mike explains that he and his smoky-eyed girlfriend Phoebe (Stewart) dreamt of leaving the small West Virginia town where he works at a convenience store. But every time they try Mike gets panic attacks. Turns out thats because Mike was once part of a supersecret CIA program called Ultra which gave young people wildly inventive assassin skills. Trained as a killing machine Mike has no memories of his past until a slick bureaucrat (Topher Grace) aims to get rid of all evidence of Ultra. Alerted to the threat by Ultras founder (Connie Britton) Mike and Phoebe have to get out of their haze and focus on survival. For Mike that means finding new ways to waste his enemies like with a spoon and a steaming hot cup of soup. Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart in ""American Ultra"" (Alan Markfield/lionsgate) Max Landis script is reminiscent of the one his father John Landis did for ""Into the Night"" in 1985. This sleeper-agent story has a few twists that wont be given away here. The movie plays best as a genre riff though its less reliant on pot jokes than the goofballs in ""Pineapple Express."" Mike and Phoebe are essentially slacker kids with dead time on their hands until they have guns thrust into them. Director Nima Nourizadeh doesnt give Eisenberg and Stewart much to do when the action slows down and it often does. Eisenbergs mostly wasted -- thats wasted as in having not much to do -- but hones the action reflexes needed to play Lex Luthor in next years ""Batman v Superman Dawn of Justice."" To see Eisenbergs greatest work get to his other current film the terrific ""The End of the Tour."" Stewart is also coming off a career-best performance in ""Clouds of Sils Maria."" She must have relished not having to look like she cared much about what was happening. Amid all the noise spy shtick and gunshots the movies ""True Romance""-like energy needed something to keep it churning. Eisenberg and Stewart both work off a crazy kind of anti-charisma which can often be intoxicating. Here though surrounded by drone attacks and explosions it all kinda feels dopey. jneumaiernydailynews.com Follow me on TWITTER  NeumaierMovies Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

In a summer film slate awash with reboots sequels and dutifully box-checking superhero product its refreshing to see a genre film made from a completely original screenplay. Yet ""American Ultra"" a stoner action-comedy directed by Nima Nourizadeh from a script by Max Landis too often plays like an earnest yet unsatisfying adaptation of a cult graphic novel with most of the charm lost in translation. Full of clever ideas bloody violence so cartoonish that its almost cuddly and an eminently likable leading pair in Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg the film has a lot going for it but like a fridge-clearing omelet prepared after too many bong hits it cant manage to cook all these goodies into a palatable whole. Box office should be modest though more couch-bound demographics may well embrace it on homevid. For a well-meaning not-so-bright stoner who works at a run-down mini-mart and cant leave his West Virginia hometown without suffering panic attacks Mike Howell (Eisenberg) is rather content with his lot in life. He lives in a rainbow-shag-carpeted house with his beloved Phoebe (Stewart looking completely at home with stringy hair and a faded violet dye job) who doesnt seem to mind functioning as Mikes ""girlfriend mother maid and landlord"" in the words of an uncomprehending local sheriff. His comicbook concept Apollo Ape seems like it could be a winner if only he would take the time to actually write it. Hes even somehow scrounged up enough dough to buy Phoebe an engagement ring though the opportunity to pop the question keeps comically eluding him. Nourizadeh does well to build up the loose ambling rhythms of Mikes life in the opening reel making it all the more striking when hes accosted by two hitmen in the parking lot and bloodily dispatches them with the aid of a spoon and a cup of instant ramen. As we gradually piece together along with our forgetful hero Mike is a sleeper agent in a clandestine CIA program endowed with top-level martial-arts skills and an encyclopedic knowledge of weaponry. With the program long since abandoned a smarmy young Agency bureaucrat (Topher Grace) decides to target Mike for extermination leading his former trainer (Connie Britton) to go rogue to rescue him. The disconnect between Mikes molasses-paced cognitive processes and killing-machine reflexes makes for some clever comedy early on as his lower brain keeps getting him out of jams his higher brain got him into. And the interplay between Eisenberg and Stewart is effortlessly charming with Stewart adding some welcome kinks and quirks to what could have been a thankless girlfriend role. But as the film nears its midway point very few of its promising ideas are carried through and it devolves into an average midrange actioner that just happens to feature an unlikely hero at the center. (Imagine a latter-day Van Damme outfitted with a Kurt Cobain wig and a ""what me worry?"" countenance and youre halfway there.) The films obvious antecedent ""Pineapple Express"" was thrilling because it committed equally to its Mutt-and-Jeff silliness and its genuinely brutal violence giving its innocents-in-danger premise a surprising amount of emotional weight. ""American Ultra"" on the other hand often plays like a live-action Roadrunner cartoon but without the sense of stylistic anarchy to pull it off. Grace in particular goes too over-the-top to be effectively detestable but not far enough to be a satisfying comic villain while Walton Goggins as a goonish agency asset drools and slobbers through his scenes as Mikes primary adversary. Nourizadeh helms a few of the action sequences with some panache particularly a late brawl in a grocery store but he never manages to pin down a consistent tone mashing up a variety of cinematic styles without ever nailing any of them. Only at the end with completely off-the-wall animated closing credits that embrace the films latent surreality do we finally get a glimpse of what ""American Ultra"" has been aching to become.

TWITTER Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart star as stoners pitted against the CIA in Nima Nourizadehs late-summer action comedy. Stoners take a bloodbath in American Ultra a genre mash thats mildly amusing until it cant think of anything else to do besides flop around in the deep end of conspicuous gore. Taking a vacation from more serious projects by playing a couple of lethargic ambition-free tokers who suddenly find themselves in the middle of a Joe Carnahan movie Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart smoke and say ""like"" and the F-word a lot and eventually kick plenty of butt in a way that looks to cook up a couple of weeks of buzzy late-summer business with good-times-seeking young audiences. Those who saw Nima Nourizadehs moderately successful first feature the horny-boys gross-out comedy Project X will have an idea of the excess to expect here although the commercial- and music video-trained director has thankfully moderated his shaky-cam tendencies this time around. All the same the script by Max Landis (Chronicle) uses an elaborate wind-up to throw a giant splatterball that delivers more of a big mess than anything coherent or genuinely engaging. Still sensation is sensation and there are enough amusingly dopey discussions nutty characterizations and creatively spiced servings of violence to service viewers who will probably prefer to see this in the heady state favored by the lead couple who shack up in Nowheresville West Virginia where no-account Mike (Eisenberg) dreams of creating a graphic novel while working the night shift at a bottom-feeder convenience store. Its a toss-up which is more far-fetched -- that a young woman who looks like Stewart sticks with this loser no matter what or that Mike (unbeknownst to him) is actually a CIA-trained sleeper agent who will suddenly emerge from his slumber as a slacker James Bond. But were obliged to buy into both propositions. The small-town sluggard stuff of the first 20 minutes or so is genial enough and provokes a few laughs by identifying multiple symptom of generational haplessness; itll be the comedy of recognition for more than a few in the audience. But the film lurches from first to fourth gear when overreaching CIA agent Adrian Yates (Topher Grace) decides its time to terminate the useless Mike from the Ultra program an actual agency initiative from the 1950s designed to reprogram select candidates to become superspies and assassins. Read more Kristen Stewart on Sexuality ""Google Me Im Not Hiding"" Yates sends a couple of goons up to hicktown to take Mike out but Mikes newly awakened powers get the better of them. He and Stewarts Phoebe soon benefit from the partisanship of Yates older underling Victoria (Connie Britton) which evolves into something like Mad magazines ""Spy vs. Spy"" cartoons except that theyre supposed to be working for the same side. The intermittently wacky instantly forgettable high jinks leave room for some enthusiastically over-the-top supporting turns by energetic character actors who give their all and then some. John Leguizamo as Mikes ghetto-mouthed local dealer and Walton Goggins as a laughing hyena of a hired killer all but literally bounce off the walls with their amusingly cranked-up antics while Britton manages to also let it rip when she finally arrives on the scene from D.C. Even with its tight running time American Ultra starts spinning its wheels well before the climax although its entirely possible that being in an altered state while watching this will keep the target audience giggling at the repetitive antics all the way to the end. As it is there are incidental pleasures to be had simply in observing the generally more serious-minded Eisenberg and Stewart slumming in a project thats dopey in more ways than one and not caring how unkempt slovenly and un-movie-starish they look and behave. The most creative and witty part of the entire film may well be the animated end credits which have a bracing panache mostly absent from whats come before.

But he has a beautiful girlfriend named Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) who loves him despite his dim prospects and even forgives him when a crippling panic attack prevents him from getting on an airplane bound for their dream vacation in Hawaii. Then one ordinary late-shift evening a wary-eyed woman in dark sunglasses and a trench coat (Connie Britton) walks up to the counter and repeats what sounds like military-code nonsense firmly at first and then desperately ""Chariot progressive. Listen. Mandelbrot set is in motion. Echo Choir has been breached we are fielding the ball."" Not long after that two nefarious-looking men show up in the parking lot outside--and Mike does something with the spoon intended for his Cup O Noodles dinner that he never knew he was capable of. What did those men want from him and where did he learn to turn soft-sided cutlery into a murder weapon?  Those mysteries have to take a backseat because there are more would-be assassins waiting in the wings and more pressing issues to address over the next few hours like not dying in a gasoline fireball or a ninja knife fight or a drone strike--and somewhere in the bloody middle of all that finding the perfect moment to propose to Phoebe. Not much else can be said about Ultra without ruining it a little bit aside from the fact that there are some highly entertaining cameos (Bill Pullman John Leguizamo Tony Hale Justifieds Walter Goggins) and that the storyline involves the kind of government conspiracy you usually find buried deep in Reddit subgroups. The script penned by Max Landis (Chronicle) is slick and shallow and almost cartoonishly violent and plot-wise its all basically a boondoggle. Still the movie is a fun mess and Eisenberg and Stewart who last costarred in the understated 2009 indie Adventureland make for unlikely but endearing (anti-)heroes; theyre Bonnie and Clyde with a water bong an extra-high body count and some kind of moral compass (albeit a spinning one) at the center. Topher Grace as bright-eyed as a Boy Scout proves once again that hes excellent at putting an aw-shucks face on sociopathy and the whole thing wraps in just over 90 wham-bam minutes. American Ultra probably wont win any awards that dont come from Spike TV or Soldier of Fortune but its August not Oscar season; check your brain at the popcorn-butter pump in the lobby and enjoy it.

Its violent brash inventive and horrific and perhaps the most romantic film of the year. Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart star as Mike and Phoebe two West Virginia stoners blissed out on weed and each other. ""Were the perfect fucked-up couple"" Mike beams before admitting that shes perfect and hes the fuck-up. As the movie starts Mike has scraped up the cash for a chintzy engagement ring so he can spend the rest of his life kinda ruining hers having panic attacks that prevent them from traveling forcing her to cook lest he burn down the house supporting them on his meager paycheck from the mini-mart. (Phoebe mans the phones for a bail bondsman -- convenient as Mike is continually arrested for possession.)With other actors this could play like slapstick. Swap out Eisenberg for Ashton Kutcher and American Ultra would become a flat comedy. But Eisenberg mines Mike for pathos -- hes not a punch line hes a flake who knows hes his own worst enemy. Theres a Mike in every town a smart guy who cant stop screwing up. Early on Mike tokes while gazing at an automobile wreck. It hits him Lively pink-haired Phoebe is the car and hes the tree thats stopped her dead. You expect Eisenberg the brittle brainiac to deliver the line like an insecure quip. Instead he begins to cry.Film DetailsCritics Pick American Ultra RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time96 min. More Info Trailer Yet its Stewart who makes this loony love story work. She takes what could easily be a simple supportive-girlfriend role -- a cheerleader/enabler -- and fills Phoebe with a rainbow of emotions. Stewarts Phoebe looks at Mike like she sees exactly who he is and picks him anyway. She knows how much of their future is on her shoulders. As the hostile local sheriff chides ""Youre his girlfriend youre his mom youre his maid youre his landlady."" True but shes still no pushover. When she unpacks their suitcase from another failed vacation (Mike vomited at the airport) Stewart silently channels Phoebes sadness and then with a small smile shows her forgiveness.The big twist is none of us know exactly who Mike is -- not even Mike. One night outside the Cash amp; Carry Mike looks up at the stars and this disheveled domestic drama turns into a thriller. The camera zooms up to a satellite and then beams to CIA headquarters where a garbled caller informs Agent Lasseter (Connie Britton) that Mike will be murdered within 24 hours. Agent Yates (Topher Grace) a vile twerp commanded the execution and shipped 20 killers to West Virginia including a repellent hick named Laugher (Walton Goggins) whose exhalations through his missing teeth sound like a ghost whistling across a grave.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Its no shock to moviegoers that Mike has been programmed with surprise skills though it is to him. ""I could list like 50 types of tanks right now"" he exclaims after Lasseter activates him so he can try to stay alive. Weve seen that plot point in a dozen dumb movies. What is shocking is how smart American Ultra is at being dumb -- its emotional intelligence is off the charts. Max Landis script isnt the usual whiz-bang wish fulfillment that assures us even losers can be special. Its a real romance about two people trying to survive and Eisenberg captures the horror of suddenly realizing your life has been a lie. ""What if Im a robot?"" he bleats. Once again its up to Phoebe to steady her fragile man -- and the movie around him. ""Youre not a robot"" she insists. Would a robot wail after stabbing a man with a spoon? Would it decide it would rather stop fighting crawl into bed with a bong and die smiling?What happens to Mike and Phoebe is hard to watch. Nourizadeh keeps the effects of violence painfully real As the blood bruises and busted lips rack up we look at the lovebirds and wince. But Nourizadeh is a sadist with a sense of humor. His fatal weapons include dustpans skillets frozen hamburgers and cans of tomatoes. Hes an ingenious director of action. No matter how crazy the brawl we know the geometry of the scene and we can follow Mikes intentions with an eye-flick.Better still Nourizadeh is ruthless with the audiences empathy. Villains have moments of heart; good people wind up on the wrong end of a gun. And hes got the control to both hold a camera still when fists are flying and whip us into frenzies with a wild montage ripping through Mike and Phoebes relationship at light-speed without skimming past its soul.American Ultra is astonishingly alive. It feels at once young and angry unhinged and sincere like a teenager scribbling ""Screw you"" to everyone but his first crush. Its laced with jokes but aimed deeper into our guts. Any movie could shoot a scene of Jesse Eisenberg emerging from a cloud of smoke in a bloody Hawaiian shirt for laughs. Only this movie could do it to make you cry.

Artless and unpleasant this is the kind of late-summer swill that gives August a bad name. Directed by Nima Nourizadeh (Project X) the film stars Jesse Eisenberg as Mike a rural Virginia convenience-store attendant with stringy hair and a weed habit. The one good thing in his otherwise meaningless existence is his endlessly patient girlfriend Phoebe (Kristen Stewart) whose unconditional love for Mike is as inexplicable to him as it is to us. If not for a needless prologue promising us that some people will eventually explode the films first few minutes could be mistaken for a generic Sundance drama. No such luck By the time Mike is ""activated"" killing two beefy dudes with a spoon and becoming the target of a CIA manhunt led by Topher Graces trite government stooge the film has already exhausted its slight charms. You best enjoy the idea of a scrawny underachiever learning that hes a physiologically enhanced super soldier because its the only one the movie has. Any other appeal here feels like the residue from the tenderness Stewart and Eisenberg cultivated in 2009s superior Adventureland. Their relationship here feels lived-in and loving but bruised. Still Max Landiss immature script seldom gives them interesting things to say to each other and the movie suffers enormously when theyre separated for long portions of it. Mike is too thinly sketched to carry the film by himself and the coterie of one-note supporting characters that ride to his rescue (i.e. John Leguizamo as a crazed drug dealer) only serve to remind you of all the fun youre not having. American Ultra is ultimately as satisfying as smoking oregano.

What these talented folks must not have seen coming however is how director Nima Nourizadeh (""Project X"") and screenwriter Max Landis (""Chronicle"") lose their way allowing the films sensibility to degenerate from outrageous to cartoony and piling up plot contrivances and corpses in stacks so high that they obscure whatever charms the film once might have held. ""American Ultra"" requires so many leaps in logic and tone that the audience winds up with charley horses. Also Read Kristen Stewart Doesnt Think Its Necessary to Figure Out If Youre Gay or Straight Eisenberg stars as Mike a West Virginia stoner with a humdrum job at an all-night grocery store. Hes a screw-up who wants only to do right by his devoted girlfriend Phoebe (Stewart) even though he torpedoes their trip to Hawaii (where he plans to propose) by getting violently ill at the airport. Hes conditioned to get sick anytime he tries to leave town as it turns out because hes not just a stoner Hes actually a CIA sleeper agent from an abandoned program run by Victoria (Britton). She learns that pencil-pushing brown-noser Adrian (Grace) plans to kill off all the subjects of that program so Victoria rushes to Mikes store and says a random series of words that at first seem like gibberish. As it turns out she has activated his killer abilities when Adrians men come to town to dispatch Mike he suddenly becomes a homicidal ninja dispatching the assassins with nothing more than a cup of ramen and a spoon. Thus begins an escalating chase as Adrian quarantines the town -- claiming Mike and Victoria are animal activists who have a deadly monkey fever -- with more and more government agents pouring in including Laugher (Goggins) one of several killers who are mental patients who have been turned into enhanced rogue operatives. Also Read Kristen Stewart Makes Jesse Eisenberg Uncomfortable in Awkward Interview (Video) If you think Eisenberg makes an unlikely small-town slacker hes an even more unlikely CIA super-agent but somehow the two miscastings cancel each other out and make him totally believable. He and Stewart have a sweet rapport but her character has to endure more twists and revelations than her performance can bear. (And if youre rolling your eyes at the idea of the ""Twilight"" star giving a performance you havent been paying attention to her most recent work. Go stream ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" if you havent seen it already.) The other actors do what they can with what theyve got but its a little dispiriting watching Leguizamo get saddled with this lazy caricature of a drug dealer -- in his early one-man shows this is the kind of role he used to joke about always being sent to audition for. Also Read Kristen Stewart Blurts Out Inappropriate Words With Jimmy Fallon (Video) Nourizadeh and Landis are clearly going for a Tarantino level of blood-soaked dark humor and while their cast is game the films bursts of violence grow tiresome as its plot gets more and more ludicrous and hard to swallow. Cinematographer Michael Bonvillain (""Zombieland"") applies a nighttime sheen to otherwise forgettable locations (a big-box store a military tent city a ramshackle house) but whatever charm the movie possesses early on has worn out well before the final shootout. If ""American Ultra"" is remembered at all in years to come it will be as a classic example of a late-August burn-off a high-concept movie with marketable names that nonetheless gets shoved into theaters late in the summer before reviews and bad word-of-mouth quietly send it off into oblivion.
