As in Meet The Parents its a comedy of awkward introductions here between the respective parents of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) in preparation for their nuptials. Hapless Greg of course is wedged in the middle poised for humiliation.The Fockers (snigger) are just the kind of loved-up liberals Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) despises. In an inspired move theyre played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand hes the tactile chatty stay-at-home dad shes the lusty hippy sex therapist. Both imbue their characters with warmth and credibility as well as humour though the last remains formulaic. As in American Pie comic set-pieces begin with small mishaps and build into deeply embarrassing scenarios a dog flushed down a toilet or mother Focker riding uptight Jack during over-enthusiastic massage.The message naturally is that Jack needs to loosen up but while his wifes emotional journey is plausible his is not. Though a necessary comic foil hes the least convincing character at best a stereotype at worst a vehicle for visual gags that dont fit (would the macho Jack of the first film really don fake breasts to feed milk to his grandson?). Most jokes however are as funny as theyre squirmily predictable making the film reliable genre fare. While it doesnt stretch itself the familiar humour and likeable performances should have fans at least welcoming the Fockers with open arms.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Robert De Niro Barbra Streisand Dustin Hoffman or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- Unlike movies involving razor-toothed monsters in outer space or adorable hobbits searching for magical rings comedies -- romantic or otherwise -- usually dont make great sequels. Laughter is often based on the unexpected and when you try to return to a comedic premise the second time around its very hard to maintain that feeling of the unknown.Put another way ""Dying is easy comedy is hard.""""Meet the Fockers"" the sequel to the highly successful ""Meet the Parents"" is a case in point. Not that it doesnt have its moments -- it does and you will find yourself laughing out loud here and there. But the freshness of the original is lacking.You cant argue with the talent involved. Ben Stiller is back as the overly earnest Gaylord ""Greg"" Focker with both Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner once again playing Jack and Dina Byrnes his in-laws to be. Teri Polo is back in place as his fiancee Pam. Then add Barbra Streisand -- in her first big-screen appearance in eight years -- and Dustin Hoffman as Gaylords parents Bernie and Roz Focker and you have enough megawatt star power to light up the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.Also back on board are director Jay Roach and screenwriters Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg.Both films are based on an old and sturdy premise Meeting the future in-laws and/or introducing those in-laws to each other for the first time a concept full of comedic potential. The last movie also got a lot of mileage out of Gaylords last name and its resemblance to a word unmentionable in CNN.com movie reviews.For those who missed the original the Byrnes are a conservative couple from tony Oyster Bay Long Island and their daughter Pam is the apple of their eye. De Niros Jack a former CIA operative is a stern and highly suspicious patriarch. His wife is a stay-at-home mom whose life revolves around her family.And then theres their daughters fiance Gaylord a Jewish man -- who is a nurse and not a doctor -- trying to instill himself into this tight WASP-y family.Now its time to introduce Gaylords family to the Byrnes. His mother and father are -- of course -- polar opposites to the upper-class Byrnes clan. Bernie Focker is a stay-at-home hippie-dippy guy; Roz Focker is a free-wheeling sex therapist to senior citizens.And its here where the movie starts to smell familiar. Families clash in ""Meet the Fockers"" starring (L-R) Blythe Danner Ben Stiller Dustin Hoffman Barbra Streisand Teri Polo and Robert De Niro.""Meet the Fockers"" contains the exact same comedic beats that were at the heart of ""Meet the Parents."" There are plenty of jokes based on the name Focker; there is an amusing dinner scene (once again involving a human body part); there is an embarrassing family sporting event -- this time touch football rather than water volleyball -- and there is plenty of high-tech spying by Jack using his CIA connections.Once again Gaylord makes every mistake in the book trying to please everyone. Once again every attempt blows up in his face. Even Jinx the cat is back. This time he makes mincemeat out of the Fockers dog Moses.Every joke has an obvious set-up and you can see them coming a mile away. However the talents involved -- and they are formidable -- do manage to induce a chuckle or two.This is the first time Hoffman and Streisand have worked together. They make a wonderful team but its too bad the material isnt fresher and more worth their time and yours.""Meet the Fockers"" isnt a horrible movie. Its just not particularly great and whether you leave your comfortable couch to check out this film all depends on just how much you like the actors involved and just how far youre willing to go for a few mild laughs.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

Nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and his fiancee Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) decide its time for both sets of in-laws to meet. Cue a blockheaded comedy of opposition in which Pams right-wing WASPish parents Jack (Robert De Niro) and Dina Byrnes (Blythe Danner) drive to Florida to meet Gregs father (Dustin Hoffman) and mother (Barbra Streisand). Oh those sexually uptight conservatives Oh those nutty huggy Jewish liberals (Streisands character is a sex therapist who teaches seniors to discover their inner kama sutra batteries.) The movie basically consists of every character difference the hack scriptwriters could squeeze out of their trivial minds. And theres a ridiculous subplot in which Gregs virginity-breaking history with a former Spanish maid is brought to embarrassing light.

"Meet the Fockers | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; meet-the-fockers ) Meet the Fockers (United States 2004) A movie review by James Berardinelli I am not a fan of Meet the Parents the 2000 film that introduced Ben Stiller to the joys of having an ex-CIA agent as a potential father-in-law. The movie is too much like a sit-com although as a counterbalance it offers several big laughs. Meet the Fockers the 2004 follow-up plays much like the original but with less effective humor. In the nearly two-hour running length there are maybe five or six solid chuckles resulting in a movie experience that is more tedious than entertaining. The problem lies in the screenplay (credited to John Hamburg and Jim Herzfeld who also wrote installment 1) which latches on to the few clever and/or funny elements in the film and runs them into the ground via repetition. Take the name of the Ben Stiller character Gaylord Focker. Hearing him called ""Gay Focker"" was an amusing moment in Meet the Parents but the gag works only once. That doesnt stop the filmmakers from overloading us with new Focker references and names. For example Meet the Fockers mentions cousins Randy Focker and Orney Focker. If you laugh out loud reading those names head for the theater. This is the kind of comedy that Meet the Fockers delivers. It doesnt miss an obvious telegraphed joke but never comes up with an instance of humor that isnt contrived plotted or stale. The film starts a short time after the events related in Meet the Parents. Gaylord (a.k.a. Greg) is now in the ""circle of trust"" comprised by his fiancA(c)e Pam (Teri Polo) and her parents Jack and Dina Byrnes (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner). With the wedding approaching and Pam acknowledging a bun in the oven its time for conservatives Jack and Dina to meet Gregs aging hippie parents Bernie and Roz Focker (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand). Of course theyre oil and water but instead of sparks flying they sputter. Eventually Dina comes around to Bernie and Rozs way of thinking but Jack smells a cover-up and decides to get the truth using a little Sodium Pentathol. Its never clear in a film like Meet the Fockers whether were supposed to care about any of the characters. On one hand there are moments of flat melodrama that indicate the filmmakers believe theres some value to a happy ending. On the other hand most of the feeble attempts at humor are made at the expense of the characters - most notably Ben Stillers Greg. Stiller of course has become known as a human punching bag. His entire purpose for appearing in a movie is to either embarrass himself be embarrassed by others or some combination of both. Usually its at least moderately funny. In Meet the Fockers its not. About four years ago it was amusing to see Robert De Niro lampoon his tough-guy image. Now however that seems to be all he does. While theres nothing dishonorable about appearing in comedies De Niro only plays one type of character in these throw-away films and its starting to wear thin. Having gone so deep into self-parody one wonders whether De Niro is capable of coming back and giving a powerhouse dramatic performance or whether audiences would buy him in such a role. Teenagers watching the ""You talkin to me?"" clip from Taxi Driver break into laughter; they think De Niro is being funny. It was an admittedly guilty pleasure to see Dustin Hoffman act like an idiot in the Huckabees movie but we dont need a repeat performance here. And the biggest joke surrounding Barbra Streisand is that she signed to play Mother Focker. Her portrayal of sex therapist Roz is nothing special (although I did note that the camera shows her face from all sides apparently dispelling the rumor that she only allows herself to be shot from one angle). Teri Polo returns from the first movie looking attractive but having almost no screen presence. (In an effort to either raise her profile or earn some cash she has apparently agreed to do a Playboy spread.) Perhaps the funniest moment in the film occurs when a toddler utters ""assa|hole"" as his first word. Its crude but at least (as presented) its funny. Thats more than can be said for the little dog humping everything in sight or Streisand kneeling atop De Niro giving him a massage. If theres one thing thats disappointing about Meet the Fockers its that there seems to be the potential for a laughter-generating material but its never explored. There are few things sadder than wasted potential unless its sitting through 115 minutes of mediocrity desperately searching for a few decent jokes.

"Loco Parentis washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Loco Parentis Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday December 22 2004 The saddest moment in any American film this year is a scene where Robert De Niro Blythe Danner Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand sit at a table. These are phenomenally talented people whove made substantial contributions over the years to the pleasure and edification of audiences in all realms. Why arent they in a Tennessee Williams play? Why arent they in a revival of Noel Cowards ""Private Lives""? Why isnt Steven Spielberg directing them; why didnt Robert Towne write their lines? And most tragic of all Why are they in something called ""Meet the Fockers""? Dont get me wrong. ""Meet the Fockers"" isnt a disgrace a travesty an abomination. But its nothing that merits the spectacular talents of its cast and given the intermittence of its humor and its reliance on bad puns and gross physical comedy it would have worked just as well with television-scale stars ""Meet the Fockers"" starring Ted Danson Shelley Long Tony Danza and Pam Dawber. Just as good and what a comeback vehicle for Dawber as the wacky Roz Oh well. The movie thats up there does offer something I never thought Id see Barbra Streisand playing touch football. As viewers of the predecessor film ""Meet the Parents"" also directed by Jay Roach and also starring De Niro and Danner and of course Ben Stiller already know the story is designed as an ordeal by older generation. In the first one poor Greg Focker (Stiller) a male nurse was living with engaged to and hopelessly in love with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). But in order to marry her he had to pass muster with her family mainly her dad Jack (De Niro) an obsessive control-freak ex-CIA officer. De Niros macho blusterings played against Stillers diffidence to great comic effect and box office. This variant simply widens the concept. It contrives to take the Byrnes family with Stillers Greg to Florida to meet Gregs parents Hoffman and Streisand. It explores similar comic contrasts juxtaposing the already established rigidity of De Niros Jack against the hippie-dippie loosey-goosey casualness of the senior Fockers. Its really good to see Streisand just having fun. She always had deft comic timing and an ability to send herself up and as earthy Roz a sex therapist for the elderly shes one of the best things in the film. I wish I could say the same for Hoffman but as Bernie a former lawyer who years ago became a househusband he seems to me to be slightly discordant with the others. Though the character calls for relaxation underneath his performance theres a manic edge and since De Niro also has a manic edge the contrast between them doesnt quite work tipping the movie endlessly toward shrillness. Danner the lesser light isnt given enough to do and thats a shame. As for Stiller hes quite good. His shtick is his seeming rationality in the face of the escalating weirdness. He tries to remain calm nonconfrontational logical even reasonable as either crazed Jack or smarmy Bernie goes off on one weird tangent or another. Polo hardly registers. But still . . . better writers better director some mad genius some daring and this movie might have been a contender instead of a negligible product content to stoop for the easy laughs and the easy money. We get endless riffs on the suggestiveness of the name ""Focker"" yet more jokes on a pampered cat that has been trained to flush the toilet a little dog that has a libido the size of all outdoors. Theres a random baby in the group lamely justified as the son of a Byrnes child currently out of the country and although the kid (played by twins Spencer and Bradley Pickren) is adorable hes really there only to set up one mildly comic sequence. Lots of things dont work. The Fockers insistence on humiliating their son before his soon-to-be parents-in-law goes on too long and becomes excruciating though the circumcision product in the fondue was a funny gag. Jack Byrness over-engineered recreational vehicle not funny. Not even a little. Then theres a potential comic blockbuster of a scene in which Greg injected with truth serum by the nasty Jack bumbles to the stage at an engagement party and speaks nothing but the truth. Again its slightly funny but the potential here like the potential of the film is never approached. The whole sequence is anticlimactic. In ""Meet the Fockers"" the cast is too good for the script and the script is too good for the director and the director is too good for the horny dog jokes. Meet the Fockers (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for crude sexual humor and drug references.

Their public displays of affection in Meet the Fockers (  1/2 out of four) cause poor Gaylord (Ben Stiller) no end of humiliation. His father insists on calling him Gay when hes known to everyone else as Greg. He even has cousins with names such as Randy Orny and Dom. Barbra Streisands Roz Focker puts the hurt on Jack Byrnes (Robert De Niro) in Meet the Fockers. Universal Studios Clearly the filmmakers are milking that treacherous surname (it rhymes with hawkers) for all its worth. The conceit to this sequel to the 2000 hit Meet the Parents is the meeting of two dissimilar worlds The patrician uptight Byrneses (Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner) parents of Gregs fiancee (Teri Polo) face off against the free-spirited and passionate Bernie and Roz Focker (Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand). Bernie is a warm-hearted eccentric with no sense of boundaries (played perfectly by Hoffman) and Jack (De Niro) is a controlling former CIA agent with nothing but boundaries. Obviously clashes ensue. De Niros deadpan overbearing style again works like a charm. Stiller as the comic foil has some funny moments as well though perhaps not as many as in the first movie. The dignified Danner lightens up well but Streisand is a bit blah especially since this is her big screen comeback. (Her last movie was 1996s The Mirror Has Two Faces.) Roz is a sex therapist who loves to talk shop. Being Rozs son is something like being the offspring of a nurturing frizzy-haired Alfred Kinsey. At dinner Roz and Bernie discuss their relief when Greg lost his virginity at 19 and proceed to provide too many pertinent details. Greg and the Byrneses are under constant scrutiny for any sexual problems which Roz is confident she can fix. Meanwhile she and Bernie are very open about their still-potent attraction and dont care if their let-it-all-hang-out attitude makes others uncomfortable. So much is made of this one-note joke that eventually you want to yell ""Enough already I get it Next gag please."" But there are some real laughs in Meet the Fockers. Jacks grandson Little Jack (Spencer and Bradley Pickren) nearly steals the show. The child speaks his first word while at the Fockers home in Florida. The word he chooses to proudly proclaim is too naughty to print but its hilarious to hear it uttered in an infantile voice no matter how computer enhanced. Hoffman and Streisand have chemistry together but the conflict between De Niro and Stiller is still the movies central theme and the biggest laugh-getter. Unfortunately supporting character Alanna Ubach who plays the Fockers Cuban former nanny is a fairly insulting Latina caricature coming off like a brunette Charo with an exaggerated accent and hoochy-koochy affectations. Sure the film is hinged on extreme portrayals and ridiculous scenarios but it should avoid offensive stereotypes. For mass audiences Meet the Fockers may be a welcome antidote to the crop of serious awards-caliber movies released during December. Its a silly good time and thats something these days.

Ran on ... more Photo Credit Tracy Bennett Thats nothing -- you should see my parents 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Meet the Fockers Comedy. Starring Robert De Niro Ben Stiller Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. Directed Jay Roach. (PG-13 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The story of ""Meet the Parents"" didnt call for a sequel but the success of it certainly did. And so we get ""Meet the Fockers"" an amusing-enough comedy in which our hero Gaylord Focker (Ben Stiller) must now endure the agony of watching his stiff future in-laws meet his bohemian parents. For audiences that loved ""Meet the Parents"" the movie is a welcome chance to revisit funny and familiar characters. But the picture doesnt come close to approaching the near-classic quality of the earlier film. The revelation of ""Meet the Fockers"" is Barbra Streisand who plays Gaylords sex-therapist mom. Streisand an Oscar winner has been making movies since the 1960s and one could argue that shes slumming by appearing in this light comedy. But she has never been better. The shtick and schmaltz that have often characterized her comic and dramatic acting respectively are gone. In its place is a new relaxation a kind of warm womanly wisdom that allows her ease and fluidity. Shes never been funnier. Shes never been more attractive. One gets the feeling she could step into a great role tomorrow and do the best work of her career. The comedy of ""Meet the Parents"" turned on Gaylords discomfort at meeting his father-in-law (Robert De Niro) Jack a stern and extremely paranoid ex-CIA agent. Most of the comedy in ""Meet the Fockers"" turns on the discomfort that Jack experiences when he comes up against Bernie and Roz Focker who are his temperamental and philosophical opposites idealistic open compulsively self-revealing highly sexed and genuinely delighted with their lives. When Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) meets Jack he throws his arms around him even though Jack is about the least huggable man imaginable. Related Stories Fockers is lightweight fun The advertising for ""Meet the Fockers"" suggested a story in which Gaylords oblivious parents much to their sons mortification make fools of themselves with Jack. But the movie comes up with something more interesting. The Fockers are not at all oblivious. They may be given to eccentric utterances -- ""Can you believe I conceived him with one testicle?"" asks Bernie -- but they know whats going on and they get Jacks number from the word go. Its Jack who must try to fit in and be agreeable. Its a nice switch. The only problem with this as a comic strategy is that it can only work for so long. In ""Meet the Parents"" Gaylord knew he had to please Jack because he wanted to marry Jacks daughter. So the filmmakers were able to structure the movie as a series of ever-escalating embarrassments. By contrast theres a real limit to how far Jack will go to please Bernie and Roz even if he is a guest in their home. Theres less at stake for him and so the movie has to go fishing for laughs in several directions at once. The laughs are located but the strain is unmistakable. In fact until the Fockers show up after about 15 minutes ""Meet the Fockers"" is floundering. The arrival of Hoffman and Streisand brings a gust of energy and the movie stays buoyed mainly by lurching from one clever comic bit to another colorful character turn including some surprisingly effective bits involving De Niro and a baby. Thats good news in a way. The bad news is that the movie needs to be buoyed at all that theres little inherent in the comic set-up thats intrinsically interesting. Still laugh for laugh the movie delivers and theres pleasure to be had in watching these pros in action. -- Advisory This film contains sex talk.

A crafty cat manages to flush a rat-sized dog down the toilet of an RV in ""Meet the Fockers"" a gag that literally sums up the pervasive below-the-belt humor in this fitfully funny but always crude sequel to the much more amusing ""Meet the Parents."" The gap between the first and second installments isnt as gaping as with for instance ""Analyze This"" and ""Analyze That"" but the laughs ""Fockers"" generates are the type you feel embarrassed about almost immediately afterward. Nonetheless major star power lack of alternative strong comedies in the holiday marketplace and fond memories of the original which raked in 330 million worldwide (half of it overseas) assure strong returns for this Universal/DreamWorks hookup. Far more than the 2000 original which was mostly implicit in its ethnic implications ""Fockers"" is explicit about touchy-feely liberal and liberated Jews trying to mellow out uptight conservative and repressed WASPs (this is such a shopworn notion by now that a much more novel comedy could be wrung out of the reverse dynamic). When its attention is not fixated in the general vicinity of the groin which is seldom pic trades on the tireless efforts of the ceaselessly horny Fockers played by the boundlessly enthusiastic Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand to remove the figurative broom from the posterior of their sons future in-laws a former CIA op and proper old-school wife portrayed by Robert De Niro and Blythe Danner. Tenor of the humor closely matches the most vulgar moments of Jay Roachs third and presumably final ""Austin Powers"" entry; its curious in fact how both Roach franchises have declined in virtually identical ways only this time in one step rather than two. When the engaged Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo) arrive on Long Island to join Pams parents for a journey to Florida to finally meet Gregs folks the Byrnes -- Jack (De Niro) and Dina (Danner) -- surprise them with the announcement that theyll be driving down to Florida in Jacks giant new RV partly to accommodate his grandson Little Jack for whom hes caring. Once the group arrives at the paradisiacal Focker Isle the comic culture clash starts in earnest. Like rich leftover hippies without a care in the world Bernie and Roz Focker (Hoffman and Streisand) live in a dreamy breezy house where Roz conducts sex-for-seniors exercise classes. Natch everyone tries to be on their best behavior at the outset but Bernies instantly familiar physicality and uncensored ways immediately set Jacks jaw on edge confirming Gregs worst fears about whats in store. Returning screenwriters Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg clearly spent most of their time engineering bumps in the road that would provide an abundance of embarrassment awkwardness and conflict. For starters a hot Latin lady (Alanna Ubach) formerly the Fockers maid is presented as the woman to whom the teenage Greg lost his virginity with a possible illegitimate son the result. None too pleased about this Pam informs Greg that shes pregnant a fact that must be kept from Jack at all costs -- an unlikely proposition given the Fockers utter inability to keep their mouths shut on any subject. Then theres the matter of Little Jack (played by beautiful blond twins Spencer and Bradley Pickren) whos too young to talk but whom the strict and militaristic Jack is treating like a little man. One lowball comic highlight is Gregs brief baby-sitting stint which he hopes will convince Jack hes fit to be a father. When all else fails however which is not infrequently Roach falls back on the age-old adage ""Cut to the kid."" Still its the relative oldsters who get the lions share of the action here with Stiller and Polo overpowered in terms of star wattage and opportunities mostly relegated to second banana status. De Niros clenched suspicious traditionalist was fresher the first time around but his slow-burn barely contained reactions to the many things that irritate him still yield some genuine amusement. Hoffman however provides the film with its greatest energy source. Even more than in the recent ""I Heart Huckabees"" thesp gives the impression of being in a second adolescence so frisky mischievous and physically invigorated is his characterization. Almost continuously Hoffman pushes beyond the expected with comic provocation that gives pic an extra spark. Streisand doesnt go that far but is a pleasure to watch in circumstances that make her appear more relaxed onscreen than she has in the more than 30 years since ""Whats Up Doc?"" Although potent B.O. for ""Fockers"" may create corporate desire for a third installment the extent to which the creative fertility level has dropped between entries one and two provides a significant argument for Roach amp; Co. to retire the Fockers before its really too late.
