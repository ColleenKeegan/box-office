Now this reboot of Sam Raimis landmark 1981 horror exhumes its disembowelled corpse. Yet despite much old-school splatter its seldom frightening and oddly unfunny. The only hint of the originals cartoonish sado-slapstick lies in sly glimpses of the implements (nail-gun chainsaw) that will later pierce puncture and tear flesh and bone. Of the friends who meet up in a forest cabin first to be possessed is heroin-addicted Mia (Jane Levy) who transforms into a demon. Caught up in a maelstrom of gruesome horror her brother (Shiloh Fernandez) his girlfriend and two of Mias friends turn on each other as they battle to stay alive. Director Fede Alvarez avoids CGI and gleefully stages scenes of gore. The most grim moments are those of self-mutilation a tongue sliced in two and an arm severed with an electric carving knife.

A Good gore movie on its own. In Fact it shouldnt have had anything related to Evil Dead at all. Because thats where the film makes its biggest mistake. Seen the cabin so close to the original the book and ritual references feels great basement etc... and then seeing what could potentially become the next Ash Willians is very refreshing. A unlikely hero kinda of a coward reluctant to the idea of killing his possesed friends for a greater good then he comes to a point when he takes measures on his own hands and turns into an almost badass thats what Ash Willians was in the original movie but to me at least it felt like towards the end of the movie the script changes and while David was the one being possesed by the Ash Willians spirit it suddenly gets droped and the movies becomes all about Mia in the last few minutes and damn it falls pretty hard. In my oppinion at least the whole fun of Evil Dead is seeing Ash grow from coward to the cult hero we all love and the new Evil Dead starts doing exactly that this time to David and suddenly he gets droped. It failed because it drops what could have been the one potential fun character to look at being the hero of the new movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 19 2013gregFeaturedI loved it.

Just a gorefest.. which in itself still couldnt carry the weight of the movie. The plot was very uneven and incoherent. If that girl out in the woods was the demon why did 4 more souls need to be consumed to release the abomination. That hippy professor already released it by reading the words. How does getting jumpstarted like a car make Mia look all fresh and good as new? When Mia says youre all going to die tonight it sounds like a bored girl running into a voice disguiser at the Dollar Store. Theres a lot of little things like this that annoy me throughout the movie but Im still glad that people liked it because it keeps the Evil Dead name alive even though they expend a lot of energy hating on the haters.

By David Edelstein Sam Raimi who directed the original co-produced this remake. 10 Shares Share 8 Tweet 2 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo TriStar Heres the bleeding obvious All humans are greedy Hollywood humans greedier and nowadays no one gives a second thought to the notion of cannibalizing an old property in the hope of creating a new ""franchise."" (I refuse to use that word without quotation marks -- it should be reserved for Burger Kings and 7-11s not films.) You can remake a movie but you cant bring back the era in which it was made and seen. Say what you will about Jonathan Demmes The Manchurian Candidate it had an urgency that came from anger and despair over the Iraq War. It wasnt the same damn thing with new technology. Which brings me to the 1981 The Evil Dead now remade as Evil Dead -- no definite article and not much definition in other ways. First the old one The magic of Sam Raimis The Evil Dead had everything to do with its time place and resources. It was the ne plus ultra of the late-seventies/early-eighties splatter films -- only handmade kicky exuberant where others of its ilk were plodding. Its technique wasnt secondary -- it was the whole shebang. Raimi had a skeleton crew used friends as actors/victims and was forced by his micro-budget to invent his own moves (such as the Shakicam mounted on a board held by two runners). It was extravagantly icky -- but you could almost hear the director cackling with every tear in the flesh every nail slammed into an ankle. I went with a college pal to see it in Bostons then-scary Combat Zone because Id heard about it vaguely. (No Internet back then -- viruses moved slowly.) I was disappointed by the minimal story line but turned on by the vibe. I couldnt wait to see what Raimi would do next. Among other things he has co-produced this remake directed by Fede Alvarez. The good The actors are more professional -- although youll miss Bruce Campbell. The gore quotient is up through the roof to the moon. Its rousing in its way. Gasps moans general writhing -- and thats just the audience. Theres a new prologue that comes on like torture porn and takes a switchback turn nice. I liked how you dont know wholl be the so-called ""Final Girl"" to face off against the demon. The cleverest touch is the reason for four friends to go to that cabin in the woods in which they find the Book of Dead that opens the portal to the Big Ick. Mia (Jane Levy) the sister of the hitherto-reckless pretty boy David (Shiloh Fernandez) is a junkie who needs to kick and her friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas) Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Davids girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) are there to see she stays put. That means when Eric reads aloud from the damnable book and the demon rushes into Mia everyone thinks its just an unusually nasty withdrawal. This is a farcical device -- we know what they dont -- thats not just funny but in its way grimly resonant. Watching someone kick really is hell. Wholl live and become undead is rarely predictable and its fun to see the way the role of principal demon-fighter is passed like a scorching torch. But the passing of the torch from Raimi to Alvarez is not a momentous occasion. In the end who really cares? Five years from now will you want to watch this bloody 14 million extravaganza or Raimis shoestring original which was Amateur Hour elevated to pop art? Evil Dead just bleeds money.

But every Evil Dead family is evil and dead in its own way. Or something like that. In any case its an observation that to my surprise is supported by Evil Dead director Fede Alvarezs fresh yet faithful sequel/remake of Sam Raimis 1981 indie-horror classic The Evil Dead. Related Story The Greatest Horror Films of the Past Half-Century Alvarez is treading on sacred (which is to say accursed) ground here but he does so nimbly. Raimis familiar ingredients are all present the five early twentysomethings and the remote cabin; the infernal tome and demons-eye rush through the forest; the Dutch-angle camerawork and dark humor; the priapic foliage and living burial; the shotgun and the chainsaw; the slicings burnings dismemberments and other sundry castigations of the flesh. But all have been diligently reshuffled like playing cards in a chthonian game of Clue. (The girlfriend In the bathroom With a jagged shard of mirror)Alvarez opens with a creepy cunning prologue featuring a decidedly Whedonesque reversal before settling in for the main affair This time out the five victims-to-be are not out in the woods for recreation but rather to support the effort of one among them (Jane Levy from TVs Suburgatory) to kick her heroin habit. Its a sharp conceit--her friends are committed to forcing her to stay there in the cabin no matter what; her inevitable possession by forces unknown is initially mistaken for withdrawal--but Alvarez is wise enough not to carry it too far. Once the stabbings and the ""youre all going to die tonight""s and the unlicensed oral surgeries begin all questions of addiction are properly relegated to the back burner.If I havent yet made it clear Evil Dead is not a film for the faint of heart. The gore is considerable (though often imaginative) and Alvarezs decision to forego CGI effects pays grisly dividends. That may not be a genuine tongue being slashed in half lengthwise (while still it should be noted in its owners mouth) but damned if it doesnt look like one.I thought The Cabin in the Woods had exhausted the possibilities of the cabin-in-the-woods movie. But Alvarezs reboot demonstrates that theres still life--and more crucially death--in the subgenre.The young cast--which also features Shiloh Fernandez Lou Taylor Pucci Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore--fulfill their sanguinary obligations capably but they are ultimately and correctly puppets in Alvarezs gruesome Grand Guignol. The director himself who co-wrote the screenplay with Rodo Sayagues (and an uncredited polish by Diablo Cody) directs with a self-assurance that is all the more remarkable when one considers that his most prominent work before this--and the one that got him noticed by Raimi--was a five-minute short reportedly made for 300 in which giant robots destroy his native city of Montevideo Uruguay. I confess that I thought The Cabin in the Woods had exhausted the possibilities of the cabin-in-the-woods movie. Indeed Id thought that Evil Dead 2 Raimis own semi-parodic sequel had finished it off all the way back in 1987. But Alvarezs reboot demonstrates that theres still life--and more crucially death--to be found in the subgenre. Is it as good as Raimis groundbreaking original? Of course not. But it is a stylish and worthy homage inventive even as it is derivative never quite jokey but never taking itself too seriously and clocking in at an entirely appropriate 91 minutes. Any longer would be unmerciful; any shorter ungenerous.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

"Evil Dead directed by Fede Alvarez reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Evil Dead A Good Old-Fashioned B-movie Bloodbath Evil Dead A Good Old-Fashioned B-movie Bloodbath Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 5 2013 529 PM Evil Dead A good old-fashioned B-movie bloodbath. By Dana Stevens Lou Taylor Pucci as Eric in Evil Dead Courtesy of TriStar Pictures After youve watched Evil Dead come back and listen to Slates Spoiler Special Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I have a thing about hand trauma--many of my nightmares the really gnarly kind you have when you wake up too early and drop restlessly back to sleep again involve horrible things happening to my own or others hands. So Evil Dead Fede Alvarezs remake of the 1981 no-budget cult classic directed by Sam Raimi robustly carried out its mandate of turning my stomach In it characters hands are sawed off with electric carving knives shot full of nails from a nail gun infected with demonic viruses that cause their flesh to blister and boil and in the movies climactic girl-on-demon battle--no I wont tell you that last hand story not for fear of spoilers but because its just too freaking gross to revisit. Yet like many of the people surrounding me in the screening room--some of them decked out in Evil Dead cosplay outfits--I was also laughing out loud as I peered out from behind my own (thankfully unsevered) fingers at the ludicrous bodily harm inflicted on the movies characters five pretty young people stranded in a remote cabin in the classic setup familiar from countless movies including Raimis original (and parodied in last years slasher send-up The Cabin in the Woods). This new Evil Dead doesnt mix comedy and horror with quite the cheeky verve of the original but to be fair that would be a pretty tall order. Raimi and Bruce Campbell--the lantern-jawed star of the original Evil Dead and its follow-ups Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness--serve as co-producers and handpicked the director Alvarez a visual-effects specialist from Uruguay making his feature-film debut. The resulting 91-minute screamfest will appeal to young splatter fans unfamiliar with the series history while alienating only the most unforgivingly hardcore Raimi-heads. Advertisement This new Evil Dead makes two important changes to the five-kids-in-a-cabin template. First off it foregrounds the sibling relationship between two of the demon-bait youngsters David (Shiloh Fernandez) and Mia (Jane Levy) who have been semi-estranged since the recent death of their mentally ill mother. And second the script (by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues with an uncredited writing pass by Diablo Cody) makes Mia a heroin addict whose friends have spirited her off to this gloomy place in an attempt to shepherd her through the withdrawal phase of her recovery. Turning the demon-possession angle of the original into an allegory for addiction was a smart way to update the Evil Dead story--it not only grounds Mias struggles against Satan in a recognizable psychological reality it also gives the other characters an at least vaguely logical reason to stay in that dank spooky cabin (seriously this is not a well-appointed cabin) even after very bad things start to befall them. After all arent glazed eyes foaming at the mouth and shrieks alternating with guttural curses just par for the course from a junkie in withdrawal? The gang of friends even includes a registered nurse (Jessica Lucas) armed with hypodermic needles and powerful sedatives just in case Mia gets hard to handle. What could go wrong? Well for starters the vegetal rape. In one set piece lifted almost wholesale from the original as Mia attempts to escape through the woods shes attacked by a malevolent vine that after shooting out tendrils to shackle her at the wrists and ankles wends its horrifying way up her skirt. Though penetration is only implied not shown its nonetheless a tough scene to sit through--and one thats clearly meant to feel painful and disturbing not luridly ""sexy"" for the viewer. In general this Evil Dead (centered unlike the earlier trilogy around a female protagonist) feels curiously unsexist even at times weirdly feminist. Sure several attractive women (along with some cute if somewhat anemic guys) get maimed and dismembered before our eyes but this time sisters are doin it for (and sometimes to) themselves. Later possessed by the ancient demon/biological virus/ineffably evil whatsit that invaded Mias body in the woods another luckless protagonist will robotically slice off a chunk of her own face--only to have another character slip on the bit of errant flesh like a dropped banana peel. What kind of a sicko am I that I let out a simultaneous laugh-scream (that patented Sam Raimi crowd reaction) at the sheer hyperbolic gore of that whoops-I-stepped-on-a-cheek pratfall? (The same kind as everyone else in the audience I guess.) It was like a gag two sick-minded fifth-grade boys would come up with on a sleepover--whats the grossest thing you can imagine?--and laughing at it felt cathartic and funny and freeing. Though it never channels the raw DIY energy of the original Evil Dead series--what big-budget version could?--this polished clever remake remains true to the spirit of the original which was at once viscerally terrifying and weirdly lighthearted. If like me youre a viewer repelled by the sadistic ""torture porn"" trend in horror (Hostel Saw etc.) this romp might remind you of the cleansing properties that are still to be found in a good old-fashioned B-movie bloodbath. If youre someone who just plain doesnt like horror one of those people who feels like passing out at the sight of even clearly fake gore on-screen (no judgment here--I live with one) then youd better get out of the cabin and make a run for the car right now. Wait Ill get you the car keys. Let me just open this creaky trap door down to the basement ... Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Starring Jane Levy Shiloh Fernandez Jessica Lucas Lou Taylor Pucci Elizabeth Blackmore Director Fede Alvarez Running time 131 Release Opened Apr 5 2013  Editorial Review A fear fest with a little funBy Michael OSullivanFriday April 5 2013Fans of the 1981 ""The Evil Dead"" and its sequels can relax. And by ""relax"" I mean ""screw themselves up into tight little balls of nervously flinching muscle."" The reboot of the beloved if somewhat low-budget cult horror film about five young friends terrorized by a demonic spirit does exactly what its supposed to do scare you to the chiropractor. For those who are not fans ""scare"" will probably mean a trip to the drug store for Pepto-Bismol. The new version by Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez making his feature debut is more stomach-churning than soul-chilling. The list of on-screen atrocities includes attacks by nail gun electric carving knife chain saw shotgun crowbar and chunk of ceramic from a broken toilet tank used as a crude bludgeon. Hey when youre face to face with the bloodthirsty fiend who has inhabited the body of your best pal you grab whatever tools are available. As in the original film the action revolves around a derelict cabin in the woods. This time its the site of a drug intervention. One of the friends Mia (Jane Levy) is a junkie and her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) and Mias two best friends Eric and Olivia (Lou Taylor Pucci and Jessica Lucas) have decided that the best place for Mia to experience the seizures hallucinations and psychosis of withdrawal is in a place with a taxidermy shops worth of rotting cat carcasses hanging from the basement ceiling. In fairness our heroes dont find those right off the bat even though Mia can smell kitty tartare the minute she walks in the front door. It takes these dim bulbs a few minutes to find the feline abattoir just as it takes them a few minutes to unleash the devil to whom the cats apparently have been sacrificed. Eric does this by opening a book of occult incantations -- clearly marked in red ballpoint pen with the all-caps warning ""LEAVE THIS BOOK ALONE."" He then proceeds to read aloud the words that awaken Beelzebub. What follows is a rapid descent into madness homicide and self-mutilation first by one then another of the cohorts until it is literally raining blood. ""Evil Dead"" has its moments but many come courtesy of familiar horror-movie camera tricks the face in the medicine-cabinet mirror; the 360-degree shot (a.k.a. the spin-around scare); and the dreaded shadow that flits past so quickly you cant see it (a.k.a. the what-the-heck-was-that?). Other touches seem cadged from the canon of horror-movie cliches from the hand reaching up from the grave a la ""Carrie"" to the zombie neck twitch manifested by the actors as they are one by one possessed by evil. Wasnt that move already a bit stale by the time Michael Jacksons ""Thriller"" video came out? For Alvarez presumably its homage not theft. Even so the whole things kind of fun if your taste runs to gallows humor. Laughs leaven the often grisly proceedings. ""Youre hurting me"" whines Natalie after she has amputated one of her own arms and the second one has been blasted off with buckshot. Those wont be the last severed limbs youll see in ""Evil Dead"" a gore fest thats just effective enough to whet fans appetite for a sequel even as it kills everyone elses appetite for dinner.Contains obscenity and prolific grisly violence and gore.

Comments click to enlarge Evil Dead Video Rated R  91 minutes  2013 The cabin-in-the-woods setting of Sam Raimis cult classic The Evil Dead (1981) has been so widely copied that for this remake the screenwriters (among them Diablo Cody of Juno fame) have added a character wrinkle this time the young people are not vacationing but trying to help one of them (Jane Levy) kick heroin. Given all the mayhem that ensues this idea is quickly dropped but you have to give them credit for trying. As with most millennial remakes of post-Vietnam horror classics there isnt much to do here except turn the gore up to 11; if youve ever wondered what it would be like to jam a chainsaw into someones mouth (and who hasnt?) this will give you a good working idea. Fede Alvarez directed and Lou Taylor Pucci is pretty good as the hippie character who always gets it in these movies. By J.R.

Thats the message conveyed in Evil Dead ( out of four; rated R; opening Friday nationwide). Lets add a warning about reboots of dances with demons.The original Evil Dead one of director Sam Raimis earliest films had almost equal parts gore and comedy. For fans of the genre thats hitting it out of the park--especially since the 1981 horror classic was shot on a scant budget of 350000.The remake is produced by Raimi and Bruce Campbell who co-starred in the original. But this latter-day version as directed by Fede Alvarez goes overboard on the gruesome and scrimps on humor. Raimis Drag Me to Hell was a much funnierchill-fest.STORY Evil Dead gets resurrected for a new generationMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYSure this is a higher-budget re-tread. But a remake shouldnt exist simply to ramp up the graphic violence even if special effects have improved immeasurably in the past 30 years. Humor should be effectively tweaked too.And what about the fear factor? Re-making a horror flick seems pointless if it fails to frighten. Its billed as ""the most terrifying movie youll ever experience."" Hardly. While the grisly pandemonium is undeniable actual scares are in short supply.But if you must revisit the creepy cabin where a quintet of pals are terrorized by demonic forces be prepared for unrelenting gore. The film delivers blood guts and viscera by the gushing bucketful. Tongues are sliced arms are severed and faces punctured by nails.In the three decades since Raimi made Evil Dead many have copied adapted or borrowed from his low-budget playbook. Its tough to pull off something ingenious and truly horrifying. What made last years Cabin in the Woods such a smart and entertaining film was how it injected new life into a well-worn genre by adding an ingeniously clever meta-story.So when one of the five friends is possessed here and spouts nasty invective why must her voice sound like Regan in The Exorcist? Do all demons take over the vocal cords of their victims and utter the same kind of profanities?Mia (Jane Levy) is the possessed girl in question. Shes had a particularly rough go of it since arriving at her familys remote cabin to detox after struggling with drug addiction.Also on hand is her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez)  his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) and childhood pals Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci ) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas) who also happens to be a nurse. Olivia takes over the particulars of Mias woodsy intervention imposing a group staycation. Shes a tough taskmaster and also happens to be black. So guess whos the first demonized victim?.The rustic dwelling is the worse for wear since Mia and David last visited. But thats the least of its problems. The basement is essentially the tunnel to hell.The few laugh lines are delivered by Eric who is also the guy who stumbles on the ghastly tome that unleashes all manner of torment.Clearly scrawled across it is a dire warning ""Dont say it dont write it dont hear it.""An extra admonition should have been spelled out ""Dont remake it.""Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Something is VERY wrong with Mia (Jane Levy) in Evil Dead. 165 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 35 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/17fgGHw",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/04/04/evil-dead-review/2023663/,200,evildead(2013)7,evildead(2013),usatoday

On the other hand you wouldnt want the job of cleaning up after it.Awash in slapstick carnage with bodies that spew gush rupture and die hard in myriad ways the film directed by Raimis Uruguayan protege Fede Alvarez is a respectful homage to the foundation film in a proudly disreputable genre. So long as you grit your teeth and keep your eyes on the screen its an enjoyable if almost academic exercise in bad taste. Screen grab from online trailer for ""Evil Dead"" Movies Evil Dead The official trailer Unlike so many horrifyingly dull horror reboots of the past decade Evil Dead (the definite article has been amputated) is crafted with awareness of the franchises attentive fan base. That means the film (the fourth in the Evil Dead series) is deliberately familiar in its plot sepia-colour palette swooping demon-cam shots and preference for old-fashioned prosthetics over CGI effects. But the well-edited new version succeeds at stirring some fresh gusto into the familiar pot of gore.Unlike the carefree kids of 1981 - Michigan students on spring break - this group of young professionals is convening in a remote location with a moral purpose. David (Shiloh Fernandez) a young mechanic arrives at a dilapidated cabin along with his bland blond new girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) where the old gang is already gathered. They include a bossy nurse Olivia (Jessica Lucas) who seems to be Davids touchy ex and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) a hippie school teacher who resembles Beavis and Butt-heads Mr. Van Driessen and has some similar emotional-betrayal issues. They have reunited to assist Davids dark-eyed sullen sister Mia (Jane Levy) get off heroin by going cold turkey. The troubled Mia also has a beef with David because he left her with the responsibility of taking care of their dying mentally ill mother.The Screenplay 101 backstory is designed to make this a tale about Davids fight to overcome his habitual wussiness though character conflicts are significant only in the films first 15 minutes before the fun begins. After Mias drug-withdrawal symptoms start to kick in she has her first supernatural encounter in the woods where in a repeat of the original film she is sexually assaulted by a tree. (Otherwise the film is so careful in maintaining its non-explicit rating that Mia even takes a shower while partly dressed.)Back in the cabin the others assume her agitated state is a symptom of withdrawal and they are determined to keep her confined in the cabin whatever she says or does. The discovery of a basement full of strung-up charred dead-cat carcasses and a book of black magic doesnt convince them otherwise and they stick to the plan even when Mias demonic possession goes viral.Most of the films final hour involves the characters employing the cabins inventory of available weapons - shot gun electric carving knife nail gun utility knife shovel boiling water gasoline toilet-tank cover chainsaw - to mutilate themselves and each other in splatterific and - judging by the preview audiences gasps groans and laughter - crowd-pleasing ways.As to the laughter element the presence of Diablo Cody (Juno Young Adult) as one of the three credited script writers leads to an expectation of more verbal comedy here. Possibly her contribution got lost in the rewrites. Apart from a couple of one-liners from Eric as the designated supernatural explainer the humour here arises almost entirely from the hyperbolic violence which more than 30 years after Raimis original movie shocker feels familiar and almost safely outrageous.

Released unrated (its eventual home-video incarnation got an NC-17) it became both a midnight-movie hit and a rite of passage. ""Hey you wanna go catch `The Evil Dead at the Waverly?"" Making it through was like finally being tall enough to ride the roller coaster. Well now more than 30 years later -- and minus an article -- ""Evil Dead"" is back complete with extreme body modifications arboreal sexual assault and more blood than an abattoir. (But after an appeal to the ratings board only an R rating.) And its likely to become a midnight-movie hit and rite of passage all over again. But is it a brand-new gorehouse classic? Close but not quite. The original film was a labor of sick love by then-college student Sam Raimi who shot it with friends. It had a truly mad spirit -- at times you wondered if the filmmaker was as insane as his characters -- and ground-breaking camerawork and pace (Joel Coen was one of the editors). It felt like and was something new. Whats onscreen now -- shepherded there by Raimi and original star Bruce Campbell who served as producers -- is instead literally derivative. Once again we have five young people a remote cabin a book of spells that someone makes the mistake of reading aloud. And then all hell breaks loose. For real. Unfortunately whats onscreen often feels not just familiar but carefully photocopied. Its one thing to reprise the plot; its another to mimic the original movies signature shot with the camera low and racing pell-mell through the woods. Theres also a new and oddly misogynist undertone. Its not just that its only the women who quickly ""turn"" and have to be beaten into bloody submission by the men; even before the horror strikes theyre seen as impediments. Our heroes have a fine bromance going; if only these gals wouldnt be such nags and screwups. You have to wonder if Diablo Cody who did a script polish noticed that or even added it ""ironically."" But this is already probably too much thought to give a movie whose only aim is to scare the cheese and crackers out of you. Which director Fede Alvarez -- another in the New Wave of Latino horror auteurs -- does pretty consistently. The film has a beautiful score by Rogue Banos and some sinuous camerawork (Alvarez is fond of creeping up slowly on characters whose backs are turned to us). He also smartly twists terror tropes from a takeoff on the medicine-cabinet cliche to an upside-down reversal of the opening of ""The Shining."" And although the casting is spotty (heroine Jane Levy pulls one particularly laughable expression and Shiloh Rodriguez is simply a drip as our hero) Lou Taylor Pucci adds a lot of humor and energy as the high-school teacher in aviator glasses whos smarter than the rest of them -- but not quite smart enough. But be warned that despite those nice touches by Alvarez this is not a film which gets most of its effects from atmosphere or by slowly ratcheting up the tension. You want sophisticated scares? Go rent ""The Orphanage"" again or ""The Devils Backbone."" This is a movie literally awash in blood body parts and vomit. Its a fun spookshow -- if chainsaw violence is your idea of fun -- but its sure not my ""The Evil Dead."" But thats OK. Its someone elses now. Ratings note The film contains extremely graphic violence gore a sexual assault strong language and drug references. The Evil Dead (R) TriStar (91 min.) Directed by Fede Alvarez.

"Review Evil Dead is a gleeful gory goofy good time - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Evil Dead is a gleeful gory goofy good timeJane Levy stars as a young woman trying to kick a drug habit with friends in a cabin in the woods in Fede Alvarezs right-tone take on the cult horror classic.April 04 2013|By Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times A demonic force is unleashed in ""Evil Dead."" (TriStar Pictures )Among the household items put to unintended use in the new film ""Evil Dead"" a playfully reverent if not-overly-so remake of Sam Raimis 1981 cult favorite horror movie are a nail gun an electric knife a jerry-rigged defibrillator and in an obvious nod to the original a chain saw.The feature debut of Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez discovered via a short on YouTube ""Evil Dead"" has a gleeful exuberance of its own analogous to the mad invention of the original which in the years since its release has become wildly influential and in its own little-movie-that-could way downright inspirational.Written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues (with an uncredited but acknowledged polish by Diablo Cody) the story like its predecessor begins with five young people arriving at a secluded cabin in the woods. Mia (Jane Levy) is trying to kick a drug habit cold turkey with the others (Shiloh Fernandez Jessica Lucas Lou Taylor Pucci and Elizabeth Blackmore) along for support.PHOTOS Scenes from Evil DeadAfter discovering a mysterious book bound in human skin they unleash a demonic force that wants them all dead and pits them against one another.The new film is produced by Raimi Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell (writer-director producer and star of the 1981 movie respectively) and nimbly walks the fine line of tribute update and doing its own thing.What this ""Evil Dead"" gets most right is its tone paying homage yet staking its own territory; its scary without being downbeat fun without being too jokey. Levy in particular is perfectly in sync with Alvarezs mix of sincerity snark and scares.Alvarez certainly seems to have relished the chance to splatter and spray his cast with all manner of goo. His aesthetic is a few shades lighter than the gloomy grunge of other recent horror reinventions and he never loses sight of the black comedy lurking in the storys corners.But back to the goo. There is plenty of over-the-top gore great gushing geysers of it. Yet one of the most squirm-inducing moments a apart from the notorious still difficult-to-justify ""tree rape"" scene a isnt from a Grand Guignol spurt of blood but rather a relatively minor cut as a machete blade slices across the top of a bent knee.Its a sensation one can actually relate to as opposed to something like the gruesome slapstick of slipping on a shorn-off piece of someone elses face.Respectfully aware of its origins a including a wait-for-it tag after the end credits a ""Evil Dead"" is something of a forward-looking throwback. Its unlikely the movie will gain the same ardent following as Raimis debut but it offers enough good-time gore goofiness scares and screams to leave an audience feeling a certain elated exhaustion.mark.olsenlatimes.comEvil DeadMPAA rating R for strong bloody violence and gore some sexual content and languageRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesPlaying In general release MORE FROM HERO COMPLEX HERO COMPLEX Pop culture unmasked PHOTOS 60 images from The Hobbit VIDEO GAMES The latest news and reviews MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSXSW 2013 Evil Dead remake is ridiculous in a good wayMarch 9 20132013 movie sneak previewsJanuary 13 2013A ripe season of celluloidMay 1 2011Opening the treasure chestMay 7 2006MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowEvil DeadNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-evil-dead-review-remake-20130405,0,4838967.story",200,evildead(2013)11,evildead(2013),latimes

Slideshow Remake stays true to the gory original Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Evil Dead >> Cult favorites all three they launched Raimis career - he ascended to blockbuster status with Spider-Man - and that of his leading man that most un-Method of actors B-film hero Bruce Campbell. The influence of Raimis films on the genre cant be exaggerated - as recently as 2011 they were reinvoked and saluted in Drew Goddards masterful gory love letter to H.P. Lovecraft The Cabin in the Woods. Raimi has wanted to update and remake Evil Dead for years. But his fan base went into a collective panic when that possibility became a reality in 2009 when Raimi signed Uruguayan TV commercial director Fede Alvarez to write and direct the picture. It was blasphemy pure and simple. And we knew every one of us that it would be a disaster. Happily Raimi who co-produced the film with Campbell was right to trust his instincts. Alvarez who was discovered after posting his brilliant 2009 self-produced YouTube short Panic Attack was the right man for the job. While its impossible to surpass the original - so much of its fame is a function of its time - Alvarezs version still manages to measure up. Alvarezs Evil Dead is about a young woman named Mia (Jane Levy) who is desperate to kick her drug addiction. She asks her estranged brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and three of their closest friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) to make her go cold turkey by keeping her in her familys remote vacation home a little cabin in the woods. Things go very very wrong when Eric discovers an old creepy-looking book - its bound in human skin and wrapped with barbed wire - opens it and begins reading its strange incantations out loud. (I mean who wouldnt?) He awakens a demon and it begins possessing our heroes one by one tearing them apart in many novel ways. Much blood and gore is generated (even more than youll anticipate). Like Raimis original some of the violence is so over-the-top youll find yourself laughing - if you recover from the initial shock. Alvarez triumphs because he made one crucial decision Avoid digital animation and use only practical in-camera special effects. He uses every trick from classic Hollywood and invents a few of his own. It pays off allowing the actors to react to physical phenomena - of the bone-crunching arm-sawing sort - which in turn makes the audience cringe in horror. Alvarez is a great new talent to watch. His Evil Dead will delight Raimi fans while also giving them a renewed appreciation for the original. Contact Tirdad Derakhshani at 215-854-2736 or tirdadphillynews.com.

Raimis 1981 debut is a masterpiece of punk filmmaking a bunch of young enthusiasts who barely knew what they were doing going out into the woods and stumbling blindly into the creation of a ragged landmark -- largely because they didnt know didnt care or didnt have the money to do it the way it was supposed to be done. Luckily Alvarez for whom Evil Dead is also a debut feature doesnt try to replicate the practically accidental glory of that film. With studio money and Raimi and original star Bruce Campbell on board as producers this Evil Dead is polished and meticulously planned and it benefits from the attention to detail as well as from Alvarezs obvious love for the spirit of the source material. The basic archetypal framework is the same Five 20-somethings head to a remote forest location accidentally unleash unspeakable evil via a flesh-bound book of rituals and incantations and fall prey to malevolent soul-devouring demons. But the first major shift that Alvarez and co-writer Rodo Sayagues introduce is giving these characters a little more depth and purpose. Eschewing the usual recreational reasons for the cabin-in-the-woods template their purpose here is a forced detox for Mia (Jane Levy). Shiloh Fernandez plays Mias brother David wholl emerge as the closest analog to Ash Bruce Campbells original hero. Making the two leads family instead of romantically involved opens things up for all sorts of easily established family baggage that while it sometimes tips toward the maudlin does give the film higher emotional stakes and a greater sense of purpose than its predecessor. Fernandez wears a near-constant expression of brow-furrowed concern that makes sense for the guilt-ridden brother hes been written as. But when things start to go bad one does miss the oversized B-movie charisma of Campbell whos a big part of why the near-wordless latter third of the original works so well. Fernandez is an interchangeable protagonist present to take his considerable lumps but never a driving force or an unforgettable center for the chaotic storm of blood and mayhem that the film becomes. The long-suffering Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) a bookish schoolteacher responsible for unleashing the demons in the first place winds up being far more memorable if only for the severity and quantity of carnage thats inflicted on him. Mia (Jane Levy) is possessed by an army of demons in Fede Alvarezs gruesomely affectionate homage to the Sam Raimi classic. TriStar Pictures hide caption toggle caption TriStar Pictures But its Mia who winds up as the central figure here despite spending most of the movie possessed by demonic forces so vulgar and brutal that they make The Exorcists malevolent entity look like a Catholic schoolgirl. But all these comparisons with the original and all the dithering over whether the increased plot complexity works or not are really secondary. The important question is the simplest Is it scary? On the surface that looks like a bone-crunching yes The number of people visibly cringing shrinking into their seats hiding their faces and reacting audibly during the screening I attended rivals any other horror film Ive ever watched with an audience. But making people cringe is easy; any third-rate Saw knockoff can manage it. Alvarez combines a talent for genuine skin-crawling creepiness with an unhinged sense of the gruesome -- qualities that demonstrate exactly why Raimi hand-picked him to make this film. So while the film is bathed in buckets of blood and torn flesh Alvarezs heavy chumming of the water never feels like its only purpose is to show how far hes willing to push the envelope. And while the overriding mood is desperately grim Alvarez like Raimi does have a sense of humor. This is no horror-comedy like Raimis Evil Dead sequels but it does match the original in creating occasional and surprising moments of well-timed humor amid what is otherwise straight horror. A particularly effective sequence involving a weaponized nail gun and a grisly sight gag following a self-amputation quite effectively blur the line between the two while a cameo of the 73 Oldsmobile from the original ends up being a laugh-worthy moment of pure fan service. Effective scares respectful nods to its inspiration and a few new twists make the question of whether this new Evil Dead succeeds in matching its inspiration superfluous. This is one remake that succeeds on its own blood-soaked terms.

David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Will you enjoy the ""Evil Dead"" remake? If you have fond memories of the original probably not. If you would like to see the movie equivalent of an explosion in a tomato-soup factory however this is the film for you. Its been more than 30 years since Sam Raimis giddy zombie splatterfest ""The Evil Dead"" delighted a generation of gorehounds. A warped twist on the horror-thriller genre it set five college students in a haunted backwoods cabin and put them through a meat grinder more or less literally. The poverty-row production boasted a raw punk-rock energy outlandish special effects (one actress violation by a demon-infested tree is the nastiest arboreal atrocity ever filmed) and the exceptional charm and charisma of Bruce Campbell as the square-jawed protagonist. The elements blended in a brew so intoxicating that viewers didnt know whether to recoil in fright or jump for joy. Now comes the remake a 21st-century ""Evil Dead"" with superior technique a giant budget for stage blood and a quintet of fresh better qualified actors as the cosmically unlucky protagonists. Bloody havoc? Check. Exuberant gore? Check. Fun? Meh. It opens promisingly. When a film starts with a frightened young woman running through the woods from ominous pursuers you might think you know whats coming. The prologue cleverly flips the script shuffling villains and antiheroes in a way that puts us off balance (and covers the camera lens with brain matter). After that brief introduction however the rusty conveyor belt of conventional scare tactics rumbles into operation. David (Shiloh Fernandez) takes his heroin-addicted younger sister Mia (Jane Levy) deep into the woods to help her go cold turkey. Also babysitting the junkie are old friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) with Davids girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore). No one gets more than 30 seconds worth of characterization. Blackmores character may as well be named The Blonde One. Eric a teacher does have one salient attribute curiosity. Of the killed-the-cat variety. When the group discovers a book bound with human skin and tied shut with barbed wire he cant resist clipping it open and reciting the incantations. His other hobbies must include kicking hornets nests and smoking near open gas cans. Feed Loader Lou Taylor Pucci left Jessica Lucas Shiloh Fernandez Jane Levy and Elizabeth Blackmore in ""Evil Dead."" Soon Mia is warning that she senses dire spirits visions the others chalk up to drug withdrawal. Next thing you know its eerie reflections in the mirror full-body skin peels a possessed Linda Blair creep-alike spewing vile profanities and ""127 Hours""-style self-amputation. First-time director Fede Alvarez -- who made a sensation with his 2009 YouTube sci-fi short ""Panic Attack""-- knows the fright-movie playbook by heart. Unfortunately so do we. Levy who has huge expressive eyes and Pucci whose character absorbs enough punishment to exhaust a hospital trauma ward make helpful contributions.

"Evil Dead | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; evil-dead ) Evil Dead (United States 2013) April 04 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its tempting to look at the 2013 reincarnation of Evil Dead as yet another pointless remake of an 80s horror film. Havent there been enough of these? One glance at the credit list reveals that both director Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell (of the original The Evil Dead) are on board as producers. Surely that has to mean something doesnt it? Apparently not. Evil Dead is a generic horror movie noteworthy only because it may be the most bloodsoaked motion picture to bamboozle the MPAA into getting an ""R"" rating. This isnt just a horror movie with gore - its a gore movie period. Blood is its raison detre. Its not scary. Its not shocking. It just wallows in viscera. Ho-hum. Pass the ketchup. Of course The Evil Dead was known in its day for copious amounts of blood. (When re-submitted for its video release the originally ""unrated"" film was granted an ""NC-17"" by the MPAA and its tamer than the remake.) The thing is Raimi was having fun with all that red dyed liquid. While its true that The Evil Dead was more serious than its immediate successor Evil Dead II it wasnt meant to be taken entirely seriously. The over-the-top gore and cheesy acting were all part of what made the film work. And it was atmospheric and scary in ways that the remake utterly fails to capture. Fede Alvarezs take on Evil Dead is glum and almost entirely devoid of anything resembling humor. As a result all that blood simply seemsa|excessive. The movie is all about the gore and the technical aptitude with which it has been produced (mostly without CGI). Everything is secondary. Theres no heart no soul and not a lot of creativity. And the hole left by Bruce Campbells absence is never effectively filled. (Although old-time fans of The Evil Dead are advised to stick around through the end credits.) The core premise remains the same five college-age men and women head off to a dilapidated cabin in the woods. Theyre staging an intervention designed to get Mia (Jane Levy) off the drugs that have consumed her life. Her four supporters are her estranged brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his personality-devoid girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) registered nurse Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and bookish Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). In the cabins dim dank basement they discover a bunch of dead cats and the Necronomicon a grimoire made from human skin that contains dark magic spells. Eric in an act of overt stupidity starts reading things from the Necronomicon out loud and suddenly the five friends are being hunted by a demon. The ending which deviates significantly from that of Raimis original is easily the weakest aspect of the thinly-potted movie. Its confusing contradictory and downright dumb. In homage to Raimi the shaky-cam makes an appearance. And theres a chainsaw. But no Ash - aspects of that character have been parceled out between two or three of the new cabin-mates. In 1981 we knew who to root for. Thats not the case here. None of the five individuals who enter the cabin capture our sympathy. In the end its tough to care whether any of them makes it out alive. But Alvarez doesnt appear especially interested in directing actors. Hes the gore-man. Evil Dead feels a lot like a hybrid between last decades so-called ""torture porn"" and a more conventional movie about demon possession. The biggest element absent from Evil Dead is the sense of inspiration in which Raimis iteration marinated. So much effort was invested into making the blood and gore look ""right"" that all the other elements of good horror - particularly the sense of dread - are relegated to the background. Those who are calling Evil Dead the ""scariest movie ever made"" dont have a good understanding of the word ""scary."" Evil Dead is another reminder of the folly of trying to remake genre classics while the originals retain their effectiveness. Theres no debating that Alvarezs Evil Dead looks slicker than Raimis. That comes with having a budget. But there are no other improvements. In fact in almost every other aspect Evil Dead is at least a step behind The Evil Dead and while the storyline heads in a different direction during its third act making the ending a little unpredictable its hard to summon the energy to care. If the filmmakers dont want to invest much in the characters why should the viewers? Evil Dead is like a childs bauble - shiny and sparkling on the outside but of inferior quality to something shaped by a master craftsman. Ill not claim that Raimis version is anything close to perfection but this pointless remake serves only to elevate it in my estimation.

(Though tsk tsk to them.) Its ultimately everything a modern horror movie should be.The original directed by Sam Raimi with Bruce Campbell in the lead role traced five college friends who travel to a cabin in the woods -- never a safe place -- for some fun. They unearth a ""Book of the Dead"" that releases demons to ensure no one gets out alive.""Evil Dead"" 2013 sticks to the basic blueprint though an effective prelude is added depicting a possessed girl burned at the stake by her own father.Turns out that burning took place in the basement of a cabin where David (Shiloh Fernandez) his drug-addicted sister Mia (Jane Levy of ""Suburgatory"") Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) are visiting.But they arent there for good times. Its a detox intervention weekend for Mia and theyve made a pact to not let her leave no matter how bad things get.Its not long before things spiral straight to hell as soon as Eric unwraps and reads from a barbwire-bound ""Book of the Dead."" Mia totally over the intervention bolts -- with dire consequences including a nasty entanglement with tree branches and her quick demonic takeover.The setup is clever. Mias ramblings of what happened to her in the forest are dismissed as druggie hallucinations. But its clear something is really wrong with Mia who promises theyre all going to die and whatever is wrong is deeper than dope.The possession nothing like the PG-13 possession seen in movies such as ""The Last Exorcist"" and ""The Devil Inside"" takes over the characters quickly as they dismember themselves before turning on each other. Cue the nail gun chainsaw knives and more.Director Fede Alvarez doesnt compromise going all out as the cast does unspeakable things tripping over each other in efforts to push the hard R rating. He also keeps the tone serious and straightforward never falling into what came off as camp in the original.The new movie does Raimi and Campbell proud; theyre both listed as producers.

RELATED NEWS Interview Director Bruce Campell talk new Evil Dead By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Apr 4 2013 1014 AM Well they certainly didnt skimp on the gore. Not that there was ever much doubt about that. If youve got the guts to tackle another version of ""The Evil Dead"" youd better be prepared to spill some well guts. And in ""Evil Dead"" director Fede Alvarez spills plenty. Whether you think its a good movie will depend largely upon your stomach for gruesome violence. Then again if you are going to see a movie called ""Evil Dead"" youre probably going to be OK. Seeing Sam Raimis ""Evil Dead"" trilogy isnt required to enjoy this new take. Indeed ""Evil Dead II"" was more a funnier slicker remake of ""The Evil Dead"" than it was a sequel. Although if you havent seen them you might wonder whats causing the nervous laughter in the audience when Alvarez shows us a chain saw. Alvarez who co-wrote the script offers yet another take on Raimis story. But all traces of camp and humor have been removed. This is full-on horror relentless and if youre into that sort of thing bracing. But you do have to be into that sort of thing. The setup is similar to the first two ""Evil Dead"" films and to any number of other horror films. Five friends head out to a remote cabin in the woods where events will conspire to keep them stranded. In this case its the drug addiction of Mia (Jane Levy). She has come with her friends and her semiestranged brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) to go cold turkey. Thats a pretty good setup. Whatever craziness Mia sees and experiences and eventually causes can be written off to kicking heroin. At least for a while. And there is plenty of craziness. The catalyst for all of it is as in the other films the Necronomicon or book of the dead. Ancient text written on human skin with blood. Its wrapped in barbed wire and there are warnings all over it to not repeat its chants aloud. Well yes. But this is a horror movie. As Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) studies the text he of course repeats the chants and evil is unleashed and we are once again treated to impossibly fast tracking shots through the woods as the demons race toward the cabin and the people inside many of whom they will possess and cause to do unspeakable (at times nearly unwatchable) things. Theres a weird comfort in those tracking shots so familiar from the other films. Alvarez does a good job balancing the familiar and the new offering enough homage to Raimis versions to satisfy fans without overdoing it. Of course he overdoes the violence. Thats part of the point. Alvarez comes up with new and excruciating ways to make you hide your eyes. One might argue that such gratuitous violence serves no purpose other than to gross you out. Yet that is its purpose. There is nothing about ""Evil Dead"" as groundbreaking as Raimis films (particularly the first two). But its smarter and better done than a lot of whats come since those movies were made which is to say there is at least some thought behind the killings. The thoughts belong to Raimi as much or more than they do Alvarez but at least theyre there. One further note Stick around till the credits are done. Its worth your while.

CAST Jane Levy Shiloh Fernandez Lou Taylor Pucci LENGTH 130 Back in 1981 Sam Raimis low-budget horror film ""The Evil Dead"" introduced us to five college students in a remote cabin who discover a book containing a malevolent spirit. There wasnt much more to the story because Raimi was too busy inventing cheap ways to jolt his audience and his clever camerawork helped a little ketchup and oatmeal go a long way. It was Raimis visuals and certainly not his script (""Gaah Yaargh"") that made the movie so memorable. After more than 30 years of sequels comics and video games based on Raimis movie you might expect the first remake ""Evil Dead"" to gorge itself on the splashier effects that a bigger budget can buy. It does but it also pointlessly fancies up the story with elaborate character histories interpersonal dramas and expositional flashbacks. As a result ""Evil Dead"" turns Raimis homemade horror treat into a professional-looking overscripted bore.

Our new heroes are David (Shiloh Fernandez); his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore); Olivia (Jessica Lucas) a nurse; and schoolteacher Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). Theyre estranged friends who have convened at the cabin to help Davids younger sister Mia (Jane Levy) kick her drug habit. Its scholarly Eric who discovers the book which possesses Mia first and everyone initially chalks up her hysteria to withdrawal. Soon however her googly-eyed murderous behavior starts to spread. Debut director Fede Alvarez and his co-writer Rodo Sayagues repeat some of Raimis wiggier ideas (the scantily clad Mia discovers a plant species thats startlingly invasive) and they try to match his go-for-broke spirit with numerous gougings puncturings and dismemberments. But the moments of pathos and symbolism not to mention an overcomplicated ""MacGyver""-esque climax add nothing to the movie and only spoil the fun.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 1233pm on Friday Apr. 05 2013 Friday Apr. 05 2013 Thursday Apr. 04 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Sam Raimis 1981 cult indie-horror classic The Evil Dead and its smarter cooler follow-up Evil Dead II from 1987 are the Rosetta Stone for the hack-and-splatter crowd.If you want to know how to make a movie about a bunch of young idiots who think its a good idea to camp out in a creepy cabin in an even creepier part of the woods and release some soul-hungry spirit -- and do it all with a biting (pun intended) sense of humor -- these are your go-to guides. On top of that these movies -- along with the third film in the series Army of Darkness -- acted as blood-drenched calling cards for a director who would go on to make the first three Spider-Man films.But except for those just looking at the bottom line there was no need for a remake. Yet thats exactly what we get in Evil Dead a bigger-budget ""re-imagining"" with Raimi as producer and upstart Uruguayan filmmaker Fede Alvarez (whose short Panic Attack became something of an underground sensation) directing and co-writing. (Diablo Cody of Juno fame is also listed as a writer.)The result is far from an embarrassment unlike say Gus Van Sants 1998 remake of Psycho. Evil Dead is an efficient exceedingly grisly horror film that goes places that Raimi could only dream of in the 80s when he was working with 5 and a bottle of ketchup. And there are some clever nods to the original thrown in that probably will sail right over the heads of anyone not familiar with it.Yet without the low-rent cheesiness and the hint of horseplay that made the originals so enjoyable Evil Dead becomes a numbing exercise in overkill. Literally.The setup this time is that five friends have gotten together in this remote location to help one of their own -- Mia (Jane Levy) -- kick her substance-abuse problem. Shes doing it cold turkey and what better way than in a place with no distractions? The friends include her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and even someone with medical training Olivia (Jessica Lucas).But its Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) who finds the dusty Book of the Dead in the cabin and -- despite the explicit warnings that nothing from it should be read aloud without dire consequences -- proceeds to read from it. (Certainly the IQs of the characters havent improved since 1981.)Faster than you can say ""Have you guys never seen a horror movie before?"" a demon is unleashed that initially takes possession of Mia before moving on to the others.Its all delivered with the requisite scares as Alvarez often effectively ramps up the tension.Yet after awhile its hard to care too much about whats going on as the bloodletting escalates into bloodbath and Evil Dead becomes less a film and more an exercise in shock tactics.No doubt Evil Dead will please the hard-core gore fans. But anyone who prefers their jolts with tongues firmly in cheek instead of bloodily on the outside should stick with Evil Dead 1.0.Cary Darling 817-390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

(Kirsty Griffin) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday April 4 2013 1200 PM Title Evil Dead Film Info R Extreme violence and gore strong language. Area theaters. Fede Alvarezs single-minded ""Evil Dead"" does not waste a second on pleasantries so we might as well follow his lead. Heres what youll get in Alvarezs much-anticipated debut a reboot of Sam Raimis 1981 horror landmark Decapitations. Projectile vomiting. Burnings and bludgeonings. And yes arboreal assault. The ""tree rape"" scene from Raimis influential ""The Evil Dead"" remains the most famous in a film that shocked audiences with its brutality. This movie is likely to do the same though its surprising to see that Raimi and original star Bruce Campbell are the producers of a straightforward effort -- especially after Drew Goddard and Joss Whedons ""Cabin in the Woods"" exploded the genres cliches last year. Those cliches are back in full force with five friends spending a weekend at well a cabin in the woods. Their goal is to help Mia (Jane Levy of ""Suburgatory"") kick her heroin habit. But then Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) finds a weird book in the basement. Naturally he ignores every warning and begins reading. Soon demons are summoned to the house invade Mia and cause all sorts of ultra-bloody mayhem. The script -- written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues and polished by an uncredited Diablo Cody -- makes a brief effort at backstory between Mia and her brother (Shiloh Fernandez). But Alvarez is primarily interested in upping his corpse count in the most gruesome ways imaginable. In this he is undeniably successful. He also establishes an effectively breathless pace and weaves in a steady stream of fan-friendly references. While most of the participants are disposable Levy and the always-excellent Pucci work hard to induce the blunt desperation of the original. Still while that film -- and its sequels ""Evil Dead II"" and ""Army of Darkness"" -- impacted countless followers this one is no game-changer. Shiloh Fernandez plays Jane Levys brother in Evil Dead. (Kirsty Griffin) Theres always room for something new even in the most recycled of settings. Just for starters Raimi added humor Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez (""The Blair Witch Project"") exploited found footage Eli Roth (""Cabin Fever"") went meta and Whedon and Goddard blew the whole concept apart. Though Alvarez keeps us watching he takes no real chances. Buried under all those enthusiastically mangled bodies is the comfort of familiarity. He may have intended to remake a single film but weve seen this movie countless times before. Magic moment Mia makes excellent use of a chainsaw. eweitzmannydailynews.com On mobile?

Of course then Id have missed another character being severed lengthwise with a chain saw while some members of the audience hooted in approval. Gorehounds will have a field day with the plentiful mutilations decapitations and other blood-drenched moments in the redo. It amazingly sports an R rating though its far grislier than Sam Raimis 1981 original (which was initially released without a rating but acquired an NC-17 for a 1995 re-release). The effects are also far more realistic than there were in the bargain-basement original from 32 years ago. Which means that instead of spoofing the excesses of that eras slasher films theyre basically being offered up for the delectation of contemporary moviegoers. While there were a couple of squeamish walkouts many young men and women at the promotional screening I attended seemed to enjoy watching victims being shot at with nail guns whacked on the head with crowbars or cutting off a piece of their face with a jagged piece of glass. Besides gallons of blood theres no small amount of urine as well as a scene where a woman is raped by a plant. Acting is sort of besides the point in a movie like this which has the performers spouting deliberately ridiculous dialogue and constantly risking their lives in ways that no sane person would. The setting is a remote cabin the woods -- conveniently cut off by a flash flood -- where a heroin-addicted young woman (Jane Levy) has been brought to try to go cold turkey. When she starts having delusions and warning everyone they wont live through the night they have to wonder if its a symptom of withdrawal or because the most dweebish guy (Lou Taylor Pucci) has started reading incantations from a mysterious old book he found. Also along for the gory gory night are the junkies long-estranged brother (Shiloh Fernandez) and a student nurse (Jessica Lucas) whose skill at suturing wounds with duct tape comes in handy. Though it tries -- with a much too heavy hand -- the new ""Evil Dead is far less humorous than its predecessor which catapulted director Raimi and star Bruce Campbell (who produced this one) into long mainstream careers. Which is not to say this ""Evil Dead reboot wont also beget sequels.

Evil Dead (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Evil Dead (R) This remake of the 1983 cult classic is heavy on gore but light on frights. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/4/2013 Editor rating 2 When The Evil Dead invaded movie theaters in 1983 it detonated an atomic bomb on a stale horror-film genre overrun by masked killers and teen slashers. Made on a tiny budget sporting Stephen Kings personal seal of approval and released unrated for its violence the movie launched the careers of actor Bruce Campbell (Burn Notice) director Sam Raimi (Spider-Man) and producer Robert G. Tapert (TVs Spartacus War of the Damned). Watching it with an audience was a riotous experience People screamed and laughed and gasped in shock at the demonic visions these unknown filmmakers had conjured up making Freddy and Jason and Michael seem like schoolyard wimps. Now comes the remake more plainly titled Evil Dead which ups the violence and gore and craziness but still feels strangely quaint. This is not merely another rip-off reboot of an established classic like the recent A Nightmare on Elm Street and Texas Chainsaw Massacre redos. Campbell Raimi and Tapert were all closely involved with the project and first-time director Fede Alvarez who hails from Uruguay has a strong visual style and a taste for the gruesome. He knows how to compose beautiful nightmarish visuals. He pays clever homage to the original without imitating it slavishly and he has higher production values and a bigger budget which means all the more blood to splash across the screen. So why isnt there a single good scare in the entire film? This is not a matter of being overly familiar with the first film Alvarez has made enough changes to make the movie his own beginning with an actual premise other than good-looking college students partying in the woods. Mia (Jane Levy) is a drug addict trying to get clean so she invites her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and some of their friends to her parents cabin to support her as she goes through the painful process of withdrawal. Soon though Mia is looking like Linda Blair in The Exorcist and telling her pals theyre all going to die there. They think shes going through some scary jonesing and lock her in a cellar. Curiously Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) forgets to tell anyone he found a book bound in human skin sealed with barbed wire and illustrated with demonic drawings which he opened and read out loud even though it wasnt even written in English summoning some ancient evil force. If you saw last years genre-deconstruction The Cabin in the Woods Erics book-reading will make you think of Sigourney Weaver. You will think of her several times after that too which doesnt help Evil Dead in the fright department. The characters are interchangeable and dont even seem to like each other much which makes it hard to care when they start dying or losing body parts. The main selling point of the 1983 version was the game-changing gore the over-the-top acting the ingenious effects and its warped sense of humor. But the new Evil Dead contains none of those things. Its a dour humorless movie and although its 100 times bloodier it still got away with an R (even the squeamish ratings board wasnt impressed). Evil Dead isnt an actively bad movie like so many current horror remakes are and it contains images that stay with you (including one long shot near the end involving a chainsaw). But the movie is low on energy and thrills. It lacks the exuberance of the original and it doesnt creep you out either. Its a horror movie made by a director who obviously loves the genre but cant do much other than imitate. The Evil Dead was an absolute blast. Evil Dead is just a well-made gross-out and its kind of a bummer. Cast Jane Levy Shiloh Fernandez Lou Taylor Pucci Jessica Lucas Elizabeth Blackmore. Director Fede Alvarez. Screenwriters Fede Alvarez Rodo Sayagues. Producers Bruce Campbell Sam Raimi Robert G. Tapert. A TriStar Pictures release. Running time 91 minutes.

"Evil Dead is the lesser of two Evils review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEvil Dead is the lesser of two Evils reviewRemake Evil Dead arrives 32 years after Sam Raimis The Evil Dead and the social gulf between the two couldnt be wider.Evil Dead is indeed gory and grotesque but thats no longer enough to shock us.  (Sony-TriStar)  Bruce Campbell was memorable as Ash in The Evil Dead the 1981 original that energized the horror genre.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 4 2013Evil DeadStarring Jane Levy Shiloh Fernandez Lou Taylor Pucci and Jessica Lucas. Directed by Fede Alvarez. 90 minutes. Opens April 5 at major theatres. 18AThe really scary thing about Fede Alvarezs Evil Dead is its failure to shock. Are we all now completely desensitized to movie horror?Arriving 32 years after Sam Raimis The Evil Dead shotgunned cabin terror into indie legend the social gulf between the two films couldnt be wider.Article Continued BelowThe 1981 original parlayed geek savvy improvised gross-out effects and inspired camera work (that swooping evil POV) into a splatterfest that appalled and delighted its Reagan-era audience. It was novel because it was so eager to go for broke and its two sequels added humour to its pulpy mix.The remake Evil Dead misfires because its content to play it safe in the process losing more than just the ""The"" from the title. Granted it has all the mutilation decapitation dismemberment sawing shooting roasting nailing puking burying buzz-sawing and screaming youd expect from an Evil Dead movie -- and consider this fair warning for anyone not already versed in franchise lore.This may be enough for some people and God love them for it. But its precisely because you expect all these things that Evil Dead inspires more tedium than terror at least for anyone who actually watches a lot of these kinds of movies.To startle a horror-savvy 2013 audience one used to the atrocities of the Saw and Hostel series and also the genre send-ups of Cabin in the Woods and the Scream franchise newcomer Alvarez would have had to considerably up the ante. Hed have had to push the material in ways that would have denied it the ""R"" rating it has stateside such as making it more sexually explicit. Thats something the fully corporatized Raimi producer of the remake likely wouldnt have countenanced.The infamous ""tree rape"" scene of The Evil Dead for example is reproduced in Evil Dead but it doesnt inspire the shock awe and loathing of the original. We know its coming -- the trailer teases it -- and when it does it just feels like a box that Alvarez has checked off on a long list of homages his film pays to its forebear. Hes gone so far as to eschew the use of modern CGI for his gore opting to stick with the messy physical effects of old. You can understand his dilemma. He doesnt want to earn the ire of fans or Raimi by diverting too much from the sacred text. Alvarezs screenplay co-written with Rodo Sayagues along with unspecified input from Diablo Cody doesnt stray much from the essential demonic cabin bloodbath scenario.You can also applaud what few changes Alvarez has attempted some of which work -- including Aaron Mortons moody lensing and a score by Roque Banos that uses sirens to nerve-rattling effect. But most simply fail.The cabin retreat is now a cold-turkey drug detoxing session rather than a horny kids-gone-wild weekend. Heavily addicted Mia (Jane Levy) is going to quit junk or die trying. Along for rehab assist are her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) and Mias friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). A prologue provides some history for the evil presence that haunts the cabin and also for a certain skin-covered plot device (which in this film should be called The Annotated Necronomicon). We further learn that strung-out Mia and low-key David are on the outs because David has been absent for much of her life. None of these new plot elements amount to much.Instead as per convention the evil is carelessly unleashed -- will kids never learn? It starts turning the cabin occupants one by one into zombified mutilators murderers and name-callers. Whats missing in all the mud blood and gore is stoic antihero Ash played so well by Bruce Campbell in the original series. He acts the way Jughead might if hed witnessed Archie Veronica Betty and Reggie being reduced to dog chow.Alvarez opted not to have an obvious Ash character in Evil Dead because he judged it impossible to replace him. The nearest equivalent is Fernandezs terminally vacant David who acts for most of the movie as if hes been ingesting more drugs than his sister.Maybe Alvarez should have tried anyway since its impossible to imagine the expected Evil Dead sequels without having someone around to make an Ash of himself. Do stick around past the credits though if only for the masochistic satisfaction of confirming what Evil Dead is lacking.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Evil Dead movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies More blood less wit when the Evil Dead return  Video Evil Dead remake not nearly as much fun Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips compares the new ""Evil Dead"" film to the 1983 original. Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips compares the new ""Evil Dead"" film to the 1983 original. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In the Book of the Dead the barbed-wire-wrapped volume causing the fuss in ""Evil Dead"" one lavishly illustrated page states that after the forest demon ""feasts on five souls the sky will bleed again."" Translated into franchise terms If this grim outlandish remake of the 1983 Sam Raimi film makes 50 million or more which it will the multiplex screens will weep once more with crimson tears. Sequel""Evil Dead"" offers the core audience for modern horror plenty of reasons to jump and then settle back tensely while awaiting the next idiotic trip down to the cellar beneath the demon-infested cabin in the woods. The most reliable jumper cable cinematically is the old trick you already know the sudden appearance of someone or something accompanied by that hackneyed metallic YeeeeeeUMMMMPPPP sound effect. The movies gore meanwhile goes straight to 11. Many dismemberings. Limitless liters of blood. The weaponry include nail guns chain saws and crowbars. Nothing stops these evil dead. As in the original one character suffers a grueling act of supernatural plant-based rape. As in the original the scene is offensive and throws you straight out of the movie in the name of upping the stakes.Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez making his feature debut manages a shrewd narrative variation or two on the original. Whats missing though -- by design -- is the jaunty kinetic exuberance of Raimis visual approach. You cant remake a sense of humor. Alvarez may well have one but itll have to wait for the next project. To its credit the new ""Evil Dead"" takes seriously the recovering-addict plight of its central character Mia played well and fiercely by Jane Levy. The premise here is simple Mias drug problems and her withdrawal confuse her senses. Her brother and her friends have brought her to the cabin in the woods to cure her. But is she seeing visions of demonic possession or is this simply the cold turkey playing tricks with her brain?""Evil Dead"" never had much plot and never made much sense. The demon jumps from human to human setting demonized human against regular human. But once inhabited and transformed the demonized human can be confined to a cellar? Really? Not in my experience.Back in the early Reagan era Raimi upped the violence to improbable levels. The original ""Evil Dead"" went out unrated rather than risk the demonic X from the Motion Picture Association of America. Yet each time Bruce Campbell appeared bug-eyed square-jawed and freaking out in close-up you knew this wasnt a standard horror film. Raimis camera was on fire It never stopped moving and it sprinted through the woods like something out of James Fenimore Cooper.Raimi and Campbell serve as producers on the remake which is rated R but is naturally 46 times as bloody as the original. Little of what Raimi brought to ""Evil Dead"" remains. (Except the remains.) All is dark sepia-toned artful in its murk and relentless and rather numbing in its geysers of bodily fluids. The original featured crummy writing and mostly (besides Campbells) bad acting but it was perverse and icky fun. The new one is better acted more carefully composed. But it feels like a lot of other remakes of 70s and 80s horror titles. Competent craftsmanship vacuous slickness. Its not bad. Its nowhere near the sub-basement level of ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" sadism. But its no ""Evil Dead 2"" even though we most certainly will be getting the remake ""Evil Dead 2"" in a year or two. mjphillipstribune.comEvil Dead -- 2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong bloody violence and gore some sexual content and language)Running time 131Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Evil Dead (movie 2013) Entertainment Motion Picture Association of America R Rated Movies Evil Dead Top 50 superhero movies of the last 10 years Who are the early Oscars 2014 favorites?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The signature shot of Sam Raimis Evil Dead movies has a dark force careening through a Grimm forest at breakneck speed as if released through the devils slingshot. Since the films are about the hell unleashed by readings from The Book Of The Dead they have an anything-goes relentlessness that mixes quick brutal shocks with Three Stooges elasticity. Produced with the high style and maximum viscera of Zack Snyders Dawn Of The Dead remake Fede Alvarezs appealingly nasty Evil Dead remake limits the Raimi wit but compensates with an all-out assault of demon possession mutilation and buckets of gore. And while Raimis Stooges aesthetic--which was really more prominently displayed in the sequels than in 1981s The Evil Dead--isnt played up here theres enough outrageous unreality to make the brutality go down a little easier. It isnt quite a cartoon but its close enough. Like an non-ironic version of the mechanized death parodied in last years The Cabin In The Woods Evil Dead gathers five good-looking young people in a rustic death trap set deep in the forest. The gummy premise has Shiloh Fernandez trying to reconnect with his estranged sister Jane Levy a heroin addict given one last chance to kick the habit for good. Then the discovery of a gruesome scene under the floorboards unearths a wire-bound copy of The Book Of The Dead. When their bookish friend (Lou Taylor Pucci) decides to crack it open and do a little heavy reading all hell breaks loose starting with Levy; her withdrawal was bound to lead to madness of a kind and when she channels a demon it none-too-subtly stands as a metaphor for her raging addiction. Co-writer/director Alvarez a Uruguayan who first gained notice on YouTube with his striking short ""Panic Attack"" doesnt seem all that invested in the sibling relationship thats cynically acts as the films emotional core. But he has a clear zeal for bloody mayhem and the chops to make a hodgepodge of borrowed gestures from The Exorcist and Raimi movies seem bracing again. At a certain point the characters reticence to take action makes no sense Levys addiction is supposed to account for her ""crazy"" behavior but Evil Dead often seems like the type of movie that inspired Edgar Wrights ""Dont"" trailer in Grindhouse. But Alvarez just keeps on amplifying the gory intensity until the film becomes absurd and weirdly infectious an exercise in seeing how far the audience will bend without breaking. Only the flexible need apply. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Trance Next Movie Review No Place On Earth Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

(Sony) B+ Evil Dead Genre Horror; Starring Shiloh Fernandez Jane Levy; Director Fede Alvarez; Release Date Wide 04/05/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 90; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted April 18 2013 -- 1200 AM EDT In the years since its 1981 release Sam Raimis cabin-in-the-woods cheapie The Evil Dead has been elevated to the realm of myth. You wont find many films as near and dear to the hearts of horror nerds. The legacy isnt based on the fact that The Evil Dead had a great screenplay because it didnt. In fact the plot is as basic as they come Five college students drive out to a shack in the middle of nowhere mess with an old reel-to-reel tape recorder that plays malevolent incantations and unleash bloody Lovecraftian hell. The films effects were cut-rate even for the early 80s and the acting (other than a charismatic breakout turn by lantern-jawed B-movie icon Bruce Campbell) was amateurish at best. What made it a fright flick for the ages was its 22-year-old wunderkind directors dime-store ingenuity and gonzo wit. Raimi jerry-rigged cameras onto two-by-fours and whipped them around like Orson Welles on speed. His off-kilter angles gave the movie a weird anxious energy. It was an eye-popping debut...and a hard act for anyone to follow. A certain subset of genre purists and Fangoria subscribers already have their knives out for the remake. But they can put them away. The new Evil Dead is not only made with an affectionate nod and a wink to the 1981 version its also the bloodiest goriest slapstickiest horror movie since well The Evil Dead. Directed with gutsy promise by newcomer Fede Alvarez (and produced and thus blessed by Raimi and Campbell themselves) the update doesnt mess with the originals bare-bones formula too much. It barrels right into the familiar story placing five old pals in a run-down cabin having them discover an old book filled with demonic illustrations and harrowing warnings and once again releasing the gruesome genie from the bottle. Other than Suburgatorys Jane Levy the cast isnt weighed down by too many familiar faces which seems right since these are pretty much interchangeable folks lining up for the body count. And what a juicy splattery body count it is. In Evil Dead blood sprays in arterial geysers like the fountains outside the Bellagio in Vegas. One possessed character licks a box cutter butterflying her tongue in half. Another has rats pouring out of her mouth like clowns piling out of a VW Bug. Eyes are stabbed with hypodermic needles limbs are severed with electric carving knives and chain saws do what chain saws do. Did I mention its a comedy? Some will have a hard time seeing it that way I know. The audience I saw it with screamed gasped and buried their faces in their dates necks. But horror films and TV shows such as The Walking Dead are like a foreign language. Either they speak to you or they dont. The new Evil Deads delirious gross-out scenes spoke to me and they go further than any mainstream picture I can think of. How a movie this graphic and gooey managed to finagle an R rating is a mystery. But Im not complaining. As a diehard fan of the original and the genre who am I to look such a wonderfully stomach-turning gift horse in the mouth?

Even with all of that cultural baggage however ""Evil Dead"" (which Raimi co-executive-produced) pours on the scares as thickly as it pours on the fake blood and theres definitely a plethora of both. This isnt just the scariest movie in recent memory its also the most viscous. Mia (Jane Levy playing a character as far removed from the snarky lead of ""Suburgatory"" imaginable) has come to her familys remote um house in the forest in an attempt to detox from drugs and go cold turkey. Helping her in her cause are childhood friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas) -- who have seen Mia fail in previous attempts at sobriety -- and Mias estranged brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore). The phrase ""battling her demons"" becomes literal when schoolteacher Eric cant stop himself from opening and reading a creepy flesh-bound book they discovered in the basement (alongside a bunch of dead cats) and as any horror movie fan knows once you start incantating from tomes best left unopened all hell literally breaks loose. (And thanks to the flooded roads trapping them our heroes are soon battling hell and high water.) First Mia gets possessed (and sexually assaulted by the underbrush) twitching and wreaking havoc on her friends who mistakenly think shes just battling the DTs. But the soul sickness starts spreading and then the self-mutilation (and attempted mutilation of others) begins and the nail guns come out and before long its a free-for-all of gore and thrills. And thrilling and gory ""Evil Dead"" is from a prologue that hints at just how dangerous that book is all the way through to its literally blood-soaked climax. Alvarez (who co-wrote with Rodo Sayagues) doesnt just drown us in Karo syrup however -- one of the films most frightening sequences involves a sharp object and a tender portion of the anatomy and while we cant see whats happening the sounds of it are absolutely horrifying. Whatever the foley artists scraped and squished together for that scene its disgustingly effective. Alvarez also offers up an interesting visual palette with the colors getting more and more desaturated along the way until we reach the ending where red suddenly plays a key role. This ""Evil Dead"" doesnt traffic in the wit that Raimis original trilogy delivered and the characters dont pop in the same way. (Theyre not even as vivid as the ones in ""The Cabin in the Woods."") Still Pucci and especially Levy create compelling conflicted young people who arent just meat puppets. If theres a disappointment factor in ""Evil Dead"" it comes at the climax which features too many endings and too much backtracking on the previously laid down rules of the story. It hints at going to darker places than it ultimately dares traverse. Still if youre looking for a movie that will make you hide your eyes and make embarrassing noises and toss your popcorn and cower in your dates lap ""Evil Dead"" churns out the terror.

Cue an invisible demon that uses tree limbs to rape and thereby possess Mia (Jane Levy) who returns to the cabin eager to slice and dice her friends as well as her brother (Shiloh Fernandez). In a virtuoso feature debut Uruguayan-born writer-director Fede Alvarez and co-writer Rodo Sayagues honor the motifs of the original from the camera rushing pell-mell through the woods to signal the demons arrival to the deployment of a chainsaw in the final showdown. But the plotting as a whole feels fresh as does the emphasis on women strong enough to defend themselves. Alvarez also honors Raimi who co-produced this remake in another key way The films special effects are created with old-fashioned prosthetics and buckets of blood which lend a horrifically tactile reality to such moments as when the possessed Mia slices her own tongue in two.

Buried in the cobweb-strewn skinned-cat-bedecked basement of a cabin in the woods is the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis--an ancient tome that unleashes literal Hell when someone speaks the demonic words within. Unfortunately for the human race (but fortunately for Beelzebub) a group of friends has gathered at this remote locale to help hophead Mia (Jane Levy) kick her drug habit. Withdrawals gonna be a bitch but its a cakewalk compared to whats in store when the hellion known as the Abomination is loosed. Fire-and-brimstone teaser sequence notwithstanding Fede Alvarezs slick hard-R remake of the 1981 cult horror hit by Sam Raimi takes its sweet tedious time getting going. Mias addiction is a calculated narrative ploy to keep the fresh-faced quintet isolated until the bloody stuff begins; not once are you invested in her plight or in her tortured relationship with her estranged brother (Shiloh Fernandez). What really matters is seeing these pretty people get put through the gory wringer and once the unholy spirit comes calling Evil Dead more than delivers Blood piss and vomit flow copiously; bodies get hacked with electric slicers and chainsaws; our possessed antiheroine even does the Showgirls pole lick on the sharp side of an X-Acto knife. The sanguine showstoppers are almost enough to distract you from the fact that the movie is so interested in serving the ED fan base--that pandering postcredits cameo is especially ungroovy--that it never carves out a distinct identity all its own.

AUSTIN -- ""Blood-drenched"" barely begins to describe Fede Alvarezs remake of Evil Dead a gore-for-broke affair that strips the flesh off Sam Raimis cult-beloved comic-horror franchise and exposes the demons at its core. The presence of Raimi original collaborator Rob Tapert and star Bruce Campbell as producers should give the faithful permission to attend what would otherwise smell like a shameless exploitation of the 1981 film but the high production values and nonstop action offered here should also please younger genre fans whove never bothered to rent it. SXSW Evil Dead Rises and the Crowd Goes Wild True to the essence of its predecessor but reinventing some particulars (precedent is set by Raimis Evil Dead II which practically remade the story from scratch) this film retains the five-youths-in-a-cabin premise but renames the characters and changes some relationships to ensure we dont expect a beat-by-beat remake. Thats good news for Shiloh Fernandez who has none of the humor or panache of Campbell -- Fernandezs David fills the slot of Campbells Ash in that hes the brother of the first young woman to be possessed by evil forces (Jane Levys Mia) but David is wisely never offered as an Ash-like hero. And while the original had a conventional slasher-flick set-up -- a co-ed spring break trip to the woods -- this one offers more justification for the remote setting and the characters reluctance to leave when things start to go south Mia is a drug addict and her brother and their friends have come to the family cabin to nurse her through a cold-turkey withdrawal. Having already steeled themselves to ignore her inevitable pleas to go home Mias friends at first mistake the evidence of her possession for drug-sick desperation. Not that this misinterpretation can last for long -- what with Mias flesh bubbling up into a scarier version of Linda Blairs Exorcist visage and her new habit of trying to kill her pals and spouting demon-voiced promises that none will live until dawn its pretty clear heroin isnt her only problem. Lou Taylor Puccis Eric having discovered a mysterious book full of supernatural lore -- fans recognize it as the Necronomicon bound in human skin and full of ""never repeat these magic words""-type warnings destined to be ignored -- diagnoses Mias condition after having unwittingly (read stupidly) set demons loose in the first place. But hes too late to keep her from biting some of their friends allowing spirits to overtake them as well. (The distinction between zombie-style biological infection and demonic possession was always a little hazy in Raimis series.) VIDEO Evil Dead Trailer Is Bloody Bloody Mayhem Pucci is this Evil Deads most charismatic cast member but Alvarez and his co-writer Rodo Sayagues give him only one wisecrack in the whole film. Jokes are almost non-existent here; Alvarez comes closest to trying to make us laugh (and it works) when his camera casually shows us a prop -- a shotgun a chainsaw -- whose importance we remember from Raimis trilogy. Instead he and his crack effects team work to make our stomachs turn. From the initial attack on Mia -- the infamous ""tree rape"" scene -- to the literal rainstorm of blood that accompanies the climax Evil Dead delivers satisfyingly disgusting effects that serve an ever-accelerating action pace. The only respite from the gore comes in those treacherous moments when one of the possessed stops spitting threats and blood to speak in the wounded innocent voice of the human who used to inhabit its body. The flip-flopping between ""why are you hurting me?"" and ""I will rape your soul in Hell"" is one of the original films gags -- like Raimis camera dodging trees as it offers a breakneck POV shot of demons swooping in to inhabit unwitting mortal shells -- that Alvarez executes perfectly in this unasked-for but entirely welcome remake.

First-time feature helmer Fede Alvarezs blood-soaked reprise of Sam Raimis franchise-spawning low-budget shocker ""The Evil Dead"" boasts far better production values than the penny-pinching 1981 original and conceivably could delight genre fans who have never seen the first version or its previous remakes/sequels. But its bound to play best with those who catch Alvarezs many wink-wink allusions to Raimis pic.SEE MORE Durban Film Festival Working from a script he co-wrote with Rodo Sayagues Alvarez briskly sets up his recycling of Raimis horror premise -- five friends visit a secluded cabin in the woods where all hell breaks loose -- with an aptly portentous prologue and backstory-heavy opening scenes. But Alvarez goes Raimi one better by actually offering a logical reason why the characters dont immediately vamoose once supernatural manifestations begin. Mia (Jane Levy) a drug-addicted young woman trying to go cold turkey is undergoing physically and psychologically agonizing withdrawal and her companions -- including prodigal brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and medically trained buddy Olivia (Jessica Lucas) -- are loath to interrupt the recovery process. Besides all those terrible things Mia claims to see are just hallucinations triggered by withdrawal right? Wrong. Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) the academically inclined member of the group finds in the cabin a mysterious Book of the Dead filled with horrific illustrations mysterious symbols and ample warnings not to read aloud anything that appears in its ancient pages. Unfortunately Eric does not heed those admonitions awakening a familiar demon for a new generation of young victims. Mia is the first to be infected by the monstrously malignant and singularly foul-mouthed bogeyman but it doesnt stop there inspiring her cabin mates to damage themselves and each other in creatively gory ways. Alvarez repeatedly references plot elements and specific shots from Raimis original pic. Taking his cue from the original he makes especially effective use of lenser Aaron Mortons swooping swirling camera movements which suggest the POV of a rampaging poltergeist. But Alvarezs tone is completely different as the helmer rarely attempts to emulate the self-mocking over-the-top campiness that distinguished the original ""Evil Dead"" from so many other cheapie creepies of the 1980s. Actor Bruce Campbell (whos onboard here as a producer) more or less established himself as a cult figure back in the day with his inspired overplaying of Ash the astonishingly resilient protagonist of Raimis original. In Alvarezs version Fernandezs David serves the equivalent role  but hes deadly serious. Indeed the only character who even gets to crack a joke is Puccis Eric. Asked if hes certain that actions described in the Book of the Dead will rid them of the troublesome spirit the frantic fellow replies ""Am I sure? Of course not Its not a science book"" Levy is believably beastly as the possessed Mia and manages the heavy lifting when her character must handle some last-act heroics. Other members of the cast do what they can with thinly written parts. For instance its not really Elizabeth Blackmores fault that her role as Davids g.f. is so ill-defined and unimportant that some may forget shes in the pic until she starts to make lethal use of a nail gun. The bloody mayhem is so graphic and frequent throughout ""Evil Dead"" one cannot help suspecting that alternate takes had to be shot to ensure an R rating. The emphasis on dismemberment and disfigurement should make this must-see entertainment for gorehounds but could literally scare off auds accustomed to less explicit PG-13 fare. Ultimately the new ""Evil Dead"" will rely heavily on existing fans of this unlikely franchise to make a killing in theatrical and homevid release. Those who get the inside jokes should be easy to spot Theyll be the ones laughing when the onscreen carnage erupts most furiously. Evil Dead Reviewed at SXSW Film Festival (Headliners) March 8 2013.

Michael Miller says March 17 2013 at 706 pm Although I thoroughly enjoyed reading your review of Evil Dead I had to point something out that has continued to get under my skin whenever I read anything about this rebirth of the horror classic the original Evil Dead along with the character of Ash WAS meant to be AND was completely serious Your comment in regards to the actor standing in for the Ash character (and Im paraphrasing) being deadly serious and the directors tone being different by not including the same over-the-top campiness and self mocking makes me seriously wonder if the reviewer even SAW the original. Because the original was NOT campy had VERY little humor and was deadly serious. It wasnt into Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn that the camp self mocking humor came to the forefront. The original however was completely serious and intense horror. Reply David May says March 24 2013 at 1006 am I completely agree with Michael Millers reply obviously the reviewer only watched the ED2 because ED1 was dead on serious. This is lazy reviewing at its worst I really doubt J. Leydon even watched ED1 there is so written about already you could just cliffnote the first two. Lazy in a economy where unemployment has been increasing for 3 years people would cut off there finget to get a great job like yours. Obviously horror is below you and probably had more important things to attend but a horror reviewer you are lazy and ignorant of what you write. I could care less if you hate it just give me a honest review of what you thought. I give this review one star for being so bad its funny I just dont think thats what was intended. Reply Gavin says March 29 2013 at 836 pm The first Evil Dead was campy over the top and funny. Evil Dead 2 was just more obviously so. Joe Leydon says March 27 2013 at 1031 am Must admit When I saw the first EVIL DEAD at a midnight screening the audience laughed constantly at what unfolded on screen. Indeed some folks were shouting encouraging comments while others shouted rude remarks. Cant say I didnt join in the fun. Howdy Jones says March 10 2013 at 1256 pm Yeah this review has me hugely anticipating the remake of EVIL DEAD. Hope it becomes a colossal success if only to turn the horror genre away from pandering to insipid teenage American girls and get the studios greenlighting seriously violently visceral pics again. So tired by the trite Chad amp; Carey Hayes cum James Wan PG-13 genre bores infesting multiplexes currently. Reply Justin says March 10 2013 at 1217 pm PLEASE post this review up on Rotten Tomatoes (Flixster) to help it out Loved the review.

The downright gnarliest mainstream horror release in recent memory ""Evil Dead"" is certainly a considerable and occasionally commendable dose of the ol ultra-violence but Fede Alvarez Raimi-sanctioned update of 1981s cult favorite only really has that demented determination going for it. Mia (Jane Levy) encourages two friends -- pre-med Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and high school teacher Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) -- to accompany her out to her familys cabin deep in the woods as she tries once more to kick her drug habit. Mias big brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) also shows up with girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) in tow and while the siblings try to put aside their recent estrangement Mias friends want to ensure that her cold turkey routine sticks this time. Of course once certain teachers get the bright idea to read aloud from a certain book of the dead recovered from the basement Mia soon finds herself tormented and possessed by a demon whose erratic behavior her pals initially mistake for withdrawal-related crankiness. The overhead shot of a flesh-bound book carefully placed on a table beside a shotgun and its shells has all the markings of a hellish-weekend starter kit and the fact that the book itself is wrapped in both garbage bags and barbed wire to keep away the curious serves as an apt metaphor for this new take one which manages to be both plastic and sharp. The first feature from director/co-writer Alvarez always takes careful care in framing carnage and casting shadows with an unflinching nigh fetishistic eye and the result is as slick as the first film was scrappy emphasizing sheer audacity over spirited anarchy. With that in mind said mayhem is indeed sickening stuff an effective union of digital and (more commonly) practical gore effects with a particularly juicy sound mix delivered at a relentless pace and the fourth act () is somehow still a doozy despite the preceding parade of horrors. (FYI stay after the credits.) The re-established mythos may adhere to tidy symptoms and solutions for our characters demonic dilemmas but hey its just nice to see some kids actually take the time to read a book these days. (It should be pointed out that there isnt a cell phone or any excuse for poor service in sight a cliche refreshingly dodged via simple omission. Even the cars are just not-modern enough to suggest a time between now and the originals era although none are as dated as Sam Raimis precious Oldsmobile making its requisite appearance here.) Levy and Fernandez are given much of what passes for heavy lifting with their strained relationship; every other character is in turn defined by Mias literalized junkie demons and their futile efforts to help but not by much else. Given the climaxs unexaggerated torrent of blood and the films generally proud sense of punishment its hard to imagine that the audience isnt tweaking for their fix of the red stuff more than any character on-screen is. To echo the sensationalist sales pitch of the original (""The ultimate experience in grueling terror"") this team has decided to run with the tagline ""The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience."" For all its gruesomeness theres little here that actually terrifies but lets face it ""Modern Horror at Its Most Devoutly Masochistic"" just isnt quite as catchy.

Respectably enough with his snazzy redressing of the first movie director Fede Alvarez doesnt even try. Instead ""Evil Dead"" a studio-produced take on the demon possession mayhem at a now-iconic cabin in the woods delivers a slick and undeniably wild ride by repurposing the original premise in body horror terms. With simpler aims and oodles of blood the new movie is a watered down scare-fest that works in spite of its formula by constantly frightening audiences into submission. Co-produced by original ""Evil Dead"" auteur Sam Raimi his producer Robert G. Tapert and cult star Bruce Campbell ""Evil Dead"" takes the material that Raimi initially used as an excuse for filmmaking trickery at face value. In a grisly prologue a possessed young woman is put out of her misery by her weeping father while an eerie shaman chants nearby. Unlike the original movies theres no ambiguity about the direction Alvarez is heading when in some vague period of time later a group of five young friends hole up in the aforementioned cabin and one of them comes across the foreboding Book of the Dead a graphically illustrated tome containing ominous conjuring spells hes not supposed to read (but naturally does because why not). Cue the similarly iconic swirling-camera-through-the-woods POV shot as a dreaded force makes its way toward one helpless character turning her into a furious monstrosity eager to nab each of the cabin dwellers souls which she proceeds to do in a series of grotesque assaults. This scenario is somewhat flimsily positioned in the context of an addiction story with coke fiend Mia (Jane Levy) escorted to the remote forest setting by friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas) Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) in a desperate attempt to get their pal to clean up her act. Theyre accompanied by Mias brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) returning to his siblings life after a lengthy absence that found him leaving Mia to take care of their dying mother alone. Just as Mia and David make an effort to get along old wounds are reopened -- literally of course as Mia encounters a ghastly presence in the woods that uses her to gradually infect and destroy the rest of her friends. Supposedly co-written by Diablo Cody (though her name doesnt appear in the credits) the half-baked screenplay finds Codys penchant for witty asides tamped down in favor of pure shock tactics most of which are rote sudden projectile blood vomit here unexpectedly ghastly reflection jarring an infected character there (the only real joke involves Puccis beleaguered Eric who endures virtually every possible attack imaginable and somehow keeps breathing). Alvarez relies on the its-right-behind-you tactic so many times you start holding your breath in virtually every scene while anticipating the next jump scare but the movie works better when it turns up the gore showing off a rare attentiveness to utterly grotesque production values. The rash of maiming and skin piercing that takes place in this movie unfolds at a breakneck pace so extreme that at times it gives you an idea of what it might look like if John Woo directed torture porn. At the movies SXSW world premiere audiences yelped with a mixture of excitement and disgust at these throwaway gags demonstrating just how well positioned they have been ahead of everything else. It would be easy to yawn away these ingredients were they not so relentlessly nerve-rackingly effective. Theres certainly a sense of play at work in ""Evil Dead"" which slyly inverts some aspects of gender expectations established in the original movies and Alvarez dutifully pays subtle homage to Raimis work through a handful of signposts (including yes a chainsaw). Yet no matter how freaky it gets ""Evil Dead"" displays a coyness when it comes to stylistic innovation. The involvement of the team behind the original movies may imply a desire on their part to explore the earlier movies ideas on a commercial scale not available to them at the time but it also proves they never needed it in the first place. An ode to the strength of onscreen horror even in its less inspired state the new ""Evil Dead"" primarily succeeds at illustrating how the originals have managed to stand the test of time. Criticwire grade B- HOW WILL IT PLAY? Sony plans to release ""Evil Dead"" on April 5 when it seems well positioned to dominate the box office a month of ahead of summer blockbuster season. The enthusiasm from SXSW may help kick off solid word of mouth but this movie more or less sells itself with the trailer.

General sites (Underwire Collider) seem positive. Shock Fango and 1 review on BD are medium. Some are ecstatic (BD AICN). Interestingly The Playlist has 2 notes both for fans(D)/non-fans(C) of the original... Obviously the ""fan/non-fan"" issue is interesting (even more so here); Horror cant be the same now that its once again a box-office contender and all over the media (internet TV) reaching more people. Whats weird is that reviews like Colliders end up saying its not an innovative flick but an OK remake while still giving it a B. Underwire almost go as far as saying that the original wasnt that great anyway (almost). Thus they seem to agree with the newest horror audience (""fans"" as much as any); though Id say the frequent use of ""as long as its gore who cares"" by the latest against so called hardcore-fans doesnt really make sense to me. Again especially when most point-out the lack of innovation/ambition above all (but the ""humor"" debate seems to draw most of the attention). Turns out it seems to be the same movie with more money. Maybe genre implies generic but not the absence of standards (for lack of a better word) right? What Im trying to compute is that its funny really the price to pay for being almost mainstream Horror is treated much like comedy not a genre per se. Reply tom May 12 2016 219 pm Cloud pleaser.
