As a study in the social psychological and philosophical dimensions of hypocrisy and intolerance it pounds home its somewhat obvious points. As an exercise in Brechtian distanciation - theres a narration with echoes of Thornton Wilder beautifully intoned by John Hurt and its all shot in a studio empty of everything except a few basic props - its gimmicky and never brought to a fruitful conclusion. And as drama its repetitive and overlong. That said the performances are strong and the final scene with its Capone the Father and Christ the Daughter associations equating the Land of Freedom with Sodom and Gomorrah has an infectiously wicked glee that almost redeems the preceding portentousness.

"Danish Cinema Cuts to the Chaste washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Danish Cinema Cuts to the Chaste Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Sunday January 11 2004 Denmarks self-appointed cinematic bad boy is at it again. Lars von Trier made a splash -- when does he not set out to make a splash? -- at the Cannes Film Festival last year when he presented his latest release ""Dogville."" The film -- not so much a film as one of his signature provocations really -- features a quality ensemble cast (Lauren Bacall Ben Gazzara James Caan Paul Bettany Philip Baker Hall Nicole Kidman) in an often fascinating just as often confounding cinematic experiment. Eschewing conventional locations and sets von Trier filmed ""Dogville"" on a bare stage indicating sets and some props with chalk outlines. The story a Depression-era parable about a beautiful drifter named Grace (Kidman) whose arrival in a Colorado mining town sets off an escalating series of moral crises is related in a highly pitched theatrical style combining the pastoral intimacy of ""Our Town"" with the bold confrontational aesthetic of a Brecht play. ""Dogville"" will be shown today at the National Gallery of Art as part of a two-month series of Danish films at the museum. (The film will arrive at local theaters in the spring.) ""Dogville"" represents the latest of von Triers dialogues with American history and Hollywood film genre. In 1996 he made his version of a 1950s-type melodrama with ""Breaking the Waves""; two years ago he made ""Dancer in the Dark"" a decidedly personal take on the MGM musical. Aside from a brief burst of film noir gunfire in ""Dogville"" von Trier doesnt quote filmmakers as much as other American artists His staging -- not to mention his concern with bourgeois moral hypocrisy -- is straight out of the WPA-era theater; his characters might have been photographed by Walker Evans for ""Let Us Now Praise Famous Men""; his camera style which favors close-ups and searingly long quiet takes owes more to such live television shows as ""Playhouse 90"" than to feature films. Yet ""Dogville"" also perpetuates some of von Triers cardinal obsessions (and limitations). For example as in nearly every one of his other films in ""Dogville"" he seems to take an almost sadistic delight in torturing his lead female both as a character and as an actress. Here Grace and Kidman are put through their paces with the leering cruelty of a malign ringmaster Grace starts out as a strong morally centered protagonist and is rewarded for her lack of guile by being collared like a dog then chained to a huge wheel which she drags across the stage in martyred lurches. For all of ""Dogvilles"" strengths -- its powerful performances the ingenious staging how quickly and completely the audience accepts its stylized reality -- its take-home message is ultimately measly. And this is where von Triers limitations come in. As in so many of his previous films the director goes to outlandish often shamelessly manipulative lengths to inform viewers of a simplistic truth they didnt exactly need to be reminded of in the first place -- in this case that greed dishonesty and pious self-deception are bad bad bad. The critic David Thomson might have put it most succinctly in his Autobiographical Dictionary of Film when he wrote of von Trier ""He has wanton skills a greedy eye and a taste for lush morbidity."" The result Thomson concludes is ""a lesson in how hollow aesthetic virtuosity can be."" In fact over a 20-year career von Trier (he added the ""von"" by the way while he was in film school) has emerged less as a filmmaker than as a consummate and canny showman. In 1993 he formed Zentropa Entertainments a production company that has since made more than 100 films music videos and TV shows. Most famously in 1995 von Trier and his contemporaries formed Dogme 95 a consortium of filmmakers who agreed to make movies with no artificial lighting or scenery no musical score only hand-held cameras and no authorial credit for the director. Dogmes manifesto often called the ""Vows of Chastity"" received immediate publicity along with a hue and cry from filmmakers and filmgoers alike. (At this juncture Thomson was impelled to write that in forming Dogme von Trier ""added bogusness to his vulgarity."") The proof was in the plodding Although there have been a few genuinely absorbing and entertaining Dogme movies (""The Celebration"" and ""Italian for Beginners"" leap to mind) most of them including von Triers own tiresome exercise ""The Idiots"" have been little more than pretentious self-conscious film-school essays that have received publicity not because of any inherent interest or artistry but because their directors have usually accompanied their releases with tortured mea culpas about the vows that they broke such as pulling back a curtain to increase a rooms light. Von Trier and Co. have always had their tongues firmly situated in their cheeks of course Dogme 95 was only a hip young Danish form of old-fashioned ballyhoo (or as the director John Waters has often been heard to crack ""Before Dogme 95 when was the last time you heard anyone talking about Danish cinema?""). Thats precisely the question the National Gallery has set out to answer. Subtitled ""The Golden Age Returns"" its five-week series of Danish films seeks to remind viewers that von Trier and such similarly celebrated contemporaries as Per Fly (""The Inheritance"") Jorgen Leth (""New Scenes From America"") Jesper Jargil (""The Humiliated"") and Soren Kragh-Jacobsen (""Mifune"") are simply a new incarnation of a hugely influential national cinematic tradition both aesthetically and commercially. Whereas the first four weeks of the series will feature new and recent work by Danish directors the last will be devoted to their forebears the filmmakers of Denmarks silent era of the 1910s and 20s who together built a muscular indigenous film industry (Nordisk Film the Danish company founded in 1906 is the oldest continuously running studio in the world). ""The Golden Age Returns"" will feature some rarely seen gems among them August Bloms ""Temptations of a Great City"" (1910) and Carl-Theodor Dreyers ""Once Upon a Time"" a restored print of a 1922 film that was lost in the Nordisk archive until 1964. In Bloms work especially it becomes evident that von Trier is by no means the first bad boy of Danish cinema. In ""The White Slave"" (1910) and ""The Four Devils"" (1911) Blom engages in the sort of sensationalism and formal daring for which Danish cinema was famous -- or notorious -- in the new 20th century. As its title suggests ""The White Slave"" features a woman in jeopardy kidnapped by miscreants who subject her to more perils than Pauline all bearing just a slight whiff of perversion; ""The Four Devils"" is a story about children abducted by a circus trapeze artist who grooms them to be a famous high-wire act. Breathtaking stunts ill-fated love and tragedy ensue. Indeed it was common during this first golden age in Denmark for filmmakers to make films ripped from the headlines confronting -- or perhaps more accurately titillating -- audiences with crime sexuality and human vice that make the Dogme films look tame. Von Trier and his contemporaries can be congratulated for putting Danish cinema back on the map; with the generosity of Denmarks government a national film school and the activist enterprising spirit of the Danish Film Institute they have succeeded in creating one of the few European film cultures that can stand up against the hegemony of Hollywood. Nordisk lives So does Zentropa In your face Disney But for all the commercial traction theyve managed to gain both at home and internationally whether these new artists truly live up to the golden age of the silents is up to audiences who sadly will see more of the former than the latter at the National Gallery over the next several weeks. Still with luck the series will help put the newbies ""radical"" innovations in proper context. Perhaps best to defer once more to Thomson who broke into unbridled chuckles recently when asked to consider the frequent comparisons of Dreyer and von Trier. ""Carl Dreyer was a really great director"" he said simply. ""And von Trier is a really bad one."" Dogville (177 minutes rated R for violence and sexual content) will be shown today at 430 p.m. at the National Gallery of Arts East Building Auditorium Fourth Street and Constitution Avenue NW. Admission is free and seating is on a first-come basis. For more information call 202-842-6799 or visit www.nga.gov.

"The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues | | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Observer Music The Disrespected Arts Journalist Blues By Justin Joffe  07/29/16 324pm Patron saint of schlubby music journalists Lester Bangs. More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Its a punishing film to sit through and its rewards may well depend on how much credit you wish to give von Trier for doing something different. Because for better or worse ""Dogville"" is unlike anything else youll see on screens this year. But its very much like several of von Triers previous films in one particular aspect the prolonged humiliation of its heroine. (The bad-boy Danish director has been making films for 20 years including a lengthy involvement with the Dogme 95 movement which railed against artificiality in film.) Nicole Kidman here becomes the latest in von Triers line of shining-eyed victimized waifs behind Emily Watson in ""Breaking the Waves"" and Bjork in ""Dancer in the Dark."" As Grace a fugitive who arrives in the small Rocky Mountain town of Dogville Kidman is repeatedly raped made to wear a metal dog collar (attached to a heavy wheel to keep her captive) and subjected to other abuses. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Dogville"" with Nicole Kidman Paul Bettany Ben Gazzara James Caan Chloe Sevigny Lauren Bacall Patricia Clarkson Jeremy Davies John Hurt Stellan Skarsgard. Written and directed by Lars von Trier. 177 minutes. Rated R for violence and sexual content. Harvard Exit. All this is in service to a ponderous plot that ultimately seems to be making a statement about the dehumanizing soul-deadening effects of poverty and the cruelty that an insulated community can inflict on an outsider. But any possible message (though pounded home with a deafening thud over the end credits -- a montage of photographs of impoverished men women and children accompanied by David Bowies ""Young Americans"") gets lost in the sheer tedium of the filmmaking as do the valiant efforts of many of the actors. (In the large supporting cast Paul Bettany Lauren Bacall and Patricia Clarkson have some vivid moments; some other cast members seem to be sleepwalking their way through the film -- or have been directed that way.) Stylistically ""Dogville"" resembles nothing so much as Thornton Wilders ""Our Town"" gone berserk. Its performed on a bare set with chalk-mark outlines to indicate walls and streets and the actors must go through elaborate pantomime when opening and shutting doors that arent there. Costumes indicate the Depression era but few props are used. John Hurt speaking in the unhurried and ever-so-slightly condescending tones of a bored university lecturer serves as narrator introducing us to Dogville and its citizens who first greet Grace with wary acceptance but eventually turn on her. Unfolding in nine chapters and a prologue ""Dogville"" tells its tale over three very long lugubrious hours accompanied by a score that sounds right out of ""Masterpiece Theatre."" But there isnt much to tell and the stylistic innovations wear thin quickly -- Dogville the town looks like a very odd board game. And as Grace is increasingly punished so are we; theres little humanity on display here either toward the characters or toward the audience. What remains in the memory afterward -- other than a nagging sense that perhaps time had stood still -- are a few undeniably lovely shots (in one of several filmed from overhead milkweed floats gently through the air like snow) and an achingly vulnerable performance by Kidman. She uses a tiny whispery voice that gets more raspy as the drama drags on; her kitty-cat beauty here has a ravaged quality to it. As she glides through the quiet streets almost shrinking inside her long fur-collared black coat shes this haunted towns regal ghost. By the end as Grace is transformed you believe that shes been through an ordeal. Unfortunately so have we.

Starring Nicole Kidman Paul Bettany Lauren Bacall and Patricia Clarkson. Directed by Lars von Trier. (R. 177 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The best way to see ""Dogville"" is to know nothing about it but to trust it and have faith that it will deliver. At 177 minutes the film is slow to start -- or so it seems -- going along for nearly an hour before it even hints that it will be anything more than an innocuous parable. In fact the groundwork is being set for a movie thats anything but innocuous but instead is mischievous singular and profound. So stop reading. Still there? Then lets talk but not too much about the story and nothing at all about the ending but about the nature of ""Dogville"" as a film and an experience. In all my years of moviegoing Ive never had a picture lose me so completely and then win me back so thoroughly as this one. After a half hour I was tired of it. After nearly an hour I was struggling to stay awake. And then the movie took a slight turn and I revived then became interested then involved then caught up emotionally and then finally awestruck. This is a seriously important film and a huge achievement. Written and directed by the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier (""Breaking the Waves"" ""Dancer in the Dark"") ""Dogville"" has lots to say about human nature in general and provincialism in particular. But the movies special target is without question the United States. Beneath its surface of Scandinavian serenity this is an angry film not a concerned one not a reproving one but one thats boiling mad. Yet for all of von Triers rage at us his criticisms arent scattershot. His observations are pointed and intelligent. ""Dogville"" takes place in a small town in the Rocky Mountains during the nadir of the Great Depression but there are no mountain vistas. The film is shot entirely on an empty soundstage with chalk outlines standing in for houses streets and trees. Throughout the actors mime knocking on doors and opening them and this fey conceit takes a few minutes of getting used to. But gradually the movies barren look becomes an advantage. Von Trier is not interested in portraying the boundlessness of the environment but the characters insularity and lack of imagination. Their world might as well be flat and surrounded by darkness. Von Trier makes that literal. The denizens of Dogville are played by an international cast of famous names and faces -- Lauren Bacall and Harriet Andersson as shopkeepers Ben Gazzara as a blind man Blair Brown and Patricia Clarkson as housewives Chloe Sevigny as the local heartthrob -- with John Hurt as an unseen British narrator who sets each of the films nine scenes in a voice dripping with false kindness. Paul Bettany has the pivotal role of Tom Edison Jr. not the son of the inventor but a sensitive young man who dreams of becoming a great writer. One night gunshots are heard and Grace (Nicole Kidman) enters fleeing from gangsters. Tom hides her and persuades his fellow townspeople to let her stay. In return she starts doing little chores for everyone keeping to a regular schedule. She weeds for Ma Ginger (Bacall) helps Chuck (Stellan Skarsgard) with his trees baby-sits for Vera (Clarkson) and keeps Old Mr. Mackay (Gazzara) company. Gradually she makes herself indispensable. But the towns enthusiasm for harboring Grace is diminished when the sheriff shows up one day with a wanted poster for Graces arrest. Though shes wanted for a crime that everyone knows she couldnt have committed -- Grace was with them in Dogville at the time -- Mrs. Henson (Blair Brown) still wonders if they have a legal obligation to report her anyway. This is the films first faint dark turn. Others darker will follow. Von Trier has never been to America and for this he has been criticized. If he visited hed probably find a lot to like. Yet though armed with only secondhand knowledge he still portrays and elucidates a peculiarly American strain of human pathology. He shows people aligning themselves with authority in order to disguise their own vindictiveness even from themselves. He shows poverty-stricken citizens identifying with wealth not each other. Most tellingly he shows people with absolute unshakable faith in their own rectitude using that faith not as a springboard for good works but as a license to commit grossly immoral acts. Theres power in this -- not in the statement not in the allegory but just in the human terms of the story. Kidmans performance is affecting in its simplicity a portrait in muted colors that conveys Graces near-saintliness with an offhand air. She doesnt express outrage and so we feel it. Bettanys challenge is different to show us more of Tom than Tom sees in himself. And so we see the heroic impulse but also the small spirit the true honest yearning of the unevolved soul. Some have called ""Dogville"" a Christian allegory but even if it is symbols are easy. Its poetry thats hard. ""Dogville"" is poetry as strident and passionate in its outrage as Chaplins ""The Great Dictator"" and it may prove as lasting. -- Advisory This film contains violence and simulated sex.

Its part of their job description. What other trade compels a person to travel halfway around the world get up at 5 a.m. each day dress and talk funny gain or lose 40 lbs. and make simulated love or war with a near stranger? The decamillions that movie stars pull down may amount to combat pay. And if they do it for next to nothing -- well thats either noble or very ... weird. In these terms a Lars von Trier movie is a dream-nightmare come true. And Nicole Kidman who not only endured but also apparently savored her 17-month incarceration while making Stanley Kubricks Eyes Wide Shut is just the actress to see directorial fiat as a fast car worth strapping herself into. The result of this fascinating collision is Dogville for which the notoriously kooky Danish auteur lured a distinguished cast to Scandinavia (he refuses to fly) so they could pretend to be in an American town in the 1930s. Which town? Our Town. Von Trier asserts his intention to rethink the classic Thornton Wilder play with his films magnificent first shot an overhead view of a nearly bare stage set with Dogvilles properties and props designated by painted lines. The old mine down the road is identified by a sign reading OLD MINE. A townsman closes an invisible door and we hear a slamming noise. Von Trier presumably wants us to attend to his characters yearnings and prejudices without the distractions of period furnishings. Its a brilliant idea for about 10 minutes. Then the bare set is elbowed out of a viewers mind by the threadbare plot and characterizations. Into this town of ostensibly decent folk comes a fugitive named Grace (Kidman) a familiar Von Trier heroine-victim like the ones played by Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves and Bjork in Dancer in the Dark. Grace is the beneficiary of the townspeoples Christian charity then the victim of their envy malice lies and sadism. She stoically endures a spate of abuse nearly as long and relentless as Jesus in the Mel Gibson gospel. Her resurrection though takes a different darker turn. Incarnating amiability with an undercoat of evil can be a benison to an actor. Unfortunately for them Dogvilles old pros (including Lauren Bacall Ben Gazzara Harriet Andersson John Hurt Stellan Skarsgaard Patricia Clarkson and Blair Brown) have only attitudes not characters to play and these are as flat as the lines on the floor. Its not a pretty sight gifted actors with big ambitions and nothing purposeful to do. Only two things keep ones eyes on the screen the spectacle of the gorgeous Kidman soldiering on as Graces regality is defiled and the suspicion that this resourceful woman will find a way to revenge herself on the town without pity. And the director without humanity.

"Dogville | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dogville ) Dogville (Denmark/Sweden/Netherlands/France/Germany 2003) A movie review by James Berardinelli Warning Significant spoilers starting in Paragraph 4. (But in a case like this do plot details really matter?) Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier has gone from Dogma to Dogville. The directors latest a three-hour political allegory has fueled controversy world-wide. This is of course von Triers intention since his ego needs this kind of attention to remain in its bloated state. Nevertheless although the movies self-importance causes the project to take on water it fails to sink it. Dogville isnt for everyone but theres some intellectually stimulating conversation fodder for those with the patience to navigate the films rough terrain. I admit to being conflicted about Dogville. On balance I think the pluses outweigh the minuses but its a close call. This is a deeply flawed motion picture that in spite of its problems manages to be engrossing at times and leaves a lasting albeit disturbing impression. Film critic Nathan Lerner referred to it as equally ""brilliant"" and ""unsettling"" and I think he has it right. If you attend movies exclusively for their entertainment value theres nothing here. But if youre looking for something to inspire thought and conversation Dogville is a solid choice. The story is simple enough because there isnt one of substance. This is an obvious allegory (although its meaning is anything but ""obvious"") which allows the movie to resonate beyond whats taking place on the screen. Theres no real involvement with the characters or their situations because von Trier makes it clear from the beginning that hes not interested in presenting a reflection of any sort of ""reality."" There are moments when the actors are so good that we forget this and get a glimpse of an underlying humanity but those are fleeting instances. Dogville is a tiny town in the Colorado Rockies during the 1930s. The population is small consisting of 15 adults a few children and a dog. Into this settlement arrives Grace (Nicole Kidman) a beautiful woman being pursued by gangsters. One of the locals Tom Edison (Paul Bettany) is immediately infatuated with her and decides to act as her rescuer. He hides her from the gangsters and after they leave proposes that she join the community. For this to happen all 15 adults must approve her residency. She has two weeks to convince them that she will be a good citizen. She sets out to win them over including grumpy Ma Ginger (Lauren Bacall) blind Jack McKay (Ben Gazarra) unhappy Chuck (Stellan SkarsgAY=rd) and high-strung Vera (Patricia Clarkson). The first few months after Grace has joined the Dogville community are happy times. Then the police arrive looking for her. She has been framed by the gangsters and is wanted for several armed robberies. Now that she has become a fugitive from justice the townspeople see an opportunity to exploit her. Her working hours increase her pay is cut and the conditions under which she must toil become increasingly arduous. She is raped beaten and otherwise abused. An attempted escape fails and the people of Dogville make contact with the gangsters hoping they will take her away eliminating the problem. But when they arrive it is revealed that Grace is the daughter of the head mobster (James Caan). She uses the reunion with her father as an opportunity to exact retribution upon everyone who has mistreated her. The first thing to mention is von Triers stylistic approach. Although the movie does not follow the ascetic Dogma guidelines (it uses pre-recorded music for one thing) it in many ways takes a more bare-bones approach. The entire movie is presented as a set-less stage play. Instead of houses with walls and doors there are chalk lines on the ground. The name of the main thoroughfare (""Elm Street"") is written in block white letters where the pavement should be. When characters are intended to be opening doors the actors mime turning a door handle while a helpful sound effect is heard. Ostensibly von Triers intention is for the audience to focus on the acting and themes without being distracted by the setting but there are times when this minimalist approach is counterproductive. On more than one occasion scenes come close to self-parody; I was awaiting an appearance by a member of John Cleese Graham Chapman Michael Palin Eric Idol Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam. (At least the gangsters use real cars.) Dogville is von Trier at his best and his worst. Those who would argue that Dogville is a pretentious self-indulgent insufferably long motion picture have a case (a 215 director-approved cut exists but thats not the one being released in the United States). Likewise those who would argue that the movie offers a brutal uncompromising perspective of issues most movies avoid can also provide a persuasive argument. The reality is that Dogville encompasses both. Paradoxically its a compelling bore. What does it all mean? The film is cleverly developed so that there are at least two apparent interpretations. The strongest clues about which country the film is indicting come during the closing credits which show photographs from the Depression-era United States and use David Bowies ""Young American"" as an anthem. Those who believe von Trier is making a general statement about humanity or industrialized countries worldwide have stepped out before the end credits started rolling. The first interpretation uses standard socialist ideals. Grace represents the oppressed masses and the townspeople are those who exploit her. In the end she rises up against them. While this is a valid way to look at Dogville it seems almost too simplistic a message to be embraced by a director like von Trier. Thus the second interpretation may be closer to the directors intentions. In this scenario Grace represents North America. Early in history this continent and its resources were exploited by Europe. Now however in the wake of industrialization North America (and in particular the United States) has become the worlds dominant power and has used its superior technology to impose its will upon the world without consideration of justice. Thus the oppressed has become the oppressor with the tables being ruthlessly overturned. This fits the events that unfold in Dogville. Other viewers may see Dogville differently and therein lies its genius. It inspires thought and discussion and theres no right answer. One can engage in a verbal sparring match about what von Trier meant whether his skeletal approach to set design works and whether the plodding pace is necessary or a detriment. Start the conversation on the way out of the theater continue it at a nearby coffee shop and finish it on the drive home. As infuriating as von Trier can be (and his previous movies like Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark have their share of admirers and despisers) he knows how to be provocative. The cast is amazing with everyone giving a strong (if somewhat mannered) performance. In addition to Kidman who is superlative as Grace theres Paul Bettany as the ineffectual Tom Stellan SkarsAY=rd as the first man to take advantage of Graces position ChloA<< Sevigny as the towns lone sex object (before Graces arrival) and the legendary Lauren Bacall as a fatalistic femme. Other notables include Ben Gazarra Patricia Clarkson James Caan Philip Baker Hall and Jeremy Davies. John Hurt provides the narration using his British accent to drip acid from every word. Do I recommend the movie? Yes although with reservations. Like many films of this sort it can be difficult to sit through and demands an open mind. Those who approach it like this will discover that there are rewards to be unearthed. When its all over you may not like it but you also wont be able to shake it. Its the films tenacity and daring as much as anything else that earns it a favorable nod from this critic.

It is darkly funny intellectually challenging and obliquely didactic. It also grows bleaker over the course of its nearly three-hour running time. Dogvilles mayor (Paul Bettany) encourages the towns people to take in Nicole Kidmans character whos on the run from gangsters. Lions Gate Films But kudos to Danish director Lars Von Trier for attempting a thought-provoking film that is distinctly different from most screen fare. Dogville is the name of a village which actually is simply a set with no buildings. When people go in and out of ""houses"" the cue is the sound of a creaking door; there are no doors or walls. The towns only ""dog"" is a chalk outline with the word ""dog"" inside it. Still he can be heard barking whenever a stranger comes to town and it is a strangers arrival that kick-starts the action. Nicole Kidman is Grace a mysterious woman who is on the run from gangsters. Dogvilles de facto mayor is Tom (Paul Bettany) a liberal-minded writer (who has written only two words). He believes the town is staid and uncaring so when Grace arrives he tests his assessment by asking townsfolk to harbor her and give her work. They grudgingly agree and she initially wins them over with her good-heartedness and hard work. But eventually the villagers turn on her. ABOUT THE MOVIE Dogville    (out of four) Stars Nicole Kidman Paul Bettany Lauren Bacall Patricia Director Lars Von Trier Distributor Lions Gate Films Rating R for violence and sexual content Opens Friday in New York and Los Angeles Dogville symbolizes America; the film accuses the country of initially welcoming outsiders but ultimately exploiting them. Von Trier spares no punches showing the impotence of liberal Tom and the closed-minded cruelty of the conservative townsfolk. Kidman does a fine job as does Bettany. Among the villagers the standouts are Lauren Bacall as a cold-hearted shopkeeper Patricia Clarkson as a creepily indulgent mother with a monster for a child and Ben Gazzara as a blind man who wont face up to his blindness then uses it to take advantage of Grace. Its an intriguingly subversive tactic to employ Hollywood actors to make such an anti-American film. Von Triers sociopolitical statements are not subtle but they are artfully conveyed. The movie segues from a violent ending to documentary-style black-and-white photographs that show men women and children struggling with deprivation accompanied by the jarringly jaunty Young Americans by David Bowie. When was the last time a movie forced you to take stock of how our country is perceived from afar?

It is also not unlike a certain recent blockbuster a potent parable of human suffering the contagion of fear and how loath we truly are to love thy neighbor here unfolding amid the Great Depression in a fictitious Rocky Mountain town nestled somewhere near the intersection of Bertolt Brecht Avenue and High Noon Way. A town were told where ""good honest folk"" trudge forth through ""wicked times."" Just how wicked is something Trier holds close to the vest until we are well immersed in Dogvilles sprawling three-hour canvas. First though some introductions are in order. Say hello to shopkeepers Gloria (Harriet Andersson) and Ma Ginger (Lauren Bacall) whose highway-robbery prices take advantage of the fact that Dogville is -- or was -- a company town; to family farmer Chuck (Stellan Skarsgard) his wife Vera (Patricia Clarkson) and their brood of towheaded youngsters; to retired physician Tom Edison Sr. (Philip Baker Hall); and to Tom Edison Jr. (Paul Bettany) an aspiring author who has managed to date to set only two words to paper. Failing the appearance of his muse Tom in Dogvilles opening scenes sets about another no less inventive task that of leading a series of town meetings focused on the subject of ""moral rearmament."" He seeks to illustrate ""the human problem -- to receive"" and sooner rather than later a prime opportunity falls right into his lap. When an eruption of gunfire somewhere on the outskirts of Dogville heralds the arrival of a beautiful fugitive not coincidentally named Grace (Nicole Kidman) its Tom who talks Dogvilles proud River City types into protecting the poor girl from a bunch of shadowy gangsters in dark-tinted Cadillacs. Really he suggests they ought to give Grace a try. Thus things proceed for a good long while with Grace gradually becoming an indispensable part of the Dogville economy tending to all sorts of tasks -- baby-sitting tutoring visiting a reclusive bachelor (Ben Gazzara) too proud to admit hes blind -- which somehow prior to her arrival never needed tending to. But it is not so very long before she starts to see her adopted town in a new light one that casts its rays upon the hearts and minds of the denizens of Dogville illuminating every flaw. And it is not so very much later that Grace comes to understand the full meaning of Chucks ominous warning ""People are animals. Feed em enough and theyll eat till their bellies burst.""

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm In a series of developments that will hardly surprise those whove followed Triers recent work the film goes on to chart Graces exploitation by the residents of Dogville -- how she becomes a convenient scapegoat for their own moral shortcomings and a receptacle for their deep-seated bitterness toward one another. Similar fates you may recall befell Emily Watsons Bess in Breaking the Waves and Bjorks Selma in Dancer in the Dark. But if those characters suggested a distinctly Bressonian exploration of the self-sacrificing innocent Dogvilles ivory-skinned quietly aristocratic Grace seems less disposed to such immolations. And when you further consider that Trier has shot Dogville on a nearly naked sound stage constructed especially for the occasion with the entire town outlined in chalk on the floor and just a few props roughed in for effect you begin to see just how radical this movie really is. Radical I should add not so much in the sense of breaking new ground for in addition to the influence of Brecht (and in particular the ""Pirate Jenny"" ballad from The Threepenny Opera) Dogville certainly owes something to the work of a long line of theater-cinema hybridists from Jean Cocteau to Jean-Marie Straub. Rather the films revolutionary spirit derives from its effort -- the culmination of something Trier has been building toward since he first drew up the infamous Dogme 95 manifesto -- to reclaim a kind of pure cinema that has become largely obfuscated in an age that sees so much filmmaking ""craft"" available at the touch of a button. Which is to say a cinema capable of stirring in us the greatest and most tremulous of human emotions and a searching sense of our own foibles and shortcomings. And heres where we come to the thing that has really rubbed some folks the wrong way about Dogville ever since it premiered at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival that the film is set in America that it purports to have something to say about this country and that the notoriously travel-phobic Trier has had the gall to do this without ever once setting foot on ""our"" soil. Worse yet Dogville is but the first in a planned trilogy called ""USA -- Land of Opportunities"" the next installment of which Manderlay will reportedly follow the character of Grace to a small Southern town where slavery circa 1930 is still a living institution. But the perception of Dogville as armchair anti-Americanism stems from a fundamental misreading of the film one that allies Trier with abused victim Grace when its clear that his actual alter ego resides in demiurge Tom whos positioned like the ethereal Stage Manager from Wilders Our Town at once inside the action and somehow outside it trotting Dogvilles perilous high wire between intellectual curiosity and intellectual arrogance. A good way into the film Tom reveals to Grace that he has finally completed the first chapter of a story about a woman like her and a town like Dogville. He asks her to suggest a title. ""Why not just call it Dogville?"" she replies. ""No"" he says. ""Its got to be universal. A lot of writers make that mistake."" And so it is that Triers Dogville set in a country he knows only from movies and television becomes a cautionary confessional fable for all men in all seasons who would pursue art at the expense of compassion.   I could go on for Dogville has rarely been far from my mind in the 10 months following Cannes during which time it has grown only richer deeper and more complex than I initially estimated. Surely the extraordinary cast of characters Trier has sketched out and the equally estimable cast of performers he has enlisted to portray them deserve closer attention than Ive so far managed. In particular Bettany charming and demure the brightest kid in town and a blocked writer worthy of Jack Torrance; Skarsgard so earthen you may want to plant him; and Clarkson showing a vindictive menace (in one unforgettable scene) of which few would imagine her capable. Also not to be overlooked is the wide-screen digital-video cinematography of regular Trier collaborator Anthony Dod Mantle (though the camera was hand-held by the director himself) disinclined to obvious displays of beauty yet punctuated by overhead shots of the entire Dogville set that are as arresting as any of Breaking the Waves so-called ""post cards from God."" Then there is Kidman herself hush-voiced and glassy-eyed as if lost in a private dream unflinching from the various onscreen tortures she must endure and generally doing very little ""acting"" at all in her most impressive screen performance to date. But if a single moment stands out from the rest when I reflect back on my Dogville year its the screening of the film I attended two weeks ago in the company of several hundred other paying customers at the Florida Film Festival in Winter Park. Here was Dogville testing the waters of small-town America -- Trier territory if you will -- and moreover with a crowd of cinemagoers whose average age looked to be about 60. Had these people ever even heard of Trier? Or had Nicole Kidmans (and James Caans and Lauren Bacalls) name above the title been the draw? Im pleased if a bit surprised to report that when the lights dimmed and the film played out across the screen this crowd was really digging Dogville -- carried along by its sheer narrative force; laughing in all the right grimly funny places; and erupting when Kidman utters a valedictory catch phrase in one of the films final scenes into thunderous applause. That certainly didnt happen at Cannes (where Dogville arrived pre-sold as a front-runner and perhaps for that very reason went home empty-handed) or in all likelihood in the many other places around the world where Dogville has already had a commercial release to generally disappointing returns. But here in the very country this supposedly inscrutable art film supposedly gets all wrong with the sort of crowd that likely doesnt know that Dogme 95 isnt a station on the FM dial Dogville seemed to touch a nerve. What does that mean? Possibly that Trier doesnt know so very little about the land of the free -- and its moviegoers -- after all. And that maybe just maybe after two decades of art-house kudos amid relative commercial obscurity he finally has a hit on his hands.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.
