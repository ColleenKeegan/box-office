Rotund noodle-selling bear Po (voiced by Jack Black) discovers that he is the living embodiment of an ancient Shaolin legend which drives him to train as a martial arts expert and confront psychotic snow leopard Tai-Lung. Hes aided on his quest by crotchety Zen master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his menagerie of high-flying wire-fu legends the Furious Five.Theres no chop-socky cliche too hackneyed for the filmmakers to make meat of. Inscrutable riddle-spouting guru check. Ancient mystical jade temple check. Uptempo training montage check. The setting is a sort of Disneyland version of ancient China all fast-running waterfalls snapping chopsticks and spiralling bamboo parasols. The script is as thin as rice paper and the characters though likeable are simply too plentiful and too many of them feel short-changed. The ending was extensively rewritten and it shows limping to an underwhelming conclusion from which many of the best characters are inexplicably absent. But for all its faults theres something inescapably likeable about Kung-Fu Panda. Po is a winning hero engagingly silly and offbeat particularly in his workout scenes with the frustrated irascible Shifu. Villain Tai-Lung voiced with fearsome dignity by Ian McShane is one of the best cartoon baddies since Shere Khan and his prison-escape set piece is the standout here explosive and enthralling.This is where the movie comes into its own. The action sequences are often astounding the high-octane animated choreography superbly executed. Theres nothing radical about the visuals themselves - the character and landscape design is entirely by-the-numbers. But weve never seen a cartoon move this fast before the camera leaping and swooping along with its gravity-proof protagonists. As the credits roll the films many flaws come sharply into focus. But while it lasts Kung-Fu Panda is something of a guilty treat.

He sparks their resentment and contempt when improbably hes recognized as the incarnation of the fabled Dragon Warrior and begins training under their disapproving master (Dustin Hoffman).

In his case being computer-animated and fully anthropomorphized he also works at his dads noodle shop in the shadow of the great Jade Palace. But he longs for more. He dreams of Kung Fu glory alongside his idols the Furious Five who train inside the misty palace grounds above the store. Their action figures hold a hallowed place in his bedroom and they rock. Majorly. So does Po but he doesnt know that yet. Nobody knows that yet -- except need we add the audience which has seen the trailer and knows the drill when it comes to pixilated summer kid-flicks. In the mythical land of DreamWorks an ogre can be a king (for a while) and a Panda can be a kick-tail chop-socky fighting machine. The plot it seems offers no particular shockers. But Kung Fu Panda is a surprise in the best sense because it works its formulaic premise into an adorably zippy bundle of wry fanboy humor and gymnastically imagined combat. The slack Jack Black is no stranger to family fare (School of Rock) or broad-girthed martial-arts spoofs (Nacho Libre) but his voice work as Po just might be the most spirited and endearing characterization of his career. Animation crews have so nailed those Blackian facial expressions (the hem-and-hawing side-of-mouth delivery the slightly demonic eyebrow tilt) that I may forever after see him as a panda. Dude there are worse things. I enjoyed this film; my 7-year-old giggled deliriously from Pos first wind-sucking ascent up the palace steps to his last. Much is made of his large size and small lung capacity a running joke that never wears thin (so to speak) because Black keeps coming up with fresh new ways to gasp. Pos physical limitations are further tested when hes tapped by the wise and mystical Master Oogway (a large wrinkly turtle voiced by Randall Duk Kim) to be trained as the legendary Dragon Warrior the savior prophesied to defend the Valley of Peace from a vicious and steroidal snow leopard (Ian McShane milking it). Karate Kid sequences follow. Po must overcome his own fears the annoyance of the peevish Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman perfect as a techy red panda) and the resentment of the Furious Five Mantis (Seth Rogen) Crane (David Cross) Viper (Lucy Liu) Tigress (Angelina Jolie) and monkey (Jackie Chan speaking of Kung Fu masters). Wildly choreographed fight scenes ensue with the genres preposterous athleticism -- aerial kicks and punches and flips and spins and blocks over rooftops and under the moon all of it sprung free from gravity. But the animation takes its cues as well from ancient Chinese artwork and the deep vault of Hollywood fantasy epics and the result is positively gorgeous. Marvel at the swirling lavender petals of a peach tree. To be exact ""the sacred peach tree of heavenly wisdom"" and Oogway finds Po beneath it cramming fruit into his mouth. Thats the division of labor Oogway invokes wisdom Po eats it. No martial-arts movie is complete without a fair dose of greeting-card philosophizing and Kung Fu Panda complies. From Oogway we learn that ""There are no accidents"" and ""One often meets his destiny on the road to avoid it"" and ""Today is a gift that is why it is called the present"" -- though Im pretty sure that last one came from Babatunde Olatunji. So the aphorisms creak. The plots an open book. But all of those cliches are part of the joke in this ebullient ursine coming-of-age tale about a humble panda destined for greatness -- and dumplings but greatness first. He might have a belly but he soars. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Dicks Sporting Goods Clearance Sale Extra 40% off + free...

"Review Panda is bear-ly good - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Panda is bear-ly goodStory Highlights ""Kung Fu Panda"" is a virtual Jack Black vehicle says reviewer Tom Charity Animated film is about panda picked as chosen one to defend valley Black has plenty to do but rest of name cast wasted reviewer says Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Ever since Robin Williams turn as the Genie in ""Aladdin"" voice artists who specialize in character work for animated movies have been sidelined by celebrities no doubt tickled to do something they can show to their children. Jack Black tackles the voice of an energetic panda in the animated feature ""Kung Fu Panda."" DreamWorks Animation especially has invested in star power -- though the studios rationale must be to flatter an older media-savvy audience. (After all its the place that teamed Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese in ""Shark Tale"" and loaded the ""Shrek"" franchise with the dulcet tones of Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas.) Too often though DreamWorks movies coast on lazy pop cultural references in place of the deeper story and character development found in Pixar productions. ""Kung Fu Panda"" goes a step further. Its essentially an old-fashioned star vehicle a virtual Jack Black movie that saves us the dubious pleasure of watching the real Jack Black doing the splits. (If you doubt that he could check out the gravity-defying stunts an effects-enhanced Adam Sandler is capable of in ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan."" Or on second thought just take my word for it.) Black is Po a tubby panda who dreams of kung fu ""awesomeness"" but whose career prospects boil down to inheriting his fathers noodle stand. That is until doddery turtle Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) baffles everyone by anointing Po the ""Dragon Warrior"" a champion who will defend the valley from the wrath of mighty snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane). This inexplicable appointment not only threatens the safety of the entire community it infuriates Oogways small ratlike lieutenant Shifu (a petulant Dustin Hoffman) who has dedicated himself to grooming a group called the Furious Five for just this task Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross). iReport.com Share your review of ""Kung Fu Panda"" How can a chubby novice such as Po compete with these fierce warriors let alone his former protege Tai Lung? Shifu puts Po through the wringer in the hope that hell see sense and quit but along with his prodigious appetite for chop suey it turns out the panda is also quite the glutton for punishment. In other words this is a fortune cookie variation that heroic slacker Black has played many times before Po may look out of shape but what he lacks in strength discipline and intelligence he more than makes up for in gut(s). You dont mess with the Po man. The action tends to blur into a whirlwind of slapstick chaos. Choreography of kung fu between a snake or a mantis and a leopard may be too anatomically mindboggling to animate in greater detail. Bruce Lee was fast but at least he had hands. The highlight is Pos breakthrough training bout with Shifu a brilliantly inventive comic tour de force built around a solitary dumpling. Directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson the film is brisk and businesslike with an appropriately ersatz Chinatown look but it doesnt betray any personality beyond Blacks. Not that he isnt engaging but it seems a waste of resources that Chan Rogen Liu and Jolie share about a dozen lines between them. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is fun as far as it goes but unless youre 12 youll be hankering for something a bit more substantial half an hour after its over. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is rated PG and runs 95 minutes.

Much of it though is an inspired hilarious mess. The organizing idea -- the disorganized organizing idea -- combines Jewish James Bond webless Spider-Man and gross-out ""Shampoo."" Adam Sandlers Zohan is an Israeli counter-terrorist operative who despite his superpowers wants to be a hair stylist and make the world silky smooth. Why? Dont ask. Or ask but the answer is why not since Mr. Sandler and his co-writers Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow havent written a silky-smooth script so much as concocted a lumpy hummus of antic notions. On paper the movie must have looked invitingly idiotic. On screen it looks crazed but the comic energy is huge if indiscriminate and Mr. Sandlers performance -- think Topol doing Charles Boyer -- can be as delicate as it is gleefully vulgar or grotesque. In Israel the heros nemesis is a Palestinian terrorist the Phantom whos played by John Turturro. (The Phantom and Jesus Mr. Turturros character in ""The Big Lebowski"" could bowl on the same team.) In New York where Zohan reinvents himself as a hairdresser named Scrappy Coco he gets entry-level work in a beauty parlor owned by a lovely Palestinian -- shes played by Emmanuelle Chriqui -- but theres no rest for the combat-weary; soon hes fighting Arab terrorists anew. (The New York neighborhood with Arabs on one side of the street and Jews on the other recalls the fast-food rivalry of the Oscar-winning short ""West Bank Story."") The script serves in its scatter-shot way as a parable of endless conflict between Arabs and Jews. Yet the political parody seldom catches fire and the story stops dead in its crabwise tracks for some frantic nonsense in which a greedy landlord turns predatory developer and Mariah Carey plays herself with agonizing difficulty. ""Zohan"" which was directed by Dennis Dugan rises to its subject most reliably by aiming low -- though not so low as the dim sequence in which Zohan smuggles himself into America in the cargo hold of a jet in the company of two shaggy dogs. Mr. Sandler is at his best when Zohan sporting a pizza-size star of David is using kung fu moves to tie people (literally) in knots; strutting his stuff like a demented John Travolta; scaring a spoiled brat in the highest tradition of W.C. Fields (""When I was your age Id already killed seven men -- maybe you should grow up"") or seducing elderly patrons of his salon. When Zohan goes beyond seducing them the movie goes beyond the pale but thats not to say it isnt appallingly funny. Mongol If the Genghis Khan of ""Mongol"" were running for president hed give Hillary Obama or McCain a gallop for their money. Sergei Bodrovs thrilling steppe epic upgrades the brutal head of those bloodthirsty hordes to the status of visionary. This Mongol of all Mongols is a modern merciful leader ahead of his time -- 800 years ahead of his time. Hes so cool and self-contained in his sense of personal destiny that its no wonder scads of nomads follow him. The director who wrote the script with Arif Aliyef might have called it ""Temudgin"" though that doesnt quite sing as a selling title. Genghis Khan was born with that name in 1162 and Temudgins emergence from boyhood into full and fearless manhood is the subject of the movie the first part of a projected trilogy. The production was Kazakhstans entry for a best-foreign-film Oscar in the most recent Academy Awards but its a huge and hugely impressive international enterprise. Mr. Bodrov is the Russian filmmaker best known to American audiences for the superb 1997 drama ""Prisoner of the Mountain."" The adult Temudgin is played -- with remarkable intensity -- by the Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano. Honglei Sun whos Chinese is the heros blood brother and mortal enemy the mercurial funny and frightening Jamukha. Temudgins wife a beautiful woman named Borte is played by the movies only Mongolian star Khulan Chuluunn and its her first time in front of a camera. Shes a great argument for native talent and against acting classes. I dont know the Mongolian word for panache but ""Mongols"" got plenty of it. The battle scenes are as notable for their clarity as their intensity; we can follow the strategies get a sense of whos losing and whos winning. The physical production is sumptuous. (The film was shot by Sergey Trofimov who is Russian and Rogier Stoffers who is Dutch.) And through all of Temudgins extravagant trials and hard-won triumphs theres a sense of a singular child serving as father to a powerful man whose power flows from his instinctive devotion to justice and to his wife. Its an austere epic that turns the stuff of pulp adventure into a persuasive take on ancient history. Kung Fu Panda In a more mundane world than the beautiful mythical China of ""Kung Fu Panda"" the roly poly hero Po voiced by the rolyer poly Jack Black would be a candidate for Overeaters Anonymous -- he cant lay off the carbs. In the world of animated features the team responsible for this script might qualify for Underwriters Anonymous and thats no knock on the insurance industry. Most of the characters are as sketchy as the production design is inventive luminous and elegant. The essence of the film is slapsticky chopsocky action rendered with great verve and accompanied by bromides having to do with the need to believe. Po needs all the help he can get. The clumsy son of a goose who runs a noodle shop -- I dont believe the movie ever explains why a panda should have been sired by a goose -- he has dreamed of being a kung fu master. But this corpulent Asian cousin of Pooh Bear has little more than his dreams going for him when he is suddenly chosen as the Dragon Warrior -- I dont believe the movie makes much of a case for that choice either -- and expected to defend his village against a villain who has escaped from a prison with 1000 guards. (The abundance of talent on the voice track includes Dustin Hoffman Angelina Jolie Jackie Chan and Randall Duk Kim.) ""Kung Fu Panda"" begins with a promise of edgy wit. ""Legend tells"" a smarmy narrator intones ""of a legendary warrior whose life was legend."" But the film soon settles into a succession of ritual spoofs of the kung fu genre and peddles the sort of cloying preachments about self-esteem and human potential -- panda potential -- that little kids hear all the time on TV. There is Pos master says no secret ingredient theres only you and your special gifts. To make something special you just have to believe its special. Yadda yadda yadda. To make a movie special its not enough to have brilliant animation. You have to believe in telling good stories. When Did You Last See Your Father? When Did You Last See Your Father?"" is an eloquent and affecting evocation of a man who remains bigger than life even as he approaches death. Its adapted from the well-known book of the same name by the English poet Blake Morrison who published his memoir in 1993 after his father had died. (Anand Tucker directed from a script by David Nicholls.) The father Arthur Morrison is played by the inimitable Jim Broadbent. The son played by Colin Firth has a lifetime of hurts to come to terms with his fathers minor duplicities major philanderings and volcanic magnetic narcissism. ""How did you put up with it?"" Blake asks his mother. (Shes played mutedly by Juliet Stevenson who is only four years older than Mr. Firth.) The answer is not easily. For mother and son alike it has taken the pain of watching him die to be able to love him for who hes been. DVD Tip In its theme Tim Burtons ""Big Fish"" (2003) strongly resembles ""When Did You Last See Your Father?"" Albert Finney is the father Edward Bloom and Billy Crudup is Will the estranged son who comes home to see the old man who is dying. But Mr. Burton fills the screen with surreal stories that Edward has told about himself. Part of Wills task is to reach an understanding that his father was to a great extent the sum total of the stories he told.

"Kung Fu Panda Panders to the predictable | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsLifeParentKung Fu Panda Panders to the predictable Jack Black plays a bear whose father is a goose in Kung Fu Panda  an animated comedy where the fur really flies.Jack Black voices a would-be warrior schooled by master battler Dustin Hoffman in Kung Fu Panda.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 6 2008 Animated comedy featuring the voices of Jack Black Dustin Hoffman Angelina Jolie Lucy Liu Ian McShane and Randall Duk Kim. Directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson. 92 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Jack Black plays a bear whose father is a goose in Kung Fu Panda an animated comedy where the fur really flies.Article Continued BelowNo reason is given for this strange genealogy which Blacks character Po barely notices and you should cling to this bit of whimsy.Its the only moment of invention in the movie which panders to the predictable.Neither as original as Ratatouille nor as funny as Shrek Blacks star turn as a corpulent panda struggling to become a martial arts warrior frequently manages to amuse if not entirely to delight. Its as if DreamWorks Animation designed it from the burger toys on down with the threadbare story a mere afterthought. The characters are cute the visuals vivid and the premise about believing in yourself is admirable especially if youre of the age where Pablum is a food choice rather than a put-down.Anyone older than that may yawn at the rote journey Po makes from noodle shop delivery boy to kung fu master. Wanna bet that the bear dreams Bruce Lee dreams not the ""Noodle Dream"" of his dad yet cant do a kick or a flip unless it involves the acquisition of food? Wanna further bet that Po will be teamed with a kung fu instructor who resembles Yoda in word and deed and that mean critters will challenge the rookie? Co-directors John Stevenson and Mark Osborne have Shrek and SpongeBob SquarePants on their resumes; are they saving their better moves for sequels to those movies?Its not that its so terrible having a story that resembles countless other tales about finding yourself through self-motivation. Kung Fu Panda is first and foremost a childrens movie and it succeeds admirably at the task. But it has you thinking that Pos black-and-white colouring is a sly ad for Xerox.Jack Black is the obvious choice to play Po and thats both a positive and a negative. You have no trouble whatsoever imagining his grinning girth beneath the CGI bear suit. But like Jerry Seinfelds Barry B. Benson in the stingless Bee Movie its also hard to accept the character as a unique personality. Dustin Hoffman is more of an offside choice as Shifu the red panda sage who is unhappily charged with turning Po into a Dragon Warrior capable of defending his Chinese homeland. Hoffman clearly relishes his role even more than Black does Po but hes not given much from screenwriters Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger who were far funnier as scribes for TVs King of the Hill.Hoffman at least doesnt share the fate of turtle guru Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) the patriarch of Pos valley who sounds like hes being profound when he says things like ""Today is a gift. That is why it is called the present."" Then it kicks in that each and every one of Oogways bromides are stolen from fortune cookies and Hallmark cards.Strangest of all is the waste of talent in the voicing for the Furious Five the menagerie of kung fu artisans whom Oogway passes over when he anoints Po as the Dragon Warrior. The five are Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Viper (Lucy Liu) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen) a formidable crew indeed. They could populate a movie of their own but in Kung Fu Panda they are reduced almost to cameo status.The lack of story may not matter to those seeking action which the movie delivers plenty of - and theres real comedy in a sequence where Shifu schools Po by having him chase yummy dumplings.There may even be too much action for younger viewers. The main villain is a jealous snow leopard named Tai Lung (Ian McShane) who escapes from prison and vows to destroy Oogways happy valley.Tai Lung is quite ferocious at odds with the pictures steady tone of kung-foolery another thing thats all too common in childrens movies.

Mais oui if the festival is Cannes which has been hospitable to animation from the start; Walt Disneys Make Mine Music and Dumbo won prizes the first two years. More recently DreamWorks Shrek had a lavish premiere here; and last year Marjane Satrapis Iranian-French animated autobiography Persepolis copped the Jury Prize on its way to international renown and an Oscar nomination. (But never a Pixar movie though several would have been ready for a mid-May slot. Go figure.) Today DreamWorks unveiled its latest ani-movie Kung Fu Panda. As cunning visual art and ultra-satisfying entertainment it proved an excellent choice. In ancient China a pudgy young panda named Po (voiced by Jack Black) dreams of ""legends full of legendary warriors whose exploits are the stuff of legends."" In these Technicolor daydreams even the legendary Furious Five are no match for a pandas bodacity. In real life or as real as a cartoon fantasy gets Po is the waiter in the village noodle shop run by his father (James Hong) -- who happens to be a goose but never mind. When Po hears that the thousand-year-old turtle Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) is to anoint the Dragon Warrior that day he schleps his noodle wagon to the ceremony and through the some mind-numbing plot contortions is declared the new kung fu hero. There must be some mistake. Hes a clumsy doofus for whom rising from a supine position can take all morning. Yet he is the one chosen to battle the evil master Tin Lung (Ian McShane) wholl be breaking out of prison any moment now. KFP from a clever screenplay by ex-King of the Hill writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger is a tribute to the literally hundreds of 70s Hong Kong martial arts dramas that flooded Saturday-morning U.S. TV in the wake of Bruce Lees success with Enter the Dragon. The plot of a laggard who undergoes rigorous training to become a great fighter is familiar from many Jackie Chan films including the one that made him a star Drunken Master. Fans of Chang Chehs Five Venoms movies will have no trouble spotting this movies Furious Five the Crane (David Cross) Viper (Lucy Liu) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Tigress (Angelina Jolie) and Monkey -- voiced by Chan himself as a way of lending his vocal blessing to the project. Chans confidence was well placed. Directors John Stevenson and Mark Osborne may have an unhealthy fondness for humiliating physical humor -- there are more sight gags of fat creatures hurting themselves than in an entire run of Super Bowl commercials -- but they are essentially respectful toward the conventions of martial arts films and the Zen spirituality underlining them. Once Po stops tripping over things and devotes himself to the exhausting curriculum devised by his Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) the movie shifts into high martial-arts gear with some sequences so smartly thought out and spectacularly executed that they might have been designed by an ace stunt coordinator like Yuen Wo-ping. One scene which has Po and Shifu dueling with chopsticks stilts and tree branches to grab the last available dumpling is an instant classic. I wish Po were more persuasively drawn; visually hes just not a charming character. But all the others are especially Shifu who is a wonderful conveyor of emotional nuance. Theres heart in his art and in the movie as well. Thats the secret ingredient for a traditional animated feature even one as kung-furious as this. --R.C. WAR IS CEL For the seven decades since Walt Disney made Snow White most animated features have followed the Disney mold cute and colorful with talking animals and a coming-of-age plot meant to inspire and amuse. Even a seeming exception like Persepolis found saving humor in its girl-grows-up story. Ari Formans Waltz With Bashir is a break from all this an animated documentary about the lingering subterranean effects of war on the director and some old friends who had served in the Israeli Army during the 1982 incursion into Lebanon. The are still haunted by the massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps perpetrated by followers of the assassinated Christian Phalangist leader Bashir Gemayal. One friend tells Forman of a recurring nightmare 26 wild dogs gallop through a town and stop to howl menacingly at the mans window. He explains that when Israeli soldiers neared a Lebanese town dogs would bark at them alerting the locals to invaders so his job was to shoot the dogs. Forman gets to wondering what experiences of war he may have repressed and this leads him to interview other veterans of his brigade. The movie was first shot as a regular video then stylized (by Yoni Goodman) into its current form using three forms of animation Flash old-fashioned cel and state-of-the-art CGI. The look is spare and evocative with simple renderings of the conversations that splash into hallucinatory images of the soldiers emerging naked from the sea a man finding refuge on that sea in the raft-like body of a huge beautiful woman. Formans background is in documentary films plus a stint writing for the 2005 Israeli miniseries adapted for HBO as In Treatment. (He wrote three episodes for the series haunted soldier who was played by Assi Dayan the son of Defense Minister and war hero Moshe Dayan.) Like generations of Israelis Forman grew up in a country that is besieged by hostile neighbors even as it occupies land the Palestinians consider their own. That twin feeling of being both prisoners and police might give anyone restless dreams. But the soldiers whose commanders did nothing to stop the 1982 massacre while injured women fled from the camps begging the soldiers for help are especially susceptible to long-term remorse. Though the war was decades ago and the combatants middle-Eastern the issues the film raises are in no way provincial. Waltz With Bashir should touch all those who see it -- both the vast majority who have been raised on gung-ho war movies and the small minority who find that the truth is the opposite of the fiction. ""Its like nothing youve seen in American movies"" Forman has said. ""No glam no glory. Just very young men going nowhere shooting at no one they know getting shot by no one they know then going home and trying to forget. Sometimes they can. Most of the time they cannot."" In this sense the movie might have been made about Americans today. We can debate the toxic consequences of the U.S. occupation of Iraq but an equally troubling and potentially more lasting question is the effect of the Iraq occupation on U.S. soldiers. The dreadful nature of that conflict hasnt touched most Americans. Its troops alone bear the scar of war; they carry it home with them -- if they come home -- and those nightmares may never end. Waltz With Bashir is about the cold fingers of memory that clutch the heart. Formans exemplary film says that only by exposing the wounds can they begin to heal. The message of the futility of war has rarely been painted with such bold strokes. -- M.C.

Photo Dreamworks Review Kung Fu Panda kicks up the comedy 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Kung Fu Panda Animation. Starring (the voices of) Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman. Directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson. (PG. 88 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) First about that title ""Kung Fu Panda."" On the plus side it kind of says it all doesnt it? Just lays it right out there. On the downside well ... it kind of says it all doesnt it? This is a movie about a kung fu fighting panda. And because its an animation - and because animations tend to be overly skewed toward the rags-to-riches plot formula - you know at once the general outline of the story from beginning to end. Hes going to start off a little sad. Hes going to be under-estimated. Then hes going to be challenged. And oh maybe along the way he might get into a kung fu fight or two. Do you think hes going to lose? Get a concussion? Get killed? Or by chance do you think he might be triumphant and get hailed as a hero. Thats a multiple-choice question and if youre over the age of 8 you know the answer. Now what most filmmakers do with a movie like this is figure hey this is a movie for children 8 or under so what if this is an old formula? The kids havent seen it all before and if their parents have so what? No one asked them to have children. These parents made a choice and now they have to watch a lot of ghastly childrens movies. ""Sex and the City"" is playing in the auditorium next door and ""Iron Man"" is on the other side but they have to spend Saturday afternoon watching kids movies take it and like it. But ""Kung Fu Panda"" is different. Yes it essentially follows the broad outline of a rags-to-riches childrens movie but it wakes up the formula with imaginative scenes lively and likable characters genuinely funny moments and animation thats detailed and beautiful to behold. At times it looks almost three-dimensional. (I didnt see the IMAX version and can only imagine how good that looks.) This is a streamlined opulent and thoroughly enjoyable kids movie. In fact Im going to go out on a limb here and say that this is probably the best movie so far this year about a kung-fu fighting panda - and that it will probably stand as the best until ""Kung Fu Panda II"" if that ever comes along. It has a good hero. Hes fat and cuddly. Hes not homely like Shrek. Hes cute and he has nice teeth. Hes voiced by Jack Black who brings lots of energy and new shadings and colors to his vocal work. The latter could also be said for Dustin Hoffman who plays the tiny kung fu master. His is one of the most recognizable voices in movies. (Listen very closely ... ""Mrs. Robinson are you trying to seduce me?"" You can hear it right?) Yet it takes a while to realize the master is indeed Hoffman. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is neither sentimental nor does it try for overly clever anti-sentiment. It tells the straightforward story of Po the panda a kung fu fan whose life is limited by his endless work in his fathers noodle restaurant. Theres a brilliant early sequence in which Po rushes off to the Dragon Warrior competition a huge stadium event. The camera pulls backward over a bustle of activity then drops and drops to find Po at the bottom of a long stairway with his noodle wagon. He watches the proceedings from a porthole and from a crack in the door and never stops trying to get in until by accident he finds himself in the center of the arena. In that sequence and throughout ""Kung Fu Panda"" gets across important and inevitable plot information in ways that are novel and unexpected. Things simply dont happen the way they usually happen in animated stories. Martial arts training for example is usually accomplished through a montage with some loud triumphal music blaring over the soundtrack. Here the filmmakers come up with a funny way for Po to be trained involving his prodigious (bear-appropriate) appetite for goodies. Other famous voices featured are those of Angelina Jolie (Tigress) Jackie Chan (Monkey) and Seth Rogen (Mantis) but directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson keep the performances self-effacing and in service of the story. They dont perform their star personalities and if you didnt know who they were going in you probably wouldnt guess.

Kung Fu Panda. (PG) Paramount/DreamWorks (91 min.) Directed by Mark Osborne John Stevenson. With the voices of Jack Black Dustin Hoffman Angelina Jolie Jackie Chan. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. THREE STARS The title sounds a little like one of those migraine-inducing manga imports that exist solely to sell trading cards and the cast of voices is an ensemble straight out of an opium dream. But dont worry parents ""Kung Fu Panda"" is a relatively harmless bit of animated fun. Just dont blame me if your kids leave it shouting ""Hiii-yaaah"" and aiming kicks at each other. The production comes from DreamWorks animation division which has always had an interest in ethnic stories -- and a spotty record. ""The Prince of Egypt"" and its tale of the ancient Hebrews was fine but the Hispanic ""The Road to El Dorado"" was a snooze and ""Sinbad Legend of the Seven Seas"" a Middle Eastern disaster. Given the prospect of yet another cultural outreach program -- well Id rather rewatch ""Shrek."" ""Kung Fu Panda"" though manages to avoid both PC panda-ring and ethnic offense. True most of the main characters have blue or green eyes and are voiced by Caucasians -- but then the cast is a regular zoo of tigers snakes and monkeys. (In the best joke -- mostly because it has no punchline -- our dense ursine hero never asks why his father is literally a silly goose.) The plot is straight from a Run Run Shaw kung-fu actioner in which a rogue kung-fu warrior is on the march against his former school and an awkward new student must be rapidly trained to face him. The theme meanwhile is by-the-book modern kids stuff -- believe in yourself everyone is special you can do it. (Cartoons long ago replaced old-time moral lessons with the pop-psych language of validation empowerment and self-esteem.) Luckily the action quotient is high -- far higher than usual actually for a PG cartoon -- with warriors twisting each other into knots and never thank heavens pausing to sing a power ballad. And the humor is fairly constant although much of it is pretty simple stuff nonverbal gags based on the pandas ponderous waistline and fairly incessant hunger. Still Jack Black -- the hardest working man in shtick business -- gives our hero an eager-to-please amiability charming even without the use of his hyperbolic eyebrows. Dustin Hoffman meanwhile -- in what must be the oddest role in a very long career -- sputters and fumes as an elderly kung-fu master. The movie falters a bit with its big-star supporting roles only because theres no need for them. Its not her voice that makes Angelina Jolie distinctive so its unclear why she was given the part of one of the pandas classmates. And whats the point in casting Jackie Chan -- who does have a distinctive voice -- if youre going to give his character so little to say? Small ones arent likely to complain though. Theyll be too busy thrilling to villain Ian McShanes escape from a multi-storied prison or a duel along a shaky wooden footbridge. Or laughing at our heros attempts to catapult himself over a high palace wall or free that last dumpling from the chopsticked clutches of his cranky master. And if you give yourself half a chance you probably will be too. Rating note The film contains cartoon violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Not to question anyones ancestry but that seems a low-ball estimate. Black plays the title character as if he were born in a bamboo patch turning the latest from DreamWorks Animation into a big plush funball. Even his voice is roly-poly which sets him up perfectly to embody Po the Panda in a sort of Chinese take on ""Nacho Libre."" PHOTO GALLERY Kung Fu Panda As in that movie Black starts out as a humble food server in a foreign land who yearns to be a legend of combat (this time the characters mask is built-in). Slinging noodles at a humble restaurant (no one seems to notice that his father is a duck) Po is a tomato-shaped fanboy a sort of Hairy Knowles who thrills to the deeds of legendary martial artists the Furious Five. They include Tigress (Angelina Jolie who is not famous because of her voice) Mantis (Rogen who doesnt get enough to do) and Monkey (Jackie Chan). Po pictures fighting beside them ""his enemies [going] blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness."" Blacks bazooka delivery makes that line and pretty much all of them funny. If the guy rattled off the iTunes licensing agreement it would be funnier than ""What Happens in Vegas."" As one of the Furious Five is about to be anointed the next Dragon Warrior Po schemes to watch - but instead tumbles into the middle of the ceremony and finds himself given the honor. ""There are no accidents"" proclaims the placid Obi-Wan-like Master Oogway the turtle (Randall Duk Kim). Oogway leaves it to the more ornery Yoda figure a tiny red panda called Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman an excellent foil) to make something of the pillowy mammal. Po not only cant see the path to true enlightenment he cant see his toes. He has to be tricked into training by making it part of lunch. Adding to the urgency is the problem of the kung fu maven who went bad the imprisoned snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane) who is planning a jailbreak and a raid on the scroll that promises ultimate power. The animation is dazzling so lovingly detailed you can make out individual hairs on the titular beastie and full of bright Chinese images. Background characters at the restaurant - pigs and bunnies - are as cute and friendly looking as Richard Scarry creations while a death is rendered with oblique charm by a blizzard of petals and the action set pieces such as Tai Lungs prison break are boldly stylized eye-poppers. Though the story is ostensibly similar to the cliche of a Westerner learning to accept Eastern ways - recently seen for instance in ""Forbidden Kingdom"" - the story is infiltrated by invincibly American ideals to eat as much as we want to make as much of a racket as we want to ""wash our pits in the pool of Sacred Tears."" Po speaks loudly and carries big shtick. Let the rest of the world cringe at our hyperconfidence our charisma our pure awesomeness. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next THE HOTS FOR SUMMER Read Next THE HOTS FOR SUMMER Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 31723 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 27400 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 16608 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 5 2008 606 PM If ever there were a case of actor matching character it would have to be Jack Black as ""Kung Fu Pandas"" cheerfully rotund Po. Po may be a bear and a two-dimensional one at that. But hes got Blacks outsized personality which has turned out to be surprisingly kid-friendly for a guy who made his name as a head-banging member of Tenacious D.Though solidly conventional ""KFP"" has a charming sweetness underscored by Blacks enthusiastic performance. His Po is a lovable slacker the type who spends all day dreaming about becoming a martial arts master without ever actually moving a muscle. Po and his dad (James Hong) live in Chinas Valley of Peace a name that proves misleading when the evil snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane) threatens to destroy the region. It has been foretold that a great hero may save the valley and most of the locals assume help will come from the Furious Five a group of legendary fighters that includes a tigress (Angelina Jolie) crane (David Cross) mantis (Seth Rogen) viper (Lucy Liu) and monkey (Jackie Chan). Instead however Po is declared the savior - an announcement that shocks everyone including Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). Its Shifus job to train the hero for battle and he cant see any promise in this roly-poly panda. But is it possible that even the most unlikely candidate has the potential for greatness? That anyone can achieve his dreams with faith and hard work? Well of course it is. This is an unashamedly old-fashioned childrens movie and a predictable message is part of the mission. But thats okay; what the movie lacks in surprises it makes up for in whimsical fun. The Chinese backdrops are gorgeous to look at and the martial arts scenes are a blast (if a little scary for very young ones). Besides Black and his co-stars especially Hoffman and McShane are having such a good time that kids wont even notice theyve already seen lessons just like these inside of fortune cookies. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune June 6 2008 -- 1226pm  Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The nicest surprise about ""Kung Fu Panda"" is that its so much better than the goofy-cutesy title would lead you to expect. It entertains with consummate skill and aims to please without (pardon the pun) pandering. The latest computer-animated feature from DreamWorks pushes the envelope of quality as ambitiously as its Pixar rivals. You sense that something special is unreeling after just a few moments. The film is framed in widescreen Cinemascope a big bold format for epic stories of heroism. And the opening moments give us just that. In ancient times Jack Black intones ""legend tells of a legendary warrior whose kung fu skills were the stuff of legend"" The hero is a chubby panda who takes on all comers in a slam-bang anime sequence. Shaking off the dream is our protagonist Po a cute cuddly CGI bear who imagines a life of martial arts heroism while slinging noodles in the family restaurant. His dad is a goose named Mr. Ping (James Hong) which is the kind of thing that just naturally occurs in this fantasy world. The village is abuzz with excitement because for the first time in 1000 years a tournament is being held to select the Dragon Warrior. The five contestants representing famous martial arts styles are Mistress Tiger (Angelina Jolie); Mantis (Seth Rogen); Monkey (Jackie Chan); Crane (David Cross) and Viper (Lucy Liu). Their trainer is tiny impossibly unruffled Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). To the surprise of all the wise and ancient creator of kung fu Oogway the tortoise (Randall Duk Kim) chooses slow clumsy Po instead. Its not just because of the honor involved. The Dragon Warrior must defend the village from snow-leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane) a former student of Shifu. KUNG FU PANDA  OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating PG for sequences of martial arts action. Anyone whos ever seen a chopsocky movie knows what comes next. The lovable underdog develops astonishing martial arts skills (training like a fiend to earn steamed dumplings) and saves the day. Directors John Stevenson and Mark Osborne thrive in the martial arts genre because its simple rules of good guys vs. bad guys gave them plenty of room to concentrate on comedic characters. Theres not a lot of unnecessary exposition standing in the way of the gags. Still the traditions of the genre are treated with affectionate irreverence not mocking parody. ""Pandas"" creative team loves the films that inspired them. The story oscillates between humor and sincerity as it explores the tension between strained family relationships and conformity to traditional codes of honor. The film never panders for our tears; its misty moments are guilelessly touching. At heart ""Panda"" is a parable about loyalty individualism and the fine line between good and evil told with lots of acrobatics stunts and gags. The action scenes are less manic than balletic with an undertone of loopy slapstick. Classic kung fu fighting always verges on the absurd anyhow as any Jackie Chan fan understands. But its not all about action. The backgrounds are meticulously composed and lush with the kind of visual spectacle you might see in an Asian art film. The music is a suitably orchestral score by Hans Zimmer rather than a grab-bag of contemporary pop tunes. The character animation is outstanding; Pos expressions are bug-eyed slack-jawed marvels to behold. And the vocal performances are uniformly strong. Blacks turn as the endearing buffoon-hero is a perfect match of casting and character. Hoffman is a dry delight as the unflappable Shifu who adds shadings of worldly sophistication and sarcasm to even throwaway lines. Appropriately for a film where food plays such a key role ""Kung Fu Panda"" is a pu-pu platter of savory delights ridiculously enjoyable for film-literate audiences and impatient kids alike.

"Black and white - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-AnimationMOVIE REVIEW Black and whitePanda is visually so lush. The flip side is that its so Jack Black.June 06 2008|Carina Chocano | Times Movie Critic IF THE world of computer feature animation were say a couple of characters in a sitcom Pixar would be the smart sensitive well-mannered overachiever and DreamWorks would be the loud bumbling insecure media-addled doofus. Which is why the gorgeous highly stylized old-school 2-D hand-drawn animation sequence at the beginning of ""Kung Fu Panda"" comes as such a big surprise.For a moment youre lulled into believing that the studio that never met a moldy pop-culture reference it didnt want to marry has undergone a lightning-bolt conversion to sophisticated confident storytelling. But it all turns out to be a dream. Literally. The sequence that kicks off the movie is the recurring dream of a three-dimensional panda bear named Po whose every strand of panda fur is lovingly digitally rendered by a bank of computers.Thats not to say that ""Kung Fu Panda"" doesnt look good. For a DreamWorks production especially it looks fantastic. Gone are the studios usual penchant for garishness and lack of stylistic unity; the claustrophobic sealed-in worlds; the horrible neon colors; the feeling that everythings been dipped in a hard plastic coating. Instead production designer Raymond Zibach and art director Tang Heng who spent years researching Chinese art and architecture (not to mention kung fu movies) have inserted vast moody misty landscapes fanciful interiors and traditional Chinese colors (red and gold dominate) to give the movie an epic expansive ancient quality thats a real pleasure to inhabit.The character design is clever too. The Furious Five the greatest kung fu masters in the land are anthropomorphized animals based on the Shaolin five animal fighting system. Theres Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie) Crane (David Cross) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey (Jackie Chan). The action heavily influenced by Hong Kong martial arts films is beautifully choreographed.Then theres the panda whose main function is to temper all this loveliness by bringing us back down to Earth -- Earth being naturally America circa now. Po is voiced by (and in many ways modeled on the persona of) Jack Black. An overweight and lazy arrested adolescent of indeterminate age Po lives with his noodle-making father in the peaceful valley below the Jade Palace where Zen master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) kung fu master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his disciples the Furious Five reside. Po is expected to take over the family business someday but dreams instead of becoming a kung fu master. Not that he has any kung fu skills or training or talents. Apart from a complete set of Furious Five action figures and an active fantasy life he has none of what it takes to succeed in his chosen field. Which is OK Because what counts as self-esteem curricula has prescribed and government leaders have demonstrated is that the panda believe in himself no matter what his limitations deficiencies or proclivities and no matter what anybody else thinks.Pos destiny is altered when along with the rest of the village he shows up at the Jade Palace one day to watch Oogway choose a Dragon Warrior among the five masters and winds up getting himself elected instead. Oogways choice is especially egregious in the face of the danger faced by the community Shifus erstwhile top student and son-figure the Luciferian snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane) is said to be planning to escape from prison and attack the valley.""That flabby panda cant possibly be the answer to our problems"" Shifu complains.To which Oogway replies ""There are no accidents.""Thats one example of the many afternoon talk-show platitudes served up by the wise geezers of ""Kung Fu Panda"" and meant to pass for Zen wisdom. Oogway also says things like ""Yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery but today is a gift. Thats why we call it the present."" Thankfully he dies soon afterward.Shifu eventually catches on to the only motivating factor Po responds to -- food -- and manages to train him into a decent fighter. This discovery leads to the funniest sequence in the movie but its pretty dispiriting as far as messages go. The kid who eats unconsciously when hes upset is handed the secret to invincibility after a couple of training sessions? The slacker panda whose favorite word is ""awesome"" is singled out for heroism when all the other characters have worked long and hard (the definition of kung fu) and sacrificed for what theyve accomplished? The message -- believe in yourself even when all evidence suggests you shouldnt -- is annoyingly familiar and frankly overdue for a serious debunking but its not about to happen here.--carina.chocanolatimes.com--""Kung Fu Panda.""

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post How simple it would have been to put the ""pan"" (or ""duh"") in ""Kung Fu Panda."" From early trailers it was hard to believe DreamWorks latest animated feature would turn out to be such a gorgeous sincere fun lesson in duty and desire wisdom and willpower. So let us pause for a humble bow to borrow an MTV Movie Awards hook the second ""Best Summer Movie So Far."" (And better for the tween and younger set than ""Iron Man.) When ""Kung Fu Panda"" starring the voice of Jack Black as the titular hero isnt outright dazzling its winningly wise. When its not delighting us with CGI visions and lush 2D animation its treating characters with tender affection. The life lessons and cross-over pleasures Jackie Chan and Jet Lis ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" aimed for arrive fast and fluidly. Black and a cast that includes Dustin Hoffman Angelina Jolie and Randall Duk Kim contribute mightily to the films persistent charms. But directors John Stevenson and Mark Osborne and writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger have made this homage to martial-arts flicks a classic that goes beyond genre. As the PG movie begins a panda confronts his foes. ""I see you like to chew"" he says from beneath a bamboo peasant hat before delivering justice with his fists of furry. Its ridiculous fun. And the rousing scene isnt quite what it seems. Soon were in the company of Po a roly-poly Panda who lives with his father in a small village in the Valley of Peace. So vibrant is the opening sequence I felt cheated when the movie switches from angular 2D animation (reminiscent of Cartoon Networks ""Samurai Jack"") to the cuddlier computer-generated images that give shape to Po and the valleys inhabitants. Whats briefly lost is more than made up for as the story unfolds. And there are plenty of beguiling visuals yet to come including a blossom swirl of a soul passing and a visit to a foreboding prison that plunges us into dark grays and richer shadows. Pos tale of unlikely heroism is at once familiar and fresh. Son of Mr. Ping (James Hong) a goose known for his noodles Po is a martial arts geek a Kung Fu fan-da who knows all the lore and skills of ""the Furious Five"" fighters who occupy the temple atop the nearby mountain. Mr. Ping likes to remind his Po ""we are noodle folk; broth runs in our veins."" How a bulky black- and-white bear wound up the scion to a long line of noodle-shop owners is a mystery. Hoffman and Kim play martial-arts master Shifu and sage tortoise Oogway inventor of Kung Fu. Jolie voices Tigress the most gifted of Shifus students. Along with Viper (Lucy Liu) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen) Tigress hopes to fulfill the prophesy of the Dragon Warrior and save the valley. Instead an accident of timing in a movie in which ""there are no accidents"" turns Po into the foretold hero. Ian McShanes snow leopard Tai Lung makes an impressive nemesis. You may even find yourself rooting for the big cat when hes shackled in Chorh-Gum Prison. Hes glorious. ""Kung Fu Panda"" offers plenty of lessons. The richest might be about appreciating your roots but also honoring what you can become if you pursue your own dreams. Not that Po is prepared for his fantasies to be realized. Hence another lesson Watching is not the same as doing. ""I understand -- you eat when you are sad"" Oogway says to Po. Later a fight-training montage ends with a fabulous duel and an even more nourishing epiphany. If not for the dismaying (and cynical) Happy Meals marketing tie-in Po could have provided inspiration for the millions of overweight American kids with big dreams and bigger bodies. Its not that he develops six-pack abs. Hes a panda for crying out loud. But he does become fit and focused. Perhaps this sounds heavy. But with loads of laugh lines ""Kung Fu Panda"" plays with the ying- yang tension of sincerity and irreverance. And it never shirks a popcorn tenet kernels of wisdom must be tasty.

By Peter Rainer June 7 2008 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Martial arts movies are often comedic even when they dont intend to be. The whoops and hollers and high kicks inevitably carry an element of self-parody. Jackie Chan certainly understood this and so do the filmmakers behind the Dreamworks animated feature ""Kung Fu Panda"" which not coincidentally employs Chan as a voice-over artist for a character called ""Monkey."" But its the panda (voiced by Jack Black) thats the star attraction here. Designated as the long-awaited Dragon Warrior the pot-bellied courage-free slacker is an unlikely candidate to go up against the tigerish kung fu master Tai Lung who regards the 1000 guards assigned to imprison him as a mere nuisance. The animation is consistently sporty and there are some choice comic riffs on martial arts movies. Grade B+ (Rated PG for sequences of martial arts action.)

"This bears up - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs This bears upDreamWorks latest a flying leap above other animationsJune 06 2008|By Michael Phillips TRIBUNE CRITICKUNG FU PANDA  1/2Everything about ""Kung Fu Panda"" is a little better a little sharper a little funnier than the animated run of the mill. Its one of the few comedies of 2008 in any style or genre that knows what its doing. Plus all its jokes actually belong to the same movie which is set in ancient China by way of Jack Black. In other words it may have Black fulminating about ""[going] blind from overexposure to pure awesomeness"" but nobody slips in a Travis Bickle impersonation or utters some pop-culturally exhausted catchphrase such as ""Make my day"" simply to amuse the parents.With Black voicing the role of a martial arts-obsessed panda who lives his dreams of high-flying glory the film has an air of assurance and rightness of casting from the get-go. Take for example the scene in which star-struck Po tours the Jade Palaces ""sacred hall of warriors."" He cant believe his big panda eyes. ""Master Flying Winos armor--with authentic battle damage The sword of heroes said to be so sharp you can cut yourself just by looking at--ow"" You read those exclamations riffing on Jackie Chans early ""Drunken Master"" success a generation ago and knowing Blacks the one doing the voice you can hear almost precisely how it sounds on-screen coming from a gob-smacked pandas mouth. And it sounds right.""Kung Fu Panda"" works from a time- and profit-honed Dream- Works template the one showcasing the wisenheimer critters of various species. This time though even with a surfeit of battle sequences riffing on live-action martial arts iconography dating back to ""Enter the Dragon"" the energy captivates. All the actors earn their keep from Angelina Jolie playing it earnestly and well as a fearsome tigress to veteran character actor James Hong as Pos dad. He is a goose named Mr. Ping who runs a noodle shop. ""We are noodle folk"" he tells his apparently adopted son who would rather not inherit the family business. The goosey way Hong says it brings a smile to your face.The plot like the quality of the computer animation is at once familiar and well-executed. Po is ancient Chinas most ardent fan of his kung fu heroes the Furious Five. One day Po sneaks away from his noodle duties to witness the ceremony announcing the selection of the ""Dragon Warrior"" protector of the Valley of Peace. After accidentally inserting himself into the selection process Po becomes the chosen one. He must overcome his physical bulk and general geekiness to prove himself to martial arts master Shifu (a gremlinlike rodent voiced wittily in a perpetual mutter by Dustin Hoffman). He must then help save the kingdom from the wrath of a vengeful snow leopard (Ian McShane of ""Deadwood"").Directors John Stevenson and Mark Osborne exploit the various training and battle sequences--one or two too many probably--for all theyre worth. ""Kung Fu Panda"" references everything from Bruce Lee to Stephen Chow to Jackie Chan. (Chan voices one of the Furious Five.). The CinemaScope format allows for a lot of spacious lateral flying kicks and background detail in terms of architecture and topography two things that wont matter in the least to the films target audience unless theyre sons and daughters of landscape architects. But the execution is elegant even at its most slapstick. I particularly like Po and Shifus battle for control of a dumpling waged with chopsticks.Many wont agree with this next statement particularly if theyre fans of the monstrously lucrative ""Shrek"" franchise. But here it is I prefer ""Kung Fu Panda"" to any of the ""Shreks"" along with moderately diverting entertainments such as ""Bee Movie"" plus more grating items such as ""Madagascar"" ""Shark Tale"" and ""Over the Hedge."" Were still a good distance here from a modern classic such as last summers ""Ratatouille"" a work of true and idiosyncratic artistry about a true and idiosyncratic artist. The main virtue of ""Kung Fu Panda"" (doesnt that title just smell like money being minted?) is its skill in freshening up the old formulas with a prime voice cast and a verifiable sense of humor. The story comes from a less cynical place than most other animated features. And by the time the end credits roll the soundtracks use of ""Kung Fu Fighting"" seems like a happy inevitability like so much else in this exuberant studio product.- - -MPAA rating PG (for sequences of martial arts action).Running time 135Opening 1201 a.m Friday.Featuring the voices of Jack Black (Po); Dustin Hoffman (Shifu); Angelina Jolie (Tigress); Ian McShane (Tai Lung); Jackie Chan (Monkey); James Hong (Mr. Ping)Directed by John Stevenson and Mark Osborne; written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger; supervising animator and fight choreographer Rodolphe Guenoden; production design by Raymond Zibach; music by Hans Zimmer and John Powell; produced by Melissa Cobb.

Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / June 6 2008 The star of ""Kung Fu Panda"" is not Jack Black.Its not even Po the martial arts-obsessed animated panda for whom Black provides dude-acious line readings. Rather the movies stars are production designer Raymond Zibach art director Tang Heng visual effects supervisor Markus Manninen and the 4000-processor Linux cluster at the heart of DreamWorks Animations computer rendering farm.Not exactly red-carpet names but welcome to the modern family film - all form no function. ""Kung Fu Panda"" is prototypical non-Pixar animated product as weve come to expect it a lushly beautiful even soulful visual experience yoked to a pro forma story line that wouldnt fool a 3-year-old.What the designers processors and workstation galley slaves have created is a phantasmagoric medieval Chinese otherworld - a Crayola-colored riff on the kung fu landscapes of countless Shaw Brothers movies with titles like ""The New One-Armed Swordsman"" and ""Eight-Diagram Pole Fighter."" Those originals and their ferocious near-camp sensibility have filtered into the American pop consciousness by way of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" Quentin Tarantino movies and the Cartoon Network. Now they get their Happy Meal moment slo-mo tiger leaps and all.So familiar are the genres cliches by now that bolting them onto the tired studio family-film framework - lots of character slapstick interspersed with believe-in-yourself moralizing - fails to enliven either. ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" has already come and gone this year and ""Kung Fu Panda"" goes nowhere surprising even as its images unscroll handsomely before our eyes. The sound could go out in the theater and you wouldnt ask for your money back.Actually that might count as an improvement since you wouldnt have to deal with Black or the limp fortune-cookie aphorisms that tilt the film in the direction of yellowface (""There is no good or bad news. There is only news""). On the other hand you wouldnt be able to hear Dustin Hoffman give his adenoids a workout as Master Shifu the be-robed red panda who serves as this movies Yoda. Hoffmans crafty honk is heard too rarely in movies these days and well take it where we find it.Blacks Po is a bumbling oversize bear who worships wuxia the way fanboys venerate Han Solo action figures. The son of a noodle shop owner (veteran character actor James Hong) whos a goose - the movie seems about to explain that one but then dodges - he crashes the ritual choosing of the Dragon Warrior and ends up with the honor himself.This doesnt sit well with Master Shifu or the martial arts experts known as the Furious Five - Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Crane (David Cross) Viper (Lucy Liu) Mantis (Seth Rogen) and Monkey (Jackie Chan). The villainous Tai Lung (Ian McShane) has escaped from his fortress prison though and a stalwart hero is called for.Cue the training montage the humiliation of the bumbler by his betters the search for self-respect the final confrontation - ""Kung Fu Panda"" tours this highlight reel with the passion of a PowerPoint presentation. Black and Hoffman get most of the dialogue with the rest of the players limited to a few lines each but Blacks neo-Ralph Kramden shtick wears thin fast. Wheres the wit?Its in the look of the thing; occasionally in its pacing too. Id swap the entire movie for the sequence in which Tai Lung escapes his dungeon outmaneuvering the complacent rhino guards and swarms of arrows to clamber toward daylight. It owes too much to the Bridge of Khazad-dum in ""The Lord of the Rings"" but no matter - the scenes alive with the thrill of craft. Same goes for a nighttime sequence in which the Furious Five leap and tumble over pagoda roofs; for a brief second you sense the fluidly beautiful kiddie action movie ""Kung Fu Panda"" might have been.Notice that neither scene features the films star. Without Blacks participation though DreamWorks wouldnt know how to sell the movie and audiences wouldnt know what box to put it in (this was the marketing problem that vexed the vastly superior ""Ratatouille"").

STEPHEN COLE Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 06 2008 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 13 2009 1204PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Kung Fu Panda Directed by John Stevenson and Mark Osborne Written by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger Voices by Jack Black Dustin Hoffman Ian McShane Angelina Jolie Seth Rogen Lucy Liu and Jackie Chan Classification PG 1/2 Everybody loves kung-fu fighting but we absolutely adore pandas. And why not? Theyre endangered smartly decorated and reassuringly vegetarian. Kids everywhere adults too are crazy about them. Thats why China can get away with leasing them to foreign zoos for 1-million (U.S.) a year. Not only are the black and white creatures popular theyre way up there on the anthropomorphic ladder. Did you know pandas have opposable thumbs? Its a wonder DreamWorks made them wait in line behind ogres (the Shrek series) and insects ( Bee Movie) before doing their CGI panda movie. Well its here now and the good news is that Kung Fu Panda unfolds like a magical storybook just the way children like. The film recreates the broken-tooth mountains of the Li River Valley to spectacular effect. Pandas storyline is also sturdily kid-friendly though hardly original. A peaceful Chinese village is threatened by a grouchy snow leopard (voiced by Ian McShane). Their only hope is hopeless - Po a roly-poly panda who loves kung-fu fighting but not as much as he loves steamed dumplings and fat lush peaches. And so we have the essential ingredients of the modern kid-flick parable A fantastic other-world setting in which an awkward child hopes to summon the hero within. All he has to do is believe in himself. Thats hard to do because Po the panda is a nerd extraordinaire with a bad habit of dreaming out loud performing a play-by-play of imagined heroics even as those around him cringe. Po does all this because hes anxious to escape his secret shame because hes irrepressibly exuberant but most of all because hes voiced by Jack Black an actor who believes comic acting to be an Olympic event. Kids will love Blacks Po. Pop-eyed stuttering and reckless slapstick always go over big with wee ones. Parent chaperones however may grow tired of Blacks relentless class clowning - behaviour that will remind them of their own charges when theyve had too much birthday cake. Older viewers might also gripe about the films non-supportive supporting cast. Angelina Jolie (a tigress) Seth Rogen (a praying mantis) Lucy Liu (a viper) David Cross (a crane) and Jackie Chan (a monkey) voice the Furious Five kung-fu superstars who eventually befriend Po. None of the bunch however is the least bit fun. Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu Pos impatient instructor doesnt bring a lot to the party either. This doesnt mean Panda misses its target audience. Kids will love Blacks panda-monium act. The colours are vivid; the scenery spectacular. And the film does lift off on several occasions. The best scene here is a knowing send up/tribute to Hong Kong chopsocky films a funny athletic sequence that has Master Shifu (a Chinese raccoon) and Po clawing high in the air with chopsticks in quest of an escaped dumpling. On the other paw it must be said that the film lacks the comic ingenuity of the best in CGI critter movies. Its not fun-for-the-whole-family like Shrek. Still its a howl and amazement for anyone under 12. As is often the way with middling kids movies parents who grow tired of the film are treated to a satisfying consolation prize watching their children have fun.

DreamWorks hide caption toggle caption DreamWorks Weigh of the Warrior Dumplings (and other incentives) help keep Po on task. DreamWorks Roly-poly Po is mischievous easily distracted perpetually hungry and every bit as martial-arts-besotted as he is clumsy. If he werent a giant panda in fact youd call him a typical preteen. Voiced by Jack Black in the animated adventure Kung Fu Panda the unflappable bamboo-chomper spends his days fantasizing about kicking and chopping his way to glory even as he labors in his fathers Chinese noodle shop. (Dads a goose a fact that none of the other critters seems to find surprising so I guess theres no reason for us to.) Po turns out to be smarter than your average bear not to mention sweet of disposition and amusingly smart-alecky but none of that would seem to qualify him for the post of Dragon Warrior -- a kind of official Town Protector. But at a competition he gets accidentally anointed by a distracted turtle sage and therein hangs our story. The unorthodox choice bypasses the Furious Five -- martial-arts virtuosos Tigress (voiced by Angelina Jolie) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Viper (Lucy Liu) Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen) who despite all that marquee vocal talent have next to no personality -- and obligates the tiny Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman as a harried red panda) to train Po so that he can discover the secret of the Dragon Scroll. A great honor -- except that a thuggish snow leopard is about to escape from prison. Though the films simple story is squarely aimed at tots DreamWorks digitizers have referenced Eastern visual styles -- everything from delicate Chinese screens to flashy Japanese anime -- to enliven the look of the film. Pastel sunsets hazy mountain vistas and dewy flowering trees cant substitute for an engaging storyline of course but theyll no doubt prove distracting for parents as will Hoffmans quirky Yoda-esque line readings. Even for kids the message -- not much more complicated than ""You have to believe in yourself"" -- will be something less than a revelation but theres amusement to be had in the fighting and the training especially when Hoffmans Shifu discovers that food (and only food) will hold Pos attention. Eventually theres a big battle the outcome of which -- like everything else in this charming but studiously formulaic animated romp -- is never in much doubt.

Po mans the street cart (or is it pandas the street cart?) and helps his quacking dad serve lunch for the townsfolk all the while fantasizing about chopping and socking his way through an army of ninjas. He may be a clumsy clown destined for a life of lo mein but in his heart of hearts Pos a martial arts master.If only the rest of the world saw him that way.And then in DreamWorks spirited computer-animated follow-your-dream comedy Po gets the chance to prove himself. In a seemingly fluky series of events - ""seemingly"" because as kung fu guru Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) observes ""there are no accidents"" - Po is chosen to fulfill an ancient prophecy. And chosen to do battle against a demonic snow leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane).Scripted by Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger and directed by Mark Osborne and John Stevenson Kung Fu Panda niftily combines a romping toon aesthetic with a visual grace and color palette culled from traditional Asian art. Cloud-shrouded mountain tops gnarled trees in silhouette stately temples burnished skies - the film is elegant artfully wrought.At the same time the physicality of the characters - from the portly Po to the acrobatic kung fu quintet known collectively as the Furious Five - is rendered in ping-ponging gravity-defying Looney Tunes style.And thanks to a witty script and the recognizably goofy but absolutely earnest delivery of Black Kung Fu Panda has a human soul too. Black invests real emotion into his line readings and real comedy too.Along with Black and Hoffman the A-listers that popped into a recording studio for Kung Fu Panda include Angelina Jolie (as Tigress one of the Furious Five) and Jackie Chan (as Monkey). The other members of the Five - a group of crack kung fu-ers that reluctantly make way for Po - are voiced by David Cross (as Crane) Lucy Liu (as Viper) and Seth Rogen (as Mantis).Kung Fu Panda references underdog sports movies such as Karate Kid and martial arts epics such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and while its storyline might seem familiar (in fact very familiar if youve seen the recent live-action Jackie Chan/Jet Li hit The Forbidden Kingdom) theres enough invention and irreverence to make the film feel fresh.Now if only theyd explain about the duck.

Black is the voice of the title character and directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenson have done more than just rein in his most obnoxious impulses. Theyve also made a surprisingly good film one that blends a big-name cast including Angelina Jolie Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane with lots of fast-paced action humor and feeling. In other words its not the pay-the-stars-for-line-readings money grab that these things sometimes turn out to be. Black is Po a fat lazy giant panda who lives in a Chinese village and dreams of being a martial-arts hero. Unfortunately for him he appears to have the makings of a competitive-eating champion instead. He seems destined to inherit his fathers noodle restaurant until one day when he steals away to see a martial-arts exhibition and winds up being chosen as the legendary Dragon Warrior in fulfillment of an ancient prophecy. Po is picked by Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) an elderly turtle and inventor of kung fu much to the consternation of nearly everyone in particular the Furious Five (Jolie as Tigress David Cross as Crane Seth Rogen as Mantis Lucy Liu as Viper and Jackie Chan as Monkey - talented actors who dont get as much interplay as youd like). They have studied for years under Oogway and Master Shifu (Hoffman) and assumed that one of them would be chosen. Thats understandable because they actually can fight. Unfortunately Pos dreams of learning kung fu dont come with any discernible talent. Big eater though. Meanwhile Tai Lung (McShane) a snow leopard passed over for Dragon Warrior years before - resulting in a tantrum of destructive proportions - has broken out of prison and is intent on revenge. Can Po become a true warrior in time? Dont answer that. Anyone who has ever seen a movie or read a book or heard a bedtime story knows where the plot is headed. Kung Fu Panda isnt the kind of movie that will make you gasp with surprise as it moves toward its believe-in-yourself destination. But it is the kind of movie that will make you enjoy the journey. Thats due in large part to Black. In live-action films his tendency to be overbearing - unless its specifically called for as in The School of Rock - wears thin quickly. In fact at this point his reputation precedes him. If we see that hes in a film its exhausting just knowing hes going to show up. Not here. Animation is a sure cure for mugging. In addition Po knows his shortcomings and realizes that he isnt a traditional martial-arts hero a truth that keeps him grounded for the most part. But theres one thing that drives Po hunger as befits a creature of his um stature. Master Shifu recognizes this and uses it to teach Po in the ways of the Dragon Warrior. Hoffman is effective allowing Master Shifus emotions to grow from shocked to angry to befuddled; finally he accepts Oogways decision (although its never made clear whether the old turtle really knew what he was talking about). Animation suits Hoffman as well; after the dreadful Mr. Magoriums Wonder Emporium he too finds benefit in toning things down. Certainly theres more nuance in his performance in Kung Fu Panda than in anything he did in Magorium. But its McShane who really shines as Tai Lung the snow leopard. Fans of Deadwood will see and hear little bits of the infamous Al Swearengen in McShanes performance evil leavened by dark sometimes self-deprecating humor. The animation is first-rate and the settings and background are appropriately exotic. The fights are a lot more exciting than you would think. And if the story is somewhat predictable (and the final blow somewhat difficult to fathom) one could find lesser heroes to root for than Po although none more unlikely.

"Kung Fu} - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Kung Fu Kung Fu}cover storyJune 6 2008|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticPo dreams of being a great martial artist. He longs to have skills ""an awesome aura so awesome his enemies would go blind from overdoses of pure awesomeness""If only he can break free of his ""place in the world"" his dads noodle shop. Po wants to bust a move.But Po is a panda. He can take a licking sure. But hed rather be licking a noodle bowl dipping into the dim sum. Hes into Kung Fu. Hes even more into Kung Pao.Kung Fu Panda gives Po the voice of Jack Black and turns the roly-poly Black loose in a comedy that mocks and embraces every martial-arts-movie tradition in the book. Wacky and wise to the ways of the movies it parodies its an 85-minute animated stitch.Things are peaceful in the Valley of Peace too peaceful. The great enemy of that peace Tai Lung (Ian McShane does his voice) is a snow leopard guarded by legions of armored rhinos in the most secure prison anywhere. And when Tai Lung breaks out disturbing the peace of the Valley of Peace is the only thing that will give Tai Lung peace.Enter Po. Or actually ""The Furious Five"" the greatest students of Master Yoda um Shifu (Dustin Hoffman as a tiny red panda). They are the hope of the valley and the lead candidates to be named The Dragon Warrior to be allowed to read The Dragon Scroll ""the secret to unlimited power""Po crashes the naming ceremony and oddly is named ""the chosen one."" He will be the martial artist who defends the valley against Tai Lung which irks the ""Five"" -- Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Mantis (Seth Rogen) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Viper (Lucy Liu) and Crane (David Cross) -- no end.""You dont belong here"" they say predictably. But Po is just tickled to meet his idols.""Wow you guys are so much bigger than your action figures. Uh except for you Mantis. Youre about the same.""The master must understand the inscrutable reasons Po was chosen and train his new student. Po must master his appetites and prove himself worthy.And the Five must fend off Tai Lung long enough for Po to be prepared for the showdown.Half the fun in Kung Fu Panda is the way Black Hoffman and others hurl themselves into their voice roles. Legendary Chinese-American character actor James Hong lends vast credibility to Pos Father Goose. Except that Po doesnt want to hear Dads ""We are noodle folk Broth runs through our veins"" McShane has the growl of a hundred classic Disney cartoon villains.The movie seems tailored to Blacks talents and frankly girth. Po is one big porky panda joke a joke told by a guy given to geeky fanboy riffs.The other half of the fun is the ways Kung Fu Panda toys with martial-arts movie conventions. The fights are epic brawls defying gravity space and time (lots of slow-motion punches kicks and faces contorted into screams). The martial-arts styles (crane monkey etc.) are personified in the animals that represent them. The chopstick ""duel over the dumplings"" a training exercise that keeps Po from his dim sum is cleverly mimicked in a later fight with Po on bamboo stilts.The violence is a bit much for an animated film. The MPAA ratings board snoozed through Prince Caspian and was a little groggy on this one.But the animation is stunning with an opening 2-D dream sequence that harks back to the glory days of Mulan. Animating a tubby sack of fur couldnt have been easy but Po is almost City Zoo real and School of Rock funny.And any parent can get on board with these messages about ""following your destiny."" ""The mark of a true hero is humility.""It takes an Oscar winner (Hoffman) to sell this chestnut -- ""Yesterday is history tomorrow is a mystery today is a gift. Thats why they call it the present. "" But so is this movie a gift in a summer that threatens to be seriously short of quality kid entertainment.

For this new Ghostbusters director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids) working with his regular screenwriter Katie Dippold has dropped the deadpan blue-collar schlubbiness of Murray and the gang. But he adds a sharp sense of sorority turning this rethink into something appealing on its own terms.

"Review `Kung Fu Panda a bright surprise | 6abc.com GO Personalize your weather by entering a location. Sorry but the location you entered was not found. Please try again. Sections Traffic Video PhiladelphiaPennsylvaniaNew JerseyDelaware Home AccuWeather Traffic Video Photos Apps Local News PhiladelphiaPennsylvaniaNew JerseyDelaware Shows Follow Us Review `Kung Fu Panda a bright surprise June 4 2008 71048 PM PDT June 4 2008 -- Ah the panda. Theres no cuter member of the animal kingdom so why has he taken so long to land a starring role in Hollywood? The truth is we like our cartoons to be the less attractive eccentrics mice rats whatever Gonzo is. But in ""Kung Fu Panda"" Jack Blacks panda isnt cuddly; hes an overweight dreamer who has more in common with Nacho Libre than Hsing-Hsing. He puts the giant in giant panda. The adaptation of such a delicate creature to the summer blockbuster habitat - a zoo if ever there was one - could have resulted in a bloated bore of a film. But ""Kung Fu Panda"" is surprisingly fun and light. Its also easily the best DreamWorks computer animation yet far surpassing the look of ""Madagascar"" or even ""Shrek"" - not quite on Pixars level but close. ""Kung Fu Panda"" begins with a stylish brilliantly colored dream in which Po (Black) imagines hes part of the Furious Five a group of elite kung fu fighters. They are like a Noahs Ark of warriors Angelina Jolie is Tigress (who looks a bit like Tony the Tigers sister); Seth Rogen is Mantis an insect whose skills exceed his size; David Cross is the bird Crane; Lucy Liu is the snake Viper; and Jackie Chan is Monkey whose species you can guess. When Po wakes up though hes far from their ranks and cant even conquer a flight of stairs. Hes the son of a noodle shop owner a goose voiced by James Hong. How a bird fathered a panda is a genealogy jokingly alluded to in ""Kung Fu Panda"" but never resolved. ""I dont dream about noodles Dad"" Po says. ""I love kung fu."" The Furious Five are led by the Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) whose own guru the turtle Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) fears their nemesis Tai Lung (Ian McShane) will return and destroy their Chinese valley. All Oogway wants like Loretta Lynn is peace in the valley. Their Chinese town is populated by pigs and geese and no humans which might sound like an updated ""Animal Farm."" But the closest thing here to Big Brother is an old turtle. To defend them Oogway must find the ""Dragon Warrior"" to fulfill an ancient prophecy. As you might guess Po is unexpectedly thrust into this role despite any evidence of talent and the movie is essentially about whether he can live up to this destiny. The plot is standard martial arts stuff but at every turn the serious gravity of the kung fu archetype is contrasted by the extreme oafishness of Po. Take for example this lesson bestowed on Po by Shifu ""Panda we do not wash our pits in the Sea of Forgotten Tears."" Hes plucky but its not Pos grit thats endearing; its his casual good-naturedness. The Furious Five resent his undeserved opportunity but when they crush him in training Po ever the fan collects the rubble as a souvenir. Though most around him have no sense of humor Po disarms them with his lack of intensity. His name after all means the soul materialized. The fool in over his head is far from a new story but ""Kung Fu Panda"" finds life in the old gag. The elaborate fight sequences (a memorable one is with chop sticks) are as inventive as anything in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon."" But the comedy of ""Kung Fu Panda"" lies in the deadpan looks and perfect pauses. Co-directors Josh Stevenson and Mark Osborne both animation vets helming a major film for the first time ensure that the comic timing is exact and that their cartoon creations have well-animated eyes. The right eye-roll (and there are many) always trumps a punchline. The voice work is good all around particularly from Black McShane and Hoffman whose part as tiny guru - a red panda - takes on a shade of Obi-Wan Kenobi with an attitude. Jolie is entirely forgettable but its surely a sign of success that the A-listers recede as the movie rolls. The most enjoyable character though is a small supporting role voiced by Dan Fogler (""Balls of Fury""). As the palace envoy Zeng hes a Muppet-like bird so jittery that no flap of his wings is without hazard. As summer movies get bigger and bigger they often make us the audience feel smaller and smaller. The bright ""Kung Fu Panda"" is a simple and lighthearted exception. ""Kung Fu Panda"" a DreamWorks Animation SKG and Paramount Pictures release is rated PG for sequences of martial arts action. Running time 91 minutes. Three stars out of four.

Black gets off a few good lines (""Oooo my tenders"" he exclaims when Po is bashed in the crotch) but he doesnt make crazy full use of his wild side -- the eager riffing glee he has shown in films like School of Rock. Instead Black taps a quality that isnt so visible when he pops his eyes with mock ferocity on screen. He gives Po a slightly abashed suburban-couch-potato sweetness. Po who works in his fathers noodle shop dreams of kung fu glory and it certainly seems preposterous that this lazy soft-bodied bear would attain it. But after causing an accidental fireworks display in the Jade Palace where the Furious Five -- Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Crane (David Cross) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Viper (Lucy Liu) and Mantis (Seth Rogen) -- are showing off their twirly whip-cracking moves Po is decreed to be the Dragon Warrior and he starts to train with the Furious Five. Thats when Kung Fu Panda ignites. As Master Shifu the groups Fu Manchu-mustached raccoon of a karate-kid guru Dustin Hoffman his voice a-growl has a wonderful persnickety surliness. Its as if Yoda were being played by Burt Lancaster. Pos total lack of skill is quite funny -- hes such a flabby compendium of wrong moves that even his screwups have a bass-ackwards logic that is nearly balletic. But then Master Shifu figures out how to teach this hopeless case the art of kung fu. He uses a bowl of dumplings which Po is so eager to eat that hell scramble anywhere at any speed to get at them. Kung Fu Panda is light and goofy yet the fight scenes which are the heart of the film are lickety-split mad fun. Just about all animated movies teach you to Believe in Yourself (the rat who finds the courage to cook The ogre who learns to love) but the image of a face-stuffing panda-turned-yowling Bruce Lee dervish is as unlikely and touching an advertisement for that message as weve seen in quite some time.

Hectic as ever Jack Black voices Po a potbellied panda whos stuck making noodles with dad (a goose--for reasons that escape me--voiced by James Hong) even though he lives and breathes kung fu trivia and longs to become a Master. The call comes from Dustin Hoffman as a pint-sized Zen guru under whose grumpy tutelage Po and five other trainee critters with famous voices band together to save the world from a disgruntled snow leopard (Ian McShane). The movies design is striking the colors are gorgeous and the fight sequences are pretty suave--but the adorability quotient is set a little high for this jaded palate. And is there a child around the moviegoing globe who couldnt lip-sync by now the smug sloganeering about following your bliss playing to your strengths and learning to be a mensch in good times and bad? Department of small mercies For once the moral voice (or ""takeaway"" as its excruciatingly called in the production notes) comes more out of Buddhism than the Protestant work ethic. So were talking smash hit in Marin County and Dharamsala.

"Kung-Fu Panda | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; kung-fu-panda ) Kung-Fu Panda (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Kung Fu Panda adopts a different less zany tone than one might expect from a movie with that title especially considering that Jack Black has been brought on board to provide the lead voice. While it would be unfair to say that the movie doesnt present its share of comedic moments the animated production as a whole jettisons non-stop jokiness in favor of something a little more serious. Thus Kung Fu Panda ends up presenting a message about believing in oneself that might not have come across as successfully had it tended toward outright fatuousness. The film is set in and around Chinas Valley of Peace where there are no humans only talking animals. Po the Panda (voice of Black) spends his time daydreaming about being a martial arts hero when hes not working for his father (James Hong) making and serving noodle soup. Meanwhile at a nearby temple the head monk Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) has had a vision that the power-mad Tia Lung (Ian McShane) will escape from prison and ravage the Valley in his quest for dominance. To stop this Oogway must discern the one who deserves to become the Dragon Warrior. There are five obvious candidates all apprentices to Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Viper (Lucy Liu) Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen). Yet as the result of a seemingly random series of events Oogway chooses Po. This comes as a surprise not only to an outraged Shifu but to his pupils as well. The thought of Po confronting Tia Lung is laughable since the fat panda has trouble making it to the top of the temples stairs. But as must be the case for the movie to have any traction Po has hidden talents that Shifu is able to discover and unlock even as time grows short. The film contains plenty of martial arts action and without the constraints of needing live action actors its able to play fast and loose with the laws of physics. There are nods to the fighting styles of Jackie Chan and Jet Li as well as homages to the wire-fu and computer enhanced approaches used in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and The Matrix. This is mixed and matched with a cartoonishness that often seems closer to the fighting in the old Batman TV series than to that in any ""serious"" kung fu movie. From Pos training to Tia Lungs prison escape to the final confrontation Kung Fu Panda keeps things moving and it tells its story in a tidy 90 minutes. This is one summer movie that doesnt feel bloated. The filmmakers get some comedic mileage out of making Po a Kung Fu fanboy. Theres a tongue-in-cheek scene that has him examining artifacts in the temple and revealing the kind of minutia that only a true fan would know. Hes a die-hard Trekkie suddenly set loose on the Enterprise soundstage. For him meeting the Furious Five is a dream come true. Even though hes the legendary Dragon Warrior whose arrival has been greatly anticipated he is awestruck and tongue-tied around Monkey Tigress Viper Crane and Mantis. As Po Jack Black brings his usual mix of puppy dog eagerness and rambunctious humor to the panda. One never forgets that Black is Po - his voice is too distinctive - but thats not a distraction. The reality is that Black plays most of his live-action roles like a cartoon character so this is perfect for him. The other two main parts - Dustin Hoffman as Master Shifu and Ian McShane as Tia Lung - are well-cast. Hoffman brings authority and McShane adds menace and their voices while familiar are not immediately recognizable. After that however its mostly stunt casting. Angelina Jolie doesnt have more than handful of lines so shes in this mainly to add some star power to the cast. Then theres Jackie Chan. Chan is far from an adept enunciator of English but the opportunity to have him on board was probably too good to pass up. The animation is workmanlike which is to say that the characters and settings are nicely rendered but there are no steps forward in technique. Perhaps we have reached a state where the lush detail of computer generated images is no longer eye-popping; it has become expected. If thats the case Kung Fu Panda delivers whats expected. There is one interesting twist the movie opens with a dream sequence that is crudely presented using two-dimensional exaggerated caricatures so when the dream ends and we enter the ""real"" world the contrast is stark. In recent years computer animation has been in the doldrums. While Kung Fu Panda isnt the movie to re-invigorate the genre its made with enough technical savvy and provides sufficient fun (especially for younger viewers) that it should be a major player at the summer box office. Although the basic storyline and moral are standard animated film building blocks Kung Fu Panda contains enough funny material low-key thrills and moments of genuine pathos (a flashback detailing Shifus past connection to Tia Lung) to prevent it from seeming too much like a re-tread. This is a solid family film material although one suspects the children will get a little more out of it than their parents.

How many underdog kidpic characters have been told ""You just need to believe"" in recent years? Whatever the ample number add one more to the list with ""Kung Fu Panda"" a nice looking but heavily formulaic DreamWorks animation entry. The tale of a bumbling pot-bellied black-and-white bear who has greatness thrust upon him when anointed to protect his community the vocally star-laden effort features an abundance of broad buffoonish slapstick that will play perfectly well with kids to desired B.O. effect. But overall mild impact will likely prevent this from joining the top commercial tier of animated attractions. In keeping with the Chinese setting first-time directors John Stevenson and Mark Osborne have gone out of their way to create some beautiful rural backgrounds for the simplistic foreground action so there is always something to distract the eye (beginning with a clever Asian-style DreamWorks logo). But comic inspiration is distinctly lacking in Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Bergers script which delays the dufus metamorphosis into hero for a full hour and largely feels structured to accommodate the maximum amount of action much of which is intended to be funnier than it is. For no reason other than the fact that he accidentally turns up at the right place at the right time roly-poly Po (voiced rambunctiously or obnoxiously per individual taste by Jack Black) is identified by the ancient Yoda-like turtle sage Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) as the long-awaited new Dragon Warrior. Said designation had been expected to go to one of the areas prodigious Furious Five Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Monkey (Jackie Chan) Viper (Lucy Liu) Crane (David Cross) and Mantis (Seth Rogen) all martial arts virtuosos who trained under diminutive wolf Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). Whether or not Po is chosen because Oogway has become senile remains uncertain but what does become clear is that Po once he learns the Secret of the Dragon Scroll will have to battle the fearsome Tai Lung (Ian McShane) a kung fu master so resourceful hes able to escape from a mountain prison manned by 1000 guards. Even he however isnt so much a villain as a creature rejected by the inscrutable Oogway who long ago passed him over when he seemed the natural choice to become Dragon Warrior. Even by moppet-defined standards the situations characters and motivations here are extremely elementary and lack nuance; other than Po and his prescribed transformation none of the other figures reveal dimensions not fully evident at their initial appearances. Scripters are similarly unforthcoming with any dramatic surprises making for a film in which the inevitable climax feels unduly postponed the brief running time notwithstanding. Pic comes to semi-inspired comic life in just one sequence in which Po who thinks hes mastered his kung fu technique duels Shifu with chopsticks over some dumplings. More serious action scenes notably one of the Furious Five battling Tai Lung on a long suspension bridge and the climactic mano a mano are ramped up in conventional fashion and backed by a booming score by Hans Zimmer and John Powell. Filmmakers draw upon Asian art and animation styles as well as mountainous geographic settings inspired by the Li River Valley to create some splendid and unusually detailed widescreen CG images. Color is used carefully to pop dramatically at key moments helping make the visuals the most sophisticated aspect of the otherwise mild accomplishment. Aside from Blacks overbearing readings voiceover work ranges from solid to tasty with the latter including Hoffmans sly shadings for the master teacher McShanes injection of unexpected feeling into his impersonation of a scorned would-be champion and Kims over-the-hill intimations for the past-his-prime sage. Star names for the Furious Five have relatively few vocal opportunities to shine. Kung Fu PandaProductionA Paramount release of a DreamWorks Animation SKG presentation. Produced by Melissa Cobb.
