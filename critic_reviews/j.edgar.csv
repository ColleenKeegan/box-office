Just as Hoover operated in the shadows of Washington for more than 50 years so Eastwoods film exists in the half-dark he and writer Dustin Lance Black (Milk) flit between the beginning of Hoovers career in the 1920s and its twilight in the 1960s always returning to the muted brown tones and sombre ambience of his office. Faces are half-lit and rooms feel starved of sun. Hoovers character too struggles to remain obscured from the glare of truth.J Edgar is also smart enough to cast a shadow over hard facts. Versions of events remain versions a viewpoint stressed by the framing device of Hoover narrating his unreliable memoirs to younger FBI agents. The film is more interested in offering a thoughtful character study than delivering hard-and-fast reconstructions. It gives us Leonardo DiCaprio first fresh-faced later caked in make-up as Hoover a man of strong moral principles willing to resort to immoral rule-bending to see his will carried out.DiCaprios Hoover is arrogant but nervy quick to lose control emotionally if he loses power in public or private. Its a push-and-pull portrait when it comes to our sympathy. We understand his enthusiasm for forensic science and an FBI run as a meritocracy but recoil at his willingness to blackmail presidents and attempt to persuade Martin Luther King to turn down the Nobel Peace Prize. One can only surmise on Eastwood and Blacks individual opinions of Hoover but one imagines that their perspectives on his long career may complement each other and meet in the middle to offer a biopic that is unusually layered and two-headed. One suspects Eastwood as the more conservative influence on Blacks youthful revisionism.The film is sympathetic both to Hoovers ambition and patriotism and the personal dynamics that defined his character for good or ill. The latter include the love of an overpowering mother played with an Oedipal flirtatiousness by Judi Dench and most provocatively the constant presence of a personal and professional companion Clyde Tolson played by Armie Hammer. Considering some of the wilder accusations thrown at Hoover in the past including orgies and cross-dressing in public the coy hand-holding between Tolson and Hoover and one scene in which he tries on his mothers dress after her death feel respectful and restrained. Were left with a pleasing intelligent film happy to describe Hoovers behaviour as monstrous but too balanced and searching to damn him as a monster.

You dont really feel you get into the depths of J Edgars character - it does remain all very polite. Too much dialogue at times. Prosthetics was the most distracting would have been better if there was an older and younger Edgar. You can really hear Leos young voice and his movements as an old man arent convincing. Hes great in other movies like catch me if you can and the aviator. (not a Leo hater) Didnt find the cinematography all that dynamic either. Perhaps there were budget issues on a lot of these matters but unfortunately it really shows. All is not bad though Naomi Watts is brilliant and very convincing young and old...FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 23 2012Good but weird make-upFeaturedDiCaprio was brilliant as usual but was upstaged by the bizarre make-up. His was quite convincing to be fair but Naomi Watts had a weird turkey neck thing and Armie Hammer - I suppose it was going to be difficult to make him look old because hes just so young and lovely. Performances were good all round but I definitely felt particularly towards the end that things were getting a bit syrupy.

It reminded me the character Citizen Kane in the classic film of the same name directed and starring by Orson Wells seventy years ago considered by many the best American film nominated and winner of Academy Awards. Because of the issue of citizenship the degree of conviction of both characters and how was depicted by bodily mechanical movements that express their ability to have a cold mind. DiCaprio manages to represent his physical contundency even though his height is lower than that of Orsons though had gained some weight for this purpose. I would not be surprised to know that DiCaprio has carefully studied Orsons performance for his characterization of Hoover.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 22 2012AlfredoFeaturedOh the rating...

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 11 2011 600AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English What a sprawling befuddling fascinating frustrating mess of a movie. Usually the tautest of directors Clint Eastwood has gone all slack here allowing his subject to get completely away from him. To be sure J. Edgar Hoover is a big subject and a tough nut to crack. As head of the FBI through eight elected presidents and nearly a half century of American democracy Hoover behaved like a one-man Kremlin as subversive as the subversives he hunted. Eastwood admits as much in these frames but seems to have no strong opinion on the matter. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new Clint Eastwood film ""J. Edgar"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio Movies J. Edgar The official trailer video Video Leonardo DiCaprio transforms into Hoover Instead he gives Hoover a very long leash leaving the little bulldog to bark boastingly and trot across the decades relatively unscathed. Its hardly surprising that J. Edgar would lionize himself; whats shocking is that J. Edgar lets him with only modest attempts at correcting the record. The script is by Dustin Lance Black whose previous work for the big screen ( Milk) and the small ( Big Love) has done nothing to prepare us for this rambling affair. His conceit is to have the movie unfold from Hoovers point of view as a semi-reliable narrator. To that end we first see him as an old man during the Kennedy administration dictating his memoirs to an eager clerk. Actually were seeing Leonardo DiCaprio deploying a near-Southern accent and buried beneath a metric tonne of age-inducing latex. DiCaprios portrayal will prove impressive throughout but his splendid performance doubles as a problem. Simply by casting a movie-star hunk in the title role the guy is elevated endowed with a physical grace he didnt possess. Hoover who knew a thing or two about manipulating opinion through the media would have stamped his approval. The memoir gimmick gives the picture its broad structure cross-cutting between the relative present (Sixties Seventies) and various points in the distant past. The earliest is 1919 when with Red Emma Goldman on her soapbox and violence in the streets Hoover finds his anti-Commie credo ""My eyes were opened."" So a wide-eyed hireling in the Justice Department he toils to get Goldman and several hundred others whose crimes were their ideas deported. As a reward at the tender age of 24 Edgar is appointed to lead the new Bureau of Investigation. His beloved mother (Judi Dench) couldnt be prouder. There he promptly sets out vetting prospective agents for moral stains in their character or worse facial hair on their upper lip. There too he hires his life-long secretary Helen Gandy (a barely recognizable Naomi Watts) soon followed by his life-long companion Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). With the help of the woman Edgar begins his practise of assembling ""confidential files"" on the private lives of the powerful; with the man he kick-starts his own private life of shared dinners and endless gossip. Flash-forward again to the Sixties. The dynamic trio have all aged together and courtesy of the makeup department are now similarly layered in latex - in certain light they look like a Night of the Living Dead convention. Nevertheless Edgar remains hard at it butting heads with Bobby Kennedy digging up dirt on Jack and doing his vicious best to discredit Martin Luther King along with that most insidious of domestic threats - the Civil Rights Movement. Back to the past where the Twenties give way to the Thirties Commies to gangsters and then the ""crime of the century"" - the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby. Oddly this is what Eastwood lingers on clumsily dramatizing several aspects of the case all with the apparent purpose of extolling Hoovers law-enforcing achievements (expanding federal jurisdiction advancing forensic science centralizing finger-printing data). While were pondering this the G-man records in his memoir ""Its important that we re-clarify the difference between hero and villain.""Yet thats precisely what this film fails to do. It doesnt convincingly portray Hoover as either a tragic hero with flaws or a villain with redeeming humanity. Consequently despite DiCaprios best efforts the character never comes alive enough to elicit our sympathy or our disdain. Without that investment the so-called emotional scenes play out like a dry well. The death of his mother for example. Hoover is bereft and Eastwood uses the occasion to touch on the cross-dressing rumours. In his grief Edgar dons Mommys necklace then her frock and collapses to the floor in tears. Yes we feel nothing but the urge to laugh - the sequence is risible. So is another crucial moment when Clyde upset about Edgars professed dalliance with an actress dukes it out with his pal then plants a bloody kiss smack on his mouth. On this issue the film is discreet about the extent of Hoovers homosexual feelings - he certainly had them; he may or may not have acted on them. Since Hoover himself lacked any such reservations about exposing the sexual habits (real or rumoured) of others perhaps Eastwoods non-committal approach reflects a commendable higher standard. Unfortunately it also reflects a non-committal picture. The script tries to make a virtue out of not judging Hoover asking us to do the job instead. That might be fine but only if were given a reason to care. We arent. Hoover died in office during the presidency of his star pupil Richard Nixon. They shared the same love of illegal bugging dirty tricks and domestic spying plus the fervent belief that ""information is power."" Well maybe in war and politics but not in the movies. Like its subject J. Edgar is chock full of random information; unlike him its woefully lacking in any real power. The man built a Kremlin in Washington while branding himself a patriot; the film raises a red flag only to hide under it. J.

"J. Edgar review Watching the watcher |       NJ.com comments J. Edgar review Watching the watcher Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 11 2011 at 713 AM View/Post Comments WARNER BROS.Leonardo DiCaprio stars in the title role of ""J. Edgar."" That script was the story of a gay man who came out of the closet and discovered the real politics of joy. This one is the story of a gay man who stayed hidden mired in self-loathing. Because Hoovers suspected homosexuality is not only present here but is the real theme how terrified about keeping his own secret Hoover found a twisted satisfaction in collecting everyone elses. This gets a brief but rich dramatization when Hoover -- in a fierce performance by Leonardo DiCaprio -- is seen dictating an ""anonymous"" hate letter to be sent to Martin Luther King Jr. At vicious length he reviles the leader for his decadence and hypocrisy. But you know hes really addressing himself. This is an interesting insight and you wish the film had more like it. Unfortunately Blacks script is alternately conventional (stagily setting itself up as Hoovers dictated memoirs) and confused (featuring flashbacks within flashbacks). Scenes of Hoover basically inventing the FBI have real force. Other scenes including a bathetic one of Hoover trying on his dead mothers dress are merely awkward attempts to include some gossip that everyone ""knows"" (and which truth be told is pretty unreliable). Actually we know very little about Hoovers private life -- beyond the fact that the committed bachelor had only two close relationships -- with his mother and with devoted aide Clyde Tolson with whom he shared meals (and vacations) for decades. Everyone has their suspicions about the two of course. And you get hints from DiCaprio who also gets the aggressive ambition of the man down pat while never letting the old-age makeup get in the way of his performance (Armie Hammer who plays Tolson and sometimes looks like an extra from ""House of Wax"" is less lucky). The impressions of various politicians however -- RFK Nixon -- never rise above the amateur. And what of Naomi Watts character -- Hoovers slavishly devoted secretary? Whats her motivation in all of this? That Hoover didnt seem to care is unfortunate; that the filmmakers dont either is insulting. And although Hoovers luster faded as his career went on Eastwoods movie seems wan from the start. The colors are deliberately washed out -- as if neutral tones and nostalgia were one and the same. Some green-screen backgrounds of inaugural parades dont convince and a few shots even appear slightly blurred. Eastwood has long been famous for his fast shoots but how much of that is knowing precisely what he wants and how much of it is being willing to settle? Hes been a critical darling for a long time but after this -- and ""Invictus"" and a number of other less-than-stellar films -- its beginning to seem like hes coasting on past glories. Which come to think of it is part of the ""J. Edgar"" story too. Ratings note TWO AND A HALF STARS. The film contains strong language and violence.

Edgar Fails to Investigate Much Eric Snider 11/11/2011 The impression I get from watching J. Edgar is that Leonardo DiCaprio likes the character screenwriter Dustin Lance Black doesnt and director Clint Eastwood couldnt care less either way as long as he can finish making the movie before suppertime. So here you go. Heres that J. Edgar Hoover biopic you asked for or at least something that meets all the technical requirements to be considered one. Hoover served as director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1924 (when it was just the Bureau of Investigation) until his death in 1972 worked under eight different presidents defined and expanded the nature of American law enforcement and was considered by some to be the second most powerful man in the country. His life and career could be the stuff of interesting cinema -- as evidenced by the sequences in the movie that actually are interesting -- but not without shaping the material into a cohesive story and committing to a vision. Eastwood seems content to spread a bunch of facts rumors and innuendos on the table and leave it at that. The film moves back and forth between two general time periods in Hoovers life the 1920s and 30s when hes making a name for himself and the 1960s when hes recounting his lifes work to a series of FBI underlings tasked with transcribing his memoirs. (DiCaprios old-age makeup is pretty impressive as these things go; the other few actors appearing in both eras do not fare quite as well.) A zealous pursuer of criminals and a strict believer in moral uprightness Hoover lives with his mother (Judi Dench) and does not have friends or lovers. With his typical eagerness he clumsily proposes to a Bureau typist Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) who politely refuses him and instead becomes his secretary for the next 40 years. The kidnapping of Charles Lindberghs young son in 1932 motivates Hoover to seek greater powers for the Bureau of Investigation and more resources to examine forensic evidence. Hes gung-ho about fingerprinting which many others in law enforcement consider ""speculative science."" His efforts to solve the case and prove his departments worth lead to other high-profile victories including the capture of prominent bank robbers like John Dillinger and Machine Gun Kelly. In 1935 the departments powers are expanded and the organization is renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Hoover is its first director. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE GAY STUFF?? you are asking. Funny I was going to ask Eastwood the same question. Rumors about Hoovers sexuality were commonplace throughout his life and especially afterward when his money and estate went to longtime friend and fellow FBI agent Clyde Tolson. (Tolson also accepted the U.S. flag draped on Hoovers coffin and was later buried near him.) The movie perhaps not wanting to offend people on either side of the issue hedges its bets. Tolson is played in the film by Armie Hammer the tall strapping Winklevoss from last years The Social Network and his relationship with Hoover looks less like Brokeback Mountain and more like Burns and Smithers. Tolson clearly has eyes only for Hoover; whether (or how much) his affections are reciprocated is where the movie wants to have it both ways. In the movies view Hoover was gay but celibate in love with Tolson but unwilling to act on it or seek love elsewhere. Such a lifestyle is not unheard of but does anyone really think it was J. Edgar Hoovers? And so we have a movie that keeps referencing the subject without really addressing it. Blacks screenplay a mishmash of corny overwrought dialogue conveys that Hoover and Tolson are less-than-hetero by having them gossip cattily about common acquaintances or by showing Hoover comically flustered when Ginger Rogers mother hits on him. The characters have one scene in which to tackle the issue head-on and it turns into a farce of shouting and throwing things. (""Pick up that glass"" Hoover yells after Tolson smashes one against the wall. Tolson yells back ""I have no reason to do that"") They fight they make up Hoover whispers ""I love you"" after Tolman has already left the room -- its a masterpiece of melodramatic hack work. As controversial as it would have been to ignore Hoovers personal life altogether and focus only on his work that might have been better than what this film does which is to focus on his personal life without actually saying anything about it. The FBI material is more intriguing and conveyed with much less ambiguity. The movie might avoid taking a position on Hoovers sexuality but it has no problem painting a clear picture of him as head of the FBI paranoid vindictive narcissistic and self-aggrandizing. Hell start a ""file"" on anyone he doesnt like without even bothering to come up with a pretense. He does some despicable things to his enemies and is only slightly less awful to those he loves. DiCaprio does his best to make the character human but its an uphill battle against a screenplay that hates the guy. Add Eastwoods apathy to that and youve got a long pointless slog of a film.

Edgar Hoovers Life in a Dramatic Vacuum Decades and makeup mount but Eastwood loses his man; planets threat casts a spell in Melancholia Watch a clip of Clint Eastwoods latest film ""J. Edgar"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Video courtesy of Warnerbros. By Joe Morgenstern November 11 2011 As the peerlessly powerful and widely feared director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation over the course of almost five decades J. Edgar Hoover saw himself in a constant state of war--against radicals gangsters Communists and any politicians including presidents who tried to get in his way. ""J. Edgar"" with Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role is at war with itself and everyone loses. Clint Eastwoods investigation of Hoovers life and tumultuous times seeks the cold facts behind the crime-fighter myths the flesh-and-blood man behind the dour demeanor and the rumors of homosexuality. Yet Mr. Eastwoods ponderous direction a clumsy script by Dustin Lance Black and ghastly slatherings of old-age makeup all conspire to put the story at an emotional and historical distance. Its a partially animated waxworks. The productions internal conflict goes beyond style. ""J. Edgar"" is unsparing in its portrait of Hoover as a ruthless self-dramatizing and sometimes delusional zealot--his loathing of Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy among others is given special prominence--as well as a patriot by his own lights and a proponent of modern criminal science. Mr. DiCaprios approach is equally unsparing; the actor declines to spare himself. His Hoover is more to be censured than pitied an obsessive-compulsive creep with the vocal rhythms of a ball-peen hammer and a gimlet-eyed gift for blackmail. At the very same time the movie offers a love story in which the hero struggles with his sexuality and with his supposedly closeted love--if there was a closet it stayed tightly shut so most of the scripts sexual content is conjecture--for Clyde Tolson the FBI agent who came to be known as Hoovers constant companion. Hes played by Armie Hammer who exempt from the cartoonish constraints of Mr. DiCaprios role manages to make Tolson appealing and fitfully interesting. In principle biography should do what ""J. Edgar"" tries to do--reveal an inner life whether or not the subject is outwardly appealing. Theres a certain logic to Mr. Blacks having done the screenplay; he won an Oscar for writing ""Milk"" in which Sean Penn portrayed the gay activist Harvey Milk. This time though his script along with stodgy staging and Tom Sterns cheerless cinematography yields scenes that cross the line from awkward to embarrassing--not because the lovers are gay or getting to be long in the tooth but because theyre written and observed as mawkish relics rather than passionate individuals who speak and behave in the idioms of their day. (In a scene that may be the movies nadir Clydes face falls while his lips literally quiver when Edgar reveals that hes been to dinner several times with Dorothy Lamour that theyve ""become physical"" and that it may finally be time for a Mrs. Hoover.) ENLARGE Leonardo DiCaprio as the titular FBI director in J. Edgar. Warner Brothers Although ""J. Edgar"" spares us the spectacle of a make-believe Lamour its studded with other vignettes and dubious representations of historical figures a charm-free Ginger Rogers a blank-slate Charles Lindbergh a cloddish Robert F. Kennedy and an appallingly crude approximation of Richard Nixon. Perhaps the saddest spectacle representing the worst waste of talent is Naomi Watts as Helen Gandy Hoovers endlessly loyal private secretary. Ms. Watts is stuck with an opaque character dreadful dialogue and during the many sequences set in the twilight of Hoovers career the sort of age makeup that should never deface as lovely a face as hers. Judi Dench fares slightly better as Annie Hoover Edgars mother. Annie may be a fire-breathing religious nut job but at least the actress gets some fire to breathe. Legendary power and its abuse always hold the potential for powerful drama; the trick is in the telling. This latest attempt to tell Hoovers story doesnt lack for ambition only for expertise. Even if the personal side had been sharper and livelier the historical side--partly satirical and partly objective--would have been ill-conceived. (Much of Hoovers career is explicated tediously through the device of him dictating salient details to an FBI biographer and shown confusingly through the cracked prism of his self-inventions.) The script abounds in casual anachronisms--phrases like ""fashion forward"" and ""a P.R. disaster""--and jumps back and forth in time without getting the feel of any period quite right. Fingerprints figured significantly in the bureaus evolution; at first Hoover called them finger patterns or finger imprints. Whatever you want to call the ones that besmudge ""J. Edgar"" theyre evidence of heavy hands. Melancholia ENLARGE Kirsten Dunst as Justine in Melancholia. Magnolia Pictures A few days ago a mountain-size asteroid came close to Earth then zipped safely past it. The threat is more substantial in this hauntingly beautiful drama by the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier. On one level the title refers to the planet Melancholia a vast and mysterious orb that may or may not hit us and put an end to terrestrial life. But ""Melancholia"" which stars Kirsten Dunst isnt really concerned with astronomy or what happens when worlds collide even though the literal drama of an impending apocalypse is evoked with an extraordinary mixture of gravity and grave playfulness. Its true subject is melancholia as a spiritual state a destroyer of happiness that emerges from its hiding place behind the sun just like the menacing planet then holds the heroine Justine in its unyielding grip and gives Ms. Dunst the unlikely occasion for a dazzling performance. Thats an important thing to know about this film. Its about depression but it isnt depressing at all. In the hands of Mr. von Trier himself no stranger to emotional distress bedazzlement is depressions surprising byproduct. Justine uses melancholia as a refuge from a world that gives her no joy but when she first shows up for her elaborate wedding shes in a manic state at once alluring and alarmingly funny that suggests the sort of screwball comedy graced in an earlier time by Carole Lombard or Katharine Hepburn. Watch a clip of ""Melancholia"" starring Kirsten Dunst. Two sisters find their already strained relationship challenged as a mysterious new planet threatens to collide into the Earth. Video courtesy of Magnolia Pictures. Another important thing to know is that ""Melancholia"" stands apart or should be allowed to stand apart from the stupid things the filmmaker said about Hitler and the Nazis at the Cannes Film Festival and from such provocative but offputting films of the recent past as ""Dogville"" and ""Antichrist."" This new one is certainly flawed--Im not sure that Mr. von Trier was sure how to end it--and the tone can be pretentious even silly. But its disarmingly earnest at the same time and rendered in such stunning images as a Marienbad-like expanse of lawn (the exteriors were shot on Swedens western coast); an overhead shot of Justine and her sister Claire (a fine performance by Charlotte Gainsbourg) on horseback galloping along a country road through layers of fog; and Justine lying naked in the woods beneath the planet Melancholias baleful glow. (Most of the exquisite sound track is excerpted from Richard Wagners score for the opera ""Tristan und Isolde."") A caveat may be in order for those who dislike nervous hand-held cameras. The nervousness may be justified as an expression of the instability of Justines world but this camera does dart spin and swoop as it tracks the orbits of a singularly anxious group of people. The excellent cast includes Charlotte Rampling as Justines angry depressive mother; John Hurt as her childish mercurial father; Alexander Skarsgard as her immature husband-to-be; Alexanders father Stellan Skarsgard as her loathsome boss; and Kiefer Sutherland as Claires husband John a country gentleman who gives rationalism a bad name. Justines mother who has no faith in marriage or anything else tells her sarcastically ""Enjoy it while it lasts."" She would if she could. Justine would enjoy all the pleasures that life offers if she could but she cant. What she can and does do is embrace melancholia and Melancholia with a deep serenity that could pass for being happy. The FBI Story (1959) J. Edgar Hoover plays himself in a cameo role but doesnt get screen credit. He has received extensive credit however for making sure that every frame of this epic ode--the running time is 149 minutes--reflected the glories of the bureau as he saw them and of his reign. The film was directed by Mervyn LeRoy from a steadfastly admiring script by Richard L. Breen and John Twist. James Stewart stars as agent John Michael ""Chip"" Hardesty. The cast includes Vera Miles Nick Adams and Larry Pennell. Clyde Tolson gets screen credit as an unnamed FBI agent. Once (2006) Glen Hansards street musician listed in the credits only as the Guy fixes Hoover vacuums when he isnt writing brilliant songs or singing them on the streets of Dublin. Marketa Irglova who was 17 when the movie was shot plays the Girl. Shes got spunk to spare speaks with a slightly extraterrestrial accent sings with no accent at all writes her own splendid songs and miracle of miracles has a Hoover that needs repair. In one of the films many singular sequences she trails her ailing vacuum cleaner like a blue dog on a hose through Dublins streets. Cinderella Man (2005) A Hooverville--a Depression-era homeless encampment named after the discredited president--provides one of the settings in Ron Howards celebration of James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) a classic underdog who took the heavyweight championship from the lethal supposedly invincible Max Baer in 1935. Its ""Raging Bull"" minus the rage though with a motivation thats at least as involving and a lot more surprising. Unable to find a job that will put food on the table the has-been boxer draws new strength and courage from his love for his family. Braddocks wife is played by Renee Zellweger. 21 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Edgar starring Leonardo DiCaprio movie review Save for later Saved J. Edgar starring Leonardo DiCaprio draws a portrait of the FBI founder as riven and repressed but misses his real substance. By Peter Rainer Film critic November 9 2011 Save for later Saved Leonardo DiCaprio portrays J. Edgar Hoover in a scene from J Edgar. Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Clint Eastwoods ""J. Edgar"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio is an old-style biopic with new-style content. As much as it tries to encompass the full career of FBI founder J. Edgar Hoover from 1919 until his death in 1972 the film inexorably turns on Hoovers alleged homosexuality based on the lifelong bachelors 40-plus-year close friendship with his second in command Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). Call it ""Brokeback Bureau.""Theres nothing sensationalistic about this approach. On the contrary Eastwood and his screenwriter Dustin Lance Black who wrote the Oscar-winning script for ""Milk"" which was about gay activist Harvey Milk deliberately avoid the sort of scurrilousness that Hoover himself often favored in exposing the dark secrets (or trumped-up secrets) of his targets. ""J. Edgar"" is a lot fairer to Hoover than he was to his many enemies - real or imagined.But fairness here is often indistinguishable from wishy-washiness. Its relatively easy to portray Hoover in fairly sympathetic terms if you exclude or play down as this film does his more noxious legacies - especially his use of FBI-paid provocateurs during the civil rights era and his hounding of Martin Luther King Jr. (Few blacks served in the FBI during Hoovers 48-year run as director.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? A portion of the King material is in the film but like much else its essence is sexual rather than political Hoover didnt like the fact that King was adulterous. (Eastwood actually has Hoover when he gets the news that JFK is assassinated listening to a secret tape of King having illicit sex) This sort of depiction defangs the fuller political implications of the story. What we get instead is mostly a film about a sexually walled-in powermonger who detested those who would take power from him. (In only one of many such examples he rapidly marginalizes G-man Melvin Purvis after Purvis becomes a national hero for capturing John Dillinger.) Hoover who narrates the film and often serves as an unreliable witness comes across as a monumentally petty megalomaniac - not exactly the stuff of tragedy. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? How believable is DiCaprio? When I first heard he had been cast as Hoover I couldnt think of another actor physically less likely to pull it off. But hes surprisingly good - especially and even more surprisingly in the many sequences of him as an older man. As the young Hoover whose ardent hatred of Bolshevik radicals propels him into law enforcement DiCaprio is a bit flat. Its as if the actor was waiting for a chance to move beyond the early-years exposition and get to the meat of the role. The gist of ""J. Edgar"" is almost entirely psychological. Hoover is portrayed in stark Freudian terms as a mamas boy who lived with his martinet matriarch Annie (Judi Dench) for most of his life. He fears her wrath more than the wrath of the eight presidents he served (most of whom feared  him - because of the secret files he kept on them). The films most disquieting scene comes when Annie intuiting that her son might be gay tells him ""Id rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a son."" Hoover takes this warning to heart. Although his relationship with Tolson is clearly depicted as a case of repressed longing the key word here is repressed. When Tolson finally breaks down in a jealous fit and kisses Hoover full on the mouth and tells him he loves him Hoover seems alternately baffled and disgusted and enthralled. But there is no danger in the movies terms that Hoover will act on his impulses. Hes a man who ultimately doesnt trust anybody and the script implies that this was so because he couldnt trust himself.The films back-and-forth flashback structure is cumbersome and points up the disparity between the thinness of the scenes of the early years which include the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and the somewhat dense and clotted material of the later years. Eastwood himself provides the spare lachrymose piano score with - inexplicably - snatches of Bachs ""Goldberg Variations"" woven in. All this shape-shifting is intended to make us comprehend if not admire a sacred monster - a worthy companion to Orson Welless Charles Foster Kane.It comes across instead as a form of special pleading. Hoovers early and real accomplishments as a forensic pioneer are not what this film is celebrating. Its greatest sympathies are for a man whose psyche was so riven and repressed that he turned himself into a raging cipher - a nowhere man. The foundation of this sympathy is Hoovers complicated sexuality. Eastwood and Black have attempted to provide Hoover with the balm he denied himself in his own lifetime. It doesnt work.

Edgar beats the heart of a love story. The movies inseparable couple dined and traveled together nearly every day for the better part of 50 years. One was perhaps the most powerful person in the country. Both were men.FBI titan J. Edgar Hoovers close relationship with his right-hand man Clyde Tolson is far more substantiated than tales of Hoovers cross-dressing. As played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Armie Hammer written by Dustin Lance Black and directed by Clint Eastwood that relationship gives J. Edgar an essential human element and an antidote to biopic bloat.Not that J. Edgar is particularly slender. At 137 minutes it covers an awful lot of ground from the 19-year-old Hoovers awakening as a communist hunter after synchronized anarchist bombings in 1919 rocked the country to his death in 1972. But the movie moves well and looks fantastic. Eastwood and Black deftly cut back and forth through time to weigh Hoovers moral and ethical monomania against the highs and lows of a controversial 48-year career at the helm of the FBI and its predecessor the Bureau of Investigation.""Balance"" is a pretty boring word when it comes to drama but its also a crucial quality in the biopic world. Conventional wisdom holds that Hoover was a power-mad monster and hypocrite whose bureau never left a phone unbugged and did its best to derail the civil rights movement. But he also revolutionized criminal forensics -- he was an early fingerprinting pioneer -- and he brought the FBI into modernity. No historical figure is all good or bad; the trick is to take the mix of qualities and make it compelling.J. Edgar does a little more than that. In delineating the events that could turn an idealistic young man into a bitter and self-aggrandizing opportunist it strikes some minor-key echoes of Citizen Kane (including an homage to Kanes famous one-man-clapping scene at Susan Alexanders opera debacle). Without growing overly schematic the movie shows how a stubborn patriot with a withholding mother (Judi Dench) might become J. Edgar Hoover.DiCaprio and Hammer do first-rate work playing Hoover and Tolson through youth and old age. (Give an assist to makeup artist Sian Grigg.) We expect this kind of thing from DiCaprio He always burrows deep into character. Here hes best as the elder Hoover his eyes hollowed out unsure whether to believe his own litany of self-promotional lies. J. Edgar ends up having up some wicked fun with the idea of unreliable narration.The real revelation here is Highland Park-raised Hammer who shot to prominence last year as the privileged Winklevoss twins of The Social Network. Eyes twinkling with confidence Hammer imbues Tolson with seductive confidence and loyalty. Outside Hoovers somewhat cowed personal secretary (Naomi Watts) Tolson provides the only real interpersonal attachment in the kingpins world.Black who won an Oscar for writing the very out romance at the heart of Milk conjures the pain of a love that dare not speak its name. Theres nothing cheap or tawdry about the romance in J. Edgar no wild speculation or prancing lingerie scenes. There is a touch of heartbreak especially as the elderly Hoover and Tolson look after each other as an old married couple might.In leaving enough to the imagination the relationship provides ballast for an epic and frequently shameful life story. J. Edgar takes a man who was clearly no saint and makes him if not sympathetic then at least very human.J.

Edgar Hoover was the most powerful man in America who Americans didnt really know.Hoover built the modern-day Federal Bureau of Investigation incorporating what are now standard policing and forensic techniques into the bureaus work. But at the same time he created what amounted to a private secret police compiling files on all his ""enemies"" that he used to intimidate or at least influence much of official Washington -- up to and including eight different presidents. If knowledge is power Hoover had absolute power and no qualms about using it. In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers El Bulli Cooking In Progress Immortals Immortals 3D Into the Abyss J. Edgar Jack and Jill Le Havre Like Crazy Melancholia Interviews with the stars hot new trailers Hoover lived behind the mask of public relations creating a carefully crafted persona that made him a national hero (at least until his later days). The real man -- the one who apparently lived a life of tortured secrecy and sexual denial the one who was petty and vindictive -- lived in the shadows beyond the view of Americans who saw him as a defender of all things dear to the country.The new ""J. Edgar"" makes a valiant effort to shine light on the real Hoover. It is directed with restraint by Clint Eastwood from an ambitious script by Lance Dustin Black an Oscar winner for ""Milk"" and features a performance by Leonardo DiCaprio as Hoover that can only be called courageous. It is never less than intriguing and often entertaining but in the end it is more noble failure than true success.Advertisement The film is built around Hoover dictating his version of his life story to a young agent (he is not very trustworthy when it comes to the truth) shortly before his death in 1972. It jumps sometimes a bit uneasily from period to period in 20th-century American history beginning with the Red Scare ""Palmer Raids"" of 1919 and 1920 and touching on the early days of the bureau the Lindbergh kidnapping the war on John Dillinger and Pretty Boy Floyd the Kennedys and the civil rights movement (Hoover saw it as a communist conspiracy).The young Hoover is a straight-arrow aide to Attorney General Mitchell Palmer. His life is molded largely by his smothering mother (Judi Dench in an underwritten role that she barely keeps from falling into stereotype) who sees her son as the familys ticket back to prominence.Even early on there are hints -- which will become more than hints later in the film -- that Hoover was a closeted gay whose relationships with women were tortured at best.The only woman other than his mother to play a significant role in his life was his loyal secretary Helen Gandy (a very good Naomi Watts) who worked with him from the first days of the bureau to the time of his death.Perhaps the most important person in his life though appears when charged with reforming the bureau Hoover starts interviewing new potential agents. Clyde Tolson is a smart fashion-conscious upwardly mobile law school graduate whose very presence makes Hoover break out in a sweat. Tolson -- played with nuance and considerable charm by Armie Hammer (""The Social Network"") in what may be the films best performance -- would become Hoovers companion for life. Although there is absolutely no evidence the two men had a physical relationship Blacks script and Eastwoods shrewd direction suggests a lot of unfulfilled desires.Hammer and DiCaprio carry off the homoerotic moments with considerable chemistry and a scene set in a hotel room where Tolson finally explodes at Hoover for not being able to express his sexual desires is one of the best in the movie.As it rolls out much of the film works very well. With the help of crack makeup artists DiCaprio manages to largely pull off Hoover over the decades. (Hes actually better as the aging Hoover than the younger one.) Eastwood has a sure touch for period details and for crafting individual scenes. Cinematographer Tom Stern (an Eastwood regular) uses light and shadow beautifully.But the film breaks down in a tonal conflict between director and writer. Eastwood maintains a studious stance on Hoover staging scenes too discreetly and with too much restraint. Blacks script on the other hand has a very opinionated view of the man with an edge of satire in some of the key scenes. At times notably in a scene that references rumors of Hoovers cross-dressing the two approaches work together; too often they do not.In the end the strain between the two styles is too much for the film as a whole and it falters if not fails.For all its virtues -- or perhaps because of them -- ""J. Edgar"" is a disappointment.J.

Edgar REVIEW In the title role of Clint Eastwoods portrait of one of the most admired and feared figures in U.S. government Leonardo DiCaprio turns in his most fully realized performance.  |  out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT November 11 2011 -- 1124am Video (0343)  Expect Leonardo DiCaprio to get several Oscar nominations for his portrayal of the FBIs J. Edgar Hoover. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Clint Eastwoods ""J. Edgar"" starts with a bang worthy of a Dirty Harry movie. Then it turns as ambiguous and challenging as ""Unforgiven"" or ""Letters From Iwo Jima."" This far-from-perfect film is hobbled by uneven performances and a script studded with historical bullet points. But its a strong tribute to Eastwoods personal vision. What other superstar risks his commercial standing so often to create movies indifferent to the bidding of the box office? In the bravura opening sequence an anarchist bomb rocks the home of Woodrow Wilsons Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer. Palmer retaliating forcefully places Hoover a methodical young Justice Department lawyer in charge of a coordinated effort to gather intelligence about those responsible. Hoover organizes raids on thousands of suspected anarchists arresting many simply for their radical ideas. Rebuked for his overzealous actions Palmer left public life the following year. Hoover stayed in power for half a century. As director of the FBI he became one of the most admired and feared figures in U.S. government protecting the nation while subverting its constitutional freedoms and sabotaging the civil rights movement. ""J. Edgar"" offers a portrait of the man in full giving Leonardo DiCaprio his most challenging and fully realized role. Hoover was a contradictory figure who amassed blackmail-worthy material about his opponents extramarital affairs while shrouding the nature of his deep relationship with his right-hand man and life partner Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). He acted out of high idealism and base egotism. He sought attention but rejected scrutiny. Whether hes playing Edgar the eager keyed-up rising star or the exhausted hollow-eyed old man DiCaprio is pitch-perfect. Once youre past the shock of seeing him in old- age makeup you never have to suspend disbelief. In an early scene young Edgar takes office typist Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) on an awkward first date. They visit the hushed gloomy Library of Congress where he has devised a filing system organizing the holdings. Bursting with pride he asks her to imagine files on every U.S. citizen. Then in a hilariously gauche move he bluntly proposes. Sensing that knowledge and power are this mans aphrodisiacs she declines but remains his secretary and confidante. Throughout the film Hoover steps into the harsh bleaching light then retreats into murk. Warner Bros Keith Bernstein Leonardo DiCaprio as J. Edgar Hoover in ""J. Edgar."" The screenplay by ""Milk"" Oscar winner Dustin Lance Black is a hectic affair shuttling between the mid-1960s and the early days of Hoovers career. Its more a personal story than a political one; the scope of the national police force that Hoover created rarely registers. His kingdom seems to consist of an imposing office and a few men in fedoras. His private life is richly rendered however. Judi Dench dominates every scene as Annie Hoover a controlling matriarch with a perpetual hard stare. She seems to tap into a deep strain of masochism in her son clasping him to her bosom and teaching him to do a stiff fox trot then bullying him with stories of a schoolboy who committed suicide after being exposed as a cross-dresser. Not since ""Psycho"" has a boy been so conflicted about his mother. The other costars make a fleeting impression (Watts is wasted in her underwritten role) or a poor one (Hammer is fine as the flirtatious young Tolson but disastrous once he affects a layer of latex aging makeup and a palsied walk). ""J. Edgar"" functions best as a platform for DiCaprio who captures Hoovers squat heavy physicality his rapid-fire radio announcer style of speech and above all his tightly repressed inner turmoil. The film suggests that Hoovers campaign against what he considered the moral chaos of modern American life was yet another case of a man in power decrying the very behavior that represents his own insecurities. DiCaprios performance gives us the tragedy of a man at war with himself.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 If only Clint Eastwoods J. Edgar had been a little more camp - a goosed-up biopic about the law enforcement bulldog who served under six presidents (famously at odds with many of them) who chased down Bolsheviks and Reds was a shameless headline-grabber a closeted homosexual and maybe a cross-dresser too. More about J. Edgar >> Commie (Hatin) Dearest anyone? Alas Eastwood deploying a roulette wheel of narrative devices (flashbacks flash forwards voice-overs) and a platoon or two of makeup artists (Liver spots Receding hairlines Jowls Midriffs) has opted to play his J. Edgar Hoover story straight so to speak. Notwithstanding the overwrought oedipal exchanges between Leonardo DiCaprios Edgar and his mother (played with stony scowl by Judi Dench) notwithstanding the panic attack Hoover experiences as hes propositioned by a party girl in a Stork Club banquette and notwithstanding the crazy lovers spat between the FBI chieftain and his assistant director Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) J. Edgar is an arduous trek through the history books a gloomy glide down the marble halls of a Washington institution. Most disappointing Eastwoods decades-spanning portrait reveals little about the man himself Edgar John Edgar ""Speedy"" - call him what you will as written by Dustin Lance Black (Milk) and embodied by DiCaprio Hoover comes across as thumbnails from a history book rather than a man realized whole. We see him at various stages of life and career teeming with grand notions of forensic science proudly guiding a young bureau secretary through the card catalogs he devised for the Library of Congress butting heads with the Kennedys and digging up dirt (obsessively) on Martin Luther King. But in the end its hollow stuff. DiCaprio often slathered in aging makeup other times playing Hoover with boyish officiousness never cracks the inner life of the man. You see the actor struggling to conjure the real J. Edgar but theres too much liquid latex to fight through and not enough insight and nuance in the script. Hammer who played the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network likewise suffers from the weight of prosthetics and a problematic screenplay. Really what Eastwood made here is a love story - the tale of two men who took to each other immediately who lunched together daily and spent their holidays in adjoining hotel suites. Of course its the Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name and its evidence of the powerful vengeful FBI boss hypocrisy Hoover equated homosexuals with Communists he forbade his agents to partake of intoxicants he bugged the boudoirs of powerful politicians engaged in illicit acts and yet here he is swilling champagne gambling and gamboling with the FBIs second in command. Eastwood 81 now happily shows no signs of slowing down - hes made 10 movies these last 10 years including the Oscar-winning Million Dollar Baby the searing Letters From Iwo Jima and his ambitious meditation on fate and death Hereafter. And he continues to surprise His approach to J. Edgar (yes he even has DiCaprio pulling on a dress) is daring debunking. I just wish it had been deeper. Or if not that then at least a whole lot more fun. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Jones Jr_Jones J. Edgar  Directed by Clint Eastwood Coming out of a preview screening of J. Edgar Clint Eastwoods new biopic about the founder of the modern FBI I overheard a young woman ask her date ""So was J. Edgar Hoover really gay?"" I didnt hear his answer but I guess I should have been heartened that she would even ask. Despite the lack of any credible evidence Hoover has long since been reduced to a cartoon in the popular imagination squeaky clean G-man by day flaming drag queen by night. No one could possibly make a movie about Hoover now without addressing his sexuality--especially the screenwriter of this one Dustin Lance Black who won an Oscar two years ago for Milk. People are sure to pat him and Eastwood on the back for having handled the subject so tastefully which in practice means that they steer clear of the most absurd stories and treat Hoovers love life with some measure of ambiguity even as they invent all manner of private scenes to portray him as a severely repressed homosexual. For most of his professional life Hoover was dogged by rumors about his sexuality. He lived with his mother until her death in 1938 by which time he was 43 years old and despite social relationships with actress Dorothy Lamour and with Lela Rogers the mother of Ginger Rogers he would never marry. For more than 40 years he maintained an intimate friendship with Clyde Tolson a tall and athletic agent who quickly rose through the ranks to become Hoovers right-hand man. Tolson was slavishly devoted to the director and the two men were inseparable taking meals and even vacationing together. When Tolson suffered a series of strokes in the 1960s Hoover took him into his home and after Hoover died in 1972 Tolson inherited most of his estate. Their close relationship became the primary basis for all the innuendo though Hoover did his best to squash these rumors dispatching agents to grill people whod impugned his reputation and demand that they come across with evidence. No one ever did. Once Hoover and Tolson were both dead however the dam finally burst. In 1993 the British author Anthony Summers whod written best sellers on Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedy assassination published the scandalous Official and Confidential The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover. Summers presented numerous anecdotes suggesting that Hoover and Tolson were lovers for instance a fashion model named Luisa Stuart claimed to have seen them holding hands in the back of a limousine. He also alleged that the mobster Meyer Lansky had acquired a photograph of Hoover fellating Tolson which was the reason the FBI never seriously pursued organized crime figures in the 1950s. But the most devastating story came from Susan Rosenstiel the ex-wife of a business tycoon who was friends with Hoover; she claimed that on two separate occasions in 1958 and 59 she attended sex orgies hosted by right-wing attorney Roy Cohn where she saw Hoover dressed as a woman. At the second party she claimed he wore a red dress and a black feather boa and ordered one leather-clad rent boy to masturbate him as another read aloud from the Bible. This outrageous tale immediately became fodder for late-night comedians and gained such traction that even President Bill Clinton and Senator Bob Dole made public cracks about Hoovers alleged cross-dressing. But consider the source according to a subsequent Esquire story by Peter Maas Rosenstiel had been trying to peddle the cross-dressing story for years convinced that Hoover had collected dirt on her to help her husbands divorce case and according to Ronald Kesslers book The Bureau The Secret History of the FBI shed served time at Rikers Island for perjury in a 1971 case. Even Cohn himself a closeted homosexual appears to have debunked Rosenstiels story. ""[Hoover] would never do anything that would compromise his position as head of the FBI--ever"" Cohn told the publicist Peter Simone whos quoted in Richard Hacks book Puppetmaster The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover. ""There was supposed to be some scandalous pictures of Hoover and Tolson--there were no pictures. Believe me I looked. There were no pictures because there was no sexual relationship."" The stories have taken on a life of their own not necessarily because theyre true but because no one deserved them more than J. Edgar Hoover. For nearly 50 years he treated the FBI as his personal fiefdom spying on American citizens to amass a secret file of sensitive information and using it to blackmail his political opponents. As Black and Eastwood dramatize in their movie Hoover eagerly exploited damaging material hed collected about the extramarital dalliances of Eleanor Roosevelt John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. The swirling rumors that Hoover was homosexual hardly dissuaded him from taking advantage of similar rumors about other people in 1951 he created a ""Sex Deviates"" file that was used to purge gay people from all levels of the federal government as well as police forces and universities; during the 1956 presidential campaign his tip to Walter Winchell prompted the gossip columnist to insinuate on his radio show that Democratic candidate Adlai Stevenson was gay; and as late as 1970 Hoover was supplying the Nixon White House with information about closeted homosexuals in the Washington press corps.

Pictures) Keith Bernstein In this image released by Warner Bros. Pictures Leonardo DiCapio portrays J. Edgar Hoover left and Naomi Watts portrays Helen Gandy in a scene from ""J Edgar."" (AP Photo/Warner Bros. Pictures Keith Bernstein) As the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation J. Edgar Hoover spent 47 years pulling peoples skeletons out of closets. And according to the debatable biopic ""J. Edgar"" he spent a lifetime hiding his own.As directed by Clint Eastwood scripted by Dustin Lance Black (""Milk"") and imitated by Leonardo DiCaprio the man we meet is the mirror image of the mythic crime fighter.While Hoovers scientific methodology and manufactured photo ops made news behind the scenes he waged an illegal war against subversives and perverts including the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. whom Hoover considered a communist sex fiend. Hoover also wiretapped John F. Kennedy Eleanor Roosevelt Marilyn Monroe and countless other liberals while denying that the Mafia even existed. Thanks to the Freedom of Information Act those exploits are public record and such assaults on civil liberties are more pertinent than ever. Yet ""J. Edgar"" is more interested in Hoovers personal life than his political legacy.This time-tripping flick is framed as an oral memoir from a decidedly unreliable source. Over the course of several decades Hoover dictates his autobiography to various faceless flunkies in his inner sanctum. But only two people are allowed to know his secrets Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) who refuses his rash marriage proposal but becomes his trusted secretary; and Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer of ""The Social Network"") a strapping lad who becomes his second-in-command and lifelong social companion.The fourth leg of this lopsided pedestal is Hoovers mother (Judi Dench). In the second-creepiest scene of the movie she warns her socially awkward son against becoming ""a daffodil."" In the creepiest he deals with her death by donning her dress and a string of pearls.Such scenes are strangely fascinating but they do a disservice to history. To get to the juicy stuff Eastwood breezes past the facts in the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergh Jr. which Hoover deemed the crime of the century and leveraged to build a bogus reputation as the ultimate ""G-man."" Even more disappointing is the erasure of Hoovers fingerprints from the botched investigations of the King and Kennedy killings. Bobby gets a cameo during a scene in which Hoover warns the then-attorney general that President Jack better curb his appetites -- but it omits the post-Dallas conversation in which Bobby declared to Hoover ""One of your guys did it.""Even without such material the film feels long. Eastwood is 81 and in the stretch of recent work that includes the incidental ""Invictus"" and the dead-on-arrival ""Hereafter"" the old gunslinger seems slow on the draw. In ""J. Edgar"" hes dogging Martin Scorsese whose superior biopic ""The Aviator"" was sucker-punched by ""Million Dollar Baby"" at the 2005 Oscar ceremony.Here Eastwood has borrowed Scorseses star -- DiCaprio -- but he doesnt have the historical reach or cinematic invention to gild this lily. ""J. Edgar"" is the kind of prestige production that apologists will call polished but even the technical attributes are tinny. In the gay-geezers scenes Hammer wears terrible old-age makeup and the entire film is bathed in sepia tones as weak as its convictions. Its gratifying to see an old bully outed as a hypocrite but by distracting us from bigger crimes ""J. Edgar"" is a public enemy.""J.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The trouble with biopics is the overwhelming pressure to shape a subjects story into a neat arc where a defining characteristic in the first act leads to a predictable uplift or downfall in the third. This approach never does justice to human complexity and it only rarely does justice to a film. In the case of Clint Eastwoods J. Edgar the attempt to accordion J. Edgar Hoovers 50-plus years with the FBI (including in its nascent stages before it was called that) into two hours offers snapshots of many Hoovers without exploring any of them. Eastwoods prim respectful biography presents Hoover in turn as a muddy political metaphor a lesson in self-mythologizing and a case history in repression but never particularly as a man. Leonardo DiCaprio stars as Hoover seen alternately as a Department Of Justice up-and-comer and a fat-suited seventysomething framing the film by dictating his life story to a series of interlocutors who ask polite questions on the audiences behalf. A puritanical humorless driven man even in his 20s he sets standards few can meet whether hes helping reorganize the Library Of Congress or recreating the newly defined FBI in his own image via anti-radical pogroms and innovations in forensic science. Like Dubya in Oliver Stones W. hes largely defined by his desire to please a controlling withholding parent (Judi Dench); in particular a key line from her about how shed rather have a dead son than a gay one defines his lifelong undercurrent-laden-but-chaste relationship with fellow FBI administrator Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). In his script Dustin Lance Black (Milk) hits some key milestones in Hoovers life particularly the Lindbergh-baby kidnapping but he only defines Hoover in reaction to his mother and his era and he never bridges the gap between the idealistic youth and the blackmailing politico. DiCaprio isnt much help; hes often compelling but he rarely gets to clarify Hoovers emotions or intentions. Theres obvious contemporary political relevance in many of Hoovers offhanded statements--say his conviction that its worth pursuing anyone who might commit crimes--and some more universal lessons toward the end of the film where the gap between reality and his self-image becomes clear. But the gap between this nicely shot neatly gift-wrapped package and messy human reality feels equally wide.

"J. Edgar reviewed Clint Eastwood directs Leonardo DiCaprio in a J. Edgar Hoover movie Slate Sign In Sign Up J. Edgar Reviewed Part History Channel Re-Enactment Part Fascinating Exploration of Hoovers Sexuality J. Edgar Reviewed Part History Channel Re-Enactment Part Fascinating Exploration of Hoovers Sexuality Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 9 2011 536 PM J. Edgar Part History Channel re-enactment part fascinating exploration of Hoovers sexuality. By Dana Stevens Leonardo DiCaprio as J. Edgar Hoover in J. Edgar Photograph by Keith Bernstein/(c)2011 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. All Rights Reserved. To a greater degree than any of Clint Eastwoods films so far J. Edgar (Warner Bros.) a sprawling biopic of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover is a meditation about the passage of time both in a nation and in a single human body. When the film (scripted by Dustin Lance Black the Oscar-winning writer of Milk) focuses on the slow decline of its complex half-hero half-villain the results are surprisingly perceptive and tender. But when (as for most of its running time) it tries to provide a sweeping overview of seven decades of American history J. Edgar can feel generic and vague like a soft-focus newsreel or a strung-together series of History Channel re-enactments. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. At once epic and scattershot J. Edgar spans the period from 1919 when a 24-year-old Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) was made the head of the new intelligence division at what was then called the Bureau of Investigation until 1972 when Hoover dies. Eastwood layers three or four different time frames in a series of nested flashbacks. The effect is less confusing than you might think--each stage of Hoovers life is shot with a distinct look and feel making them easy to tell apart. But this multiple-timeline structure sometimes seems arbitrary Are we cutting back and forth between various old and young Hoovers because they mutually illuminate one anothers stories or just so every incarnation will get equal screen time? The life of a public official who served every president from Wilson through Nixon covers a lot of American history from the left-wing anarchist bombings of 1919 (which Hoover made his name by squelching) through the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby the Red Scare and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. J. Edgar lingers longer on some of these events than others--the investigation of the Lindbergh case constitutes a significant plot thread while the JFK assassination gets taken care of in a single phone call. Despite a regrettably heavy use of voice-over from DiCaprio to patch together these periods the historical-survey aspect of J. Edgar isnt an unrelieved plod--moments of insight and wit are interwoven with the civics-class slideshow. In a wonderfully mordant dirty joke Hoover receives the phone call about the JFK assassination while listening in visible discomfort to a surveillance tape of a woman having an orgasm. Advertisement By far the best thing in J. Edgar is the films portrait of the relationship between Hoover and his longtime companion Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). Just what sort of companion Tolson was to Hoover has never been entirely clear not only to Hoovers contemporaries and biographers but in this films vision to Hoover and Tolson themselves. The two men never married worked side by side at the FBI for decades and were famous for never missing a meal together. Blacks script imagines Clyde and Edgars love as a kind of open secret between the two men They privately confess their devotion to one another occasionally even hold hands discreetly in the back of a cab but Clydes first (and perhaps only) attempt at a kiss gets him a punch in the jaw. Whatever set of tacit agreements this couple lives by its a devils bargain and the scenes in which the men try to negotiate the boundaries of their relationship are painfully and beautifully drawn. Armie Hammer--last seen in a kind of stunt performance as the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network--is divine as the dashing slyly ambitious but also deeply loyal Clyde. Unfortunately in the old-age scenes Hammer is burdened with unconvincing-looking age makeup that makes him seem to be acting from inside a latex mask (which I guess he is with some CGI assistance). For some reason DiCaprios age makeup works much better than Hammers. Witnessing the advancing decrepitude of Hoovers body is not only convincing but at times harrowing. (As the heros jowls and paunch accumulate and his skin grows puffy and sallow J. Edgar dips a toe into the body-horror genre.) In the films drier stretches (there are a lot of details about the Lindbergh trial) I found myself wondering about this discrepancy in age-makeup effectiveness between the two actors. Is it simply because DiCaprio still baby-faced at 36 is that much closer to the grave than his 24-year-old co-star? Or are certain kinds of faces harder to artificially age than others? Though Ive never been a huge DiCaprio fan--he strikes me as one of those actors who works too hard whose effort and dedication are too visible on the screen--I think he deserves credit for the perceived continuity between the young and old versions of Hoover. His exploration of his characters physicality is detailed and complete down to the walk the gestures the manner of tying a tie or holding a handkerchief. For me DiCaprios performance never achieved true liftoff--I found myself imagining what an actor like Jeremy Renner might have done with the role--but his level of craft is impressive and his portrait of Hoover both complex and affecting. Advertisement This biopic evinces a curious neutrality toward its subject a Gods-eye-view thats at once disapproving and gentle. There are long stretches of scenes in which the socially maladapted Hoover seems like a fragile and sympathetic figure (especially when hes being alternately browbeaten and babied by his domineering mother played by the glorious Judi Dench). The love story with Tolson also emphasizes Hoovers vulnerability as does his lifelong working relationship with his fanatically dedicated secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts note-perfect as always). But when we see the political Hoover in action--conducting illegal surveillance lying to biographers even attempting to sabotage Martin Luther Kings acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize--his nefarious motives seem somehow abstract. What does Clint Eastwood a Republican who was once a politician himself actually think about the man who ruled over the FBI and meddled in civilian affairs for most of the last century? Or is Eastwood trying to say that Hoover was intrinsically unknowable a black hole of contradictions and competing impulses? Whether unintentionally or by design the movie never really makes a case either for or against the troubled figure at its center. ""He was a complex guy"" muses Eastwood in the press notes as taciturn as the Man With No Name. As Leonardo DiCaprio has taken more serious roles he has developed a signature pucker face the more ambitious the movie the more pinched his face becomes.

"J. Edgar movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs J. Edgar gets a careful competent screen analysis via Clint Eastwood -- 3 starsNovember 07 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticLeonardo DiCaprio stars in J. Edgar.""In the 1959 film ""The FBI Story"" Federal Bureau of Investigation director J. Edgar Hoover -- photographed from the rear his face unseen -- plays a younger cameo version of himself speaking to G-men (James Stewart among them) about the newly formed agency and how its operation will remain free of all politics and the whims of any one presidential administration.Hoover following the Hoover-approved script then expounds on the ""love of justice."" He says ""I warn you now. That is the most demanding of affections.""Make that the second-most demanding. For more than half a century speculation regarding Hoovers private life has focused on whether this bulldog of all-American virtue knew an even more formidable affection -- fraught with secrecy given the times and Hoovers public profile and wrapped in layers of emotional and sexual denial.Director Clint Eastwoods ""J. Edgar"" featuring a valiant performance from Leonardo DiCaprio is a demure rather touching inquiry into this possibility. Molded by the presence and then the absence of a smothering mother (Judi Dench) who at one point says shed ""rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a son"" Hoover ran the FBI and amassed confidential politically explosive files on a universe of dissidents and enemies from 1935 until his death in 1972. (Hoover also ran the comparatively toothless precursor to the FBI for more than a decade.) Did this power brokers longtime working friendship with assistant Clyde Tolson constitute the one great love of his life sexually intimate or no?Constructed as an elaborate interweave of flashbacks starting with the Red Scare ""Palmer raids"" of 1919 and 1920 the movie poses many questions. But rarely does this central question relating to Hoover Tolson and what was between them fade entirely.In recent interviews for the film Eastwood has done his best to dismiss his own biopics inferences saying among other things that the movies not about ""two gay guys."" (Which sounds like the title of a new CBS sitcom.) All the same the films screenplay from Oscar-winning ""Milk"" scribe Lance Dustin Black is very much interested in Hoovers intimate relationship with Tolson an Arrow Collar ad come to life in the hands of Armie Hammer. It is very much concerned with how Hoovers various facets coexisted in the same psyche Hoover the closeted homosexual Hoover the rustler of radicals and pinkos Hoover the one-time paramour of Dorothy Lamour (the film glances briefly on this) Hoover the martinet and blackmailer and mothers son.Imagine how Oliver Stone mightve handled this material (he got his own licks in with ""Nixon"" in which Bob Hoskins played Hoover as a sniveling wart hog of a bureaucrat) and whatever your minds eye sees in terms of hysteria and aggressive visual technique youll get the opposite in Eastwoods dispassionate approach.""J. Edgar"" suggests convincingly that Hoover was in love and felt he couldnt do anything about it except spend as many meals and vacations and days and weeks and years with Tolson as he could manage. Tolson screenwriter Black infers was more willing to speak the love that dared not speak its name. We see briefly a hand-clasp in the back of a limousine. And in one startling and shrewdly staged hotel-room encounter Tolson -- fed up with Hoovers inability to come clean about his desires -- turns on his superior which leads to a fight which leads to a single angry kiss.For much of the film Eastwoods studiously objective stance sets the tone for the story of a man whose misdeeds and hypocrisies are perhaps too discreetly handled. In the hotel room scene however as in the other ""talking point"" moment (involving the shaky old rumor about Hoover and cross-dressing) ""J. Edgar"" brings out the best in both DiCaprio and his director.This may be a closety film about a closety character but the tensions between Eastwoods direction and the script hes directing keep us off-guard in an intriguing way. The results whatever one thinks of them may be square but theyre all of a piece. Eastwoods house style remains very much in the house here. Cinematographer Tom Sterns hot flat chalky-white lighting pours into every interior while Eastwoods self-penned musical score (a key theme borrowing the first three notes of Duke Ellingtons ""Solitude"") stresses the tender side of its subject at any cost.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesFbis Hoover Uncovered In A Wild `G-manApril 25 1995Hoover Gossip Is Titillating But Unworthy Of Serious...March 31 1993Below The SurfaceSeptember 21 1997`Hoover` Heavy On Rumor And MelodramaNovember 22 1987John Mohr Aide To Fbis HooverFebruary 3 1997Find More Stories AboutTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1107-j-edgar-20111107,0,2976630.column",200,j.edgar19,j.edgar,chicagotribune
"J. Edgar (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review J. Edgar (R) Despite its flaws Clint Eastwoods sprawling biopic of the late FBI director humanizes the legend. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/9/2011 Editor rating 2.5 J. Edgar Clint Eastwoods curious biopic of the late FBI director J. Edgar Hoover isnt entirely convincing. Half of this expansive picture which was written by the Oscar-winning Dustin Lance Black (Milk) is too on-the-nose and literal Its hammy hokum. When Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Hoover remarks ""What determines a mans legacy is often what is not seen"" you roll your eyes at the bluntness of the line. The other half of J. Edgar -- the weird half the one that involves domineering mothers pearl necklaces and furtive gay affairs -- goes further than you might expect. This is Eastwoods Brokeback Mountain chased by a healthy serving of J.F.K.- style paranoia and conspiracies (Oliver Stone is going to love this movie.) But because so much of what the film says about Hoover remains speculative and unproven J. Edgar cant fully cross all its Ts. Theres a hesitance for example in the pictures depiction of the complicated relationship between Hoover and Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) who rose through the ranks to become the associate director of the FBI -- and according to the film participated in a decades-long platonic romance with his boss. Hammer best known for his portrayal of the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network adds some much needed levity into this often dour glum movie. He plays Tolson as a spirited bon vivant who keeps his homosexuality in plain albeit discreet sight (during his first job interview at the FBI he fixes the curtains in the office window.) Once their closeted relationship is underway Tolson makes no demands on Hoover other than to insist they always have lunch and dinner together. Tolson is the opposite of the repressed furtive Hoover and hes willing to wait for his partner to come around. He loses his patience only when Hoover says hes planning to propose to the actress Dorothy Lamour Tolsons explosive reaction results in one of J. Edgars tensest confrontations dealing head-on with Hoovers homophobia and self-loathing. But there too the film stops short of taking a stand and the vagueness is frustrating. J. Edgar places the blame for Hoovers personality -- his paranoia his constant quest for power and his inability to explore his sexuality -- primarily on his mother (Judi Dench) who sounds like shes giving him an order instead of a compliment when she says ""You will rise to be the most powerful man in the country."" Later when Hoover tries to confide in her (""Mother I dont like to dance with women"") she immediately shuts down the conversation ""Id rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a son."" That analysis might seem a bit simplistic and convenient. But J. Edgar eloquently argues its case by skipping through Hoovers entire career from the founding of the Bureau in 1935 to his death in 1972. Certain key moments are highlighted Hoovers frustration when the FBI got its first big case -- the kidnapping of Charles Lindberghs infant son -- but didnt have the jurisdiction to lead the investigation; his battle against Hollywoods glamorization of gangsters in the 1930s; and the way Hoover blackmailed famous politicians leaders and even presidents (including Martin Luther King and John F. Kennedy) as a way of protecting his job and doing what he felt was best for the country. DiCaprio takes a little while to disappear into the role of Hoover At first all you notice is his accent and the prosthetics used to age him (DiCaprios makeup is fine but Hammers is horrifically bad). But DiCaprios usual pluck and confidence have an unexpected effect on Hoover The actor helps you get past Hoovers coarseness and bluster focusing instead on the grand tragedy of his life. Like Anthony Hopkins did in Nixon DiCaprio rescues a key figure in American politics from his reductive boogeyman reputation Hoover may still be a monster but in J. Edgar hes unfailingly human too. J. Edgar hop scotches back and forth through more than five decades of American history and Eastwood savors small incidents that other filmmakers might have ignored (such as Hoovers photo-op with Shirley Temple at the lobby of a Times Square movie theater in Manhattan). The film takes its time as Eastwood tends to do but the accumulation of detail over the years is necessary in order to bring this elusive figure to life (as his unflaggingly faithful secretary Naomi Watts does a lot with a largely superfluous role; her loyalty to Hoover even after his death is another reminder that he was also loved.) J. Edgar doesnt let Hoover off the hook The movie pulls off a nice reversal near the end by exposing him to be a most unreliable narrator making you question much of what youve just seen. But there too the intent is not to demonize. J. Edgar doesnt pardon any of Hoovers transgressions or abuses -- he remains on one level a schoolyard bully -- but the movie also argues that Hoover wasnt merely drunk with power He was also terrified of disappointing people.

Edgar Genre Drama Biography; Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Armie Hammer Josh Lucas Naomi Watts; Director Clint Eastwood; Author Dustin Lance Black; Release Date Wide 11/09/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 137; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted November 16 2011 -- 1200 AM EST Leonardo DiCaprio has given many fine performances but he has often seemed trapped in a certain preternatural matinee-idol youthfulness. Whether in a brooding period piece like Gangs of New York or a pop head-game like Inception he inevitably comes off as lean and lithe and eager with that movie-star-as-lion-cub face. I thought that quality really hampered him in The Aviator where he lacked even a trace of Howard Hughes rugged gravitas; he seemed like a boy playing a man. So I was skeptical of how well he would do in the role of that stocky ruthless bulldog J. Edgar Hoover the most famous director -- in many ways the inventor -- of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. But in Clint Eastwoods emotionally reticent yet absorbing J. Edgar DiCaprio does more than disappear behind steely glasses and prosthetic old-age makeup. He transforms himself in a feat of acting from the inside out. The first thing you notice about DiCaprios John Edgar Hoover is that he speaks in one of those jarringly proper early-20th-century Brahmin accents. It takes a bit of getting used to but DiCaprio makes the dialect work and it keys us to Hoovers rather rigid interior life. Even when hes young Edgar as hes known to those closest to him is starchy and furrowed with eyebrows scrunched down low (he looks a bit like the Dick Tracy villain Flattop). DiCaprio gives him a gleam of suspicion and a stately formal body language that will harden over time into a combative waddle. Written by Dustin Lance Black (Milk) the movie cuts back and forth between the 20s and 30s when Hoover built the FBI and planted it in the popular imagination and the early 60s when his methods began to congeal into something paranoid and deluded. The crosscutting frankly is a bit much; the film never quite finds a present tense. Yet Blacks script is densely detailed and fascinating. Eastwood forsaking his deliberate rhythms for something speedier and wordier turns J. Edgar into a dramatic essay about how the law and repression heroism and corruption fused in Hoover. Its in 1919 that a 24-year-old Hoover first glimpses what he sees as the basic threat to American life bomb-planting Communist agitators. As the film presents it he may be right about the dangers of anarchy. But the subversives hes driven to crack down on also offend something fundamental in his nature. Hes not just devoted to law and order. He craves control. From the outset he has an epic plan to make the methods of Sherlock Holmes bureaucratic. He collects forensic evidence (at this point the authorities throw away the majority of crime-scene clues) hiring oddball experts like a man who knows everything about grains of wood. And he dreams of a centralized database devoted to the bold new science of fingerprinting. Hes inventing modern law enforcement and he has triumphs like hunting down the kidnapper of Charles Lindberghs baby. Yet theres a hidden madness to Hoovers method. He still lives with his mother (Judi Dench) and his devotion to her has a touch of Norman Bates. On a date with the comely Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) he shows off the card-catalog system he created for the Library of Congress. Is it any wonder that she becomes not his lover but his secretary? And when Hoover interviews a strapping prospective agent named Clyde Tolson sweat trembles on his upper lip. He may be trying to rein in more than Communism. The closest the movie comes to having an emotional center is Hoovers relationship with Tolson (played with soft sympathy by The Social Networks Armie Hammer) who becomes his friend right-hand man and dinner companion. As the film presents it the two experience a love that cant be acted upon that cant even speak its name. Thats Hoovers tragedy -- but it is also in J. Edgar his pathology. His obsession with secrecy with using illegal wiretaps to keep private files on politicians (like JFK) for the implicit threat of blackmailing them emerges out of his hidden sense of shame. Over time Hoovers enemies shift from the lefties of the 20s to the gangsters of the 30s and finally to the social-protest leaders of the 60s like Martin Luther King Jr. whom he sees as an enemy of the state. Hoover never changes. Instead he blinds himself to how America changes. Yet his angry paranoia isnt exactly something that you can identify with. I was held by J. Edgar but its a movie -- like the man at its center -- with a buried heart. B Movie Links J.

""My work comes first"" says prim secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) after a rather unusual date with a young J. Edgar Hoover. (Hes played as you will have heard by Leonardo DiCaprio if you can find him under heavy eyebrows and several tons of pancake.) Hoover has lunged awkwardly in the general direction of Miss Gandys lips but both the date and the lunge lack all conviction and the air is thick with their mutual relief when she turns him down. Thus is the groundwork laid for a lifelong partnership uncluttered by anything so messy as an animal instinct. Enter hoping for a little more action with his boss Hoovers sidekick Clyde Tolson whos played by Armie Hammer with just enough saucy innuendo to make you want a whole lot more. Like Hoover himself though J. Edgar is mostly dry-as-dust business. Handsomely upholstered in period browns and grays the movie puts its head down and plods conscientiously through the well-known milestones of Hoovers career from his childhood with his ambitious virago of a mother (Judi Dench) through the Red-baiting years and then the organized-crime-fighting years (a few lackluster explosions ensue). On then through his obsession with tracking the night-lives of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. arriving at last at his queasy standoffs with Nixon -- the hatred was mutual -- and his sorry finale as a doped-up geezer who refuses to retire long after his day is done. Thats a lot of 20th century to pack into anyones biodrama and the movies slack pacing and choppy leaps back and forth in time will only confuse moviegoers too young to know their history. If theres an Oscar waiting in the wings for J. Edgar it will go to the heroic folks in makeup. Its easy to see what attracted Eastwood a lifelong libertarian to the story of a government bureaucrat who dedicated his life to invading Americans privacy and violating their civil rights. But Eastwoods portrait of Hoovers many contradictions rarely goes beyond conventional biography. J. Edgar follows the consensus view of its subject that Hoover was married to his job that he was a techno-bureaucrat whose obsession with fingerprinting and forensics expanded the reach of American surveillance well beyond his own passion for smoking out radicals crime bosses and oversexed politicians with more charisma in their little fingers than this prissy suit of a man would ever achieve. i Domestic Asset Armie Hammers Clyde Tolson (left with DiCaprio and Judi Dench as Hoovers mother Annie) is an unexpectedly sympathetic presence in an otherwise unconvincing film. Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros. Pictures Domestic Asset Armie Hammers Clyde Tolson (left with DiCaprio and Judi Dench as Hoovers mother Annie) is an unexpectedly sympathetic presence in an otherwise unconvincing film. Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros. Pictures Like so many fanatics Hoover was as blind to his own failings as he was intolerant of those of others. Covering the well-documented vagaries of his personality Eastwood is at pains to shows us what an unreliable narrator and hypocrite Hoover was. Yet one question J. Edgar never asks is why a man of so little vision or imagination exercises such a powerful hold on the public imagination to this day. And surely film is the medium in which to ask the question Down the years Hoover has been portrayed by literally dozens of big-league actors from Ernest Borgnine through Bob Hoskins and Kelsey Grammer and now to DiCaprio whose serviceable performance in this serviceable movie will surely go down as one of the least definitive. Perhaps inevitably J. Edgar only wakes up and then all too gingerly when it sidles up to the question of Hoovers sexual orientation. Eastwood and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black -- who clearly had a lot more fun writing Milk than here where even when holding hands Hoover and Tolson sound as if theyre reading memos to one another -- embrace the theory that Hoover was a closet case too terrified of his sexuality to act on it. Related NPR Stories Movie Interviews Leonardo DiCaprio Brings The Complex J. Edgar To Life On Film The movie does cater briefly to rumors of cross-dressing but only to demonstrate that Hoovers heart belonged first and forever to Mama entertainingly rendered by Dench as a monster mom whose ambition for her appallingly compliant son is topped only by her homophobia -- and by her frigid disapproval when her prodigy fails to bring back the kidnapped Lindbergh baby alive. Whether Hoover and Tolson actually became lovers in real life remains a mystery. In the movie at least Tolson was wise to Hoovers illegal espionage activities his false claims of having arrested John Dillinger and other crime bosses himself his vile racism and his intermittently shabby betrayals of Tolson himself. Tolson was no saint and the movie offers no sense of why other than getting close to power he was attracted to an automaton as emotionally stunted as Hoover. Yet Hammer fresh off his sprightly turn as the horrid Winkelvoss twins in The Social Network is so persuasive -- both as a smooth young blade on the make and as a gnarled old gent making his peace with the flawed man he has chosen to adore -- that he redeems this lumbering quasi-history and brings it to life as a surprisingly tender love story.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Leonardo DiCaprio is at less than his best as the rather unattractive G-Man and his accent is needless.Story highlightsIt is quite simply a poorly conceived and constructed filmThe film refuses to take any position on Hoover whatsoeverIts too bad that one of modern cinemas great master filmmakers couldnt do more""J. Edgar"" is the latest in what seems to be a never-ending trend of treating a biopic as being compelling and interesting simply because the subject may be. The thing is films dont work that way and while J. Edgar Hoover was indeed a fascinating man and important in our countrys history Clint Eastwoods film from a script by Dustin Lance Black (""Milk"") is dull from start to finish and often bears little resemblance to the truth. Lets be clear about one thing up front J. Edgar Hoover was a bad guy. He was a power-obsessed racist paranoid with little concern for the working people immigrants or ethnic minorities that helped build this country. He was the perfect example of someone who believed that in order to protect the United States he was entitled to shred the document on which the country was founded the U.S. Constitution. How or more importantly why those virtually undisputed facts were twisted into the mockery of history that is Eastwoods ""J. Edgar"" is anyones guess.It is quite simply a poorly conceived and constructed film. The through line if you can call it that is Hoovers narration of his so-called memoirs to a series of FBI agents tasked with taking his dictation each segment of which leads us to a chapter in Hoovers life. His goal is clearly not to represent history -- since much of what he tells the agents is patently untrue -- and more to cement his own legacy as he sees it A crusading champion of truth (yeah right) justice (haw) and the ""American Way.""The problem is there are also scenes in the film that are not part of his memoirs and at times its hard to tell the difference between the first person and third person. Considering the films length theres a good chance audiences will stop caring at some point. I know I did.CNN Photos Historical images of J. Edgar HooverBlurred political history notwithstanding ""J.Edgar"" is so boring as to give tedium a bad name. Theres no beginning-middle-end -- and while thats not necessarily an issue in and of itself something has to replace that traditional structure. Here its an endless stream of flash-forwards and flashbacks of young Hoover old Hoover young Hoover again not-so-young-as-young Hoover middle-aged Hoover gay Hoover mommas boy Hoover dictating Hoover. Its enough to make you dizzy.Leonardo DiCaprio is at less than his best as the rather unattractive G-Man and his accent is needless. Hoover was from Washington D.C. and no one cares what he sounded like. Add that to his nervous tics strange speech patterns and barely hidden stutter and its hard to see the forest for the trees as it were. Eastwood prides himself on bringing in films on time and under budget and perhaps thats why the old age makeup was so dreadful. Considering the advances in modern cinema makeup I cant see any other reason. In portraying Hoovers long-time companion Clyde Tolson Armie Hammer looks like a burn victim in his later years. The thing is Hoover was an interesting character and his story could make (and maybe has made) for a compelling literary biography. A film however has to have some sort of dramatic structure or tension. The audience needs either someone to root for -- or in this case against -- and Eastwood and Black dont give this to us.A perfect example of what could have been done is George Clooneys exceptional 2005 film ""Good Night and Good Luck"" where Clooney and co-writer Grant Heslov took the unvarnished villainy of Sen. Joseph McCarthy and crafted a compelling human drama around the bad guy. Granted it wasnt billed as a biography of McCarthy but perhaps thats the point.An argument can be made that living your life as a self-loathing closeted homosexual a life which Hoover has been accused of living can turn anyone into an unpleasant unhappy angry person and lets for a moment assume that the theories about Hoovers closeted homosexuality are true. Add to them what we know as fact about the man Anti-communist anti-labor racist mommas boy socially awkward former stutterer paranoid and power-hungry proponent of ""the ends justify the means."" There you have an incredibly complex man and while the movie touches on many of these aspects they leave it at that. Its like offering someone a steak without mentioning the cut accompaniments quality of the meat cooking method etc.While Hoover is shown trying to blackmail everyone from Franklin D. Roosevelt to Martin Luther King and routinely circumventing the law these are not portrayed as particularly bad things to do. Nor it must be said are they shown to be good things. Therein lies the films major problem. It refuses to take any position on Hoover whatsoever resulting in an overlong and uninteresting slog.The old saying that there are two sides to every story is simply not true. Hoover was not an ambiguous villain. Rather he could be viewed as a despicable man who ruined the lives of many good people and may have caused the deaths of many of his so-called enemies. He routinely broke the law and exceeded his mandate under the guise of protecting America. Its too bad that one of modern cinemas great master filmmakers couldnt do more with such a compelling character and important part of this countrys history. Skip this and watch the aforementioned Clooney film again.""J. Edgar"" is rated R. I assume this is for strong language as theres nothing else in the film that would warrant the rating. The film opens in limited release today and wide release on Friday.Powered by LivefyreHomeRegionsU.S.AfricaAmericasAsiaChinaEuropeMiddle EastOpinionU.S. PoliticsElection 2016NationWorldOur TeamBusinessMarketsTechLuxuryEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationVital SignsSportFootballGolfTennisMotorsportHorseracingEquestrianSailingTravelAviationBusiness TravellerDestinationsFeaturesFood/DrinkHotelsPartner HotelsFashionDesignArchitectureArtsAutosLuxuryFeaturesCulinary JourneysFreedom ProjectImpact Your WorldInside AfricaSilk Road2 degreesAll FeaturesVideoVideo newsFeature showsTV showsTV scheduleFaces of CNN WorldwideMore...WeatherCNN HeroesCNN Profiles A-ZCNN LeadershipCNN PressroomCNN Partner sitesiReportInternational EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

Edgar 3.5 stars by Bill Goodykoontz - Nov. 9 2011 0946 AM The Arizona Republic Clint Eastwood knows how to take care of his actors. J. Edgar Fair to good Director Clint Eastwood. Cast Leonardo DiCaprio Armie Hammer Judi Dench. Rating R for brief strong language. This weeks new movie releases Spotlight Leonardo DiCaprio Spotlight Clint Eastwood But is it coming at the expense of his films? Some of his more recent movies such as ""Changeling"" and ""Invictus"" got Oscar nominations for the likes of Angelina Jolie Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon. Interview Clint Eastwood talks J. Edgar Leonardo DiCaprio talks J. Edgar Hoover All were deserved but the films werent as good as one would have liked coming from the director of ""Million Dollar Baby"" ""Mystic River"" and ""Unforgiven"" among others. Eastwoods latest film ""J. Edgar"" is a bit of both things. Its an actors dream a film in which complex roles abound. Oscar nominations will abound too no doubt most likely for Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role Judi Dench as his controlling mother and Armie Hammer as his longtime assistant and perhaps lover. But the film is not a disappointment in the class of that first bunch nor is it the triumph that the latter films were. It is flawed but ultimately captivating. J. Edgar is of course J. Edgar Hoover the longtime director of the FBI rumored to be a closeted homosexual who maybe dabbled in cross-dressing as well. All of these aspects of his life are covered as is his opportunism. Hoover was around for so long -- he served as FBI director for nearly 50 years -- that he was something of a law-enforcement Forrest Gump present for some of the biggest crimes of the 20th century and quick to take advantage of them to further his professional and personal interests. The same man who created a nationalized fingerprinting system also kept secret files on just about everyone of consequence and wasnt afraid to use those files whether against the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. or one of the many presidents under whom he served. Eastwood and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black who won an Oscar for ""Milk"" tell the story by way of a framing device An elderly Hoover near death is dictating his memoirs. Hoover begins his career as an overeager underling laughed at by the secretaries for showing up to meetings too early. He takes particular interest in Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) asking her to marry him on their third date. Shes not interested but does sign on as his personal secretary for the duration of his career. Hoover still lives with his mother Annie (Dench) and would until her death years later well into Hoovers tenure as director. She is a controlling woman who cruelly shoots down any expression that would even hint at Hoovers potential homosexuality saying she would rather have a dead son than a ""daffodil."" She will figure into Hoovers eventual donning of a dress though the scene is handled with sensitivity not salaciousness. So too is Hoovers relationship with Clyde Tolson (Hammer) to whom Hoover takes an immediate liking. Or perhaps there is more to the attraction (some scenes suggest this though never overtly). Hoover hires Tolson as his second in command; hes mostly seen as a quasi-romantic interest but also serves as a not-always-successful conscience for Hoover when the latter goes too far with his law-enforcement methods. Hammer is outstanding. Tolson is portrayed as obviously gay and his affection for Hoover is touching if a little hard to figure. One of the best scenes in the film involves Hoover railing against Eleanor Roosevelt about whom he thinks he has evidence of a relationship with another woman. Imagine he exclaims her having an affair with a woman The way Hammer cocks his head and raises his eyebrow is perfect. Dench too is good. She loves her son but smothers him often chilling with her passive-aggressive behavior. But DiCaprio is the catalyst. Portraying Hoover over a half-century requires use of a lot of makeup. Yet DiCaprio is as effective as the older Hoover as he is the young one. His Hoover is a repressed confused man unwilling or unable to truly be himself. So who is he? In Hoovers mind he beat back communism and radicalism. But at what cost to civil liberties? Parallels with contemporary trade-offs are presumably intentional if not especially effective. But for all that acting the film seems somehow off incomplete. Eastwood leaves a lot to the audience to decide. Hoover remains a mystery which is fine but a little more guidance in navigating his life would have been helpful. That can be frustrating but not fatally so. The strength of the performances and complexity of the characters is such that ""J. Edgar"" is worth seeing again flaws and all. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

"J. Edgar | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; j-edgar ) J. Edgar (United States 2011) November 09 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Who knew the life story of J. Edgar Hoover could be so arid? Actually thats unfair but there are stretches of J. Edgar when the proceedings seem to drag. Counterbalancing the occasional bursts of tedium however are a tremendous lead performance impeccable period detail the fascinating use of an ""unreliable narrator"" and some individually compelling scenes. As a whole however theres something lacking here. The movie is watchable but not mesmerizing. Part of the problem is that putting aside the fragmented and out-of-order chronology (accomplished using flashbacks and flashbacks-within-flashbacks) J. Edgar is a very ordinary bio-pic about an extraordinary individual. And although Hoover generated a variety of passionate responses from individuals throughout the 20th century theres nothing in this movie that provokes much in the way of an emotional connection with or against him. J. Edgar is a workmanlike production that should garner an Oscar nomination for Leonardo DiCaprio but its not a great motion picture or even an especially memorable one. J. Edgar chronicles the life of the first FBI director from his time toiling in the field during the Hoover administration to his final year crossing swords with Richard Nixon. Hoovers early days including his relentless attacks on ""Communist radicals"" his hunting down of Prohibition era outlaws and his investigation of the Lindbergh babys kidnapping are detailed via flashbacks as he tells his story to an official biographer. The ""present"" time line encapsulates the ten-year period from 1962 to 1972 with Hoover using his ""secret files"" to blackmail the Kennedys then pursuing a vendetta against Martin Luther King. Director Clint Eastwood working from a script by Milks Dustin Lance Black does not shy away from issues surrounding Hoovers sexuality although the character is presented more as asexual than homosexual. His relationship with close companion and deputy director Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) is offered as the chaste byproduct of a man whos frightened by intimacy. The two have deep feelings for one another but Hoover is so deep in the closet that he cannot act upon them. The words of his mother (Judi Dench) a religious homophobe haunt him. She at one time states she would rather have a dead child than one who grows up to be gay. Posthumous innuendoes about Hoover being a cross-dresser are addressed obliquely. The approach embraced by the filmmakers mixes established facts with gossip and rumor to fashion an ambiguous portrait of the individual viewed by many as being the most powerful man in America during the post-World War II era. DiCaprio wears the persona of Hoover with ease again reminding audiences that the young man who made so many girls swoon with Titanic has grown into an actor of great range and capability. His portrayal here eclipses that of his Howard Hughes interpretation in Martin Scorseses The Aviator and equals or exceeds his best screen work to-date. He wears the subpar old age makeup believably although it is at times a distraction. DiCaprio passes the acid test for any bio-pic as we lose our sense of the performer and the performance and see only the historical individual he is embodying. Aside from DiCaprio and Hammer who is effective as Hoovers friend-slash-possible lover the only actor with substantive screen time is Naomi Watts who has the thankless job of portraying Hoovers faithful secretary Helen Gandy. Watts appears frequently throughout the movie but doesnt have a lot to do. Several well-known actors have appearances in small roles - Judi Dench as Hoovers mother Dermot Mulroney as a New Jersey cop Josh Lucas as Charles Lindbergh and Lea Thompson as Ginger Rogers mom. Aside from DiCaprios performance the most remarkable aspect of J. Edgar is the period design. With de-saturated colors making things appear almost black-and-white the 1920s and 1930s feel like the 1920s and 1930s. Recently Eastwood has been drawn to period pictures and history-based accounts and J. Edgar fits into both categories. If Eastwood can be said to have a style however this lies outside of it. His movies are often overlong (as is the case here) but theres a low-key tranquility to the way J. Edgar develops that is unlike anything the venerable director has recently accomplished. This man was once Dirty Harry? Dramatically the film finds its groove when illustrating the lengths to which Hoover goes to amass power and enhance public perceptions of him and the FBI. His speeches in front of Congress are remarkable pieces of oratorical skill. His use of blackmail on persons of influence (including presidents) leads to one scene in which he jousts with Robert Kennedy (the then-Attorney General for JFK). In moments like this we see the black hat and the white steed the man who loves his country but is willing to flout its laws for what he perceives to be ""the good of the people."" What J. Edgar lacks is drive. It is at times too staid and straightforward. It skims along the surface rather than delving beneath the roiling waters of Hoovers personality to provide a more potent glimpse of the man. Hoover is as much an enigma at the end of the movie as he is at the beginning. In many ways this is a text book account of his life in that it provides a competent biography without adding much in the way of color or passion. There is a clever conceit in the way we learn that how Hoover views himself (and perhaps how history sees him) is not necessarily reflective of how things were. Nevertheless the narratives length and periods of low energy make it a challenge and better suited for those with a particular interest in Hoover his times or his legacy. J.

Edgar Hoover Unmasked The Daily Beast Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture He virtually invented the FBI and its predecessor the Bureau of Investigation bringing forensic science into the modern age and with the 10 Most Wanted list in every post office luring the citizen into the crime-stopping process. He oversaw the men who brought down John Dillinger and arrested Lindbergh baby killer Bruno Hauptmann. He tracked down terror suspects and Nazi spies socialists and civil rights leaders but couldnt be bothered rounding up Mafia bosses. He ran the Bureau for 48 years under eight Presidents some of whom he blackmailed with White House secrets he threatened to spill. The sordid goods he collected on John F. Kennedy Martin Luther King and Eleanor Roosevelt helped keep him in power. For most of his adult life this confirmed bachelor lived with his domineering mother Annie and when she died with Clyde Tolson an FBI Associate Director who many thought was his lover. The life and career of John Edgar Hoover should make a juicy movie; and in 1977 just five years after his death it did Larry Cohens The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover with James Wainwright as the young Edgar Broderick Crawford as the elder Hoover June Havoc as his mother and Dan Dailey as Tolson. Bracingly lurid the film filters all the political and sexual dirt through an imaginary FBI agent (Rip Torn) who notes that Hoover died just six weeks before the Watergate scandal that eventually toppled his No. 1 enemy of the moment Richard Nixon. It was the Torn characters says ""as if J. Edgar Hoover had reached out from the grave"" to destroy Nixon. Not until 2005 was it revealed that Bob Woodwards Deep Throat source of the most incriminating Watergate leads was Mark Felt another Associate Director at the FBI. (MORE TIMEs Top 10 Biopics) Now Dustin Lance Black the Oscar-winning screenwriter of Milk and Clint Eastwood whos acquired a few Academy statuettes of his own have collaborated with Oscar nominee Leonardo DiCaprio to exhume Hoover for a generation that may know little and care less about the antique prosecutor of felons and persecutor of civil liberties. In the mood of the directors Changeling the new film addresses a sprawling true story in frustratingly episodic terms and weaves a meticulous cocoon of period detail around a valiant but miscast star--Angelina Jolie as the working-class mom in Changeling DiCaprio as Hoover here. You might expect J. Edgar to trump The Private Files with even ballsier revelations or taking the high road more elevated insights. Instead the film manages to be both sensational and stodgy like a guided tour that goes on until it drones. In the muted artfully murky images of cinematographer Tom Stern Hoover is truly a man in the shadows a wraith the G-man as ghost. Blacks script paints Mr. FBI as triple enigma (1) a keeper and trader of state secrets who (2) zealously hoarded the secret of his presumed homosexuality and who (3) saw so dimly into his own soul that he was a secret even and especially to himself. As Eastwood told Jon Stewart on The Daily Show last night ""Hes a mystery guy as far as Im concerned."" Thats what a director should say before he makes a movie not after. J. Edgar amasses all the facts and many of the unverified suppositions but leaves its subject opaque. The movie shows its audacity or betrays its desperation by begging comparison to a pair of masterpieces. It borrows Citizen Kanes narrative structure--hopscotching from the mid-1960s when Hoover is dictating his memoirs to the Palmer Raids of 1919 and thence through the 30s (Lindbergh) early 60s (a faceoff with Robert Kennedy) the 20s (building the Bureau) more or less at whim--and to an extent Kanes multiple points of view in that it purports to be Hoovers view of himself but is transparently Blacks. Like Kane Hoover had a mother (Annie is played by Judi Dench) whom he desperately loved and who held sway on him after her death and a close male friend (Joseph Cottens Jed Leland in Kane Armie Hammers Clyde in J. Edgar) to act as his conscience confessor and foil. Hoover because he never married never had his protege-wife his Susan Alexander Kane but he is shown proposing to a young secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts excellent in the role) who would faithfully run his office until he died. Kane was of course a fictionalized biography of newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst who was still very much alive and powerful enough to make Orson Welles studio consider burning the Kane negative under threat of Hearst paper reprisals against all RKO films. The Welles film teaches that every man is a mystery to himself no less than those around him; yet Charles Foster Kane bursts off the screen in all his sad selfish and seductive contradictions. Eastwoods Hoover resists indeed repels audience involvement of either horror or a hug. He is barely even pitiable--more that cold thing in the corner that attracts little fear and less attention. Where is the fiery intensity the looming magnificence that Hoover must have radiated to secure his power from the Presidents who employed him? Later in the film J. Edgar discloses its intended affinity to another movie masterpiece Psycho. After his mothers death Hoover wears her dress talks in her voice (""You stay strong Edgar"") exactly like Hitchcocks Norman Bates. Post-mortem Annie needs two people to take her place Helen to provide the unstinting devotion Clyde the emotional intimacy. (Actually three people if you include Edgar to slip into her frocks.) Norman Bates in Robert Blochs source novel was inspired by Ed Gein the Wisconsin killer and fashioner of trophies from his victims bones. J. Edgars Hoover didnt go that far but in a way his paranoia is more frightening considering how much power he wielded. ""Oh hes psycho"" Jon Stewart said and Eastwood replied ""Well he could have been."" Sure he could have been a lot of things that make viewers shudder or sympathize or both. But this Hoover would need a more compelling script a surer directorial hand and a suitable lead actor. Besides Crawford the list of Hoover impersonators includes Ernest Borgnine (twice) Treat Williams Jack Warden Pat Hingle Bob Hoskins--all solid types at ease in their bulk and their wielding of force. DiCaprio can do many things but it takes more than ambition and good intentions for a star so young (he turns 37 this Friday) and so identified with winsome troubled heroes to slip under Hoovers skin. Literally the aging makeup DiCaprio wears as old Edger looks like parchment not epidermis; and locating the interior of the man proves equally elusive. DiCaprio does fine work in Hoovers rash marriage proposal to Helen; it shows the clumsiness of a young man who is self-conscious but not self-aware and momentarily makes the monster almost endearing. That flare of poignancy is missing from what should be the films strongest scene when Hoover and Tolson--Truman Capote dubbed them ""Johnny and Clyde""--briefly fight and Clyde kisses Edgar on his bloody mouth. Its jolting but little else. As Tolson Hammer purrs and preens ostensibly as gay as Bill Tilden but DiCaprios Hoover can take little pleasure in the nearness of the man he loves. His performance often has the feeling of a daunting assignment not an infiltration and inhabiting of the character. The lacunae in the film leave viewers spare time to wonder who might more persuasively play Hoover. Philip Seymour Hoffman? In the past decade the trio of artists responsible for this film have accomplished much DiCaprio in Gangs of New York and The Departed Black with his Harvey Milk bio-pic and some of the finest episodes of Big Love Eastwood as director and star of Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino. May they all rebound and flourish for decades more. We wouldnt put it past Clint the man wears his 81 years with handsome grace. But J. Edgar is a blot on their collective resume. Its not likely to appear on many critics year-end 10 Most Wanted list.

Photo Warner Bros/courtesy Everett Co Its lust at first sight when young FBI director John Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio in a daring and astonishing performance) gets hot and bothered while interviewing hunky recent college graduate Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) who hes told ""shows no particular interest in women. Tolson quickly became the FBIs associate director. And their tortured relationship -- apparently sexually unconsummated -- over five decades forms the crux of Clint Eastwoods ambitious and absorbing ""J. Edgar. Eastwoods fruitful collaboration with gay screenwriter and activist Dustin Lance Black (an Oscar winner for ""Milk) controversially and mostly convincingly speculates that Hoovers remarkable career was at least partially driven by his sublimated feelings. The film gives Hoover his due as a crime fighter detailing how he set up Americas national police force encouraged the use of scientific methods and fought to keep politicians out of law enforcement. Hoovers main weapon to hold off pols who questioned his aims or techniques -- including Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy -- was illegally digging up dirt on their private lives and using it for blackmail. According to this film Hoover was a repressed hypocrite and mamas boy who struggled with his own sexuality. ""Id rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a son the mother (ferociously played by Judi Dench) tells J. Edgar when he confesses his discomfort around women. The sole woman in his inner circle is the asexual Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) who serves as his loyal secretary -- maintaining his secret files for decades and destroying them after his death -- after turning down a marriage proposal on their third date. Its not easy to make Hoover -- a snoop whose lifelong obsession with communists was so all-encompassing that in the 1950s he rejected congressional demands that the FBI target organized crime which he claimed didnt exist -- a sympathetic character. But DiCaprio makes you feel for a man whos seen furtively holding hands with his everyday lunch dinner and vacation companion and -- addressing unsubstantiated rumors -- putting on his mothers dress and necklace after her death. Though the two men proclaim their love for each other in private the closest ""J. Edgar gets to explicit homoeroticism is a potent scene where Hoover tells Tolson its ""time for a Mrs. Hoover"" -- and asks for his intimate pals permission to marry actress Dorothy Lamour. Tolson explodes punches are exchanged and the two men (who are in pajamas) end up wrestling on the floor where Tolson kisses Hoover full on the mouth. ""Dont you ever do that again says Hoover. ""I wont replies Tolson. They dont kiss again but they do make up and the film follows this odd couple through middle age into their dotage (DiCaprios remarkable makeup is oddly far better than Hammers) to Hoovers death in 1972. (Tolson was his sole heir.) Even after a stroke Tolson remains Hoovers largely ineffectual conscience. Hes particularly critical of the self-serving autobiography that Hoover has been dictating over a period of years to increasingly skeptical young agents -- falsely taking credit among other things for arresting the man convicted of kidnapping the young son of Charles Lindbergh (Josh Lucas). Eastwoods depiction of what was called ""the crime of the century is disappointing -- the drama is undermined not only by its unreliable narrator (Hoover) but by a decision to cut back and forth to the FBI directors unsuccessful attempt to blackmail Martin Luther King Jr. into refusing the Nobel Peace Prize by threatening to reveal compromising audio tapes. Much more successful is the films rousing opening sequence which shows 24-year-old Hoover rising to power investigating Bolshevik bombers in 1919 Washington DC. DiCaprio may well receive a Best Actor Oscar for his tour de force as the conflicted FBI director -- greatly abetted by Hammer (who played the Winklevoss twins in ""The Social Network) in his first major role as the flamboyant but frustrated Tolson. Late in ""J. Edgar the frail FBI director -- who turns aside Tolsons plea that they retire -- remarks that ""a mans legacy depends on where the story ends. Unfortunately for Hoover his eulogy was delivered by Richard Nixon -- whose devotion to Hoovers darker practices culminated in the biggest scandal in American political history.

"J. Edgar a darkly fascinating biopic movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review J. EdgarLeonardo DiCaprios darkly fascinating performance as J. Edgar Hoover is matched by director Clint Eastwoods deft work behind the camera.November 09 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Leonardo DiCaprio as J. Edgar Hoover in Clint Eastwoods ""J.... (Keith Bernstein / Warner...)""J. Edgar"" is a somber enigmatic darkly fascinating tale and how could it be otherwise? This brooding shadow-drenched melodrama with strong political overtones examines the public and private lives of a strange tortured man who had a phenomenal will to power. A man with the keenest instincts for manipulating the levers of government he headed the omnipotent Federal Bureau of Investigation for 48 years. Though in theory he served eight presidents in practice J. Edgar Hoover served only himself. Starring an impressive Leonardo DiCaprio and crafted with Clint Eastwoods usual impeccable professionalism ""J. Edgar"" gets its power from the way the directors traditional filmmaking style interacts with the revisionist thrust of Dustin Lance Blacks script. This films J. Edgar is not the patriotic anti-Communist stalwart Hoover considered himself to be but rather someone who only imagined he was the hero of the story someone who went from outcast to oppressor by not hesitating to ride roughshod over and even blackmail whoever got in his way. Absolute power truly corrupted him absolutely. The overriding irony of this situation was that this man as rigid and self-righteous as any of the Soviet commissars he feared and fought against apparently had an unacknowledged private life that gives his story unexpected poignancy but would have made him a target of his own investigations had it been lived by someone else. Shot in a Stygian gloom by veteran Eastwood collaborator Tom Stern ""J. Edgar"" uses a news-behind-the-news structure reminiscent of ""Citizen Kane"" as it goes back and forth between Hoovers earliest days and the law unto himself he eventually became. Packed with information the film does more than ask the Shakespearean question ""Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed that he is grown so great?"" It takes its two-hour 17-minute length to show us in detail how it all came down. In this ""J. Edgar"" benefits from the convincing acting of key cast members including Naomi Watts as Helen Gandy the great mans confidential secretary and Armie Hammer (the Winklevoss twins in ""The Social Network"") as Hoovers soul mate Clyde Tolson. Most of all it benefits from DiCaprio who spent hours on set being aged from 24 to 77 had almost 80 costume changes and has the presence and force to make this American gargoyle believable. Its the graying Hoover we meet first dictating his somewhat suspect memoir to a series of young agent-stenographers because he feels that ""its time this generation learned my side of the story."" That story begins with a rarely examined event in American history the 1919 Palmer raids against anarchists and other supposed radicals. In response to a series of bombings U.S. Atty. Gen. A. Mitchell Palmer in effect took the law into his own hands collaborating with the 24-year-old Hoover and the newly formed FBI to attack people for their ideas without evidence of crimes. Its the first of several examples we see in the film of what can happen when unchecked governmental power falls into the hands of the ruthless and the self-righteous when influential people believe as Hoover did that ""sometimes you need to bend the rules a little to keep our country safe."" According to the film Hoovers character was influenced as much by his part in the raids as it was by the personality of Annie Hoover (Judi Dench) his dragon-lady mother. Dominant smothering and oddly reminiscent of Tony Perkins mother in ""Psycho"" Mrs. Hoovers homophobic insistence that ""Id rather have a dead son than a daffodil"" had a stifling effect on the other major relationship in J. Edgars life his close friendship with FBI colleague Tolson. A smooth fashion plate with the manners and attitude of the born courtier the handsome Tolson catches Hoovers eye and before you can say ""constant companion"" the two men are having lunch together every day and even taking joint vacations. The exact nature of this relationship as well as Hoovers sexuality a did he wear dresses as has been claimed or didnt he? a have been the source of near-endless speculation; at this point in time the truth is unknowable. Blacks persuasive script posits that the men definitely had strong feelings for each other but that Hoover at least could not even acknowledge let alone act on them because of his mothers inflexible attitude. This was literally the love that dared not speak its name. ""J. Edgar"" carefully takes us through the stages of Hoovers career including his realizing the publicity value of going toe-to-toe with gangsters and the way he used the distinctly outrA(c) circumstances of the kidnapping of Charles Lindbergs infant son to advance the bureaus status. We see the good things about Hoover for instance his championing of scientific crime-scene analysis and the use of fingerprints but we see much more of the dark pathological side his mania for collecting incriminating evidence on people such as John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. whom he considered the most dangerous man in America. ""We must never forget our history"" Hoover was fond of saying. ""We must never lower our guard."" But ""J. Edgar"" is best taken as a warning that in focusing too heavily on outside subversive agitators we run the risk of ignoring the depredations of people very much like Hoover himself. J.

Edgar the Man Was as Pissy as J. Edgar the Film Is Passionless and Plot-Starved You might be better off spying on neighbors than Clint Eastwoods unforgivable squandering of a great opportunity By Rex Reed  11/08/11 700pm DiCaprio as Hoover. In spite of a fusillade of P.R. overkill about what a brave risk-taking actor he is and how he spent five hours a day in a makeup chair squirming Leonardo DiCaprios portrait of a balding sweaty gristle-chewing half-mad J. Edgar Hoover is gimmicky play acting. J. Edgar Clint Eastwoods exhausting chronicle of power obsession about the enigmatic self-serving egomaniac who as director of the F.B.I. kept America trembling with terror for half a century under the phony guise of patriotism is a long tedious and hollow disappointment. Mr. Eastwood is too old to tackle a personality so complex; he knows nothing about what it takes to turn the character flaws of a cross-dressing mamas boy into an attention-craving closet queen like Hoover. And how many prosthetics do we have to endure to watch Leonardo DiCaprio fake his way through roles like Howard Hughes and the forthcoming Frank Sinatra and Jay Gatsby--roles for which he is totally unsuited and therefore miscast. For now we have another miscalculation in a bloodless film about a monster more pathetic than dangerous with an odd rambling screenplay by Oscar-winning writer Dustin Lance Black (Milk) that meanders all over the place unable to tell a story with any kind of narrative coherence. Its not that J. Edgar is such a bad movie. (Its not Melancholia.) But it is boring and ineffectual. Theres no passion behind it. From his early days in the Justice Department to his death in 1972 at age 77 the movie leans heavily on the Max Factor jar to show boyish cherubic Mr. DiCaprio in every phase of a controversial life. Some of the facts are a matter of public record. Named by Calvin Coolidge as the sixth director of what was then called the Bureau of Investigation J. Edgar rose to glory and in 1935 was appointed by U. S. Attorney General Harlan Fiske Stone (Ken Howard) as the first director of the newly organized F.B.I.--a position he assumed was ""for life."" For the next 36 years he made all the rules sodomized the Constitution declared war on everything he disliked from ""Bolshevik radicals"" to Martin Luther King set back the progress of the civil rights movement used force to root out every suspected communist and arrested 4000 people by the time he was only 24 years old. Yes he initiated a lot of crime-fighting technology including fingerprints wire-tapping and forensics labs. But he also used the F.B.I. to intimidate celebrities and public figures harass political activists and illegally collect secret files of alleged evidence and hearsay against everyone from mob bosses to Marilyn Monroe. Insanely jealous he fired staff members with poor educations and cheap wardrobes and ruined the careers of special law-enforcement agents who became heroes in the tabloids such as Chicagos Melvin Purvis the man who actually tracked down and killed John Dillinger while Hoover took all the credit and drove him to suicide in 1960. Soft-soaping his corruption the movie barely touches on these facts and refuses to take a stand on the many ways he proved himself a major hypocrite. While ranting homophobic prejudices against gays he was a closet homosexual who carried on a private love affair with assistant deputy F.B.I. director Clyde Tolson (played softly by Armie Hammer who appeared as Mark Zuckerbergs handsome twin adversaries in The Social Network). Inseparable the two men are shown kissing only one time in their 40-year relationship following a fist fight on the floor when Hoover announced he was going to marry Dorothy Lamour. Despite documented eyewitness accounts of Hoovers secret passion for cross-dressing fueled by his strong dominating mother (Judi Dench flawless again) he is revealed posing with his mothers necklace and silk dress against his chest only once following her death. (F.B.I. employees behind his back called him ""J. Edna Hoover"".) Pages 1 2 Comment Filed under america Armie Hammer Clint Eastwood fbi government J.

Edgar Cant Find the Man in the G-Man By    Alonso Duralde on November 8 2011  413 pm Follow aduralde Email Print Leonardo DiCaprio and Clint Eastwood explore the FBI founders contradictions but never reveal his soul ""J. Edgar"" assembles the talents of three people who should all think twice before doing another historical biopic -- Leonardo DiCaprio who awkwardly juggled aging makeup and a ridiculous mustache in ""The Aviator""; screenwriter Dustin Lance Black who turned the fascinating political life of Harvey Milk into a clunky series of and-then-this-happeneds in ""Milk""; and director Clint Eastwood the man behind the Charlie Parker movie ""Bird"" which bent time and space to make 161 minutes feel like several weeks. At least this time theres no mustache. Love him or hate him J. Edgar Hoover makes for an interesting character. He helped create the FBI brought down gangsters and wielded unimaginable power for decades by knowing the dirty secrets of everyone who occupied the White House during his long tenure. He carried his loathing of anarchists and Communists into the Civil Rights era where he attempted to bring down Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. with evidence of the activists sexual peccadilloes. Ironically at the same time he had an intense and lengthy relationship -- possibly never consummated -- with Clyde Tolson his close associate at the bureau. But while ""J. Edgar"" acknowledges the contradictions and the passions and the weaknesses of Hoover the movie never makes him feel like a real person. As with Blacks two previous screen biographies (""Milk"" and the TV-movie ""Pedro"" about AIDS activist Pedro Zamora) the screenplay tries to build a character by merely reciting historical incidents so were left with something closer to a monument than to an intimate portrait. We get the what but never the why. The script also uses the hoariest of framing devices with an elderly Hoover narrating his life story to a series of young FBI agents. (Theres a twist to all this but it arrives too late to make an impact.) Cue scene after scene of shaky-voiced DiCaprio talking over scene after scene of young Hoover working at the Justice Department making enemies becoming head of the newly formed FBI meeting Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) and making her his lifelong personal secretary etc. Eastwood and his team of art directors have an unfailing eye for period detail -- fetishists for vintage office supplies and stationery will be in hog heaven -- but too often the narration feels like a crutch when its not outright redundant. Hoover -- like DiCaprios Howard Hughes -- is mommy-obsessed turning to his mother (Judi Dench) for her advice and denying himself the affection of other men when she makes it clear that such a thing would be unthinkable for her. Thats bad news for Tolson (Armie Hammer gleaming like a Pepsodent model) who has lunch and dinner with Hoover every day but never gets any more physical acknowledgment than the occasional holding of hands and in Blacks telling one kiss after the two have a physical altercation. People buying a ticket to ""J. Edgar"" to see the head of the FBI presented as a cross-dresser enjoying a passionate affair with his second in command are in for a disappointment but the films portrayal of the Hoover-Tolson relationship actually rings true. Even if the two of them were gay the times and their own personal programming would never allow them to do anything but repress their urges and make whatever life they could within the confines of 1930s Washington D.C. It certainly helps this part of the story that Hammer gives the films most relatable performance. With DiCaprio buried under equally thick layers of old-age putty and clunky narration Hammer makes Tolson into a real person swept up in Hoovers charisma and power and content to live his life in the other mans shadow. So much of ""J. Edgar"" drags by at an interminable pace that I found myself thinking about moments from Harry Shearers hilarious radio musical ""J. Edgar"" which featured Kelsey Grammer as Hoover and John Goodman as Tolson. While that satirical piece obviously exaggerates the facts here and there its the Hoover who attacks his enemies in song who feels more memorable and more complex than the one DiCaprio gives us.

Edgar Wednesday November 9 2011 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - A resounding ""yes"" to the question trembling on every lip There is life after Hereafter Clint Eastwood goes deep into Oliver Stone territory and emerges victorious with J. Edgar. Although hardly flawless Eastwoods biopic is his richest most ambitious movie since the Letters From Iwo Jima-Flags of Our Fathers duo if not Unforgiven.Does anyone under the age of 50 even remember the man who more or less created the FBI and successfully ran the agency for nearly half a century? Patriot scoundrel genius of self-promotion gangbuster red-baiter blackmailer proponent of the fingerprint apostle of the wiretap keeper of the crypt and mommas boy monster of sexual repression J. Edgar Hoover (1895-1972) was one of the great American personalities of the 20th century. (""Hes sick cruel dogmatic stupid racist. . . . Everything I like in a character"" Sam Fuller once said.) Hoover is also a figure who for the 81-year-old Eastwood must have been a childhood hero and perhaps later a Dirty Harry ego-ideal as the guy who would break any law to defend The Law.Hoover has already been splendidly embodied by Broderick Crawford in Larry Cohens 1977 pulp masterpiece The Private Files of J. Edgar Hoover. But with prosthetics simulating Hoovers bulldog look the better to enact the FBI mans bulldog tenacity Leonardo DiCaprio turns out to have been a quite canny casting move. With his own celebrity presence DiCaprio successfully promotes the movies idea of Hoover as a star (rather than the squat balding troll familiar to anyone who grew up in the 60s) even as he makes convincing the sexual ambiguity crucial to the Hoover conceived by Eastwood and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black.Black who won an Oscar for Milk has furnished Eastwood with a complex richly associative script that puts the first 20 years of Hoovers career (the 1920s and 30s) in the context of his last decade (the 1960s) with flashbacks motivated by the memoir he dictates to a succession of young agents. Crammed with material even if the midsection is a bit slack J. Edgar is a dense historical tapestry. Everyone from Emma Goldman and Shirley Temple to Norman Schwarzkopf Sr. and H.R. Haldeman gets a cameo but its all in the service of historical perspective. The bombs that triggered the 1919 Palmer Raids foreshadow the events of and fallout from 9/11 (""the crimes were investigating are not crimes but ideas"" someone complains) even as the Hoover of 1961 looks back on the post-World War I Red Scare as a harbinger of the civil rights movement and its supposedly communist-directed leader Martin Luther King. Its ""just like today"" Hoover more than once notes.Like most Eastwood productions J. Edgar is frugal and underlit; like his better films it has an undercurrent of nuttiness. The movies closing thought ""Love is the greatest force on earth."" So yes J. Edgar provides an almost credible theory of the great mans sexuality. The movie might have done more with his fascinated horror of female criminality from Ma Barker to Angela Davis; still when propositioned at age 35 by an eager movie starlet and then asked to dance by Ginger Rogerss mother Hoover runs home in terror to his battle-ax mom (Judi Dench). ""Id rather have a dead son than a live daffodil"" she snarls and teaches him a rudimentary fox-trot. Eastwood sees Hoovers relation to the women in his life as key--he early forms a crucial bond with his sternly asexual personal secretary Helen Gandy (self-effacingly played by Naomi Watts)--but his most important relationship is with designated best friend Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer). Discreetly campy for most of the movie Hammer throws a magnificent tantrum upon learning that his soul mate is contemplating marriage with Hollywood sarongster Dorothy Lamour.Indeed Hollywood is never far away. Just as Hoover is several times accused of fabricating media stories and turning himself into a fictional hero J. Edgar is a self-aware production filled with its own textual signposts. There are flashes of Jimmy Cagney as a gangster in Public Enemy and a cop in G-Men. Other references are simply playful Edgar and Clyde bond while shopping for clothes at a mens store named Julius Garfinkle (given name of blacklisted star John Garfield) and the word ""nelly"" leaps out of a courtroom display at a kidnapping trial. J. Edgar not only references Citizen Kane but in Edgars mother-loving antics Psycho. Theres even a nod to The Matrix when Hoover begins dictating his memoirs to one Agent Smith (not unfortunately played by Hugo Weaving).Most generously J. Edgar also acknowledges Cohens Private Files which posited Hoover as the black widow spider of American politics who orchestrated everything from the assassination of Robert Kennedy to the fall of Richard Nixon. In effect Eastwood has given Cohens movie a prequel. Watching Nixons inauguration Edgar is seized with anticipatory dread ""We must never forget our history. We must never lower our guard."" He is of course using the royal we. Upon learning of Hoovers death the first thing Nixon does is tell his flunky ""I want those fucking files.""

Edgar Hoover is a challenge to deconstruct and a complex subject for a standard biopic.Keith Bernstein APJ. Edgar delves into the public and personal life of former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover (played by Leonardo DiCaprio).EnlargeCloseKeith Bernstein APJ. Edgar delves into the public and personal life of former FBI director J. Edgar Hoover (played by Leonardo DiCaprio).Sponsored LinksBut director Clint Eastwood never makes standard fare. With J. Edgar he and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black avoid the predictable approaching the subject from an unexpected angle. While the FBI director is held accountable for his paranoia and megalomania hes also portrayed as a victim of his time and the cruelties of an overbearing mother.VIDEO Watch the trailerMORE With J. Edgar Eastwood again flexes his freedomHoover served for 37 years as head of the FBI and the film jumps back and forth in time. Eastwood illuminates what drove Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) by examining his relationships with his longtime partner bureau deputy Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer); his mother Annie (Judi Dench); and his dedicated secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts).Black who won an Oscar for his screenplay of Milk has crafted a complex portrayal of Hoover and Tolson framed within the context of a love story.Consequently audiences get a nuanced portrait. Eastwood certainly focuses on what Hoover is known best for -- his wiretaps and secret files. Yet by seeing his interactions with those closest to him audiences get a glimpse into Hoovers tortured psyche. What emerges is a portrait of a man often selfish and childish in his insistence on absolute loyalty whose moral outrage was largely built on baseless fears.About the movieJ. Edgar  out of fourStars Leonardo DiCaprio Armie Hammer Naomi Watts Judi Dench Josh Lucas Director Clint EastwoodDistributor Warner Bros.Pictures Rating R for brief strong language Running time 2 hours and 17 minutes Opens Wednesday in Los Angeles and Friday in New YorkDench is superb as the emotionally corrosive mother who prodded him to distinguish himself but also taunted him with tales of a man nicknamed ""Daffy"" because he liked to dress up in womens clothes. The film ages DiCaprio convincingly Hammer less so. Still Hammer almost steals the show. While DiCaprio has some noteworthy scenes its tough to forget its the actor playing Hoover. In contrast Hammer and Watts disappear into more subtle roles.J. Edgar shines a probing beam of light on a man who was widely feared often disliked but rarely understood.

Edgar Hoover and Armie Hammer as Clyde Tolson in J. Edgar (/) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday November 8 2011 1200 PM Title J. Edgar Film Info With Leonardo DiCaprio Armie Hammer Naomi Watts. Biopic of FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. Director Clint Eastwood (217). R Violence language. At area theaters. Despite over two hours worth of recalling recanting stonewalling and bullying the secrets that lie at the heart of ""J. Edgar"" remain hidden. That may be because director Clint Eastwoods movie is of two minds about J. Edgar Hoover. The longtime FBI ""head cop"" is a hard-working but narrow-minded patriot an upholder of a limited definition of honor and a corruptible battler of corruption. That can be a plus in a bio-pic but in a movie whose scope is several decades worth of law and order fair-mindedness often turns into fuzzy noncommitment. At least Leonardo DiCaprio grounded and sure has commitment to spare. His portrayal of Hoover is undeniably terrific. The film is built around a stodgy narrative device the famous man telling his tale to a biographer as the 60-ish Hoover (DiCaprio in rubbery old-man makeup hes able to transcend) recounts his advancement in 1919 from a Justice Department lawyer into the Bureau of Investigation as it was known. He targets and deports ""radical"" immigrants based on the suspicion but not fact of criminal intent. Its an area Hoover with his many distrusts and walled-off emotional life takes to easily. Hoover is leading the bureau before hes 30. Still living with his mother (Judi Dench) in a Washington townhouse he aims the re-named Federal Bureau of Investigation against gangsters and bootleggers. He takes credit for capturing Lindbergh baby kidnapper Bruno Hauptmann makes his ""G-Men"" into pop-cultural figures and falls into a denial-filled love with Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) the dewy-eyed assistant director he hand-picked for the F.B.I. The script by Dustin Lance Black (""Milk"") dodges specificity in Hoover and Tolsons relationship; to us as to the world theyre confidantes co-crusaders and soulmates though never a couple. But they are always together as ""J. Edgar"" toggles between the 1960s -- when Hoover is an omnipotent Establishment boogeyman targeting the Kennedys and Martin Luther King -- and the 1930s as he Tolson and Hoovers secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) oversee the use of fingerprinting and DNA evidence in crime cases and begin keeping incriminating files on prominent Americans. The no-nonsense libertarian Eastwood whose steady hand is felt here in a way it wasnt in ""Hereafter"" or ""Invictus"" doesnt paint Hoover in vivid strokes (despite some parallels between Hoovers anti-immigrant status and post-9/11 concerns) yet oddly his shades-of-gray approach runs counter to Blacks old-fashioned script full as it is of people telling not showing the influence Hoover had on the nation. Still Eastwood and cinematographer Tom Stern create a shadowy world of justice decided upon in smoky conference rooms on restaurant banquettes and via secret recordings. And DiCaprio our most underappreciated major actor superbly fills in the blanks where the script fails. He does it with the un-Hoover-like traits of dignity subtlety and clarity hiding nothing but the truth. Magic Moment Hoover orchestrates a gangsters arrest so that he can appear to be a gun-wielding hero.

E-mail| Print| Text size - + In Clint Eastwoods new film ""J. Edgar"" a 1930 movie theater audience makes its preference clear. Whereas J. Edgar Hoovers pre-movie promotion reel about G-men and the FBI draws impatient boos a trailer for the upcoming James Cagney flick ""The Public Enemy"" inspires hoots and applause.Though Hoover was exceptionally popular with the American public throughout his nearly four decade reign as FBI director his opponents -- the gangsters the radicals the Kennedys -- have always been the chosen subjects of movies.""J. Edgar"" too may not draw cheers but it remains a riveting noble attempt by Eastwood now 81 to wrestle with big American questions many of which have obvious relevance to todays politics. Its another largely fascinating if disappointingly flawed chapter in Eastwoods fantastic late period.""J. Edgar"" is a biopic framed around Hoover (a thoroughly committed engaging but ultimately still removed Leonardo DiCaprio) dictating his life story to various typists. This is Hoovers story mainly told through his perspective -- and therefore a somewhat claustrophobic view of history.The film from an ambitious script by Dustin Lance Black (who wrote the Harvey Milk biopic ""Milk"") opens with a lot of switches in time as the narrative rushes to pack in the rise of Hoover as a Justice Department upstart and eager riser at the nascent Bureau of Investigation. Its a grimly propulsive first hour pushed forward by the relentless paranoid patter of the fast-talking Hoover (nicknamed ""Speed"").Hoover is fully formed from the start A meticulous obsessive defender of America (or what he conceives as America). He tries to make typist Helen Gandy (the wonderful Naomi Watts here underused looking too bright for a somber tale) his wife but when she declines he makes her his lifelong trusted secretary instead.""Edgar can you keep a secret?"" Gandy explaining her career goals asks -- and somewhere five decades of American politicians chortle.Eastwood makes an effort to show the post-World War I political climate by which Hoover was formed -- the bombings and assassination attempts that would ignite his long ""war against the Bolsheviks."" The point perhaps is that the threat was not just paranoia -- but was still far from the ""end of times"" warnings that echoed not unlike they have in contemporary times.Hoover will continue this fight throughout eventually mistaking other movements (such as the civil rights movement -- Hoover a racist would call Martin Luther King Jr. ""the most notorious liar in the country"") for extensions of communism. Whereas many biopics chart a persons arc across history ""J. Edgar"" follows historys arc across Hoovers bullheaded steadiness.Eastwood explores Hoovers increasing megalomania his illegal surveillance his secret files. By the time Nixon is elected president Hoover ironically recognizes him as a ""menace"" who will do anything to keep power. But Eastwood also reminds us of Hoovers accomplishments. Hoover built a centralized collection of fingerprints in Washington and was an early advocate of forensics. He brought professionalism to FBI agents but also presided over them like a dictator insisting they shave any facial hair and wear suits to his liking (Hoover almost dandyish kept to his Brooks Brothers). He was an early publicity innovator creating a mythologized ""G-Man"" -- not to mention an exaggerated Hoover.Still the most affecting parts of ""J. Edgar"" are Hoovers two most important personal relationships That with his mother (Judi Dench) and with his No. 2 and close friend Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer who after being digitally doubled for ""The Social Network"" has been restored to a singular being).Hoover was an emphatic mamas boy and Dench plays her as a kind of Lady Macbeth fostering her sons repression. When a grown Hoover gets worked up and begins stuttering were cast back into the ""The Kings Speech"" She tells him like she did when he was a child to talk to himself in the mirror and ""Be my little Speedy.""The exact nature of Hoovers relationship with Tolson isnt known. They ate together nearly every day and took vacations together but the gay and cross-dressing rumors about Hoover arent established.In ""J. Edgar"" the relationship is entirely convincing. Hoover and Tolson (Hammer plays him as totally subservient to Hoover) are inseparable partners but their sexual desires -- while not spelled out -- appear to be unsatisfied. Blacks interest in Hoovers story is that of a closeted gay man as opposed to the outed Milk. DiCaprio and Hammer have an excellent chemistry full of slight homoerotic gestures.It can and surely will be argued how accurate it is to portray Hoover this way. The politics of the film will also be debated given that Eastwood a moderate libertarian Republican is sympathetic to Hoover (felt most in his loving mediocre piano score).But just as the director so caringly switched sides of a World War II battlefield for ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" after ""Flags of Our Fathers"" Eastwoods ""J. Edgar"" shows just as much empathy for the power broker as ""Changeling"" did for the aggrieved.In ""J. Edgar"" Eastwood and cinematographer Tom Stern fill the interiors with deep shadows and desaturated colors. That adds to the weighty feel of a biopic which remains -- when conventional -- a problematic form for movies not enough time to fit a life and too much material to find a narrative. ""J. Edgar"" struggles to put forth a full picture of Hoover a failure Blacks screenplay attempts to shroud in the contrived flashbacks.DiCaprio has no hesitation about the biopic and he does a great deal to make ""J. Edgar"" a compelling one. Thanks to Deborah Hoppers excellent costumes he plays the character across decades (as Hammer and Watts do as well). Hes most striking almost Orson Welles-ish as the elderly Hoover.And really its the experience of aging -- a subject of many of Eastwoods recent films -- that comes across best with ""J. Edgar."" The resonating images of Hoover are of a man increasingly and tragically out of step with time. Thankfully its been quite the opposite for Eastwood.""J. Edgar"" a Warner Bros.

Edgar."" By David Denby G-men Armie Hammer and Leonardo DiCaprio.   Credit Illustration by Thomas Ehretsmann Clint Eastwoods ""J. Edgar"" is of all things a portrait of a soul. The movie is a nuanced account of J. Edgar Hoover (Leonardo DiCaprio) as a sympathetic monster a compound of intelligence repression and misery--a man whose inner turmoil tamed and sharpened irrupts in authoritarian fervor. Eastwood and the screenwriter Dustin Lance Black have re-created that period in the nineteen-twenties and thirties when a righteous young man with a stentorian style could electrify a nation. Outraged by scattered bomb plots and shifting values--what seems to him the moral chaos of modern life--Hoover senses that Americans need safety or at least the illusion of safety and he becomes the vessel of their protection exercising and justifying with ironclad rhetoric his own dominance. The movie has the structure of a conventional bio-pic. It begins in 1919 when the twenty-four-year-old Hoover employed by the Justice Department to track ""alien subversives"" shows up on his bicycle at the Washington house of his boss Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer after it has been bombed by anarchists. The film traces Hoovers rise from that shocking moment his creation of the F.B.I. within the Justice Department; his corrupt and intimidating hold on the directorship; his successes failures and phobias; and his shaky last days. Yet ""J. Edgar"" is saved from the usual stiffness of the bio-pic form by the emotionally unsettled nature of its hero a man vamped and controlled by his mother (Judi Dench) and afraid of his own sexuality yet desperate for companionship. For decades Hoover works at the Bureau with Clyde Tolson (Armie Hammer) and carries on a chaste love affair with him. The two natty gents go to clubs and the races together and spend weekends chaffing quarrelling and pledging their affections. This Hoover is a tyrant a liar and a prig but he is also in his impacted way capable of love. ""J. Edgar""--a collaboration with the activist gay screenwriter of ""Milk""--represents another remarkable turn in Clint Eastwoods career. Remarkable but not altogether surprising. Eastwood long ago gave up celebrating men of violence the mysterious annihilating Westerners and the vigilantes who think that they alone know how to mete out justice. But Clean Edgar working with an efficient state apparatus behind him is a lot more dangerous than Dirty Harry. As the filmmakers tell it the roots of Hoovers manias lie in his nature. The movie bears a thematic resemblance to Bernardo Bertoluccis ""The Conformist"" (1970) in which a repressed homosexual (Jean-Louis Trintignant) in the nineteen-thirties longing for ""normality"" joins the Italian Fascist Party and operates as an amoral bullyboy. ""J. Edgar"" is the story of how a similarly repressed personality might operate in a democracy. The answer is privately by accumulating secrets and blackmailing anyone who is even remotely a threat to his standing; and publicly by making himself and his outfit pop-culture icons and then bending the government to his whim. The frame for the movie is the Director in old age dictating the story of his career to a series of young men from the Bureau. Black and Eastwood use this plot device ironically Hoover is an exceptionally unreliable narrator and the way Eastwood stages the actual events suggests that Hoover is pumping up his own role and stretching the truth. The dark-toned cinematography by Tom Stern is as redolent of the past as old leather and walnut. The images are heavily shadowed with faces often seen half in darkness a visual hint that these people do not know themselves very well. Hoovers ethics and his style are traditionalist in tone but radical in application. He flourishes at a time when powerful men are perfectly groomed and dressed--and cloaked in secrecy. Fanatically dedicated to appearances they are fooling themselves perhaps as much as others. In the movies portrait of pre-electronic America Hoover pierces those appearances with wiretaps bugs and the lowly file card an early database that aided by his longtime secretary Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) he wields to devastating effect. Nonetheless Hoover is fixated on his own image and on that of the Bureau. Outraged that the public is enjoying the panache of Jimmy Cagney as a gangster in such early-thirties pictures as ""The Public Enemy"" Hoover lends his name and his support to Hollywood films and by the middle of the decade Cagney is firing a gun on behalf of the government. Hoover may be treated semi-satirically but neither Black nor Eastwood suggests that the dangers and the national weaknesses he combatted early in his career were illusory. In 1920 crime detection was primitive. Hoover insists that the country needs an armed national police force and modern forensic methods--a fingerprint bank up-to-date labs and the like. Bursting into rooms at the Justice Department and shouting down objections he orders equipment space and training and holds everyone to account. His new scientific methods lead in 1934 to the capture of Bruno Hauptmann the kidnapper of the Lindbergh baby. The complicated story of the Bureau is dramatized in flashes as an emanation of Hoovers will. This technique is inadequate as history but almost inevitable in a movie. What interests Black and Eastwood more than institutional lore is what Hoover did with the power he accumulated. Again and again he goes too far treating Communist rhetorical bluster as the first stages of revolution assembling lists of people whose opinions he considers suspect fabricating documents planting stories in the newspapers bludgeoning potential enemies with his file drawers of sexual gossip. A single scene with Robert F. Kennedy (Jeffrey Donovan)--in the early sixties when as Attorney General he was Hoovers boss--stands in for Hoovers relations with the various Presidents who longed to be rid of him but didnt dare show him the door. Hoover tells Kennedy that he has evidence of his brothers sexual escapades with dubious women and his job remains intact. His smarmy prurience becomes a factor in national policy. He and Tolson giggle over an intercepted letter to Eleanor Roosevelt from Lorena Hickok the reporter who became Roosevelts close friend and possibly her lover. As an old man he holes up in a room to listen to tape recordings of Martin Luther King Jr. having sex with a woman in a hotel. Eastwood stages the sexual scene as shadows on a wall. Hoovers immobile fascinated face is the obscene element in the episode. The film moves fast but Eastwoods touch is light and sure his judgment sound the moments of pathos held just long enough. And he cast the right star as his equivocal hero-fool. In the past such beetle-browed heavyweights as Broderick Crawford Ernest Borgnine and Bob Hoskins have played Hoover. By using DiCaprio and then aging him with prosthetic makeup Eastwood lets us see how a slender good-looking young man might thicken and coarsen with years and power. DiCaprio extending his vowels into a Washington drawl (Hoover was a local boy) focusses energy in his bulldog forehead; the body increasingly sausage-packed into tight-fitting suits as Hoover gets older is immobile unused mere weight. DiCaprio never burlesques Hoover but when he meets Armie Hammers Tolson in his office for the first time he breaks into a sweat. Hammer--tall handsome suave yet gentle with a sweet smile--gives a charming soft-shoe performance that in a memorable scene explodes into jealous rage. Hoover was in power for almost fifty years and the filmmakers leave out many particulars of his reign. Despite frequent references to Hoovers loathing of Communism (which he convinces himself is poisoning the civil-rights movement) Eastwood and Black omit his active role in the rise of the Red-baiting pols Joseph McCarthy and Richard Nixon. The filmmakers concentrate on the Bureaus successes in capturing or killing the tommy-gun bank robbers of the thirties but overlook Hoovers odd and possibly corrupt unwillingness to take organized crime seriously even as in the forties and fifties the Mafia was draining millions from the economy. Liberals will find much in the movie that condemns Hoovers trampling of civil liberties but may be dismayed by the insistence that an emerging national power needed a secret police force. Gay activists may be disappointed by the filmmakers restrained assumptions about Hoovers sexuality though the destructive effects of self-denial have rarely been dramatized in such withering detail. Hoover we realize is obsessed with keeping America safe because he feels unsafe himself. Internal subversion is a personal not just a political threat to him. No stranger man--not even Nixon--has ever been at the center of an American epic.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Edgar.  (Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) It turns out that he is in part having hidden his true homosexual nature for so long that hes phony through and through. The thrust of J. Edgar is that many of the U.S. governments most dangerous tendenciesamong them flagrant disregard for civil libertiesare rooted in a closeted gay mans terror of being exposed especially to his mother. From that terror came Hoovers obsession with ferreting out other peoples secrets amassing private files on presidents and using them as leverage to remain in power. And the man who made sure that his bureau projected an aura of manly fitness struggled with the impulse to sashay around the house in dresses and pearl necklaces. See Also Armie Hammer on Playing Clyde Tolson in J. Edgar You might wonder Who is the gay pinko subversive director behind this Tommy-gun assault on our national security and masculinity? Clint Eastwood of course. J. Edgar is the latest chapter in Eastwoods never-ending project to deconstruct the macho jingoist homophobic right-wing archetype he once embodiedand prove himself an artist whose simplicity of style belies the most sophisticated understanding of the dual nature of the American character of any living filmmaker. Thats the theory anyway. Its too bad J. Edgar is so shapeless and turgid and ham-handed so rich in bad lines and worse readings. Not DiCaprio though As you get used to (and correct for) his artifice you appreciate his guts and honesty. Theres something appealingly straightforward about the way he physicalizes Hoovers inner struggle the body always slightly out of sync with the mind that vigilantly monitors every move. The same cant be said alas for Armie Hammer as Hoovers beloved Clyde Tolson. Hes fine as the smugly entitled pretty boy but hopeless under speckled makeup that makes him look more like a burn victim than a senior citizen. Is there a merit badge for self-effacement? Give it to Naomi Watts as Hoovers lifelong secretary who has few lines but is frequently held in the frame so we can register her conflict between loyalty to her boss and to the Constitution of the United States. Direction this ponderous exposes all the contrivances in Blacks script like surrounding the aged Hoover with agents who while taking dictation interrupt to query the legality of his methods. Those damn liberals are everywhere The bleached-out scenes in the teens twenties and thirties strongly suggest that God had yet to invent colorbut late in the film theres a postmodern twist that reveals our narrator as unreliable. With direction as unvaried as Eastwoods you cant tell whats purposefully bogus and whats inept. And does Blacks gay through line get in the way of the story? Apart from one derisive line about Joe McCarthy theres nothing about HUAC or the blacklist when the FBI and Congress worked hand in hand to trash the First Amendment. I did love Judi Dench as Mrs. Hoover who at one point announces Id rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a sonto which J. Edgar replies Yes mother. A carriage that formidable would scare anyone straight. Melancholia Directed by Lars von Trier. R. J. Edgar Directed by Clint Eastwood. R.

Edgar Peter Debruge Chief Film Critic AskDebruge 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr November 3 2011 | 1100PM PT Any movie in which the longtime FBI honcho features as the central character must supply some insight into what made him tick or suffer from the reality that the Bureaus exploits were far more interesting than the bureaucrat who ran it -- a dilemma ""J. Edgar"" never rises above. J. Edgar Hoovers mystique lies in the fact that while he kept meticulous files with compromising details on some of Americas most powerful figures nobody knew the mans own secrets. Therefore any movie in which the longtime FBI honcho features as the central character must supply some insight into what made him tick or suffer from the reality that the Bureaus exploits were far more interesting than the bureaucrat who ran it -- a dilemma ""J. Edgar"" never rises above. With Leonardo DiCaprio bringing empathy to the controversial Washington power-monger Clint Eastwoods old-school biopic should do solid midrange business. In 1993 Anthony Summers published a tawdry expose titled ""Official and Confidential the Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover"" which aired Susan Rosenstiels claim that she had witnessed Hoover a lifelong bachelor who was seldom seen without trusted deputy Clyde Tolson wearing a cocktail dress at a gay orgy in New York. Though never corroborated the claim stuck and the legacy of this much-feared public figure -- who served as FBI director under eight presidents across 48 years and through some of the most trying cases of the 20th century -- is now dominated by associations with cross-dressing. If the assumptions about his sex life are true that would make ""J. Edgar"" the story of the highest-ranking homosexual in American history produced by a major Hollywood studio and directed by one of the industrys most venerable directors -- hardly insignificant in an industry that goes to great lengths to obfuscate the sexuality of its own stars. While not exactly coy Eastwoods classically styled look at Hoovers life takes a long time to arrive at questions of the characters proclivities. When it does get there however this new dimension of the character so enlivens what has been a mostly dry portrayal of one mans crusade to reform law enforcement that it becomes the pics focus. True to Eastwoods understated nature ""J. Edgar"" offers the ""tasteful"" treatment of such potentially salacious subject matter though a more outre Oliver Stone-like approach might have made for a livelier film. With the exception of a few profanities (enough to land the pic an audience-limiting R rating) and a lone homoerotic wrestling scene so tame that Ken Russells ""Women in Love"" feels like an X by comparison the film could pass for something Warners would have released in an earlier era -- earlier even than many of the events depicted onscreen as suggested by Tom Sterns cinematography desaturated nearly to black-and-white. Eastwoods restraint applies to not only the kid-gloves depiction of how Hoover slyly manipulated politicos and press including a loathsome attempt to blackmail Martin Luther King Jr. into declining the Nobel Peace Prize but also to his oddly nonjudgmental approach to Hoovers sexual identity depicting him as a man too Puritanical to pursue intimacy with someone of either gender. As he did with ""Milk"" screenwriter Dustin Lance Black follows the print-the-legend philosophy building to what could have been the ultimate tragic love story between two men Johnny and Clyde (as Truman Capote dubbed Hoover and Tolson) companions for the better part of five decades who never had the chance to express their affection -- a consequence of Hoovers insistence that FBI employees live up to the strictest code of conduct (he wouldnt even allow them to drink coffee on the job). The opening reel establishes both the scope of the story which ranges from Hoovers 20s to his final days overseeing the FBI at age 77 and DiCaprios remarkable ability to play the character at any point along that timeline. Aided by a convincing combination of facial appliances makeup and wigs the thesp draws auds past that gimmick and into the character within a matter of a few scenes. Theres an innate kindliness to DiCaprio that makes for a more likable protagonist than Hoover as the tempestuous monster so many biographers describe which is good news for the films commercial prospects but seemingly at odds with reality. Surely this cant be the glory hound who collaborated with Sen. Joseph McCarthy on his anti-communist witch hunt and called King ""the most notorious liar in the country"" nor the same FBI chief accused of racism (the Bureau antagonized civil-rights leaders and employed few blacks) homophobia (gays were dismissed from service) and sexism (women were allowed to serve as secretaries and assistants but never agents). Rather than seriously engaging with any of these common accusations Blacks script skips back and forth through Hoovers CV alternating public grandstanding with invented insights into his private life. Annie Hoover (Judi Dench) exerts enormous control over her sons personality telling him ""Id rather have a dead son than a daffodil for a son"" in the films most chilling scene. Tolson (Armie Hammer) whose prissiness accounts for the films scant laughs also surfaces early lurking behind the frosted-glass door to an adjoining office while Hoover dictates a self-aggrandizing book. Considering how critical any other characters perspective might be allowing Hoover to narrate his own story comes as a generous gift from Black. Hoovers voiceover gives form to a story that starts out as an institutionally approved version of how the FBI came to be punctuated every so often by a high-profile arrest or newfangled forensic development (an investigation into the kidnapping of Charles Lindberghs son supplies the sort of procedural intrigue that comes comfortably to Eastwood). As the pic progresses however Hoovers words grow increasingly defensive and the episodes drift into far more personal territory. Since you cant put a face on the love interest in a workaholics story Black must manufacture romance on the margins. In the first act Hoover briefly courts Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) an office girl who declines his marriage proposal on their third date but agrees to become his secretary. A short time later Hoover meets Tolson in a scene staged to suggest love at first sight. As written Tolsons character is clearly gay but Eastwood seems noncommittal about Hoover. Certainly there are clues in nearly every aspect of the production from Deborah Hoppers ever-dapper wardrobe to the meticulously appointed sets overseen by James Murakami and decorated by Gary Fettis. At one point auds catch a glimpse of the entry stairwell to Hoovers home where a framed portrait of his mother hangs alone. Whats missing from this picture? Why the famous nude photo of Marilyn Monroe that hung in the real-life Hoovers hallway. J. EdgarProductionA Warner Bros. release and presentation of an Imagine Entertainment Malpaso production.

A surprising collaboration that tackles its trickiest challenges with plausibility and good sense while serving up a simmeringly caustic view of its controversial subjects behavior public and private. TWITTER Written by Dustin Lance Black the Warner Bros. film features Armie Hammer Judi Dench and Naomi Watts as the historic FBI Boss closest companions. Arcing across a tumultuous half-century of American history while conjuring intimate glimpses of a high-profile public figure who hid his own secrets as well as he collected those of others J. Edgar is a mightily ambitious work that provokes a host of assorted reactions Simultaneous fascination and revulsion for the autocratic longtime head of the FBI pity for someone so incapable of coming to terms with his true nature grudging respect for his professional skills outweighed by disdain for his tactics and prejudices admiration for how deftly the filmmakers have treated the conjectural aspects of the most intimate scenes and impatience with the scripts tendency to tell rather than show. PHOTOS J. Edgar Premiere Red Carpet Arrivals This surprising collaboration between director Clint Eastwood and Milk screenwriter Dustin Lance Black tackles its trickiest challenges with plausibility and good sense while serving up a simmeringly caustic view of its controversial subjects behavior public and private. Big-name talent behind and in front of the camera led by a committed performance by Leonardo DiCaprio in the title role assures extensive media attention and public curiosity up to a point. But Warner Bros. faces a significant commercial challenge in stirring the interest of younger audiences likely to regard J. Edgar Hoover as an irrelevant artifact of the bad old days or most reductively a hypocritical closet case. PHOTOS Fall Movies 2011 Warner Bros. These days agenda counts for so much to so many and the pressing if not only point of interest for some constituencies will be to see how far the film goes in ascribing all manner of nefarious and/or hypocritical behavior to this most public symbol of moral rectitude patriotic thinking and law abidance; for some nothing short of an unrestrained evisceration will do. But pulling Hoovers pants down and sticking him on a skewer 39 years after his death would not be Eastwoods way. Rather to this complex drama he applies the same sort of measured intelligence he has brought to bear on any number of his films to assess and analyze the unjust application of justice the suitable response to violence or its threat and the temptation for an individual to flaunt the rules and either take the law into ones own hands or bend it to suit ones own purposes. Eastwood has often gravitated toward characters inclined to extreme unilateral behavior and Hoovers ability to run the FBI has his personal fiefdom for nearly half a century indisputably qualifies him as a prime example of such a figure. THR COVER STORY The Making of J. Edgar Unfortunately Hoover led a life so narrow and unchanging both emotionally and ideologically as to prevent screenwriter Black from making him a character available to dramatic revelation. His stature notwithstanding Hoover cant even be considered an alluringly complicated anti-hero along the lines of Charles Foster Kane to reference a film with which J. Edgar shares some unmissable structural historical and tempermental parallels. A bulldog who more closely resembled a pug Hoover can be credited with many innovations in law enforcement. But he was also a vengeful suspicious racist egomaniac a man who kept his grip on power by getting the goods on anyone especially presidents who might try to bring him down. He was also a fastidious self-righteous public tough guy who lived with his mother until she died and may or may not have been intimately involved with his longtime partner and professional second-in-command Clyde Tolson portrayed here in excellent if rather glamorized fashion by Armie Hammer. The truth about the domestic relationship is probably forever unknowable but the way the homoerotic undertones and impulses are handled is one of the best things about the film; the emotional dynamics given all the social and political factors at play feel entirely credible and the DiCaprio and Hammer excel during the exchanges of innuendo covert desire recriminations and mutual understanding. STORY J. Edgar Qamp;A Leonardo DiCaprio Built around a core of the old Hoover dictating a memoir to a series of noticeably good-looking well-groomed young men the script hopscotches throughout history to focus on key episodes in the mans life that either significantly shaped his world view or played a role in the development of the FBI Post-World War I radical violence that forged his anti-communism and his lifelong obsession with domestic threats; the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and murder case which he used to strengthen the bureau and sharply extend its reach; his self-glorifying efforts to put himself in the front line battling famous Depression-era gangsters and his determination to obtain trump cards on perceived adversaries such as FDR JFK and Martin Luther King Jr. in the form of incriminating sexual documents and recordings. Layered through the historical pageant is a personal life notable for its self-repression and timidity. A mamas boy whose mother (Judi Dench) comes off like a rancid version of a controlling Tennessee Williams matriarch the young Hoover is once seen taking the attractive Helen Gandy (Naomi Watts) on a weird date in the Library of Congress where he shows off his advanced cataloguing skills. When his romantic advances are rebuffed he recoups by offering her a job as his personal secretary a highly confidential position she crucially maintains until after his death when she (as shown here) shreds her bosss private files before Nixons goons arrive to seize them. STORY J. Edgar Qamp;A Clint Eastwood Other than an affair Hoover claims with actress Dorothy Lamour there are no other known women. But there was Clyde Tolson an undistinguished but at least as represented by Hammer very tall and handsome candidate for an agency job who quickly becomes the bosss regular dinner partner and number two man. Sharing a hotel suite for the races at Del Mar powerfully brings their relationship to the brink after which they reach an understanding. The upshot is that very few people are as famous for the sex they probably didnt have as other people are for the sex they actually did have. As drama J. Edgar gets off to a bit of a choppy start as it rapidly introduces a host of names and characters its hard to keep track of while bouncing from 1919 to the 1960s and back again with Hoovers voiceover attempting to clarify whats going on. DiCaprios changing looks across the decades also takes some getting used to; while his old-age makeup seems jarring at first one gradually looks beyond it and the actor is actually most effective in the middle and late-age scenes. Hoovers manner of speaking is unusual in itself; its carefully enunciated with an aggressive drive and no identifiable regional affiliation evidently all carefully cultivated to compensate for early stuttering. He also has dark soulless mahogany eyes and a chunky body some praise as ""solid."" STORY How Makeup Transformed Leonardo DiCaprio Into J. Edgar DiCaprio projects this odd authority figure with energetic earnestness a strong grip on the mans mindset and purpose and an attentiveness to Hoovers power to prevail over others in matters big and small. Its a vigorous capable performance one that carries the film and breathes new life into the old tradition of plain real folk achieving retroactive allure by being played by attractive stars. But the characterization remains external one of solid technique blocked from going deep because Hoover remains a fixed figure closed to taking a personal journey. Hammer plays Tolson as a bland fashion-plate who enjoys raising an eyebrow and making the occasional suggestive comment; in less constrained circumstances Hammer slyly implies this could have been one fun guy. Watts has little opportunity to express much beyond dogged loyalty and Dench is similarly limited in her portrait of a severe mother hen. A host of actors come and go impersonating with various levels of credibility such famous figures as Charles Lindbergh Emma Goldman Mitchell Palmer Robert Kennedy Bruno Hauptmann Richard Nixon (the only president depicted) and Ginger and Lela Rogers. STORY Leonardo DiCaprio Talks J. Edgar Hoovers Homosexuality; Slashed Fee 90 Percent for Clint Eastwood The various time periods are well represented in James J. Murakamis production design and Deborah Hoppers costumes while cinematographer Tom Stern has elegantly desaturated the visuals in predominantly blue tones. Once again Eastwood has composed his own score but this time out his spare and restrained piano backing feels insufficient to the task at hand as the picture could have been helpfully propelled by a vigorous full-bodied old-school Hollywood score.
