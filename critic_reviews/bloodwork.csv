"Blood Work Another Sample From Clints Lab washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Blood Work Another Sample From Clints Lab Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 9 2002 IF YOU cant figure out who done it in the first half-hour of ""Blood Work"" a meat-and-potatoes thriller directed by and starring Clint Eastwood you need to get out more. The murderer might as well walk around miming stabbing motions with his hand as he makes that eee-EEE eee-EEE sound from ""Psycho."" Youve got to figure that any serial killer who leaves crime scene notes screaming ""catch me"" in blood next to his own encrypted signature - a code thats eventually deciphered by a 10-year-old-boy - is not trying all that hard to stay out of jail. Is it really obvious? Let me put it this way Even Eastwoods character retired FBI profiler Terry McCaleb whos called back into service two months after getting a life-saving heart transplant (courtesy of Dr. Anjelica Huston) figures it out with about 20 minutes to spare. Which leaves him his barely broken-in ticker and his steel-trap mind plenty of time to engage in a tense game of cat-and-mouse with the killer on a rusty half-sunken boat in the middle of some harbor (assuming that is cats and mice had machine guns and FBI-issue firepower A  la ""The Itchy and Scratchy Show""). But I digress. Despite its lack of surprises ""Blood Work"" is actually effective if prosaic entertainment in the way that a piece of New York strip medium well and smothered with A-1 sauce is. You dont order it and then complain that its not Steak Diane. And when youre dining out at Cafe Clint what do you expect? Well ""Dirty Harry""-style justice for one thing. After Terry begins investigating the murder of the woman whose heart now beats in his chest - a murder that appears planned for the express purpose of keeping him in business - it isnt long before hes pulling out his shotgun to blast out the windows of a parked car just because he has a hunch that the guy reading a newspaper behind the wheel is the perp. Okay so hes right but whatever happened to reading him his rights? And because hes Clint even if an older more creased and crustier version with a scary-looking seam up his sternum he still gets the girl. That would be Graciella Rivers (Wanda DeJesus) the sister of the dead woman whose organ donor card is now facilitating McCalebs ability to do the horizontal hokeypokey. Thats right. The scene where Terry takes his shirt off and Graciella runs her fingernails up and down his scar tissue got equal amounts of ""ews"" and laughter at a press screening which actually makes for kind of a funny sound. Be that as it may Eastwoods work in ""Blood Work"" - both behind and in front of the camera - is well workmanlike. The joints of the plot hold together as does the acting (okay the eye squinting). Look its always nice to see Clint and especially nice to see him play someone whose humanity - no whose mortality - is all too apparent. BLOOD WORK (R 110 minutes) - Contains gunplay and execution-style slayings captured on surveillance video implied sexuality obscenity and some sex talk. Area theaters.

The stars last outing 2000s Space Cowboys more than pulled its load. This one coasts at least as much as a movie this slow-moving can. Blood Work (out of four) Stars Clint Eastwood Jeff Daniels Anjelica Huston Wanda De Jesus Tina Lifford Director Clint Eastwood Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for violence and language Opens Friday nationwide Eastwood himself remains pleasing to watch encouraging flab-fighting guys by being so remarkably fit at 72. But because this is a California mystery sleuthed by a Terry (pretty close to Harry) the second-rate nature of this probable fast-fader is evident in every frame. Always among the least vain of superstars Eastwood plays an FBI agent who suffers a coronary during a pursuit gets a new heart two years later and spends the rest of the picture brandishing a huge chest scar that makes an impression every time its bared. Now retired and living on his boat next to an affable goof-off (Jeff Daniels) hes asked by a stranger (Wanda De Jesus) to privately investigate her sisters killing in a convenience store holdup. Turns out in far darker shades of 2000s Return to Me that a mass murderers victim supplied Eastwoods new heart. So when he and De Jesus share a love scene later in the movie the subtext turns weirder and more giggle-inducing than the script can handle. Lets leave this kind of stuff to kinkier vampire pics not another below-average detective movie in which the hero exchanges forced insults with incompetent cops who are intimidated by a masters mastery of a crime scene. Theres some pleasing interplay -- the kind weve seen in a lot of more memorable Eastwood movies -- between the actor and an old-flame colleague (Tina Lifford) and one good testy exchange between Eastwood and a near-victim of the killer. But even saying this much is being charitable. Usually Im as slow as the pacing of a movie in figuring out whos done it. If you cant solve this mystery with an hour to go (as I did) better call for a transfusion so a better type of blood will start flowing to your brain.

Pictures. (HANDOUT PHOTO) CLINT EASTWOOD stars in Malpaso Productions suspense thriller ""Blood Work"" distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. (HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT No rest for weary Eastwood in Blood Work 1 / 1 Back to Gallery BLOOD WORK Crime thriller. Starring Clint Eastwood Jeff Daniels and Wanda De Jesus. Directed by Clint Eastwood. (R. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Blood Work"" is not one of Clint Eastwoods best movies -- its not even one of his better ones. Still the opportunity to see Eastwood in a movie he directed is not to be discounted. He has after all made some excellent ones and even his weaker efforts benefit from an appealing family resemblance to his stronger work. ""Blood Work"" has the three elements weve come to expect from Eastwood the steady pace the shadowy cinematography and of course the presence of the Big Guy. Its a curious thing to savor a movie even as were disappointed by it but ""Blood Work"" inspires that reaction. Watching it its impossible not to be aware that Eastwood is getting up in years and that his thrillers which have been part of the cinematic landscape for three decades cant keep coming forever. Its hard to say whether its affection history or the actual movie that keeps us in our seats but its not as if wed rather be somewhere else. It should be said that ""Blood Work"" makes us look at the 72-year-old Eastwood in terms of mortality not because hes falling apart on us but because of the picture which casts him as a physically compromised man. He plays an old FBI agent named Terry who is felled by a massive heart attack while chasing a serial killer. Two years later he has a new ticker a big scar down the middle of his chest and a battery of pills to take. His doctor (Anjelica Huston) tells him hell be OK if he takes it easy. Wanna bet? Throughout Eastwood does a disconcertingly convincing job of playing a sick man. When he talks at a pay phone he leans against a wall. He gets out of breath midsentence and frequently massages his chest. Eastwoods famous quizzical squint -- and chest-grabbing -- its not a familiar combination. All through the movie people keep telling him to go home and take a nap. He looks like he could use one. Still theres no rest for the weary retired FBI man. No sooner is he home back on his houseboat (all cops live on houseboats -- didnt you know?) than a woman (Wanda De Jesus) shows up asking for his help in solving a convenience- store killing. Her sister the victim was his heart donor. He cant say no. So Eastwood gets to play that character all serious actors end up playing if they live long enough -- the old detective who comes back. Jeff Daniels provides comic relief as the middle-aged slacker who lives on the boat next door and drives the detective around as he investigates the case. For a while as the old pro compiles clues and calls in favors from law- enforcement buddies ""Blood Work"" is an estimable thriller. Its only when the specifics of the crime begin to come into focus about halfway in that the story -- based on the novel by Michael Connelly -- reveals itself as both far- fetched and trite. Even worse the movie concocts a kind of romance between the detective and the victims sister. At the screening I saw the audience erupted into hilarity at the first sign that Eastwood and De Jesus were about to start kissing. Its too silly After presenting us with a man who acts like hes one jog around the block away from keeling over the movie pairs him with a woman about 35 years his junior who looks juicy enough to kill him without even disrobing. . This film contains graphic violence.

"Blood Work | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blood-work ) Blood Work (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Once in seemingly another lifetime the name ""Clint Eastwood"" was synonymous with Spaghetti Westerns and the Man With No Name. In the 70s and 80s he was Dirty Harry the tough cop with a quotable one-liner for seemingly any situation. More recently Eastwood has softened his image and turned into a one-man movie crew often producing directing and starring in his own films. For the most part we have come to expect a fairly high level of quality from Eastwood whether hes an investigative reporter or a space cowboy. Eastwoods latest an adaptation of Michael Connellys Blood Work is a major misstep and a disappointment of significant proportions. It may not be a failure for Eastwood the actor but its a big one for Eastwood the director. Blood Work is one of those crime thrillers where the filmmakers cant see the forest for the trees. Theyre so busy trying to distribute red herrings that they ignore the obvious - any half-thinking member of the audience will have figured out whodunnit early in the proceedings. And once you determine the culprits identity the ""why"" of his actions is easily deduced reducing much of the movie to pointless running around. The cat and mouse game played by the killer and the protagonist isnt interesting. Aside from that its always a bad idea when the audience figures things out long before the characters since it makes them seem irredeemably slow and stupid. The plot is little more than a series of badly knitted contrivances. Even Alfred Hitchcock would have blushed at using some of the elements upon which Blood Work hinges. (For the sake of those who are determined to see the movie I will not reveal any specifics here.) Not having read the novel I cant say whether the fault lies with Connelly or screenwriter Brian Helgeland but this is one of the most insultingly lazy and poorly constructed mystery/thrillers to have come along this year. One simple example when the camera inexplicably lingers on an ""I gave blood"" sticker you know its going to have great relevance later on. The key in a situation is to get the information to the audience without being so obvious about it. There isnt a subtle moment in all of Blood Work. Eastwood plays grizzled FBI profiler Terrell McCaleb a man who is loved by the media but disliked by some of his colleagues. One night while at a crime scene cataloguing the latest atrocity committed by a serial killer McCaleb sees someone in the small crowd of onlookers who might be the murderer. A foot chase ensues with McCaleb nearly catching the suspect before collapsing with a heart attack. Two years later McCaleb has obtained a much-needed heart transplant and is getting back to the business of living when a mysterious beautiful woman named Graciela Rivers (Wanda De Jesus) shows up on his houseboat. According to her McCalebs new heart once belonged to her murdered sister. She wants the ex-FBI agent to use his police contacts to investigate the murder. Although initially reluctant McCaleb eventually relents against the advice of his doctor (Anjelica Huston). Because he needs help McCaleb recruits his slacker neighbor Buddy Noone (Jeff Daniels) to be his driver and gofer. Blood Work may not be well done but it is well cast. Eastwood plays off his Dirty Harry image giving us a version of what Harry might be like at an older age with a heart condition. McCaleb isnt a stretch for Eastwood and it doesnt require much more from him than keeping a straight face when saying lines like ""An accident is fate; murder is evil"" and occasionally touching his chest as if to make sure that his (new) heart is still beating. Wanda De Jesus makes for an attractive and intriguing sidekick although there were more than a few giggles in the audience during a scene when Graciela and McCaleb displayed some intimacy. Theres only about a 30 year age difference. Meanwhile Jeff Daniels does what he does best and plays an affable-but-aimless everyman. Aside from the clumsy screenplay and even clumsier direction there are some other annoyances associated with Blood Work. One of the most egregious is the tendency characters have to utter irritating and inappropriate wisecracks. The biggest offender is Paul Rodriguezs police officer but hes not the only one (late in the movie Jeff Daniels gets into the act). Presumably the intent is for these exchanges to add a little comic relief but even a bad standup comedian would stay away from this material. And aside from a few isolated moments when Eastwood manages to generate a little tension (such as during the early foot chase and in a confrontation with a burly Russian) Blood Work often feels like its dragging. Its not clear to me why Eastwood chose such an unpromising project. Hopefully with his next film hell be back in form. Blood Work will seem hopelessly corny and poorly plotted to all but those who wallow in the badness of half-baked crime thrillers.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Yet Aniston has played working-class heroines before and rather well. As a put-upon young wife in Edward Burns Shes the One she showed a sturdy forthright incorruptibility that lit up an otherwise slight movie. Brad and her size-4 body notwithstanding Anistons glamour isnt sexual -- shes a Breck girl who can slip into ordinariness without the self-importance so many pretty actresses wheel out for the down-home ""plucky"" roles that boost their resumes. Its impossible not to like Aniston and equally impossible not to wish her likability would show a little wear and tear. Which makes it especially gratifying to see her play a woman whos had it up to here with making nice and making do. In director Miguel Artetas new film The Good Girl (his second collaboration with the madly talented screenwriter Mike White) Aniston plays Justine Last a bored resident of Wasteland Texas whose world is bounded by her work as a sales assistant at the Retail Rodeo the discount department store in which most of the action takes place and a becalmed home life with her amiably potheaded husband Phil (John C. Reilly) and his equally doped-up tagalong pal Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson). Phils idea of conjugal adventure is a wild night out at Senor Tuna and you can feel the depression in Justines vacant button eyes in the streaked blond hair carelessly scraped back from her guileless moon face in her timid shuffle in the sudden bursts of irritation at her husband for not getting the television repaired. Shes drowning to the point that shes lost even the power to imagine another life. When a sullen new employee (Jake Gyllenhaal who appears to be spending the year playing boy-toy to desperate older women) introduces himself as Holden a writer of stories that end with their characters taking bug poison Justine whos never heard of J.D. Salinger sees glamour where others would see a cliche. In short order the two are humping away in a cheap motel that Justine doesnt even notice is of a piece with the world she thinks shes fled. So far from escaping to a better life Justine spends her time trying to put out the fires shes ignited and the movies most satisfying -- and disturbing -- joke is that the deeper in she gets the more she discovers in herself a heedless narcissist. Loudly lamenting that she wasnt a good friend to a recently deceased colleague Justine absently leans over and pops some food from her husbands plate into her mouth. As in the work of Carver Bobbie Ann Mason and other chroniclers of the decline of hinterland America The Good Girls terrain is the desolate claustrophobia of physical and emotional decay in small towns bled of all particularity and charm by tawdry monster malls. The production design is a uniform distressed blue like some cheap knockoff of a grungy television ad aimed at teens and the movies first half is cocooned in creepy stillness. People sit stand or lie -- when they move it comes as a shock. Indeed Aniston plays her depressed character with enough conviction to guarantee that practically every scene will be stolen out from under her by minor characters among them a pricelessly funny Zooey Deschanel as a Retail Rodeo employee who vents her rage and frustration on the customers and by screenwriter White reprising the blitzed fishy stare he perfected in Chuck amp; Buck as a security guard who tries to turn Justine on to God. The Good Girl cant help but be a comedy. If it werent wed all be down in the dumps with Justine for which of us mall-ified or not hasnt felt our lives being slowly strangled by mindless routine? As in Arteta and Whites previous movie Chuck amp; Buck every comic situation in The Good Girl contains a kernel of desperation or menace or both. The movie is hardly a morality play -- her creators like Justine too much to send her the way of Anna Karenina or Emma Bovary -- but its message is bleak enough No matter how you slice it lifes a prison. Have a nice day. Eastwood and Huston in Blood Work(Photo by Merie W. Wallace) AT 72 YEARS OLD CLINT EASTWOOD IS OFFICIAL movie royalty and this is not all good. For one thing just about everything he does is received with kid-gloved reverence -- even alas by critics. For another Eastwood has been a subtle crafter of his late-life image which most of us have swallowed wholesale including the guff. Since he turned to directing Eastwood has made some very good films among them The Outlaw Josey Wales A Perfect World Bird and White Hunter Black Heart one great snore (Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil) a tasteful rendition of a dumb novel (The Bridges of Madison County) an insufferably pompous piece of cant (Absolute Power) a fun romp (Space Cowboys) and one justly celebrated great movie Unforgiven. In a good many of the movies he also stars in Eastwood has sought by upstaging the Gary Cooper rectitude of his salad days to persuade us that hes at peace with being a codger and/or a fine old gent. This could be interesting and even wise about what lies beneath Americas obsession with the strong silent type. But vanity will out as evidenced by the magnanimously bosomed youngish women who struck dumb by Eastwoods old-school charm and sexual prowess still populate his movies and most spectacularly by the final scene of Unforgiven an orgasmic shoot-em-up that announced in no uncertain terms ""Im still the Man.""

In his new movie Blood Work Eastwood plays veteran FBI profiler Terry McCaleb surely the only man in the world who can fire off lethal rounds of ammunition while suffering a heart attack massive enough to require a transplant. Call me allergic to men in authority but words cant describe my gratification on seeing Eastwood bossed around by Anjelica Huston who plays Terrys cardiologist and prescribes quiet retirement on a decrepit old houseboat. This of course is not to be. It turns out that Terrys new heart was previously owned by a beautiful young Latina who was murdered under mysterious circumstances and whose equally gorgeous sister Graciella (Wanda de Jesus) shows up to point her impressive breasts at Terry and implore him to crack the case for the sake of her sisters small son. Gentlemanly courtesy those breasts and a suspicion that the murder closely resembles another apparently unconnected one that Terry has been following up compel the aging agent to get back on the job. Against the impolitely expressed wishes of the obligatory dumb police detective (Paul Rodriguez) and with the dubious aid of his indolent trust-funder of a neighbor (a wonderful Jeff Daniels) plus a luscious black former police colleague (Tina Lifford) who bats her eyes at Eastwood while blithely risking her job to provide him with background data Terry returns to work as only a veteran grandstander can -- as a freelancer. One hopes that Michael Connellys novel on which Blood Work is based did a better job of concealing its tracks. Under most circumstances I am utterly hopeless at guessing whodunit but even I had the killer figured out within the hour. Almost nothing comes as a surprise in this stately old fogy of a movie. The pacing is glacial the screenplay (by Brian Helgeland) is stiff as a board and things heat up only in the movies final scenes where notwithstanding his creaking joints and unhappy ticker Terry does what a mans gotta do. But not before the lovely Graciella has shown him in the nicest possible way that shes no ageist and that hes still the Man.

Posted August 7 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT More than ever Clint Eastwoods acting is all squint rasp sinew and bone but damned if he doesnt have a few tricks left in him. Blood Work in which hes cast as a retired FBI agent who goes back on the beat with no legal authority to face down a serial killer is a sturdy if dawdling old-fashioned adding-up-the-clues mystery that turns out to be one or two notches cleverer than you expect; its tasty and diverting genre popcorn. Eastwoods retired enforcer gets back in the game as a solo investigator despite the fact that hes recently received a heart transplant. (His cardiologist played with whip-tongued feistiness by Anjelica Huston keeps chewing him out.) The medical gimmick supplies him with motivation - the ticker hes carrying around in his chest turns out to have a connection to the killer - but the canniest aspect of ""Blood Work"" is the way that it makes the issue of Eastwoods age (hes 72) genuinely dramatic. Its not just that like John Wayne in ""McQ"" he has given himself an excuse for cutting down on the action scenes. Hes now playing a man whose will is stronger than his body and its that tension - between anger and frailty steel and decay - that powers the movie. We see the killer in his ski mask on surveillance videotapes taken at a convenience store and at an ATM. He also leaves clues for Clint in the form of Manson-style blood-scrawled messages. The villains in Eastwood thrillers always seem to be obsessed with him but then so is everyone else in ""Blood Work"" from the cops and cronies he has to manipulate for information to the goofy loser on the neighboring fishing boat played by a floppy-haired lank-grinned Jeff Daniels who springs a few wily image-retooling tricks of his own.

""Blood Work"" is a late-1940s Warner Bros. murder melodrama updated with a heart transplant. Clint Eastwood returns to the crime beat one more time with rudimentary potboiler material that enables him to further his ongoing screen inquiry into the hardships as well as the humor of the aging process for an iconic action hero. The 72-year-old star who is centerscreen throughout makes this rather far-fetched yarn go down much more easily than it otherwise might have but talky affair cant expect a much better B.O. fate than his last effort in this genre ""True Crime."" In nearly every film hes made at least since ""In the Line of Fire"" Eastwood far from ignoring his own advancing years a la Woody Allen has incorporated some sort of commentary on getting old into his characterization. Enjoying the obvious benefit of being in excellent shape Eastwood continues to be able to function credibly in genre formats with only slight modifications to accommodate his characters encroaching maturity. Increasingly the approach has best succeeded with a generous serving of self-deprecating comedy as in his last picture ""Space Cowboys"" in sheer dollars Eastwoods biggest grosser ever. In ""Blood Work"" the premise hinges upon the events of the opening scene in which vet Southern California FBI agent Terry McCaleb (Eastwood) chases a murder suspect for blocks through dark city streets until he collapses with a heart seizure from the exertion. Two years and a transplant later the retired Terry is hewing obediently to the health edicts of his cardiologist (Anjelica Huston) and living quietly on his boat in the Long Beach marina. Thinking hes through with law enforcement hes shortly pulled back in when a purposeful Latina Graciela Rivers (Wanda De Jesus) turns up to inform him that hes alive today only because of her sister Gloria a murder victim whose heart went to Terry. Given additional motivation by his liking for Glorias angelic 10-year-old son Raymond (Mason Lucero) whom Graciela now looks after Terry hits the pavement once again to put his legendary profiling skills to the test in the unsolved case. At every turn he runs into resistance The local cops (Paul Rodriguez Dylan Walsh) dont want to help the big shot for fear hell show them up former FBI colleague Jaye Winston (a nicely understated Tina Lifford) slips him confidential info due to fond romantic memories and his doctor throws him out when he blatantly disregards her warnings. Terrys only concession to his physical limitations is agreeing not to drive or ride in a car with a passenger-side airbag which leads him to recruit his boat bum and all-purpose doofus neighbor Buddy Noone (Jeff Daniels) to chauffeur him around SoCal in his gas-guzzling heap. Terry has little to go on other than minimally revelatory surveillance videos of Glorias murder as well as that of an ATM customer he believes was killed by the same person. The wily old agent mistakenly fingers one imagined perpetrator before an unlikely combination of deductions involving rare blood types organ donations minor physical clues and nutty personal motives enables Terry to identify the culprit paving the way for a nocturnal showdown aboard a rusty fishing trawler. While rattling off pages of dialogue from Brian Helgelands verbose screenplay based on Michael Connellys 1998 novel Eastwood incorporates welcome levity and low-key sexuality into his characterization. The excitement of being back in the hunt literally raises Terrys temperature and he is prone to frequent touching of his chest as he ponders the reality and the import of having received the gift of continued life from a woman he now knows all about. In addition to the evident attraction between Terry and Jaye an amorous fire slowly ignites between Terry and Graciela stemming from their shared intimate link to Gloria their determination to learn why she died and by whose hand. Stylistically ""Blood Work"" is straightforward its dedication to narrative however improbable and character above trendy flourishes and mannerisms pleasingly reminiscent of the cinema of decades past. Lensing by first-time cinematographer Tom Stern who has worked as chief lighting technician on Eastwoods films for a decade and as gaffer for eight years before that is notably crisp as is Joel Coxs editing; running time is tight for an Eastwood film. Lennie Niehaus score is unobtrusively supportive when required attractively jazzy when given some breathing room. Blood WorkProductionA Warner Bros. release of a Malpaso production.
