Entertainment 5 Reasons ""The Last Witch Hunter"" Is The Most Vin Diesel Movie Ever Heres a breakdown of the Fast amp; Furious stars latest Vinity project. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Scott Garfield / Summit ID 7182027 Some actors whove been part of long-running franchises long to break out and do something different -- indies romantic comedies personal films. Not Vin Diesel. When Diesel isnt jumping cars through skyscrapers he just wants to fight mud demons on an alien planet and ride elephants over the Pyrenees. Diesels passion projects aim to be even more grandiose than the Fast amp; Furious series that secured his status as a household name. His latest The Last Witch Hunter is as untrammeled a combination of fantasy geeking-out and ego-driven muscle movie as youll find in theaters this year. It is terrible. It is fabulously entertaining. It is the most Vin Diesel project of all time. And heres why ID 7180564 1. It starts off with Vin Diesel as a Viking named Kaulder. View this image > Scott Garfield / Summit ID 7180693 Theoretically the film begins in the Middle Ages since by the time it skips to the present day Diesels characters Kaulder has been in the witch-hunting biz for 800 years. But his look in the beginning is pure Viking or more accurately like Diesel watched Vikings on the History Channel and decided he wanted in on that sweet undercut action. Is there something fundamentally funny about the sight of the perpetually bald Diesel with hair? Of course -- it was the best unspoken joke in Sidney Lumets underappreciated Find Me Guilty. And yet Diesel wears the flowing locks and beard pigtails with such evident enjoyment as he and his pals in the vague past trek to a witch tree and down into a witch hole to fight the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) as if trying to make a point that his macho star wattage cant be dimmed by the covering up of his shiny pate. ID 7182015 2. Kaulder is a character with no flaws. View this image > Richard Foreman / Summit ID 7181960 Present-day Kaulder is the manliest man to have ever lived forever in an extremely lavish apartment overlooking Central Park and fight using a flaming sword. Yes Dom in the Fast amp; Furious seems like a character whos indestructible and never wrong but he has nothing on Kaulder. Kaulder has infinite money tasteful designer clothes and a closet full of magical items. He works for some organization within the Catholic Church called the Axe and the Cross mostly so that they can refer to him in whispers as ""the Weapon"" and assign him a Buffy-style handler called a Dolan who keeps a history of all of his badass adventures (Michael Caine then Elijah Wood). Hes ""cursed"" with immortality his wounds healing as soon as theyre inflicted so hes by his own admission never afraid. He is a cheat code incarnate hilariously indulgent and his hobby is fixing watches as if the whole man-out-of-time thing needed a visual metaphor to really hammer it home. His weaknesses include preferring to work alone and getting a little lonely between picking up flight attendants which are so barely weaknesses that the movie has to invent a grand betrayal to allow for any conflict. ID 7182016 3. Kaulder witchhuntersplains magic to witches. View this image > Scott Garfield / Summit ID 7181981 In the past Kaulder killed witches (a gender-neutral term in the world of the movie) but in the present theres a treaty and hes more of a witch cop able to embody fantasy and cop cliches in the best urban utopian fashion. Kaulders not a witch but that doesnt stop him from knowing more about them than any actual witch does -- he even explains their history to his reluctant ally Chloe (Rose Leslie). Kaulders job is to make sure none of the witches living among us misbehave sending bad witches to the witch prison and sometimes benevolently saving ones who just dont know better from themselves. The first time we see Kaulder in action hes tracking down a young witch on a flight whos stored some elemental runes too close together causing the storm that threatens to bring down the plane. Witches Kaulder witchhuntersplains dont know their own power. But clearly Diesel does. ID 7182040 4. The movie is Dungeons amp; Dragons-inspired. View this image > Scott Garfield / Summit ID 7182065 Diesel has spoken often about his love of Dungeons amp; Dragons and the movie was actually born out of a discussion about Damp;D he had with Cory Goodman who went on to write the screenplay with Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless with Saharas Breck Eisner later brought on to direct. The Last Witch Hunter is set in a world full of rules Kaulder smugly explains -- like those runes on the plane or the difference between elemental magic which is neutral and black magic which is not. He refers to someone as a ""level 14 warlock"" disrupts a concealment spell and at one point goes to buy a memory potion. The movie as a whole feels like a way of smuggling RPG logic into the multiplex. ID 7182096 5. The fate of the world is less important than the possibility of a sequel. View this image > Scott Garfield / Summit ID 7182106 Diesel loves his franchises -- he fought to make the third Riddick film happen even when most of the rest of the world seemed pretty ready to let that character go. And The Last Witch Hunter ends on a particularly ridiculous ""this will be a series dammit"" note. (Mild spoilers ahead.) The movies overall arc involves a revelation about Kaulders curse and a conspiracy to bring the Witch Queen back. The whole thing would in anyone elses hands set up Kaulder getting to live life as a mortal to age and to die except that wouldnt allow Diesel to continue playing the character as superhuman were the film to get the sequel the actor claims is already in the works. So instead theres a moment in which Chloe literally begs Kaulder to keep going pleading ""The world needs you I need you"" as he makes a choice that renders a lot of the drama that came before pointless. Kaulders existence may place the world in continual danger but what does that matter when theres the possibility of more Witch Hunter movies?

"The Last Witch Hunter review So bad that you root for the coven - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Last Witch Hunter review So bad that youll root for the coven The Last Witch Hunter Scott Garfield/Lionsgate / TNS Vin Diesel stars as Kaulder who has been cursed to an eternity of hunting down witches. Vin Diesel stars as Kaulder who has been cursed to an eternity of hunting down witches. (Scott Garfield/Lionsgate / TNS) Katie WalshChicago Tribune Maggot cupcakes magic butterfiles and a gummy bear tree cant save this movie from itself. What to make of ""The Last Witch Hunter""? What a curious conundrum. Its too self-reflective to be an entertaining mess of unintentional hilarity but none of the actual scripted punchlines land. The premise itself while definitely out there could possibly work if the nonsensical screenplay didnt throw everything at it to see what sticks. There are moments where it achieves the highest camp and times where it strives for something attempting dark grittiness and that middle ground is a brutal no-mans-land. Like that other witch hunter movie ""Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters"" this is a film that is completely looney tunes and it only half knows it.Lets dissect. Star Vin Diesel pushes the powers of his racial ambiguity to the max in a prologue that outlines the origin story of his witch hunter character. About 800 or so years ago Kaulder (Diesel) tromps around a forest in his best Euro-tribal drag complete with inexplicable gingery beard and a fierce weave. He corners the Witch Queen whos made up of tree roots and bees; she has brought a ""black plague"" upon humanity. He skewers her with his fire sword but not before she curses him to live forever hunting witches. Fast forward to present day and Kaulder has adopted the cue ball hairdo that is Diesels trademark. Hes been at this witch hunting game for a while which means he has powers to deduce the presence of witches by fogging up windows with his breath and whispering ""magic"" He can also control the weather by fiddling around with ""ancient runes."" Hes got a sick ride and an entire order of priests dedicated to basically being his personal assistants. Sir Michael Caine is his favorite priest assistant and best friend.Sir Michael Caine dies and is replaced by Elijah Wood. Kaulder suspects black magic and with some of his witchy forensic skills the plot is off and running. Here is a list of things that appear in this movie after this point maggot cupcakes magical butterflies a gummi bear tree a witch council where a wizard informs them they look like a terrible 80s band (they do) Elijah Wood wearing a white stretch turtleneck a botanical witch fashion show a maraschino cherry filled with memory potion mixed up by Rose Leslie a blind pastry chef eaten by a tree and a witch queen whose main super power is controlling a swarm of bees. Absolutely no effort is put into explaining why these witches are so bad. As far as you can tell they are environmentalists who want to turn the urban landscape back into a green space. Apparently the witch queen must be destroyed because shes ugly aggressive and wants to kill Vin Diesel. Other than that it seems that she just wants to do some undisturbed gardening with her crew. Pardon me but Team Witch.At one point Vin Diesel says that by incarcerating all the witches hes hunted theyve created the perfect coven. This is the moment when you realize that the film should have been called ""The Worst Witch Hunter."" He might be the last witch hunter but hes definitely not the best. Sounds like the movie. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.

"Last Witch Hunter The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; last-witch-hunter-the ) Last Witch Hunter The (United States 2015) October 25 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli If Vin Diesel is looking for a third franchise to add to his resume The Last Witch Hunter might be considered a ""safe"" option. His character Kaulder an 800+ year old warrior for the forces of good doesnt require Diesel to step out of his comfort zone. Hes Dom Torreto without the car Riddick without the stare. Unfortunately a film needs more than Diesels Stallone-ish appeal to succeed and thats where The Last Witch Hunter is found lacking. Elements of the narrative are beyond confusing and director Breck Eisners spastic ""style"" of staging action scenes forces the viewer to wait until the fight is over to figure out who won. There are hints that at some point during its genesis The Last Witch Hunter involved a more ambitious story than the one assembled in this 106-minute feature but if a better version existed it didnt make it to theaters. The movie starts out with a visually arresting but largely incoherent sequence in which a bunch of men looking like Lord of the Rings refugees enter the lair of the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) with the goal of putting an end to her reign and the pestilence associated with it. Most of what happens inside is a blur but one knight - the aforementioned Kaulder - makes it out alive. As he kills the Witch Queen however she curses him with immortality. Bummer. The next time we meet him hes wandering around the modern world doing what hes been doing for the past eight centuries - kicking evil witch butt.  His sidekick Dolan the 36th (Michael Caine) is getting a little long in the tooth. Opting for retirement he introduces Kaulder to his replacement Dolan the 37th (Elijah Wood) then promptly kicks the bucket. Kaulder thinking it unlikely that his friend would retire and die on the same day investigates and discovers a dark conspiracy engineered by a coven intent on resurrecting the Witch Queen. With the aid of an attractive good witch dream walker Chloe (Game of Thrones Rose Leslie) Kaulder tries to remember a key memory he has forgotten then gets involved in another action sequence where we have trouble figuring out whats happening. As trashy fantasy movies go at least this one isnt boring. Its loud and raucous and Diesel and Leslie seem to be invested in their characters.  The same cant be said of Michael Caine although its tough commenting about his acting since it mostly involves him lying on his back in a coma. Elijah Wood is so forgettable that the only reason we remember hes has a part in The Last Witch Hunter is because of a late-innings ""twist."" The less said about that plot point the better - it serves little purpose beyond dragging out the running length by ten minutes and transforming a clean ending into a sloppy one. I mentioned earlier that there are flashes of a better movie embedded herein. Kaulders immortality is treated as a more of a curse than a blessing and we can see how the passage of time has weighed on him. Hes cocky arrogant and afraid of getting close to anyone. The Witch Queens end game could be considered clever although Im not sure it makes much sense. The flashback/dream sequences are effective in humanizing Kaulder although his pain doesnt come across as vividly as the filmmakers hope. The Last Witch Hunter feels like the first episode of a would-be series although unlike some similar endeavors it tells a stand-alone story. It bears a passing resemblance to another 2015 title Seventh Son (although that film stayed entirely in a Dungeons amp; Dragons era while this one only starts there) but isnt quite as engaging. The film lacks the quality one expects from a late October/Oscar Season release feeling instead more like a worthy contender for January/February distribution. Regardless of the date of its unveiling however no amount of witchcraft will be able to attract a large enough audience for this to achieve a better box office reception than the tepid one it deserves.

"The Last Witch Hunter plagued by bad script worse CGI review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Last Witch Hunter plagued by bad script worse CGI reviewEven when hes playing an 800-year-old immortal she-devil slayer the essential Vin Diesel manages to seep through.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 23 2015The Last Witch HunterStarring Vin Diesel Michael Caine Elijah Wood Rose Leslie and Julie Engelbrecht. Directed by Breck Eisner. 106 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. 14AYou can take the man out of the car but you cant take the gas out of Vin Diesel.The essential Diesel seeps through even when hes playing an 800-year-old immortal she-devil slayer in the regrettable occult thriller The Last Witch Hunterwhere hetwirls a fiery sword rather than a steering wheel. Article Continued BelowThis is no mean feat considering The Last WitchHunter is so drenched in CGI effects it looks as if its been dunked in a vat of lacquer. Vin Diesel is as incommunicative as always and fatally lacking in humour.  (Scott Garfield / eOne)  The visual murk along with Breck Eisners dismal direction and an impenetrable script overwhelm two serious thespians in the cast Michael Caine and Elijah Wood. Theyre reduced to cardboard versions of the same dull character a Roman Catholic clerical advisor named Dolan who somehow assists Diesels witch-hunting Kaulder.Things get off to a rollicking start opening in medieval times as Kaulder leads a band of European stalwarts determined to roast the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht). She has unleashed the Black Death upon the world a fact historians and epidemiologists seem to have overlooked. With his Fort Apache rug and shaggy beard Diesel is a double for one of Tom Hardys gnarlier characters as he dispatches the evil crone -- but not before she vengefully confers the curse of immortality upon him. Jump to 21st-century New York and Diesel is back to the bullet-headed bouncer look of popular renown still as incommunicative as always and fatally lacking in humour. The immortality curse and hag-hunting mandate remain as does the witchs determination to fatally infect the planet. Kaulder joins forces with a witchy turncoat the feisty Chloe (Game of Thrones Rose Leslie) and the quest is on. Kaulder admits to Chloe that he gets tired of smiting witches and their stooges (""Its boring"") and on this we can heartily agree with the big lug.Pity though that nothing is made of his reference to ""witch prison"" some kind of corral for cacklers awaiting his sword. I picture Vin Diesel leading a posse of foxy women in a rousing version of ""Jailhouse Rock"" and that I would gladly pay money to see.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Witch Please Vin Diesels The Last Witch Hunter Is Both Supremely Nerdy and Not Nerdy Enough << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Witch Please Vin Diesels The Last Witch Hunter Is Both Supremely Nerdy and Not Nerdy Enough Lionsgate Movies October 23 2015 by Alex Pappademas Facebook Twitter Print In 2002s xXx Vin Diesels extreme athlete turned superspy alter ego Xander Cage had the word MELKOR tattooed across his lower abdomen. Melkor was the name of a Lucifer-like fallen-angel figure in J.R.R. Tolkiens The Silmarillion; it was also the name that Diesel gave his all-time favorite Dungeons amp; Dragons player-character a dark elf who specialized in -- wait for it -- hunting witches. Diesel may still be built like the nightclub bouncer he once was but deep down in the androids dungeon of his heart hes a huge nerd with a nerds passion for encyclopedically detailed fictional universes. His Vinnermost desires came through the clearest in 2004s The Chronicles of Riddick a dumb but deeply felt attempt to expand the Pitch Black universe into a Star Wars or Lord of the Rings-style mega-mythology involving an interstellar death cult called the Necromongers and their quest for an interdimensional Valhalla called the Underverse. Nobody liked it and 2013s back-to-badass-basics sequel Riddick dialed the world-building way down but its clear that Diesel still wants a sprawling multi-film fantasy franchise to call his own and that voicing a tree with a three-word vocabulary in endless Guardians of the Galaxy sequels isnt going to scratch that itch. Hence The Last Witch Hunter a feature film that feels like a longish TV pilot or like the prequel to the Witch Hunter sequel that Diesel told his Facebook fans the studio was ""already commencing"" back in June. (They might as well have called this one The Last Witch Hunter 1.) Breck Eisner of the California Eisners directs; Diesel stars as Kaulder seen here first as a 13th-century warrior with a braided Battlefield Earth beard and a Macklemore Mohawk leading his fellow Knights of the Axe and Cross through a snowy wasteland to put the hurt on a witch they blame for the Black Plague. The Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) has a Gigeresque ponytail of spinal-column bones and lives in a tree that pulses with malevolent life. Kaulder sets his sword magickally afire and runs her through but before she dies she curses him with immortality. Eight hundred years later Kaulder has become one of those true New Yorkers who takes pride in knowing what everything used to be except in this case he remembers when the Duane Reade on the corner was a patch of cornfield. Lionsgate Kaulder has a cool car and a wardrobe of exclusively open-necked shirts and has sex with stewardesses in an austere-yet-groovy bachelor pad -- the walls are marble; its like he lives in a bank -- near St. Patricks Cathedral with a pool table and a secret closet full of witch-killing guns. Hes a little bit John Constantine and a lot bit Bruce Wayne and his Alfred is -- well its Michael Caine playing Alfred again basically although in the script hes Dolan the 36th in a long line of priests sworn to service as Kaulders witch-hunting sidekick. Theyve been together long enough that Kaulder addresses him as kid; when they meet to toast Dolans retirement Kaulder says ""We took out some nasty covens."" When Dolan turns up dead and Kaulder finds SURRENDER DOROTHY-ish witch graffiti burned into the walls of his room things get yknow personal. How much more do you really need to know before deciding if this is a broomstick you want to hop on to? Its Vin Diesel as a supernatural cop with an inexperienced audience-surrogate-question-asking partner (Elijah Wood). He shakes down witches and warlocks for answers regarding Dolans death and discovers a conspiracy to resurrect the Witch Queen. He finds an unlikely ally in Chloe (Rose Leslie Game of Throness Ygritte) a witch whos the proprietor of a magic-potion speakeasy and has the (narratively convenient) power to project herself into Kaulders past-life flashbacks and yank him back to reality. Sometimes he mansplains witch history to Chloe so we can learn it too. Sometimes he says things like ""Salem was a mistake -- those women were innocent"" as if daring us to laugh. This is as close as the movie comes to acknowledging that actual witch-hunting was a form of violent church-sanctioned misogyny; I concede that complaining about this is like complaining that Furious 7 was insufficiently worried about peak oil. You get the feeling that binders full of backstory were generated as this script took shape and that Diesel dreams of squeezing that material for all the sequels and prequels and graphic novels and video games its worth until every minute of Kaulders 800-year career is accounted for from his first cigarette to his last shrieking-crone impalement. But the actual movie in front of us feels thin; it arranges borrowed ideas into a legitimately interesting world and then skates across its surface. I liked (and would have liked more of) the movies vision of a modern Manhattan where witches live as a secret sybarite subculture among unsuspecting humans like the beatnik sorcerers from Bell Book and Candle (1958 directed by Richard Quine with Kim Novak casting a love spell on Jimmy Stewart the same year as Vertigo; go watch it its great). But thats me; Im the type of person who thought an extra 30 minutes of explication regarding the assassin hotel would have improved John Wick. Bell Book and Candle meets John Wick is a version of this story I could have really gotten behind. The Last Witch Hunter still represents an opportunity to enjoy Diesel being Diesel -- the borderline-camp solemnity he brings to even the sandbaggiest line of dialogue is a trash-redeeming force as powerful as the Rocks arched eyebrow. Its still trash though. Filed Under Movies Movie reviews The Last Witch Hunter Vin Diesel Breck Eisner Alex Pappademas is a staff writer for Grantland.

Photo Lionsgate The Last Witch Hunter is so dense so packed with stuff -- with spells and strange beings and dreams and weapons and ornate walls and tree roots tangled with skulls and giant swirling apocalyptic black clouds of man-eating flies -- that you might not notice at first that there arent any people in it. Vin Diesel plays Kaulder a beefy bearded warrior we first meet sometime in the Middle Ages as he kills the ghastly Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht). Witches you see are real and they were responsible for the Black Death and Kaulder and others have been hunting them for some time in an effort to avenge their loved ones. Right before she turns into a pillar of ash the Witch Queen puts the curse of immortality on our hero. ""I curse you with life To never know peace To walk the earth for all eternity"" So he was maybe an average Joe witch hunter once but now hes an immortal. The film then flashes forward to many centuries later and Kaulder still alive after all these years now shorn of his beard and looking for all the world like Vin Diesel is on an airplane hitting a strange bit of turbulence. He sniffs out a young witch on the plane but he lets her go with a warning. (Then he seduces a stewardess but I digress.) We learn that witches are now allowed to govern themselves so long as they dont hurt people and that Kaulder has been policing them all these hundreds of years. His only companions are a long line of priests all called Dolan. The 36th Dolan played by Michael Caine in full-on Alfred Pennyworth mode (""Youre missing a great part of your life. The part where you share it"") is preparing to retire and the job of guiding and redeeming Kaulder will fall to a young novice played by Elijah Wood. While the world Kaulder inhabits is supposedly our own the figures he comes across are all variations on fantastical beings all in on the game to some degree. The priests are mortal sure but theyre also centuries-old companions and keepers of dark secrets. Kaulder soon matches up with Chloe (Rose Leslie) a shape-shifter (thats a kind of witch apparently) who runs a Memory Bar and can enter peoples dreams. Theres also Belial (Olafur Darri Olafsson) an evil witch who longs for the days of the Witch Queen before the uneasy truce. And Ellic (Joe Gilgun) another shape-shifter who lures young kids to their doom. And a blind merchant played by the seemingly always-underused Isaach De Bankole. Nobody knows everything but everybody knows something; theyre all role-players. Thats probably the idea Diesel an avid Dungeons amp; Dragons fan previously expressed his desire to create a movie that fits into that kind of experience -- where everyone has powers and understands the game at hand. That unfortunately doesnt leave much room for us.A Theres no one here to show some wonder or curiosity as a way of bringing us into this story. Chloe presumably plays the role of ingenue but even shes basically a powerful witch and Leslie gives her an opaque calmness; the young Dolan meanwhile doesnt get much to do (save for some business at the end which I wont spoil). Theres enough production design onscreen to suggest thatA The Last Witch Hunters universe has been deeply imagined by somebody somewhere but it doesnt translate in any dramatically interesting way. We keep finding out about new beings and new sub-beings and new powers and new spells but without a compelling drama to attach themselves to the revelations feel inconsequential. Watching The Last Witch Hunter is like sitting by while someone else plays a game whose coolness eludes us.

Manori Ravindran Contributed to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 23 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 23 2015 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Breck Eisner Written by Cory Goodman Matt Sazama Burk Sharpless Starring Vin Diesel Elijah Wood Rose Leslie Country USA Language English This fall never mind the spectres of James Bond Its the season of the witch hunter. More specifically The Last Witch Hunter - though Vin Diesels V-necked immortal hero likely isnt going anywhere any time soon. Directed by Breck Eisner this fantasy action film spends so much time setting itself up as a potential franchise its incredible that Diesels Kaulder finds any time to change formidable-looking peacoats let alone save mankind from a witch queens 800-year-old grudge. The script comes from Priest screenwriter Cory Goodman who penned The Last Witch Hunter with Diesel in mind due to the pairs affinity for the game Dungeons amp; Dragons and a witch hunter character used by the actor. Let this morsel of context be your guide in understanding why Diesel despite his familiar wooden delivery is a good fit for this supernatural world that - remarkably - isnt based on a comic book. Its a true witchy original. Sort of.The film does little to set up the Middle Ages of Kaulders youth instead jumping straight into the warriors pursuit of some unfortunate-looking creatures with his witch-slaying squad in tow. The target here is the witch queen who with a reasonable helping of visual effects looks downright menacing but still human making the standoff - and overarching conflict - somewhat relatable. As Kaulder plunges a fiery sword into her shrinking body she curses him with immortality. Annoying.Centuries later the globe-trotting Kaulder is flying ""Abu Dhabi Air"" to present-day New York where he resides and keeps the peace ensuring that Earths surviving witches dont harm humans. And who is there to protect him but Michael Caines priestly Dolan the 36th ""handler and confessor"" to Kaulder who is essentially Alfred to his supernatural Batman (""Weve taken down some nasty covens"" Diesel growls). When Caines Dolan dies on the eve of his retirement Kaulder investigates the death with the mousy Dolan 37 (Elijah Wood) only to find that long-banished dark magic is at play.If all of this sounds well bananas thats because it is. But The Last Witch Hunter is redeemed through complex visual-effects work that aptly illuminates Goodmans netherworld. Further Diesels stolid performance is balanced through the supporting star power of Caine - even with criminally limited scenes - and Rose Leslies ""dream walker"" whose earnestness makes even the world of a macho witch hunter seem entirely plausible.The most significant blow to Eisners film is the constant reminder that it could be continued. Seemingly at every juncture the finality so necessary to up the stakes of this story is quickly snatched away in order to tease a sequel or two leaving you wondering what the point of this supernatural exercise was in the first place.

Vin Diesel stars as Kaulder in ""The Last Witch Hunter."" (Scott Garfield / Lionsgate) Robert Abele ""The Last Witch Hunter"" should really be called ""Another Franchise Hunter"" as its a loud convoluted digitally messy stab at a fourth movie series for Vin Diesel (10 points if you can name them all) and the one most likely to earn that ""Last.""Here hes ancient warrior Kaulder who 800 years ago vanquished the plague-spreading Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) a sinewy slime-caked meanie who terrorizes by manipulating bugs and tree roots. She curses Kaulder with immortality if by the 21st century you call a swank Manhattan pad bedding flight attendants and having Michael Caine as your very own priestly advisor a curse. But the long-standing truce protecting humans from magic is suddenly doomed and Kaulder needs the help of a fetching witch (Rose Leslie from ""Game of Thrones"") and a new advisor (Elijah Wood) to make sense of it all because we sure wont. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;""The Last Witch Hunter"" is one of those artlessly restless exposition-dialogue fantasy-action slogs that thanks to Breck Eisners untamed direction never manages to corral all the potion talk mythology rationale and leaps back and forth in time into anything remotely entertaining (save Diesels twinkly growl-speak).

Credit Scott Garfield/Lionsgate A smorgasbord of empty calories the Vin Diesel vehicle ""The Last Witch Hunter"" for all its overstuffed visuals leaves you hungry. But not for more. Mr. Diesel plays Kaulder who for 800 years has hunted followers of the dreaded Witch Queen who cursed him with immortality around the time he impaled her with a fiery sword back in the medieval day. Now shes reawakening.For millenniums Kaulder has been attended by faithful priests called the Dolans; Michael Caine and Elijah Wood both cashing paychecks here are the 36th and 37th. One witch (Rose Leslie of ""Game of Thrones"" deserving better material) signs on to help Kaulder unaccountably happy to betray her queen. Video Trailer The Last Witch Hunter A preview of the film.

Photo Credit Lionsgate / Scott Garfield advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Inspired by fantasy role-playing games. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE The dependable Diesel and a fine cast keep this hokey action flick mostly entertaining. CAST Vin Diesel Elijah Wood Rose Leslie LENGTH 138 If youre a fan of Dungeons amp; Dragons the fantasy role-playing game that has been synonymous with nerdism since 1974 you may know that the actor Vin Diesel is also a devotee. If anybody could make sword and sorcery seem cool its Diesel and he does his best with ""The Last Witch Hunter"" an action-horror flick that he not only stars in but conceived and helped produce. Inspired by his days as an avid gamer ""The Last Witch Hunter"" stars Diesel as Kaulder a Crusader with a flaming sword. Eight hundred years ago he killed the Witch Queen (a computer-assisted Julie Engelbrecht) a formidable foe despite the unmemorable moniker. With her dying breath she curses Kaulder with immortality and hes been hunting witches ever since. advertisement | advertise on newsday Flash forward to modern-day Manhattan where Kaulder is doing quite nicely. He works for the Axe and Cross a well-funded arm of the Catholic Church which keeps him in fashionable suits and puts him up in what appears to be the top floor of the San Remo. Chloe a young witch -- shes one of the good ones -- wakes up in Kaulders pad one morning and cant help but gasp ""Nice view."" Chloe a hip street-smart witch is the kind of character whose sassiness usually lands with a thud in movies of this sort but Rose Leslie (HBOs ""Game of Thrones"") plays her with intelligence and moxie. Rounded out by Elijah Wood and Michael Caine as Kaulders priestly valets plus a memorable Dawn Olivieri as a hookah-puffing femme fatale the spirited cast keeps this movie entertaining despite its overly familiar feel. (It owes a large debt to 2005s supernatural noir ""Constantine."") The script is overstuffed with supernatural hokum -- covens councils contracts you name it -- and Breck Eisners direction frequently loses coherence. (The opening action sequence remains a bit of a puzzle.) Still Diesel and his colleagues make for good company and the occasional kooky detail can liven things up. Look for Joseph Gilgun as Ellic a nasty warlock whose faded T-shirt clearly bears the words ""Farmingdale Long Island.""

Scott Garfield/Courtesy of Lionsgate Films hide caption toggle caption Scott Garfield/Courtesy of Lionsgate Films Vin Diesel as Kaulder in a scene from The Last Witch Hunter. Scott Garfield/Courtesy of Lionsgate Films There are some cinematic images which if we were unable to appreciate them for their silliness would make us fall into a pit of despair about the state of entertainment. Vin Diesel popping an evil bug out of Michael Caines face like a zit for example. Or an ancient stone door in a sleek Manhattan luxury apartment that can only be opened with what looks like a high school class ring. How about a musclebound beefcake detecting magic by fogging up a window with his breath as though he were a really really serious five-year-old? We must cherish these sights and remember their dumb charms hold them close like jewels lest they slip from our fingers in the geyser of unmemorably dumb stuff in our current day and age. These are just some of the absurdities that await us in the cheeseball funhouse of The Last Witch Hunter the latest Diesel-run action franchise starter. This one is modeled after--what else?--Diesels Dungeons amp; Dragons character. Thankfully the Fast amp; Furious star has an admirable commitment to the preposterous. Some action heroes take themselves too seriously or think theyre making popcorn fun when theyre really filleting us with endless rounds of ammunition. Not Diesel--this is an actor who knows hes at his most entertaining when hes growling something of epic resolve in his rustic man-cave of a voice. Any sort of variation in pitch would ruin the fun. We first meet Diesels Kaulder eight centuries ago storming a remote witch cave in animal skins and a bald-and-bearded facial style that would look pretty good on Andy Samberg. Hes cornering the Witch Queen with his tribe of hunters but just before he slays her the queen curses Kaulder with eternal life--that bug Blake Lively also came down with earlier this year. This leads nicely to present-day New York where witches live in secret and Diesel gets to call a Knight of the British Empire ""kid."" True one of the most respected actors alive should not be in a witch-hunting movie but Michael Caines been in worse and he seems to be enjoying himself so let him be. Besides he doesnt stick around for long as the priest he plays--the latest in a succession of council-appointed holy men to aid Kaulder in his fight against underworld demons--is found dead under mysterious circumstances. Investigating his friends death alongside the mousy replacement priest (Elijah Wood) and an attractive young good-girl witch with the ability to enter dreams (Rose Leslie of Game of Thrones) will lead Kaulder to fights unfinished and more phrases to growl. If things were only a smidge cheerier wed be in Jason and the Argonauts territory and the film does seem like it could use a dose of Ray Harryhausen creature-feature magic. One eerie shot of a charred witchs still-beating heart being lifted out of her corpse by the tip of a sword gives hints as to what might have been with more physical effects and less CGI. The world-building itself helped by three credited screenwriters isnt all that inventive Talk of an ancient truce secret clubs where people get high on spells and magic councils all get lost in the muddle. But director Breck Eisner (The Crazies) undercuts all that nonsense with charmingly incongruous jokes about cell phones cab fare and putting out demon blazes with fire extinguishers. The witch huntin runs out of gas in the homestretch as do the threats of PG-13 eternal damnation. The color palette darkens the action gets blurry and interest in Kaulders trials wanes. This doesnt bode well for the Witch Hunter sequel which (witch?) is already in development. Dumb stuff only remains charming for so long. Of course thats what everyone thought about the early years of the Fast amp; Furious franchise so maybe theres no predicting immortality.

As horror it is laughable. As comedy it is horrible -- except for a couple of silly Vin Diesel moments as he plays the title character. Designed as a possible movie franchise for Dungeons amp; Dragons freaks but likely destined for the box office trash bin The Last Witch Hunter takes place in contemporary times with a prologue set in the mid-1300s. As we see in the prologue and in several dream-nightmare flashbacks the concept is deceptively simple even if the storytelling is unnecessarily convoluted and even garbled. A powerful 14th century witch queen (Julie Engelbrecht in severely unflattering makeup) sends the black plague to wipe out humanity; a vengeful human warrior (Diesel) perishes while trying to kill her for her genocide; she curses him with immortality; then in the 21st century in New York City the queen tries to make a comeback using the witch hunter as a tool for her destructive plans. Witch hunter Diesel of course is annoyed and tries to stop her. Let the murder mayhem and creepy effects set in with swarms of flies from Amityville Horror ready to freak you out. Yet there is not a single scary moment in the movie despite the overwrought efforts of the effects team deployed by genre director Breck Eisner (Sahara The Crazies). Meanwhile the chunky and clunky Diesel cannot effectively deliver most of the funny lines either. So The Last Witch Hunter fails to find the right tone. It is not even bad enough to be good camp comedy. Blame the casting. Eisner did it too well. He has 82-year-old British legend Michael Caine playing the priest who serves as guardian to Diesels witch hunter. Eisner also signed up Scottish star Rose Leslie (Ygritte in Game of Thrones and Gwen Dawson in Downton Abbey) as a good witch who sides with Diesel and enjoys a little sexual frisson with the lug. Elijah Wood fondly remembered as Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings trilogy plays a weirdo priest being trained to replace Caine as the hunters sidekick. The superb African-French actor Isaach de Bankole tackles the thankless role of a blind witch who has a way with butterflies. And Hollywoods resident Icelandic Olafur Darri Olafsson plays the heavy both literally and figuratively. So the movie actually has some bottom even though it would have been better off if every support player was an incompetent boob. That would have made Diesel look good in comparison. Diesel spends his time spouting witch lore and other nonsense while occasionally fighting witches and their demons. He also ""sparks"" with Leslie although their interactions could not light a match much less a romantic fire. There are also what appear to be a couple of Fast amp; Furious in-jokes particularly in Diesels discerning choice in hot wheels and also in a drift driving scene at the end that generates a laugh. But these are small cold comforts in a hostile movie populated by unholy apparitions and a dour moody man who has dared to hunt them for more than 800 years.

Comments click to enlarge The Last Witch Hunter Video Rated PG-13  106 minutes  2015 Vin Diesel stars as an immortal witch hunter in New York City tracking down practitioners of black magic and showing them whos boss. His controlled smirky performance sets the tone for this effects-laden action fantasy which verges on self-parody but never quite takes the plunge. The special effects are pretty neat and the filmmakers utilize them smartly delivering imaginative set pieces that are more visually compelling than the usual series of digital explosions. Among the highlights are some scene-shifting hallucination sequences and a monster made from rotted trees and pieces of human skeletons. Breck Eisner directed; with Michael Caine and Elijah Wood providing some gravitas as priests who assist Diesel.

To hell with them. Vin Diesel may not run smoothly but he runs with purpose and conviction and any line of dialogue processed through him comes out sounding like he believes it even the sentimental ones. And the corny lets-do-this ones the ones that sound like the terse keep-you-reading chapter-endings of airport bestsellers? When Diesel gets one of those the story around him surges like a video-game racecar thats just hit a nitro.That conviction is his great asset outside the mad physical fact of him. Its why seeing his name on an un-pedigreed release like The Last Witch Hunter -- as star and producer -- is reason for hope For all his car movies and xXxes his true heart pumps dragon blood. Diesels as dedicated to Damp;D as he is to his lifting routine and he honors the game and its pulp roots in the first minutes of Witch Hunter. Wearing a dwarven beard and waving a flaming sword he and an armored band of vaguely medieval men descend into a haunted tree to stab a bug-puking fury theyre calling ""The Witch Queen."" The sequence is too quick too chopped up for us really to sink into it to soak up the wicked viny production design or to fear from what burl or hellmouth the next tendril might lash.Film Details The Last Witch Hunter RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time106 min. More Info Trailer Compare that to act one of Riddick another RPG-night channeling of Robert E. Howard stories In it Diesel alone fights and hides from monsters in a cave on another planet until he actually seems to level up and defeat the beast he couldnt at first. Its scary rousing elemental and sincere in its simplicity -- what a disappointment it is when the actual story finally kicks in. Some ambitious young screenwriter should send him 100 plotless pages of dungeon-delving and dragon-bashing as that seems to be the movie hes looking for and hes got the clout to get it made. (Fan theory The Riddick movies are actually the sci-fi RPG led by Toretto and Letty at those Fast amp; Furious family barbecues.)For now we have The Last Witch Hunter a 90 million supernatural time-killer thats mostly set in the here and now rather than in say Gary Gygaxs Greyhawk although Diesel does grumble something about facing a ""fourteenth-level warlock."" Turns out Diesels character -- Kaulder -- got cursed by that witch in that tree and now hes doomed to spend the rest of eternity walking the Earth and stomping witches a fate he finds enjoyable and highly remunerative. (If that curse seems counterproductive from the perspective of the original witch congratulate yourself on seeing the twist coming.) He reports to some vague Witch Council and hes partnered for centuries with helpmeet priests (Elijah Wood as the new guy; Michael Caine as the one in his last week before retirement) but the movie leaves it to you to work out the geeky specifics. That feels like trust rather than an omission In the press notes producer Mark Canton boasts of his actors deep Comic Con CVs saying ""I believe no one has ever put together a cast that features so many heroes of other mythological adventures."" Everyone involved knows the audience has seen enough movies TVs and comics to grasp a fantastical setup on the go so theres no info-dumping here about the films dreamwalking secret societies witch prisons rules of magic or why exactly Diesel plucks a fly from the flesh of a corpse. (And no one ever lays out what precisely the Catholics have to do with all this.)Instead Kaulders off to the hunt. Witches live among us but arent allowed to jack with humans; when they do Kaulder collars them for the councils judgment. This time Kaulder is investigating the death of a friend and the release of more-potent-than-usual magic -- and theres a suggestion that the council is covering something up. What follows is an urban-fantasy noir with crime scenes and clues and some inspired witchery. Kaulder suspects that the answers lie in repressed memories of that prologue battle so he enlists the aid of a bartender/potion-maker played by Rose Leslie (Game of Thrones) to plunge into his past; meanwhile the case shows us the highs and lows of Manhattans witch society.The story works out like you might expect. The joys are in the way director Breck Eisner like Diesel is earnest about this goofiness. His direction might not showcase the full wit of the script but it does honor its inventiveness If this is the kind of thing you think you enjoy its recommended for its gummy-bear tree its charred yet smoldering witch corpses its descent into the writhing tree-roots of hell some business with a pulsing ancient heart and the return of that flaming sword which of course is named Hexenbane -- how could it not be?The action is only intermittent which turns out to be a good thing since its shot and staged with little distinction. The sets and dialogue are more potent. And theres one instance of perfect dumb grandeur In a dark moment when it looks as if evil might blot out New York Caine gazes through a window and intones with great solemnity ""Look at you you great bitch of a morning."" Give him 1000 experience pointsNotesThe titles ambiguity -- is he the last witch who hunts or the last hunter of witches? -- is cleared up pretty quickly but it turns out to be a lie. As with Jedi theres always another.The film has nothing to do with James Morrows excellent novel The Last Witchfinder.The witch stuff is kind of creepy for a PG-13 but not as much as the seasons grandest witch-related entertainment the current run of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina from Archie comics by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and Robert Hack.

You know the one Head cocked slightly to one side eyes squinted mouth turned down a mixture of anguish confusion and mild gastric discomfort furrowing his brow. Its a gaze that has helped turn the stoic Dom Toretto into one of the definitive franchise characters of this century but as The Last Witch Hunter proves it only works if there are lots of fast cars and the Rock in its immediate vicinity. Diesel plays the titular hero an 800-year-old crusader named Kaulder cursed with eternal life by a powerful witch queen hellbent on eradicating the human race with plague-carrying insects. Kaulder thought he slayed the queen back in the Dark Ages but it turns out her evil heart still beats--literally as the organ is still in the possession of a series of priests chosen to assist Kaulder and who answer to a witch-hunting council called the Axe and Cross. Someone is seeking to resurrect the queen and its up to Kaulder to stop her from taking over the world with the power of ancient black magic and hilariously unconvincing digital effects. Kaulder is joined by his latest handler (Elijah Wood) his retired predecessor (Michael Caine) and a good witch (Rose Leslie) but this is Diesels film--hes also a producer--and he does not possess the on-screen electricity to overcome the absolutely leaden direction by Breck Eisner a poster boy for the dangers of nepotism (his father is the former chairman of Disney). Seemingly every time there was an opportunity to do something fun The Last Witch Hunter runs in the other direction creating an unfortunately heavy-handed humorless self-serious tone for a story that should be allowed to be a little goofy. It should be crazy fun on paper--Vin Diesel murders witches with a flaming sword--but the only thing The Last Witch Hunter will successfully eradicate is insomnia.

Photo Scott Garfield MOVIE REVIEW The Last Witch Hunter Running time 98 minutes. Rated PG-13 (fantasy violence). Between them Vin Diesel and Michael Caine have won two Oscars and its high time they joined forces. In ""The Last Witch Hunter"" they work together at last each of them seizing the opportunity to showcase his own special talent to say convey wry sagacity or to convey having just spent four hours blasting his trapezius muscles. Diesel wearing one of the least convincing chin wigs since Milhouse played Abe Lincoln on ""The Simpsons"" is Kaulder who 800 years ago did battle with the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) who with her dying breath cursed her killer to live forever. In todays Manhattan Kaulder and the priest sidekick (Caine) he calls ""kid"" celebrate a long history of catching sorcerers together. Theres a pact that witches will be left alone unless they harm humans but what penalty is there for screenwriters who harmed my human ears with dialogue like ""Youve got magic in your blood. Magic that can do very bad things""? Elijah WoodPhoto Scott Garfield Most Manhattan witches are content to hang out in an enchanted bar with candles and silks -- it looks like Stevie Nicks basement -- where a cute redheaded witch named Chloe (Rose Leslie) agrees to help Kaulder and another priest (Elijah Wood) solve a mystery that suggests the Witch Queens brand of evil is still alive. The movie left me amazed -- amazed that Nicolas Cage wasnt in it. Sorting out the storyline is like being Medusas barber. For director Breck Eisner and his screenwriters the magic word is ""randomly"" Randomly Eisner keeps whipping up freaky digital effects then explaining what happened later if at all. How are invisible bugs and butterflies being used to make cursed cupcakes? Randomly. Whats this giant spider that looks like a birds-nest Transformer and is alternately good or evil depending on whim? Hey at least its weird. Witches and Kaulder keep taking out enchanted vials and blowing powder this way and that with no ground rules laid out in advance to define how anything works. By the end of the movie were still not clear on such basics as whether its ideal for the Witch Queen to really be dead. Memo to screenwriters Try to figure out the movie youre working on before you worry about setting up the sequel.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan October 22 2015 Kaulder (Vin Diesel) is cursed in theory with eternal life in ""The Last Witch Hunter"" which he spends tracking truce breakers. (Scott Garfield/Lionsgate) It helps to think of ""The Last Witch Hunter"" as a paranormal police procedural. Set in New York City as cop shows often are its a story of a brooding investigator (Vin Diesel) trying to solve a crime involving an attack on his partner (Michael Caine). The main difference is the cop is 800 years old and the bad guys are witches. Why view it through the smudged and gritty lens of ""CSI"" ""NYPD Blue"" and the like when it works reasonably well as comic book eye candy? Because by fantasy standards its also dully derivative evoking everything from ""Seventh Son"" to the ""Harry Potter"" movies. As an episode of ""Law and Order Supernatural Victims Unit"" it at least gets the goofball kick it sorely needs. Diesel plays Kaulder a witch hunter born in Medieval Europe who is cursed with immortality by the witch queen he slays in the movies prologue (Julie Engelbrecht). Fast-forward to modern-day Manhattan where hes for all intents and purposes a police detective tracking down witches who have violated the truce worked out with mortals -- by manipulating the weather or some other magical infraction -- and bringing them before a tribunal at which point they do not get burned at the stake but locked up in an enchanted subterranean hoosegow. Much of Kaulders job seems to involve occult forensics collecting examining and interpreting dead flies soil samples bloody fingerprints and mystic runes written in window condensation. All that Sherlockian schlepping changes when Kaulders friend and Dr. Watson-like chronicler (Caine) a Roman Catholic priest from a secret order known as the Dolans is attacked and tortured. As the old man lies near death Kaulder must team with a new young priest (Elijah Wood) and a ""good"" witch (Rose Leslie) to determine who is behind the crime and what he or she wants. Im not saying this premise isnt ridiculous -- it is -- but from the skewed vantage point of a crime thriller its kind of fun. As Kaulder Diesel does what he does rumbling out lines of silly dialogue in his subwoofer of a voice. As far as acting goes theres not much. Kaulder is said to have been cursed yet he seems pretty darn content with his life sleeping with stewardesses tinkering with antique watches -- a metaphor for endless time? -- and sipping fine liquor in his posh condo in between collaring magical malefactors. Its not a bad life and Kaulder seems far from the stereotype of the jaded alcoholic flat-foot tortured by personal loss (as were meant to imagine he is via the frequent flashbacks were shown of his dead wife and daughter killed by a plague conjured by the witch queen). As for action the special-effects-laden fight scenes are ho-hum incoherent and badly lit. Its often hard to tell what some warlock or scorpion-like beast is doing and to whom. The supernatural mystery genre is hot right now. ""The Last Witch Hunter"" joins ""Grimm"" ""Sleepy Hollow"" and their small-screen ilk. Diesel doesnt cut it as a defender of the human race against the forces of hell. But hes not half bad as the next Sgt. Joe ""Freaky"" Friday. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains some coarse language action violence and scary images. 106 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Vin Diesel as Kaulder a 14th century knight in modern-day Manhattan in ""The Last Witch Hunter."" Photo Lionsgate Lets hope this Witch Hunter is the last 1 / 1 Back to Gallery There are two main obstacles to enjoying ""The Last Witch Hunter."" One is your ability to buy Vin Diesel as an immortal slayer of evildoers plying his trade in todays Manhattan. You also have to swallow a by-the-numbers plot buried under an avalanche of fast-and-furious but underwhelming CGI effects. We first meet the usually affable Diesel as a 14th century knight named Kaulder with braided beard hunting down the Witch Queen -- seriously ugly -- who has unleashed the Black Death to destroy the human race. As they battle she curses him with immortality. So hundreds of years later hes still pursuing witches living in a fancy Manhattan apartment but minus the beard and weird hairdo. Witches now co-exist with humans in an uneasy truce though the really bad ones are imprisoned. Kaulder keeps tabs on them smacking down the worst ones and working for a dynasty of Catholic priests known as the Dolan (Ill leave it to you to decide what thats supposed to mean). When the current Dolan (Michael Caine coasting) is put under a curse Kaulder works with his successor (Elijah Wood) to rescue him -- and of course the rest of humanity. This kind of quest demands plentiful special effects and thats what we get -- mostly images of fire disgusting bugs and creepy trees with slithering limbs. Along the way Kaulder acquires a lively sidekick (Rose Leslie who gives the movie a boost) a beneficent witch with special powers who runs a tavern serving various inebriating and magical potions. Director Breck Eisner (son of onetime Hollywood kingpin Michael Eisner) seems to be aiming squarely at the fanboys since many of the effects suggest role-playing video games with magical and medieval themes. The dialogue is heavy on menacing (and other) platitudes with very occasional and refreshing stabs at humor. I dont mind Diesel at all especially when hes winking at his musclebound macho image. But thats at a minimum in ""The Last Witch Hunter"" which instead tries to round out the character with soft-focus flashbacks to his long-lost family life. Theres enough goodwill for Diesel that hell survive this mess which is clearly intended to kick off a franchise. So what are the chances of a ""Witch Hunter II""? Id say nil. Walter Addiego is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. E-mail waddiegosfchronicle.com The Last Witch Hunter Fantasy action. Directed by Breck Eisner.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Rugged sword-and-sorcery heroes and hard-boiled detectives both have their origins in the pulp magazine tradition so its not that far-fetched to combine them as The Last Witch Hunter tries to do by casting Vin Diesel as an immortal medieval tough guy in a secret New York underworld of modern-day magicians. Muscling into magic-potion speakeasies and decrepit witch squats hidden behind gummy bear trees Diesels trench-coat-clad Kaulder encounters hookah-smoking octogenarian femme fatales kept young and beautiful by sorcery and shape-shifters who resemble fidgety meth tweakers in their true form. When he isnt using alchemy to dust crime scenes for spell fragments or getting knocked out by memory smoke (apparently the witching worlds equivalent of getting pistol-whipped on the back of the head) he beds stewardesses and fixes antique pocket watches in his Central Park pad. The script is geek central involving everything from Civil War trivia to role-playing game terminology and has its share of dork cool (e.g. the witches legal system in which jurists consult the tarot during the trial) so its a shame that The Last Witch Hunter ends up crumbling into another generic showdown of murky fantasy effects and snatched artifacts with a final shot that is literally framed around a door to possible sequels. Perhaps part of the blame rests on the current business model of franchises origin re-boots and pre-planned trilogies which has made the industry allergic to telling actual stories as though leaving audiences satisfied might keep them from coming back in two or three years. Nowadays effects-heavy fantasy flicks are generally made in halves or thirds and The Last Witch Hunter is no exception.Written by a brain trust of goofily over-serious dark fantasy franchise-launch veterans (Priests Cory Goodman Dracula Untolds Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless) The Last Witch Hunter is set in a world where magic is real but kept secret protected by a centuries-long peace accord between occult and religious authorities. Kaulder--who slew a witch queen back in the Middle Ages and was cursed to never die--works as the street muscle for a Catholic order confiscating illegal weather runes and nabbing the occasional warlock crook assisted by his secretary (Michael Caine) an elderly priest he addresses only as ""Kid."" Theres a definite charm to this mashup of gumshoe mystery and fantasy with Kaulder as the world-weary P.I. type whos earned his cynicism by actually being the oldest man on Earth. (Diesels understated charisma nightclub bouncer physique and deep croak of a voice--all used to great effect in the genre-crossing Riddick movies--help a lot.) If nothing else The Last Witch Hunter deserves some points for trying to visualize a world where magic is something like a tumorous outgrowth of the natural world eschewing dusty books and the usual indistinguishable globs of blue-green energy in favor of spells that erupt as swarms of butterflies or tangles of gnarled roots cast with pieces of Iceland spar and 55-gallon drums of cemetery dirt. And though its dialogue is riddled with comically clunky exposition (sample exchange ""We took all the most powerful witches in the world and put them in one place."" ""The witch prison"") the movie has just enough offbeat details and just enough of a sense of humor to feel a little lived-in.But then comes the intercut climax in which our hero--who up to that moment has solved problems with a combination of wits fists and flirting--breaks out the flaming sword to defeat a generic cackling evil that is poised to wipe out the human race despite having all of two henchmen and being not much more than a servant to future evils that will need defeating. The Last Witch Hunter is at its most appealing when its title character is just pounding the pavement and explaining clues out loud and at its most unremarkable when it angles for something bigger a series which the movie--either naively or cynically--presents as the destiny Kaulder must accept. Say what you will about the Joseph Campbell-style heros journey but at least its better than the heros contract extension.

(Scott Garfield) Movie review of ""The Last Witch Hunter"" Vin Diesel battles demons as the computer-generated special effects run riot. Rating 2 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer Hocus-pocus and hugger-mugger abound in ""The Last Witch Hunter"" which finds Vin Diesel in the title role battling (see title) in New York City. Spells are cast demons are destroyed and the computer-generated effects run riot throughout. Diesels character Kaulder is a brawny 800-year-old condemned to eternal life with the supposed last breath of the wrinkly Witch Queen (German-French actress Julie Engelbrecht much uglified by heavy prosthetic makeup). Movie Review     The Last Witch Hunter with Vin Diesel Elijah Wood Michael Caine Julie Engelbrecht Rose Leslie. Directed by Breck Eisner from a screenplay by Cory Goodman Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. 106 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images. Several theaters. Hes been knocking off her demonic spawn for centuries and frankly is getting a little tired of the whole business. But lately there have been portents that the old queen is reviving and so whore you going to call? You know who. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

The phrase ""hell to pay"" will not be a mere phrase in that dire case. Michael Caine who apparently has never met a script hes been able to turn down plays a priest who serves as best friend and adviser to Kaulder. Crowned with a stylish black fedora he provides the filmmakers with an excuse to give a tip of the literal hat to Max von Sydows iconic cleric in ""The Exorcist."" Caines performance like Diesels and every other actor in the cast is competent but unremarkable. The picture a far cry from ""The Exorcist"" offers nothing fresh. Its the kind of roller-coaster Hollywood churns out seemingly in its sleep oversaturated with effects shots and plot implausibilities. Ten minutes after youve seen it youll have forgotten all about it.

But the fantasy action-thrillers real draw is the fanciful and fantastic special effects like the witch with legs of loosely braided branches and the warlock who disappears in a dense cloud of indigo and ochre butterflies. Also showcased is one of the most beautiful apocalypses Ive ever seen the cars below and the skyscrapers above an empty downtown Manhattan boulevard conquered by lush vines and greedy lianas. But the narrative elasticity of magic -- you can do whatever you want whenever you want to whomever you want -- makes for a weightless story with little logic or stakes. The convoluted plot feels driven by the special effects instead of the other way around. Witches and warlocks are formidable until theyre not and fragile as a sugar cube when director Breck Eisner (""The Crazies"" ""Sahara"") has a new visual he wants to show off. Also Read Vin Diesel Plays a Round of Dungeons amp; Dragons for Damp;Diesel (Video) ""The Last Witch Hunter"" aims for pulpy comic-book fun but its never as fleet funny or detailed as it needs to be. And if youre looking for something above middling in terms of plot characters world-building even action sequences youll need to seek it elsewhere. Vin Diesel stars as Kaulder a witch hunter whos been keeping the supernaturally inclined population in check for the last 800 years. Cursed with immortality by the sorceress he killed Kaulder has finally reached a truce with the witch community as long as they dont harm humans hell leave them alone. His exploits are chronicled by the priestly Dolan 36th (Michael Caine apparently in the market for a new house) whos quickly murdered and replaced by the rookie Dolan 37th (Elijah Wood). Also Read Vin Diesel Faces Down Body-Shaming Trolls About Dad Bod Photos I Can Take It (Video) The cinematic equivalent of Velveeta Diesel is unmistakably modern and synthetic. In his brief scenes with Caine he comes across as amateurish next to the screen legend and his every utterance of ""Hey kid"" to the elderly British actor sink with waxen forcedness. Bereft of gravitas and chemistry Diesel pantomimes but cant reach Kaulders pathos about having been alone for nearly a millennium; hes too wooden to have a weak spot. Nor can he sell the former Vikings centuries-old attachment to his wife and daughter who obtrude in visions and hallucinations as persistently and as irritatingly as phone calls from a clingy ex. Its a relief when the crackling Rose Leslie (""Game of Thrones"") enters the picture as Kaulders sidekick-love interest Chloe a witch with the power to undo some of the mind-control spells aimed his way. Leslie doesnt have much to do but the script (by Cory Goodman Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless) at least allows itself some levity during her scenes. When she initially knocks out Kaulder with a hex (at his request) she crouches by his head squeals ""The last witch hunter"" and takes a selfie next to his passed-out body. Later Kaulder teases her for signing up for witch-identity mailing lists that call him a ""genocidal fascist."" (Too bad the tangled storyline couldnt tie itself in one more knot to include a classroom scene about Paranormal-American studies.) The rest of the movie isnt clever enough -- and the plight and power of the witches too ill defined -- for the script to keep dragging down the proceedings by giving Chloe the blues about her peoples oppression. And while its delightfully dorky to watch fight scenes in which the weapons include swinging axes flaming swords and sparkly pixie dust the editing is occasionally so choppy its difficult to discern whats happening on screen. Also Read Vin Diesel Used Last Witch Hunter to Ease Pain of Paul Walkers Death The storyline slows to a crawl in the third act which is mostly an excuse to blow the budget in the special-effects bay. But the magic is gone by then having exhausted itself and its audience. You know youre in a cauldron of trouble when even a glistening gummy-bear tree can no longer sweeten the pot.

Daily Edition Login to download The Last Witch Hunter Film Review 130 PM PDT 10/19/2015 by Stephen Dalton FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Big on spectacle but low on magic. TWITTER Vin Diesel stars in this fantasy-action extravaganza as an immortal warrior battling witches and warlocks in contemporary New York. Clearly aiming to be the first chapter in a big-budget action franchise Vin Diesels latest star vehicle is a 90 million supernatural thriller which proves to be as good as it needs to be but no more. The Last Witch Hunter methodically ticks a checklist of fan-friendly boxes from its heavy dependence on visual effects to its international cast of fantasy genre veterans including Michael Caine Elijah Wood and Game of Thrones alumni Rose Leslie. Producing as well as starring the 47-year-old Diesel casts himself in an indestructible hero whose immortal bad-ass status recalls previous blockbuster folklore reboots like Highlander Blade and Underworld. If theres something evil in your neighborhood who you gonna call? Witch Hunter The director is Breck Eisner son of former Disney CEO Michael who struggles to wring much sense or wit from an overcooked script which is more mythological than logical. Having replaced Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch Wanted) on the project Breck does a solid journeyman job but a nagging suspicion lingers that the Russian action auteur might have goosed up this formulaic material with more of his signature visual flair and gonzo energy. That said The Last Witch Hunter tickles enough fanboy pleasure zones to lure the vast global army who made Diesels Riddick and Fast and Furious franchises into a multi-billion-dollar business. Diesel stars as Kaulder a grieving father cursed with immortality by the Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht) who unleashed the Black Death on mankind way back in the Middle Ages killing his wife and daughter. Strikingly shot in a vast snowy wilderness this origin story opens the movie and later becomes a recurring motif in flashback. Diesels wild hair-and-beard combo in these scenes falling somewhere between Brooklyn hipster and Norwegian death metal guitarist brings a welcome note of accidental camp comedy to an otherwise largely mirth-free movie. Fast forward 800 years to present-day New York (mostly Pittsburgh standing in) and Kaulder is now a clean-shaven bullet-headed sharp-dressed witch hunter working for a shadowy organization called the Axe and Cross which appears to be a secret paramilitary wing of the Catholic church. Think Men In Black but scripted by Dan Brown. Though a fragile centuries-old truce keeps most witches from meddling in human affairs some nefarious necromantics still break the rules. Naturally between missions Kaulder is also something of an irresistible playboy womanizer with a palatial apartment overlooking Central Park a personal armory of kick-ass weapons including a flaming sword and a flashy new Aston Martin. Diesels pitch to become the next James Bond starts here. The contemporary storyline begins with the sudden death of Kaulders longtime friend and mentor Dolan the 36th reliably played by Caine in grandfatherly post-Batman mode. After sniffing out evidence of black magic the witch hunter teams up with Dolans young successor Dolan the 37th (Wood) and benign white witch Chloe (Leslie) in a race against time to track down a powerful Nordic warlock called Belial (Olafur Darri Olafsson) who plans to resurrect the Witch Queen and unleash a fresh global plague. Ding dong The witch is not dead. Thus the stage is set for an apocalyptic second showdown between Kaulder and his evil nemesis. And this time its personal. The one truly impressive thing about Diesels acting skills is how he has achieved so much with so little. All smirk and bicep he was once earmarked as the natural successor to Bruce Willis. But more recently he seems to have settled comfortably into Steven Segal mode a walking bag of boiled ham whose expressive range barely extends beyond sleepy-eyed guttural grunts. In The Last Witch Hunter he acts opposite an immobile corpse and a wooden tree monster yet still somehow manages to be stiffer than both. In fairness these limitations are unlikely to deter the movies action-fan target demographic. Still having such a wooden lead playing such a one-dimensional hero definitely makes it less appealing for casual movie goers. In its favor The Last Witch Hunter boasts some terrific production design and digital effects notably the Witch Queens lair and a creature called the Sentinel both nightmarish pagan constructions of shape-shifting wood and bone. A couple of late plot twists also feel refreshingly left-field even if they are shameless signposts for future sequels. Less impressively Eisners movie is clogged with cardboard characters flat dialogue and a sluggish middle act that gets lost in too much fabricated witchy folklore. Steve Jablonskys ever-present over-insistent orchestral score also grates on the nerves before long. Fast and furious on the surface shallow and conventional beneath Diesels bid to carve himself another billion-dollar franchise is off to a good start with this mainstream crowd-pleaser.

Like a sausage-faced gender-flipped Buffy the Vampire Slayer Vin Diesel plays Kaulder a man on an epic quest to battle the dark forces of magical femininity under the watchful eye of his fusty British handler Dolan (Michael Caine). But when Dolan is attacked by an ancient evil Kaulder teams up with good witch Chloe (Rose Leslie) to prevent the magical apocalypse. Give The Last Witch Hunter some credit though unlike say Lesbian Vampire Killers it does go some way towards muting the inherent misogyny in the concept largely by making a couple of the witches dudes. Also there are two fun minutes near the beginning when This Is England legend Joe Gilgun turns up as a snarling tattooed Irish nutter. Otherwise this is a relentlessly unengaging affair its derivative and logic-deficient script matched by flat direction and fussy unconvincing CGI. The performances are particularly rotten we expect Vin to wobble about like a half-inflated penis balloon with a face scrawled on it but Caine and Elijah Wood (playing his fellow priest) should know better; and the cut-glass-posh Leslie is simply unbearable - picture Princess Beatrice on a gap year working in a Manhattan goth bar. A hideous electro mangling of the Stones Paint It Black over the closing credits adds insult to injury. But hey at least that means its over.

"The Last Witch Hunter Review Vin Diesel Wages a Dreary War on Evil | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review The Last Witch Hunter Guy Lodge Film Critic guylodge 11 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Summit Entertainment October 19 2015 | 0130PM PT The title should prove prophetic for this dreary CGI-infested occult thriller starring Vin Diesel as an immortal enemy of evil. One of the trickier tasks Vin Diesels eponymous hero faces in ""The Last Witch Hunter"" is tracking a villain by his signature scent of ""moldering crabapples"" -- a distinctive enough fragrance in its own right but hard to separate from the generally funky aroma of decomposition that permeates Breck Eisners limp lame-brained occult thriller. Too drab to succeed even as defiantly unvirtuous trash  this era-straddling tale of an immortal medieval warrior protecting modern-day New York from a Black Death reboot stifles Diesels rough-hewn charisma via a sludgy impermeable oil spill of CGI effects -- in the service of largely unspectacular hocus pocus. Despite a pre-Halloween release date the pic is more gung-ho than gooseflesh-inclined in genre; either way its unlikely to mint the franchise threatened by its eminently welcome ending. Commercially given the extraordinary expanding cultural impact of the ""Fast and Furious"" series ""The Last Witch Hunter"" might expect to ride on Diesel fumes to an extent. Yet if its aim is to reposition him as a solo action star perhaps re-engaging the dwindling audience for the ""Riddick"" films this new vehicle doesnt really play to his strengths -- despite being developed and co-produced by the actor himself. Barring an early (and swiftly discarded) reference to his characters prowess as a ladies man theres precious little room here for Diesels lunkish slightly self-parodic streak of humor. And if its hard to buy the star as a 14th-century soldier of the Catholic Church earnestly slaying sorceresses for 700 years without a wrinkle to show for it the screenplay (bearing evident redrafting scars from a trio of scribes) doesnt make much of an effort to sell the idea. For starters its uncertain where our noble witch-hunter Kaulder actually comes from Based on scant evidence in the pre-credit prologue lets say its the little-remembered European land of Snowsylvania though eight centuries has been long enough for him to adopt Diesels trademark gravelly drawl. Its probably unwise to demand more detailed a milieu from a film that claims the Black Death plague of 1346-53 was in fact foisted upon humanity by a vindictive Witch Queen (Julie Engelbrecht or whats left of her beneath a maggoty digital mask) bent on total human eradication. Luckily Kaulder -- sporting a braided beard and luscious undercut that would not be out of place in contemporary Williamsburg -- has our backs wasting the Queen in a murky introductory battle. Not before she afflicts him with the curse of immortality however thus consigning him to a lonely life of winnowing out her mangy kind haunted by the memory of his long-perished wife and daughter. He looks good on it though even if the on-trend locks are swiftly sacrificed for Diesels standard minimalist coiffure. In present-day Manhattan he lives in relatively comfortable torment in a plush Upper East Side loft seducing the occasional air stewardess and accepting international witch-hunting assignments from a succession of priestly advisers known as Dolans. The latest of these Dolan 36th takes the typically jovial form of Michael Caine whose helpfully explanatory voiceover is unceremoniously dropped shortly after it begins -- and shortly before hes dispatched to his coffin in mysterious circumstances. Suspecting foul play specifically of the ""fair is foul and foul is fair"" variety Kaulder begins the search for the Weird Sister responsible with Dolans dormouse-like successor (Elijah Wood decidedly under-burdened) in tow. From here on the investigation plays out not unlike a super-sized episode of ""Murder She Wrote"" only with more shape-shifting ghouls and fire-strewn showdowns between good and evil. He also happens upon a spunky good-witch ally in dark-arts club owner Chloe (cannily cast ""Games of Thrones"" alum Rose Leslie) whose initial surliness and plethora of Hot Topic accessories conceal a rare command of ""dream-walking"" a strain of mind-altering white magic. As they follow the breadcrumb trail around a city that seems markedly oblivious to the insect tornadoes and snaking ""plague trees"" springing up overnight -- Pittsburgh fills in unsteadily for the Big Apple though its not the least credible performance here -- it becomes clear that the long-vanquished Queen has returned for another crack at earthly domination. Offering auds nary a wink to the dim absurdity of his mission Diesel trudges dourly through the proceedings practically expectorating dialogue that is in fairness pretty hard to play with. (""They took all the most powerful witches in the world and put them in one place"" observes one character. ""The witch prison"" comes the memorable response.) Leslie brings glimmers of gumption to her conveniently abled sidekick role; she at least appears to be having more fun than formidable thesps like Rena Owen (""Once Were Warriors"") as a stern member of an underground witch-control council and most bizarrely Isaach De Bankole as a blind Ivorian bakery owner and mystic herb merchant named -- for reasons of apparent script inflexibility -- Max Schlesinger. Perhaps he could have swapped roles with Caine who appears to be doing some less supernatural dream-walking of his own in several scenes. There are certainly enough dopey diversions here for ""The Last Witch Hunter"" to be considerably more fun than it is but even its most extravagant bouts of silliness are hampered by desultory plotting and Eisners oppressively synthetic mise-en-scene. Dean Semlers lensing has a dull slickness that mostly defers to the pics Marmite-colored morass of visual effects which are somehow as tawdry-looking as they are conceptually elaborate. The pics climactic face-off between human and Hexan is a particular letdown heavily recycling both the character conflicts and the cockroach-and-brimstone imagery of the intro; its hard not to wish that Kaulder had simply done a more thorough job 700 years ago and spared us all the trouble. ""Can you feel it -- your life your mortality -- ebbing away?"" bellows the Queen Witch in her final fight. Whether shes addressing Kaulder or the audience is open to question.

Amie Marnie says March 19 2016 at 451 am I thought this was a brilliant film...ive just rented+paid to watch it on virgin on-demand id give it an 8 out of 10 really liked it+would watch it again Reply Angelo Suppa says November 1 2015 at 822 pm Your review and score is too harsh lighten some Reply Jan says October 20 2015 at 231 pm I think you accidentally used a pic of Tom Hanks from CASTAWAY at the top of your review. Reply bob says October 20 2015 at 1029 am This Eisner guy hardly David Lean is he? A bunch of bad movies. Well dad Eisner has him well set-up with the trust fund I am sure. Whatever becomes of this movie director thing he keeps trying at. Reply Bill B. says October 20 2015 at 1009 am Whatever its supposed to be it sounds bad and he looks ridiculous. Not a chance I would pay a dime to see it. Big flop. Reply Carlo says October 19 2015 at 214 pm Oh Lord Another one of those awful sour-faced reviewers who never met a film he DID like. Probably like all those other morons he never showed up on the set of a film to see what it takes to make one even if it turns out to be bad which I suspect this one isnt. This guy should go get a real job but most likely doesnt have any skills except to dump on other peoples work. Reply God says October 19 2015 at 410 pm Your Vin Diesel man-crush is ADORBS Reply Mike says October 20 2015 at 1126 am you are a moron. This reviewer has given plenty of positive reviews. You could argue that a lot of people work hard to erect a building. But if its ugly and collapsed killing a bunch of people the hard work is pretty much moot. A bad movie us usually not the fault of the people on the set. It is the execs and producers who develop the script and rush it into production despite the fact that its a bad idea with a bad script. This is a vanity project for Vin who only has any leverage because hes lucky enough to be in the FF franchise. This is another example of a studio throwing a bunch of cheesy VFX at the screen to make up for a terrible story knowing they can probably make up for it at the foreign box office. Michael Caine and some of the other actors are just whoring out their talents for some . Caine sold his soul a long time ago - see JAWS 4 - so he deserves no sympathy. Breck Eisner is a lousy director with no vision - as has been proven by his last endeavors - but his daddy pretty much bought him his career back in the day. Im sure all the decent directors passed on the ""Vin Diesel Witch Hunting movie."" So stop your whining. Think of all the great indie movies that could have been made for the price of this piece of crap. Amalgamate says October 19 2015 at 242 pm Critics dont need to visit film sets dumdum-they review FINISHED films and this one looks indeed like a shit sandwich Reply Crimson Peak ROOLS says October 19 2015 at 155 pm Boy the reviewer really was off the mark on this one. Its not supposed to be a thriller. Its supposed to be a gothic romance Reply Andy says October 20 2015 at 1128 am uh no its really not. Have you seen any of the materials? It may attempt some romance but it is intended as a thriller/supernatural adventure film. Anyway it misses its mark whatever the intention.
