Latest formula reheating of snotty (white) outsiders vs. plucky (black) homies is a serviceable youth pic thats marginally less dumb than Novembers urban quasi-musical ""Honey."" ""Served"" should score a couple of heady weeks. If each decade must have its own ""Breakin 2 Electric Boogaloo"" things could be worse than ""You Got Served."" Latest formula reheating of snotty (white) outsiders vs. plucky (black) homies is a serviceable youth pic thats marginally less dumb than Novembers urban quasi-musical ""Honey."" Pic wont be more than a blip on the radar for most grownups but if nonstop screams and squeals from a largely under-15 preview aud are any sign ""Served"" should score a couple of heady weeks among those who spend their afterschool hours with MTV and BET. Making his feature directorial bow musicvid veteran and producer/manager (notably of Ramp;B group B2K whose members fill several roles here) Christopher B. Stokes also wrote the script which has a storyline so simple even little kids wont find it a challenge to follow it. Elgin (Marques Houston of IMX) and David (Omari Grandberry aka Omarion of B2K whos Houstons real-life brother) are best friends who lead an L.A. street-dancing troupe that performs regularly at the neighborhood venue run by Mr. Rad (Steve Harvey). Strapped for cash the two young men also run occasional questionably legal errands for local crime boss Emerald (Jabba the Hut-like Michael ""Bear"" Taliferro). David has a reputation as a Casanova but Elgin draws the line when David gets serious about Elgins comely little sister Liyah (Jennifer Freeman). This rift develops into a chasm when Elgin is jumped and robbed on a solo delivery mission for Emerald -- while David who should have been watching his back was out making time with Liyah. Resulting bad blood splinters their dance crew just as they are invited to compete in a big MTV dance-off. However when a tyke is killed in a drive-by shooting the protags reunite for the dance-off beating back a straight-outta-Orange-County crew led by sneering spiky-haired wigger Wade (Christopher Jones). Prize is 50000 and a spot in a new video starring Lil Kim (one of many personalities playing themselves in cameos here). As Mr. Rad puts it ""Money isnt the important thing friendship is."" But hey friendship plus money is even better. Ultra-baggy hip-hop fashion trends of the last few years dont ideally complement dance moves nor does the usual overactive musicvid-bred editorial approach. Nonetheless main attraction here is the large number of body-rocking segs. They showcase dynamic old-school breakdancing plus mind-boggling acrobatics and even a little modern-dance/musical theater-influenced choreography. Its easy to forget the eminently forgettable plot when so many feet are flying. Perfs are as good as they need to be which (off the competition floor at least) is just competent. Only notable weak link is dewy ingenue Freeman (from ABC sitcom ""My Wife and Kids"") who seems to have wandered in from ""Valley Girl 2."" She makes a line like ""Your boy is really trippin "" sound uncomfortably close to ""Omigawd Gag me with a spoon"" Harveys comic chops are barely tapped. Design and tech aspects are nondescript You have to think the music supervisor was running out of ideas when de rigueur wall-to-wall soundtrack of hip-hop and neo-soul cuts -- featuring Timbaland Ludacris Method Man DMX Redman several from B2K etc. -- finds room for a dance-floor version of ""Fur Elise.""

Sure the directions shambolic the acting laughable the script amateurish the editing clumsy the plot no more than a laboured device for getting from set-piece A to set-piece B in as quick and corny a fashion as possible. But is it the worst ever? At heart an extended promo for now-defunct commercial teeny hip hop band B2K this is a handful of breathtaking dance sequences stitched together by very bad acting. It follows the members of a South Californian breakdancing crew hoping to win a dance competition and get out of the ghetto. Everything else is incidental and fills time between terrific scenes of hardcore rug-burning in which gangs of dancers meet in crowded warehouses and throw down choice insults before aggressively trying to formation- dance their opponents off the stage. Its like a hip hop haka. Only the most curmudgeonly would consider it wholly unwatchable.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr C+ You Got Served Genre Drama; Starring Marques Houston Omari Grandberry Steve Harvey Christopher Jones Lil Kim; Director Chris Stokes; Author Chris Stokes; Release Date Wide 01/30/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 93; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Screen Gems Inc. Posted February 4 2004 -- 1200 AM EST Street dancing (or what Reagan-era children like me used to call break dancing) is half sport half art; a duality that makes it fascinating for about 15 minutes - and a little exhausting for the remaining 78 it takes You Got Served to tie up its perfunctory Cinderella story line. At their best the hood-raised underdogs at stage center led by fractious friends David and Elgin (hip-hop artists and close friends Omari Grandberry and Marques Houston) unleash their dance talents in the form of mini-theater pieces punctuated by breathtaking feats of strength. (""Matrix""-like slo-mo moves are accomplished without wires or computers - its like turbocharged yoga.) But this degenerates into monotonous crotch-thrusting move-busting swagger - an extended commercial for the performers surly virtuosity. Meanwhile David and Elgin must settle some highly scripted differences and win ""just enough money to change our lives"" in (yup) a climactic contest. The story is so bored with itself it collapses - but the diverse troupe of dance talents at least makes it an eclectic slide.

Starring Omari Grandberry Marques Houston. Directed and written by Christopher J. Stokes. (PG-13. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Look at what ""8 Mile"" and ""Bring It On"" have wrought a street-dance film thats lively and silly and about as ""street"" as a Britney Spears video. Director Christopher Stokes manager of the boy group B2K wrote ""You Got Served"" as a showcase for group member Omari Grandberry and the youngster has enormous appeal. Grandberry recently left B2K but he shows the stuff of a solo star especially when he dances. ""You Got Served"" starts with an electrifying face-off number. As the bass pounds the dancers gyrate pose and perform gravity-defying handstands. The scene is intensified by its setting a sparely lit boxing ring and by the medium and close shots of the kids athletic maneuverings. The trouble begins when the dancing ends. Robert Altman director of the very different dance movie ""The Company"" knew the dance was the thing even at the expense of story. Stokes however tends to kill momentum by devoting long stretches to a hackneyed story. Grandberry doesnt act exactly but his genial presence is so inviting that he rarely hits a false note. Thats why the dumbest story line is one that has Grandberrys character David and his pal Elgin (recording artist Marques Houston Grandberrys brother) carry drugs for a neighborhood dealer. Exuding the decidedly non-thuggish air of a kid groomed for pop stardom Grandberry cant pull this off. In a rip-off from ""Bring It On"" a group of white Orange County youths beat David and Elgins South Central squad in the contest by stealing their moves. Having lost 5000 some of it from Elgins grandmother the guys resort to desperate measures. That they started transporting drugs before this ever happened ruins the effect when they do it again. The friends become rivals partly because David starts dating Elgins gorgeous sister (Jennifer Freeman matching Grandberrys sweetness). Grandberry and Houston are shown in competing shots their characters divided by conflict but joined in the need to dance shirtless in the rain. People get beat up play a lot of basketball and die. Gritty drama like this can only have one conclusion and thats a big-time dance contest judged by Lil Kim (demure in a lame bikini). The auditorium where the dancers have their final showdown seems sterile compared with the boxing ring. But Stokes breathes life into the battle with a wild group finale. The participants become a blur but the energy is undeniable. -- Advisory This film contains violence.

"Only youth is Served by silly dance film - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Only youth is Served by silly dance film By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 30 2004 Wednesday night I was at a screening of the shoddily written and directed dance-battle flick ""You Got Served."" The girls around me were at the most electrifying rock concert of their lives.When D (Omari Grandberry) and L (Marques Houston) practiced their moves in slow motion as a driving rain soaked their sweatpants and bare chests the girls whooped in ecstasy. When L got jumped and beaten for the unspecified but presumably drug-related contents of his gym bag the girls screamed in terror. When D socked L after L called his own little sister a ho they screamed some more. Then there was the moment the plus-size neighborhood dealer pulled up in his hearse of an Escalade to collect the cash L owed him.By this point the girls were spent -- the movie was putting them through the wringer. And that was before D and L patched things up and made a run for the 50000 prize at the big dance-off against the two white dudes and their crew from the O.C. (sorry Orange County).The audiences exclamatory response strongly suggests that a significant segment of the population is woefully underserved There just arent a lot of movies aimed at young Latina and black women. So for lasses of a certain age and musical inclination ""You Got Served"" -- which stars B2K the sexed-up teen foursome responsible for such gyrate-now-ask-questions-later hits as ""Uh Huh"" and ""Bump Bump Bump"" -- is a sweaty piece of heaven.B2Ks songs were never really as important as the exposure of their washboard stomachs and for the most part ""You Got Served"" and its acting are just as flat. As of this writing the sad news is that the group has broken up which makes watching B2Ks first picture together all the more painful knowing its their last.One can see what friction there might have been between the gang. Half the movie belongs to B2K front man Grandberry known to his squealing public as Omarion. (Its a name that conjures thoughts of pyramids and a young bride named Isis.) The other half belongs to Houston another reliably underdressed Ramp;B pinup. The rest of B2K -- Lil Fizz Raz-B and J-Boog -- have sub-supporting roles. Theyre backup dancers in their own film fantasy.""You Got Served"" is part soap opera and part thriller and it has the unique characteristic of being both undeveloped and overwritten. Writer director and former B2K manager Chris Stokes offers a drive-by shooting a love story a tough grandmother D and Ls bickering their crews rivalry with the O.C. all that dancing several miraculous reversals of fortune and at the last minute Lil Kim whos as bodacious as ever.But its the witty dancing that keeps the stock characters lackluster performances and ludicrous plot from sending you into a coma. As long as rumps are shaking the movies exhilarating. Everything else is urban boilerplate. Of course Americas breathless 12-year-old city girls might have something to say about that.(""You Got Served"" ) Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Omari Grandberry and Marques Houston buff the floors the hard way in You Got Served. Screen Gems Theres neither a summons nor a subpoena to be had in this movie. And dull as a film exploring the life of a legal clerk might be it probably would be an improvement over what actually appears on the screen. The films title is a slang phrase that in the context of this hip-hop dance movie means roughly that someone showed you up. In this case the showing up is done on the streets of Los Angeles between rival factions of dancing teens. The dance moves -- a kind of a break dancing/rhythmic gymnastics hybrid -- are a long way from the jazzy style of the Jets and the Sharks of the classic West Side Story but the rivalry between factions of street dancers is not all that different. Marques Houston (from the rap group IMX) plays a tightly coiled young man who lives with his mother and sister and sees street dancing as a way to provide for his family. His best buddy is played by Omari Grandberry a cooler calmer guy who also is determined to make a career of street dancing. About the show You Got Served 1/5 (out of four) Stars Marques Houston Omari Grandberry Steve Harvey Director Christopher B. Stokes Distributor Screen Gems Rating PG-13 for thematic elements and sexual references Opens nationwide Friday The two friends have a dance crew but after a misunderstanding go their separate ways. Besides that obstacle theres a rival crew from Orange County led by an obnoxious blond tough Christopher Jones who bears an eerie resemblance to Billy Idol. Its heartening to see a multiracial teen movie set in an urban environment that doesnt center on gangs violence or drugs. But its too bad more energy wasnt devoted to fleshing out the one-dimensional characters and crafting a decent script. The only reason to catch this harmless diversion is for the group dance sessions.
