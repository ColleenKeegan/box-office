Starring Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise. Directed by Brian De Palma. (Rated PG. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) What is it about outer space that enlarges the empty space between the ears? Brian De Palmas ""Mission to Mars"" has landed -- which is more than NASAs did the last time around -- but it sure is spacey. This sci-fi fantasy about a rescue mission to the Red Planet is a very mixed bag rhapsodic cinematography several genuine shocks amid a suffocating air of gooeyness impressive visual effects -- even if some seem to exist in a vacuum -- and an absolutely loony conclusion. There are two missions to Mars. When the first meets apparent disaster a rescue team is dispatched. Tim Robbins and Gary Sinise play the astronaut co-pilots. The second team also gets into trouble and if the people behind ""Mission to Mars"" had left it at that and played out the thrills it might have been something. No such luck. The movie meanders into space-mystico mumbo jumbo. Were supposed to share the characters awe at the wonder of the universe but more likely the audience will wonder whatever were the filmmakers thinking. Its going to make some people long for the monsters of ""Pitch Black"" the other space movie out there which keeps looking better by comparison. What does the enormous expenditure of talent and technology in ""Mission to Mars"" lead to? Something so sappy no one would believe me if I told them. It has to be seen to be disbelieved. Its not necessarily De Palmas fault. The director does whats required of him and the movie has its moments. His long roving takes are effective enough in shots of the weightless astronauts. There is a quick cut from home base in Texas to the red soil of Mars and a toylike robot rover -- the enormous set fascinates with its rocky surface and sepia sky. Later there will be another quick cut to dazzling white. The spacecraft is an enormous cylinder girded by a revolving circular chamber. Inside its grandly turning interior it seems as though were in Kubrick ""2001"" territory. We certainly are when the HAL-like voice of the computer comes on. Commander Woody Blake (Robbins) is nonchalant but practical with a do-what-has-to-be-done attitude. Co-pilot Jim McConnell (Sinise) is dreamy but hollow-eyed and wounded from the recent death of his astronaut wife. The rescue effort also includes Blakes astronaut wife (Connie Nielsen). The audience is supposed to share this teams mutual concern for each other but the film becomes lugubrious and the prompts from the oleaginous music dont help. The nightmare of an astronaut losing his tether and floating off through all eternity turns into a space opera. There is a scene of the evolution of running creatures that however irrelevant involves magnificent morphing. In this spacecraft the weightlessness extends to the dialogue. ""Mission to Mars"" starts to go off course when McConnells late wife she declares on a videotape ""The universe is not chaos. It is connection. Life reaches out for life."" Sinise and Robbins a couple of awfully good actors are asked to speak some awfully clunky lines. When Robbins says ""OK were ready to light this candle"" before ignition it sounds like a parody of astronaut lingo. ""Low gravity can have an adverse impact on the brain"" Nielsen informs us. And on movies too. ..

"Mission to Mars | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mission-to-mars ) Mission to Mars (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli Forget The Bonfire of the Vanities. With Mission to Mars director Brian De Palma has reached a new nadir. Easily the worst movie to date of 2000 (although the year is still young...) Mission to Mars beats out such worthy contenders as Supernova Eye of the Beholder and Isnt She Great. Ineptly directed badly acted and scripted with an eye towards stupidity and incoherence the film is worthwhile only to those who are in desperate need of a nap. And as is often the case when a big budget high profile motion picture self-destructs this one does so in spectacular fashion. Sifting through the rubble the only salvagable element is Ennio Morricones score - music that while not among the composers top work is infinitely better than anything else in this misbegotten movie. Science fiction movies are often derivative some moreso than others. The best sci-fi pictures borrow familiar themes and devices then combine and re-invigorate those elements in a manner that allows them to seem fresh and enjoyable. In bad films however there exists the pervasive sense of tiredness and the lack of energy that often comes from lackluster copycatting. The inspiration (and I hesistate to use that word in any context associated with this movie) for Mission to Mars is apparently Close Encounters of the Third Kind but there are also steals from Contact Apollo 13 The Abyss and even 1999s The Mummy. It has been more than a decade since De Palma has crafted anything worth watching. (Im referring to 1987s The Untouchables.) Best known throughout his career for imitating Hitchcock the filmmaker seems like an odd choice to direct what is supposed to be a relatively cerebral space adventure. The result is chaotic and unbalanced with De Palma ripping off everyone from Stanley Kubrick to Ron Howard in a desperate attempt to do something with the unworkable script he was handed. Admittedly its unfair to lay all the blame for Mission to Mars at De Palmas feet. Writers Jim Thomas John Thomas and Graham Yost deserve an equal share for a screenplay that is lacking in both intelligence and credibility. Their work here makes the human interest aspects of Armageddon seem well realized by comparison. Stripped of the rotted flesh that comprises the screenplay the premise underlying Mission to Mars has promise. The concept of a long lonely journey through space to the red planet followed by unexpected revelations about the origins of life on Earth could provide involving adventure and drama - just not the way its handled in this production. If the details were right the framework alone could provide the requisite suspense to keep an audience interested. Here however several contrived situations are grafted into the plot to generate artificial tension. None of these grossly improbable and obviously scripted moments works on any level. In fact one supposedly taut and emotional moment (involving the ""heroic"" death of a character) provoked laughter from the audience - definitely not the intended reaction. Mission to Mars which takes place around the year 2020 begins with a series of lame character building moments that introduce the five principals all of whom are NASA astronauts. They are Jim McConnell (Gary Sinise) a Mars expert who has been barred from interplanetary travel because of psychological repercussions resulting from the death of his wife; Luc Goddard (Don Cheadle) the captain of the first manned mission to Mars; the husband-and-wife team of Woody and Terry Blake (Tim Robbins and Connie Nielsen) who are slated for an upcoming mission; and Phil Ohlmyer (Jerry OConnell) a member of Woodys crew. These scenes which transpire during a bon voyage picnic for Luc feature lengthy bouts of dialogue-driven exposition as characters explain to each other things that they already know. (It goes something like this ""Jim you should be going on this mission; unfortunately since the tragic death of your beloved wife you have been declared psychologically unfit and have to stay behind."") Eventually the film gets around to chronicling the first mission - something it does perfunctorily with no sense of the wonder awe and media frenzy one would expect. The ordinariness accorded to the event makes it seem like the astronauts are on a routine orbit around the Earth. Of course something goes wrong NASA loses contact with the four explorers and a rescue mission has to be mounted. Its astonishing how many bad choices Mission to Mars makes. The film ignores an obvious source of possible suspense. Communications from Mars to Earth take 20 minutes. This delay could easily be exploited but the filmmakers drop it almost as soon as it is introduced preferring instead to concentrate on things like a homicidal sandstorm. One thing that makes Mission to Mars action sequences so laughable is the poor quality of the special effects. In an era when even small budget movies can boast effective visuals the kind of cheesiness evident in Mission to Mars is unacceptable. Members of the cast will probably do their best to hide this credit on their resumes perhaps claiming that what appears to be them are actually digitally generated facsimiles. That at least would explain the plastic style of acting. The normally reliable Gary Sinise and Don Cheadle are especially disappointing. Meanwhile Armin Mueller-Stahls performance is the kind of overwrought job one would expect in a parody. In fact if I didnt know better I would swear that he mistook Mission to Mars for a comedy. Mission to Mars is at least instructive in illustrating how wrong a supposedly ""cant miss"" prospect can go. In general the public loves science fiction but there are levels to which even the most undiscriminating viewer will not sink and Mission to Mars reaches those. From beginning to end theres not a worthwhile moment to be uncovered. With this effort De Palma has proven that The Bonfire of the Vanities was less of a fluke than one might suppose.

But we knew that. Weve seen the spaceship landing in Close Encounters of the Third Kind; weve seen the interplanetary lovefest of E.T. From sci-fi movies made by baby boomers who grew up reading Isaac Asimov and watching The Outer Limits we know that all intelligent life in the universe wants to phone home. And this middle-aged desire to make movies about galaxies filled with nice new friends to play with can reduce even hard-nosed veteran filmmakers to awkward babbling boys in the presence of NASA technical advisers. Look what its done to Brian De Palma. Given a huge playroom and a toy box full of expensive sets props and special effects for Mission to Mars the ice-cold director of The Fury and Snake Eyes the pitiless blood-loving auteur of Carrie and Dressed to Kill embarks on his first science-fiction thriller full of dig-my-snazzy-tracking-shot braggadocio. Make-believe rocket ships and space suits have rarely looked more authentic and the weird disorientation of zero-gravity weightlessness seems right up the alley of a filmmaker who finds it terribly hard to sit still and let people experience an actual emotion or two but whos terribly interested in capturing the rhythms of havoc. Mars itself though stuns De Palma silly. And awestruck he loses his own connection to gravity. (Robert Zemeckis went deeper in Contact; Stanley Kubrick went deepest in 2001 A Space Odyssey.) In a Star Wars-worshiping kid such awkwardness is understandable. From the man who made Scarface it makes for a scrubbed trip. Mission to Mars is set in 2020 a future just near enough to taste. (The movie prides itself on being ""NASA-real""; manned landing may indeed be a reality by then although experts predict it will happen unaccompanied by the horns and timpani of Ennio Morricones bombastic score.) Astronaut Luke Graham (Don Cheadle) and his crew set off to make history by touching down on the Red Planet an assignment that should have gone to Lukes best friend Jim McConnell (Gary Sinise). But Jim is too psychologically delicate still wincing over the death of his wife and fellow astronaut Maggie (Kim Delaney). So Luke goes up while Jim watches from ground control as do colleagues Woody Blake (Tim Robbins) and his wife Terri (Connie Nielsen). Woody and Terri incidentally are the smoochingest married couple in all of NASA and wait till you see them do it weightless.... Well something goes seriously wrong on Mars. So Jim Woody Terri and utility astronaut No. 4 Phil (Jerry OConnell) take off psychologically ready or not on a recovery mission. Woody and Terri incidentally lip-locking when theyre supposed to be pulling thrusters are a setback to married couples everywhere who want to go into orbit together professionally speaking. Lukes journey to Mars is fraught with fear and danger; Woody and Jims journey to Mars is fraught with even more fear and danger. And De Palma loves danger. Cocking his point of view from one side of the frame to the other he noses in to give the sense of anxiety as well as to get close to the action when for example the rocket springs an air leak. (A frozen icicle of liquid that escapes the puncture hole and breaks off turning slowly in deep space echoes the famous tumbling-bone-to-spacecraft image in 2001.) But the actors might as well be floating frozen stiffs too. With colorless interchangeable characters uttering the generic sci-fi babble of screenwriters Jim Thomas John Thomas and Graham Yost (""Youre losing pressure Jim. We could embolize"" ""Come on people lets work the problem"" ""The universe is not chaos. Its connection. Life reaches out to life"") theres not much opportunity for any serious acting and none is required. That is if you dont count a few hard eyeball-to-eyeball stares through helmet visors as one says to another ""Listen to me goddamn it. You have to stop and you have to stop now"" Even Sinise and Cheadle two splendid performers who actually can express plenty without words -- visors and all -- are overcome by the dialogue. Mission to Mars wants us to think about lofty things the bravery of explorers the ingenuity of our nations space program the humility required to comprehend the possibility that we earthlings are not the be-all and end-all of creation. But De Palmas film is too embarrassed too jittery and self-conscious to hush up and pay attention. In the presence of profound questions the filmmaker goes profoundly shallow. And the answers ah the answers Theyre right out of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy with De Palma waving ""So long and thanks for all the fish"" Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories A Chorus Line kicks up the classics at the Hollywood Bowl Sarah Jessica Parker New HBO show isnt Sex and the City The Larry Sanders Show reruns returning to HBO this fall Stranger Things cast and fans scared with even Stranger prank HBO chief spars with critics over rape scenes Nick Cannon says he was hit with Mariah Carey diss on Wild N Out True Detective not dead yet HBO insists Photo Galleries 50Scoops50Days The Latest in Fall TV News The Biggest Moments From the 2016 Conventions Crazy Stupid Love Before They Were Stars The Most 2000s Fashion From John Tucker Must Die Exclusive Photos of The Walking Dead Season 7 27 Great Revenge Movies Alice in Wonderland Witticisms and Wisdom From the Disney Classic From Our Partners From Our Partners Contact UsCustomer ServiceAbout UsJobs at Time Inc.AdvertisePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAd ChoicesNewslettersSubscribeTerms of ServiceSite Map Copyright (c) 2016 Entertainment Weekly Inc.
