Instead of a global threat that threatens the globe the beclawed Logan must solve a Big Sleep-style mystery set in Japan. Theres even a cleverish play on the world-weary detective our nearly immortal hero is so world-weary that he flirts with death (embodied by his dead lover Jean Grey). Theres even some talk of what makes life meaningful But remember how The Big Sleep was ridiculously overstuffed needlessly complicated and redundantly repetitive to the point of near-silliness? Yeah here too. And star Hugh Jackman while he does get many chances to display his remarkable physique doesnt get much to compare with Bogeys dialogue. Also disappointing Japan seems valued more for its scenery and costumes than anything having to do with its character. Oh well - well always have action scenes.

"Claws and All Hugh Jackman Gets Ripped for The Wolverine and Cate Blanchett Outdoes Herself for Woody Allen << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Claws and All Hugh Jackman Gets Ripped for The Wolverine and Cate Blanchett Outdoes Herself for Woody Allen 20th Century Fox Hugh Jackman July 26 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print In The Wolverine Hugh Jackman takes the live-action superhero body to a disturbing new place. And no its not the gym. Well its not only the gym. Most of the movie is him in and out of a white tank top his arms and shoulders abubble and athrob the veins flowing with god knows what. His body is beyond fitness beyond fat beyond muscles beyond ready comprehension. It is beyond the human body as the movies have previously depicted it. Ive never seen anything like this and Ive seen John Travolta in Staying Alive Demi Moore in G.I. Jane and Sylvester Stallone in everything. Jackman surpasses what theyve done. Yes he seems performance-enhanced and computer-generated. But his body appears to be ... acting. The film taken from the Marvel Comics X-Men universe opens minutes before the U.S. drops an atomic bomb on Nagasaki in 1945 and flambes Jackmans character a clawed indestructible loner with one name (Logan) and one mood (""argh""). He stands at the bottom of a well rendered a tower of bloody tissue by the bomb. For an audience watching him in that state is not unlike being a toddler who falls and needs 35 seconds to figure out whether to cry. I found the sight of him funny. The whites of his eyes are the only solid color on his face and when he blinks I laughed. But in the seconds before his hair and skin regenerate the actual horror of the image sets in. Thats such a hauntingly terrible sight that the movie could have ended there but it goes on for two competent hours (the director is James Mangold who did Walk the Line and that very entertaining remake of 310 to Yuma). Logan is summoned back to present-day Japan. The soldier (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) whose life he saved that day in Nagasaki is now an old technology magnate interested in Logans strength imperviousness and eternal middle age. Most of the characters are Japanese. Logans sidekick Yukio (Rila Fukushima) an assassin who works for the magnate has hair the color of some nail polishes and a face shaped like an arrowhead. She might be the most Marvel-ready actress Ive ever seen. The magnates granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) is engaged oft-imperiled and causes romantic stirrings in Logan. A Hollywood blockbuster with even superficial interest in an actual non-outer-space culture is not insignificant even if that culture happens to be the worlds no. 1 consumer of American movies. Still getting Logan to the movies above-average finale required three writers -- Christopher McQuarrie Mark Bomback and Scott Frank -- to pad the plot. A lot of that padding necessitates fights and foot chases with yakuza and ninja and dreams about the guilt he feels for killing his fellow X-Person Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who speaks to him between the sheets like the girlfriend in some bad music videos. At some point Logan is poisoned by the magnates doctor -- the toxin-spewing mutant Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) -- leaving him far more mortal. The nasty scheme she hopes to help realize should last less than 15 minutes after she strikes but the movie drags on long after that too. The X-Men series was always vast and interesting enough to lend itself to good and good-enough movies. The moments of quiet in this one are a vast improvement over the nonstop bellicosity in 2009s X-Men Origins Wolverine. They suggest Mangolds characteristic patience and confidence in both the material and the marketplaces tolerance for a superhero doing a lot of sitting around. The Wolverine comes from a 1982 quartet of issues written by Chris Claremont and drawn by Frank Miller. Theyre beautiful but they deviated so far from what as a kid I loved about the X-Men which was namely the X-Men themselves. I also think I was too young to feel safe with a character whos essentially an asshole. Seven years old might be too young for the nuances of antiheroism. Im not sure this new movie was even necessary except to whet appetites for next years X-Men Days of Future Past. But if Marvel is giving the X-Men the Avengers treatment its disappointing that the studio hasnt taken more demographic risks with its lead-ins to the enormous reunion event. Why not build something entirely around Jean Grey and her personae or Halle Berrys Storm or Anna Paquins Rogue or Ellen Pages barely used Kitty Pryde who shared a Claremont series with Wolverine? If we can survive two Hulk movies and one Thor (with another on the way) I think were ready for a woman who can walk through walls. In the meantime theres Jackman. He has pumped himself all the way up after having worked himself down to nothing to bench press the show tunes in Les Miserables. Jackman placed a similar stress on the characters body in the previous movie. But this time theres no glory in any of it. Theres no sexiness either. All Jackman does here is strain and grunt and suffer. You rarely see an actor work this hard just to express more work but hes made a complete surrender to the exercise of exercise. When Travolta danced in his loincloth (under Stallones direction too) it was vanity. When Moore shaved her head and did one-arm push-ups it was politics. With Jackman its neither. Whether hes cutting open his chest and feeling around for his heart pretending to slice into the roof of a speeding train or holding on to grating that overlooks a cliff Jackman is giving us the camp of martyrdom. His charisma has gone to his biceps and his chest and his delts and his abs. Its not sweat thats pouring out of those muscles. Its The Messiah. Loving Woody Allen can be as wearying as hating him. He never stays good (or bad) for long. But lately when hes good hes wonderful and during this decade-long run of post-New York wanderlust Ive found him to be truly wonderful twice -- and Im neither a Match Point person (heartless pointless unconvincing) nor a Midnight in Paris person (pyrite Allen but its popularity was a reassurance that we still cared). For me Cassandras Dream from 2008 is the moral thriller people thought they were getting with Match Point. It was free of the cultural tourism and the backhanded judgment of his other European films. He wrote a tight dark movie about two striving English brothers (Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell) and a boat. The further south their scheme goes the more comfortable Allen seems to feel drawing out the suspense and quietly pushing some notion of masculine weakness. Vaguely it was like Hitchcock. But really it was closer to wherever Allen was when he made his last full masterpiece Crimes and Misdemeanors. His new film Blue Jasmine is the other thing of wonder. What youre looking for with him are signs of life as opposed to shtick and koans and characters screaming at each other. You want to see that the finery of character writing still means something to him. This is his 43rd movie and its inspired. He sends a fallen New York socialite named Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) from Manhattan to San Francisco to live with her grocery-store-clerk sister Ginger (Sally Hawkins). They were adopted and a corruption scandal schemed by Jasmines ex-husband Hal (Alec Baldwin) has left them estranged and broke. Arriving west Jasmine doesnt seem to know where she is. Even when shes talking a mile a minute she seems someplace else. But shes never far away enough to resist leaving whatever she looks at or whomever she undermines covered in a comical ooze of hauteur. Shes the kind of woman who can make a mobile phone call on the street and turn to her cab driver to say ""Can I have some privacy please?"" Ginger and her husband Augie (Andrew Dice Clay) invested a lottery windfall with Hal. Losing it cost them a lot of money and their marriage. But Ginger is flighty and decent. If she holds a grudge its well out of sight. Jasmine needs her and you get the sense that even though Jasmine appears to openly despise Gingers well-lived-in Mission District apartment and the two sons with whom she shares it Ginger is also happy to be needed. Jasmines life in New York is told in flashbacks and the film is almost evenly split between the two sisters and their men for Jasmine Baldwin a presumptuous Michael Stuhlbarg and Peter Sarsgaard; for Ginger its Louis C.K. Bobby Cannavale and Clay who has blunted his crassness with gloom. Theres also a small fiery part for Alden Ehrenreich as Hal and Jasmines son. Allens writing is mostly sharp and natural enough for the emotional stakes to be clear. Really much of his achievement is finding a new vintage influence to give him a shot in the arm. This time its Tennessee Williamss A Streetcar Named Desire with Jasmine as the domineering psychologically brittle Blanche DuBois and Ginger as the compliant Stella. Now theres some great theatrical nuance in the filmmaking. In one of the flashbacks Ginger and Augie have gone to visit an instantly exasperated Jasmine and Hal in their Upper East Side palace. They go back to their hotel and gossip about a party Jasmine took them to. Augie claims that a woman who flirted with Hal also flirted with him. No one would want you she says only me. He doesnt fly into a rage. He just absorbs her playfulness and as the conversation continues they get sensually close to each other. Its the sort of scene that pops up in many an Allen movie -- the bedtime recap. But here it feels dangerous and a little hot. I dont know that he could have written a scene this sort of good and imbued it with such heat without thinking about Williams. The cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobes intense warmth and handsome vistas free Blue Jasmines riff on Streetcar from the iconic black-and-white of Elia Kazans film. Theres some nonsense here mostly involving Stuhlbarg as a randy dentist and Allen persists with his enthusiasm for blue-collar ethnics and working women as a kind of science fiction. But Allens not out to mock Williamss hot-bloodedness. He wants to sip on it. Ginger for instance is a Stella who cant stop looking for Stanleys. C.K. Clay and Cannavale are all doing variations on the same macho man Cannavales being the most elastic. The writing isnt that great for Ginger. She comes off as a drunk in a Mike Leigh movie. Hawkins figures prominently in Cassandras Dream and is best known for the human stimulant/irritant she played with astonishing zeal in Leighs Happy-Go-Lucky. Here the weariness in her face and the mousiness in her voice are Stella by way of Talia Shire in Rocky. She does everything right but the movie is almost meant to belong to Blanchett. Allen has set most of the film on her face and within her hopped-up motormouth diction. The year thus far has been short on great performances. Blanchetts belongs to a sadly exclusive club. Shes played Blanche DuBois on the stage. For Allen she turns the character from a Southern belle into a Stockard Channing in Six Degrees of Separation. But its not snobbery she playing. Its displacement. The separation is from reality. Allen makes use of Blanchetts statuesqueness. In Gingers apartment at that dentists office in a taxicab on the glamourless sidewalks of the Mission Jasmine seems to be in the wrong Wonderland. Blue Jasmine is the searching Allen of Another Woman and Alice and Jasmine is almost the sort of scornful id that Judy Davis was so good at playing for him. But where Davis came at the comedy with bile and Mia Farrow in Alice with whimsy Blanchett is going for something unstable but secret. When Jasmine recalls the humiliation of a friend catching her working at a Manhattan shoe store and sneaking out she goes hard and delirious ""I saw you Erica Bishop"" Allen has always written good parts for women. This is one of the few to seem made of magic. You actually get the sense that Allen has let Blanchett go off on some kind of adventure that he planted a seed and this is the wildflower that grew.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 26 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 26 2013 952AM EDT Comments AA Directed by James Mangold Written by Mark Bomback Scott Frank Christopher McQuarrie Starring Hugh Jackman Tao Okamoto Hal Yamanouchi Classification PG Genre action Year 2013 Country USA Language English When the claw-knuckled mutant known as Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is summoned from semi-feral self-exile in the Yukon by an emissary of Yashida the dying Japanese billionaire he once saved from atomic obliteration in Nagasaki (Hal Yamanouchi) the darndest thing happens A movie actually concerned with plot and character ensues. And there are no giant robots involved until The Wolverine reaches its disappointingly ordinary end. Until that point however director James Mangold - shooting a script penned by Mark Bomback Scott Frank and Christopher McQuarrie - fashions the unlikeliest of summer superhero movies. It restores the tarnished lustre to this most fan-beloved of Marvel characters by doing precisely what Chris Claremont and Frank Millers near-sacred 1982 run did It pumps some feeling into the guy along with his muscles and steel talons and puts him in situations where actual drama occurs.For those unacquainted with The Wolverine or with the X-Men universe from which he pounced our hero is an ageless and pained immortal haunted by his past and longing for mortality. Thats why Yashidas offer of death to Logan (Wolverines credit-card name) is so tempting. But then some monks dispense with robes and start firing randomly into the crowd at Yashidas funeral. Turns out the old mans family may be the target of intense yakuza aggression and Wolverine his powers depleted by sinister intervention must spend the rest of the movie trying to protect Yashidas daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) from all manner of assaults. But it gives him something to live for.Mangold (310 to Yuma Walk the Line) a director better known for muscular dramatics than muscular mutants is clearly aiming for a more down-to-earth superhero movie with The Wolverine especially compared with the knuckleheaded X-Men Origins Wolverine (2009). He nearly succeeds at least insofar as replanting the character in a plot that falls closely into the tradition of such endangered gaijin thrillers as House of Bamboo The Yakuza and even the Bond-in-Japan You Only Live Twice. While the movies surplus of ninjas samurai swords and yakuza thugs is a little thick for cultural credibility in this universe it certainly beats morphing mutants for novelty.Out of his element and lost in translation Wolverine is charismatically incarnated by Jackman in the actors sixth kick at the claws. He character is forced to deal with situations that come without warning and at ferocious velocity never more so than in a sequence atop a speeding bullet train thats as thrilling as any fight sequence this side of the Bourne trilogy.Id wager in fact that Mangold spent more time watching those movies than the previous five X-Men movies for The Wolverine truly plays more as a hyperkinetic close-quarter multinational action thriller than as a CGI-driven comic spectacular. At least until that giant robot shows up which feels more like an intrusion by commercial pressure than an attack by Wolverines natural predators.Whether or not this flies in the unforgiving fan world remains to be seen. But for those less intemperately invested The Wolverine will come as a welcome and bracing surprise An almost human-scaled superhero movie about a guy who goes to die in Japan and ends up beating his way back to life.

Partly thats the way the guys written lovesick and scraping his way to multiple disembowelments. But at least give these screenwriters and director James Mangold (Walk the Line) credit for putting the angst front and center Early on we see an especially hairy Logan (Jackman) wandering the woods in a grizzly-man funk lashing out at a tree for no apparent reason and having violent dreams about his lost lady Jean (Famke Janssen). These kinds of movies require that he straighten up and fly right; for a while though you can pretend that Jackman is trapped in outtakes from Les Miserables and about to break into song. Somewhat laughably he encounters pixie-cute Yukio (Rila Fukushima) in a dive bar and she shuttles him off to Tokyo where a Japanese business magnate lies dying. Heres where the intrigue is supposed to happen (Logan once shared a bunker with this oldster when the A-bomb dropped on Nagasaki) and theres a sultry appealingly confident granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) who needs protecting from greedy interests. But too quickly the random fights pile up--so many yakuza thugs who forgot to wear chain mail that morning--and you yearn for the film that might have been. It exists in fits and starts a Blade Runner-esque moment of rainy contemplation on a hotel balcony; some weird sexual tension with a lizard girl (statuesque Svetlana Khodchenkova) who steals away Wolverines healing powers. (Get your comics-geek friends to fill in the gaps.) To the end Jackman aims higher than the material even as its busyness feels like a foregone conclusion. Its You Only Live Twice without the Nancy Sinatra song--Hugh could have killed that.

Directed by James Mangold ""Wolverine"" is as much an homage to Asian martial arts movies as it is a Marvel Comics spinoff. (The two domains are not all that far apart.) Hugh Jackmans Wolverine/Logan trying to douse his inner beast has been secluding himself in the Yukon wilds. But of course the big bad world keeps pulling him back - this time all the way to Tokyo where he finds himself embroiled in family clan wars.Worse one of the resident nasties (she is literally viperish) has found a way to drain Wolverine/Logan of his recuperative powers. All of this makes him more vulnerable - i.e. interesting - than before. At least now we know he can be killed.Dewy corporate heiress Mariko (Tao Okamoto) provides the sappy love interest. Hes better matched albeit platonically with the pixieish red-velvet-haired Yukio (Rila Fukushima) a whirlwind of martial arts moves. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Mangold front-loads the action but a first-rate fight atop a bullet train between Wolverine/Logan and some especially pesky ninjas puts the train fights in the recent ""The Lone Ranger"" to shame.

The Wolverine (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Wolverine (PG-13) Hugh Jackmans second solo outing as the clawed mutant is set in a foreign and dangerous land. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com7/25/2013 Editor rating 3 Just as comic-book movie fatigue was starting to set in along comes The Wolverine to revive a moribund summer of superheroes. There was no reason to expect much from Hugh Jackmans sixth reprisal of the clawed mutant Logan His previous solo outing (X-Men Origins Wolverine) was cartoonish in all the worst ways and production on this follow-up stalled for more than a year after various directors circled then left the project. James Mangold (Walk the Line) ended up with the gig but his previous attempt at an action picture (the disastrous Knight and Day) made him a curious choice to take over one of Marvel Comics most iconic characters. But Mangold turns out to have been a perfect choice since The Wolverine which was inspired by the famed story arc from the comic-book miniseries written by Chris Claremont and drawn by Frank Miller is much more of a character piece than usual for the genre. The story picks up directly after the end of 2006s X-Men The Last Stand in which the hero was forced to kill his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) in order to save the world. The X-Men have disbanded and Wolverine has pulled a Grizzly Adams and retreated to the wilderness to mourn his loss. Then an acquaintance from his past beckons from Japan so he travels overseas for a face-to-face. The stranger-in-a-strange-land setting immediately distinguishes The Wolverine from all other comic-book pictures ploppling the protagonist in the middle of a complicated power struggle involving three generations of a wealthy family. There are cultural barriers Logan must learn to navigate and there are customs and rituals that go directly against his savage animalistic instincts. Ninjas samurais and yakuza are all part of the mix along with a mysterious blond (Svetlana Khodchenkova) who may be a fellow mutant in disguise. The movie has several big setpieces including a prolonged fight atop a bullet train hurtling at 300 miles per hour that is furiously exciting and another confrontation against enemies wielding bows and arrows that is strongly evocative of Akira Kurosawa. The picture forces its hero to learn new ways of defending himself and ups the stakes by robbing him of his ability to heal himself rendering him more vulnerable than ever before. The action in The Wolverine is so well choreographed and cut together it leaves you thinking Mangold was simply off his game when he made Knight and Day. But the script which was co-written by Scott Frank (Out of Sight Get Shorty) has been carefully designed to engage you on a purely narrative level too something this genre often neglects. There is a multitude of characters surrounding Logan whose true intentions are gradually revealed The red-haired Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who looks like a living anime character and offers to serve as his bodyguard; the suicidal Mariko (Tao Okamoto) who is oppressed by her abusive father and is being forced to marry a politician; and her former flame Harada (Will Yun Lee) who has sworn to protect Marikos life even if hes not allowed to have much contact with her. In most superhero movies this sort of stuff often plays like filler to pass the time between bursts of special effects. But in The Wolverine the filmmakers take the time to allow you to invest in these characters which makes the bursts of action all the more thrilling. Even though the movie resorts to comic-book cliches for the big climax The Wolverine still feels like a refreshing change of pace. Even the requisite mid-end credits stinger is terrific causing a preview audience to burst out with loud cheers and applause. The post-conversion 3D is more distracting than anything else but the rest of this surprisingly fun entertainment is as sharp as the heros claws.

Hugh Jackman is still great as The Wolverine review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesHugh Jackman is still great as The Wolverine reviewIts better than X-Men Origins Wolverine but not as good as Hugh Jackmans portrayal of character.At its best The Wolverine is a superhero/Asian crime drama mash-up with Hugh Jackmans Logan fighting ninjas and samurai.  (BEN ROTHSTEIN / 20TH CENTURY FOX)  By Raju MudharTech ReporterFri. July 26 2013The WolverineStarring Hugh Jackman Tao Okamoto Rila Fukushima Famke Janssen. Directed by James Mangold. 107 minutes. At major theatres. PGWolverineTheWolverine unspools as a superhero take on The Bodyguard mixed with The Karate Kid 2 which sounds awful but actually works fairly well for its first two acts. Then it remembers its supposed to be a comic book movie and decides to go out in a biff-bam-pow of an overblown mess of a climax. It is the Wolverine characters second solo outing and it benefits from being a self-contained smaller story easily better than X-Men Origins Wolverine which has been disavowed by most fans as an overstuffed travesty that somehow also managed to screw up Deadpool another one of Marvels most beloved characters.Article Continued BelowFan anticipation has been high as the creators went back to the drawing board and set The Wolverine in Japan loosely based on the classic Chris Claremont/Frank Miller miniseries from 1982 that helped define the character in the first place. Early on there is a great take on that series opening panels where Logan a.k.a. Wolverine tracks down some hunters. Superhero movies have become live-action remixes of the comic source material and its good that this isnt a slavish retelling of the original story and adds fresh elements for diehard fans who know the story well. Comic films also borrow from others and there are shades of The Dark Knight Rises here. As the movie begins Wolverine has become a pacifist living in the woods overwrought by the loss of Jean Grey. He is summoned to Japan by a reclusive tech billionaire named Yashida whose life he saved in the Second World War but it is Yashidas granddaughter and chosen heir Mariko who Wolvie has to protect for the bulk of the film. The film often feels like Wolverine versus every futuristic and anachronistic Japanese stereotype you can think of with ninjas samurai and a pretty good fight on a bullet train but its a credit to the production team that these elements somehow work with the movie at its best as a superhero/Asian crime drama mash-up. Wolverine has always worked best when he is an outsider and the setting helps establish that. Hugh Jackman remains great in the role grimly underplaying quips and believable as a hero tortured by loss. It makes you wish that someday a filmmaker could make a film worthy of his portrayal of the character. This movie is not there yet but hes clearly not the problem. The female performances are fine. The roles are not particularly strong but there are plenty of them with Famke Janssen reprising her Jean Grey role Rila Fukushima as Yukio Tao Okamoto holding her own as love interest Mariko and Svetlana Khodchenkova as the villain Viper. The movies quiet middle is probably one of the most surprising things about a superhero film in recent memory and there is a somewhat believable relationship that might let this pass as a decent enough date film. The movie was clearly a late conversion to 3D so there is no reason to pay extra for the glasses. Director James Mangold (Knight and Day 310 to Yuma) does a good job with the quieter character moments although he shoots some of the fight sequences too tightly with many blending into a violent sameness. This bigger issue is that all of the films elements dont come together as a whole its not entirely sure if it wants to be a small story of a hero finding himself and his purpose or a bombastic film about one of comics most beloved characters. As it stands there is enough here for most fans and an enjoyable enough film for the casual viewer but as with most summer action fare both groups should do themselves a favour and not invest much brainpower in it. It may go without saying but stick around for the post-credit scene that manages to put this solo tale back into the larger X-film continuity setting up next years X-Men Days of Future Past.

Jean Valjean with retractable adamantium claws Logan belting out ""Suddenly"" More about The Wolverine >> Alas it is not to be. But The Wolverine James Mangolds dark and stormy and ragingly fun X-Men thriller could be the next best thing. Instead of starving threadbare throngs of 19th-century French folk we get the whooshing ninjas tattooed yakuza and anime cool of 21st-century Japan. And Jackman ripped and brooding gets hurled into a Shakespearean whirlpool of power plays and family intrigue with bullet trains pachinko parlors and noodle soups thrown into the mix. But first to the Yukon Whos this shaggy mountain man his beard thick and matted like a nest? He huddles over a fire drinking whiskey the night sky overhead. Hes a forgotten man a hermit. In the opening scenes of The Wolverine Jackmans Logan is one gloomy Gus hiding in the outback licking his spiritual wounds. He could use a bath a haircut a shave. A manicure? Nah better not. It doesnt take long though for Logans anger-management issues to upend his off-the-grid plans. A gang of hunters kill his only friend - a big grizzly bear (the two of em liked to go skulking together through the woods). So Logan tromps down the hill to town finds the culprits in a saloon and sets out to teach them a lesson. Enter a punky girl wielding a samurai sword showing off her martial-arts skills and insisting that the muscular mutant accompany her back to Tokyo. Which is where they and The Wolverine go. She is Yukio (the tiny twinkling Rila Fukushima) dispatched by a Japanese industrialist to find Logan and bring him to his home. The men share a rather apocalyptic history and have some serious catching up to do. Logan then becomes the Ugly American the stranger in a strange land completely out of his comfort zone. (And yes some kimono-clad housemaids insist he take a bath.) While 2009s X-Men Origins Wolverine showed us the Marvel Comics superheros powers of self-healing and immortality in The Wolverine Logan - after an encounter with a sexy oncologist (Svetlana Khodchenkova) - finds that suddenly those bullets and blade wounds are beginning to hurt. A couple of rounds of fisticuffs and hes achy bleeding hobbling around with a limp. What gives? Although The Wolverine eventually falls back on a comic-book formula and CG effects (the climactic face-off between Logan and a giant silver warriorlike thing is totally generic) Mangold and his team find time to explore more nuanced realms as Logan becomes the protector then lover of Mariko (Tao Okamoto) the beautiful granddaughter of the man who summoned Logan to Japan. When the couple go on the run from a gangster horde they hide out in a ""love hotel"" - opting for the Mission to Mars room over the one with the nurses-office decor. The Wolverine can be funny too. Apart from Khodchenkova who displays the acting acumen of a runway model and gives new meaning to the term Russian mole (shes the villainous vixen of the tale suited up in high heels and slinky scaly couture) the cast of The Wolverine is uniformly good. Well Famke Janssen - as the gauzy ghost of Jean Grey Logans X-Men teammate and soulmate - doesnt have much to do but look dreamily seductive. The Asian cast however is kicking - including the aforementioned Fukushima as Logans impish self-appointed bodyguard; Okamoto as Logans elegant new amour and Haruhiko Yamanouchi as the powerful patriarch. On top of all that The Wolverine explains why you should never leave your chopsticks sticking up in a bowl of rice. Good to know. The Wolverine  (out of four stars) Directed by James Mangold.

Ben Rothstein/Fox The Wolverine Director James Mangold Genre Action Running Time 126 minutes Rated PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence some sexuality and language With Hugh Jackman Tao Okamoto Rila Fukushima Wait where are the falling buildings? Why is it that life on earth as we know it isnt in peril? Doesnt director James Mangold know that Summer 2013 is all-apocalypse all the time when it comes to blockbusters? Yet heres The Wolverine the sixth film in the X-Men franchise in which only a handful of the good guys are ever in any real danger and if evil wins out ... well it would be spoiling things to give too many details so suffice it to say that if evil wins the day the only media outlets covering it would be the likes of the Financial Times. The Wolverine is that rare (and growing rarer) breed the intimate super-hero movie a story thats all about isolating our genetically mutated hero -- Hugh Jackmans Logan/Wolverine -- and making him think and talk about his feelings. Sure he gets to punch faces and use those adamantium claws to slash some jugulars (remarkably bloodlessly -- this is PG-13 jugular-slashing) but he doesnt feel too great about it. i Svetlana Khodchenkovas villainous Viper adds to Wolverines thoroughly respectable tally of Ladies To Be Reckoned With even if the character ultimately feels pretty thinly drawn. Ben Rothstein/Fox hide caption toggle caption Ben Rothstein/Fox Svetlana Khodchenkovas villainous Viper adds to Wolverines thoroughly respectable tally of Ladies To Be Reckoned With even if the character ultimately feels pretty thinly drawn. Ben Rothstein/Fox Hes got some heavy past trauma hes trying to work through - if youve forgotten what happened at the end of 2006s much-maligned X-Men The Last Stand you may want to brush up as Mangold doesnt bother with recapping. Logan is a loner now generally more at home in a caveside camp communing with grizzlies. Though when Mariko (Tao Okamoto) an attractive Japanese heiress and granddaughter of an old friend is in danger he can be pretty comfy in a cozy Japanese bayside cottage learning the customary way to eat with chopsticks. Id like to credit Mangold along with writers Christopher McQuarrie Mark Bomback and Scott Frank for their good intentions; the smaller scope and lighter tone of their film is a tonic after bloated doom and gloom of Man of Steel. Prominent roles for women -- as strong partners as warriors and as villains not just as damsels in distress also make for a nice change of pace. And in setting most of the film in Japan -- to which Logan has been summoned by that old friend (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) who he saved from certain death at Nagasaki in 1945 -- Mangold opens the door to influences from martial arts cinema to yakuza films to Wong Kar-Wais Chungking Express. Yet none of those great ideas are particularly well executed. The films intimate psychological explorations of what it means to be invincible are probably its strongest aspects as Logan much like Kal-El in 1980s Superman II loses his most important powers -- the mutation technically that allows him to heal immediately from even the most gruesome injuries -- and is thereby rendered something closer to human. But the device is hampered somewhat by its inconsistent ill-defined and suspiciously convenient application. Its never clear just how ""mortal"" Logan has become; he still seems pretty resilient when it counts and some wounds notably those at his knuckles where his claws extend heal immediately even as bullet holes continue to bleed. Mariko and her adoptive sister Yukio (Rila Fukushima) are strong female presences -- Mariko does need some saving but she also doesnt let Logan get away with his emotionally scarred little-boy routine. Yukio meanwhile is very much presented as Logans warrior equal and you can count on her to become an X-Men franchise regular. But the female villain Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) is flimsier than the slinky dress she wears through most of the climactic battle. Shes barely drawn well enough to be a tertiary henchman let alone something close to the movies archvillain. Most disappointingly the Japanese-cinema influences are never really fully explored. While reference is made to Logans similarity to a ronin a samurai without a master the film never really plays on the moody isolation suggested by that designation. The martial-arts sequences meanwhile are more comprehensible than is the norm for modern action but theyre mostly forgettable apart from a truly breathtaking fight atop a speeding bullet train. Thats pretty much what we get with The Wolverine a handful of bold ideas brought down by the need to regress to a blander more box-office-friendly middle ground. Id like to see what a real Wolverine-as-samurai film looks like or a superheros tragic romance or even just his struggle with the one thing he lacks mortality. Instead The Wolverine pays lip service to its more intriguing notions before winding things up with a chaotic finale that feels just like the bigger faster crazier end of every other comic-book movie -- only thankfully with less city-wide demolition. Correction July 30 2013 This review initially misidentified the actor playing Logans industrial-titan friend Yashida. He is Haruhiko Yamanouchi.

Think Tony Starks PTSD symptoms in Iron Man 3 Supermans identity crisis in Man of Steel and now the angst-ridden momentarily declawed tough guy at the heart of The Wolverine the second solo venture for The X-Mens angry id in a mere four years.Sometimes the gambit works. Just dont confuse turgid storytelling and minimal action with intelligence. Set mostly in Japan -- hello international market -- The Wolverine represents a strain of faux gravitas that squeezes nearly all the fun out of blockbuster moviemaking. Here we have multimillion-dollar proof that slow and unsure can be just as dull as hyperkinetic chaos.Hugh Jackman is back as Logan grieving over the loss of his beloved Jean Gray (played by Famke Janssen in Logans tortured flashbacks) and suffering down to the marrow of his adamantium innards. Hes let himself go up in the Yukon sprouting a look that might befit a Metallica roadie and befriending the local grizzly bear population.Then a magenta-haired Japanese lass (Rila Fukushima) whisks him off to Tokyo to bid farewell to an aging World War II acquaintance from Nagasaki. Weve met him as well in an economical flashback prologue that includes the famed atomic bomb blast. Now he wants what our Wolverine has and loathes immortality.Its not a bad premise but it doesnt take long for The Wolverine to become a jumble of haggard plot turns and pained emotional exchanges involving characters we come nowhere close to knowing. The movie doesnt have a story so much as a series of maneuvers punctuated by the occasional and very welcome ninja attack.Jackman glowers and squints through a sort-of romance with a late tech titans daughter (Tao Okamoto) and squints some more when he realizes his powers of recovery have ebbed. An ice-blond femme fatale mutant (Svetlana Khodchenkova) slinks around doing mischief in the name of uh something or other. Plot clarity is not a strong point of The Wolverine.Neither is excitement. After the screening a friend referred to The Wolverine as a ""thinking mans superhero movie"" as if lack of action somehow automatically equates to brain food. Its certainly possible to smuggle real ideas into comic-book fare; actually the first two X-Men movies from 2000 and 2003 did so with instinctive grace. Those movies and to some extent 2011s reboot X-Men First Class grew outward from the question of what it means to be different or more to the point a mutant.The Wolverine is at its best when it remembers to be fun as in an early improbable knife-to-knife combat sequence atop a speeding bullet train. Its a ridiculous scene pulled off with balletic wit the kind of thing sorely lacking in the rest of the movie.In straining for seriousness The Wolverine somehow manages to extract all the pulp. Thats the one ingredient a comic book needs most.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.THE WOLVERINEC- Directed by James Mangold.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Correction An earlier version of this article misstated the setting of the film ""Pacific Rim."" ""The Wolverine"" takes Logan (Hugh Jackman) to Japan where he crosses paths with ninjas samurai and assorted gun-toting neer-do-wells. (Ben Rothstein) By Michael OSullivan July 25 2013 A refreshing summer cocktail of action-movie staples ""The Wolverine"" combines the bracingly adult flavor of everyones favorite mutant antihero -- tortured boozy X-Man Logan a.k.a. Wolverine -- with the fizzy effervescence of several mixers from the cabinet of Japanese genre cinema noirish yakuza crime drama samurai derring-do and ninja acrobatics. It goes down super smooth but packs a punch erasing not only the memory of Marvels last foray into the Wolverine mythos the 2009 stinker ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" but also washing away the more recent unpleasant aftertaste of this summers other Asian-set action thriller ""Pacific Rim."" Its proof that you just cant kill Wolverine. But Lord how this movie tries. After a brief prologue the film opens on the titular hero (Hugh Jackman) who is now a virtually homeless alcoholic living in a squalid encampment in the woods where hes plagued by nightmares starring his late lady love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Fans of the ""X-Men"" series of movies will recall that Logan was forced to kill Jean at the end of the final chapter of the ""X-Men"" trilogy 2006s ""The Last Stand."" In short order however our hero is on his way to Tokyo escorted by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) a magenta-haired Harajuku girl whose powers of persuasion are enhanced by her skill with a samurai sword. A mutant with the ability to foretell peoples deaths shes a great character hinting at a soul as dark as Logans. My one complaint is that the film doesnt do more with her; she and Logan are kindred spirits. Yukio has been sent to retrieve Logan on behalf of her elderly patron Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) who is dying. As we learn in the prologue Logan was once a World War II prisoner outside Nagasaki Japan where he saved Yashidas life after the atomic bomb was dropped. (Yes Logan is capable of surviving a nuclear blast. If you have a problem with the physics of that you might as well stop reading now.) Yashida it seems wants to say more than goodbye and thank you to his old friend. He has summoned Logan to take advantage of his healing powers whether the world-weary mutant is ready to relinquish them or not. That theme -- that Logans immortality is both a blessing and a curse and that Logan might actually welcome death -- has been explored before especially in the ""Origins"" film. There it was flogged to numbing effect. Here its a garnish that doesnt get in the way of the fun. Fun of course is subjective. It may be a bit of a cliche but Yashidas family has both violent mob connections and a long history of association with ninjas embodied by Harada (Will Yun Lee) a bodyguard who wields a bow and arrow like Legolas. When Yashidas granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) is abducted by gunmen Logans nihilistic instincts are overridden by his heroic ones and he becomes the young womans protector and lover. One of the films great set pieces is a fight between Logan and a knife-carrying Japanese thug thats staged atop a speeding bullet train carrying Mariko. The choreography is terrific if patently absurd as they duck and flip in order to avoid getting slashed or bashed in the head by passing signs. Logan meanwhile after a fleeting encounter with Yashidas femme-fatale doctor (Svetlana Khodchenkova) finds his recuperative abilities increasingly compromised. Trust me its all a lot less complicated than it sounds. Where ""The Wolverine"" delivers isnt in plot but in its core dynamic which places Logan in the familiar if somewhat paternalistic role of savior. Thats a welcome change from ""Origins"" in which his primary motivation was ugly revenge. Its perhaps fitting that his character here when we first encounter him in the woods all bearded and long-haired looks a bit like Jesus Christ. Its symbolism thats driven home by all the bullet wounds that he sustains and which no longer instantaneously heal leaving bloody stigmata. Could the theme of martyrdom be any more obvious? But forget all that. Theres nothing particularly heavy about ""The Wolverine."" That is other than a suit of souped-up samurai armor thats made of the same indestructible metal as Wolverines retractable claws. Surely youve seen the image on all the bus-shelter ads? No? Then youre clearly not paying attention. Everyone else who has been will not be disappointed least of all by the closing-credits teaser. For the love of all that is mutant youll want to stay for a glimpse of what promises to be not only a deeply satisfying resurrection of the Wolverine but also certain other beloved characters in next years ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" 1/2 PG-13.

Grade B As the hero unleashes his half-dozen metal claws it becomes clear that ""The Wolverine"" is six slashes above the summers other superhero movies. It has a more absorbing story and intriguing sensibility than ""Iron Man 3"" or ""Man of Steel"" and even when its action falters this film is more original and exotic. Yes the movie provides the usual overblown pyrotechnics but it also has the audacity to start off with a real-world big bang - the A-bomb explosion at Nagasaki. Wolverine aka Logan (Hugh Jackman) is ""in the hole"" at a POW camp across the harbor from the island city when the B-29s approach carrying the bomb. Since Logans super-healing powers allow him to recover from radiation burns hes able to shield a Japanese guard with his own body. Decades later the guard now a towering industrialist makes a deathbed request that brings Wolverine to Tokyo. This tycoon has funded technology that could enable him to live forever. The one thing he needs is Logans permission to siphon off the mutants ability to heal. That appeal sets in motion a plot filled with black-clad ninja soldiers tattooed yakuza thugs poisonous family and business relationships - and outlandish poisons supplied by a coiling super-villain named Viper. ""The Wolverine"" was inspired by the 1982 Chris Claremont-Frank Miller comic that was more simply called ""Wolverine."" (The films Canadian Yukon prelude comes out of Claremont and Millers limited series.) The movie though often plays like a welcome remake of the James Bond film ""You Only Live Twice"" down to the lighthearted scene of the burly hero getting scrubbed in a Japanese tub. Director James Mangold knows theres something inherently funny and moving about a hirsute hulking hero navigating a refined culture. This movie needs all the culture-clash laughs and poignancy Mangold can find because Logan spends much of it in a funk. Hes still brooding over killing his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) when she got out of control in ""X-Men The Last Stand"" (2006). She comes to the angst-ridden man in his dreams looking great in glamorous white lighting and guilt-tripping him like a shoulder angel and a shoulder devil rolled into one. Whats worse before the action reaches a boiling point the Viper suppresses Wolverines powers - Logan gets physically hurt and feels pain. Jackman throws himself so fully into all this agony that his skull and facial muscles enter gridlock. You worry that hell freeze into a permanent glower. At times he resembles Phil Hartmans Frankenstein on ""Saturday Night Live"" without the gnarly humor. Luckily Rila Fukushima as the tycoons feisty ward Yukio and Tao Okamoto as his lissome granddaughter (they think of each other as sisters) bring Logan out of his self-loathing self. They also give the film a one-two punch. With fuchsia-dyed hair and red and black leggings Yukio emits a punkish vibe. Fukushimas alluring angular face magnetizes the camera and provides a focus amid chaotic action. One guy puts Yukio down as a toy and in a way thats what she is - a lethal toy. Shes not joking when she tells Wolverine that shes his bodyguard. Thats whats funny. Okamoto has a tender classical serenity that beautifully belies Marikos stubborn strength. Jackmans best moments come when he looks with bemusement at Yukio and with love at Mariko. He and Okamoto get all the wit and emotion out of the scene when Mariko seals their bond as she adjusts the sash on his kimono. The movie contains some typical summer-blockbuster failings. No villain should utter this line - ""I didnt see that coming"" - ever again. (Its especially grating when the audience sees whats coming.) Tossing bad guys from top floors gets old fast. And a film shouldnt kill off a slew of public figures and ignore the impact of their deaths for the sake of a happily-ever-after - or even a happy-just-for-now - ending. Although Mangolds action sequences dont always snap together with the necessary lucidity you savor their intelligence and vision. One epic ambush is too ambitious for its own good. The director tries to capture Wolverines shock at his own vulnerability at the expense of clarifying pitched combat that contains three dueling forces. Still even in that anarchic stretch individual frames - like a rooftop archer laying down a dead shot - are elating. And a fight scene on top of a bullet train equals the railroad combat in ""Skyfall."" The movie could have upped its laugh quotient without relinquishing any intensity. A quietly hilarious sequence set in a Japanese ""love hotel"" pulls you into the story more than any special effect. ""The Wolverine"" has its own ornery integrity. By the end this anguished mutant sheds his regrets and realizes that he really is a samurai - a supernaturally gifted fighter with a warriors code. This film delivers somber thrills while paving the way for more dashing adventures.

"Review A grumbling Wolverine dilutes Hugh Jackmans powers - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review A grumbling Wolverine dilutes Hugh Jackmans powers The Wolverine Movie review by Kenneth Turan The film stars Hugh Jackman Will Yun Lee Hiroyuki Sanada and Haruhiko Yamanouchi. The film stars Hugh Jackman Will Yun Lee Hiroyuki Sanada and Haruhiko Yamanouchi. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic To the list of standard truisms advanced by Hollywood movies -- money cant buy happiness beauty doesnt ensure love -- ""The Wolverine"" is eager to add another certainty comic book heroes are forever grumbling about their lot in life.One might think that having superpowers or at least extraordinary abilities would make a person cheerful if not downright happy. But no the stalwarts of the Marvel universe like Spider-Man and the Hulk are always moping around letting us know that nobody knows the trouble theyve seen. The grumbliest of these grumblers has always been Wolverine the man with the adamantium claws. As played over and over again to great effect by Hugh Jackman Wolverine can be counted on to be surliness personified a man who would have us believe that the gifts of self-healing and berserker strength are a curse not a blessing.INTERVIEW Hugh Jackman gets to the heart of The Wolverine Jackman has in fact played Wolverine six times on film since his debut as the character in 2000 with a seventh outing in the works and this latest venture reminds us how fortunate we are to have a capable committed actor who exudes masculinity in the title role.Unfortunately not even Jackman can completely rescue his characters latest outing. As directed by the usually reliable James Mangold ""The Wolverine"" is an erratic affair more lumbering than compelling an ambitious film with its share of effective moments that stubbornly refuses to catch fire.Written by Mark Bomback and Scott Frank ""Wolverine"" is based on a graphic novel miniseries by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller that takes Logan the mutants alter ego to Japan and involves him in complicated family dynamics that would not be out of place in ""Days of Our Lives."" But before he takes that fateful trip to the Orient a heavily bearded and long-haired Logan can be found living off the grid in Alaska marking his territory with those fierce claws and scaring man and grizzly alike.As dream-like conversations with the ghost of his great love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) reveals Logan is hiding out from life as a result of the unhappy events of 2006s ""X-Men The Last Stand"" though viewers who have only dim memories of that film will have a hard time understanding exactly what is going on. PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesLogan is rescued from his terminal lassitude by the appearance of Yukio (an engaging Rila Fukushima) a red-haired sprite with a tough attitude who has been looking for the clawed one for more than a year.It seems that a Japanese industrialist named Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) is the Japanese soldier saved by Wolverine in an exciting World War II sequence that begins the film. Now scary-wealthy and seriously ill he wants Logan to come to Japan so he can say goodbye. Or so he says.Once Logan takes the bait things get complicated. For one thing the dying man covets those Wolverine powers. For another his inner circle including his son Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada) his granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and a protective ninja archer named Harada (Will Yun Lee) do not work and play well together.Mangold whose previous films include ""I Walk the Line"" and ""310 to Yuma"" works hard maybe too hard to infuse Japanese local color into the story shooting in iconic spots such as a pachinko parlor and a bullet train. His action sequences are all solid -- a ninja attack in a snowy landscape and a battle on the top of that speedy train are especially good -- but problems in other areas slow things down.VIDEO Qamp;A with Hugh Jackman about his new filmFor one thing ""Wolverines"" grab-bag plot is too scattered and far-fetched to be satisfying. Even the welcome appearance of the evil Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova memorable as Irina in ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"") doesnt make enough of a difference.The film also miscalculates in its romance between Mariko and Logan. Okamoto a former model making her film debut looks lovely but nothing within hailing distance of chemistry between Jackman and her is visible on-screen.Also unsatisfying is the key plot point that has Wolverine facing a mysterious diminution of his powers. The notion of the mutant becoming more human is intriguing in theory but in practice it turns out not to be anything we want to see. If the Wolverine cant be the Wolverine why are we putting up with all that grumbling?kenneth.turanlatimes.com-----------------------------The WolverineMPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence some sexuality and languageRunning time 2 hours 6 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Hugh Jackman Entertainment Movies James Mangold The Wolverine (movie) Tao Okamoto Frank Miller On the Set Movies and TV The Wolverine to break big-budget box office dry spell Review Blue Jasmine a bleak but moving gem Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-wolverine-review-20130725,0,4693204.story",200,thewolverine15,thewolverine,latimes

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The century-old mutant battles evil forces in modern-day Japan. Rated PG-13 (action brief but strong language) BOTTOM LINE A crackerjack action flick thanks to slick directing and a great-looking cast. Emotionally stunted but you wont notice a bit. CAST Hugh Jackman Rila Fukushima Tao Okamoto LENGTH 206 Like the giant chrome samurai that appears without warning in its climactic battle ""The Wolverine"" is a marvel of design. The movie has about as much emotional depth as that robot too but so what? Like most superhero films ""The Wolverine"" depends mostly on sheer mechanics -- both in front of and behind the camera -- and on that level its a resounding success. Hugh Jackman returns as Logan the mutant from the ""X-Men"" films whose mutton chops and adamantine knuckle-knives have earned him the name Wolverine. He has his demons -- Famke Janssen returns as the ghost of his lover Jean Grey -- but hes refreshingly free of superhero angst. Mostly hes just a tough angry loner in the vein of ""The Hulks"" Bruce Banner or Caine of ""Kung Fu."" His main motivation is to avoid beating up rednecks in bars -- but Lord they try his patience. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? There will be further violence when Logan travels to Tokyo to visit Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) a man whose life he once saved. Yashida old and dying but wealthy enough to afford cutting-edge technology would like some of Logans famous self-healing power. ""You dont want what Ive got"" Logan snarls. Few actors could make that line sing but Jackman charismatic and enviably handsome (the 3-D effects are devoted mainly to his shirtless chest) is one of them. Hes also nicely paired with Tao Okamoto (a Japanese Ralph Lauren model making her film debut) who brings an ethereal grace to the role of Yashidas granddaughter Mariko. These two would look great just walking and chewing gum but they also develop a convincing chemistry and even tenderness. Adding cartoon color around the edges are Svetlana Khodchenkova as the fork-tongued Viper and Rila Fukushima as the scarlet-haired clairvoyant Yukio. The bone-snapping head-thwacking action scenes are expertly directed by James Mangold (more than making up for ""Knight and Day"") and the script by Mark Bomback and Scott Frank is pure comic-book in all the right ways (Viper pithily describes herself as ""chemist nihilist capitalist""). Fans of bloated superhero spectacles like ""Man of Steel"" might dismiss ""The Wolverine"" as a flyweight entry. Id call it slick fast brainless fun. 434 VideoNewsdays 5 cant-miss summer movies PLOT The century-old mutant battles evil forces in modern-day Japan. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (action brief but strong language) CAST Hugh Jackman Rila Fukushima Tao Okamoto LENGTH 206 BOTTOM LINE A crackerjack action flick thanks to slick directing and a great-looking cast.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Lets start with the good news. The Marvel crew continues to recruit solid filmmakers to shape their comic-book properties. Its not always a winning formula (remember Ang Lees ""Hulk""? Wish you didnt?) but its a courageous one. For ""The Wolverine"" they hired James Mangold whose back catalog boasts rich character-heavy riffs on police thrillers (""Copland"") music bios (""Walk the Line"") and Westerns (""310 to Yuma""). They sent Hugh Jackmans glowering steel-taloned Logan/ Wolverine to Japan with its neon-dazzling urban nightscapes and lavish historic temples. They give the story time to breathe favoring menace tension and surprisingly romance over cartoonishly violent disorder until the final reel. Whats not to like? Sadly lots. The film is a misconceived misfire over-solemn for its first two acts and overstuffed with BLAM POW TEDIUM at the climax. Ninety minutes in it stops trusting the audience and becomes a movie that seems not to be made for fanboys but by them. Ignoring its disastrous 2009 predecessor ""Origins Wolverine"" the new film operates as a sequel to 2006s ""X Men The Last Stand"" which climaxed with Wolverine killing Jean Grey his increasingly unstable and dangerous mutant love. Nursing his grief in the Canadian North Woods he emerges from his hermit cave to wreak revenge on the hunting party that mortally wounded Logans pet grizzly. 20th Century Fox AP/20th Century Fox As Logan Hugh Jackman confronts his vulnerability in ""The Wolverine."" During this sojourn hes shanghaied by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) a martial-arts whiz with a stunning heart-shaped face and cherry-red hair. She ferries Logan to Tokyo so her boss a dying technology mogul can repay an old debt. Once there Logan faces the tycoons scheming heirs political corruption Yakuza ninjas and his own inner demons. For a superhero the stakes are surprisingly personal. Logans ongoing identity crisis is connected to his physical invulnerability and seeming immortality. Having outlived everyone he has ever loved hes plagued by gauzy apparitions of Jean asking him to join her. Amid the storys repeated references to Japans suicide culture the aged industrialist offers Logan the gift of ""an ordinary death."" The storys only other mutant poison-lipped Viper (vampish hot-eyed Svetlana Khodchenkova) takes him halfway there sapping the heros powers to near-human fragility. When sinister forces threaten the billionaires beautiful granddaughter the newly vulnerable Logan takes her into hiding. Jackman is utterly at home in a role hes playing for the sixth time buffed up to Olympian proportions and persuasive in the action scenes. The fight sequences are closer in spirit to Bond or Bourne set pieces with a hand-to-hand knockout atop a speeding bullet train. Theres even a nod to Kurosawa in the ninja archer scene that turns Logan into a staggering raging pincushion of arrows. But theres nothing he can do to resolve the storys confounding plot twists ghostly visions Chopsticks 101 cultural superficiality and ""Scooby Doo""-quality reveal of the plots true villain. ""The Wolverine"" loses ambition as it proceeds returning to its two-dimensional roots in the finale a generic computer-generated smash-o-rama that will go in no ones scrapbook of favorite superhero sequences. Its just good enough to make you regret that it isnt a lot better.

(AP Photo/20th Century Fox Ben Rothstein) Wolverine Jackman is a wounded warrior in weak Wolverine By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Jul 25 2013 (...) Ben Rothstein Hugh Jackman in a scene from ""The Wolverine."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Ben Rothstein) Ben Rothstein Hugh Jackman in a scene from ""The Wolverine."" (AP Photo/20th Century Fox Ben Rothstein) With the Avengers fully assembled and the Justice League waiting in the wings superhero movies are likely to rule the box office for the foreseeable future. But with great power comes great responsibility. A worthy blockbuster should have epic effects a social context and a larger-than-life hero.While Hugh Jackmans trainer ensures that the razor-clawed immortal called Logan is an impressive specimen the creative team behind ""The Wolverine"" is cowering in the shadows. They betray the lovable curmudgeon with a movie so unspectacular and meaningless it might be mistaken for an old episode of ""The Incredible Hulk.""It literally starts with a bang -- the 1945 bombing of Nagasaki where prisoner-of-war Logan saves the life of a Japanese soldier named Yashida. But the script has nothing to say about mans inhumanity to man. When the ageless Logan awakens from a dream within a dream its more than 60 years later and hes living a hermits life in the Yukon. Yet the movie doesnt dwell on his existential angst either. His hibernation in bear country is just a prelude to his supporting role in somebody elses family drama. He is flushed out of hiding by Yashidas sword-wielding granddaughter Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who says the dying man wishes to repay Logan for saving his life. But when Yukio and Logan arrive in Tokyo the aging tycoon (Hal Yamanouchi) displays a peculiar form of gratitude He offers to siphon the immortality from Logans DNA to prolong his own life and attend the politically expedient wedding of favored granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto).When Logan refuses the offer it gets expressed more forcefully by Yashidas evil nurse (Svetlana Khodchenkova) who turns out to be a mutant called Viper who can rob Logan of his self-healing powers. So for a long chunk of the movie the Wolverine is wounded and on the run from gangsters who want a piece of Marikos inheritance. With Mariko torn between her grandfathers wishes her samurai sweetheart (Will Hun Lee) and the hirsute superhero and with Logan torn between Mariko and the ghost of his dead lover Phoenix (Famke Janssen) things become very confusing. And the mediocre mushy stuff isnt alleviated by enough action. Most of it is swordplay and much of it is enacted by the young women while the Wolverine watches. Then to add insult to injury a credit-sequence teaser scene assures us that theyll get it right the next time. A seventh ""X-Men"" movie?

Comments (2) click to enlarge The Wolverine Video Rated PG-13  126 minutes  2013 In his sixth outing as the immortal manicure-challenged mutant Hugh Jackman is upstaged by the CGI despite being more buff than ever. This time around the Marvel Comics superhero is plucked out of retirement to pay his last respects to the dying Japanese magnate he rescued during World War II. The production design and fight choreography show craft but ultimately as in X-Men Origins Wolverine (2009) the plot boils down to an evil geniuss obsession with creating a new being from used parts. It may be a streamlined 21st-century take on the Frankenstein story but its not an improvement; for a 3D adventure this noisy action fantasy falls as flat as cardboard. James Mangold directed.

This pissed-off man of Adamantium claws is stalking new ground (Japan) and his fight with yakuza on top of Tokyos speeding bullet train is a wowser. It helps that Wolfie loses his powers and shows a human side that he makes like James Bond in You Only Live Twice and that he makes out with the lovely Mariko (Tao Okamoto). Sticking to Chris Claremont and Frank Millers Marvel Comics blueprint director James Mangold (Walk the Line) shows style and snap. Then in the final third he lets the movie sink in CGI shit.

Starring Hugh Jackman Rila Fukushima and Tao Okamoto. Directed by James Mangold. (PG-13. 120 minutes.) Somewhere along the line somebody must have had a crazy idea that maybe for once the Wolverine required a decent script and shouldnt rely only on action audience goodwill and the sight of Hugh Jackman with his shirt off. And so a team was assembled made up of people who have made some very good movies. Those movies are too many to list here but for a taste Director James Mangold made ""Walk the Line"" and ""310 to Yuma"" and screenwriters Mark Bomback Scott Frank and Christopher McQuarrie made ""Live Free or Die Hard"" ""Out of Sight"" and ""The Usual Suspects"" respectively. This time out nobody is slumming. Within five minutes its apparent that the audience and ""The Wolverine"" are in good hands. The movie a sequel to 2009s ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" begins with three gripping sequences including a vivid one in which our hero survives the atomic bomb blast at Nagasaki. Of course he does - hes that kind of person. His hair and skin may be burned off but he flexes and growls and a moment later everything has grown back.

Logan (Hugh Jackman) is shirtless in ""The Wolverine"" - dont worry. But thats not all there is to it this time in this well-conceived sequel. Photo Ben Rothstein Twentieth Century Fox The Wolverine review Looking sharp 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Less immediately apparent than the quality of the action is the subtle and welcome change the filmmakers have wrought in Wolverine. Of the mutant superhero X-Men he was always the sad sack the depressive the self-hating one the one who didnt want to use his powers; but in ""The Wolverine"" he is less angst-ridden and more angry and motivated which activates the movie. Straight-up action hero At the start he is drifting and haunted by nightmares but he still has the gumption to pick a fight when he witnesses an injustice. In the best way he is more like a straight-up action hero - no longer a miserable guy like Lon Chaney Jr.s Wolf Man but capable dangerous and when its called for sarcastic. The clash between mutants and humans has been the relentless focus of previous ""X-Men"" movies. ""The Wolverine"" drops that exhausted subject in favor of something more clear-cut and immediate The Wolverine is asked to travel to Japan in order to say goodbye to the man whose life he saved in Nagasaki. The Wolverine whos not doing much of anything these days besides growing out his sideburns agrees and soon gets involved in a tangled and dangerous conflict over the old mans will. The old man skips over his own son and makes his granddaughter Marika (Tao Okamoto) the richest woman in Asia. A nice feature of ""The Wolverine"" is that it always stays with our hero and his task is always simple and easy to grasp despite whatever complicating machinations are taking place off camera. He saves Marikas life - as soon as people find out that she is about to inherit everything armies of assassins pop out from everywhere - and he becomes determined to keep her alive. Why? Because hes a nice guy and he likes her. Unfortunately the Wolverine is not the best relationship material at the moment. He cant go to sleep without having nightmares that cause him to leap out of the sheets waving his adamantine knuckle blades ready to kill anything that moves. Handsome or not he is definitely a case for separate beds. ""The Wolverine"" is the first film from the X-Men universe to show Jackman to full advantage. The actor has worked himself into a physical condition that is downright humbling or inspiring depending on your viewpoint and his performance is in the best action tradition of strength and humor. The action sequences are not perfunctory and though they had to have been cooked up on a computer they dont look like it. Or at least theyre imaginative enough that you dont have time to think of them in that way. Train chase For example theres a chase on top of a train a familiar action-movie trope last seen as recently as ""The Lone Ranger"" a few weeks ago. But the chase in ""The Wolverine"" takes place on a Japanese bullet train going 300 mph which completely changes the dynamic. The scene is faster quieter and more eerie and the fighting requires different strategies. ""The Wolverine"" shows that while originality would be nice a little novelty and enthusiasm in the presentation of the familiar can be quite enough. The bottom line is that audiences arent stupid and will not settle for just anything as the anemic box office for recent blockbusters is showing. ""The Wolverine"" deserves to break out from the pack. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Wolverine The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wolverine-the ) Wolverine The (United States 2013) July 25 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Finally - a superhero movie that doesnt feel like every other superhero movie. The Wolverine proves that its possible to have a movie based on a comic book franchise that doesnt involve mass destruction the fate of the planet and a seemingly indestructible bad guy. The Wolverine is a surprisingly personal intimate tale (at least insofar as an X-Men spinoff can be considered ""intimate"") - more of a crime story with superhero flavoring than an all-out CGI effects action orgy. Thats not to intimate theres no action - theres enough to keep Wolverine fans involved including a tremendous train-top chase/fight - but The Wolverine is character-based. Thats something none of the other 2013 superhero movies can boast. As a brand ""Wolverine"" has taken something of a hit. It started with a fan backlash against the third film in the original X-Men trilogy and continued into the lackluster origin story X-Men Origins Wolverine. Toning things down is probably the right direction to take the character at least for a single story. It allows us to re-connect with Logan (Hugh Jackman) in the post-X-Men Last Stand universe. When the movie begins hes alone and isolated. The Wolverine is about his coming to grips with his immortality and his quest to put his past behind him and arrive at a place where he can return to his role as a ""soldier."" It also involves Logans tentative steps toward loving someone other than Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) whose image dominates his dreams and nightmares. The majority of The Wolverine transpires in Japan which lends the movie an exotic flair. Hes there to bid farewell to an old compatriot billionaire industrialist Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) who lies on his dying bed. When the old man dies Logan becomes the unwitting protector of his granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) who has been targeted for kidnapping by the Yakuza. Marikos closest childhood friend Yukio (Rila Fukushima) becomes Logans sidekick and he is aided in his quest by another of Marikos protectors Kenuichio Harada (Will Yun Lee). Theres also a mutant involved the mysterious Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) whose ultimate goals are unclear but whose methods such as robbing Wolverine of his self-healing powers are deadly. The Wolverines director James Mangold is better known for drama than action and much of the material in this movie plays to his strengths. The exception is the climax which comes across as disappointingly generic in the wake of a mostly fresh first 90 minutes. Mangold does a better job with thriller elements and character interaction than he does with the introduction of a robot that looks like it got lost on the way to Iron Man 3. This is of course Hugh Jackmans movie and no one comes close to upstaging him. Jackman one of the more charismatic actors currently working in superhero movies is fully invested in this project. His eye-popping physique is on full display in a topless scene; he looks more like Schwarzenegger in his prime than the guy who played Jean Valjean. Jackman evidences some nice chemistry with his two female co-stars Rile Fukushima who executes a lot of martial arts stunts as Robin to Wolverines Batman and model-turned-actress Tao Okamoto who plays the love interest. Svetlana Khodchenkovas Viper and Will Yun Lees Harada are underused - The Wolverine could have done more with them and less with the big silver samurai robot. The Wolverine begins with a bang - literally. The flashback to the atomic bombing of Nagasaki is one of the films big money shots and it sets the stage nicely for what later transpires. For the most part the look of the film is heavily influenced by film noir and translates poorly to the post-conversion 3-D. This is yet another example of a production that should have been allowed to open in 2-D only. Hollywoods decree that most big summer movies should be released in 3-D is damaging the formats limited credibility. Theres no reason why a naturally dark movie should be subjected to a process that further limits light but thats precisely what has happened. The change-of-pace evident in The Wolverine saves it from the ""just another superhero"" movie label and offers an antidote to the fatigue that may have set in for the populace in general. Sometimes smaller is the way to go and Jackmans abilities are perfectly suited for a movie that requires some acting to accompany the stunts and special effects. And for those who like post-credits Easter eggs The Wolverine offers a big memorable one. Whatever you do dont leave until youve seen it (youll know it when it happens about 1/3 of the way through the end credits). Its the cherry on the top of an otherwise tasty summer treat.

"The Wolverine Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Wolverine is mutant who plays to balconies  Wolverine surprises same for Fruitvale Station and The Attack Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips with another ""Reel Thursdays"" with a review of ""The Wolverine"" three must-see films and a tribute to Dennis Farina. (Posted on July 25 2013) Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips with another ""Reel Thursdays"" with a review of ""The Wolverine"" three must-see films and a tribute to Dennis Farina. (Posted on July 25 2013) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Every time Hugh Jackmans up there on screen dining out on the rage stew that is the Wolverine I think back to his Tony Award-winning performance as entertainer Peter Allen in ""The Boy From Oz."" It was a terrible musical but a wonderful Broadway turn flamboyant exuberance personified. Each strand of this performers DNA is about giving the audience a great time. Hes a strutter and in ""The Wolverine"" Jackmans sixth and most dominant appearance as the Marvel Comics character the immortal mutton-chopped loner looks as if he has been spending all his time up in the Canadian wilderness with a personal trainer waiting for his close-up.Logan/Wolverine is not the only mutant in ""The Wolverine"" -- Svetlana Khodchenkova slinks around as Viper with her flicking tongue of death -- but the film is largely quasi-human and it burrows into its own tunnel a long way from the previous ""X-Men"" pictures which always risk overcrowding. This time Logan returns to Japan at the behest of a mysterious red-haired woman (Rila Fukushima). Decades earlier Logan survived the atomic bombing of Nagasaki while saving the life of Japanese soldier Shingen Yashida (played by Hiroyuki Sanada). The soldier became a powerful and corrupt industrialist. On his deathbed the dying man is looking to his old savior for one last favor. But the Japanese gangsters known as yakuza intrude and Logan has sworn to protect Yashidas daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and theres your plot distilled from the four-part 1982 Marvel saga written by Chris Claremont and penciled by Frank Miller.The screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie concocted the adaptation of ""The Wolverine"" that got this project going. Rewrites ensued by Mark Bomback and Scott Frank; James Mangold took it before the cameras in Australia and Japan. The results are quite good -- the same old angst and grandiosity writ smaller than usual and better for it. The X-Men crews intersections with real-life wartime horrors have long been signposts of the serious aspirations of the material. Watching ""The Wolverine"" one may resist the leveling and seared flesh of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki as fodder for another superhero picture. But Mangold handles it well ""The Wolverine"" keeps its characters front and center and only near the end does it turn into a routine grinding action movie. Along the way theres a swell battle atop a speeding bullet train the films highlight. Also we get the occasional lyric interlude between Logan and the dream/memory of the woman he loved and lost (Famke Janssen) the source of all his undying grief.The last couple of Wolverine movies provided their share of undying grief as well the wrong kind the mediocre movie kind. ""The Wolverine"" wont change anybodys mind about the character or about what Jackman can do with it. Its simply a more focused scenario than usual full of violence done up with a little more coherence and visceral impact than usual. Mangold doesnt bring tons of personality to ""The Wolverine"" but he does bring a reasonable and honorable sense of craft trading in iconography borrowed from Westerns and Easterns and all sorts of movies. Marco Beltramis musical score likewise carries echoes of previous movie themes but its evocative and lower-keyed than the usual Marvel bash.

He growls and prowls. Instead of playing saintly Jean Valjean Jackman is back for his sixth turn as Logan the Marvel comics mutant with the pinking-shear fingernails. Not Les Miserables ... Les Razorables. In three X-Men movies and their 2011 prequel and in his own 2009 showcase X-Men Origins Wolverine the genial Aussie stud has harnessed his inner lupine to embody a pretty cool character in a so-so film franchise. Having already moved forward and backward in time in the preceding pictures Logan goes sideways here a trip to Tokyo where he uses his preternatural combat skills against a yakuza clan and flying martial artists. Imagine that Sean Connerys James Bond in his 1967 Japanese jaunt You Only Live Twice had to confront mutants and ninjas (no turtles) and you have a hint of director James Mangolds mostly sober travelogue with a few zippy action scenes. For Logan and Jackman The Wolverine is a working vacation only peripherally related to the central X-Men themes. (MORE Richard Corlisss Review of X-Men Origins Wolverine) Recall that X-Men First Class appropriated the 1962 Cuban missile crisis for its climax. The Wolverine begins on Aug. 9 1945 on a Japanese island where the imperial army holds its lone prisoner at the bottom of a deep well. We know from his CV and mammoth ripped torso that Logan could easily get out; hes no mere mortal like Bruce Wayne who in The Dark Knight Rises spent a full half-hour of screen time escaping from a similar stone dungeon. Is Logan taking another vacation? No he is waiting his chance to do good in an explosive crisis the atom bomb that falls on nearby Nagasaki. He saves the life of a soldier Yashida (Ken Yamamura) by shielding him from deadly radiation at the bottom of the well. In gratitude Yashida offers him a hallowed samurai sword and ... Logan wakes from this dream-memory at home in bed his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) purring soothing words at his side. We know that she died in X-Men The Last Stand so this too is a dream with Jean offering postmortem wisdom from the afterlife like Russell Crowes Jor-El in Man of Steel. In what passes for Logans real life he has thrown off responsibility and embraced solitude in the snowy Alaskan wilds -- Les Blizzardables? A lone wolf he lives in the deep woods his only neighbor a grizzly bear -- Les Grizzlerables? When he goes into town for supplies a hunters mistreatment of that majestic beast stirs Logan to flaunt his claws -- Les Slasherables? (MORE Why Tom Hoopers Les Miserables Is a YouTube Opera) Also on hand is the pink-haired death-divining Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who has been tracking Logan for a year and persuades him to journey to Japan and renew his acquaintance 68 years later with Yashida. Now a wealthy businessman (and played by Hal Yamanouchi) with a vast empire and a host of relatives scheming to commandeer his legacy Yashida summons Logan to his deathbed for one last gift/request/command that the X-Man surrender his burden of immortality and transfer it to a zillionaire eager to shoulder it. Logan assures the old man ""You dont want what Ive got."" Oh yes he does. Cue the palace intrigue in the script by Christopher McQuarrie Mark Bomback and Scott Frank. At Yashidas funeral hell ensues. Ninjas under the command of Harada (Will Yun Lee) battle yakuza who kidnap the old mans granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto). Logan gives chase -- a long impressive one involving Haradas nifty parkour moves and Logans quick trip with Mariko through Ueno Station and onto a bullet train. After easily overwhelming most of the yakuza thugs he encounters a more resolute one on top of the train where he and his nimble adversary slash at each other while trying to avoid the many low-hanging obstructions that career a few feet above them. For about five minutes action paradise. (MORE Can Japan Make a Train Thats Faster Than a Speeding Bullet?) Like a ronin warrior with no master Mangold has wandered through many genres indie drama (Heavy) romantic comedy (Kate amp; Leopold with Jackman as the male lead) musical biopic (Walk the Line) western (310 to Yuma) and spy adventure (Knight and Day). The director lends an acute sense of place to each project and here he contrasts Logans wolf-out-of-woodlands loner attitude with the Japanese traditions of understatement and at least ostensible family respect. In one scene a couple dozen ninjas pinion Logan with arrows of steel strings until he is as perforated as Toshiro Mifune at the end of Akira Kurosawas Throne of Blood. Some of the films Japanese characters appeared 30 years ago in a Marvel comics series by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. Since all but three major roles -- Logan Jean and a veteran female adversary Viper -- are taken by Japanese actors often speaking in their native language The Wolverine often seems like a Tokyo family drama that Logan has quixotically parachuted into. He is there really to test his love for Jean by having a brief fling with Mariko -- can you cheat on your dead girlfriend? Okamoto a Ralph Lauren model making her film-acting debut holds the screen with her mournful beauty stark collarbones and one of the movie worlds most gorgeous philtrums. Logan must also contend with Viper (the generically sexy Svetlana Khodchenkova) whose venomous smooch robs Logan of some of his strength -- Les Kisserables? When hes slashed or shot his wounds dont instantly heal; he may be approaching the mortality status of old Yashida. (MORE Why X-Men First Class Gets a Failing Grade) But in any Marvel film the ladies are secondary; The Wolverine is no Les Mssrables. Guy-centric at its core the movie is bound to contain at least one example of sadomasochistic heroism -- ""You arent gonna wanna watch this"" Logan tells Yukio before he performs impromptu heart surgery on himself -- and must reach a climax of men fighting men. Or here Logan confronts a giant robot-man in a tower laboratory borrowed from Dr. Frankenstein. ""What kind of monster are you?"" a man asks Logan just before getting skewered. ""The Wolverine"" he replies embracing his destiny -- not just on his Tokyo tour but in next summers X-Men Days of Future Past which gets a teasing preview at the end of this movie (and which will be directed by Bryan Singer who helmed the first two X-Men movies). Thats fine; let all Marvel franchises have as long a life as Logan. But could Singer let Jackman sing a few numbers as the knife-fingered mutant? They could call it Les Scissorables.

That movie widely dissed by comics buffs for its canonical violations and general stupidity gets completely ignored here and absolutely is not a prerequisite. In fact ""The Wolverine"" comes close to being a low-key character reboot and along the way delivers a solid popcorn-flavored action-adventure that should delight genre fans as well as admirers of Jackmans alarmingly muscled physique. While this movie lacks the ambition or the scale of ""Iron Man 3"" or ""Man of Steel"" and probably wont challenge their box-office supremacy either taken on its own terms ""The Wolverine"" is the cleanest least pretentious and most satisfying superhero movie of the summer.You can definitely see ""The Wolverine"" even if youre utterly unfamiliar with previous X-Men movies or comics although I imagine hardly anyone will. (Just turn on your phone and text me during the movie if youre confused Kidding.) Mangold (previously the director of ""Knight and Day"" and ""Walk the Line"") and writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank do a nice job of supplying a few back-story clues without ever backtracking into fan-familiar material or slowing down the storys considerable momentum. We begin with a bang literally - the really big bang that destroyed the city of Nagasaki in 1945 when the human-animal hybrid secret weapon known as Logan (Jackman) was being held nearby in a POW camp. (Although the movies depiction of the Nagasaki bombing strays pretty far from reality there really was an American POW who survived the A-bomb in conditions not unlike Logans.)Logan saves the life of a young Japanese officer who has shown him mercy and who is reluctant to commit seppuku and die alongside his comrades. That act of kindness is the fuel for the present-tense story that brings Logan back to Japan 60-odd years later where his old friend Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) now a technology zillionaire is close to death. (In case youre wondering Logan is 200-something years old and more or less immortal so no unlike Yashida he doesnt look any older.) But before we even get to that Mangold pulls off a nifty set of nested Christopher Nolan-style dream narratives Wolverine dreams about World War II Japan and then wakes into a dream about Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) his dead mutant lover and then wakes again to find himself living as a mountain man in the 21st century somewhere in Alaska or the Yukon.Honestly that whole first chapter with Jackman playing Logan as a brooding haunted figure who prefers grizzly bears to human beings possesses such potent atmosphere that I wish the movie could have stayed in the frozen north a lot longer. Inevitably once ass-kicking redhead ninja chick Yukio (Rila Fukushima) shows up to drag Logan off to Tokyo to visit the dying Yashida ""The Wolverine"" steadily moves in a more formulaic direction. That formula in this case is the Asian action film and Mangold captures its tone and energy with considerable enthusiasm. Despite a limited track record with action cinema Mangold and cinematographer Ross Emery craft several rip-roaring set pieces including a full-on martial arts fight sequence in a Buddhist temple and a hand-to-hand battle between Wolverine and a yakuza gangster atop a 300 mph bullet train. (That one really might be the summers best action scene.) What combination of weight training chemical stimulus and digital effects accounts for Hugh Jackmans 44-year-old body I dont know but as usual he does a fair amount of his own stunts. You Might Also Like This movies version of Wolverine is a fairly standard noir hero a growly loner who seeks justice despite his disavowal of all morality and who is torn between the dead woman he loves and the extraordinarily beautiful living one who melts in his presence - that being Yashidas granddaughter and heir Mariko (Tao Okamoto). But Bomback and Franks script gives Jackman a lot to chew on and he pushes the Clint Eastwood impersonation behind this character into some new terrain especially after the statuesque but evil mutant Viper (ice-blonde Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova) finds a way to undo Wolverines healing powers and render him mortal. Again those unversed in X-Men lore wont have heard of Viper aka Madame Hydra - but really whats to know? Shes tall shes beautiful shes evil and she can awesomely peel off her skin in snakelike fashion. There you have it. Ill have to rely on true comics fans to untangle the appearances of Viper the Yashida clan and the rather disappointing armored warrior known as the Silver Samurai in ""The Wolverine"" and to figure out how they interact with previous tellings of this story. What moviegoers will notice is a severe energy drop-off in the supposedly climactic final act of ""The Wolverine"" - not nearly enough to ruin the movies overall enjoyment but more than enough to return us to highly generic territory. This might be Jackmans best outing as Wolverine but the purpose of the picture is to be a short-term placeholder and fan-pleaser keeping the door open for another sequel without guaranteeing one and marking time until Bryan Singers full-scale X-Men reunion movie is ready next summer. Oh speaking of which Franchise fans might just as well stick around through the closing credits just in case theres something to see. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

When the posse of super-powered outcasts was first brought to the screen by Bryan Singer in 2000 Hugh Jackmans mutton-chopped adamantium-clawed Wolverine emerged as the stand-out super-freak. And Hollywood accounting being what it is he was naturally granted his own solo encore in 2009s underwhelming X-Men Origins Wolverine a silly spin-off that never quite came together. Now to wipe the slate clean Jackman and director James Mangold (Knight and Day; Girl Interrupted) have teamed up to bring out the claws once again in The Wolverine. And while its definitely a more entertaining and far deeper film than the last Wolverine outing it still falls short of the top tier of Marvel tentpoles like the fizzy Iron Man and Sam Raimis Spider-Man. Based on Chris Claremont and Frank Millers much-loved 1982 comic-book arc The Wolverine is an existential (and at times soddenly heavy) story about our razor-taloned hero grappling with the burden of immortality and loss. But before we wade into that therapy session the film opens with a harrowing sequence set like most of the film in Japan. Its WWII and Jackmans Logan is imprisoned in a Japanese POW camp in Nagasaki as B-29s fly overhead to deliver the atomic bomb. During the blast he saves one of his captors a soldier named Yashida who during the explosion learns of Wolverines invincibility and ability to heal his own wounds. Decades later Logan who hasnt aged a day has renounced violence and lives as a hirsute hermit in the Yukon. There hes tracked down by a punky red-haired Japanese pixie named Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who informs him that the man he saved back in the prison camp is now a rich industrialist on his deathbed. Hes requesting Logans presence to thank him and settle the karmic debt that he believes he owes him. Of course thats not all he wants. Logan heads to Japan to pay his respects and discovers not only that the aging Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) wants to steal the secret to Logans immortality but also that he has a granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) whos about to inherit his fortune and is in need of Logans unique brand of badass protection. Why Logan complies is never really explained. Regardless Logan and Mariko are on the run from a lethal posse of tattooed Yakuza and some other samurai-style baddies straight out of the Kill Bill playbook including Yashidas femme fatale blonde nurse (Svetlana Khodchenkova) who possesses certain viper-y gifts of her own. As Logan and his charge hit the road sparks fly ninjas attack and Wolverine begins to experience something he never has before -- the actual fear of death. Hes been sapped of his eternal life force and now when he gets into one of his signature slice-and-dice brawls the wounds he suffers no longer cauterize and heal. Hes both physically and emotionally vulnerable. In other words human. All of this makes for a Wolverine tale thats more loaded with psychological questions (his immortality is seen as a curse) and makes the haunted character more interesting. Still thats no excuse for the films gauzy dream sequences with Famke Janssens Jean Grey and its overall bloat which leads up to a preposterous (and endless) final half hour. Over the past decade the Marvel brand has become a virtual guarantee of box-office bang. But someone over at the companys Quality Control Department really needs to look into tightening up these films. They just dont know when to end. That said its worth pointing out two things that The Wolverine gets right (aside from Jackmans always excellent strong-and-silent-type performance as Logan). The first is an action sequence that occurs mid-way in the film when Wolverine is being pursued on top of a bullet train. By now weve all seen so many beat-downs atop locomotives that theyve become numbingly similar. But the one in The Wolverine is so frantic and adrenalized (not to mention the only part of the film that takes advantage of 3-D) that the familiar becomes new again. The film also sticks the landing on a brief teaser scene after the end credits that hints at future developments in the X-Men universe. I wont spoil the pleasure of what happens. But you have to hand it to Marvel for managing to leave audiences breathless in anticipation of a sequel after making them sit through two-plus hours of merely satisfactory storytelling.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com THE WOLVERINE Share Comment Loosely adapted from an essential 1980s comics storyline co-created by artist and sometime filmmaker Frank Miller (""Sin City"") ""The Wolverine"" dispatches its hero to Japan to grapple with a sinister criminal element and his own virtual immortality. For the uninitiated the scene shift is surprising -- and an effective way of dramatizing and accentuating the heros dual nature. Building on the previous installments glimpse of Wolverine as a combatant in many wars the story opens on an eerie flashback to WWII Nagasaki where hes a POW who saves a Japanese soldier from the bomb. Cut to the present-day Yukon where Logan is now a headcase with a mountain mans beard and lingering visions of lost love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) the X-Men teammate he was forced to put down.

The noble Superman or the snarky Iron Man? The Dark Knight of despair or the red-white-and-blue Captain America? And they will argue because well thats what comic-book fans do. Thats part of the fun. But in a summer which has already seen a couple of those characters come back in new adventures -- and some other would-be blockbusters go bust -- heres something thats hard to debate ""The Wolverine"" is the best superhero film since ""The Avengers"" -- maybe even since ""The Dark Knight."" To be honest low expectations do help. The last ""Wolverine"" solo film -- the 2009 how-it-began picture ""Origins"" -- didnt thrill too many fans. And if the original franchise hadnt been losing its mutant power the studio wouldnt have rebooted things with the recent ""X-Men First Class."" But fans of the sharp-knuckled fellow always knew that he had a lot of potential and that one day hed get the vehicle to show it off. And ""The Wolverine"" is the film that does it -- and it does it by putting him in completely unfamiliar surroundings. Set sometime after 2006s ""The Last Stand"" it has the Wolverine wandering the Yukon living in the wilderness and trying to forget his guilt over Jean Greys death. Which is kind of hard as she keeps showing up in his dull overlit dreams (not director James Mangolds subtlest touch). But then an old friend from his complicated past -- and immortal beings tend to have complicated pasts -- asks to see him one last time. And so the Wolverine (or Logan as hes known to his friends) goes to Japan where theres a battle over a billion-dollar conglomerate. Except this battle comes complete with yakuza gangs. And ninja armies. And a mad serpentine scientist known as Viper a literally toxic individual who speaks with a forked tongue and has plans to drain the Wolverine of his formidable power. Yeah just your average day in the life of an ex-X-Man. Although Foxs ""The Wolverine"" is a big summer movie its also a smart one and other studios could take some tips. For one thing although its a big-budget film it wasnt insanely expensive (it reportedly cost half of what ""The Lone Ranger"" did) and every dollar is on the screen. Its crew is impressive too and full of grown-ups. The credited screenwriters include Christopher McQuarrie (who wrote ""The Usual Suspects"") and Scott Frank (""Get Shorty""); director Mangolds films include ""I Walk the Line."" This isnt a bunch of first-timers and music-video mavens. And -- unlike say ""After Earth"" -- the film both gives us something fans havent seen before (the Wolverine dueling with samurai swordsmen? Im there) and a character they already have a lot invested in facing both new challenges and some old guilty feelings. Jackman -- now in his sixth appearance as the mutant -- is both physically ripped and emotionally torn up; when the film begins this moody hero is at his lowest point ever. The actor is clearly having a great time particularly the chance to channel some early Eastwood (""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" is a definite reference point). Jackman gets good support from the rest of the cast too particularly Rila Fukushima as an almost anime action-hero and Svetlana Khodchenkova as the villainous Viper. (While the X-Men series has always been known for its strong female characters this episode is particularly woman-driven -- something else other studios could learn from.) True after the film is over you could pick a hole or two in the story -- this is one of those movies where instead of simply shooting a person and being done with it the villains launch all sorts of nefarious plots. And the climax demands a pretty out-of-character twist. But you can save those quibbles for the ride home afterward or online debates with other comic-book fans. While youre actually watching the film youll be too busy enjoying amazing action sequences like a hand-to-hand combat aboard a speeding bullet train or the rampage of a giant robo-samurai. And delighting in a movie that triumphantly puts the ""X-Men"" franchise back where it belongs On the A list. Ratings note The film contains violence gore strong language and sexual situations. The Wolverine (PG-13) Fox (126 min.) Directed by James Mangold. With Hugh Jackman.

As summer comic-book blockbusters go The Wolverine is not as elephantine as it could have been. Its more well wolverine--bony loping a little shaggy--and blessedly director James Mangold doesnt get bogged down in mythology. You dont need to diagram the convoluted relationships between Stan Lee and Jack Kirbys X-Men characters to figure out whats going on. All you really need to know is that Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) a mutant whose knuckles sprout adamantium claws whenever hes threatened has a secret that haunts him He killed the person he loved best Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and now she keeps appearing in his dreams wearing a silk nightie and slinging accusatory barbs more piercing than any set of mutant talons. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - But like so many of this summers comic-book movies particularly the hollow forgettable behemoth Iron Man 3 The Wolverine represents a missed opportunity. Mangold tilts the movie heavily toward elaborate action sequences and skimps on the more romantic angles which is especially frustrating since Jackman is the kind of actor who can deftly handle both. Thats clear from the stunning double opening two scenes so striking that either could have been used to kick things off. In the first Wolverines long-lived alter ego Logan finds himself hiding out in a deep hole on Nagasaki just as the bomb is about to hit. A young Japanese soldier threatens to root him out but Logan ends up saving his life when that mushroom cloud of doom finally erupts Just as the soldier is about to commit seppuku as his fellow warriors have already done Logan whisks him down into the hidey-hole. The act sets up an intriguing slant Even though cultural mores dictate that this soldier should be happy to die theres something in him that desperately wants to live.The movies ""second"" opening set somewhere in present-day Ted Nugent territory involves a lumbering grizzly bear--Wolverines spiritual counterpart is not a wolverine it turns out--and a bunch of rednecks who defy the wilderness code. Wolverine righteous dude that he is shows up at their local dive to set them straight. Things begin to look even more promising when a svelte cutie in red Bettie Page bangs arrives during this barroom brawl. As it turns out Yukio (Rila Fukushima) has a connection to that soldier Wolverine saved so many years ago; hes an old man now and its Yukios duty to bring Logan to Japan to fulfill his dying wish. Film Details The Wolverine RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time126 More Info Trailer But not long after The Wolverines energy begins to lag. Like so many of todays action movies The Wolverine consists mostly of one character or another going from here to there doing this and that. Wolverine is off to Japan. Awesome Now what? Yukio drops out of the movie for several long stretches and Wolverine forms an alliance with her childhood friend Mariko (Tao Okamoto) whos perhaps more beautiful but far less interesting. Meanwhile enemies like Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) lurk hoping to get Wolverine in their clutches. And somewhere in there Wolverine gets to do some semi-poetic stuff like open his own chest with his claws.Jackman is terrific in those moments--he shifts between being affable and tortured as if it were no great shakes. Somehow that makes Wolverines suffering believable. With all his brawn he cant escape sadness and his nightmares form a connect-the-dots roadmap through the story Time and again he wakes up only to be looking right into Jean Greys living eyes. Its too good to be true--because of course it isnt--and Jackman packs an extraordinary amount of feeling into these moments. He even looks great in that flat-top hairdo with those little pointed ear-like tufts at the sides.But not even all of Jackmans mighty brawn is enough to hold The Wolverine aloft. Mangold and cinematographer Ross Emery try to keep the whole thing relatively sparkling-looking. And for the most part the action sequences are shot with clarity instead of just piling up in a noisy mishmash. Even so The Wolverine--despite being an improvement on Gavin Hoods muddled 2009 X-Men Origins Wolverine--isnt worthy of Jackmans gifts. Its a reasonably engaging summer diversion a semi-rousing adventure that doesnt make you feel robbed of two hours of your life. The tragedy maybe is that were happy to settle for that.

Director James Mangold.Cast Hugh Jackman Rila Fukushima Will Yun Lee.Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence some sexuality and language. RELATED NEWS Five essential Hugh Jackman films By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Jul 24 2013 224 PM Some gigs are just hard to step away from Boxer. Rock star. Football coach. Wolverine. And so it is in ""The Wolverine"" in which we find Logan (Hugh Jackman back for his sixth stint as the character) with his claws retracted living as a long-haired hermit in the Yukon having sworn to former girlfriend Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who he um kind of killed but who keeps showing up in his dreams that he wont hurt anyone again. Yeah well. That lasts about 10 minutes. Some redneck hunters raise Logans ire but before he can do too much damage hes interrupted by Yukio (Rila Fukushima). She is handy with a ninja sword and bears a message Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) whom Logan has saved during the 1945 bombing of Nagasaki is dying and wishes to tell him goodbye. But not really. What Yashida now a rich business magnate wants is Logans immortality a deal that would allow Logan to live the mortal life he has dreamed of. Its a tempting offer but Logan is hesitant to give that ""gift"" (to him its a curse) to anyone. Not that it matters. Soon Logan who still is able to whip out his claws if needed finds his powers are weakening. When he gets shot (or stabbed or beaten or gored or whatever) he doesnt heal immediately. He feels pain and it doesnt go away. Can mortality be far behind? Its an interesting premise tackling a question that your smarter vampires struggle with. Is life unending a life at all? Whatever you gain in immortality do you lose with the eventual inevitable loss of all those whom you love? Jackman is a good-enough actor to give some credence to Logans weighing of the question. But despite the introspection this is a summer superhero movie so you know bang boom pow The unwritten rules of these movies evidently state that the final 20 minutes be devoted to ridiculously over-amped fight scenes and ""The Wolverine"" is no exception. How do we get there? Both Logan and Yukio find themselves trying to protect Mariko (Tao Okamoto) Yashidas granddaughter and reluctant heir to his empire. Along the way we will meet Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) and the Silver Samurai (lots of nuts and bolts and computer effects) among other characters. None are interesting enough to provide anything in the way of memorable villainy. In one scene Logan is set upon by a small army of archers. They fill his back with arrows and pull on the ropes tied to them while Logan struggles on. Theres a metaphor in there somewhere. Dont worry director James Mangolds film is better than 2009s ""X-Men Origins Wolverine."" Its more thoughtful and a couple of the action scenes are outstanding particularly one in which Wolverine fights a guy atop a bullet train traveling at 300 mph. The physics on display probably dont hold up to scrutiny but the adrenaline and excitement certainly do. But to what end? Much like the Superman movie ""Man of Steel"" earlier this summer the filmmakers work at creating a new take on an old protagonist and then dont really have much new to do with him once theyve achieved that. Its a good effort. Just not an entirely successful one.

VPC Claudia Puig USA TODAY 919 a.m. EDT July 25 2013The superhero faces being de-clawed in this moody but formulaic X-Men spinoff.Logan (Hugh Jackman) heads to Japan for a shot to cure his mutation in The Wolverine.(Photo Ben Rothstein 20th Century Fox)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review 1/2 out of fourStars Hugh Jackman Rila Fukushima Hiroyuki Sanada Svetlana Khodchenkova Famke JanssenRated PG-13; runtime 2 hours 6 minutes; opens Thursday in some theaters and Friday nationwideWolverine returns still vigorous and razor-clawed but in the throes of an existential crisis.The Wolverine (  1/2 our of four; rated PG-13; opens Thursday in some theaters and Friday nationwide) features some powerful action scenes juxtaposed with sequences in which Hugh Jackmans character re-lives his past and ponders his future. Initially the century-old Logan/Wolverine is disaffected and reluctant to return to his life as a mutant hero. Created as a super weapon he has come to fear that his powers make him a danger to society.But in short order hes fighting ninjas and using his famous adamantium claws against thugs atop a speeding bullet train. And that after all is what audiences come for.Director James Mangold has fashioned a fairly engrossing if occasionally convoluted tale based on the Marvel Comics figure. But an extended battle meant as a climactic clash grows tedious. And cliches seep into what could have been a fascinating glimpse into a multifaceted character. Still this X-Men spinoff is a marked improvement over 2009sX Men Origins Wolverine.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs summer movie calendarTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersThis version opens intriguingly with Logan living a hermits existence in the woods where he can apparently communicate with grizzlies. An altercation with some obnoxious bear-hunters propels him into the path of the mysterious crimson-haired Yukio (Rila Fukushima). She lures him to Japan where the rest of the film takes place.There is some intriguing insight into Wolverines psyche peppered with cliched lines that cry out to be catchphrases a la ""Hasta la vista baby."" When he dispatches a key Japanese character he says predictably ""sayonara.Though Wolverine is well-crafted visually by director James Mangold who evokes a moody atmosphere there are few surprises and the movie descends into formula.Logan goes to Tokyo at the behest of Lord Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) a man whose life he saved in World War II. Hes now a wealthy industrialist. Once there Logan encounters a sinister atmosphere in which Lord Yashidas granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) is imperiled. Along the way Logan tangles with Marikos ruthless father Shingen Yashida (Hiroyuki Sanada) and is visited by his former love and fellow mutant Jean (Famke Janssen) in interminable cheesy dream-like sequences.Mangold seeks to get deeper into Logans head and tap into the sources of his rage. The director is not always successful revealing Logan/Wolverines complexities but he does capture the characters feral warrior qualities deftly. He also effectively contrasts the ultra-modernity of Japan with its ancient codes of honor.The Wolverine is an intermittently exciting action film anchored by a strong performance by Jackman who embodies Wolverine like no one else could.Be sure to stay all the way through the credits. 77 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 16 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1c30knJ",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/sm4_x69d6Pw/,200,thewolverine34,thewolverine,usatoday

Photo Ben Rothstein A couple of schools of thought on giant Samurai robots wielding flaming-hot 10-foot swords One is that they add spice to the gumbo at noisy blockbusters like ""The Wolverine."" Another is that they always show up in the wrong movies Anytime Ethan Hawke is on the screen sharing his feelings about relationships for instance I pray for a metal fist the size of a Mini Cooper to slam him in the Adams apple but it never seems to happen. ""The Wolverine"" competently directed by James Mangold (""Walk the Line"") is a serviceable superhero movie one that might be thrilling if special-effects pictures came along four times a year instead of four times a month. As it is I found myself spending most of it thinking ""I guess this is going to be a fight scene. Here comes a chase. Another fight. Another chase. Arent these villains falling like dandelions versus a weed whacker? Why is Wolverine impervious to a sword through the heart but captured when a bunch of arrows hit him in the back?"" But our president has advised us that ""We cant take comfort in just being cynical."" So there goes my favorite hobby. The follow-up to 2009s ""Wolverine"" (will the trilogy be completed with ""A Wolverine""?) gets going in 1945 when Wolverine/Logan (Hugh Jackman) the mutant who is super-unable to keep his shirt on is a prisoner in a Japanese camp as the atomic bomb destroys Nagasaki. Today the humane prison guard whose life Logan saved -- I didnt know a manhole cover could protect you from radioactivity -- runs the biggest firm in Asia. The lethal Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) holds Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) prisoner though her actual superpowers remain questionable. (Ben Rothstein) This aged billionaire Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) offers Logan -- who is immortal ageless and gifted with instantaneous healing powers -- a chance to unload his gifts unto his old friend rendering Logan an ordinary mortal. This is tempting Logan has been having dreams in which his ex-woman Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) whom he had to kill after she turned evil in ""X-Men The Last Stand"" begs him to join her in death an option he is seriously considering. Hey fellas anything to stop your old lady from nagging am I right? Logan decides to say no but gets involved in protecting the industrialists quietly sexy granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto whose placid confidence is the best thing in the movie) while joining forces with her sword-fighting childhood friend Yukio (Rika Fukushima) who can (sort of) see the future and warns Logan that she has visions of his death. RELATED HOW ULTIMATE NICE GUY HUGH JACKMAN TRANSFORMS INTO THE WOLVERINE Everybody goes on the run from ninjas yakuza mobsters and half a dozen members of Marikos family who want the inheritance her grandfather bequeathed her as he died. This movie has a case of villain inflation that leaves surprisingly little screen time for the main malefactor a snaky blond temptress called the Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) whose tongue is so vicious that Im surprised they didnt just call her ""Rex Reed."" Im as unclear on what exactly her powers are as I am about Wolverines though She kills most of her prey instantly (with a lizard version of a French kiss) yet with Wolverine she leaves a sort of ticking bomb. Also she can blow CGI poison crystals through the air which looks cool but doesnt always seem to do anything. You might guess that Im not a big fan of the X-Men movies none of which Ive seen twice. The fundamental silliness of everybody having a super-gimmick jars against both the P.C. pretensions and the dim witless dialogue. But I liked that ""The Wolverine"" (which saves a nifty twist for a surprise scene in the middle of the end credits) turns down the volume on the usual din of colliding mutant superpowers. It takes time for some old-fashioned romance (the moments when Mariko and Logan are getting to know each other are nicely done) and some reasonably scintillating action on a more human scale (the highlight is a whooshing fight atop a 300-mph train in which Wolverine fights off mobsters while alternately jumping and ducking overhead barriers). But all roads lead to that giant Samurai robot and the extreme man-manicure he plans to give poor Wolverine. Theres teeming bombast and great gushers of villainy but weve seen it all before and well see it all again probably next week.

Unfortunately this initial hope is squandered and ""The Wolverine"" reveals itself to be a film in desperate need of a point in dire need of consequences and in a wandering search of any semblance of emotional weight. Instead of seeking these attributes ""The Wolverine"" alternatively chooses to make itself generic perfectly palatable and massively predictable. Three people worked on the screenplay for ""The Wolverine"" hacking and Frankensteining the work and it shows because theres no life force as if everyone took the opportunity to remove anything that reached for a modicum of ambition. As mentioned the good that is to be found in ""The Wolverine"" happens early. After a brief prologue set during the final days of World War II the film locates Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) in the wilderness an untamed beast at home amongst the trees and snow walking alongside a grizzly bear in the bitter cold.  He confronts a hunter who is using illegal methods all the while being watched by the mysterious Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who has been sent to bring him back to Japan for equally mysterious reasons. Shes also the best thing about ""Wolverine"" by 100 miles. Half Harajuku girl (with her tall boots and huge striped socks) half prophet and all lethal. Her dark red hair and sullen complexion hint at a female lead with depth one with a tough exterior borne from enduring even tougher circumstances a natural companion to Logans (The Wolverines name) gruff and gritty attitude. In these early scenes flashbacks to Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen) are also utilized and any effective romance in Wolverines life has always sprung forth from the star-crossed Logan/Jean Grey relationship. Intense themes of loyalty and honorable death are also presented. Indeed with flashbacks that resonate and a strong new woman standing with Logan ""The Wolverine"" seems to be on the right track toward being a superhero film that matters the first in a good long while. Its at this point the movie self-destructs and for no reason or gain. Logan and Yukio travel to Japan where a new female lead is introduced and this one is of a far more explicitly romantic nature. Where Yukio was knowing smirks and dark karma Mariko (Tao Okamoto) is straight from ""Im a lady save me"" central casting. To say she is bland is to give oatmeal a bad name for the character of Mariko flat-out murders this film. And why does Logan even need to become embroiled in a relationship that clearly has no real substance? I can only guess groupthink and an apparent aiming for the demographic center are the culprits as ""The Wolverine"" knows that in order to make this a ""date night"" theyll need to have romance. But did they also need the melodrama? Evidently this is a prerequisite as Hugh Jackman and Tao Okamoto fumble their way through an onscreen relationship that has less chemistry than a liberal arts degree. Additionally the villains here dont even rise to the level of ""one-note"" - theyre more like half a note or perhaps a completely dropped trumpet emitting an accidental quarter-note. One of them Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) has no motivations other than being slithering and evil and umm ... being a viper. ""Snakes are the worst"" said ""The Wolverine"" script hoping no one would ask a follow-up question. Whom the other villains are isnt entirely clear so muddled are the characterizations defying clarity at every turn. Yup the plot points that are obvious in ""The Wolverine"" are dumb while the parts with no follow-through or explanation remain largely confusing. ""The Wolverine"" also presents enormous logic problems. Logan and Mariko are on the run in Japan a country featuring one of the densest population centers on Earth and yet they are confronted by Yakuza at every intersection. Japan is treated like a small village and even when the outskirts of cities are used the characters are usually given labeled maps that say ""next plot point here"" with a giant red X. For an audience theres nothing to figure out nothing to consider just bright lights and the big city mixed with occasional fighting noises and clumsy exposition. The other issue that arises in parallel with the ""inconsequential action"" angle is the romantic side of Logan. I mean who really cares? The wolverine is presented as a fearsome character capable of doling out (and taking) huge amounts of punishment only hes spooning and making out with his lady as often as hes fighting for he is the archetype of man loving hard and playing hard too. Naturally this comes off as preposterous and forced. Mostly because weve just met the character of Mariko which saps the momentum of pulling for the fledgling couple but also because the act of saving someone doesnt always have to lead to romance. Yee gods my kingdom for an authentic and organic relationship in a Marvel film. A ""hero"" used to be a hero because he or she challenged our idea of the norm. In the modern superhero narrative this is no longer the case. They all have a little something for everyone and a lot of nothing for all. Need a bland romantic lead? Never fear ""The Wolverine"" has you covered. How about some pointless action beats? Oh yeah look no further. What about six or seven scenes where you just know Logan has no chance hes doomed only they refuse to roll the end credits. Whats that? He somehow survived? These story features are more in a long line of ""all is lost"" moments put there not because they tell the story but only to prolong the running time (while giving the characters something to do). Where have all the real heroes gone? Are we a movie-going public that must accept stories without edge released into theaters only to set up the next part of the story always promising the ""good"" film is right around the corner (the next battle chapter invariably teased during a vanilla post-credits stinger)? If were to reclaim the superhero genre we must demand that story come first that chances are taken and that the claws of our protagonists are sunk deeply into lush world-building. SCORE 3.1 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and has seen an actual wolverine in the wild.

(Ben Rothstein) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Wednesday July 24 2013 1200 AM Title The Wolverine Film Info With Hugh Jackman The clawed mutant hero fights an evil dynasty in Japan. Director James Mangold (209). PG-13 Extreme comic-book violence. At area theaters in 3-D where available. Opens Thursday night. In a summer of seemingly ageless superheroes Wolverine stands alone. Unlike Superman the Lone Ranger Capt. Kirk and Mr. Spock this eternally young mutant has  been played by only one actor Hugh Jackman. Good thing the Aussie star has the role down to a science since the rest of  ""The Wolverine"" is a howler. Jackman rolled out Wolverine in 2000s ""X-Men."" In 2009 ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" was all backstory forcing this new flick to follow-up 2006s ""X-Men The Last Stand."" (You need to have mutant powers to keep it all straight.) A prelude shows the stogie-chomping bone-clawed mutant known as Logan helping a Japanese soldier survive the atomic blast at Nagasaki. Then we flash-forward to the present day with Logan living in the Yukon to escape his memories of having killed his true love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen who cameos here as a ghostly vision from beyond). Rila Fukushima as Yukio in ""The Wolverine."" (Ben Rothstein) Then a mysterious woman Yukio (Rila Fukushima) finds him to say the now-aged soldier he saved in 1945 is on his deathbed and wants to see him. Once there Logan gets embroiled in a melodrama involving the Yakuza the snake-like mutant Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) the old soldiers family and a plan to steal Logans fast-healing power. Jackman like Sean Connery after six turns as James Bond wears Logan like a second skin -- his scowl alone says a thousand words. Logan is both the ultimate X-Man and the audiences stand-in and Jackman never loses sight of either side of his signature role. Its put to best use in a scene where he has to extract a weapon from his own heart. Unfortunately the rest of the film becomes standard slice-and-dice all the way to the ridiculous ending involving a baddie in adamantium armor. Director James Mangold (""Heavy"" ""Walk the Line"") deals with human-scale emotions and as much as he and the screenwriters try theres a constant battle between Jackmans wounded mutton-chopped masculinity and the requisite silliness of a superhero flick. They never gel. The claws come out more than once for Logan (Hugh Jackman) in ""The Wolverine."" (Ben Rothstein) Theres the usual villain problem (too many of them -- and none of them memorable) and a tone that may take parents of young Wolverine fans by surprise In the first 10 minutes alone a nuke goes off Jean is gored by Logan in a dream and someone gets an arrow through the hand. This is comic-book stuff for adults not kids. Wolverine himself remains a haunted figure -- lonely as a werewolf deadly as Clint Eastwoods Man With No Name -- but theres only so much sympathy we can give him. He thinks hes out and people obsessed with mutants pull him back in. Then he snarls theyre gored and were bored. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs.-Sun on New Yorks WOR 710-Am and at wor710.com.

"Review Wolverine almost gets its claws into heros soul - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Wolverine almost gets its claws into heros soulBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 07/24/2013 111905 AM PDTUpdated 07/25/2013 023219 PM PDT PHOTO GALLERY gt; View more images in this slideshow  | Mercury News Media Center Related StoriesJul 23Hugh Jackman calls Wolverine a career-defining roleFor a sturdy 90 minutes one of Marvel comics most intriguing creations is served well by director James Mangolds ""The Wolverine.""The popular X-Men teammate with the razor claws scalding temper and deep-seated angst is presented with a substantial story line one that at least initially prefers character and narrative depth over nonstop action. In its opening moments ""The Wolverine"" also known as Logan-- with Hugh Jackman reprising a role that fits him as snugly as his undershirt -- manages to wash away the stain of 2009s misguided mess of a first solo set piece ""X-Men Origins -- Wolverine.""This more focused more dark-hued narrative gets its creative spark from a Frank Miller/Chris Claremont 1980s comic series which refreshingly uproots our depressed half-man/half-beast from his woodsy Canadian environs and sends him to Japan. Saddled with a reality he hates and living for the dreams in which he meets up with dead paramour Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) Wolverine spends much of his time stuck between the bottom of a bottle and despair. The juicy role once again gives Jackman an opportunity to show off his acting chops as well as his preposterously buff body.Advertisement Wolverines wallowing ways change however when the tough magenta-haired Yukio (Rila Fukushima) comes calling at the behest of Kenuichio Harada (Will Yuen Lee) a wealthy dying man whose life Wolverine saved during the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. Shaggy and shabby Wolverine arrives in Tokyo and is plunked into dangerous family politics and drama that have an Akira Kurosawa/Shakespearean feel to them.The fresh setting and family feuding serve the Wolverine saga well and set the stage for a well-defined culture clash. Those two elements are gracefully woven together by screenwriters Mark Bomback (""Live Free or Die Hard"") and Scott Frank (""Marley amp; Me"") when Wolverine becomes involved with granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) a target of the yakuza and others after her granddad dies. At this point its a story that plays into hefty themes of mortality even suicide.But those higher ideals never get fully realized. While director Mangold (""Walk the Line"") handles the drama with ease hes less assured with the action sequences; no huge surprise considering his resume. But while a brawl atop a bullet train does have its exciting moments the 3-D makes it look phony and ridiculous. In fact the 3-D here is unwarranted. Save your money.The ending is even more problematic shifting into superhero mode as if on autopilot and trying for a surprise that is anything but.True to form in Marvel movies theres a worthwhile extra bit as the credits roll so stay in your seats. That one little teaser -- to the upcoming ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" movie -- whets our appetite for something better on the horizon and gives us hope.Is it possible one day Hollywood will grab Wolverine by the scruff of the neck and give him the stand-alone movie he deserves? Hard to say for sure but at least ""The Wolverine"" moves that idea forward in a promising trajectory.THE Wolverine   1/2Rating PG-13 (sequences of intense sci-fi action and violence some sexuality and language)Cast Hugh Jackman Rila Fukushima Tao Okamoto Will Yun Lee Famke JanssenDirector James MangoldRunning time 2 hours 16 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the last; Deadwood movie still on trackReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Now heres a comic-book movie. In a summer thats delivered one overstuffed Phase Two sequel and a bloated reboot designed to establish a whole new universe of interconnected franchises The Wolverine has a self-contained efficiency thats hard to resist. Though technically the second solo outing for everyones favorite razor-clawed reluctant team player--the less said about X-Men Origins Wolverine the better--the film rarely feels like a sequel. Nor is it a prequel or an origin story; it doesnt payoff prior installments or set up future ones but seems to exist almost out of time for the simple quaint purpose of pitting its iconic mutant superhero against samurais ninjas and vicious yakuza thugs. Remember in X2 when Wolvie went berserk on an invading task force? The Wolverine takes that moment and stretches it out across a two-hour timeframe adding an Eastern flavor and a more formidable army of expendable foes. Theres a whiff of the mythic to this Japan-set adventure beginning with the monolithic singularity of its title--think the Batman--and extending to its portrayal of the erstwhile X-Man as a wandering ageless ronin searching for the meaning of his ceaseless existence. After a spectacular prologue set during the bombing of Nagasaki The Wolverine leaps to present day; here Logan (Hugh Jackman looking properly grizzled under a mountain of untamed facial hair) lays low in the wilderness having taken a vow of nonviolence. ""Yeah right"" fans might rightfully scoff and sure enough it isnt long before the one-time Weapon X is meting out poetic justice to an unethical hunter. That inciting incident is straight out of Chris Claremont and Frank Millers original Wolverine miniseries which sent the fighting Canuck to the land of the rising sun to tangle with swordsmen. Following suit The Wolverine finds its eponymous brute summoned to Tokyo by an old acquaintance an elderly man (Will Yun Lee) whose obsession with Logans seeming immortality sets the somewhat-perfunctory plot into motion. In pure narrative terms what follows is fairly underwhelming Wolverine gets mixed up in a family feud and ends up playing bodyguard to the old mans docile delicate granddaughter (Tao Okamoto). Years and miles removed from his superpowered teammates Jackmans tortured protagonist often looks like the only interesting personality onscreen; even the villains including a venomous femme fatale (Svetlana Khodchenkova) seem like placeholders. Yet as a showcase for the charms and ruthless talents of the titular hero The Wolverine gets the job done. Over the course of five movies--six if you count his brilliant one-line cameo in First Class--Jackman has made this character his own. Here he plays Logan as both a comically gruff fish-out-of-water and a warrior wearied by the burden of his sins. (Famke Janssens slain Jean Grey appears to him in dreams doling out a beyond-the-grave guilt trip.) Mostly however Logan remains a man of action and the film has great fun throwing waves of new challenges at him. The scripts most inspired idea arriving early in the film is to rob the mutant of his uncanny healing abilities. Far from rendering him ineffectual Superman 2-style this vulnerability only seems to enhance his machismo cool He takes bullets like a champ limps into battle and--in the films most giddily masochistic scene--turns his fearsome claws on himself. Improbably sitting at the helm of this solid action distraction is James Mangold a Hollywood hireling whose prior forays into genre cinema--the Tom Cruise vehicle Knight And Day the toothless remake of 310 To Yuma--scarcely suggested a gift for splash-panel spectacle. Yet the setpieces including an astounding skirmish atop a speeding bullet train possess a kinetic grace largely absent from this seasons other big-budget offerings. Mangold brings style but not substance which isnt so fatal for a late-summer pulp blockbuster though the director oversold--in pre-release interviews--the supposed influence of his cinematic heroes. (There are few traces of Tokyo Story in this Tokyo story.) Truly great comic-book adaptations require a visionarys touch; one can only imagine what an auteur like Darren Aronofsky who was originally attached to direct would have done with the material. But it would be foolish to undervalue a superhero film that feels so untethered so free of the duties of franchise-building. Blessedly The Wolverine is not a preview for next summers X-Men movie--that is of course until the obligatory preview for next summers X-Men movie. These days being completely self-contained is a luxury comic-book movies rarely possess.

One month after Steven Spielberg and George Lucas predicted an ""implosion"" of the Hollywood industry the moment may have arrived even sooner than they anticipated. Doom and gloom reports of studio box office duds in recent weeks suggest that the proliferation of overpriced undercooked tentpole releases has reached another breaking point. Dispatches from Comic-Con report of a general fatigue among conventioneers faced with endless previews of the same half-baked formulas devoid of original concepts. While frugal directors and producers working outside this playing field relish in the schadenfreude disoriented moguls perplexed by their current situation might want to spend the weekend contemplating it in the context of Hollywoods latest -- and mercifully watchable -- product ""The Wolverine."" The latest edition to Foxs ever-expanding X-Men empire resurrects its most appealing character for another dreary solo entry in which the adamantium-riddled mutant with knives in his knuckles gets yanked away from sulking in the countryside to confront another demon from his past. Building on the brooding atmosphere capably established by Gavin Hood in 2009s ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" James Mangold delivers an efficiently brutal and straight-faced action-adventure once again showcasing Hugh Jackmans trademark scowl in the role he was born to play. Paying respectable tribute to Western motifs and most obviously samurai movies ""The Wolverine"" follows a thin story involving the aspirations of a rich Japanese investor whom the Wolverine aka Logan saved back in WWII. In awe of Logans regenerative abilities the dying man tracks down Logan decades later in the hopes of swiping his abilities aided by a life-sucking evil mutant played with bland sultriness by Svetlana Khodchenkova. Logan goes on the lam with the investors granddaughter (Tao Okamoto) and the future-seeing hired gun tasked with bringing him east (Rila Fukushima). In the midst of all this Mangold stages a terrific high velocity showdown between Logan and an unnamed assailant on top of Japans famed bullet train but other than that scene and a comically abrupt burst of violence involving a high rise a little further down the line ""The Wolverine"" has the sterile feel of a movie weighed down by its humorless character. We expect as much from him but theres a sense of lethargy to the very plot of ""The Wolverine"" as it barrels toward an uninspired final act. Yet in the context of so much public grousing over the current state of the business ""The Wolverine"" offers a provocative analogy for Hollywoods boundless commitment to pricey undertakings. Hiding in the forest as the movie begins still burnt by the loss of his former love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen surfacing in dream sequences) Logan is an unkillable action hero in denial about his fate. Dragged back into the field against his will his constant frustrations over being thrust into another showdown play as though hes actively trying to evade participating in another ""Wolverine"" movie. But the movie gods have other plans. ""Your mistake was to believe a life without end can have no meaning"" hes told. ""It is the only life that can."" That notion persists so heavily that eventually it washes over Logan until he has no choice but to play along. ""Im a soldier"" he finally declares. ""Ive been hiding too long."" A final coda teasing the next ""X-Men"" movie ensures that he wont have much time to reconsider. In ""The Wolverine"" Logan persists as a great idea the happy medium between Rambo and the man with no name  -- but the movie itself lacks the same complex inspiration. Looking at a large quantity of misconceived Hollywood movies it seems as though the strength of a few promising variables early on trounce the bigger picture. Hulking monsters versus machines in ""Pacific Rim"" new age ghostbusters in ""R.I.P.D."" speeding snails in ""Turbo"" a dystopian survival story in ""After Earth"" These are not cheap endeavors. Before executives take out their checkbooks they need to consider whether a seemingly marketable concept actually has legs or merely the sketchy outlines of them. Otherwise theyll face yet another summer of many Wolverines slashing their claws at interchangeable targets that will never truly fall.

Reply Coty May 12 2016 137 pm Most executives dont read the scripts they just read the log line and rely on comments from their interns or assistants coverage reports. Stories start as ideas but at studios they stay as ideas. Marketing PR and advertising take up most of the studio positions while story analysts and professional readers barely exist. Studios focus on what worked in the past instead of creating new ideas because they have investors that need analytics and data. Something that hasnt been done before doesnt have the same assurances as something that has. It makes it harder to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in a film with no guarantees. But usually if a movie tanks they say they marketed it wrong and move on to the next one. An often overlooked element to why these films tank is the availability of movies. Audiences now have unlimited access to content and have higher standards for what they are willing to see at theaters. It has to be worth putting on pants for.

Moments in ""The Wolverine"" rank among both the franchises best and worst but theres enough in the positive column to make the movie a must for fans and entertaining viewing for casual observers. This time around we find Logan hiding out in the Yukon wilderness haunted by both the loss of his beloved Jean Grey (Famke Janssen who turns up throughout as a ghostly presence) and his survival of the nuclear blast at Nagasaki where Logan was being held captive at the bottom of a deep well in a Japanese POW camp. On that fateful day he saved the life of soldier Yashida (Ken Yamamura). Now in the present day a dying Yashida -- who has become a powerful electronics magnate in Japan -- has summoned Logan to his deathbed ostensibly to say goodbye but actually to offer Logan the opportunity to pass his immortality along to Yashida so that the tormented Logan can find the death he craves. See video Joss Whedon Spills Avengers Age of Ultron Clues - Its Own Story Logan turns down the offer but soon finds himself enmeshed in the Yashidas family drama; granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) has been chosen to inherit the company much to the fury of her father Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada). Meanwhile the elder Yashidas physician (Svetlana Khodchenkova) lurks about with intent and it becomes apparent that she intends to take away Logan/Wolverines regenerative powers whether or not he wants to surrender them. ""The Wolverine"" works best in the scenes between Logan and Mariko -- readers of the original Marvel Comics know the key role she plays in his life although they may be surprised that the big-screen Logan speaks not one lick of Japanese -- and when the Wolverine fights side by side with psychic Yukio (Rila Fukushima) an impoverished orphan adopted ""Wuthering Heights""-style as a young girl to be a companion for Mariko. Also read 7 Bright Spots to End a Crowded Messy Summer at the Movies Yukios fighting style to say nothing of her cherry-Kool-Aid bangs and striped ensembles will no doubt make her a favorite of the cosplay set and newcomer Fukushima makes an immediate impression more than holding her own opposite veteran Jackman who can do the Wolverine squint-and-grunt on auto-pilot by this point. Alas ""The Wolverine"" gets too distracted by corporate intrigue Yashidas diabolical plans and the villainy of the doctor; none of that stuff is as compelling as the two female leads particularly since Khodchenkova gives a singularly flat performance. I cant remember a less engaging villain in contemporary superhero cinema. Screenwriters Scott Frank and Mark Bomback seem to be working off a checklist of Cool Japan Stuff Before the movie is over we get bullet trains ninjas pachinko parlors and love hotels. (Maybe the DVD extras will include deleted scenes featuring harajuku girls and panty-vending machines.) See video Wolverine Vine Tweaser 6 Short Seconds of Hugh Jackman One Big Reveal For every good idea theyve got (that bullet train fight sequence is breathtakingly exciting) the writers too often falter larding the script with too many characters and clumsily forcing people to define words like ""ronin"" and ""yakuza"" in conversation even when the other person would clearly already know the meaning. Still in the final wash ""The Wolverine"" provides a compelling look into a beloved screen character and offers up enough excitement to merit its existence. (Make sure to stick around after the credits for a glimpse at where the ""X-Men"" movies are going next.) Also read Hugh Jackman Bringing One-Man Show to L.A. for MPTF Benefit It may not make the case that Logan merits his own solo projects but it will scratch your X-itch until the next big-screen mutant adventure comes along.

In 2009 X-Men Origins Wolverine excavated the backstory of the deathless blade-fingered brute but was received with enough indifference to send Hollywood scuttling into reboot mode. With jack-of-all-trades director James Mangold (Girl Interrupted Knight and Day) now in charge Wolverine has gained a definite article but little else. This turgid return papers over the previous films narrative but creates little in the way of a fresh character arc. A World War II-set prologue sees Wolverine escape from a prisoner of war camp while Nagasaki gets nuked in the background - setting the taste level for the rest of the film. Fast-forward 70 years to find him camping in the Canadian wild bonding with grizzlies while his dead girlfriend Jean (Famke Janssen) breathily haunts him from the beyond. Thats going nowhere so its back to Japan where a past acquaintance has a score to settle. Our hero is swiftly inveigled into a countrywide chase to protect comely heiress Mariko (Tao Okamoto) from sundry yakuza a viperish - literally - vixen and this summers second sword-wielding robot. Its the stuff of Saturday-morning cartoons but Mangold - who as in the appalling Knight and Day edits all action sequences on the shaky frappe setting - hasnt the visual pop or lightness of touch to make it bounce. Jackman meanwhile acts strictly from his chest outwards evidently saving energy for his seventh appearance as Wolfie in next years all-too-aptly titled X-Men Days of Future Past.

Direction and music are good too. However the plot is inconsistent fights lack blood and the climax is not impressive. Origins was certainly better thanks to the antagonism between Logan and Creed and the cool battles of super heroes and villains. http//argonautis.eu/wolverine.htm FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 26 2013kerryFeatured... I found the film more watchable than the review above would suggest but agree that pace and pop is missing. Comic book noir? However there are a number of genuinely cool moments notably trying to tie together Wolverine Origins and X3. The tension developed by making the usually unstoppable main character physically vulnerable for the first time ever was well done and made me fear for him - a new experience for me. I didnt see it in 3D and since most of the film is dimly lit I dont believe I missed much. If the comparsion is useful to anyone I enjoyed Origins more than The Wolverine.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/london/film/the-wolverine?intcid=leader,200,thewolverine42,thewolverine,timeout

Though Wolvie comes across a bit world-weary and battle-worn by now Jackman is in top form taking the opportunity to test the characters physical and emotional extremes. Fans mightve preferred bigger action or more effects but Mangold does them one better recovering the soul of a character whose immortality left something to be desired.This story first appeared in the July 30 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Though the majority of the Marvel portfolio belongs to Disney these days Fox still controls the rights to the Fantastic Four Wolverine and his X-Men brethren. While hardly on par with Christopher Nolans ""Batman Begins"" trilogy this movie represents Foxs attempt to repair damage done to the most iconic of those characters by Gavin Hoods silly ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" solo outing (which didnt hurt the box office but weakened audiences faith in how he might subsequently be treated onscreen). With Wolverines backstory clearly established screenwriters Mark Bomback and Scott Frank are free to indulge an atmospheric one-off returning to the characters doomed romance with Mariko Yashida a member of a powerful Japanese clan -- the fan-favorite story arc cooked up by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller back in 1982. Set sometime after the events of ""X-Men The Last Stand"" the film opens with Jackmans Logan sulking somewhere in the Yukon wilds. Having sworn off his violent ways he identifies more with a feral grizzly than with any of the sport hunters he encounters in town setting up concerns (whether he can overcome his animal nature) and symbols (including a poisoned-tipped arrow) that resurface later in significant ways. When careless humans kill the bear Wolverine flies off the handle only to be rescued by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) a triangle-faced pixie with red-velvet hair who whisks him away to Japan where a character from Logans past wants to relieve him of his mutant healing ability. Saved from the atomic blast that destroyed Nagasaki Kenuichio Harada (Will Yun Lee) craves the immortality that Wolverine considers his curse and suggests a trade that would allow him to reunite with Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who appears to him in visions and represents a poetic connection to past films. It takes more than half an hour for ""The Wolverine"" to unleash its first action scene but when it comes the strike proves elegantly choreographed and worthy of the Hong Kong films that clearly inspired it as a squad of yakuza descend on Haradas funeral attempting to assassinate his granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto). The next scene rivals any confrontation in recent Asian cinema as Wolverine combats a group of yakuza thugs atop a speeding bullet train and its a thrill to see Jackman adding these new fighting styles to his characters repertoire. Wolverine emerges victorious of course but with a crucial difference His self-suturing wounds no longer heal themselves. Haradas nurse (Svetlana Khodchenkova an award-winning Russian actress completely out of place here) has done something to impair Logans abilities. In the process the razor-clawed character goes from being merely cool to being actually interesting since theres a genuine risk that he could die and/or be overpowered while trying to protect Mariko. Wolverine bleeds. Even better than this newfound physical weakness is the emotional vulnerability ""The Wolverine"" allows Jackman to explore. Logans self-imposed isolation reveals unexpected new layers of his psychology and suggests that once these iconic characters have been established onscreen they can be fleshed out in standalone films just as seemingly non-plot-advancing episodes of ""The Sopranos"" or ""Breaking Bad"" deepen our understanding of those series complicated protagonists. As it happens ""The Wolverine"" boasts one of the best pulp-inspired scripts yet. Its still full of corny dialogue (you know those punchy one-liners conceived to fit in tiny talk bubbles above the characters heads) but theres a genuine elegance to the way it establishes Logans tortured condition and slowly brings the character around to recovering his heroic potential methodically setting up and paying off ideas as it unfolds. Of course a script is just a blueprint and its still up to Mangold and his team to pull it off. This is where ""The Wolverine"" falls shy of greatness despite terrific production values elegant storytelling and a sensational cross-cultural score from Marco Beltrami. Compared with other directors -- namely Nolan Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughn -- who have elevated the genre by bringing aspects of their own style to the table Mangolds approach is clean and correct but does nothing to advance the overall state of comicbook movies owing largely to how heavily he borrows from other helmers. Thankfully his references are relatively upscale ranging from an elegant ""Yojimbo""-like scene in which lone ronin Wolverine is outnumbered by ninjas to a ""Diamonds Are Forever"" nod involving an unforeseen swimming pool and he even convinced Jackman to channel some classic Clint Eastwood attitude in his wonderfully surly performance. Mangolds concept was clearly to make an Eastern Western where the setting is Japan and the adversaries wield samurai swords but the hero is fueled by true grit. Its a remarkably effective strategy right up until the end when the films finale suddenly feels indistinguishable from that of other superhero pics as Wolverine takes on two villains -- one CG Silver Samurai and the other a campily attired snake-like mutant named Viper who molts her skin mid-climax. Whereas the Japanese-ness of everything that came before brought a certain ""Kill Bill""-like novelty to the genre this metal-against-metal showdown seems disappointingly familiar and breaks the cardinal rule when dealing with this character that nothing is stronger than Wolverines claws except perhaps his spirit.

Ben Smith (Ben_Smith_123) says July 26 2013 at 749 am The Wolverine is an admirable attempt to use a multi-million dollar blockbuster as a character study but these two styles are constantly at odds and in the end prove mutually detrimental. My review http//www.shelfheroes.com/2013/07/the-wolverine.html Reply Jonathon Miller says July 25 2013 at 958 am Fox no longer have the rights to Daredevil. Id suggest you do your research. Its not hard - Nikki Finkes sit covered it reasonably extensively. Add to that the ""two hands"" moment in the finale is garbage. The idea of Silver Samurais weapon makes sense in the comic but the way it was utilised here is nonsensical. The Wolverine is exactly why filmmaking-by-committee is proven time and time again to be a failure. Then again would anybody go and see a less splashy version of The Wolverine focussing more on the Japanese side of the story than the shoe-horned in mutant co-stars if it cost 60M instead of 125M? Reply Stephen Todoro says July 24 2013 at 1217 am Nerds. All of you... D Reply Sean says July 23 2013 at 925 pm Daredevils rights belong to Disney not Fox Peter Reply Peter Owens says July 23 2013 at 539 pm The Silver Samurai was not a full CG. It was beautifully crafted by the props makers in Sydney from scratch. Reply Dan says July 23 2013 at 1113 am Youve got film characters confused.... its not Harada but Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) in your plot summary that wants Wolverines immortality... Reply Ian T. says July 23 2013 at 1035 am Matthew Vaughn???? He hardly elevated the genre...nor did Variety think so when reviewing his decidedly pedestrian contributions. Its fine not to be a comic fan but it might help to be better grounded in movies. Maybe its time for Brian Lowry to review all comic-book adaptations... Reply Everton Carter (therealeverton) says July 23 2013 at 1054 am X-Men  First Class is considered to be one of the best comic book/Super hero films ever made. Thats fairly common knowledge too.Also at least one Variety reviewer (Chang) gave First Class a positive review. Ditto Kick-Ass so Im not sure what youre on about here at all...??? Reply What the Hell??? says July 23 2013 at 1030 am SPOILER ALERT? Reply LOgan JJ says July 23 2013 at 927 am I totaly agree the movie preview written by Peter Debruge. Hugh Jackman is indeed a awsome and brilliant actor plus also the most suitable man to play the role wolverine.Hope the box office of this movie wil be a boom  Reply Hue says July 23 2013 at 920 am Daredevil actually reverted back to Marvel (Disney) and is no longer owned by Fox. Reply Jon Kanders says July 23 2013 at 847 am ""genuine risk that he could die"" sigh. no there isnt. Reply Everton Carter (therealeverton) says July 23 2013 at 808 am Also Fox lost the rights to Daredevill a while ago. The ""only"" have the mutats now bt there are a LOT of X-Men/Mutant related comics and they were for well over a decade the highest selling comics by a distance. Starting with X-Men Days of Future Past (which has a tease at the end of the credits to this film) and then X-Force (at one time a government controlled alternative to The X-Men and latterly a ""wet-works"" black ops division; Fox are trying to build their own interconnected version of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With Mark Millar helping (assuming he still is I may have missed hat) they would seem to be on the right course for a slightly lesser Fox Cinematic Mutant Universe. Reply Tony says July 23 2013 at 840 am The government sponsored (lets not say controlled) alternative to the X-Men was X-Factor not X-Force. Reply Everton Carter (therealeverton) says July 23 2013 at 1042 am Youre right I made a big mistake there and my memory loss must be worse than I thought. thanks for pointing that out mate. Herbie J Pilato says July 23 2013 at 804 am Dude Carter youre incorrect. The Hulk was played by a THIRD actor in The Avengers Reply Everton Carter (therealeverton) says July 23 2013 at 812 am Youre incorrect I said very clearly that Mark Ruffalo was cast in The Avengers. What he wasnt was MARVELs third actor for the role he was MARVELs SECOND casting. Ed Norton was first then Mark Ruffalo was second. Eric Bana was cast by Universal in a Universal film. Just like Chris Pine wasnt Gene Roddenberrys second actor cast to play James T Kirk even though he was the second actor to play that character (officially) You need to read the whole of what I said again as you clearly missed the salient point. Reply Everton Carter (therealeverton) says July 23 2013 at 801 am Research / knowledge? ""The Marvel team has recast the Incredible Hulk three times in recent years"" No they have not. Universal made Hulk and cat it in 2003. They messed up and gave the rights back to Marvel . Marvel Studios then attempted to repair the damage done to the character by Universals Hulk. They needed him NOT to be a character that would make some people pass on going to an Avengers film. So then Marvel cast their FIRST actor in the role of Hulk Edward Norton. then there were disagreements between Norton and Marvel Studios and they cast their SECOND actor in the role Mark Ruffalo. So Marvel have cast TWo actors as Bruce Banner/ The Hulk not THREE. As for Wolverine Jackman plays the big screen version of him very well. Yes technically he is wrong for the part being about 27cm too tall (62 instead of 53) but he does own it especially when the writers and directors give him something worthwhile to do. Reply Herbie J Pilato says July 23 2013 at 758 am Whats this ""With"" stuff in the credits with regard to the actors? Ok maybe ""Starring"" is a bit indulgent....but how bout ""Featuring""?

Daily Edition Login to download The Wolverine Film Review 1200 PM PDT 7/21/2013 by Megan Lehmann FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Its a comic-book film but not as we know it. TWITTER Hugh Jackman takes his mutton-chopped mutant to Japan in James Mangolds standalone ""X-Men"" spinoff co-starring Famke Janssen Hiroyuki Sanada Tao Okamoto and newcomer Rila Fukushima. Director James Mangold brings a furrowed-brow solemnity to the comic-book world of The Wolverine the sixth big-screen outing for Marvels blade-fisted antihero and one that scratches and claws against the law of diminishing returns always destined to beset the splintering X-Men franchise. As a follow-up of sorts to an origin story spun off from a trilogy Foxs 3D summer tentpole is despite its obvious ambition hardly a game-changer. Coming on the heels of the woebegone shambles that was X-Men Origins Wolverine (which still managed to earn more than 373 million worldwide) it is however a step forward for Hugh Jackmans scowly mutton-chopped mutant who here finds himself wrestling with his inner demons and a cavalcade of ninjas and inked-up yakuza in modern-day Japan. VIDEO The Wolverine Trailer Badder Grittier Angrier Dialing back the city-razing CG mayhem of recent superhero fare in favor of more grounded action this noir-ish unusually intimate take still has the requisite sockadelic set pieces to guarantee an adamantium-plated hit upon its global rollout beginning July 24. It opens in the U.S. July 26. Mark Bomback and Scott Franks screenplay follows Chris Claremont and Frank Millers popular Japan-set comic-book arc from 1982 but Mangold (Walk the Line 310 to Yuma) seeks to distance his film from those pulpy beginnings by embedding his protagonist in a conventional near bromidic drama of familial squabbling corruption and corporate greed. Until a third act that collapses in a harebrained heap the director largely succeeds in keeping the more cartoonish aspects at bay roughing up the surface with organically staged fight scenes and crucially raising the stakes by stripping his hitherto indestructible hero of his self-healing powers. Figuratively declawed the Wolverine stumbles and bleeds that intricately sculpted (and frequently shirtless) body weakened and hurting in tune with his inner torment. Eternitys a curse for Logan/the Wolverine (Jackman) who following the dissolution of the mutant ensemble in 2006s X-Men The Last Stand has let himself go living ""hirsutely"" in the Canadian mountains with only a separated-at-birth grizzly bear for company. He is haunted by the memory of being forced to kill his Phoenix-possessed former lover Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who is clad in a diaphanous negligee as she appears to Logan in a series of unfortunately cheesy dream sequences. But an unexpected offer to relieve him of his immortality appears like a kindness. Bringing this proposal from the former Japanese soldier whose life Logan saved at the end of World War II is a cool-kid emissary in the form of cherry-haired Yukio (Japanese fashion model Rila Fukushima). PHOTOS 10 Top Summer Superheroes Movies Of All Time Battle of Box Office Brawn Yukio a katana-wielding assassin with her own intriguing backstory accompanies Logan to Tokyo where he meets his would-be benefactor Lord Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) now an elderly mega-rich industrialist who doesnt want to die. Logan gets a makeover (hes shaved scoured and disinfected in one of the films random stabs of eccentric humor) and catches the eye of Yashidas comely granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto). Soon theyre on the run from an assortment of villains with unclear motives as Mangold unfurls an elaborate plot involving Marikos crime-boss father (Hiroyuki Sanada) and his yakuza henchmen a mysterious ninja army and a slinky mutant named Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova from Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) who kills with a poisoned kiss in a passe throwback to Batmans nemesis Poison Ivy. Shifting the action to Japan is an inspired move for a film that aims to be a standalone enterprise. Not only does it distance itself from the critically mauled X-Men Origins Wolverine dropping the ""X-Men"" from the title frees Mangold from many of the constraints of sequel-making and prevents the scattered focus that would accompany a multimutant world. Its chancy though filling a summer blockbuster with predominantly non-American actors and even having some of them speak subtitled Japanese. But the Far East setting repays the productions faith. PHOTOS The Scene at Comic-Con 2013 Mangold with director of photography Ross Emery and production designer Francois Audouy creates an atmosphere of rather lovely asceticism rare for the genre. The cinematography is crisp and often beautiful combining the latest digital technology with old-school lenses to achieve a classic look as heavy-duty themes of vengeance and redemption immortality and loss play out in rural ryokans and against neon-lit cityscapes. The postproduction conversion to 3D adds little. As well as permitting a riff on the parallels between Jackmans mutant warrior and a feudal-era ronin a samurai without a master or a cause to fight for the exotic locale lifts the Wolverine out of his comfort zone forcing him to navigate a strange land with strict codes of honor and a strong sense of tradition and custom. Best of all Mangold uses the occasion to give a distinctly Japanese twist to the tried-and-true battle-atop-a-speeding-train -- in this case a bullet train -- hurtling along at 300 miles per hour. Its a bravura heart-in-mouth sequence expertly staged and theres plenty more goring and slashing where that came from as well as a spectacular Kurosawa-inspired scene in which Logan falls foul of several quivers full of arrows. PHOTOS Hugh Jackman An Unconventional Superstar Each fight propels the narrative along -- hows that for novel? -- although the PG-13 rating renders them weirdly bloodless and the climactic battle with the Silver Samurai is a giant letdown which may even provoke sniggers. Thirteen years after his mutant debut in Bryan Singers terrific X-Men Jackman also a producer here owns the Wolverine character. The charismatic Aussie has added some martial arts moves to his characters slice-and-dice repertoire is buffer than ever and shows no sign of flagging. A post-credits sequence teasing next years X-Men Days of Future Past has Fox execs betting fans interest wont diminish either.
