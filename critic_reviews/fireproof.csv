Mohammed ""Mo"" Amer and Azhar Usman make fun of themselves -- their wife and mother jokes are universal; much of their ethnic shtick could be Jewish or Italian -- and their situation. Amer bounds onstage expressing incredulity ""This is a lot of room for a Palestinian"" The heavily bearded Usman starts immediately with bin Laden jokes. Usman is less cautious than Amer -- a good vaudevillian he rags on Jews and Catholics as well as South Asians -- but he still stops well short of any irreverence. And Allah Made Me Funny is a relative concept Its obvious that Amer and Usman labor under the burden of making humor at once insider-cool and outsider-friendly. And its hard to finesse ""offensive"" from a defensive crouch. The most skilled comic of the three is the nation of Islam convert Bryant ""Preacher"" Moss who not only evokes Saddam Hussein but goes on to imagine him as a black man in court arguing with the judge. ""The U.S. is scared by two things"" Moss riffs. ""I got the best of both worlds."" Hes completely self-referential. Perhaps self-satirizing his faith will be next.(Sunset 5) (J. Hoberman) AN AMERICAN CAROL In this astonishingly inept alleged satire from director and co-writer David Zucker -- an even more virulent us-against-them jeremiad than Bill Mahers Religulous -- a bumbling trio of Islamic terrorists set off for America in search of a Hollywood director to help them make a recruitment video for suicide bombers. They find their white knight in slovenly Michigan-born documentary maker Michael Malone (get it?) whose credits include Die You American Pigs and No Country for Anyone and who in turn finds his latent patriotic impulses stirred by visits from the ghosts of JFK George S. Patton and George Washington (played I kid you not by Jon Voight). The jokes such as they are come at the expense of people named ""Mohammed"" or ""Hussein"" vegans homosexuals and pretty much anyone who dares to question authority. In the most grotesque musical number this side of From Justin to Kelly a chorus line of leering pot-smoking academics conflates higher learning with liberal brainwashing but its Zucker who is the real revisionist historian here equating peace negotiations with Appeasement; likening Moore/Malone (Kevin Farley) to Leni Riefenstahl; invoking the Civil War as an argument against pacifism. Theres been one razor-sharp cultural lampoon at the movies this year -- Adam Sandlers Dont Mess With the Zohan -- although Zuckers achievement may in fact be more remarkable. His movies level of political discourse makes Couric/Palin look like Frost/Nixon.  (Selected theaters) (Scott Foundas) GO  BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA Undersized lapdogs make me grumpy even when they dont talk wear pink booties and shop Rodeo Drive. So I came to Beverly Hills Chihuahua with poison pen at the ready -- only to be won over by the exuberant charms of Raja Gosnells comedy about a snobby privileged Chihuahua named Chloe (voiced by Drew Barrymore) and her similarly spoiled-rotten 90210 dog sitter (Piper Perabo). The twosome grow some backbone when they get lost in the bowels of Baja where the pooch must be rescued from the clutches of Mexican dogfight wranglers. If the studios are finally going to make their mark on Latino audiences they could do a lot worse than this wicked satire on Beverly Hills pet excess with its sharp script a fun performance by Jamie Lee Curtis as Chloes overindulgent owner and a mostly Spanish-speaking cast that includes Andy Garcia as a clapped-out police dog Cheech Marin as a cunning rat whos after Chloes Harry Winston collar and George Lopez as a Chihuahua from the wrong side of the tracks who loves Chloe. This being Disney wholesome character-building messages abound but for once theyre freshly spun as cautions against stereotyping both ethnic and canine. And if having seen Beverly Hills Chihuahua your children grow up without the desire to turn their pets into idiot fashion accessories or extensions of their own shopaholic fantasies so much the better.

Sep. 13 600pm GO  BLINDNESS The most recent example of bleak chic Fernando Meirelles mostly harrowing adaptation of Jose Saramagos international bestseller Blindness is unflinching at best and treacly at worst. Set in a gray and metallic modern metropolis (actually Sao Paolo mixed in with Montevideo and Toronto) the film like the novel opens with a man (Yusuke Iseya) in a car stopped at a traffic light who suddenly loses his vision. Another man (actor-screenwriter Don McKellar) who drives him home and later steals his car also falls prey to the mysterious ""white blindness"" as does the first victims doctor (Mark Ruffalo). Soon the entire human population finds itself engulfed in a milky sightlessness save inexplicably one the doctors wife (Julianne Moore). Meirelles working with his Brazilian cinematographer Cesar Charlone establishes the plagues outbreak with visual flair evoking the experience of the ivory blindness through blurry and brightly overexposed frames. Like Saramago Meirelles doesnt much care about the medical or psychological specifics of blindness nor is he interested in the fate of any one human but rather humanity as a whole. (Theres obviously a grand metaphor here -- people are ""blind"" -- but its pretty simplistic.) Panned in Cannes Blindness has since lost a reportedly ponderous voice-over spoken by Danny Glover who appears as a sagely old man with a none-too-subtle eye-patch -- undoubtedly a wise move. The movie is strongest when its not trying to say anything but instead conveying the sheer desperation of its characters. Blindness pulls the viewer into its nightmarish vision and dares us to watch how humankind -- at the level of both governments and individuals -- fails to cope in times of chaos. And considering the current headlines maybe thats insightful enough. (Citywide) (Anthony Kaufman)  GO  BOOGIE MAN THE LEE ATWATER STORY Just about everyone interviewed for Stefan Forbes fascinating documentary about Lee Atwater -- whether Democrat or Republican pols African-American bluesmen or hardened reporters -- ends anecdotes about the Republican strategists dirty tricks with a titter thats either nervous or ambivalently appreciative. Politically speaking it may be enough to know that Atwater who shamelessly drove race into the 1988 presidential campaign to destroy Michael Dukakis and win the election for George Bush Sr. was a disciple of Strom Thurmond got along like a house on fire with Bush Jr. and taught Karl Rove most of what he knows about exploiting media. But Forbes adroitly fills out his picture of this ""marsupial"" little man with ""the eyes of a killer"" through the testimony of those who admired and/or loathed Atwater. Less persuasive is Forbes perfunctory psychologically thin rummage through Atwaters childhood for a traumatic event that would explain his utter ruthlessness. He finds one but its much less interesting than the question of whether the blues-playing Southerner was a racist or merely a cynic or the films revelations about the ambiguities of Atwaters highly publicized remorse with hand on Bible as he lay dying (and largely ignored by the dynasty he had served so assiduously) of brain cancer. (Sunset 5) (Ella Taylor) FIREPROOF When Capt. Caleb Holt (Kirk Cameron) decides to divorce his Sarah Palin-type wife his bros at the firehouse come to his rescue with words of wisdom swiped from the annals of Hallmark ""You never leave your partner especially during a fire."" With advice like this its no wonder Caleb turns to Jesus. Naturally director Alex Kendricks style suggests a pharmaceutical commercial -- especially during scenes of Caleb and his father plodding through the woods toward a creepily and strategically placed cross -- because what is Fireproof selling if not a drug? But before it even mentions God the film works sweetly as a chronicle of a man trying to extend the courage he shows on the job to his marriage by following a 40-day experiment called ""The Love Dare"" which necessitates being kind to Catherine (Erin Bethea) and ultimately unkind to himself -- by giving up his dream of owning a boat and beating the shit out of his computer for teasing him with a pornographic pop-up ad. Then the film gets all religulous suggesting that Calebs devotion to healing means nothing without Jesus and so Fireproof stops becoming relatable to us all and only to the already or easily indoctrinated. (Selected theaters) (Ed Gonzalez) FLASH OF GENIUS The big-screen version of inventor Robert Kearns legal battles with Ford and Chrysler -- both of whom nicked his intermittent windshield wiper without giving him credit much less paying a cent -- is about as exciting as Kearns Wikipedia entry. Greg Kinnear usually kinetic is unusually (and unbearably) dull in producer turned director Marc Abrahams telling of Kearns years-long fight to regain his good name even as Ford finally offers millions to get him to scram. Is Kearns mad or just angry? Hard to say as the filmmaker and actor cant get a handle on a man obsessed with windshield wipers and the attendant credit thats rightfully his. The movies so even-keeled that the cast -- including Lauren Graham as the tolerant wife who suddenly snaps and then just vanishes altogether -- seems to be getting sleepy sleepy sleepy as it winds its way toward a courtroom showdown thats more slowdown. You know how itll all end -- Hollywood doesnt make movies in which Goliath trounces David especially when hes Greg Kinnear -- so all youre left with are windshield wipers going back and forth ... and back and forth ... and back and forth. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)  THE HOUSE OF ADAM Suspecting that hes being robbed the owner of a small-town diner asks his married son Anthony (John Shaw) to return from college to spy on his only employee Adam (Jared Cadwell). Within three minutes of screen time Anthony cuts himself in the kitchen Adam grinningly sticks the bloody finger in his mouth the two walk along babbling creeks together and Adam reveals -- as he has to nobody else -- that hes gay. Soon after Anthony cops to both the embezzlement and bi-curiosity his dying father entrusts his cabin to Adam and -- one year and a divorce later -- Anthony is Adams lover and a police detective. Then Adam is beaten to death with a Bible by beefcake religious fanatics enabling Anthony to move into the house -- now owned by another couple -- and find his beloveds remains. Jorge Ameers laughably unskilled drama (acting thats the opposite of natural confused music cues colors that dont match between each hideously framed shot production values rivaling late-night Cinemax softcore cheapies mildly supernatural events) is so poorly written and directed that it could be a fake movie within a John Waters camp classic. How else to explain such a waste of time escaping the LBGT-festival circuit? (Sunset 5) (Aaron Hillis) HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS AND ALIENATE PEOPLE Based on Toby Youngs tome about his spectacular fuck-ups and flame-out at Vanity Fair Robert Weides big-screen version is sitcom-drab. Simon Pegg plays Young reducing the writer -- in the book version a narcissistic twat who aspired to be Cary Grant in His Girl Friday sans the looks or talent -- to nothing more than a barely functioning idiot a cretin clad in a ""Young Dumb and Full of Come"" T-shirt whose loutishness is outmatched only by his inability to function as a human being. Worse the storys been turned into a romantic comedy in which Simon woos his considerably smarter though no less self-absorbed superior Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst) whos fucking an editor (Danny Huston) who seems to be speaking in four different accents at once none of them quite of the English variety. It plays like a made-for-CBS redo of The Devil Wears Prada which was likewise set at a Manhattan glossy but also happened to contain some genuinely insightful observations about the perils of workplace success. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky) MENTOR As aging novelist and graduate professor Sanford Pollard Rutger Hauer shares a vocation a shaggy gray haircut and a pair of tortoiseshell frames with the Michael Douglas character from Curtis Hansons Wonder Boys. Like Douglas Grady Tripp Pollard juggles relationships with his students carrying on a romantic liaison with the class assistant (Dagmara Dominczyk) while becoming guru to a talented young writer (Matt Davis). But whereas Douglass defining characteristic in Wonder Boys was his midlife fatigue Pollard is notable for his abusive mind games and penchants for cocaine and predatory sex. You didnt think they hired Rutger Hauer to play Mr. Chips did you? With Hauer as cruel ringmaster an erotic triangle develops and eventually it feels as if director David Carl Lang has welded the plot of Indecent Proposal onto Wonder Boys world of bourgeois academia. All the bedroom action apparently transforms Pollards young protege into a great novelist although Davis appears no less boyish and clueless at the end of the film than he does in the beginning. Lang tells us that hanging around someone like Pollard will turn you into a great writer but its hard to accept Hauer as anything other than a despicable prick. Mentor might have rung truer had it allowed Pollard to stay a monster rather than redeeming him in a predictably heartwarming climax. (Grande 4-Plex) (Sam Sweet) NICK amp; NORAHS INFINITE PLAYLIST Peter Solletts 2002 film Raising Victor Vargas remains among the most pointed poignant and joyful films about teen love ever made. Everything about it felt special from its depictions of the Lower East Side of Manhattan to its cast then-newcomers who seemed to radiate from within as they groped and coped beneath watchful eyes. Now Sollett can only retrace those footsteps in this far lesser movie about little more than a boy (Michael Cera once more in the Michael Cera role) a girl (Kat Dennings) and their friends cruising the streets of NYC in search of the latest greatest hippest band in all the land (a band we never see or hear incidentally which shorts the audience of at least one promised reward for making it to the movies end). From its indier-than-thou soundtrack -- larded with the likes of Vampire Weekend Bishop Allen and Band of Horses -- to its split-second hipster cameos (Devendra Banhart Seth Meyers John Cho Kevin Corrigan) this after-hours romantic comedy plays like the exact opposite of Victor Vargas Where that movie was organic with every scene hitting just the right note and feeling so magically accidental Nick amp; Norah is like something crafted in a lab by 54-year-old hucksters trying to sell shit to the kids under the cheerless guise of ""alternative."" The only thing its an alternative to? Good. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)  GO  OBSCENE Barney Rosset is a tragic hero. He says so himself at the end of Obscene stating -- by way of a colleagues parting shot -- what the previous 90 minutes of Neil Ortenberg and Daniel OConnors very fine documentary make unstintingly and yet wistfully clear. Beginning with Rossets 1989 appearance on a delightfully vulgar cable-access show and a question about how he managed to lose his publishing imprint Grove Press in an unexpectedly hostile buyout Obscene then reels back some 50 years tracing the Chicago origins of a kid who grew up to fight perhaps the preeminent publishing battle of the 20th century censorship. Much of the film and photographic material is culled from Rossets stunningly replete archives and an assortment of artists publishers and literati appears to champion and chide the man who first brought Lady Chatterleys Lover Tropic of Cancer and Naked Lunch to the starving bosoms of the American public. Having sold off every acre of his prime Hamptons real estate in an attempt to keep Grove afloat through the 60s instead of jillionaire-hood and publishing-board eminency the 86-year-old today settles for the modest life of a cult figure with some kick left; his lit-and-naked-ladies journal The Evergreen Review now exists online. (Sunset 5) (Michelle Orange) SMOTHER Noah (Dax Shepard) just got fired faces pressure from his wife (Liv Tyler) to have a baby and must contend with her socially inept cousin (Mike White) who wants to stay with them for a few days while he finishes his screenplay. Thats when Marilyn (Diane Keaton) Noahs high-maintenance mother announces shes moving in turning Noahs bad day into a presumably hilarious and awful one. Directed and co-written by Vince Di Meglio Smother aspires to an edgy style of non-sequitur humor where the situations arent particularly funny or original but do allow enough room for throwaway jokes and bizarre running gags. The problem with this flimsy narrative approach is that the films laugh quotient depends entirely on whatever the cast can bring to the tired setup. In that regard Smother is fortunate -- Shepard is dependably low-key White goes a long way with his creepy-smile stare and Keaton demonstrates boundless charm when she isnt restrained by the cliches of her nagging needy character. Still with its mixture of high-profile talent and low-watt comic inspiration Smother feels like the sort of misbegotten curiosity Comedy Central uses to fill its Sunday afternoon programming. And considering how quietly Smothers distributor dumped it into theaters expect to see it there soon. (AMC Burbank; One Colorado; Fallbrook 7) (Tim Grierson) GO  STILL LIFE More than two years after winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival one year after a single local screening during UCLAs annual showcase of new Chinese cinema and nine months after opening commercially in New York director Jia Zhangkes Still Life finally receives a full weeks run at one Los Angeles cinema. Set and shot in Fengjie a real Chinese town that was being dismantled and demolished as Jia was filming in 2006 to make way for the massive Three Gorges hydroelectric-dam project Still Life is the story of two people in transit -- a rural coal miner (Han Sanming) in search of the ex-wife and teenage daughter he hasnt seen in a decade and a woman (played by Jias frequent muse the luminous Zhao Tao) looking for her estranged engineer husband. The two story lines parallel one another without ever intersecting each of them affording Jia and his ace cinematographer Yu Lik Wai (shooting once again in crisp high-definition video) to commemorate the disappearing Fengjie landscape -- and with it a few thousand years of Chinese history -- in all its decrepit gutted-out majesty. Everywhere Jia looks he sees the clash between Chinas past and its rapidly accelerating present Men in hazard uniforms with spray cans make their zombielike way through the ruins. A demolition team unearths artifacts dating from the Han dynasty. A gutted building literally blasts off into the stratosphere like a rocket ship to the moon. Ive said before in these pages that Jia (whose previous films include The World Unknown Pleasures and Platform) is the greatest Chinese filmmaker of his generation. In Still Life his great subject -- that of a nation making ""progress"" faster than its own people can keep up with it -- reaches its fullest and most painfully beautiful expression yet. Simply one of the best films of last year this year or any year likely to come. (Music Hall) (SF)THE VIOLENT KIND In its attempt to convey the psychological unraveling of a soldier returning home from Iraq The Violent Kind forgoes narrative structure in favor of hallucinatory malaise. The action revolves around a cabin in Montana where Iraq veteran Terry Malloy (Kirk Harris) reunites with his Vietnam vet father (Jon Savage of The Deer Hunter) and attractive young wife (Irina Bjorkland). The nondescript wilderness symbolizes the netherworld in which both father and son find themselves trapped but over the course of the film the pattern of surreal and grotesque images -- a carcass floating in gray stew; a musical performance by robed white-faced phantoms -- feels less like a haunting and more like mumbo jumbo. Director Geoffrey Pepos wants to show that posttraumatic stress causes combat veterans to destroy themselves and the people they love but he has little interest in unpacking his characters war experiences beyond cliches. Terry Malloy (the allusion to On the Waterfront is both cheap and irrelevant) talks in voice-over about his experiences with ""his boys"" back in the platoon (""You gotta believe in the guy next to you ..."") while Dad brandishes guns at imaginary ""gooks."" Both men exist only as war-movie figments set adrift in a picture that confuses a chaotic psyche with what is simply chaotic filmmaking.

Steps like Order flowers for your estranged wife -- and good ones not a bargain bouquet. Make her dinner and light some candles. Accept Christ as your personal savior. And do the dishes once in a while will you? (In no particular order.) Fireproof is obviously critic-proof; though it hit theaters sans reviewer screenings it had been heavily screened for pastors who bought group tickets for their congregations ensuring plenty of sold-out opening-weekend showings. Can hundreds of thousands of multiplex-invading Promise Keepers be wrong? Dont answer that but let it first be said that Fireproof is a huge improvement on the two earlier films made by the Georgia pastor/filmmaker/brother team of Alex and Stephen Kendrick including 2006s prayer-wins-football-games hit the 10 million-grossing Facing the Giants. It helps that Alex Kendrick hasnt given himself the lead role in this one instead handing that assignment to Kirk Cameron the only pro among the movies otherwise all-local all-volunteer cast. The ex-child star nicely summons a manly vein-bulging rage in a few scenes maybe letting loose something pent up during all those years playing the milquetoast goodie in Left Behind sequels and Growing Pains reunion specials. Here Cameron plays a tantrum-throwing firefighter who is as he says a hero to everyone but his wife (Erin Bethea) a neglected ice princess whos tired of never knowing whether hubby will be home for dinner. When she pitches a breakup hes all too happy to oblige until his ministerial-sounding dad proposes a 40-day program to regrow their love. This woo-back scheme takes longer to succeed than youd expect in a Christian anti-divorce tract and forestalling the couples inevitable reconciliation proves both surprisingly realistic and (over a two-hour running time) enervating. Some of the tenser domestic moments will hit home with battle-scarred marrieds of any religious stripe and the couples problems are candid by evangelical feature standards although they hardly rate high on the secular dramaturgy scale Hes got an Internet porn habit and shes enjoying an unconsummated flirtation with a doctor at work. These are temptations faced by Christian and non-Christian couples alike but the filmmakers hedge their bets by making the young marrieds agnostic at the start of the movie in order to turn Fireproof into a manual for eternal as well as marital salvation. (""Im in"" Cameron announces to a spiritually mentoring firefighter pal.) You probably cant blame pastors moonlighting as moviemakers for wanting to pack their film with multiple messages but the conversion subplot feels shoehorned into the more crucial marital doings as if coming to Jesus might be just one of a long checklist of steps to restore sizzle to your marriage right between buying roses and preparing a candlelit dinner.

""The Love Dare"" its called.The screenwriters the brothers Alex Kendrick (who also directed) and Stephen Kendrick give the story some pull by not making Catherine into the usual neglected wallflower of a wife. Instead shes a publicist at a hospital who spends most of the film contemplating whether to hop into bed with one of the doctors.For two-thirds of the movie the filmmakers show a restraint rare in the movie-with-a-Message genre so much so that the two most appealing characters are those nudging Caleb toward Christianity (Mr. Malcom and Ken Bevel as a fellow firefighter).The story may be a bit gimmicky -- yes there are dramatic firefighter rescues that have little to do with the main plot -- and the central couple is thinly drawn. Its never clear what attracted these two to each other in the first place and the hard-edged Catherines inevitable coming-around hinges disappointingly on some simplistic sensitive-male displays. (He does the dishes) Photo Kirk Cameron plays a firefighter with a troubled marriage in ""Fireproof."" Credit Samuel Goldwyn Films But the cast of mostly amateurs (Mr. Cameron of ""Growing Pains"" being the exception) is surprisingly good. And the moments of comic relief are mildly amusing.Only at the end do the filmmakers get heavy-handed and they seem not to know when to wrap up letting the movie run on for several smarmy scenes beyond its natural endpoint. Until then though this is a decent attempt to combine faith and storytelling that will certainly register with its target audience.

As sincere uncynical and subtlety-free as a Sunday school lecture ""Fireproof"" is another aggressively inspirational drama from brothers Alex and Stephen Kendrick (""Facing the Giants"" ""Flywheel"") pastors at the Sherwood Church of Albany Ga. Produced like its predecessors for the churchs Sherwood Pictures unit with a largely volunteer cast (including top-billed Kirk Cameron) and crew the pic represents a notable uptick in tech values and narrative sturdiness for the filmmakers. The faithful may flock to megaplexes to generate modestly impressive B.O. but ""Fireproof"" likely will find its true calling as an instructional tool for moderators of faith-based marriage-counseling programs. Cameron is genuinely compelling as Caleb a work-obsessed firefighter on the verge of divorce from his neglected wife Catherine (Erin Bethea) a hospital PR rep. Calebs born-again dad (Harris Malcom) encourages his son to commit to ""The Love Dare"" -- not a TV gameshow as its name might imply but a 40-day Bible-inspired program designed to help spouses restore frayed ties. Initially however Catherine resists reconciliation. For one thing shes upset by Calebs habit of trolling Internet porn sites. (Not surprisingly the filmmakers are extremely discreet if not downright evasive in their handling of this plot wrinkle.) For another shes increasingly attracted to an attentive co-worker. Happily-ever-aftering is inevitable in this type of pic especially when characters rely heavily on the power of prayer. But the Kendricks test their auds patience by unduly delaying the feel-good payoff to Calebs ""Love Dare"" crusade. Betheas lack of acting experience is too obvious by half. But supporting players cast as Calebs firehouse buddies -- most of them nonpros -- provide snatches of welcome comic relief.
