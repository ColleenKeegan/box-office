But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Coyote duel in which the cheerful little beeper continually eludes the inept but monomaniacal chasings of the pursuing varmint. Another less often noted but more sober pop-cultural theme is Steven Spielbergs obsession with children (E.T. Empire of the Sun et al.) who as a result of either death or divorce are bereft of conventional parenting and wonder if they can successfully make it to maturity. It is the business of Catch Me If You Can to meld these two subgenres in a single film and see what happens -- which turns out to be very amusing. The movie follows the autobiography of Frank W. Abagnale Jr. a reformed con man. His parents separated when he was 14. Asked to choose one or the other to live with he couldnt make the choice so he skipped town for New York City. Looking older than his years he acquired a pilots uniform and a forged ID. He was soon afforded many boons -- free trips around the country girls (who flocked to this really cute guy in his fly-boy suit) and best of all the ability to cash fraudulent checks largely on the basis of his assured and glamorous presence. Before Abagnales career ended five years later -- the movie compresses the time frame -- he had also passed himself off as a doctor and lawyer and acquired 2.5 million in ill-gotten gains and the avid attention of the FBI which caught and imprisoned him. Here the film written with unforced ease by Jeff Nathanson and directed in the same graceful spirit by Spielberg makes its largest fictional leap; it conflates several FBI pursuers into one. But thats more than all right because Carl Hanratty is wonderfully played by Tom Hanks. He wears half-horn-rims and a dorky little hat speaks in a grating Boston accent and tends to spend his Christmas Eves at the office eating Chinese takeout and obsessing about Abagnale. Its a delicious comic portrayal though not more so than Leonardo DiCaprios charming impersonation of Abagnale which is simultaneously naive and knowing. Abagnales life is shadowed by his failed father (played with melancholic anger by a superb Christopher Walken) who had the spirit of a con artist but none of the breeds subtle skills. There is a happy ending which would be imprudent to reveal. Suffice it to say Abagnale was a smart cookie with the wit to see that his talents might have value in the straight world and the late-blooming moral intelligence not to take too much pride in his boyish exploits. As years passed he married had kids prospered and recognized that what he had done in his youth was not very nice to say the least. Abagnales story combined with Nathansons sensitivity to his family situation and Spielbergs interest in lost boys who manage to find their best selves results in about the nicest movie you could ask for at the holidays a gently funny sweetly adventurous film that makes you feel genuinely good that is to say entirely unconned by false sentiment or sharp overmanipulative Hollywood practices. --By Richard Schickel 25th HOUR STARRING Edward Norton Philip Seymour Hoffman Barry Pepper DIRECTED BY Spike Lee Halfway through his long days journey into night and day again Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) launches into a rant against New York ""F___ you and this city and everyone in it"" He spreads his venom ecumenically -- to the Pakistani cab drivers and the black schoolyard studs and the Soprano wannabes in Bensonhurst and to the Irish-American boyos of whom Monty is one. Its a swell swill of gutter poetry -- written by novelist-screenwriter David Benioff and vigorously illustrated in a tabloid-surrealist style by director Spike Lee -- that touches on everything New Yorkers and Americans love to hate about the big city. Aside from that Grucci Brothers skyrocket of invective 25th Hour is pretty lethargic stuff. Monty a convicted drug dealer on his last day before he is to report to prison does more moping than moving. The virtue of this brutal downer is on the edges in the evocation of New York after 9/11 depressed cratered postapocalyptic. The film suggests that Gothamites have been frozen in their tracks like emotional zombies waiting to see if the next attack can make them feel deader than they already do. --RC Previous Page 1 2 3 4 5 Next Page Home U.S. Politics World Business Tech Health Science Entertainment Newsfeed Living Ideas Parents Sports History The TIME Vault Magazine Subscribe Give a Gift TIME Shop Newsletters Customer Service Site Map Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights Terms of Use Advertising Ad Choices (c) 2016 Time Inc.

"25th Hour Stunningly True to Its Time washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On 25th Hour Stunningly True to Its Time Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday January 10 2003 Monty Brogan is a drug dealer. Recently pinched by the Drug Enforcement Administration he now faces a seven-year stretch in jail in Upstate New York and the day before hes to leave for prison he reevaluates his life by visiting old Manhattan haunts connecting with family and friends and speculating as to who set him up with the DEA. Spike Lees ""25th Hour"" follows Monty through this day-in-the-life one tinged with almost tragic fatalism He is convinced he wont survive in prison that young handsome men like him are walking targets for sexual predators and his terror leads him to consider suicide or running away forever from the life that hes built. Such is the premise of ""25th Hour"" a film that turns out to be much more than the sum of its parts. With supreme control and restraint -- two qualities the director hasnt always exhibited even in his finest work up to now -- Lee delves deeply into Montys shame and self-loathing his relationships with his father friends and lover and the existential dilemma of a man whose once bright future is now a bleak smudge in his mind. Suffusing the entire drama both as a backdrop and as the warp and weft of Montys guilt is the films setting of New York immediately following the events of Sept. 11 2001 -- a city knocked back on its heels in deep mourning and shock. Surrounded by the street reliquaries of flags and Xeroxed photographs that stood not just for death and suffering but for heroism and survival Monty feels that he has betrayed not only those he loves and his own promise but an entire city whose ruins surround him as a collective rebuke. Among its many artistic achievements ""25th Hour"" arrives as the ""Rome Open City"" of post-9/11 New York at once a neorealist small-scale drama in the tradition of Rossellini and De Sica and a movie that soars into dizzying visual heights. Like ""Gangs of New York"" to which it makes a perfect historical bookend ""25th Hour"" swings for the fences and just witnessing Lees assurance and courage in making it is as rewarding as the always absorbing results. Based on David Benioffs novel of the same name and adapted for the screen by the author ""25th Hour"" pulls off the extraordinary feat of making moviegoers identify with a morally corrupt protagonist without asking them to like him. Edward Norton delivers an unshowy but brilliantly calibrated performance as Monty who has slipped into dealing presumably as the path of least resistance. During brief flashbacks the audience sees that he conducted his business in the pseudo-friendly low-key way that allows dealers and users to believe theyre not hurting anybody least of all themselves. Also in denial are Montys beautiful girlfriend Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) his father James (Brian Cox) and his best friends Jakob (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Frank (Barry Pepper). Jakob who now teaches at the prep school the three friends attended has been too wrapped up in his own fears and obsessions -- currently having to do with a flirtatious student played by Anna Paquin -- to confront Monty on what he does for a living. Frank a stockbroker is more outright hostile Although he wants to be there for Monty on his last free night he admits that he thinks his friend deserves whats in store for him. Through its series of confrontations and encounters ""25th Hour"" examines the moral implications of Montys plight but often viewers find themselves listening in on banal barstool exchanges between young men -- about girls about money about sex and careers. Then just when the audience is lulled into thinking ""25th Hour"" is another quirky observant little movie about the way people behave Lee delivers a scene of breathtaking intensity. Montys visit to the bathroom of his fathers saloon ends with him yelling at himself in the mirror in an anti-New York rant that turns into an aria of enraged self-hatred. (Its like the montage of invectives from ""Do the Right Thing"" recapitulated by Eminem and Tom Wolfe.) Later Jakob and Frank engage in a petty argument in front of Franks living room window which overlooks Ground Zero. Its a ""hill of beans"" moment one that recalls Bogarts line in ""Casablanca"" and reminds viewers of the disproportionate scale of Montys suffering. In his now-signature style which combines realism with bold Brechtian breaks with the linear narrative Lee continually punctuates the action onscreen with surreal shots of people moving dreamily through space or as with the films penultimate sequence highly pitched representations of Montys inner life. Soaked with the mournful gravitas of last looks and long goodbyes ""25th Hour"" never tips its hand as to where exactly its going; Lee works up an almost excruciating sense of tension and foreboding as Monty approaches dawn. Benioffs script is suitably subtle and allusive its digressions artfully drawing the audience further down its mysterious path. Lees congenital literalism -- in the past often expressed in a tendency to be too on-the-nose too polemical -- here serves him well as he penetrates ever more deeply into the music and meaning of every scene. He has elicited consistently extraordinary performances Norton takes hold of his character with the intelligence and focus we now expect from this gifted actor but dont overlook Hoffman (in whose hands a simple sigh becomes an exhalation of deep anguish) or Dawson and Pepper who keep their characters motivations always a little bit unclear. Working with cinematographer Rodrigo Pietro Lee uses his characteristic palette of varying film stocks to create a movie whose very surface is alive with grain and texture; his longtime composer Terence Blanchard has composed a magnificent score that achieves the intimacy of Leonard Bernsteins music for ""On the Waterfront"" (listen to the piano that accompanies the early scenes with Monty and Naturelle) and the exalted emotion of Aaron Copland whose music accompanied the moving opening sequence of Lees ""He Got Game."" Reaching back to such mentors as Martin Scorsese -- whose ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Last Temptation of Christ"" are paid homage here -- Lee has nonetheless created a movie very much his own one that aches with the pain of his times and pulses with the rhythms of his city. But with ""25th Hour"" Lee is not content to create merely a New York portrait although surely from this quintessential New York filmmaker that would be welcome enough. In the startling unforgettable masterstroke that concludes the movie Lee starts out by paying homage to one mans home town but he slowly turns that gesture into a hymn to America in all its restless energy and outlaw spirit its love of reinvention and its seductive elusive dreams. With the small story of a relatively seedy character Lee has created that rarity in filmmaking a movie we need right now. 25th Hour (134 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong language and some violence.

Starring Edward Norton Rosario Dawson and Brian Cox. Directed by Spike Lee. (VHS and DVD. R. 134 minutes.) In ""25th Hour"" Spike Lee takes the story of a convicted drug dealers last day of freedom and expands it into a meditation on New York and America in the aftermath of Sept. 11 2001. From the opening credits sequence showing two beams of blue light where the World Trade Center once stood to the closing moments which evoke the dream of the wide-open road Lee takes the spiritual moment and crystallizes it into art. The result is a film of sadness and power the first great 21st century movie about a 21st century subject. The key to fully appreciating ""25th Hour"" is in not dwelling long on the analogy between New York and the movies protagonist Monty (Edward Norton) a young man whos about to go up the river for seven years on a drug charge. The parallels are there but they only go so far Montys past was full of money and the delusion of omnipotence and his future is a question mark. In one scene Montys two best friends discuss his prospects sitting by a window overlooking ground zero. To contemplate Montys future is to look into an abyss. But metaphors are easy. Lees real achievement is in getting that post-Sept. 11 feeling into his movies structure. Watch ""25th Hour"" and its as if everyone in the film has been hit in the head and is just coming to. The pace of scenes is measured and the characters (not the actors) seem not only uncertain but also in reaction against their uncertainty. Montys reaction is anger. The reaction of his schoolteacher friend Jake (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a misguided fixation on a vivacious underage student (Anna Paquin). And his stockbroker pal Frank (Barry Pepper) reacts with a denial so profound that he even trusts the Environmental Protection Agency when it says the air is safe in his Manhattan neighborhood. His denial has an aggressiveness that threatens to trample everything gentle in his nature. ""25th Hour"" takes place over the course of 24 hours with time out for flashbacks but for a single exception -- the very first scene. Taking place at an indeterminate time in the recent past the scene is there for no apparent reason Monty rescues an abused dog and thats about all. Yet the scene serves a function to show an earlier mood a last gasp of optimism and decisiveness thats nothing like anything or anyone in the rest of the film. Pre-bust and pre-Sept. 11 Monty was living in a kind of happy innocence and didnt know it. Months later walking his dog along the harbor on his last day of freedom hes a different man. His walk is still straight but its the walk of someone who knows that all he has left is the dignity of his bearing a king going to the scaffold. He cant even trust his girlfriend (Rosario Dawson) whom he suspects may have given him up to the cops to save herself. Like all Lees best movies ""25th Hour"" is both interesting and ungainly -- Lee has so much he wants to say that he needs to break the mold and he does so in a magnificent set piece early in the movie. Monty goes into a mens room and his reflection in the mirror launches into a tirade against all the various peoples of New York the blacks the Bensonhurst Italians the Park Avenue rich Korean grocers cabdrivers from India and Yankees fans from the boroughs. Samuel Johnson once said that when a man is tired of London hes tired of life. Lee is showing that when a man is sick of New York hes sick of the world and everything in it. This is a love poem. This is Spike Lees ""Rhapsody in Blue"" and its a thing of beauty. With a slice-of-life film such as ""25th Hour"" theres always the challenge of how to end it. Lee and screenwriter David Benioff bring the film to a place of poetry with a fantasy of America and open spaces thats slightly funny and mostly stirring and still very much about New York. . This film contains sexual situations violence and harsh language.

"CNN.com - Review A thoughtful timely 25th Hour - Jan. 11 2003 CNN Europe CNN Asia Languages --------- Spanish Portuguese German Italian Korean Arabic Japanese On CNN TV Transcripts Headline News CNN International About CNN.com Preferences Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Review A thoughtful timely 25th Hour Great performances fill new Spike Lee film By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Edward Norton plays a drug dealer about to go to jail in ""25th Hour"" directed by Spike Lee. Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive  EW.com Movie reviews (CNN) -- Spike Lees new film ""25th Hour"" may be most notable for being the first major film to deal with New York City post-September 11. The plot has nothing to do with the terrorist attack or its aftermath but the film matter-of-factly incorporates this hideous event into the citys historical fabric. One scene is actually set in an apartment overlooking Ground Zero. Since the movies theme is about a mans life being blasted away the metaphor is obvious. As he did in ""Do the Right Thing"" (1989) -- a film nominated for two Oscars -- Lee is once again tackling a story that takes place in one 24-hour period with ""25th Hour."" Based on a book by David Benioff the movie stars Edward Norton as Monty Brogan a Manhattan drug dealer who has just run out of luck. Hes been busted and is on his way to spending seven long years in prison. On his last day of freedom hes desperate to clean up and shore up some relationships from his past -- and present. His life in the fast lane has left some personal casualities in its wake including his father his two closest friends and the woman he thinks hes in love with. The result is a powerful -- if flawed -- story about redemption hope and forgiveness that is perfectly underscored by the exquisite music provided by Terence Blanchard. Mixed feelings Norton and Lee make a great team. Both men are excellent storytellers and both share an emotional honesty that shines through on screen. In their hands what could have been just another run-of-the-mill unsavory convicted drug dealer is turned into a sympathetic antihero. He may be getting exactly what he deserves but nevertheless we root for his redemption until the closing credits. Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Jacob a private-school teacher and a longtime friend of Nortons character. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Barry Pepper play Brogans childhood buddies Jacob a shy private-school teacher and Slaughtery a loudmouthed Wall Street hustler respectively. Both Jacob and Slaughtery have mixed complex feelings regarding their old friend. Theyve both stood aside and watched his descent into a life of crime but theyve also both benefited from the first-class treatment at restaurants and clubs that Brogans shady but profitable career has provided. Now with his life in ashes theyre not sure how to treat him or how to handle his last day of freedom. Rosario Dawson plays Naturelle Rivera a young woman who has had a long and complex relationship with Brogan -- and who may or may not have turned him into the police leading to his arrest and prison term. With previous roles in such duds as ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash"" and ""Men In Black II"" Dawson is in need of a break and gets it with this excellent part. Her faithfulness -- or lack of it -- is a major plot point and her character must keep Brogan and the audience guessing. Brian Cox gives a multilayered performance as Brogans father James. Hes a retired fireman who now owns a pub which his sons ill-gotten money has helped to finance. Hes torn by guilt over the fact that rather than keeping his son away from crime hes actually encouraged the illegal activity by taking money from him. Their relationship is the most complex of the bunch and their scenes together are heartwrenching. Academy Award-winning actress Anna Paquin plays a small role as a student who becomes entangled in the groups dynamic. Sides of New York Many of Lees trademarks are front and center. As with Martin Scorsese New York City is Lees location of choice and what kind of Spike Lee movie would it be without some sort of speech on race? In the case of ""25th Hour"" the speech is a tirade delivered by Brogan in a nightclub bathroom screaming ethnic obscenities into a mirror. The shocking scenes payoff occurs later in the film as part of Brogans journey towards redemption. The performances by Norton Hoffman and Pepper are all excellent and Cox (in only two major scenes) is the heart and soul of the film. Basically ""25th Hour"" is a new spin on the old question What would you do if you only had 24 hours left to live? Brogans choices and his friends and familys reactions to them make a compelling and thoughtful film. ""25th Hour"" opened in selected markets December 19 and goes into wide release Friday. It is rated R.

"What Spike Lees 25th Hour is really about. Slate Sign In Sign Up What Spike Lees 25th Hour is really about. What Spike Lees 25th Hour is really about. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 19 2002 545 PM Back Door Blues What Spike Lees 25th Hour is really about. By David Edelstein Norton contemplating anal rape Spike Lees entrancing 25th Hour (Touchstone) revolves around Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) a convicted New York drug dealer with only one day left before he heads upstate to prison for seven years. Monty passes the hours by thinking back over his life as the son of alcoholic firefighter turned bar owner (Brian Cox) the courier of a Russian mobster and the boyfriend of a hotcha Puerto Rican girl (Rosario Dawson) who might have tipped off agents to his stash. He also reaches out to his childhood pals the timid prep-school English teacher Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and the ruthless Wall Street hotshot Slaughtery (Barry Pepper). Although the novel and the screenplay (both by David Benioff) were written before 9/11 Lee injects New Yorks tragedy into the mix. He opens with a shot of two beams of light where the twin towers once stood. And as Monty and a dog he has picked up wander the city--perhaps for the last time--we see a steady stream of American flags and memorials even Ground Zero itself. Advertisement At its best 25th Hour is a melancholy tone poem deeply affecting in its mute apprehension of loss with a lush imposing orchestral score by Terence Blanchard that could be titled ""Elegy for 9/11"" along with Bruce Springsteens ""The Fuse"" (with a Blanchard string arrangement) over the closing credits. But the movie is also muddled by its own ambitions. There is simply no connection between the themes of Benioffs screenplay and 9/11 and every time Lee over-inflates the story he loses its real pulse. In one sequence Jacob and Slaughtery stand before a large picture window with a prime view of Ground Zero. Theyre talking about their friends coming maximum-security imprisonment Jacob has a naive faith that Monty will emerge intact in seven years; Slaughtery doesnt think that a slender cutie like him will survive among all those muscular horny sociopaths for very long. But all that registers for the audience is the pit; and Lee ends the scene with a long mournful shot of bulldozers clearing away what once was the World Trade Center. Barring the unlikely idea that the bulldozers symbolize said muscular sociopaths something central hasnt been fully dramatized. Not to put too fine a point on it the story of 25th Hour is fueled by the threat of anal rape Its what preoccupies Monty and its the heart of the sexual-panic motif that runs (subtly mischievously) through the screenplay (in different directorial hands the film could been a queasy comedy). Monty urges his girlfriend to put on a short clingy cleavage-baring white dress for his last night at a mob-owned nightclub with the boys; Jacob struggles with his lust for his flirty poetry student (Anna Paquin) who shows up high on Ecstasy and pulls him into a druggy slow-motion pas de deux thats one of the movies high spots; and Slaughtery spends his spare time numerically quantifying his and his buddies desirability to women. Sexual panic fuels the wrenching climax too in which Monty prevails upon Slaughtery to save him from those muscular convicts by doing something that no pal should ever have to do--but that many pals might want to do. To make any sense 25th Hour needed the kind of displaced homoerotic vibe that David Fincher brought to Fight Club (1999). But Lee is not--how can I put this tactfully?--a director who seems comfortable tackling homoeroticism even for a second even obliquely. And besides he has monuments to 9/11 to erect. After a spate of dull and/or gimmicky performances Norton is once again in his peculiar element His voice and countenance are angry but his body has a plaintive poetic curl. His reediness is a nice foil for the big doleful Hoffman who here sounds uncannily like Al Franken (with a bit of Dustin Hoffman nasality). The only jarring note in Nortons characterization is a scene in the spirit of Do the Right Thing (1989) in which Monty stares into the mirror and delivers a syncopated harangue against the citys sundry ethnic groups. Its not clear what any of these tribes have to do with Montys predicament--hes an educated Irish white boy who works for Russians. But it does set up Lees (and Blanchards) lyrical leave-taking of the city when all the groups that fueled Montys rage are now seen bidding him a tender adieu. This is love supreme in a Spike Lee joint a place where you hate everyone and everyone hates you but parting is such sweet sorrow. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Often the stuffing is terrifically tasty (Jungle Fever). Other times as in He Got Game its still far preferable to the ingredients in some other directors more in-control movie. But here as in 1999s Summer of Sam prepare for indigestion. Movie review 25th Hour ( out of four) Rating R for strong language and some violence. Opens Thursday in New York and Los Angeles. Hours primary focus -- though at times its tough to tell -- is on a drug dealer (Edward Norton) and his final day in New York before beginning a prison term. Even here the movie is shaky and sometimes not even very fresh. When a frustrated Norton stands in front of a mirror and uncharacteristically rants against every ethnic interest group he regards as a guiltier party against society our minds go back to the actors Oscar-nominated performance in American History X as a hate merchant. Weve seen this before. What we havent seen is a soused Anna Paquin as a high schooler straddling an equally drunk English teacher (Philip Seymour Hoffman) whos trying to repress his long-held secret yen. This takes place during Nortons final bash at a trendy nightspot and the morally upright Hoffman isnt so hammered that hes not also mortified. Now this is interesting as Paquin gets further from her Oscar-winning role in The Piano and soaring with those geese in Fly Away Home. But it seems extraneous as does an undeveloped subplot about another lifelong Norton pal (Barry Pepper) and his work as a bond trader. Peppers big office scene is right out of Oliver Stones Wall Street though writer David Benioff (adapting his own novel) doesnt show much of Stones snap or devilishness in a 2amp;frac_one_quarter;-hour movie that always rambles. Its intended key intrigue is whether Nortons loving but flashy apartment mate (Rosario Dawson) set him up with the feds but it tends to get lost. Lee obviously put a lot of work into the elaborate visuals of Nortons mirror diatribe and in a climactic dream sequence that recalls Nicolas Cages at the end of Raising Arizona. Lee will never make a film thats simply routine and never has. But December is the years most Darwinian movie month -- not the ideal time for a film this flawed to get a limited year-end opening in hopes of awards. The filmmakers had better be prepared to wait considerably more than 25 hours for this to happen. Like eternity.

A young dark-skinned black boy stands in a sprawling green field dressed in a dark suit staring solemnly ahead at a massive barn. His hand is taken by a smiling adult who leads him through the field and into the barn where a great many black folk are waiting dressed in clothing that ranges from plantation chic to contemporary casual. Mountains of soul food are piled atop a long wooden table. This is where I thought ""Oh shit. Ive been sucked into some Steven Spielberg/Maya Angelou/Oprah Winfrey miasma of hallowed Negro ancestors artery-clogging food and fetishized fellowship."" But then a gun fired blood sprayed across a wall and the movie really began. The bucolic scene turns out to be a dream of longing for Antwone Fisher (Derek Luke) a U.S. Navy sailor with a hair-trigger temper and emotional wounds that bleed messily into his everyday life. More important following that crack of gunfire the film offers an impressive melding of quietly radical images and ideas with yes an old-fashioned crowd-pleasing holiday tearjerker. Its also a deeply assured directing debut from actor Denzel Washington. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Sullen aloof and quick to throw punches Fisher -- after one too many on-duty brawls -- is forced to undergo psychiatric evaluation with Dr. Davenport (Washington) a midcareer military man whose own home life is tumultuous beneath the strained civility of his relationship with his wife Berta (Salli Richardson). The unfolding of this patient-doctor relationship follows a familiar course Resentment and stony silence from the patient slowly thaws into a life-altering relationship with the wry patient doctor as the two forge a bond beyond blood. As the long-repressed pain and vulnerability beneath Fishers anger slowly come to the surface flashbacks flesh out his childhood of emotional physical and sexual abuse. It almost goes without saying that the physician sparked by the example of his patient heals himself. What makes Antwone Fisher so much more than its conventional blueprint would suggest is Washingtons fidelity to the details within the outline which is based on a true story. The real-life Fisher now a screenwriter and novelist wrote the script and theres no sugarcoating or flinching as author and director examine the Angry Negro at the films center struggling to decipher the hows and whys of his life. Religious hypocrisy soul-debilitating abuse at the hands of female caretakers and the staggering indifference of an overburdened foster-care program all had a strong hand in shaping Fisher. Indeed what gives the leisurely paced film its bite is its detailed indictment of the subtler domestic forms of black-on-black crime. The God-fearing foster mother who takes in Fisher and two other boys pits the fair-skinned boy with ""good hair"" against his nappy-headed darker foster siblings. (And credit first-time director Washington for being among the few to employ a cinematographer Philippe Rousselot who actually knows how to light dark skin.) She never calls the boys by their names instead varying vocal inflections when she calls ""Nigger"" in order to differentiate among the three. And in one of the films sharpest insights (delivered in what is unfortunately one of Antwone Fishers clunkier bits of dialogue) Dr. Davenport identifies the violent beatings the boys frequently endured as a legacy of slavery that black folk have incorporated as a cultural norm. But the film is far from being a joyless recitation of cause and effect; its unapologetically life-affirming determinedly uplifting. In Fishers fledgling romance with a female sailor there is both levity and tenderness. Exchanges between the doctor and his patient are spiked with dry humor as their relationship evolves. And a Thanksgiving dinner scene is all but stolen by the criminally underrated actress/comedian Jenifer Lewis who manages to wring laughter out of the throwaway line ""How you doin?"" Even some of the harshness of Fishers childhood is played for bitter laughs countering the films occasional drift into sentimentality. Antwone Fisher is hardwired into its title characters emotional life and the viewer rides through his disappointments and heartache as well as his triumphs.

Aug. 15 705pm Premium Seating Los Angeles Angels v SEATTLE MARINERS Tickets Mon. Aug. 15 705pm Its a journey handled with exceptional skill by newcomer Luke who had only a handful of television appearances under his belt before landing this star-making role. Even in expressing his characters volatility the actor never drifts into caricature and Fishers slow transformation into an emotionally stable adult reads absolutely true. Washingtons performance is as weve come to expect flawless while Salli Richardson in what is more a concept than a character graces Berta with an affecting woundedness. But the most thrilling performance in the film belongs to Viola Davis so good in the recent releases Solaris and Far From Heaven. As a woman who reels when presented with the consequences and unexpected bounty of a lifetime of bad choices her face goes absolutely still then fans a wide breadth of emotion as she sits in heartbreaking silence. Its only a few minutes of screen time but its one of the best performances of the year. JUST ABOUT THE ONLY GOOD THING YOU CAN say about Spike Lees pointless didactic The 25th Hour is that its filled with strong performances albeit of stock characters. Theres Barry Pepper as the droll renegade Wall Street hustler who gets most of the films good lines (""You know what a man should never ask in a Victorias Secret shop? Does this come in childrens sizes?""). Philip Seymour Hoffman in a part he could pull off in his sleep portrays a schlubby high school literature teacher trying to force himself to recoil from his lust for a female student (a snottily precocious Anna Paquin in the films one truly awful performance) while the physically stunning Rosario Dawson handles her gig as ""the girlfriend"" by doing exactly what shes asked to which is to look unbelievably fuckable in every frame. Theyre all characters weve seen before and though well acted they have nothing new to say as they rotate around Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) who has 24 hours before he has to turn himself in to the authorities to serve a seven-year sentence for dealing drugs. The movie follows him as he fills those hours the hook being that he has one last lamebrained idea to save himself from the horrors of prison. (The movie in the end is about nothing more than fear of sodomy. Pun intended.) Norton who in the past has been able to swell himself up into the outlines of a muscle-bound neo-Nazi or shrink himself to the dimensions of a self-help junkie is utterly defeated here by a character with no character. The movie is told largely in flashback (how Monty got his dog how he met his girlfriend how he met his downfall) but we never really get inside Montys head and were never given a reason to want to. Theres no compelling story here as the movie listlessly flits from one loosely connected set piece to another; instead Lee and screenwriter David Benioff who adapted the script from his novel fill the movie with a lot of gallingly ham-fisted tributes to 9/11. In one scene two characters talk endlessly in front of a window overlooking the excavation of the World Trade Centers twin towers. At the end of this interminable back and forth the camera zooms ominously into the wound as Terence Blanchards score becomes more and more histrionic. The horror you feel is not the one Lee intends; the artless and off-putting moment provides a perfect example of why creative folk should put time between a life-shattering event and commenting on it. Spewing ones guts may be cathartic but its not automatically art. Elsewhere the director shamelessly rips himself off having Monty go off on a rant (""Fuck the Korean merchants fuck the Russian mobsters fuck the Dominicans who make the Puerto Ricans look good . . ."") that is a weak paraphrasing of a similar bit from Do the Right Thing. Director of photography Rodrigo Prieto (Amores Perros) gives the film a grittily poetic look that flatters both quiet brownstone-lined neighborhoods and blue-tinged hip-hop-scored nightclubs. But Prietos visual flair cant mask the tedium of sitting through the film or the fact that in making The 25th Hour Spike Lee brought all his trademark hard sell but none of his passion or purpose.

Ubiquitous novelist-screenwriter David Benioff gets his first screen credit with an ambitious adaptation for director Spike Lee of his debut novel ""25th Hour"" about a convicted drug dealer coming to terms with his life and choices during his last 24 hours of freedom. Attempting to transform superior pulp into something thematically richer the writer and director heighten the role of the storys setting to create a post-9/11 symphony on the strength resilience and hope of New York City thats sure to draw considerable attention. Some lapses into melodramatic self-importance and gratuitous stylistic flourishes that take the audience out of the action will rankle many critics but these concerns are outweighed by the steadily amplified emotional power of this ultimately moving drama. However the introspective odyssey appears unlikely to cross beyond Lees standard commercial threshold. Touchstone deserves credit for backing such unconventional material. Character-driven pic provides strong opportunities for a fine ensemble of actors and for Lee maintaining his signature style to depart from his regular ethnic territory working for the first time with a drama built predominantly around white characters and to deliver one of his more interesting recent films. Drama marks an intelligent textured screenwriting debut for NYC native Benioff attached to a slew of high-profile studio projects adapting everything from Hemingway to Homer and penning scripts for directors such as Wolfgang Petersen David Fincher Kimberly Peirce Curtis Hanson and Marc Forster. Benioff sticks close to the structure and much of the razor-sharp dialogue of the already highly cinematic 2001 novel resulting in a multicharacter narrative that continually shifts from the central figure to take in the lives of the people around him. While disrupting some of the films focus this adds an engaging novelistic tableau. Taking place over a volatile 24-hour period in much the same way as Lees ""Do the Right Thing"" story picks up on savvy educated Brooklynite Monty Brogan (Edward Norton) with one day to go before checking in to prison for seven years on a drug conviction. Monty tries to account for the direction his life has taken while saying his goodbyes to family friends his drug associates and Naturelle (Rosario Dawson) the girlfriend who may or may not have sold him out to the DEA. The day and night serve also as a farewell to the city he knows from a position of privilege and power. The film focuses as much on Montys friends examining the way personal history outweighs any present connection for the three central characters who went through school together. Trios other two members are hotshot Wall Street bond trader Frank (Barry Pepper) who grew up with Monty in an Irish neighborhood and Jacob (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a poorly paid teacher described by Frank as a ""whining malcontent"" whose sorry existence is an apology for his rich Jewish upbringing. Both men are down on themselves for allowing Monty to become enmeshed in the drug business. Jacobs self-loathing gets additional fuel from his attraction to underage lit student Mary (Anna Paquin) who manipulates him with her sexuality but is shocked when he responds. Prior to a private party in a club run by Russian mobster Uncle Nikolai (Levani) Monty has dinner with his widowed father (Brian Cox). Still grieving his wife after many years and now readying to grieve in a different way for his son the man is full of self-reproach for having accepted Montys dirty money to pull the bar he owns out of debt. Screenplay meanders a bit over various encounters and flashbacks such as Montys drug bust and his first meeting with Naturelle but builds confidently toward a brutal climax which underlines the complexity of the flawed but binding relationships. The narrative is punctuated by some bold set pieces some better than others. As Monty stares into a restroom mirror he launches into a long ""fuck-you"" to every part of New York and every faction of its citizenry. Vastly elaborated from the book this angry ode-cum-homage feels wedged in and ostentatious. Likewise is a scene in Franks downtown apartment overlooking construction work at Ground Zero which Lee lingers on far too long bludgeoning the audience with righteous indignation. The tendency for over-extended scenes is a constant but the most impressive stylistic detour is a long flash-forward superbly delivered in a monologue by Cox imagining an alternative future for Monty. The novel repeatedly dwells upon Montys head-turning physical beauty; his pretty-boy face is considered a sure ticket to bitch-boy status on the cell-block -- a major fear factor for him. While Norton is a less obvious choice for the role than say Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp he convinces with effortless charisma and intelligence. Norton penetrates the mindset of a guy with an expiration date on his freedom creating a character that has existed comfortably on dubious moral ground but is neither a bad person nor entirely unsympathetic. Hoffman plays a conflicted man whos chronically miserable yet idealistic and not without hope while Pepper contributes perhaps his best screen work to date juggling love and resentment for Monty quietly burning for his girlfriend and simmering with judgmental anger. Paquin is sassy and outwardly hard-edged while Dawsons lovely performance balances the uneasiness that suspicion has introduced into the relationship with tenderness and her determination to stay close to Monty through a tough time. Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (""Amores perros"" ""8 Mile"") brings a gritty look to the widescreen visuals orchestrating beautiful fluid tracking shots and often playing with color saturation and film stock to create grainy textures. As always in Lees collaborations with composer Terence Blanchard music is used under almost every scene sometimes to rather bombastic effect. Laced with haunting Tamil vocals by British-based Sri Lankan musician Manickam Yogeswaran the full-bodied brooding score contributes to an at times overly portentous operatic feel but is key to establishing and sustaining the dramas uneasy troubling mood and shaping its emotional crescendo. 25th HourProductionA Buena Vista release of a Touchstone Pictures presentation of a 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks Industry Entertainment Gamut Films production.
