Summit Entertainment By Joe Morgenstern Updated July 9 2010 1201 a.m. ET Youd never guess what the best part of ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" proves to be. It isnt blood-sucking monsters doing their thing though theres some of that to feed the franchise and its definitely not vampires and werewolves having at each other in a cosmic showdown. No this not-bad tale comes to its fullest flower one night during a wintry storm inside a tent when a shivering Bella is attended by her two newly solicitous and darned near all-American beaux. Edward who plays for the vampire team isnt the right one to raise her body temperature so he defers to Jacob who plays for the werewolves and then the two suitors have a civilized discussion about whos really right for her. I cant pretend that the third episode instilled a fever in my blood but it didnt leave me cold. For the first time in the series I felt Id seen a real movie. Watch a scene from The Twilight Saga Eclipse starring Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. Video courtesy of Summit Entertainment. The cast and main characters remain the same Kristen Stewart as the endlessly conflicted Bella; Robert Pattinson as earnest Edward who like the film as a whole takes himself less seriously this time around (""If we werent natural enemies and you werent trying to steal the reason for my existence"" he tells his rival with something resembling a grin ""I might actually like you""); and Taylor Lautners ever-buff Jacob who does own shirts but wears them as seldom as possible. The performances havent changed much either. Ms. Stewart still has trouble conveying feelings and speaking clearly--maybe that reflects Bellas problems with thinking clearly--even when she makes such straightforward statements as ""Gosh its so pretty here."" Read More Eclipse Breaks Record for Wednesday Opening Not that the tweenage fans of these movies need to see Bella as a poster girl for elocution. They see her as they see themselves frightened of romance and yearning for it in equal measure. (To make matters more fearful as well as exciting Bellas high school graduation is at hand.) And theyll be gratified this time to find her the recipient of doubly loving attention since what has changed significantly is the regional dynamic. A gang of young out-of-control vampires has been terrorizing Seattle and having passed around the heroines scent is headed for bucolic Forks. Before they arrive Edwards family and Jacobs lupine tribe strike up a temporary alliance to keep Bella safe. ENLARGE Left also in Eclipse Xavier Samuel in front as the villainous Riley. Summit Entertainment If some of this makes ""Eclipse"" sound talkier than it is (i.e. quite talky and sometimes pleasantly so) the production under David Slades workmanlike direction takes several time-outs--or time-ins depending on your bloodlust level--for bluntly efficient if familiar battles. (In that department only the wolves have been changed; they seem to have more personality than before.) Bellas police-chief father Charlie (Billy Burke) gets sympathetic laughs when he tries to protect his daughter by grounding her. How little he knows like so many fathers of adventurous girls about how much the ground is shifting beneath her. Watch a scene from The Last Airbender a film directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. The Last Airbender Never mind that the little kid flapping his arms to whip up the waves in ""The Last Airbender"" suggests a pouty-faced version of Mickey Mouse as the Sorcerers Apprentice. Or that the movie looks no worse if you take off your 3-D glasses. (It looks better only if you close your eyes.) Or that the default color is murky purple just as the default mood is morose. Or that M. Night Shyamalans big-screen live-action version of the popular Nickelodeon animated TV series constitutes a form of Chinese water torture in which tin-ear line-readings take the place of drips. Theres a serious mystery here and it extends to the highest levels of Hollywoods decision-makers. Why did any studio executives think the results might be better? The filmmaker has delivered yet another iteration of what has become a classic M. Night Shyamalan film only much bigger than before and as a consequence mind-bendingly turgid. Before exploring that mystery let me try to convey a bit more of ""Airbenders"" awfulness. The young hero of the title a long-lost and long-awaited avatar named Aang is played by a 12-year-old newcomer named Noah Ringer. According to Mr. Ringers understandably slim curriculum vitae he holds a first-degree black belt in taekwondo. To judge from an informal interview posted on YouTube he is extremely personable lively and humorous when hes off screen. On screen alas he is none of those things thanks to the reverse wizardry of his director. (No one else can be blamed when an actor has had no professional experience.) Its painful to watch him struggling with his banal lines or doing nutty dances to augment the water-bending effect of all those arm flaps. ENLARGE Noah Ringer inThe Last Airbender. Industrial Light amp; Magic His lines are no more banal than those of the bad guys chasing him; they are portrayed in descending order of badness by Aasif Mandvi Cliff Curtis and Dev Patel. All three play their characters as steady-state scowlers so their scenes keep yielding little howlers. (Though Im not so sure about Mr. Mandvi a regular on ""The Daily Show With Jon Stewart""; his scowls and growls seem like variants of winks and nods.) The producers have been widely criticized for failing to cast the Asian characters of the original with Asian actors and the criticism is valid notwithstanding the presence of Asians in minor roles. Like the hero Aang the lead characters of the brave sister and brother Katara and Sokka are played by young and conspicuously Caucasian American actors--Nicola Peltz and Jackson Rathbone (who also plays the ""Twilight"" vampire Jasper Hale). But where does criticism end when a production is botched from start to finish? All of which brings us back to the question of expectations and how Mr. Shyamalan keeps getting work. Eleven years ago he electrified the movie world with the emotional power and dramatic surprise of ""The Sixth Sense."" He followed up with two flawed but intriguing features ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs."" In the past eight years though his oeuvre has gone from bad (""The Village"") to worse (""Lady in the Water"") to worst (""The Happening."") Purists might argue that his last film was less dreadful than his penultimate one but the hallmarks were the same stilted language robotized acting glacial pace ponderous style dramatic ineptitude and negligible energy. I never meant to make this review an exercise in career assassination but I cant help thinking of all the lavishly talented filmmakers who have earned and never gotten a shot at big-budget success. Whats the secret of this guys failure? DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Irma Vep (1996) The matchless Maggie Cheung plays a version of herself--a Hong Kong martial-arts star who speaks no French--in Olivier Assayass marvelous French-language film about the perils of filmmaking and not incidentally vampires. Jean-Pierre Leaud (the star of so many classic New Wave films by Messrs. Truffaut and Godard) is Rene Vidal a New Wave director who wants to keep from being completely washed up by remaking the silent serial ""Les Vampires"" with Ms. Cheung as his leading lady. The film already available through Netflix on DVD went online yesterday as a Netflix streaming download. ENLARGE Wolfen (1981) The attraction here is the great English actor Albert Finney as Dewey Wilson an alcoholic police captain on the trail of a pack of superwolves terrorizing New York City. (No they dont deal in derivatives by day.) Two other werewolf movies came out the same year ""The Howling"" and ""An American Werewolf In London"" but this is the one with smarts and a strong bite. Gerry Fisher was the cinematographer. The cast includes Gregory Hines Diane Venora Edward James Olmos and Tom Noonan. Its the only fiction film directed by Michael Wadleigh who did the 1970 documentary ""Woodstock."" ENLARGE Slumdog Millionaire (2008) Part of the fun of picking these DVD picks is finding worthwhile films that have been forgotten or are edging toward obscurity. Thats hardly the case with Danny Boyles recent Oscar-winning romantic fable set in contemporary Mumbai the former Bombay. But its instructive to see what the same actor Dev Patel was able to do for the endlessly exuberant Mr. Boyle and what he was induced or very possibly doomed to do in ""The Last Airbender"" for M. Night Shyamalan who was born in India but brought up in suburban Philadelphia. Its the difference between radiant day and gloomy Night. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A girl a vampire and a werewolf continue their supernatural love triangle. BOTTOM LINE Accidental hilarity at least livened up the last two ""Twilight"" movies. This time no such luck. CAST Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Taylor Lautner LENGTH 201 In a rare moment of insight the teenage but immortal vampires in ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" complain about being ""frozen"" in their lives unable to ""move forward."" So is everyone involved in this deathtrap of a franchise. With each new installment (were on No. 3) another director sells his or her creative soul and swears to obey the ""Twilight"" covenant. The make-out scenes shall be plentiful though obviously sapped of suspense given the series finger-wagging attitude toward premarital sex. Melissa Rosenbergs dialogue shall remain at teen-soap level. (""Were done here."" ""No youre done here"") Even the lighting which soaks every face in a stock shade of moody blue shall not change. advertisement | advertise on newsday Catherine Hardwicke (""Thirteen"") and Chris Weitz (""About a Boy"") already went down; theyre followed by David Slade (""Hard Candy""). He ratchets up the violence to new levels - heads are not only smashed but severed - but theres no pushing that PG-13 rating. And so the vampires tend to shatter not bleed. The story based on Stephenie Meyers novels plods on Mortal high schooler Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is still torn between well-fanged Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and beefy werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner once again the most natural actor in this stilted pack). When the bloodthirsty Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes calling Edward and Jacob begin fighting over rescue-rights to Bella. And like many a bodice-clutching heroine before her Bella can barely hide her delight. The series is beginning to feel as airless as a coffin but director Bill Condon (""Dreamgirls"") has reportedly signed on for the next two films. ""Twilight"" has already claimed its next victim.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 30 2010 Save for later Saved Kristen Stewart left and Robert Pattinson are shown in a scene from the new movie The Twilight Saga Eclipse. Kimberley French/Summit Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of If youre not already a ""Twilight"" fanatic you probably dont need to hear about the latest installment ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" the third chapter in the hit series based on Stephenie Meyers megablockbuster bestsellers. These are the books and movies that have turned tweens and teens and even grown women into gaga hysterics. Vampires are all the rage now. ""The Vampire Diaries"" ""True Blood"" and ""The Gates"" are all on TV but ""Twilight"" directed by David Slade and written by Melissa Rosenberg is the biggie. Settling in for a screening of the new film is for its enthusiasts a kind of ritual akin to burning incense in a holy shrine. (I suppose you could say the same thing about the ""Sex and the City"" movies but let that pass.)In this latest go-round Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) finds herself torn more than ever between square-jawed pasty-faced amber-eyed hunk Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and wolfish werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). As always the biggest screams emanating from the audience come when Lautner bares his chest. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Jacob keeps trying to convince Bella who looks perpetually stricken that she loves him more than she loves Edward. His love for her he implies is an ""inter-animal thing."" (No wonder she wavers.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Edward meanwhile is attempting with his vampire cohorts to band with the werewolves against the invading Newborn Army peopled - or unpeopled - by newly turned vampires whose blood lust is at its peak.None of this it seems to a nonfanatic like me is really what the movie is all about. ""Twilight"" is essentially an adolescent female fantasia about coming to terms with ones sexuality. There Ive said it. And Im sure no one else has ever said it.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 30 2010 629 PM Teenagers in Love Twilight Eclipse is a moving bulletin from the trenches of contemporary American girlhood. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Twilight Eclipse check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. The Volturi from Twilight Eclipse With Twilight Eclipse (Summit Entertainment) the third installment of the teen-vampire film franchise based on the books by Stephenie Meyer its clear that the movie version of the series has become its own thing a multipart organism that operates independently of the matrix that generated it. Like the Harry Potter movies the Twilight films cater--some might say pander--to fans of the books. But three films in the source material has become vestigial to the viewers enjoyment--its possible to be interested in Twilight based on the movies alone. After finishing the first book in the series I wouldnt pick up another Meyer novel for anything less than a five-figure raise. But I wouldnt miss a Twilight movie. Not because the films are good exactly but because they are terrifying transfixing and yes moving bulletins from the trenches of contemporary American girlhood. Dan Kois Village Voice review of the film compares the task of the Twilight movies to ""fan service"" the manga tradition of breaking up comic-book narratives every few pages with a cheesecake drawing of a favorite character. Eclipse is certainly awash in cheesecake or beefcake or whatever the vampire and werewolf equivalents would be. (Fang-cake? Fur-cake?) Robert Pattinson as the eternally emo vampire Edward Cullen and Taylor Lautner as the eternally shirtless werewolf Jacob all but rub themselves up against the camera. But the itch this movie scratches is more complex than the enabling of sexual fantasy. The common object of Edwards and Jacobs passion Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) is indeed passive and blank a transparent proxy for the audience. This episode takes Bellas passivity to new heights with one plot contrivance requiring her to literally be carried from place to place by Jacob. But to argue that this passivity makes Bella a weak character or a bad role model for young girls is to misapprehend the function of the Twilight universe. What Twilight has to offer its fans is not the wholesome noonday sun of feminism but the sick weird moonlight of actual desire. Advertisement Far from being a powerless cipher Bella Swan now occupies a position at the center of Twilights complex cosmology. As the only human on earth whos privy to the secrets of the vampire world--thanks to her connection with Edward and the pale-faced Cullen clan--shes wanted by the Volturi a kind of vampire Inquisition headed up by Jane (a baby-voiced but commanding Dakota Fanning). Thanks to her smoldering platonic friendship with the garment-averse Jacob Bella is also the only person capable of brokering a truce in the age-old vampire/werewolf feud. And as of this installment a fresh contingent of supernatural meanies--an army of just-created vampires known as ""newborns""--is being organized by a rogue lady vampire (Bryce Dallas Howard) for the express purpose of destroying Edward and Bellas love. This high-school romance actually has the world-historical significance that the rest of us only felt like our high-school romance had. But global interspecies monster warfare is really only the backdrop to the Twilight series just as the Civil War was the backdrop to Gone With the Wind. The real action takes place in the intersubjective space between Bella and Edward or rather among the threesome of Bella Edward and Jacob. The energy generated by this perpetually irresolvable love triangle manages by some obscure law of physics to supersede the viewers goodwill toward the characters.  In other words even if you could care less who Bella chooses--if youre neither Team Edward nor Team Jacob--you may find yourself compelled and amused by the moments when their rivalry is exposed in its raw state. Nothing like kissing your boyfriend goodbye and then making him watch as you nestle against the bare chest of the wolf-boy who must for obscure reasons now carry you across an entire forest in his arms. The triangulation torture reaches its height in a scene where Bella rather than freeze to death in a tent pitched high on a mountain must snuggle all night against Jacobs extra-warm lupine bod while Edward--who as a vampire has neither body heat nor the ability to sleep--sits up all night watching them. Weve all mistreated our fair share of suitors but not even the most cavalier heartbreaker ever dreamed of getting away with this. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. ""Its not a choice between the two of you"" Bella tells Edward at a key point in the story. ""Its a choice between who I should be and who I am."" If my Twilight decoder amulet is still working that means that our heroine is torn between the warm mortal animal love she feels for Jacob and the cold eternal sexless-but-therefore-sexy sublimity of her bond with Edward. But this line of dialogue has another possible interpretation one that (like the whole series) puts the audience in Bellas place. The choice of whether to see Eclipse isnt really a question of whether the movie is good or bad. (By any objective thumbs-up or thumbs-down standard of aesthetic judgment this installment directed by David Slade is in keeping with the previous two films a competently made bit of Gothic schlock.) Its a question of whether or not the movie speaks to your secret unregulated inherently ridiculous experience of identification and desire--not who you should be but who you are. Does the warm blood of a teenager still flow beneath your icy grown-up flesh? Like  Slate  on Facebook. Follow us on  Twitter. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Ravine Chase Rosalies Advice This time its war -- or something. Whats starting to clarify things is a war with the ""newborns"" -- fresh-bitten vampires who are stronger than the usual sort apparently. But the blood sport that Twilight fans will care about is the fight for high school heroine Bella a battle waged between chilly but sparkly vampire Edward and hotblooded wolf-boy Jacob he of the washboard abs. But wait Edward ended the last movie with a proposal of marriage so everythings decided right? Mmmm not so much. As Jacob snarls during a confrontation with Edward ""She doesnt know what she wants"" Macho posturing aside that newborn vampire army is headed their way from Seattle and the werewolves and the vampires need to work together to defeat them. Mostly this involves striking poses in the woods snarling a lot and waiting ... a lot. Also much bickering between Edward and Jacob in the high school parking lot. It is during one of these bouts of male posturing that Kristen Stewarts Bella refusing to choose sides says ""Im Switzerland"" and it hits me. Id been seeing this story in terms of high school gangs -- Sharks and Jets (or wolves and bats or whatever) -- when theres a much better metaphor geopolitics. Think about it Aging European aristocracy (Edward being 109 years old and downright Byronic) meets virile all-American boy (Jacob having spent most of his 16 years in the tribes gymnasium). Pasty anemic Edward loves poetry and sitting in blossom-filled meadows. Brawny Jacob likes hikes in the woods and sitting round campfires. Sure theyll be allies when the Germans -- um the newborns -- threaten. But theyre basically from different worlds. i Dont Stand So Close To Me Romantic rivals Jacob (Taylor Lautner left) and Edward share a tense moment. Kimberley French/Summit Entertainment hide caption toggle caption Kimberley French/Summit Entertainment Dont Stand So Close To Me Romantic rivals Jacob (Taylor Lautner left) and Edward share a tense moment. Kimberley French/Summit Entertainment Even their acting styles match up Robert Pattinsons an English thespian giving Edward sad eyes and a smile that looks like indigestion. Taylor Lautners Jacob is such a chest-thumping Brando-wannabe that you half expect him to throw his head back and shout ""Bell-llaaaaaaaa"" The film around them has pretty scenery pretty people pretty wolves and pretty broad winks at the audience including a jokey male-bonding scene atop a mountain ... in a tent. Bella falls asleep between her hunky boyfriends and the two of them talk about the pain of love till the sun comes up. (All thats missing is a herd of sheep outside -- and maybe the chime of a single forlorn guitar string on the soundtrack.) Director David Slade keeps the action brisk and the time-killing attractive. There are better special effects than last time and Bella gets to be brave when it counts. All of which should be like a freshly opened vein for fans -- especially as it results in Eclipse ending up almost exactly where it started with weddings still to come. Can you wait?

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post If you are feeling a bit ""once bitten twice shy"" about seeing the third installment of Stephenie Meyers blockbuster vampire tale come to the big screen you can let that go. ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" is a finer outing than 2009s ""New Moon."" Managing to be both sulky and cheesy that second film was a sequel only fans could love. While the new ""Eclipse"" remains foremost a flick for devotees it has sturdier pleasures and takes on its emotional ambitions with renewed dedication. Themes so deliciously part of the vampire ouvre -- the anguish and longing the hunger and thirst -- are handled well by returning screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg and new director David Slade (""30 Days of Night"" and ""Hard Candy""). So are the tentative promise and burgeoning burdens of growing up and taking responsibility for ones decisions. Kristen Stewart returns as Bella the human in love with the decent vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and in deep friendship with the Native American werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). When last we left the trio a vampire high council called the Volturi demanded that the Cullens make Bella a vampire. Edward has a deep reluctance to inflict that eternal nibble on his beloved. But the bill is coming due and ""Eclipse"" takes place in the space of a month. The sequel uses the resonant deadline of Bellas high- school graduation. Will Edward deliver Bella the bite she craves? Will she as Edward requires marry him first? And what about Naomi er Jacob? Loss and revenge course through ""Eclipse."" The auburn-haired vampire Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard who is new in the role) drafts Forks native Riley (Xavier Samuel) as leader of a ravenous army of freshly bitten Newborns to battle the Cullens. Bella is her true target. The action is vigorous; the acting is not. If the leads fear being forever linked to their ""Twilight"" roles perhaps they should. Stewart and Pattinson in particular have been confined and are quickly becoming defined by the brooding glances of their characters. Those from the old school recognize the aesthetic well. And if ""Twilight"" were true to its soap-opera tradition Bella and Edward would have a theme song like Luke and Laura like Bo and Hope. Still there is great fun seeing the Cullen clan aligned in battle. And theres nothing quite so retro-Tiger-Beat as watching Jacobs Wolf Pack brethren bound out of a cabin on the Quileute reservation in their aerobicized human form shirtless to a man. Most winning are Ashley Greene and Jackson Rathbone as the young -- all right very very old -- vampire loves Alice Cullen and Jasper Hale. Theres joy and friskiness in their eternal affection that even at the end of ""Eclipse"" -- but hardly the finale of ""Twilight"" -- eludes Bella and Edward. Stay tuned.

"Twilight Eclipse | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; twilight-eclipse ) Twilight Eclipse (United States 2010) June 30 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Note An argument can be made that this review contains spoilers for Eclipse. For those who have read the book there is no spoilage. For those who have watched the trailer there is no spoilage. For those who dont fit into either of those categories the question of whether or not there is spoilage is probably irrelevant. Nevertheless you have been warned. It has taken three movies for me to realize that the Twilight series is not about vampires and werewolves at least not in the traditional sense. Lycanthropes and the undead are not inherently sexy unless one is into bestiality or necrophilia. What Stephanie Meyer accomplished with her bestselling books and what has been carried over and amplified in the movies is to give human form to those dark sexual desires that lurk in every subconscious. These movies are essentially Harlequin romances with a gothic tinge and attributing them with any motive beyond the resolution of romantic triangles and the intermingling of bodily fluids will inevitably lead to disappointment. Eclipse like its predecessors Twilight and New Moon is ""horror"" in its safest form. Much as ""rape fantasies"" rarely involve rape in all of its violence and degradation so The Twilight Saga has taken the vile spawn of darkness and evil and allowed them to sparkle in the light. These are neutered echoes of the dark terrors of old and the storyline that contains them is more sudsy than even Dark Shadows. Following in the wake of the often unintentionally comedic New Moon Eclipse is a breath of crypt air. The movie is still incredibly silly but in a more boisterous way like a comic book come to life. Its no longer just about Robert Pattinsons moodiness or Taylor Lautners pecs. This time around the angst has been amped up theres some danger and action and sex permeates every frame. Stephanie Meyer has said Eclipse is about the virtues of chastity. That may have been her intention but especially when taking this material into the visual realm any attempt to pretend this isnt all about sex is foolish. Eclipse is all about getting the juices flowing plain and simple. The primary storyline of Eclipse unfolds against the ongoing backdrop of the drawn-out love triangle involving the self-absorbed human teenager Bella (Kristen Stewart) the soulful vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the hunky werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner). Bella wants to get into Edwards pants Edward is playing hard to get and Jacob walks around half naked in a vain attempt to attract Bellas attention (when hes not in bad CGI wolf form that is). The two alpha males do a lot of preening and posturing until they have a heart-to-heart in a tent during the middle of a cold night. At that point one wonders if theyre going to opt for a threesome. The films insistence of dwelling on Bellas ""choice"" (Edward or Jacob) is a time-waster since its evident from the start whos going to be the winner; Bellas refusal to cut the loser free makes her come across as an unsympathetic tease. Which she is. Meanwhile trouble is brewing. The red-haired vampiress from the first movie Victoria (originally played by Rachelle Lefevre who is replaced here by Bryce Dallas Howard) is back with revenge on her mind. She wants to wipe out Bella and the Cullens. To that end she has assembled an army of ""newborn"" vampires headed by her dupe and new lover Riley (Xavier Samuel). The werewolves and vampires must make a truce to face off against Victorias force and keep Bella safe. As all this is transpiring the vampires ruling council the Volturi sit on the sidelines and watch their motives inscrutable and their involvement unclear. The director of Eclipse is David Slade (not to be confused with David Spade) who is making his second vampire-themed film. The first 30 Days of Nights featured a breed of more feral bloodsuckers. Here he has toned things down considerably but the Eclipse vampires are still more vicious than the ones we met in Twilight and New Moon. Theres more action in this outing than in the previous two combined and while that provides a much-needed injection of energy Slade spoils things by opting for the shaky-cam swish-pan quick cut form of action that renders things indecipherable until the battle is over. Maybe thats the only way to hide the bad special effects. At least Eclipse isnt in 3D. The actors deliver performances in line with what we have come to expect. Kristin Stewart an actress who shows amazing range and ability when not playing Bella continues to do her best imitation of a cardboard cutout here. She looks bored. Robert Pattinson whose headlining turn in Remember Me did nothing to elevate his acting credibility is still trying to perfect his James Dean impersonation. Taylor Lautner who spends about 50% of the film without a shirt (theres even a joke about it) reaffirms the impression that his future is in underwear modeling. Perhaps the strangest casting choice is Bryce Dallas Howard who was brought aboard because the producers wanted someone better known than Rachelle Lefevre to play the ""key role"" of Victoria. As it turns out the villainess has few appearances and fewer lines which makes one wonder why the swap was needed. Finally Stewarts Runaways co-star Dakota Fanning has a cameo (with screen time about equal to that of her appearance in New Moon) that is a little creepy although perhaps not for the right reasons. All the negatives that percolate to the surface while discussing Eclipse will be irrelevancies at best and nuisances at worst for the Twilight faithful who will largely be satisfied with the way Slade has adapted the third book in the four volume cycle. It builds on the mythos rather than diminishing it. It remains true to the source material varying only when necessary to make things more cinematic. The dialogue which sounds like the pseudo-philosophical drivel of a shallow mind attempting to think deep thoughts is true to Meyers wordplay. And it keeps the focus squarely on the Bella/Edward/Jacob interaction which is where the fans want it. Those who have not been infected by the Twilight virus before Eclipse are unlikely to become converts as a result of seeing this. But there is an upside for the guys dragged by their girlfriends to see this; the overflow of estrogen in the theater is likely to put more than one female in a ""receptive"" mood. See what I mean Twilight really is all about sex - both the metaphors in the PG-13 material on screen and the more X-rated stuff that may happen after.

Comments (8) The Twilight Saga Eclipse Video Rated PG-13  124 minutes  2010 The novel version of Eclipse was the strongest of the Twilight series elevated by its melodramatic vampire/human/werewolf love triangle and the geekily intricate world building of author Stephenie Meyer. Unfortunately the backstories are much less effective in this screen adaptation whose plot is encumbered by an endless series of flashbacks (all complete with the requisite portentous music). The character arc of vampire Edward from creepily controlling to generously respectful lover is so rushed that it barely registers leaving Robert Pattinson with little to do except look tense (and not particularly attractive). As werewolf Jake Taylor Lautner does his best to salvage things by showing his bare chest through almost the entire movie and the rest of the cast struggles gamely but the script sucks the life out of them. This is definitely the worst installment of the franchise to date. David Slade directed; with Anna Kendrick.

Well perhaps theyd do that no matter what but Eclipse is the least laughable installment yet in the series and director David Slade efficiently delivers the fan service that Twihards require. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In the world of shonen manga ""fan service"" refers to the full-page pictures of scantily clad heroines that are included in every comic as a sort of gift to readers. The adorable giant-eyed manga characters will be having pillow fights or arguing about schoolwork or whatever and then all of a sudden bam You turn the page and theres a shameless upskirt drawing of a giggling schoolgirl looking straight at you.These out-of-left-field moments are never strictly necessary in manga but they are expected; that is they are not required by the plot but are required by the medium. Theyre less arousing than they are silly a show of respect for the power of fandom. Fans are fans and they expect service.Twilight fans feel the same way even if the nature of the service differs. Sure they love shirtless Jacob and Eclipse doesnt stint on lovingly photographed shots of its pack of wolfhunks. But really the fan service that Twihards demand is a little more complicated.Eclipse delivers the greatest pleasure when it deals out pain to its stars. Especially Edward. Oh sweet Edward how you suffer R-Pattz cant act exactly but he can glower and tremble with the best of them and in Eclipse hes made to endure the unendurable. Having stashed his beloved Bella (Kristen Stewart) in a mountaintop tent for safekeeping as a battle rages below Edward must watch her shiver in the cold and then -- and then -- must allow shirtless smoldering Jacob to slide into her sleeping bag to warm her up. ""I am hotter than you"" Jacob smirks and Edward winces in near physical pain and the audience screams. Oh God they scream and you can hardly blame them so perfectly self-aware is the scene.Is there more to Eclipse than gorgeous suffering? Besides Bella agonizing over her admittedly stupid choice to become a vampire for love or Jacob haltingly admitting to Bella in Taylor Lautners adenoidal adolescents voice that he loves her? Sure there are other things. There are a couple of swell fights including a climactic battle between the vamps the wolves and a bunch of ""newborn"" vampires thats filmed with real flair. Theres Bryce Dallas Howard brought in as a scab to ham her way through the role of villainous Victoria (played in the past two films by Rachelle Lefevre). Theres an appearance by the cloaked Volturi led by the enjoyably malevolent Dakota Fanning. There are even jokes although admittedly they are as wan as the sunlight in the misty forests of Forks Washington.Slades directing resume seems eerily aimed toward scoring a Twilight gig - gloomy music videos the sex panic of Hard Candy the vamps of 30 Days of Night -- and he gives this third installment a smooth sheen and a languid pace that belies the ruthlessness with which it cuts a swath through the 629 pages of Stephenie Meyers novel. Slades better at action than he is at conversation but he gets around that by shooting the movies big arguments like action sequences with hand-held cameras and rapid cutting -- a sly nod to the fact that for Twilight devotees big emotional arguments are action sequences.For those who arent already devotees -- why bother? Dispensing entirely with context and exposition Eclipse identifies itself early as a fetish object. The movie is bookended by scenes of Edward and Bella making out in a meadow; its silly explanatory flashbacks are so short that no one who hasnt studied the books will make head or tail of them; it contains not one but two proposal scenes each drawn out to delicious length. The ramshackle quality that Catherine Hardwicke brought to the first movie in the series is mostly gone. Eclipse is all business. It serves the fans yes but it serves the brand even better.1 Nice tattoo.

"Eclipse movie review Too many plots make Eclipse unbelievable |       NJ.com comments Eclipse movie review Too many plots make Eclipse unbelievable Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 26 2010 at 442 AM View/Post Comments Magnolia PicturesAidan Quinn and Iben Hjejle in ""The Eclipse"" a Magnolia Pictures release.There are hauntings. And then there are the haunted. The first are those places -- abandoned houses desolate parks crumbling teardowns -- that sit in every town. The ""lonely places"" writer August Derleth called them. But the second are people -- barely living hastily breathing. And for them the past is never past. In fact its just around the corner -- waiting to reach out and grab them. ""The Eclipse"" a new film from Ireland combines both. The Eclipse (R) Magnolia (88 min.) Directed by Conor McPherson. With Ciaran Hinds Aidan Quinn Iben Hjejle. Now playing in New York. Stephen Whittys rating Two and a half stars Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and alcohol abuse. It has a haunted hero in Michael. As played by Ciaran Hinds -- the brooding actor with the Easter Island head from ""There Will Be Blood"" -- hes a widower who still cant quite get pass his loss. But it has a haunting too because Michael sees and hears things. Music where there shouldnt be. Passengers when the car should be empty. And most frighteningly his dead wife. Unfortunately just as its theme is a mix of the haunted and the haunting ""The Eclipse"" is a mix of two stories. And it shows uneasily. One is the tale of Michaels volunteering at a local literary festival and his attraction to a visiting author from London (who inconveniently already has an obsessive ex-boyfriend). The other is the story of Michaels unpredictable spookshows. Either is a possibly interesting tale but joined together here the combination seems forced and fractured. Just as we become interested in Michaels real life the ghosts come. Just as were ready for some more ghosts the authors jealous lover shows. Its a ping-pong match in which nobody wins. Ciaran Hinds -- who rarely gets the chance in the movies to play much behind a fierce inscrutable mountain of a man -- is lovely as the ghost-ridden Michael. And kudos go to Aidan Quinn too who too often plays the steady boyfriend in romances but here gets to be sharp and nasty as a writer who dislikes his readers. But unfortunately Iben Hjejle -- who plays Lena the visiting author -- isnt nearly lively enough to convince as the third point in this eventual triangle. And filmmaker McPherson -- while getting some lovely shots of the Irish seaside -- never succeeds in making Michaels literary interests or Lenas passionate interests seem quite plausible. I almost believe in ghosts sometimes. ""The Eclipse""? Not so much.

Certainly its the lightest and brightest -- everyone is still chaste but the movie is actually sexy in parts. It appears to have embraced its own sense of camp and is consistently funny in an intentional way. For the first time I found myself curious to see what comes next. But it may be that Im suffering from a self-preservation instinct a cinematic Stockholm syndrome. Eclipse marks my third trip to Forks Wash. Your first time its easy to be snotty about a place. On your second maybe you grudgingly admit that the eye candy isnt bad. But the third time your employer sends you to Forks you had better get sucked in or youll lose your mind. You have to find the joy in the endless dopey declarations of love the physical comedy in red-eyed armies of vampires fording deep Northwestern rivers and the titillation in a tent scene that plays like a parody of Brokeback Mountain yet maintains its erotic charge. (See TIMEs Summer Entertainment Preview 2010.) We first find Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and her vampire beau Edward (Robert Pattinson) embracing in a field of flowers as they are wont to do. They exchange pretty dignified kisses the kind that wont gross out any 12-year-olds. They save their tongues instead for their usual poetry. ""Marry me"" he says. ""Change me"" she demands. And so on. (See a Qamp;A with Eclipse producer Wyck Godfrey.) In the context of the worlds most vaunted human-vampire love story (unless like me you havent gotten over Buffy and Angel) ""change me"" means make me a vampire. But with socially awkward Bella the subtext is Relieve me of the human teenage condition of not fitting in. Not to mention Are you ever going to put out and change me from virgin to woman? As Bella Stewart finally seems more confident. Shes stopped fussing with her hair and she seems to relish having some humorous lines. ""Do I even want to know what that is?"" Bella asks her shape-shifting pal Jacob (Taylor Lautner) when he mentions that his wolf companions ""imprint"" on other people.(See the top 10 iconic vampires.) In a prologue a young man from Forks named Riley (Xavier Samuel) is bloodied on a Seattle dock by an unseen assailant a scene that sets up the central conflict a war between the Forks vamps and a new coven in Seattle led by red-haired Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard replacing Rachelle Lefevre). Revenge is afoot. But the real business at hand is decisionmaking. Bella has said shell stay human until after high school graduation but that day is fast approaching. The Volturi want her dead or turned. Eclipse is really about making the choice between life and death. (See portraits of the Twilight stars.) Its the bridge to the final book Breaking Dawn in which Bella is um finally fulfilled (an event so enormous it will require two box office expenditures i.e. movies). What is fascinating is how much of Eclipses language parrots the language of the never-ending abortion debate. ""I envy you. You had a choice"" Rosalie (Nikki Reed) Edwards vampire ""sister"" tells Bella. Rosalie was turned a century or so ago by a kindly vampire who found her dying in the street after a gang rape led by her fiance (now that is a vampire after-school special). ""I want you to understand all your options"" the beautiful Jacob says before presenting Bella with the first option kissing him. She could also rest her head on his warm pectoral her hand on the third can to the right in his six-pack. Doesnt that sound good? That fussy maiden Edward only lets her undo a couple of his shirt buttons. Thus the cinematic versions begin to diverge from its origin. At my preview screening when Jacob tells Bella ""Im exactly right for you Bella; it would be as easy as breathing with me"" the entire audience sighed a collective expulsion of emotion that said ""Listen to the simmering beefcake"" When her classmate Jessica (the clever Anna Kendrick) gives a graduation speech proclaiming that this is the time to make mistakes figure out who they want to be to live we all want that message to get through to stubborn Bella. But we know it wont. Anyone who was alive at the time of Breaking Dawns release knows Team Jacob is out of luck.(See Techlands top 10 worst movie characters -- including Edward Cullen.) This is not how it was supposed to go down. Edward is supposed to be the Rhett Butler figure not Jacob. You could chalk up this growing dissatisfaction with the overall narrative to a casting problem or a screenwriting issue (Lautner does get the funniest lines) except who really thinks Lautner is a more compelling presence than Pattinson? Whats happening is that the movies are demonstrating the central problem with the books becoming a vampire is a lousy choice. Mutiny may be in order. See pictures of movie costumes.

Photo Previously ""Twilight"" was my one-word rebuttal to those who claim I have the best job in the world. But the relatively streamlined ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" dispenses with much of the caramel gooeyness of the first two episodes in favor of decent action some heartfelt tender moments and even a splash of wit. This time theyre actually Twi-ing. Bella (Kristen Stewart) is still begging her vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) to ""change"" her with loves tender carotid severing. Her best buddy and local Wolfman Jacob (Taylor Lautner) asks that she choose him instead. Inviting Edwards fangs sexy as they are into her neck would leave Bella immortal frozen inside and probably soulless. PHOTOS KRISTEN STEWART PHOTOS ROBERT PATTINSON PHOTOS PATTINSON amp; STEWART Jacob counters that his heart beats and he possesses a warm body. I couldnt persuade the girls I knew in high school to take up with me on account of my being a mammal but then again maybe I should have like Jacob chosen to be shirtless at all times (even in a snowstorm). Meanwhile as the swift red-haired rival vampire Victoria (the elfin Bryce Dallas Howard) flits through the woods in nearby Seattle some freshly commissioned vampires called the Newborn Army are creating havoc in G-20-protesting style. Just bitten they remain for those first few months of vampirehood as charged-up as middle-schoolers issued with their first Super Soakers. Inching closer to Forks Wash. they promise a mighty challenge to the Cullen clan which is trying to maintain a strategic peace. The vampires truce with the werewolves is mirrored by Jacob and Edwards detente. They agree that Victorias crew is after Bellas blood -- and that neither the good vampires nor the werewolves are a match for the Newborn Army by themselves. So deploying their dream-girl chum in a school of sharks they take her into the woods in hopes of ambushing the Newborns. Bella has firmly chosen Edward but she has a couple of reasons for hanging out with Jacob too. Her father agrees to let her go on dates with Little Lord Fang-leroy if she also spends time with Dogboy plus she literally needs Jacobs wolfie body warmth on a snowy night in the woods. Her Foreigner dilemma -- whether to go with Hot Blooded or Cold As Ice sets up several of the movies fun one-liners. I laughed more during this picture than I did in Adam Sandlers ""Grown Ups."" (OK the final score was only 4 to 3 but Sandlers flick had far more cringe-inducing moments.) Jacob and Edwards Heat Miser/Cold Miser shtick smartens up the atmosphere and there is a teen poignancy to Jacobs honesty as he tells Bella he loves her and wants her to choose him -- and that she need not turn into a monster for him. Bella who wears his wolf pendant around her wrist and often seems to find herself wrapped up in his beefy paws seems surprised that Edward is jealous. The comedy of her begging the two Bridget Jones-like to stop as she revels in their fighting over her could have been played up. The digressions and the hokey ""romantic"" parts of the first two movies are mostly absent. The leads have grown into their roles particularly RPatz who at last (after a mere 500 magazine covers) is confident enough to underplay Edward and simply be handsome instead of trying to ""smolder"" with his previously adorable would-be ""intensity."" (Still the ""Twilight"" films are the first blockbusters since ""Tootsie"" in which the leading mans lipstick is a shade brighter than the leading ladys.) Thanks to battles that are fairly well done (though the wolf effects still look cheap) a convincing love triangle and a playful self-awareness the movie has bark as well as bite. But most important it limns the real appeal of the best-selling series of books Two generations after their grandmothers let the chastity horse escape from the barn girls feel sexually besieged and devalued. They ache for old-school boyfriends who beg to get married first naked second (and who might also be made to lie in blooming fields listening to poetry). In a speech soaked in genuine feelings (no 2010 male would ever talk this way which is exactly the point) Edward tells Bella that if he had his way he would court her on chaperoned dates with iced tea on the porch and her father to be asked for her hand in marriage. The woods of Washington will be ruled by vampires and werewolves before this ever again becomes the norm -- which gives ""Eclipse"" the kind of plaintive minor-key undertone lacking in the first two episodes and in most blockbuster movies. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Gimme 1M for TV talk Read Next Gimme 1M for TV talk Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44527 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 21107 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 17704 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson vie for the affections of Kristen Stewart in The Twilight Saga Eclipse (Kimberley French) B+ The Twilight Saga Eclipse Genre Horror Romance; Starring Taylor Lautner Robert Pattinson Kristen Stewart Dakota Fanning Ashley Greene Bryce Dallas Howard Jackson Rathbone; Director David Slade; Author Melissa Rosenberg; Release Date Wide 06/30/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 124; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted June 30 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT The Twilight Saga Eclipse is like some broodingly repressed wide-screen youth-pop melodrama from the 1950s -- and I mean that as a compliment. The story at heart is earnest and humorless teen romantic glop but its feelings arent fake and the movie is compulsively watchable; it has a passionflower intensity. In case you havent been keeping up the plot -- and the blood -- have thickened a lot since the first Twilight film two years ago. In that initial relatively uncomplicated chapter the ever-so-mildly dark and alienated Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) fell for the dashing vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) because of his pasty-faced erotic appeal (sideburns James Dean hair golden eyes eternal stricken look) but also because he offered himself up as the ultimate protector swoony and chivalrous a spangly-skinned knight of the woods who vowed to guard her innocence. In Eclipse adapted from the third novel in Stephenie Meyers girl-power-meets-retro-Harlequin fantasy series Bella now needs to be saved from no one so much as herself. She loves Edward so completely that her fears about his ""otherness"" have been all but dissolved. She cant wait to go over to the undead side and to lose her virginity too -- though Edward ever the gentleman has other ideas. Hell agree to make her a vampire only if she marries him (he seems to propose about every third scene). The more idealized their love becomes the more it attracts danger like the storm clouds roiling over the Pacific Northwest. In Seattle an army of fresh hungry vampires -- ""newborns"" -- has gone on a rampage. Since theyve only just recently been ""converted"" and still have remnants of human blood theyre more ruthless and insatiable than older vamps; their genesis may be revenge but we can sense its ultimate effect -- to destroy Bella and Edward. The other threat to the couples love comes from Jacob Black the snub-nosed Quileute Indian werewolf played with quick responses and a rock-steady gaze by Taylor Lautner whos like the young Matt Damon in the body of Marky Mark. Prior to Eclipse Jacob nurtured his crush on Bella mostly from afar but now he emerges as a furious literally hot-blooded rival for her affection. When she insists that shes with Edward he narrows those dagger eyebrows and basically says You love me -- you just dont know it yet. Which is a little scary. In Eclipse Edward and Jacob square off like two king jocks each devoted to making Bella his prize. Confronted with this much ardent male protection a girl could die. As always Stephenie Meyer is not the most seamless of storytellers. She sets up soap opera horror-movie situations that stutter and ramble forward muffled by those declarations of adolescent devotion and by Bellas own tentative hemming-and-hawing nature. The movie directed by David Slade (Hard Candy) from a screenplay by Melissa Rosenberg attempts to turn the passive Bella into more of an aggressor the brave one who yearns to dissolve Edwards caution. Yet there are moments when Kristen Stewarts acting gets a little too moody and remote. That said she sulks and pines gorgeously and the film though it could have used a sharper narrative coasts along on all that nakedly intense teen emotion. Pattinson like James Dean holds back so much that its cathartic when he finally lets loose. And the battle between the newborn vamps and a coalition of Edwards vampire clan and the werewolves is thrillingly shot and edited. Its not just a war of F/X but a true demon power struggle. The Twilight movies like the books on which theyre based are often mocked. But thats only because were still on some level getting used to the novelty of a highly contemporary blockbuster saga thats this rooted in old-fashioned borderline masochistic girlish romantic rapture. The movie version of Eclipse with its dueling boy-monster hunks -- a chaste orgy of male gazing -- revels in the power that Bella experiences by giving herself over to the powerlessness of love. The movie is about a girls primal dream of being desired. That may well be corny but its also an essential antidote to summer-movie hardware.

"Movie review Eclipse satisfies the feeding frenzy washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Twilight Saga Eclipse Movie review Eclipse satisfies the feeding frenzy Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Friday July 2 2010 Team Edward or Team Jacob? For anyone who has a ready answer to that question the arrival of ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" is as welcome as a northwestern breeze in the middle of a torrid heat wave. And they will most likely feel well rewarded by this respectful unfussy installment of their beloved ""Twilight"" series in which 17-year-old heroine Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) inches ever closer to becoming a vampire and joining her forbidden love Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) forever. Of course there are complications not least among them Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) her childhood friend -- oh and part-time werewolf -- who has a knack for showing up at inopportune moments. ""Doesnt he own a shirt?"" Edward asks mockingly at one point. And its true Jake and his posse give more ab action than the entire cast of ""300"" (with better tattoos). In ""Eclipse"" Bella is also being pursued by the flame-haired Victoria (played by Bryce Dallas Howard in a role originated by the unceremoniously axed Rachelle Lefevre) who is busy amassing an army of ""newborn"" vampires to wreak vengeance on Bella and the whole Cullen clan. But anyone interested in seeing ""Eclipse"" knows this already because like ""Harry Potter"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" the ""Twilight"" movies are designed not as cinematic objects themselves but rather as illustrations of books whose fans approach them with the exegetical seriousness of sacred texts. As such ""Eclipse"" succeeds with honor if not panache moving the story along with economy and focused momentum. As Catherine Hardwicke did in the first ""Twilight"" director David Slade pays close attention to mood and atmosphere a sensitivity that last years ""New Moon"" grievously lacked (somehow both frenetic and plodding it wound up feeling like ""The Da Vinci Code"" mashed up with a feminine-hygiene commercial). With all the talk about the Big Change to come after graduation with Bella longing for physical intimacy with Edward and Edward valiantly resisting the cardinal ""Twilight"" themes of longing chastity and protection are stronger than ever. More deeply psychological than the first two ""Eclipse"" goes further not just in advancing the story but also in illuminating the tension that Bella embodies -- between autonomy and surrender -- and clarifying her desire to become a bloodless being who has no human connections. With Edward she explains at one point she feels ""stronger more real more myself."" Still for characters with such provocative complications Bella and Edward are extraordinarily bland especially channeled by way of Stewart and Pattinsons slurry reticent delivery and resistance to making eye contact. Barely recognizable beneath pale makeup and brown contacts that give her a dilated doll-like stare Stewart registers emotion mostly by looking as if shes just eaten a bad sandwich. The films most animated scene isnt between her and Pattinson but between Pattinson and Lautner as their characters discuss their rivalry with good-natured guy talk. ""Face it Im hotter than you"" Jake says to the cold-blooded Edward. Filmed mostly as a series of close-ups of people talking with occasional flashbacks and blurry nearly incoherent action scenes ""Eclipse"" will look fine on an iPhone which for its teenage audience is probably all to the good. If Slade doesnt necessarily advance the medium with this installment he nonetheless advances the franchise with enough lucidity and skill that hes persuaded at least one erstwhile agnostic to take a stand. Team Jacob all the way. Shirts are overrated.  PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense sequences of action and violence and sensuality. 121 minutes.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint So hot furry and feral Jacob or cool brooding and elegant Edward? ""Eclipse"" the third chapter of the ""Twilight"" series represents every adolescent girls dream. Bella Swan has two super-powerful hunks vying for her affection. Though shes confused by her unsettled feelings Bella is clearly at the top of the love triangle reducing these demigods to helpless whimpering love junkies with the mesmerizing power of her female magnetism. All she has to do is choose Chunky abs or funky eyebrows? Teen wolf or 109-year-old vampire? Of course theres a lot more going on around Forks Wash. Its time for Bellas high school class to graduate and move forward in the world. (One of the clever moments in Melissa Rosenbergs script has one of Edwards ageless clan arrange a celebration ironically observing ""How many times will we graduate from high school?"") And there are reports of mysterious slayings in Seattle. Are they the work of an enterprising serial killer as the TV newscaster speculates or is a vampire army being raised by vengeful vamp Victoria to destroy Edward and his clan? That impending apocalypse is not on the front burner however. The key issue is Bellas headstrong hormonally charged race to surrender her virginity (and humanity) to her sparkly vampire boyfriend. The screenplay tosses her a warning (and throws a wink at viewers) when the valedictorian offers a graduation speech on the wisdom of postponing lifes looming decisions as long as possible. Bella as always the poster girl for teen angst confesses that shes never felt normal justifying her link to her ultimate outsider boyfriends. Shes loyal to Jacob but no matter how often he bares his pecs (""Doesnt he own a shirt?"" Edward huffs) Bella loves his rival a little more. Kristen Stewart has toned down her fidgety mannerisms here signaling a new maturity for her character. Her male costars also fully inhabit their roles as they forge a truce to protect the girl they both love. The producers of the ""Twilight"" films continue to raise the production values directing talent and the quality of the secondary cast. Director David Slade (succeeding Catherine Hardwicke and Chris Weitz) brings an edgier sensibility to the proceedings. In fact after the excellent films ""Hard Candy"" and ""30 Days of Night"" he may be overqualified to helm a movie whose theme is overheated puppy love. Slade uses the amped-up special-effects budget cleverly; the wolves look photorealistic and even emotionally expressive. Slade also puts the stars in sexier situations than before. Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson look quite bedeviled by Stewart whose excitement gauge is revving in the red zone. Edward wants to make an honest woman of Bella before claiming her as his bride; thats the way things were done in his day. Nowadays Bella retorts getting married right out of high school means you got knocked up. The rivalry between Jacobs clan of Native American teen wolves and Edwards coldblooded neck-nibblers is put on hold as the rivals unite against Victoria (played with delicious malevolence by new cast member Bryce Dallas Howard). The flame-haired vamp has turned a terrain-savvy young Forks native into the leader of her attack pack. Like Bella she controls her man with sweet words and steamy glances even in the midst of an epic battle; unlike our heroine Victoria manipulates her marionette only for her own purposes. ECLIPSE  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence and some sensuality. Slade shapes the tales characterization and narrative with a sure hand pausing to fill in the back stories of several vampires. The asides dont feel digressive but add depth and scope to the story. The directors greatest accomplishment comes with the climactic action scenes which boast unexpected scope energy and excitement. Its title notwithstanding ""Eclipse"" is the brightest chapter in the series so far.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Twilight Saga Eclipse Romance-fantasy. Starring Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner. Directed by David Slade. (PG-13. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Oh to be Bella Swan. To be adored by a shirtless werewolf on one side a chivalrous vampire on the other. Other girls her age are stuck between a nerd and a jock and thats if theyre lucky. But Bella (Kristen Stewart) doesnt have much in common with other girls her age. And she doesnt enjoy being worshiped by all this mutant male hunkiness two notable exemplars of which she professes to love in ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" directed by David Slade. Yet she never seems that happy about either of them and is depressed by it all. Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) the abstemious vampire extraordinaire keeps after her to marry him and doesnt smile much himself. Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) the clothing-deprived Quileute shape-shifter thinks Edward stinks - literally figuratively all ways - and resents Bellas plan to become an undead bloodsucker shortly after graduating from high school. To complicate matters an army of freshly minted vampires is eating its way to Bellas home in Forks Wash. They may want to eat her too. Come to think of it she has good cause to be depressed. Its her raison detre. Suffering for love teen-bogeyman-style is the central theme of the ""Twilight"" films and their source material Stephenie Meyers addictive fantasy novels. They were written ostensibly for teens but have been consumed by vast numbers of middle-aged moms who overlook their literary mediocrity in pursuit of a fat emotional payoff. So far the film adaptations have nailed the mediocrity but missed the payoff. ""Eclipse"" continues that trend though it looks sharper and seems a tad more grown-up in the smooching acting and violence departments.

(Courtesy Kimberley French/MCT) Photo Handout MCT Movie review The Twilight Saga Eclipse 1 / 2 Back to Gallery In the second movie ""New Moon"" lovebirds Bella and Edward spent much of the plot separated and glum about it. This time their togetherness is realized onscreen in enormous gummy close-ups that bring a new dimension to eyelashes and facial pores. Not just Bellas and Edwards either; the movie is filled with this tight-squeeze intimacy unfolding as a series of heart-to-hearts between various characters sorting out heavy issues. In between are scenes of hard-driving gothic action as Jacobs pack and Edwards family prepare to do battle with the approaching vampire army. Slade is more at ease with the scenes of ghoulish dismemberment than all that romance which is none too surprising given his resume He brought a wicked-cruel imagination and visual snap to the horror films ""Hard Candy"" and ""30 Days of Night"" the last being a much more graphic bloodsucking saga with much less attractive vampires. Melissa Rosenbergs screenplay is faithful enough to Meyers soap-operatic inclinations but I kind of wish it werent. I kind of wish Bella werent such an indecisive wuss about her feelings. And I know Im in the minority here but I kind of wish Jacob would put on a shirt. -- Advisory Intense sequences of action and violence and some sensuality.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet With roughly 20 minutes of its two-hour running time devoted to characters doing something besides alternately moping and declaring their eternal love for each other Eclipse stands as the most action-packed entry yet in the Twilight series. Unfortunately the trade-off for a whiff of the excitement implied by a vampires-vs.-shapeshifters saga is the expansion of the mundane Twilight universe which means more space devoted to secondary characters who were seemingly cast more for their ability to induce squeals than their acting acumen. This is especially problematic given that Eclipse is exceptionally heavy on dialogue much of it the sort of tormented garment-rending testimony that sounds ridiculous coming out of the mouths of characters who havent yet reached legal drinking age. Eclipse picks up where last years New Moon left off with glitter-vamp Edward (Robert Pattinson) coercing a reluctant Bella (Kristen Stewart) into marrying him. She meanwhile spends half of her time pining for vampire-hating wolf-boy Jacob (Taylor Lautner) in spite of his propensity for borderline-rapey sentiments like ""You love me you just wont admit it."" As if that wasnt enough cause for angst the trio must also face an army of newly made vampires coming to wage war on them and their families. Unlike the series first two entries which packed what little action there was into the last 15 minutes Eclipse breaks up the inert scenes of tedious dialogue with several comparatively exciting sequences featuring vampires and shape-changers doing something other than being dreamy--namely fighting and killing. Though the CGI wolves still look like oversized plush toys new director David Slade (30 Days Of Night) has managed to create a sense of actual menace surrounding the rival vampire covens and the battles between the two factions are much more dynamic than the repetitive glower-snarl-tackle attack method favored in the previous films. But while Eclipses action highs are higher its expositional lows are lower particularly during the numerous scenes featuring Lautner or a newly prominent secondary vampire played by Jackson Rathbone; the two actors seem to be competing over who can turn in the most wooden performance. Thankfully there are a few ringers in the supporting cast like Billy Burke providing comic relief as Stewarts clueless father and a slumming Anna Kendrick who shows more charisma in her few scenes than most of the cast has in the entire series. Eclipse is still a mostly for-fans-only proposition but it has slightly more to offer outsiders than the previous two films in the Twilight saga.

"Movie review The Twilight Saga Eclipse - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-VampireMovie review The Twilight Saga EclipseActors breathe life into characters and the new director keeps things moving in the new installment of the vampire-werewolf saga.June 30 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Anyone worried about the fate of Bella Edward Jacob and the rest of the ""Twilight"" gang after the moody blues of movie No. 2 can breathe a sigh of relief. ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" is back with all of the lethal and loving bite it was meant to have The kiss of the vampire is cooler the werewolf is hotter the battles are bigger and the choices are as everyone with a pulse knows by now life-changing. Its really all because the kids are growing up. Not just Bella Edward and Jacob though theyre doing their share of hitting major milestones what with their love triangle more fraught than ever but Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner who finally finally have figured out how to breathe life into the characters first created by publishing phenom Stephenie Meyer. No doubt the thanks in large part should go to David Slade the latest director in the hot seat and just what the soap opera doctor ordered. Though ""Eclipse"" is not high art the ""Twilight"" series does have its own sort of mystical magic in the way it blends teenage angst with epic political conflicts (vampire-land has just as many turf wars and ridiculously rigid rules as the real world). Slade finds a way to blend the street-smart edge he found in ""Hard Candy"" with the dark irony of ""30 Days of Night"" to bring some serious fun to ""Eclipse."" About time someone mined the humor in these inter-species affairs of the heart.... As the movie opens Victoria ( Bryce Dallas Howard) the flame-haired villainess set on destroying Bella is out creating an army of newborns to take with her into battle. Theyre hungry little suckers under the unruly control of delicious new hunk Riley (Xavier Samuel). Theyre also extremely messy about their feeding needs much to the growing dismay of the living locals in Seattle and the Cullen vampire clan back in Forks. Meanwhile Bella (Stewart) has a few other things on her mind like high school graduation and the whole vampire wannabe issue a with her dreaded 18th birthday looming shell soon be a year older than Edward (Pattinson) and she wants some of that special serum that will halt aging in its tracks (but then dont we all). If for a moment you take the ""should she or shouldnt she become a vampire"" question off the table Bellas issues are as old as time itself Who does she love is she ready to commit forever and what is she willing to sacrifice for it? Thats a lot to chew on but then everyone here has teeth including screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg doing her best yet to channel Meyer while adding some much-needed wryness to the proceedings. Everyone is also very concerned about Bellas virtue Her dad Charlie ( Billy Burke) wants her to be careful Edward wants her to wait until theyre married and Jacob (Lautner) just wants her to wait. While Bella sorts through all of her ""who do you love?"" conflicts the newborns close in a few of the ancient and unpredictable Italian Volturi enforcers show up leaving Edward and Jacob to form an uneasy alliance to protect their damsel in distress. The good news is that all that tension helps ""Eclipse"" eclipse its predecessors. There is a new tenderness and sweetness that Stewart brings to her relationships a more playful with Pattinson more affectionate with Burke (especially when Charlie tries to have ""the sex talk"") and more intense with Lautner. Bella doesnt want to let down anyone and Stewart makes sure she doesnt. But its Lautner in particular who has grown giving Jacob an emotional interior nearly as hard-packed as those abs which are very much on display. Since the swoon factor is significant Slade and director of photography Javier Aguirresarobe are ever mindful of the power of those faces letting the camera go in for the close-up kill whenever it can. As for the rest of the landscape the wonderful Aguirresarobe ( ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" and ""The Sea Inside"") knows how to do luminous and Slade has given him more room to move than he got in ""New Moon."" ""Eclipse"" benefits from it throughout including the rain-drenched lethal nights in Seattle and the extensive vampire smack downs. The action comes in fast and furious waves. Having the werewolves getting their fur ruffled helps since your typical vampire battle is basically a bloodless sport. Dead vampires at least as imagined in ""The Twilight Saga"" have the look of broken Greek statues in a vandalized museum which kind of takes the sting out of things and not in a good way. The same goes for the historical flashbacks that fill in werewolf lore and more about vampire Jasper ( Jackson Rathbone). Enough already. But just when you think everything is going to come apart at the seams someone remembers the money shot and the screen fills with those fine-boned faces of Edward and Bella the music soars and gulp they a| tune in next time kids this soap operas a long way from over. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESTwilight Saga movie marathon to usher in Breaking Dawn...September 10 2012Let Me In vamps till readyJuly 9 2010The Twilight Saga EclipseJanuary 17 2010The Region  Twi-hards ready for New Moon premiere...November 15 2009Michael Sheen relishes vamping it up in New MoonNovember 1 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTVampireTwilight SagaEclipseCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-twilight-eclipse-20100630,0,5344195.story",200,thetwilightsagaeclipse21,thetwilightsagaeclipse,latimes

Unlike New Moon last years installment in the franchise Eclipse lives up to its genre classification of you know thriller.A quick primer The Twilight Saga -Twilight New Moon Eclipse and the forthcoming two-part Breaking Dawn -is based on Stephenie Meyers insanely successful books about a small-town Washington-state teen Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and her two loves sparkly vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and hunky werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner). Vamps and wolves dont get along. Chaos ensues etc.Relatively untested director David Slade (30 Days of Night) was chosen for Eclipse and he proves his worth with a film thats the best of the pack thus far. Its fast-paced witty and uncloyingly sentimental all attributes that director Chris Weitz seemed unable to wrest from the New Moon script. Movie Information The Twilight Saga EclipseRatingShowtimes  IMAX | Official siteDirector David SladeStarring Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Taylor Lautner Bryce Dallas Howard and Dakota FanningRun time 124 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (intense sequences of action and violence and some sensuality)Synopsis Bella Edward and Jacob continue to mope. Bryce Dallas Howard joins the cast as vampire Victoria.Video Fans attend Twilight Night at Victory ParkMore movies from GuideLive.comEclipse picks up essentially where New Moon left off with Edward asking Bella to marry him. She says yes - but only if hell make her a vampire so they can live out the centuries together. He agrees and they set a date for her ""turning"" after high-school graduation. (Dang Shell still have to take finals)All of this would be so romantic (and boring) if not for the nefarious doings of vengeful vamp Victoria whose mate Edward killed. Bryce Dallas Howard taking over the role from Rachelle Lefevre doesnt have much to say (Victoria communicates primarily via snarls) but she looks glorious with her glowing red eyes and Medusa-esque auburn curls a-fly.Slade skips the stultifying slow-motion fantasy sequences that so weighed down New Moon in favor of a well-paced blend of action and introspection. Ironic actually that his action shots work so well because he slows them just a bit enough so that even with all the rapid cuts and flying fangs and fur we can tell whos doing what to whom.Melissa Rosenbergs script convincingly explores its main theme of identity and the actors winningly express typical teen angst that just happens to play out amid a big ol war the Cullen vampires colluding with their longtime enemies Jacobs wolf pack against an army of newborn vamps.Stewarts Bella is far less annoyingly pouty this time around and the competition between Edward and Jacob for her affections is both tense and funny.The screenplay also winks at fans especially in playing off of Lautners hunk status. ""Doesnt he have a shirt?"" Pattinsons Edward wonders aloud at one point. At another critical moment Jacobs werewolf heat is needed to warm up a freezing Bella as the unfortunately cold (you know dead cold) Edward looks on aghast and helpless.""After all I am hotter than you"" Jacob taunts. Point to Team Jacob.Parents should be warned that theres more sexuality in this film although its mostly tight shots of lingering kisses. Theres a hilarious scene in which Bellas dad (Billy Burke) tries to explain the facts of life that will have parents guffawing and teens breaking out in hives.Lets hope Bill Condon (Dreamgirls) whos set to direct both parts of Breaking Dawn follows the Slade pattern. Youd have to tie me down to make me watch New Moon again but Id happily see Eclipse again next week. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

JOHNSON  Post-Dispatch Pop Music Critic gt; kjohnsonpost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8191 Jun 30 2010 (...) Vampires and werewolves and - more vampires. Oh my.Yes Bella Edward and Jacob the most awkwardly angst-ridden movie teenagers ever are back for a fresh go-round of undying love in ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" the third in the wildly popular ""Twilight"" series.""Eclipse"" opens with the mortal Bella (a wig-wearing Kristen Stewart thanks to her haircut for her ""The Runaways"" role) and vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) lying in a picturesque field of flowers enjoying a distinctly PG-rated kiss as he asks her to marry him while a piano ballad plays in the background. If it sounds like near-parody thats because it is.Bella dying to be bitten doesnt commit just yet and for good reason. Shes conflicted over her feelings for hunky werewolf Jacob (a solid Taylor Lautner the true star of this franchise).""Doesnt he own a shirt?"" Edward asks Bella of the often bare-chested Jacob in one of the movies few wink-wink moments. While this love triangle continues heating up in Forks Wash. there is a murderous crime spree unfolding in Seattle. A new breed of bloodsuckers ""newborns"" is being led by fire-haired Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard picking up the role from Rachelle Lefevre). Victorias grudge-filled mission is to kill Bella.""Eclipse"" directed by David Slade (the third in the apparent revolving directors chair) delivers an installment thats mostly on par with last years ""New Moon"" with some improvements but also in need of some improvements. The CGI upgrades are noticeable in the fight scenes and the presentation of the larger-than-life wolves. Slade works flashbacks well unlike the similar ones on ""True Blood"" giving us satisfying if also too-brief backstories of Rosalie (Nikki Reed) and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) and Jacobs family.But the script is still chatty and prone to cliche ""Edward you have to trust me."" / ""I do trust you; its him I dont trust."" The town of Forks is still painfully insulated and teen-driven and the character of Jane (Dakota Fanning) of the Volturi family just silly.And why the bloodsucker and the wolf boy treat Bella as if shes the cats meow is still a mystery.

"Twilight 3 is feeling like same-old | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTwilight 3 is feeling like same-oldAs with most third instalments of a franchise The Twilight Saga Eclipse suffers from an excess of characters and dialogue and a shortage of real plot changes.Moody Bella (Kristen Stewart) is in and out of the protective arms of vampire beau Edward (Robert Pattinson) in The Twilight Saga Eclipse.By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. June 29 2010The Twilight Saga Eclipse (out of 4)Starring Robert Pattinson Kristen Stewart Taylor Lautner and Bryce Dallas Howard. Directed by David Slade. At theatres throughout the GTA. PGTwilight is still at the kissing stage and a bad case of ""bite-us interruptus"" is starting to take hold.As with most third instalments of a franchise (Toy Story 3 being a notable exception) Eclipse suffers from an excess of characters and dialogue and a shortage of real plot changes even with Hard Candys sharp-eyed David Slade at the helm.Article Continued BelowMuch of the ludicrously florid dialogue (""Im going to fight for you until your heart stops beating . . . and maybe beyond"") causes unintentional fits of laughter.But you cant really blame Slade or the movie for staying true to the book -- fans demand it -- and Stephanie Meyers overripe novel is more of a wheel-spinner than a page-turner. This latest screen adaptation should satisfy the rabid faithful even while leaving viewers not born female in the 1990s more mystified than ever about the series appeal.Watching Eclipse is like studying the middle moves of a painfully slow chess game even though theres marginally more fighting for the bloodthirsty to sink their teeth into. (Parental alert that PG rating is awfully tolerant. Heads really roll in this one.)When we last left our hormonal heroes moody Bella (Kristen Stewart) was dithering over whether she loved her brooding vampire beau Edward (Robert Pattinson) or her jealous werewolf suitor Jacob (Taylor Lautner).Shes still pulling those daisy petals causing both the terminally square Edward and the shirtless Jacob to go more than a little squirrelly.Bella is additionally vexing Edward by parrying with his marriage proposal while also insisting that he change her into a vampire.In the second (and better) Twilight film New Moon Bellas loves-me loves-me-not deliberations were violently interrupted by the Volturi an Italy-based clan of vampires led by the suavely evil Aro (Michael Sheen). The Volturi police the affairs of other bloodsuckers and theyre prepared to sic ruby-eyed Jane (Dakota Fanning) on rebels. This pup is small but her bite is definitely worse than her bark.Reckless Edward has flagrantly disobeyed two Volturi rules you dont let humans know your real identity and you dont fall for a mortal. But thats not all thats keeping pale Edward awake days as we see in Eclipse.He has to contend with jealous Jacob and his shape-shifting wolf pack cronies who also have trouble keeping their shirts on.But both Edward and Jacob find common cause in protecting Bella from vengeful vamp Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard replacing the cruelly dumped Rachelle Lefevre) and her army of ""newborns"" freshly minted junior Draculas who really want to draw first blood.The unfortunately named newborns have been terrorizing nearby Seattle as they expanded their ranks and theyre now headed to Forks Wash. the dampest town in America to tussle with the respective clans of Edward and Jacob and to chase Bella who understandably seems to be getting bored with the whole thing.""A bunch of vampires is trying to kill me"" she complains to Jacob.""Same old same old"" he replies.Couldnt have said it better myself. Eclipse gets by just barely but the decision to split the fourth and final Twilight novel Breaking Dawn into two films now seems more than ever as just a craven attempt to suck more cash out of gullible ""Twihards.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

The Twilight Saga Eclipse Director David Slade. Cast Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Taylor Lautner. Rating Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence and some sensuality. RELATED Kellan Lutz talks about modeling in Scottsdale and Eclipse Team Edward vs. Team Jacob Which side are you on? Video/chat Twilight Saga Eclipse premiere in Tempe Preview The Twilight Saga Eclipse Kellan Lutz The early years | Dakota Fanning Spotlight Kristen Stewart Vampire movies | Werewolf movies Vampire vixens| Vampire hunks Im backing Team David as in David Slade the director who has finally managed to breathe some life into the ""Twilight"" series heretofore a deadly dull undead undertaking. ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" the latest in the string of films based on Stephenie Meyers wildly popular series of books is still drippy supernatural melodrama that makes the old ""Dark Shadows"" television series look like ""Romeo and Juliet"" in comparison. Theres only so much anyone can do with a story that plays like something a high-school senior scribbled in the margins of her notebook in English class while she should have been listening to the lecture on ""Beowulf."" But at least Slade (whose previous credits include ""Hard Candy"" and ""30 Days of Night"" and will not alas direct the final two installments) keeps the shoegazing to a minimum among his leads. He also adds - gasp - a sense of self-referential humor. Kristen Stewart back as Bella Swan the human part of the girl-vampire-werewolf triangle that is at the series center is worlds better than she was in ""New Moon"" the previous installment. She moped her way through that film as if vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) had already granted her foremost wish and made her undead. Turns out it was just her acting. Here she shows life - she smiles even as does Edward - and behaves more like a normal teenage girl than before which is to say that she leads both Edward and her best pal Jacob (Taylor Lautner) on. Trust me she tells Edward as she hops on the back of Jacobs motorcycle and zooms off. Ill never love you she tells Jacob whose thoughts Edward can read. And so on and on and on. The question no one seems to be able to answer in this whole Edward vs. Jacob competition is why anyone gets worked up over it since anyone who is passing familiar with the story KNOWS WHOM BELLA CHOOSES. Itll take a while though. Most of the movie is devoted to Bella making a deal with Edward that she will marry him if he will turn her into a vampire and Jacob trying to talk her out of it. But there is also a string of messy murders in nearby Seattle the work of an army of newly minted vampires led by old nemesis Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) who wants revenge on the Cullens and figures the best way to get it is by way of Bella. Newborn vampires as theyre known evidently possess more strength and are much more savage than those who have been dead a while so this is trouble indeed - so much so that an uneasy truce between Edward and Jacob between vampires and werewolves must be formed to protect Bella. Cats and dogs living together ... mass hysteria. For some reason the vampires dress for battle as if theyre in a 1992 Depeche Mode video. We get a couple of flashbacks telling us how some of the lesser Cullens were turned into vampires and the backstory of how the vampire came to be the enemy of the werewolf. We get a glimpse of the Volturi the secret vampire society we first met in ""New Moon"" which allows Dakota Fanning a couple of minutes of screen time. But mostly we get Bella Edward and Jacob. What elevates ""Eclipse"" above the previous ""Twilight"" films is that it doesnt take itself so seriously and Slade doesnt allow his stars to. There are a couple of knowing winks at the popularity of the leads like when Edward looking at the constantly bare-chested (and buff) Jacob asks ""Doesnt he have a shirt?"" Later as Bella freezes inside a tent (long story) Edward knows he cant warm her being dead and all. So Jacob must saying to Edward as he does ""Lets face it - I am hotter than you.""

Rivals for Bella dominate Twilight Saga Eclipse By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / June 29 2010 E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The Twilight Saga Eclipse continues to perpetrate the longest oddest courtship in the history of the movies. She wants him. He wants to wait. This is the third movie in the series and it mitigates its parable for sex abstinence and moral choices with hot vampires and overheated werewolves. You have to commend the peddlers of this particular installment. Theyve squared the metaphors and parallels almost evenly -- bloodsuckers vs. their lupine adversaries lust vs. chastity talking vs. action.""Eclipse which is based on Stephenie Meyers books (there are four) favors discourse over derringdo and since the filmmaking is logy and rhythmless theres also a lot of derringdont. But in a season of lobotomized action spectacles watching three teenagers -- one of whom happens to be as old as the hills -- prattle for two long hours about their feelings is noble. If the first two movies were ""get a room part three is ""get a therapist.Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) remains unsure about whether she loves her vampire suitor Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) more than Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) her frequently topless werewolf protector. At some point Bella finds herself in danger (again or it is ""still?) and needs to be hidden away in a tent with Edward and Jacob. I honestly cant explain why. Meyer blends role-playing fantasy with ""dear diary wishfulness so the plot is necessary even though its baffling -- Bryce Dallas Howard joins the cast as a vengeful vampire and Dakota Fanning reprises her small role as some kind of hooded vampire goth with a nasty case of red-eye.Anyway Bella. As she sleeps in that tent during a storm Edward and Jacob proceed to have a civilized conversation about what she wants needs and feels. Theyre bitter rivals overperforming their attraction to her for the benefit of annoying each other (talk about get a room). I think Bonobo monkeys do the same thing. But for one chilly evening as Jacob warms his sullen beauty in a sleeping bag and Edward looks on flexing his glittering pallor into a silent-movie scowl the two men declare detente to talk with the seriousness and urgency of heads of state. (What else is Bella at this point if not territory in dispute.) Well have to wait until chapter four (parts one and two) to find out which adorable monster gets to plant his flag. Its ""Real World Camp David.In the meantime Bellas horniness seems distressingly neutralized by her pending wedding to Edward. He valiantly withholds his mind-blowing vampire sex until theyre married. (The allegory is compelling but morally speaking remains comically cruel.) Bella just wants to set a date nonetheless despite her feelings for the other guy. As Plan B Lautner has come from behind as more than watchable. Yes he has the body of bachelorette-party entertainment and a face Chester Gould might have drawn. But hes the one person here who seems to mean it when he says his heart aches. Stewart still wears an expectant snarl that says ""I wanna know what love is but increasingly she and Bella feel marginal to the proceedings. Her own speech about who she is and what she wants isnt convincing. Hasnt Bella always known this? Hasnt Jennifer Love Hewitt given the same talk in her Neutrogena ads?These movies are more about the experience of hearing girls and women who should know better holler at the screen. They could just as well be at a concert. Sometimes they scream for Jacob. Others they hoot for Edward. Though oddly rarely for Billy Burke who plays Bellas age-appropriate father. (Ladies hes single and kind of funny; the mustache alone should win him a second date.) The degree to which ""Twilight is an adolescent girls fantasy gives it cultural value. But as fun only the first film which Catherine Hardwicke directed felt attuned to the crucial discovery and denial of sex with a dream boy. The other installments -- David Slade directed this one -- repeat that discovery without truly deepening it not that quality or depth matter under the circumstances. The movies are interesting without ever being good.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

""Some say the world will end in fire"" she says ""some say in ice. From what Ive tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire . . . .""And thats as good (very good) as the writing gets in Eclipse easily the least compelling least fun entry in the saga thus far. Its not long before Bella is declaiming ""Wow thats really pretty"" when Jacob (Taylor Lautner) the wolf boy with abs of steel hands her a token of his love. Or later breaking up one of the frequent spats between her dueling suitors Bella leans in to push Edward and Jacob apart and says ""Stop Im tired of this. From now on Im Switzerland.""As in neutral territory? Or as in neutral delivery? The Twilight stars line-readings have become like Edward and his bloodsucking kin They lack a pulse.To be entirely accurate Eclipse begins in the rain in Seattle with a prologue about a kid from Forks Wash. who gets whizbanged by a vampire. Before long Seattle is overrun by rampaging ""newborns"" - freshly minted Dracs stronger and thirstier than the ones that have been around for centuries. Whats up with that? wonder the Cullen clan back in sleepy Forks. And then Alice (Ashley Greene) the psychic sibling susses things out Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard) ""the Redheaded One"" is creating an army of newborns to take out Bella and the goody-two-shoes vampire family that protect her.So theres the conflict in Twilight Eclipse and the excuse for the climactic rumble in the woods in which the newborns all cool and sinister square off against a wary alliance of vampires and wolves. (The wolves CG creatures twice the size of the human actors are pretty awesome.) And yes Dakota Fanning and her caped and hooded Volturi goth and goofy watch from the sidelines.But all of that is really beside the point. Twilight Eclipse directed in episodic spurts by David Slade a Brit with a nasty teen-sex drama (Hard Candy) and a stylish vampire horror pic (30 Days of Night) to his credit is mostly about Bella mapping out her future.Never mind the valedictory speech delivered by Bellas pal Jessica (Anna Kendrick back on Twilight duty after her winning turn in Up In the Air) - a speech about leaving yourself open to possibilities to experiment to take different paths even if they lead to failure and disappointment. Bella is determined immediately upon graduation to let Edward sink his fangs into her and make her one of the eternals.And Edward is determined to wed Bella before any kind of serious consummation takes place. He actually speaks of ""virtue"" and the sanctity of marriage. (He admits it Hes an old-fashioned guy.)And Jacob is determined to wrest Bella away from Edward. ""Im going to fight for you"" he says. ""I love you"" he says. ""I can give you more than him"" he says.Looked at one way (a guys way?) Twilight Eclipse is really the story of an epic tease. Bella will be canoodling with Edward one minute and then turn around walk a few steps and climb onto Jacobs motorbike the next wrapping her arms around that bare and strapping torso.(Edward quip ""Doesnt he own a shirt?"")The movie is a-teem with this triangular interplay Bella switching back and forth hot and cold causing fits of peevish jealousy for Edward for Jacob. Is it possible to love two people at the same time she wonders. Oh who cares? Ill just drive these guys batty.And then theres the scene in the mountains in a pup tent in the fake snow with Bella shivering from the cold and Edward with a body temperature like a Sub-Zero unable to keep her warm. So Jacob whose body temperature is more like the inside of a microwave snuggles up to save her from frostbite.Of course for the legion of mostly female Twi-hards Bellas dilemma has nothing to do with a guys point of view. The hook and the charm of the Twilight series is that at the center of its universe stands a young singular woman trying to navigate the tricky paths of love and desire of finding and forging her own identity - a struggle compounded perhaps by that broody boy with the alabaster epidermis standing there with an engagement ring gazing deeply from his amber contact lenses.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

(Summit Entertainment) Elizabeth Weitzman Updated Tuesday June 29 2010 301 PM Title Romance and danger propel the third chapter in Stephenie Meyer?agt;??s popular vampire series. With Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson. Director David Slade (204). PG-13 Intense violence sensuality. At area theaters.Human or immortal? Werewolf or vampire? Marriage or college? These are the kinds of choices Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) faces in David Slades fast-paced ""Eclipse"" the third chapter in Stephenie Meyers beloved ""Twilight"" saga.You however have no such dilemmas because you decided a long time ago whether Bellas tangled love life is of any interest. And theres nothing in Slades straightforward adaptation that will change your mind. If you adore Meyers characters already youll be thrilled to spend more time with them. If you dont well youd just end up sitting among a bunch of sighing teens (and their moms) wondering what the fuss is about.As any one of those die-hard fans could tell you its all about love Do the dangers of a potentially eternal romance with undead Edward (Robert Pattinson) outweigh the practical comforts provided by loyal Jacob (Taylor Lautner)? Life with Edward is hard; not only is he a vampire but hes got to be the moodiest boyfriend in history. Jacob might turn into a werewolf now and then but hes steady and reliable.Plus he loves to take his shirt off. Edward may be Bellas soul mate but Jacob definitely spends more time at the gym. Kristen Stewart (l.) and Robert Pattinson go from angst to anger in The Twilight Saga Eclipse. (Summit Entertainment) Are you swooning yet? Dont scoff; Slade - who imports some of the darkness from his last vamp thriller ""30 Days of Night"" - knows just how to reach his audience alternating suspense and romance in carefully precise degrees. It may not be the subtlest approach but it is effective.He and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg also find ways to broaden the series scope incorporating slightly more opportunity for the supporting players (including Bryce Dallas Howard and Dakota Fanning as especially vicious vampires).Most important Bella and Edward are allowed a wider range of emotions than weve seen before; as a result Stewart and Pattinson finally appear fully comfortable in their roles (though Lautner once again proves the standout working hard to make Bellas decision a difficult one).The truth is almost everyone planning to see ""Eclipse"" will know how things end before the opening credits even appear. So Slade and his cast can be proud that they consistently keep us involved anyway. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

(AP Photo/Summit Entertainment Kimberley French) / APShare Photo A moon-eyed teen must choose between her vampire lover and her werewolf pal a decision she faces amid the ever-simmering rivalry between bloodsuckers and lycanthropes. Wait a sec arent we right back where we were last year on this whole ""Twilight Saga"" thing? Chapter three ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" seems on its surface to be nothing more than a retread of last years retread ""The Twilight Saga New Moon."" Yet with the franchise under new management again this time director David Slade (best known for the hard-core vampire horror flick ""30 Days of Night"") and a stronger story than the first two ""Eclipse"" manages to do what its dreadfully dumb predecessors could not. It almost makes believers out of those of us who dont much care whether Kristen Stewarts Bella Swan chooses vampire stud Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) or werewolf hunk Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner). Almost. The trouble is while ""Eclipse"" may not be dreadfully dumb its still pretty dumb. Slade and his collaborators use that to their advantage here and there lightening up on the relentless gloom of the first two movies by making fun of some of the franchises silliness (why not slip in your own wisecrack about Lautners constant shirtlessness rather than letting the audience snicker on its own each time he shows off his torso?). Still the filmmakers made ""Eclipse"" for the ""Twilight"" faithful so while the movies a bit more light on its feet it wallows in what fans love most that whiny romantic triangle among a schoolgirl and her two beastie boys. This time around Bellas dealing with all those transitional developments teens face - high school graduation saying goodbye to classmates whether or not to let her boyfriend turn her into a vampire so they can stay young beautiful and broody together forever. Her still-chaste dalliance with Edward and friendship with Jacob take on new strains as the Cullen vampire clan and the local werewolf pack join forces to battle the Newborn Army which is far more formidable than the diaper brigade the name implies. The Newborn Army is made up of newly bred vampires - who in author Stephenie Meyers fantasy realm are at their most powerful and bloodthirsty when fresh off the showroom floor. Of course the newborns are coming after Bella as is her old enemy evil vampire redhead Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard taking over the role played by Rachelle Lefevre in the first two movies). And a band of Volturi the uppercrust snobs of the vampire world also are on the trail led by Dakota Fanning in a slightly expanded role after her blink-and-youll-miss-her appearance in ""New Moon."" The cast of vamps and wolfies is getting too big to mention everyone but all the key players are back with Nikki Reed and Jackson Rathbone of the Cullen clan stepping up this time with some nice flashbacks detailing their vampire origins. With returning screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg delivering her sharpest adaptation yet Slade keeps the rather episodic story moving at a good clip though things still bog down often enough in the same old routine. Bella begging Edward to turn her into a vampire Jacob pleading with Bella to fall for him Edward snarling at Jacob to stay away from his woman Jacob snarling back. The stars remain a boring threesome Stewart limping through supposedly impassioned speeches as though Bella already were one of the cold-blooded undead. Pattinson and Lautner at least have perfected their shallow mugging and one-upping and theyre clearly having fun as Edward and Jacob try to out-sneer each other. But enough quibbling. Meyers millions of fans know what they want in a good ""Twilight"" movie and they are going to love ""Eclipse."" The bad news for fans Only one more book left to bring to the big-screen. The good news Meyers fourth installment ""Breaking Dawn"" is being split into two movies. More bad news Theyll have to wait longer between chapters with part one of ""Breaking Dawn"" due in theaters Nov. 18 2011. More good news Bill Condon the guy behind the clever ""Frankenstein""-themed ""Gods and Monsters"" is directing the last two movies. With the sharp improvement in part three could ""The Twilight Saga"" actually grow a brain for its finale?

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Jun. 29 2010 1101AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Jun. 30 2010 306PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Twilight Saga Eclipse Directed by David Slade Written by Melissa Rosenberg Starring Kristen Stewart Robert Pattison and Taylor Lautner Anyone who has followed the Twilight series knows that heroine Bella Swan is a young woman caught in an awful erotic dilemma She wants to sleep with her dreamboat vampire lover Edward but if he gets too turned-on he just might sink his teeth in her and vampirize her by accident. Pedestrian types might think of practical solutions for her problem (a Hannibal Lecter-style no-biting mask? Condoms for fangs?) but that would miss the point. Devotees of Stephenie Meyers immensely popular Twilight books and the previous two hit movies understand that Bella and Edwards dilemma is spiritual not a prurient practical problem. Their story is about a quest for human love that transcends death. A secondary concern raised by Edwards athletic romantic rival raises another eternal question Beauty or Hotness? The faithful will be relieved to know that The Twilight Saga Eclipse introduces no vulgar innovations to the story or for that matter respite from Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattison) putting their retinas at risk with the intensity of their yearning gazes. As well as continuity there are some welcome new developments. The Twilight series has maintained the same writer (Melissa Rosenberg) and producers and cast from the beginning and now by the third movie has a distinct shape and rhythm. Theres the alternation between talky melodramatic scenes and horror suspense a hip soundtrack (Muse Metric Vampire Weekend) and lots of aerial shots of highways running through forests. Stewart with her boyish slouch and deadpan delivery embodies the alienated teen disposition thats at the centre of the story but theres more than just attitude here. All the young actors are maturing and expanding their ranges. Stewart for example shows more vulnerability and Taylor Lautner as Jacob the buff werewolf rival for Bellas affections has a conflicted character whose tenderness and animal aggression are at odds. As for Pattinson the best news after the last movie when he was mostly absent is simply that he and those cheekbones get so much screen time again. Altogether Eclipse feels painted on a bigger canvas than the previous two movies. Those films were released for the American Thanksgiving; this is a summer movie adding more action and horror elements into the supernatural love-triangle plot. New director David Slade ( Hard Candy 30 Days of Night) sets the new films more aggressive tone at the outset with the opening scene on a rainy dark Seattle street where a young man is suddenly attacked chased down to the docks and then attacked again by an invisible vampire. Throughout Slade uses more outdoor locations more handheld camera work and rapid editing. There are also two sustained historical flashbacks when Edwards vampire friends tell Bella about their long-ago human lives. And theres some humorous relief in Bellas exchanges with her affectionate clueless cop dad (Billy Burke) and dealing with day-to-day high-school life. While her friend (Anna Kendricks) is figuring out what to say for her valedictory speech Bella is trying to decide what will become of her eternal soul. Picking up from where The Twilight Saga New Moon left off Bella has decided she wants Edward to turn her into a vampire so they can live together forever but first she wants to sleep with him. Parental guidance warning Horizontal fondling is achieved but Edwards century-old mores and concerns about breaking into a feeding frenzy keep her in a holding pattern as a virgin on the verge. As well his habit of lying to protect Bella pushes her from him. The much hotter Jacob (hes even shirtless during an icy mountain-top kiss thats a shoo-in for next years MTV Movie Awards) promises Bella a warm-blooded normal relationship. Fortunately a new external threat breaks us out of the holding pattern as the two rivals decide to join forces to protect her. Edwards nemesis Victoria (a suitably wraith-like Bryce Dallas Howard) has created an army of ""new-borns"" dangerously reckless recently-bit vampires that are determined to get Bella. The climactic sequence involving close-combat-trained vampires and leaping gigantic wolves in a forest glade is fierce and efficiently brisk. The CGI work is the best so far in the series (the wolves look both menacing in action and cuddly in repose). With the bigger story and more fully developed relationships than the previous films this is the first Twilight film that feels like a real movie in its own right not just a spin-off from a mass literary cult.

"The Twilight Saga Eclipse | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies The Twilight Saga Eclipse ""Eclipse"" the third installment of the wildly popular ""Twilight Saga"" gets a boost from a darker tone and better acting but it still misses the mark. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez6/28/2010 Editor rating 2.5 Eclipse the third of five movies that will eventually comprise The Twilight Saga conclusively proves the series will never be more than its marketable hook a love story geared for young adolescent girls populated by innocuous wimpy monsters. For all the potential inherent in Stephenie Meyers premise - and there is or was tremendous potential in the story of the teenaged Bella (Kristen Stewart) in love with the vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) - Eclipse like its two predecessors is ham-fisted and obvious a mass-market entertainment with a frustrating lack of imagination anemic plotting (how were those novels so fat?) and no aspirations toward anything greater than box office ka-ching. That Twilight has already attained formidably and will repeat with this new chapter in which Bellas love for her fanged boyfriend is clouded by the persistent wooings of the werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner) who wont take no for an answer. Their love triangle forms the center of the movie; surrounding it is some business about a brewing war between vampires and werewolves that results in the most anti-climactic battle between monsters ever captured on film. Director David Slade proved he can sling the gory frights with 30 Days of Night but hes constricted by that pesky PG-13 rating which must be rigorously observed so as to not scare off the demographic being courted. Eclipse is a tad darker than the previous pictures - the occasional arm is ripped off and so are heads - but there were moments in Toy Story 3 that were scarier than anything here. As far as its horror elements go The Twilight Saga continues to be curiously bloodless literally and figuratively. What the new movie does do well is bring the heat back into the touching relationship between Bella and Edward which had grown dangerously cold and silly in New Moon. The acting in Eclipse is noticeably improved from the last movie. The clock may be ticking on Lautners 15 minutes and he continues to have trouble keeping his shirt on but the actor no longer seems to be reading off cue cards as the heartbroken Jacob. We learn a bit more history about Edwards makeshift vampire family performed by an ensemble of actors that continues to develop a growing enjoyable rapport Theyre great fun to watch play off each other. But the heart of The Twilight Saga rests of course between Stewart and Pattinson and the actors regain the emotionally touching vibe they shared in the first movie. Bella has agreed to marry Edward on the condition that he turn her into a vampire something hes mulling over. In the films best scene she pushes him to have sex with her so she can feel what its like while shes still human and in the ensuing groping and confused hesitation Eclipse successfully channels its monsters-and-teens scenario into a metaphor for the awkward terrifying rites of adolescence on the cusp of adulthood. Soon though its back to computer-generated werewolves and Dakota Fanning with red contact lenses looking dour. But Id be lying if I said Eclipse didnt leave me curious as to what happens next. For the legions who have read Meyers novels thats the equivalent of a home run. Cast Kristen Stewart Robert Pattinson Taylor Lautner Billy Burke Anna Kendrick. Director David Slade.

Keep your shirt on Eclipse isnt that awesome Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Kimberley French Summit Entertainment Isnt it romantic? Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) lay it on pretty thick in the third installment of Twilight By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Twilight Saga Eclipse (  out of four) the third film based on Stephenie Meyers wildly popular vampire novels is pretty much more of the same. TRAILER Catch a glimpse of Eclipse FORAY INTO FORKS Visit the Washington State towns of Twilight fame DECLARE YOUR ALLEGIANCE Are you on Team Edward or Team Jacob? GALLERY The three stars before Twilight Team Jacob is still hotter. Actor Taylor Lautner spends most of the movie shirtless as Jacob Black -- when hes not shape shifting into a hulking wolf. Robert Pattinsons brooding vampire Edward Cullen. still has the better hair and more dramatic lips -- distractingly ruby-red at times. And Kristen Stewarts Bella Swan the object of their affection is much less morose than in the earlier films. This may be because there is some steamy kissing with both Edward and Jacob. This is definitely the most romantic of the films although some of these scenes are set in flower-filled meadows that bring to mind feminine-hygiene commercials. The action sequences are harder-edged and occasionally exciting especially the scenes of vamps who sprint and run in mid-air as if in flight. But its still hard to see what all the fuss over ordinary Bella is about. And that inexplicable fuss is at the core of a love triangle introduced in the second film and drawn out in this one. Bella really loves Edward and sort of loves Jacob. Its high school after all. Still shes not exactly torn between two lovers. Despite some potent chemistry with Jacob Edward is the guy for Bella and shes willing to become undead to prove it. Scenes in which she conveys a subtle sadness over her impending ""change"" are among the movies best but they are short-lived. Mostly theres a lot of nonsense about a vampire army of ""newborns"" who have been recently transformed and are more violent and unpredictable for it. We are shown more of the historical lineage of the Cullen family of vampires and a bit of lore about Jacobs Quileute tribe. But these back stories are fleeting and presented in a cliched pastiche style. While director David Slades unnerving psychological drama Hard Candy (2005) was fascinating in its unpredictability he is hampered here by Meyers leaden plot adapted like the previous ones by Melissa Rosenberg. Early scenes have a gritty tension but the rest of the movie with its slow pacing and lackluster cinematography doesnt live up to that initial promise. An appearance by the Italy-based vampire powerbrokers the Volturi (led by Dakota Fanning) feels tacked on. Edwards courtly wooing of Bella has its charms. ""Youll always be my Bella"" he tells her sweetly. Jacob has an appealingly friendly bluster and some of the best quips. He comes to Bellas rescue on a snowy mountainside where she lays in a tent shivering uncontrollably. Edward whose skin shimmers and has a marble texture is powerless to help her. But Jacob whose body temperature runs toasty gallantly offers to warm her up. ""Lets face it Im hotter than you"" he tells his rival and the audience laps it up. The huge contingent of girls -- and women with girlish fantasies -- who liked the first two movies will doubtless enjoy Eclipse. But this third go-round wont make Twihard converts of the rest of us. (Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence and some sensuality; running time 2 hours and 4 minutes. Opens at midnight in select cities and nationwide on Wednesday.)

It goes without saying that the faithful will devour ""The Twilight Saga Eclipse"" the third movie in Stephenie Meyers immensely popular supernatural love-triangle saga and also the one in which Bella must finally choose between her two beastly suitors. The pleasant surprise this time around is that the result finally feels more like the blockbuster this top-earning franchise deserves. Employing a bigger budget better effects and an edgier director (""Hard Candys"" David Slade) ""Eclipse"" focuses on what works -- the stars -- even as the series parent-friendly abstinence message begins to unravel. Summer release should reap Summits biggest yield yet. Taking a cue from the ""Harry Potter"" series which maintains continuity on the writing and casting fronts while introducing a different feel with each change of director the ""Twilight"" producers have embraced a variety of different visions behind the camera. Capitalizing on her indie sensibility and keenly observed teen insights Catherine Hardwicke set the tone with the low-budget first film with Chris Weitz expanding (and flattening) the world with his broader daytime soap-opera style in ""New Moon."" Now the task falls to Slade who clearly understands how to work with actors while also demonstrating a welcome competence in the action and melodrama departments. Its no easy task taking a piece of material auds already know inside-out and spinning it in such a way that individual scenes still generate tension and suspense. Slade sets us on edge from the outset with an atmospheric vignette merely alluded to in the book as small-town boy Riley (Xavier Samuel) is ambushed and bitten by an unseen vampire in shadowy Seattle (looking every bit as ominous as Tim Burtons Gotham City). Not much happens for the first 300 pages of Meyers novel during which vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) vie for the affections of Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) with our increasingly impatient heroine determined to surrender both her virginity and her humanity to the brooding bloodsucker (to his credit Bellas 109-year-old boyfriend wants to marry her first). Slade and screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg wisely intercut these puppy-love scenes with uneasy horror-movie jolts. After all ""Eclipse"" builds not to a showdown between Edward and Jacob (no matter how often he takes off his shirt the poor wolfboy will never be Bellas first choice) but to an uneasy alliance between the Cullen clan and Jacobs tribe of shape-shifters united to protect Bella from the vengeance-seeking Victoria (Bryce Dallas Howard taking over the role from Rachelle Lefevre) and her army of ""newborns"" undisciplined but super-strong new vampires. Rather than attempting to elevate Meyers swoony prose to the level of literature (the poor scribe exhausts herself trying to find synonyms for ""perfection"") Rosenbergs task is to faithfully adapt the material for fans in such a way that works onscreen; that means having the freedom to remove reorder or completely rewrite certain passages. She also has to contend with ""Eclipses"" muddled message -- Bellas in a hurry to be bitten while everyone else is telling her to slow down -- and devises a nice graduation speech for best friend Jessica (Anna Kendrick) on the merits of not rushing into things. Despite the somewhat simple-minded source the producers plot everything as if it were a strategic game of chess paying off earlier gambles -- Jacob played third wheel in the past but gets the sexier kiss here -- while seeding future films. Of particular interest is a wide-eyed young newborn (played by Jodelle Ferland) subject of Meyers spinoff novella ""The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner"" who serves as an effective tool in setting up the powerful Volturis villainy for the two-part ""Breaking Dawn"" finale. ""Eclipse"" feels the most cinematic of the series so far taking scenes out of the lunchroom and Swan house as much as possible. Slade shares Hardwickes aesthetic of using dramatic aerial photography to give the otherwise intimate tale a more epic sweep and expands on it by repeatedly lining up the various clans like the subjects of a Vanity Fair cover shoot their iconic group poses helping to make the movie seem as big as its following. Though Slade inherits ""New Moon"" d.p. Javier Aguirresarobe his choice of lenses and shooting style (including a fair amount of handheld camerawork) gives things a more dynamic energy. Visual effects have improved considerably with no fewer than 11 companies working on everything from Edwards sparkling skin to CG wolves that realistically blend with live-action characters. A scene of Bella side-by-side with canine Jacob feels perfectly plausible but nothing beats the sight of vampires and werewolves going at it in the climactic battle. If anything the digital work outshines the other departments with bad makeup lifeless wigs and creepy contacts being the elements that disrupt the fantasy.
