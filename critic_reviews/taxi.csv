Comments Taxi Inept behind the wheel of a car eager cop Jimmy Fallon (from Saturday Night Live) commandeers a supercharged taxi driven by Queen Latifah. Throw in a team of fashion-model bank robbers and a police force of mind-numbing incompetence and you get a noisy Hollywood crash-em-up hustled from one scene to the next by a series of pop-music cues. I expected this to be much funnier Latifah coasts on her charm and Fallon seems incapable of playing an actual character. Tim Story (Barbershop) directed. PG-13 100 min.

Scalping is too good for deluded Barbershop director Tim Story who claims the chemistry-free collision between Queen Latifahs rookie New York cabby and ex-Saturday Night Live comedian Jimmy Fallons crash-prone cop is a gender-bending deconstruction of buddy comedy conventions. Belle (Latifah) drives a souped-up taxi and dreams of becoming a racing driver. Instead she ends up playing chauffeur to disgraced cop Andy Washburn (Fallon) who drives like a man in need of a white stick. Together they chase the gorgeous gang of BMW-driving bank robbers led by leggy Brazilian uberbabe Vanessa (supermodel Gisele Bundchen). Handily Belle speaks the thieves lingo because - wait for it - she used to deliver for a Portuguese takeaway. Convinced? You wont be.The Luc Besson-scripted original mixed exciting expertly staged car chases with perfunctory characterisation and dialogue the former compensating in part for the latter. This remake doesnt even manage that the obvious use of blue screen undercuts any sense of jeopardy or excitement since we never believe Belle and Washburn are actually in a moving vehicle.Despite scene-stealing supporting roles in Living Out Loud and Chicago the multi-talented Latifah falls flat on her beautiful face; the charisma-free Fallon may regret leaving SNL; and Ann-Margrets cameo as Fallons Margarita-muddled mother is both sad and embarrassing. In one pitifully unfunny scene Latifah and Fallon accidentally inhale laughing gas. It would take a tankerload of laughing gas to pump some humour into this flat-tyred fiasco.

With his un-glib delivery and slacker hair in need of a good combing he came across not like a blow-dried TV personality but like the smirking drinking buddy from the group house next door. He was always at his best with a quip or riffing like some Robin Williams manque (way way manque) on the cultural zeitgeist. Unfortunately what made him great on ""SNL"" -- the fact that he was no movie star -- makes him a terrible movie star. Even Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon cant steer ""Taxi"" in the right direction. (Kerry Hayes -- Twentieth Century Fox) _____More in Movies_____  Taxi Details  Watch the Trailer  Current Movies Openings  Fall Film Guide  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now His first starring vehicle ""Taxi"" goes nowhere fast. Teamed up with Queen Latifah who plays a daredevil New York cabbie whose vehicle is commandeered by his inept carless cop Fallon is hot on the high heels of a quartet of Brazilian supermodel bank robbers (Giselle Bundchen Ana Cristina de Oliveira Ingrid Vandebosch and Magali Amadei playing vapid angry and beautiful which is never a good combination). As officer Andy Washburn Fallon essentially tries the same trick that worked so well for him on TV which is to say he plays himself. Aside from delivering a few cute bits though -- imitating ""The Lord of the Rings "" Gollum breaking gamely but lamely into Natalie Coles ""This Will Be (An Everlasting Love)"" and affecting a heavy Cuban accent during an undercover sting operation -- theres just not enough of ""himself"" to go around on the big screen. He seems slight insubstantial and not just when standing next to his large-and-in-charge co-star. The movies heartbeat does pick up a bit when it gets behind the wheel -- Queen Latifahs Belle is a speed demon in her souped-up Crown Vic -- but for a movie called ""Taxi"" it spends a strangely inordinate amount of time pounding (and pounding) the beat. I never thought Id say this but this buddy film could have used a few more car chases and a few less scenes of Belle and Andy saying ""trust me"" to each other. After Belles car is impounded as evidence and whenever the bad girls candy-apple red BMW is idling at the site of their latest heist the movie stalls out completely. Heres the weirdest thing. During the closing credits director Tim Story runs a bunch of outtakes and bloopers many of which feature Fallon doing what he does best. In other words hes seen cracking up his cast mates over and over again as he does when he jokes after inhaling nitrous oxide that his gas-altered voice makes him sound like ""Barry Whites illegitimate grandson."" Its a shame that the movie couldnt capture that sense of joyous on-the-fly wisecracking. TAXI (PG-13 97 minutes) -- Contains some obscenity mild sexual innuendo shooting and reckless driving.

Failing to improve on the inept but hugely successful (in Euro markets) 1998 Luc Besson vehicle also named ""Taxi"" new pic commits any number of comedic violations during an aimless pursuit of laughs. A complete non-starter for ex-""Saturday Night Live"" regular Jimmy Fallons movie career buddy cop pic stuffs enough car chases and crack-ups in 90-plus minutes to draw strong crowds in opening five-day slot. Vid spin will be in fifth gear. Based on a simple story -- a hapless New York cop who stinks at driving joins forces with a skilled cabby to nail a ring of bodacious Brazilian bank robbers -- pic marks an interesting cultural crossroads. The original ""Taxi"" was a direct Gallic response to American urban action movies in the same way that ""Seven Samurai"" was a direct Japanese response to the American Western. U.S. remake tries to retain the originals essence while returning the genre to home turf. Choice of this remake (adapted by a trio of screenwriters from Bessons script) is curious because neither the original nor its two sequels ever made it Stateside theatrically or on vid. New ""Taxis"" entire appeal is on the drawing power of co-stars Fallon and Queen Latifah who may have had a ball on the ""SNL"" set but flail in a gray zone of underwritten comedy and desperately pitched improv. Pic begins with a charming joke After a wild opening bike ride through Gotham biker rips off helmet to reveal ... Latifah as daredevilish Belle. Early minutes almost exactly mirror the originals with Belle given a warm send-off on her last day on the job before she gets her license to drive a New York City taxi. Differences with Bessons material begin to emerge with Fallons entry as profoundly klutzy and lunk-headed cop Washburn. Unlike Frederic Diefenthals Emelien in the first ""Taxi"" who cant drive at all but whos at least a competent cop Fallons Washburn makes Inspector Clouseau look like a genius  with neither he nor director Tim Story attempting to create a guy who could plausibly be on the police force. Universally known by his comrades as a loser and barely tolerated by boss and ex-g.f. Lt. Marta Robbins (Jennifer Esposito) Washburn is such a washout that he steers the entire movie off the road. Washburn and Belle meet cute while he pursues a gang of female (and gorgeous and leggy) Brazilian bank robbers. Washburn commandeers Belles taxi for the chase. Yank version works very hard to amp up the danger and humor -- Washburn and Belle are captured by the thieves and end up in a room full of laughing gas -- while tiresomely overplaying the old routine of the hero cop being on the outs with his department and going outside the law to get the job done. In an unsuccessful variation from the original Ann-Margret appears as Washburns permanently drunk mom (she has no character name) Bessons original mother character was actually a charming matron. Washburns out-of-left-field deductions that crack the case signal that this is a script where anything goes and nothing really matters except perhaps for the extremely brave team of drivers helmed by stunt coordinators Thomas Robinson Harper G.A. Aguilar Russell Solberg and Brian Smrz. They leave a deeper impression than a cast on autopilot. Even the usually vivacious Latifah appears uninspired if not downright perplexed when dealing with Fallons haphazard improv. Vance Burberry makes a solid d.p. feature debut with muscular widescreen lensing amplified by Stuart Levys all-pro editing. Location scouts in audience will have a hoot observing how locales suddenly shift block to block from New York to Los Angeles and back again. NASCAR fans are thrown a bone in final scene with an uncredited cameo by Jeff Gordon. TaxiProductionA Twentieth Century Fox release of a Europacorp/Robert Simonds production. Produced by Luc Besson.

Queen Latifahs taxi driver helps bumbling cop Jimmy Fallon chase down the most unlikely band of bank robbers since the surfers in Point Break. 20th Century Fox Queen Latifahs blend of quick sassy comedy and knowing facial expressions makes the movie. Jimmy Fallon acquits himself just fine in his first lead role in a film since leaving Saturday Night Live last season. But the movie really belongs to Latifah Ann-Margret who is hilarious as Fallons lush of a mom and the quartet of actresses as Brazilian bank robbers who look more like supermodels than crooks. The movie opens with an edge-of-the-seat bicycle chase that sets the tone for this fast-paced film. Latifah plays a speed demon of a bike messenger who gets her taxi license a mere way station to her dream of NASCAR racing. She has spent five years souping up her Crown Victoria which can get from midtown Manhattan to JFK airport in remarkable time. She also has a stud of a boyfriend and a good life. In contrast Fallons character is an affable loser. Hes a cop with the lethal combination of being both bumbling and over-eager. Hes also a terrible driver whose license has been revoked. When he hears of a bank robbery in progress he enlists the help of Latifahs cabby. After surviving the wild ride he persuades her to team up with him to pursue the leggy crew of thieves. Credit the pairing of the two unlikely leads and the surprisingly humorous performance of Ann-Margret for making Taxi work so well. The movie also turns the whole cliched notion of ""women drivers"" on its ear because Latifah and the head Brazilian robber (Gisele Bundchen) could give Mario Andretti a run for his money. What may seem like a formulaic action comedy breaks sufficiently from the mold and offers enough real belly laughs -- along with some stomach-churning chases -- to qualify as diverting escapist fare.

Photo Credit Kerry Hayes/Twentieth Century Fox ... more Personalities of Latifah Fallon drive screwball plot of Taxi 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Taxi Comedy. Starring Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah. Directed by Tim Story. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) How one likes ""Taxi"" has everything to do with how one responds to the hapless cop character played by Jimmy Fallon. If this action comedy has any spark of originality its contained in that character whos an idiot but not the usual kind of idiot. Hes not a lovable idiot or a funny idiot but an idiot as one might find in life -- struggling to assert himself and swinging wildly from diffidence to dangerous decisiveness without a moments warning. Its a role that could make Fallon come across in the eyes of some viewers as a little on the irritating side but still the character is interesting and believable as more than a comic construction. Real laughs come in pairing this hapless but determined fellow with Queen Latifah who brings to ""Taxi"" her usual warmth and brass and skepticism. This time Latifah plays the comic straight man and shes good at it. In comic terms shes much better cast as the immovable object than as the irresistible impulse (""Bringing Down the House""). She plays Belle the fastest taxi driver in New York City who has equipped her cab with the kind of accessories that Vin Diesel made famous in ""The Fast and the Furious."" Washburn (Fallon) is an undercover cop whose career has been hampered by the fact that hes a terrible driver. Chasing crooks in an early scene he leaves his car in reverse and takes out a building. The inevitable meeting comes when the cop relieved of his drivers license hears a police call for a bank robbery only two blocks away. He hops into Belles cab and has her drive him to the scene. After the robbers get away circumstances throw the cop and the cabdriver together and they start trying to find the bank robbers independent of a police and FBI investigation. Things go by so quickly in ""Taxi"" that its almost possible not to notice that Belle really has no compelling reason to pursue the bank robbers or spend time with our hero. But inevitably one does notice this and from then on one cant stop noticing. Likewise the viewer will notice that even though the movie is about driving the car chases (of which there are several) are lackluster and fairly unconvincing. In a few shots the cars dont even seem to be going fast and the driving moves are prosaic. However there may be a good side to this. Director Tim Storys heart is not in the chase scenes. He is much more interested in conversation scenes that showcase extreme personalities. In one of those the cop takes the driver to his mothers house -- and the mother (Ann-Margret) turns out to be a cheerful eccentric raging drunk. The scene matches the tone of Storys film ""Barbershop"" where the peripheral characters are parodies or distortions of recognizable archetypes. But ""Barbershop"" had a wonderful touch of madness to it. ""Taxi"" has only a sense of fun. Its a formula picture with enough laughs to get by. I particularly liked Fallon in his first minutes onscreen trying extravagantly to convince a Cuban gang that he is from Cuba too. -- Advisory Sex humor and violence.

Taxi his schlocky-as-I-wanna-be debut as a movie star is such a rusty vehicle that it might as well have been a showcase for Rob Schneider or Chris Kattan. How funny is Andy Washburn the New York cop played by Fallon with a boyishness so casual it looks as if he barely memorized his lines? Hes so funny that hes...a really bad driver. Are you laughing yet? Stripped of his license Washburn teams up with Belle (Queen Latifah) a sassy brassy bossy funky taxi driver who zigzags through traffic jams at 100 miles per hour. Stuck in the passenger seat Fallon screams he does lame bits in ""black"" dialect (""By the time we call it in that soupa be cold"") he chirps along with Natalie Coles ""This Will Be"" in what may be the uncoolest hipster-karaoke routine in the history of buddy comedies. He does everything but carry a placard that reads ""Help If I knew they were gonna have two chicks anchor Weekend Update I would never have left the show"" Like a lot of people I have such affection for Fallon that I root for him to be great. Yet why would a performer with this much going for him -- speedball wit devil-choirboy looks that celebrated cameo in Almost Famous -- squander his appeal on Taxi an action-choked dud in which even the closing outtakes barely deserve to be left on the cutting-room floor? If this is going Hollywood please send Jimmy Fallon somewhere else.

Taxi Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2004) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/taxi-2004,200,taxi19,taxi,rogerebert
"Even with Latifah driving Taxi doesnt get far - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Even with Latifah driving Taxi doesnt get far By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 6 2004 If youre an actor who doesnt rap as much as you used to keeping it real must be a pain in the neck. How do Will Smith Ice-T Mos Def and LL Cool J stay street while being rich enough to own several?Its a classic question on the hip-hop quiz but Queen Latifah doesnt seem to care. Since she cut back on her rapping shes starred in a sitcom hosted a talk show received an Oscar nomination done a number of forgettable regrettable movies MCd VH-1s ""Diva Duets"" just released a fine standards album that makes Norah Jones seem like Courtney Love and this weekend will host (and sing on) ""Saturday Night Live.""If people think her idea of keeping it real means shes living in the Matrix fine. Shes also the star of the dollar-bin action sitcom ""Taxi"" and youre not. So there. ""Taxi"" casts Latifah as Belle Williams a motormouth cabbie and NASCAR hopeful and then prays for comedy. For the most part she delivers. Latifahs smooth performances in ""Living Out Loud"" and ""Chicago"" suggested an heir of Pearl Baileys dignified cool but as her movies get broader and more culturally problematic she gives me Whoopi Goldberg whiplash. Either way she seems to be the only woman in Hollywood brave enough to be funny even at the risk of clowning.A remake of the 1998 French movie by Luc ""The Fifth Element"" Besson ""Taxi"" requires Latifah to chauffeur cop Andy Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) around New York City at warp speeds to stop a series of crimes after he commandeers her cab. Fallons character is a terrible driver not to mention a terrible cop which means Latifah is like the Greyhound bus of both the car and the police work Most of the driving is left to her.The chief pleasure in ""Taxi"" aside from Latifahs mugging and nonstop complaining is a ludicrous plot involving a quartet of bank-robbing Brazilian models led by Gisele Bundchen. They tote guns and dress up in crazy disguises. (My favorite robbery get-up is their Russian hip-hopper look.) At some point Latifahs souped-up yellow cab is pitted against Bundchens crimson BMW and a twinge of inspiration rushes through the movie. Bundchen for her part is terrible in a bold and wonderful way. She has one great line delivery (""Gimme da cash No more games"") and a pit-stop scene with her partners that feels like an outtake from ""Zoolander.""The movie is only sporadically up to something. Its nice to see a Hollywood picture carried by a black woman who isnt Halle Berry especially one in which that woman chases down half-naked Glamazons. But too much of ""Taxi"" is just tired particularly where Fallon is concerned. The dynamic between him and Latifah requires her to be smarter than he is which based solely on their time together seems really easy. He does a lot of desperate pratfalls and dorky slapstick thats painfully unfunny so much so that when Latifah tells him ""You try too hard"" you want to say ""Amen.""Still this is a movie that does inspire the occasional backhanded compliment. Fallon is least annoying when trying to nail the falsetto in Natalie Coles ""This Will Be"" and all those car chases and ensuing pileups dont seem as much like a video game as they could. (Never mind that a few of those chases begin in midtown Manhattan and climax inexplicably on the streets of Los Angeles.) Tim Story (""Barbershop"") directs with such apparent indifference to rhythm geography and sensible staging that theres reason to think Latifahs character isnt the only one with a hack license.If reading this makes you want to run out and find the version Besson wrote however be aware its just as dumb in French.
