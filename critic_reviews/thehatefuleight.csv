Entertainment ""The Hateful Eight"" Is The Meanest Movie Quentin Tarantinos Ever Made The Western goes where Tarantinos last two movies didnt -- into unapologetic sadism. Warning This piece contains spoilers Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue in The Hateful Eight. The Weinstein Company ID 7761865 The Hateful Eight is the meanest movie Quentin Tarantino has ever made.There are probably more elegant ways to put it but that feels most accurate. Its been lingering with me like a stomachache since I watched it a few weeks ago now that sensation of having gorged on something irresistible and terrible that you know is going to make you sick. Its about the thrill of watching people destroy one another its eponymous eight (plus one surprise guest) working their way up to attempting to kill each other in the snowbound confines of Minnies Haberdashery with great enthusiasm and no small amount of success all for the audiences entertainment. Its a film that starts with a pair of characters chuckling about belting a woman repeatedly in the face -- you know old-timey fun -- and ends with a pair of characters bleeding out together the deep-seated enmity between them temporarily overcome by their enjoyment of getting to watch that same lady be hanged.Tarantino didnt get the Best Original Screenplay Oscar nomination for The Hateful Eight that many were predicting an award his last two movies -- Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds -- were up for (Django went on to nab him the win). The Hateful Eight didnt get Tarantino a Best Director or Best Picture nomination either. Both Django Unchained and Inglourious Basterds climbed to more than 100 million at the box office but The Hateful Eight is fighting to get to 50 million. Patrick J. Lynch the man behind the police boycott of the film that was prompted by Tarantinos comments in support of Black Lives Matter has claimed responsibility for the lower ticket sales. Anythings possible but what seems more likely is that people are staying away from The Hateful Eight because its such an uncomfortable film to contend with on many levels from its length to its nastiness to its total moral queasiness. View this image > Samuel L. Jackson in The Hateful Eight. The Weinstein Company ID 7780680 Tarantinos mean streak hasnt changed over his years as a filmmaker but hes managed to acquire a new level of respectability by sheltering it inside borrowed historical atrocities. Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained couched their nastiness in fantasies of revenge against the giant systemic horrors of the Holocaust and American slavery. They were summarized by scenes of vivid shock -- Shosannas family being slaughtered under farmhouse floorboards the men at Candyland torn apart by dogs or forced to fight to the death -- that lent a righteous context to all the equally bloody retaliation that followed. Those forehead carvings and kneecappings could be safely enjoyed because they were positioned as earned on behalf of the forces of good against villains who could never be given enough punishment.Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained were at least as sadistic as anything else Tarantino has ever made but they were safer reconfiguring all of the directors well-known cinematic kinks into a frame of reference intended to make them go down easier. And theres something sourly disingenuous about the retribution to which they lay claim because its there to justify the bloodshed instead of the other way around. Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained blunted Tarantinos most provocative most unsettling and yes most interesting quality as a filmmaker -- the unapologetic democratic pleasure he takes in violence whether its being visited on characters we think might deserve it or on ones we like. ID 7779762 Tarantino has always made mean movies -- virtuosic movies bold outrageous ones that are overstuffed and rife with references; movies that are sometimes brilliant and increasingly indulgent but all of them with an unmistakable mean streak under the crackling conversation and the dark humor. Its not just the violence though thats obviously part of it -- its the way he treats that violence with equal potential for spectacle no matter who its being directed at. Death can come for any character in his movies and often does. Consider Vincent Vega (John Travolta) shot to death coming out of the crapper in Pulp Fiction. Hes a character we watched on the job as a hitman on a complicated date with the bosss wife and doing some gruesome automotive cleaning -- someone we invested in turned in that scene into an quick bloody punchline. View this image > Walton Goggins in The Hateful Eight. The Weinstein Company ID 7780688 The movies jumbled timeline softens the blow of Vincents death by allowing him to be back for the finish but Tarantino hasnt always bothered to provide cushioning for his habit of creating big colorful characters and killing them off -- spitefully and zestfully. Christoph Waltzs Dr. King Schultz dies abruptly and impulsively in Django Unchained. Most of the Inglourious Basterds characters get killed -- as do for more orderly reasons most of the ones in Kill Bill. A whole set of women are introduced established and then brutally murdered off in Death Proof and theyre replaced by a new tougher set poised to retaliate against Kurt Russells Stuntman Mike and his specially rigged car. Death Proof treats the lap dance that Vanessa Ferlitos character gives Mike with the same sensuality it treats the tire that grinds across her face -- its all just more to watch.People used to criticize Tarantinos movies for their violence though no one so in love with dialogue and savoring the ramp up to action could ever be the gorehound poster boy. Though Tarantino has gotten visibly exasperated about his place as the unwilling spokesperson for movie carnage in a 2010 speech to the British Academy of Film and Television he said ""Thats why Thomas Edison created the motion picture camera -- because violence is so good. It affects audiences in a big way. You know youre watching a movie.""That last part I think is key. When Reservoir Dogs (1992) first played for crowds the scene when Michael Madsen went from gyrating silkily to Stealers Wheel to slicing off Kirk Baltzs ear was enough to make some people up and flee which seems almost quaint 24 years later. The camera demurely swings away when Madsens Mr. Blonde goes to work. Theres no close-up of a straight razor methodically sawing through cartilage to sear itself into your brain -- by todays standards its downright restrained. If theres queasiness it comes not from how graphic the sequence is but from the way it aligns everyone watching the movie with a psychopath getting himself warmed up for a little casual torture. View this image > Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs. The Weinstein Company ID 7780690 That whole scene is built around Mr. Blondes anticipation of inflicting pain not the seemingly doomed possibility that the cop might escape or that wed ever expect him to. Its suspense is all about how bad its going to get. Mr. Blonde is the one were invested in -- charismatic and vicious looming large in the frame like a performer on stage his audience tied to a chair but also out in the dark of the theater. He doesnt have any end goal in mind -- hes given up on trying to extract information. Hes just enjoying himself and so is Tarantino. And so are we. Because why else are the rest of us sticking around? ID 7780043 The Hateful Eight is set in the past like Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained but it feels just as close in spirit to Reservoir Dogs -- about a group of justifiably suspicious people holed up together in one space trying to figure out whos going to betray who. Its era is there to explain how these people ended up so fractured and hard the Civil War a mire of ugliness and death from which theyre trying to emerge -- or maybe not since these are the people whove made their way to the Wild West where trusting no one and being quick with a gun can still be best practice. There are no good guys in The Hateful Eight just a set of apparent innocents we see offed in a flashback. The closest we otherwise get maybe is Samuel L. Jacksons bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren and hes not good hes just been the most wronged.Fellow bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) makes a practice of malice -- rather than tote corpses around like Warren he takes his captives in because he likes to see them hanged not because hes reluctant to shoot them himself. Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is introduced chained up and assaulted but shes a ferocious convict herself and while Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) may be the future sheriff hes also a racist and a former Lost Causer. And Bob (Demian Bichir) Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) and Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) are all harboring secret agendas. Meanwhile Jody (Channing Tatum) is down in the basement ready to blast Warrens balls off. View this image > Russell Leigh and Bruce Dern in The Hateful Eight. The Weinstein Company ID 7780693 The conflicts these characters have are fueled by years of war and animus but theyre also personal based on spite and contempt and the desire to hurt another person. Theres a mean-spiritedness that goes to the bone here all in ""GLORIOUS 70mm SUPERSCOPE"" from that snowy opening shot in which were dropped into the stagecoach with John and Daisy and squirmingly left to figure out whether were going to laugh when John decks her and whether were supposed to. I dont think that Tarantino is entirely clear or is even interested in being that precise which is part of whats so agitating about the whole movie -- is it about misogyny or is it misogynistic? Is it about racism is it racist or does it fall somewhere in between?Take for instance the use of the n-word one Tarantino has a well-established and oft-criticized fondness for. But theres a particular snap to its use in this movie when the characters mean it as unambiguously hateful. And then theres the story that Warren tells to former Confederate General Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern) to goad him into drawing his gun a story that may or may not be true but that we see on screen revenge for the attempt on Warrens life as well as for Smithers having executed captured black Union soldiers rather than sending them to the camps like white ones. Its a scene that reads like a ""come at me"" aimed at bell hooks. Its so fraught and loaded with Warren making Smithers son crawl through the snow to suck on his ""big black pecker"" before killing him. The tale finds Warren playing on all of Smithers worst fears but its also a goad for the audience who are left to react to this scene of cartoonishly racialized sexual violence one that realizes the old mans bigotry and homophobia but thats also visualized with unfiltered gusto Jackson laughing above that bobbing head. ID 7780642 The Hateful Eight is sadistic in all the lip-licking satisfaction it takes in every gunshot poisoning and strangulation it offers up no matter who it happens to but its intriguingly nasty to the audience too. It presents the potential to feel sympathy toward or see the humanity in a particular character to lean toward him or her for a moment and then it yanks the possibility away as foolish -- most strikingly in the moment when Jody reveals himself as having come to the rescue of his sister a lone flicker of sweetness interrupted by Warren shooting him in the head. At that point in the movie the snicker it prompts is less complicated. He was a bad guy anyway but then again they are all pretty much. View this image > Jackson in The Hateful Eight. The Weinstein Company ID 7780694 Thats why its so enjoyable and so revolting to watch these nine awful people fight and fall apart as they try to survive the storm when it doesnt matter if any of them get out alive. If theres any moral or larger meaning to The Hateful Eight its the depressing conviction that facing oppression hasnt made any of its characters more likely to have sympathy for the oppressed -- its just made them hard. Mean. And we flow between them nothing to root for except more violence all of it carefully composed and timed.We have as an audience become accustomed to watching violence thats either outlandishly cartoonish -- like the bloodless building-wrecking battles at the end of most blockbusters now that feel totally meaningless -- or violence thats somberly graphic -- like when the remnants of a dead soldiers face are splayed on the controls of the tank in 2014s Fury and were meant to reflect on the Terribleness of War. Tarantino chooses neither of these options. Instead he opts for visceral and gleeful gruesome and exuberant violence as a source of pleasure as unabashed and valid as the music on his soundtracks the faces and bodies of the actors he casts and his distinctive dialogue. He makes you feel it. Its a deeply conflicting version of fun.

"Review The Hateful Eight serves up a meaty plot bathed in blood - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview The Hateful Eight serves up a meaty plot bathed in bloodBy Tony Hicksthicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 12/24/2015 115113 AM PSTUpdated 12/30/2015 043413 PM PST This image released by The Weinstein Company shows Kurt Russell from left Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bruce Dern in a scene from the film ""The Hateful Eight."" (Andrew Cooper/The Weinstein Company via AP) ( Andrew Cooper ) Quentin Tarantinos ""The Hateful Eight"" is a lot of things. Boring of course isnt one of them. Long? Yes. Skillfully made and at times beautiful? Yes. Fun? Absolutely. Great story development with the necessary twist(s)? Oh yes. Shocking? Yes. A satisfying conclusion? Lets just say its a Tarantino-ish ending.Violent and bloody? Very much.Too violent and bloody? Probably.Tarantinos trademark insistence on not just showing an audience what extreme violence looks and sounds like but going above and beyond that for shock value is almost too much in this case. Not because its offensive to the sensibilities (its Tarantino and we expect it) but because its distracting.The operative word here is ""almost"" (unlike ""Django Unchained"" which went from being a fine movie to one tarnished by a bloodbath that was almost comical). ""The Hateful Eight"" gets close to ""Djangos"" bloody tipping point but is rescued by the fact that in premise and execution this may be Tarantinos best film since ""Kill Bill.""We are talking here about a movie packed with effective suspense action cinematography and dialogue that does throw 50 or 60 too many N-bombs even for an 1870s setting sizzling with post-Civil War resentment. John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) is a bounty hunter crossing Wyoming with unhinged prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) during a blizzard. Along the way they pick up stragglers -- Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) both notably connected to the Civil War on opposite sides. Advertisement On their way to Red Rock -- where Domergue will likely hang and Mannix is supposed to become the new sheriff -- the four seek shelter at the mountaintop stagecoach stopover Minnies Haberdashery.Inside are four mysterious men in whats essentially a decent-sized one-room lodge. Bob (Demian Bichir) is the stable hand who claims proprietors Minnie (Dana Gourrier) and Sweet Dave (Gene Jones) left him in charge while they went to visit someone on the other side of the mountain. Tim Roth plays Oswaldo Mobray a polite Englishman who nevertheless claims to be on his way to become the hangman of Red Rock. Michael Madsen is the quiet and seemingly affable Joe Cage a cattleman headed to visit his mother. Bruce Dern plays the tightly wound General Sandy Smithers a former Confederate leader who has ties to Warren an infamous and vicious Union fighter who once had a Confederate price on his head.At first glance a 2-hour-and-47-minute movie seems a bit much (theres an intermission) but the length allows Tarantino to let tempers build to a boil and subplots unfold while the continuous background buzz of the blizzard is just irritating enough to make matters worse. He also indulges in some of his famous time-juggling revealing how everyone came to Minnies and including a shocking flashback that connects Jacksons character to the son of another of Minnies occupants.Many of the actors are Tarantino regulars with traits weve seen before (Jackson as usual is alternately incredibly fun to watch and downright frightening). But its newcomer Jason Leigh who is the scene-stealer with her brooding-to-shrieking-rage range of emotions. Shes wonderfully over the top as is Russell to a lesser degree as the loud angry morally ambivalent bounty hunter who likes to watch his victims swing. (At least twice he slips into a serious John Wayne imitation whether he knows it or not.)Despite the gore (one scene approaches ""Monty Python"" ridiculousness) this film is nevertheless nuanced. Theres a trace of Agatha Christie in how the movie puts the filmgoers brain to work trying to figure out who these people really are what is truth and what are lies and how theyre all connected. Not just whos on which side but how many sides are there? And when will it come to a head?That makes ""The Hateful Eight"" one of Tarantinos meatiest films even if he did pour an entire bottle of sensationalist steak sauce over the top.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.The hateful Eight    1/2Rating R (for strong bloody violence a scene of violent sexual content language and some graphic nudity)Cast Kurt Russell Samuel L.

Jackson Michael Madsen and Tim Roth as well as newcomers like Jennifer Jason Leigh. By Peter Rainer Film critic December 24 2015 Save for later Saved The Hateful Eight stars Samuel L. Jackson. Andrew Cooper/The Weinstein Company/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Quentin Tarantinos ""The Hateful Eight"" opens with a six horse-drawn stagecoach galloping through a Wyoming snowscape. The film was shot in 70mm Ultra Panavision and so the vistas are vast. The same cannot be said for the drama occuring inside those vistas.To be accurate the main action is preceded by an overture - remember those? Tarantino is nothing if not old school. (There hasnt been a movie shot with these Ultra Panavision lenses since ""Khartoum"" in 1966.) The music is by Ennio Morricone who did the score for Tarantinos favorite movie Sergio Leones ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly."" ""The Hateful Eight"" dispenses with the Good and goes with the Bad and the Ugly. Whats surprising about the film is that after a suitable interval in the great oudoors the remainder of its three-hour running time takes place indoors inside a large stagecoach stop which is en route to a town where the various players in the piece are converging. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Aboard the stagecoach is John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) a bounty hunter with a walrus moustache who is transporting his shackled prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh complete with mossy teeth) to collect his big reward and see her hang. Joining the fray is Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) a former Union soldier and also a bounty hunter and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) a former Rebel soldier who claims hes the new sheriff in town. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Inside the stagecoach stop which is large enough to house a battalion are a few more suspicious varmints including Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) a Britisher with a bowler hat who claims to be a hangman; Bob (Demian Bichir) who is playing a stereotypical Mexican; Joe (Michael Madsen) a surly cowboy not fond of eye contact; and General Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern) a former Rebel officer and an arrant racist. Its a heady stew except Tarantino overvalues their appeal. Its clear that things are not what they seem and as usual in his films we wait for the score-settling violence to erupt. It takes an awfully long time for that to happen and when it does its so garishly over-the-top that the movie becomes a kind of killing comedy. Except I didnt hear myself laughing. Tarantino writes crackerjack dialogue with his signature stamp on every line; he has on occasion a crackerjack film sense too. But this attenuated Western whodunit is overscaled and underfelt; the slam-bang mayhem happens for no other reason except that Tarantino has few other emotional (or filmic) resources to fall back on. Hes filmdoms reigning arrested adolescent. Except for ""Jackie Brown"" his least-recognized movie and probably his best his eight-film career is a euphoria of homages to the mostly pulpy flicks he favors.Actors love working for him because he provides roles you can - literally - sink your teeth into. Its fun for a while to see Kurt Russell hamming it up behind his voluminous mustache or Samuel L. Jackson once again raising rafters by laying down the law. But the film is pointless even as entertainment because it builds to nothing more than a comic book blood bath. You cant accuse Tarantino of playing out his second childhood because its not clear if hes ever left his first.

Big ScreenMovie Reviews The odious 8.25 1 1 Tarantino goes West(ern) By Scott Marks Dec. 30 2015 Facebook Twitter Google+ Share Email Story alerts Letter to Editor Pin it The Hateful Eight  Quentin Tarantinos The Hateful Eight is being billed as the directors eighth film. It appears as though QT like most devoted cinephiles has forgotten about his segment in Four Rooms. The addition brings the tally up to 8.25 a number more in line with the Fellini homage he was clearly aiming for. The advance screenings were all presented on DCP and this old celluloid dreamer would have none of it. Tarantino resurrected the cinematic equivalent of antique farm equipment to make this movie and damned if I wasnt going to see it as he intended in Ultra Panavision 70. Patience a word normally missing from my vocabulary paid off. Had I succumbed to a digital screening theres no way a return viewing would have been in the immediate future not even if QT shot it in horizontal VistaVision and Smell-O-Rama. (On a technical note John Sittig and his crew at Reading Grossmont honored Tarantinos wishes down to the letter. That meant frame-hugging masking and uniform focus of the giant 60-foot image. [Alas no cue marks.] With the image shorn of pixels one could count the dusted-over snowflakes that covered the tops of hats. And the coffee steam that curled from under the brim couldnt have felt more immersive had it been shot in 3D.) Samuel L. Jackson leads the odious octet calling on his Superman-ish skills to press every line of his African bounty hunters dialog into glistening diamonds. The icy locale and sole location recall Kurt Russells work in The Thing but its another John Carpenter creation Snake Plissken and his Duke Wayne drawl that the actor winkingly calls attention to. QT stalwart Tim Roth returns to play the hangman Oswaldo Mobray a reference to character actor Alan Mowbray whose Shakespearean recital in My Darling Clementine never fails to elicit applause. Its Jennifer Jason Leigh the sole hateful female of the group whose scattered moments of underplaying effectively steal the show but more on the treatment of her character later. Clocking in at a whopping 168 minutes (plus a 12-minute pee-break) it could easily have lost an hour starting with an unyieldingly juvenile scene involving Craig Stark and no one would have been any the wiser. What was it about this cramped underdeveloped parlor drama -- the majority of which takes place on one set -- that caused Tarantino to think 70mm? The frigid snowscapes that open the film put the lens to the test but the moment one stage replaces the other all of the verbal anachronisms in Tarantinos loopy lexicography cant buoy it. The wide-gauge format isnt the only ghost of cinema past that QT resuscitates and still the iceman never comeths. The third-act flashback reversal that served him well in Pulp Fiction forcing even the most casual filmgoer to ponder narrative structure reads like feeble inner-dialogue in these parts. Without the benefit of surprise -- bottomless splatter and the directors post-intermission narration dont count -- QTs restaging of the Civil War in a Wyoming bar owes more to Agatha Christie than it does John Fords Stagecoach. By way of compensation his dialog is spiked with more easygoing epithets than youd find at a Santee smoker the majority of which are etymologically unsound and included simply to shock and elicit laughter from his minions. (You just know that in his heart he wanted to go full-Christie by calling it 8 Little N-Words.) The packed crowd that joined me for a Sunday morning matinee reserved their biggest laughs for the two moments that showcase the directors fetishistic preoccupation with Leighs abasement. The first comes in response to one of many cartoonish (her black eye appears to have been applied by the same makeup artist who touched up Grouchos mustache) but nonetheless gratuitous blows to the face she endures the other when the raisin-toothed wreck finds herself on the receiving end of a shower of bloody vomit. Why Ultra Panavision 70? My guess is that a young Tarantino had a poster from a feature shot in that arcane process tacked to his bedroom wall and logo-whore that he is vowed to one day shoot a film in the pristine band-aid format. See it at Grossmont or not at all the second option being your best bet.

Yeah maybe an hour cut - but that would take care of all those exteriors so yeah youre right why 70mm? QT always leaves me conflicted on one half theres the slathering self-love for his own highly expository dialogue...then theres the cinephile/video store clerk who always has his ducks in a row for lots of homages and nearly forgotten B-movie references and getting some actors (AB and C) fun work. He had me at the brochure and Morricone score and the actors always bring their best scene chewing. All of his stuff is meta and youre always outside his movies with a delicious grin (if youre over 40) so for a popcorn movie Ill take this over the rest of the CGI plastic industry. 1 1 Add photo Post reply Sign in to reply Sign in to suggest removal Sign in to comment Username I have an account.

Its the perfect moment to get up stretch your legs and perhaps chat with a nearby friend as I did. Because the first half of The Hateful Eight begs a question that the second half doesnt really answer namely Whats the point of all of this?Related Story The Amorality of Django Unchained Quentin Tarantino has long revered the epic trappings of the cinema-going experience more than most directors and for all of its flaws the experience of seeing The Hateful Eight in 70mm is a genuinely thrilling throwback to an era when a night at the pictures was intended as a real event. But for this wide-screen event hes chosen an uncompromisingly nasty brutish story even by his standards a bloody tale of America reckoning with itself that takes place almost entirely in a large room in post-Civil War Wyoming while a blizzard rages outside. At moments it feels like Tarantino is really trying to say something about the bizarre angry jigsaw of people who help make this country the polarized mess it remains today but once the film shifts into an expected cacophony of violence whatever that might be slips through his gore-stained fingers.The Hateful Eight is part Western part drawing-room mystery part exploitation film but shot with the most gorgeous lenses imaginable and scored with an epic sweep by Ennio Morricone. The main characters such as they are are the bounty hunter Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) a legendary Union soldier who expertly wields two pistols; John Ruth (Kurt Russell) another bounty hunter looking to claim the price on the head of the brutish criminal Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh); and the Southern renegade Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) an avowed racist who claims hes the new sheriff of the town Warren and Ruth are headed toward. A blizzard drives them to take shelter in a nearby haberdashery where they meet an assortment of odd characters already hunkering down and from there the action very slowly unfolds.Tarantino has long been a self-indulgent filmmaker but in a way that plays to his unique strengths spinning gold from long tangential exchanges of dialogue or curious flashbacks that eventually snap into his films main plotlines with a satisfying click. The Hateful Eight never quite finds the delightful rhythm that makes Tarantinos shaggy masterpieces Jackie Brown and Inglourious Basterds so lovable despite their many digressions. Most of the films eight major characters get a ploddy introduction with 15 minutes of windy expositional dialogue devoted to their convoluted backstories so that audiences know exactly where everyone stands (or at least purports to stand) when the climax arrives. Warren escaped a Confederate prison under mysterious circumstances; Mannix rode with a scary-sounding band of Southern renegades committing atrocities; many more such yarns are exhaustively recounted and the only real tension comes from trying to guess at whats true and what isnt.His actors mostly dig into their roles with real relish. Goggins is right now the screens greatest slack-jawed Southerner whether hes playing a buffoon (as in Spielbergs Lincoln) or a wily mastermind (TVs Justified). Here hes a fascinating mix of both never quite tipping his hand either way. Jackson too finally gets a showcase role again from Tarantino--his first since he was the slimy villainous lead of Jackie Brown--and shows just what an electrifying actor he can be given a weighty role. Warren is handed the films worst moment an absurdly long monologue about the violation and murder of an offscreen character and just about manages to sell it even though it indulges all of Tarantinos worst impulses to shock his audience with embarrassingly gross content.Leigh clearly relishes her characters villainy almost as much as the film takes pleasure in raking her over the coals subjecting her to constant verbal abuse beatings and much worse (Ill steer clear of specifics to avoid spoiling the films incredibly demented conclusion). But for all the exposition and flashback The Hateful Eight struggles to explain exactly what makes Domergue so evil and why shes the focal point the films plot eventually begins to revolve around as characters like the hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) the grunting Mexican caretaker Bob (Demian Bechir) and the soft-spoken cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) sniff around on the sidelines. After a lot of setup Tarantino does set the gears of his overarching story in motion and the films conclusion is undeniably arresting and maybe the most shockingly violent work of his career. But the point remains elusive.As Warren Ruth Mannix and Domergue arrive at Minnies Haberdashery one of the men they meet is a retired Confederate General played with grumpy relish by Bruce Dern. Of all the films characters he immediately poses the least threat but his bloody legacy in the Civil War is much discussed unsurprisingly reviled by Warren and revered by Mannix. That toxic atmosphere pervades the film and as seeming enemies are forced to strike uneasy alliances later in the film it feels like Tarantino is trying to talk about the bizarre patchwork that makes up modern American society and the dark history underpinning its modern conflict. It doesnt work. The Hateful Eight is too extreme too ghoulishly violent too besieged by its ensembles overriding villainy to feel like anything but a dark chamber piece. Its ultimate pitch is this If you lock a bunch of angry wounded and evil creatures in a room theyll tear each other apart. The only mystery is to how its going to happen and thats not enough to justify this three-hour symphony of flowery dialogue and explosive gore.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

By Anthony Lane Quentin Tarantino directs Kurt Russell Jennifer Jason Leigh and Samuel L. Jackson.   Credit Illustration by Zohar Lazar Combine two films released on Christmas Day Quentin Tarantinos ""The Hateful Eight"" and Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus ""The Revenant"" and what have you got? Five hours and thirty-eight minutes of malice and mistrust in which the characters--mostly men--are trapped in extreme weather conditions and settle their differences with extreme violence. So much for peace and good will. If I said that my thoughts during those long and bloody hours didnt stray now and then to Bing Crosby Id be lying. ""The Hateful Eight"" takes place in postbellum Wyoming. The film is of epic duration and like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" includes an intermission yet its settings could not be more cramped. Much of the first half is spent in a stagecoach and the rest--barring brief trips to a stable and an outhouse plus a few flashbacks--is spent in Minnies Haberdashery a lonely hangout which also serves coffee and stew. As for Wyoming we see it in fits and starts icy plains and peaks whose purpose is less to dazzle us than to wall in the dramatis personae. At selected theatres the movie will be screened in 70 mm. which sounds grandiose but as with Paul Thomas Andersons ""The Master"" in the same format what absorbs the director is the ever-changing landscape of the human face. Nothing was as daunting in Andersons film as his closeups of Amy Adams and Tarantino grants an equal honor to Jennifer Jason Leigh. She plays an outlaw Daisy Domergue and one slow look that she gives raising her face with a black eye and a crinkled grin to fill the screen may be the most convincing portrait of wickedness--and of its demonic appeal--in all of Tarantino. With that smile alone Leigh possesses the film. To say that Daisy is going to meet her doom is not quite right because her doom is travelling beside her in the person of John Ruth (Kurt Russell) a bounty hunter. He is bringing her to be hanged in the town of Red Rock where he will collect a handsome reward. En route they pick up a couple of wayfarers--Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who is in the same trade as Ruth and Mannix (Walton Goggins) who says ""Ill be double dog damned"" and who will soon be assuming the post of Red Rocks sheriff  The coach arrives at Minnies where the rest of the lineup is assembled a Mexican named Bob (Demian Bichir) an old Confederate general (Bruce Dern) a near-wordless hulk (Michael Madsen) and a fussy little Brit who introduces himself as Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth). They are said to be random strangers but we have our doubts. From the start of the film theres a creepy--not to say ridiculous--sense of everybody wherever they hail from being cuffed and tied by circumstance. ""Considerin theres a blizzard goin on theres a whole lot of fellows wanderin around"" Ruth says on sighting Mannix. The line gets a laugh but its a ruse Tarantino is palming off the convolutions of his plot as a knowing gag. Not content with mustering his suspects as if they were the snowbound passengers in ""Murder on the Orient Express"" he needs to be sure that we appreciate his cunning--even addressing us in voice-over after the intermission and showing us a clue we may have missed. What a wag. The movie billed in the opening credits as ""The 8th Film by Quentin Tarantino"" is a beastly brew a blend of Agatha Christie and Sergio Leone spiked with postmodernist poison. We get an Ennio Morricone score--sadly no match for ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" where his musical glories washed in sadness against Leones array of sombre deeds. We get a lot of talk about Civil War treachery and payback; as in ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"" history is something to be toyed with not explored--a chance for boyish fantasies of revenge as if enormous crimes could be undone after the event by lone and wanton acts of humiliation. We get plenty of ripe performances with Jackson and Russell enjoying a tight battle of whiskers and pipe smoke. Above all we get confirmation of the directors preeminent perversity patient and elaborate in his racking up of tension he knows only one way to resolve it and that is through carnage displayed in unmerciful detail. To be fair the more blood is spilled the more some people lap it up; the audience at my screening howled with glee as Daisys face was showered with the contents of someone elses head. Chacun a son gout. By the end of ""The Hateful Eight"" its status as a tale of mystery and its deference to classic Westerns have all but disappeared worn down by the grind of its sadistic vision. That is the Tarantino deal by blowing out folks brains he wants to blow our minds. There you are somewhere near the Missouri River on a freezing day. Youve got no place to stay so what do you do? You check into a horse. If youre Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) the hero of ""The Revenant"" that is your preferred method and its hard to quarrel with though it cant be much fun for the horse. You slit open the belly tug out the guts strip naked crawl inside read a little light fiction for a while and nod off. The basics of life--clothing and food as well as accommodation--are much to the fore in ""The Revenant"" which is set in the eighteen-twenties. Glasss principal outfit is a shaggy animal pelt that he wears as a poncho. For nourishment he sucks marrow from the skeleton of something horned; catches a writhing fish and tears the flesh off with his teeth (all in a single shot); and chows down on a nameless hunk of bison also uncooked. You can experience that type of cuisine nowadays but only if you order the foraging menu at a restaurant in Copenhagen whereas Glass is dining for free on the borders of civilization. Not that Inarritus movie has much faith in the civilized. Glass belongs to a motley band of hunters and fur trappers ravaging the land and its fauna for profit. They number forty or so in a rough hierarchy with Captain Henry (Domhnall Gleeson) just about keeping charge. Also present are a cussed crook named Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy); Bridger (Will Poulter) whos barely more than a kid; and another youngster Hawk (Forrest Goodluck) who is Glasss son by a Native American woman. The whole plot is impelled by Glasss paternal loyalty to Hawk but that is thinly sketched and I never quite believed in them as father and child. The first twenty minutes are the best. As we contemplate the hides stretched out to dry or baled up for shipping downriver the hunters are suddenly ambushed on every flank by Arikara who resent the rape of their country. When one of them on horseback rides into the frame we stay with him galloping onward until he is felled whereupon we switch our attention--our sensory allegiance as it were--to the man who brought him low. Then he is downed too and the camera is trained on his aggressor; and so forth in a roundelay of horror that feels as if it could go on forever. Thanks to that fluency the scene becomes a savage sequel to Inarritus ""Birdman"" which also ducked and darted from one figure to the next. The survivors of the fray take to the river in a graceless boat that resembles a log cabin and then continue their trek to the fur traders camp on foot. Glass out on a morning foray falls afoul of a bear who is protecting her cubs an astounding sequence not just because her claw swipes are so murderously fierce but because the ferocity rises and fades--she stops mauling sniffs him licks his face ambles off and then just when you think the onslaught is over comes back and swipes anew. Once it is over at last Glass is in shreds strung between life and death. Henry decides to carry on without him leaving him in the care of Bridger Fitzgerald and Hawk. That arrangement falters and soon it is Glass alone who must like a tattered Odysseus make his way home. The hitch with tales of endurance onscreen is their unfortunate habit of becoming endurance tests for the viewer and after a while ""The Revenant"" turns into a slog. Make no mistake its a very beautiful slog. Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography summons a wealth of wonders and there is one image of a Pawnee warrior arcing his bow beside a fire in a whirring squall of snow that I will not forget. But some of the beauty has a willful air and seldom do we feel that the moments of transcendence have been happened upon as we do with a film like Werner Herzogs ""Aguirre the Wrath of God."" What Inarritu has created is less an adventure than a solemn pilgrimage suppressing the giddy flights of ""Birdman"" and as for DiCaprio his forte--a comic impishness last released in ""The Wolf of Wall Street""--is sternly curbed. Awed reports of what he went through on the set of ""The Revenant"" cannot disguise the fact that his character is a moral monotone who suffers great afflictions but no change. Although the wild world is thrown at him how much really stirs in the heart of Glass?  An earlier version of this article misstated Mannixs future post.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Dec. 24 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Wednesday Dec. 23 2015 238PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Quentin Tarantino Written by Quentin Tarantino Starring Samuel L. Jackson Kurt Russell Jennifer Jason Leigh Walton Goggins Classification 18A Genre drama Year 2015 Country USA Language English Cheekily the director of The Hateful Eight labels his latest work ""The 8th film by Quentin Tarantino."" It is to be considered then as part of an oeuvre and indeed it can be read as a sequel of sorts to Django Unchained and the third in a trilogy of period films that began with Inglourious Basterds. Again Tarantino plays the hypothetical historian Basterds was a Holocaust revenge fantasy set in France in 1944; Django was an equally vengeful tale of a slaves liberation just before the American Civil War; now in the years following that war The Hateful Eight considers how Northern and Southern black man and white man might be reconciled. Like its predecessors The Hateful Eight is exceedingly well-crafted and exceptionally violent. It introduces four characters John Ruth (Kurt Russell) is a bounty hunter bringing in the murderess Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) - and bringing her in alive. Travelling toward the law by stagecoach across wintry Wyoming - gorgeously portrayed in vast vistas captured on 70-millimetre film - they meet Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) another bounty hunter who prefers to be paid for corpses. Ruth reluctantly gives him a lift and they are soon joined by the new sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who says he is heading to town to accept his badge.The plot a mystery of sorts gets rolling when they take shelter from a blizzard at a lodge where they find themselves stuck with four more characters a hangman a cow puncher a Mexican and a former Confederate general. (From this point on the much-touted 70-mm becomes rather superfluous.) The possible escape of the hard-bitten Daisy who Ruth keeps handcuffed to his wrist and punches viciously at the slightest provocation is the linchpin here but in truth the inclusion of one female character is largely tokenism. The men are surprised by her presence but her gender matters so little to the story that it can be argued the grotesque violence done to her makes no comment on the treatment of women but instead is merely part of the films larger picture of a viciously retributive society.Besides if she is the trigger for the plot the main thematic confrontation is acted out by Warren who is black and a former Union soldier on the one hand and the two nakedly racist characters Sheriff Mannix and the old Confederate general on the other. As they come under attack from some mysterious scheme swirling around them - not everyone here is who they seem in a plot with some flourishes worthy of Agatha Christie - they have to decide whether they can possibly band together.And so in the end Tarantino heals the wounds of the Civil War and unites American society - by means of a bloodbath that kills practically everybody in the room. The Hateful Eight asks us to consider a social union achieved through butchery just as Inglourious Basterds defeated Nazism with sadism and gore.Tarantino is a masterful storyteller painter of cinematic images and director of actors; the script the cinematography and the cast of outlandish characters created by a powerful ensemble dashingly led by Jackson cant be faulted in any way. The auteur again displays the playful narrative dexterity with which he first distinguished himself so amusingly in Pulp Fiction but this time he addresses that thematically too as both the characters and the audience question how much they can believe of the various tall tales that get told here.And the film is also yet again exceedingly violent; the complaints of those who detest Tarantino for that reason should be acknowledged. In that regard he is a director who has his cake and eats it too exciting an audience with blood even as he critiques that excitement.The Hateful Eight could be interpreted as another example of the embarrassingly presumptuous Tarantino playing God - a vengeful Old Testament one - fixing history by blowing up the bad guys. If that interpretation suggests itself it is only because of the sometimes cringe-making spectacle in Basterds and Django of Captain Quentin riding to the rescue of Jews and slaves on his celluloid steed.And yet Tarantinos craft is so superb it seems wiser to give him the benefit of the doubt; to figure that he knows precisely what he is doing when he depicts an America in which black and white have only one unifying belief the power of the gun. The Hateful Eight is not a movie about Americas past but about its present and the final picture it paints is very dark indeed. That Tarantino takes you on a wild and hugely entertaining ride before he makes that explicit is what some would consider his genius - and others might call downright amoral. The Hateful Eight is devilishly good. Report Typo/Error Follow Kate Taylor on Twitter thatkatetaylor More Related to this Story The familiar faces of Tarantino films from Samuel L.

Jackson plays Major Marquis Warren also a bounty hunter in the film.(Photo Andrew Cooper)Theres never been any doubt that writer-director Quentin Tarantino loves talk and violence. Which is why its no surprise that his latest film ""The Hateful Eight"" is filled with talk and violence.Unfortunately he has decided to separate the two in equally long sections. The first 90 minutes of the film is almost all talk much of it irritatingly repetitive. Then the films final section -- with a 10-minute intermission the movie clocks in at over three hours -- becomes a blood-spattered gunfest thats far too close to Tarantinos directorial debut ""Reservoir Dogs"" for comfort.""The Hateful Eight"" is a western but its about the most closed-in western youll ever see. Most of the first part takes place is a stage coach which contains a bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) whos taking a prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to a town to be hung. Along the way he encounters and gives a lift to another bounty hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) and the towns new sheriff (Walton Goggins).They talk and talk and talk sharing all their colorful stories occasionally trading insults and threats. But a blizzard is coming so eventually they take refuge at a familiar trading post where they find a cowboy (Michael Madsen) a hangman (Tim Roth) a retired general (Bruce Dern) and a Mexican caretaker (Demian Bichir).Since this is Tarantino pretty much nobody is who they say they are tensions rise foul deeds occur and heads get blown off. This is an impressive ensemble and Tarantino has a true gift for dialogue and story twists but in the end all that talent seems to have been spent on pretty empty notions.This is a film hes made before but he made it better the first time around.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongThe Hateful EightGRADE C+Rated R for strong bloody violence a scene of violent sexual content language and some graphic nudityRunning time 182 minutes 6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 19 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1YFdigZ MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/12/24/movie-review-tarantino-repeats-western-hateful-eight/77900824/,200,thehatefuleight8,thehatefuleight,detroitnews

Jackson plays Major Marquis Warren in The Hateful Eight. Andrew Cooper /Courtesy of The Weinstein Company Depending on your perspective Quentin Tarantinos career either comes full circle or spins its wheels with The Hateful Eight a three-hour Western pastiche that combines the single-setting theatricality of his first feature Reservoir Dogs with the explosive Civil War politics of his last Django Unchained. As cinemas reigning pastiche artist Tarantino mixes and matches an array of influences into a remarkably compatible whole with spaghetti western maestro Ennio Morricone scoring a snowbound chamber piece that evokes John Carpenters The Thing and Agatha Christies Ten Little Indians in equal measure. Everyone old is made new again which is true not only of the referential texture of The Hateful Eight but of the narrow dimensions of Tarantinos filmic universe which keeps finding new ways to refresh old themes. A natural follow-up to Django Unchained a racially charged revenge tale set two years before the Civil War The Hateful Eight surveys a collection of outlaws and neer-do-wells holed up in a Wyoming cabin in the years after the war where the same tensions are sublimated rather than dissipated. In fact the first 100 minutes or so--the length of an average feature--marinate in that tension with only brief occasional spasms of violence suggesting the uneasy peace thats settled over the country from the Reconstruction Era to the present. As with the warehouse in Reservoir Dogs where thieves convene with an informant in their midst the cabin runs hot with suspicion and dubious Clint Eastwood squints but Tarantino is content to let it linger for a while. This is America as he understands it and this isolated outpost is his Ship of Fools. Tarantino takes his sweet time ramping up careful to give each character enough room for a proper introduction. In what will amount to a rare exterior scene the action begins in a stagecoach where John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) a bounty hunter known for keeping his targets alive is escorting black-eyed fugitive Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the town of Red Rock to face execution. As a blizzard encroaches the pair make room for two more strangers Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) a former Union soldier and fellow bounty hunter whose tough reputation precedes him and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) a southerner who claimed to be Red Rocks incoming sheriff. When the quartet arrive for an extended stay at Minnies Haberdashery they encounter another group of men with questionable agendas including Red Rocks British hangman (Tim Roth) Minnies Mexican caretaker (Demian Bichir) a snarling black hat (Michael Madsen) and foul former general of the Confederacy (Bruce Dern). The allegiances among these men--and Daisy perhaps the linchpin of the whole drama--are unclear but Major Warrens race gives their simmering animosity a focus and he in turn works to leverage an ugly situation to his advantage. Eventually a trigger is squeezed and the exceedingly bloody reckoning begins in earnest. Photographed in Super Panavision 70mm--the ""roadshow"" version of which includes an overture an intermission and other such blasts from spectacles past--The Hateful Eight may seem like a willfully perverse candidate for the large format since the Rocky Mountain expanses can barely be glimpsed through the haberdashery window. It seems likely that timing as much as vision inspired Tarantino to commit to an old-fashioned cinematic experience--with his beloved celluloid fading 70mm is his way of raging against the dying of the Xenon light. But applied to such an intimate setting the richness and depth of 70mm serve to heighten the tension considerably as Tarantino keeps adding intrigue between various sets of characters. Samuel L. Jackson presides confidently over this Agatha Christie scenario but there are potential eruptions all over the frame. The Hateful Eight veers into dicey territory at times particularly with Leighs Domergue who absorbs the lions share of the physical and verbal abuse however skilled she is at snarling insults through bloody rictus grins. Add to that Tarantinos liberal deployment of racial epithets and extravagant violence--Greg Nicotero of The Walking Dead fame gets second billing for his effects--and the viewership for this one narrows to the self-selected. Yet Tarantino can still spin a great yarn (and yarn within yarns) and his cast makes a meal of the dialogue with favorites like Jackson and Roth returning to old form and newcomers getting a showcase particularly Goggins who excels at charismatic hicks and Leigh who converts violence into a form of knockabout comedy. The Hateful Eight is a big shambling audacious inversion of the Western held together by Tarantinos sincere conviction that beyond his high juvenilia American audiences might recognize their own fractious nation.

The Associated Press Jennifer Jason Leigh in a scene from the film ""The Hateful Eight."" (Andrew Cooper/The Weinstein Company via AP) The Associated Press This image released by The Weinstein Company shows Samuel L. Jackson in a scene from ""The Hateful Eight."" (Andrew Cooper/The Weinstein Company via AP) Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is an unwilling passenger in a stagecoach crossing a wintry landscape. Her lack of enthusiasm may be attributed to the fact that she has an appointment to be hanged. Her escort is bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) who apparently hasnt been informed that hitting a woman even if shes an outlaw is socially unacceptable. But shes tough enough to take it -- or refuses to give Ruth the satisfaction of thinking she cant.The stagecoach is delayed by one of Ruths old acquaintances Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) who is also a bounty hunter and in possession of a precious document -- a letter from Abraham Lincoln in appreciation of his service in the Union Army.Domergue is unimpressed with the letter and unhappy with the idea of sharing the stagecoach with a black man. But the ill will between her and Warren is but a prelude to the powder keg of tension waiting for the stagecoach when it arrives at Minnies Haberdashery where civilization comes to die. Also starring Demian Bichir Bruce Dern Walton Goggins Michael Madsen and Tim Roth ""The Hateful Eight"" is a cinema buffs dream -- and unlike anything else in theaters this season. But thats only to be expected from Quentin Tarantino one of the few directors with the clout to pursue his vision wherever it takes him. Working from a self-penned screenplay Tarantino has come up with one of the wordiest Westerns on record and even some of his most diehard fans may grimace at the films occasionally slow pace. But ""The Hateful Eight"" more than compensates through its intriguing characters ominous atmosphere and palpable suspense.The film premieres on Christmas Day in a 70 mm print with a musical overture and intermission. Thats Tarantinos way of kicking it old school -- no doubt in cowboy boots. Theatrical digital screenings begin on New Years Eve.

Kurt Russell Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bruce Dern in ""The Hateful Eight."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Im delighted to inform you that the return of ""Star Wars"" is not the only happy event of the holiday season. Pop a cork because Quentin Tarantino is also back with a special gift for film buffs. Once again he carries viewers beyond the commonplace the mainstream and the mundane to a world of twisted sequential plotting racially provocative dialogue and more fake blood than you could stream from a fire plug. Even better his new film lasts just over three hours in its opening-week 70-millimeter roadshow engagement (a bit shorter in the nationwide debut Dec. 31). Who could not be grateful for this spaghetti western by the plateful -- ""The Hateful Eight""? A snowbound criminal thriller this mystery unfolds in the mountains of Wyoming shortly after the Civil War. The deliciously unsettling new score by Ennio Morricone and the long take on the opening image (a mournful frozen statue of the crucifixion) show its not a particularly happy time or place. Its a tone that gets a wry restatement when we meet the films stars. Samuel L. Jackson rises into the screen as Maj. Marquis Warren a bounty hunter patiently sitting out the days blizzard on a davenport of three corpses the dead-or-alive trio hes shipping to Red Rock to collect their reward money. As fate would have it -- ""Hateful"" is quite fateful -- he meets the stagecoach transporting his acquaintance fellow bounty hunter John Ruth. Played in classic John Wayne style by Kurt Russell Ruth is heading in the same direction for the same reason delivering notorious fugitive Daisy Domergue (largely silent but peerlessly expressive Jennifer Jason Leigh) for her hanging and his payday. Is it sheerest accident that these two shrewd money-hungry hombres crossed paths or is a dastardly plot brewing from the start? Theyre barely back on their path when they encounter another hitchhiker Chris Mannix (slightly dim and supremely amusing Walton Goggins) who claims to be Red Rocks newly elected sheriff. Right from the title Tarantino prepares us for a posse of untrustworthy unlikable desperadoes and he delivers even more than one would expect. We press deeper into Alfred Hitchcock meets Sergio Leone territory as the snowstorm stops the travelers at a middle-of-nowhere inn where we meet an even larger crew of tricky characters. Tim Roth claims to be Red Rocks charming hangman Bruce Dern a Confederate general Michael Madsen a cowpoke who just wants to visit his momma and Demian Bichir a Mexican handyman unlikely named Bob. Each is deliciously eccentric and suspicious. Weinstein Co. Samuel L. Jackson is a corpse- collecting bounty hunter. As in all of Tarantinos films there is a lot of sitting at tables eating and talking most of which leads to fatal ends. The 100-minute first act dawdles along with deliberately unhurried power-shifting and mood-building ending with a hilariously obscene flashback. At that point the slow fuse sparks and sputters all the way to the bomb of Act II where a narrator and a late-arriving guest star deliver the goriest exhibit of bloodcurdling entrails this side of a stockyard. ""The Hateful Eight"" is outrageous extraordinary extreme filmmaking at its most confident. A thematic sequel to ""Django Unchained"" it repeats that historical fantasias collection of unrepentant racists revengeful schemes political incorrectness and murderous forms of law enforcement. Its Tarantino at a new theatrical plane of patient script writing (who else would include so many references to Abraham Lincoln?) and focused scene staging. In stunning mountain vistas and cleverly blocked interiors his regular cinematographer Robert Richardson works wonders often with subtle but thematically meaningful contrasts of black and white. Tarantino has been talking for a while about retiring to make novels and television after 10 feature films. This one his eighth makes me wish he would reconsider. He is one of the most shocking subtle and scandalous filmmakers alive. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Andrew Cooper / The Weinstein Company)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Dec. 24 2015The Hateful EightStarring Samuel L. Jackson Kurt Russell Jennifer Jason Leigh Walton Goggins Demian Bichir Tim Roth Michael Madsen and Bruce Dern. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Opens Dec. 25 at the Varsity. 187 minutes. 18AQuentin Tarantino was justifiably outraged when his script for The Hateful Eight leaked online while he was casting his eighth feature.No filmmaker deserves this betrayal. Having now seen the final result though its tempting to wish the online snoops had offered a few tips to make it more than just a Howard Hawks-meets-Agatha Christie western.Article Continued BelowThis just isnt the Tarantino of Pulp Fiction Reservoir Dogs or even Inglourious Basterds although any film that gives Samuel L. Jackson a chance to talk and glower at length is a film worth seeing.It lacks the snap crackle and pop of Tarantinos cultural riffs of old and his pen desperately needs new ink -- the repeated use of a hateful racial epithet is extreme even by QTs standards. Worst still is the violence although not so much the cartoonish blood spill youd expect from a snowbound room of seven ruthless men (Jackson Kurt Russell Tim Roth Damian Bichir Bruce Dern Michael Madsen Walton Goggins) and one tough woman (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Its the unconscionable beatings delivered to that woman Leighs bounty-hunter prisoner Daisy Domergue which frankly border on sadism.Tarantino may be owning up to the deficiencies of his tale by making such a big deal of its early ""road show"" presentation in Ultra Panavision 70 mm replete with overture intermission and a custom-made Sergio Leone score. The visuals are superb even though the camera rarely leaves that single Wyoming haberdashery of hostility.

The Weinstein CompanyQuentin Tarantinos take on the Western is the usual mix of carefully crafted dialogue and violence but he goes overboard too often. With Samuel L. Jackson Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh.""The Hateful Eight"" is Samuel L. Jacksons sixth collaboration with director Quentin Tarantino.(Photo The Weinstein Company)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3.5 stars out of 5Quentin Tarantino never holds back with violence but here its often mean-spiritedSamuel L. Jackson has the showiest role and makes the most of itEveryone needs an editor.Yes even Quentin Tarantino headmaster of the too-much-is-never-enough school of filmmaking. Turns out that sometimes it is.""The Hateful Eight"" has all of his signature moves Violence (and how) profanity (ditto) meticulously crafted dialogue expert idiosyncratic direction and an obvious love of movies. But Tarantino goes overboard with nearly all of these elements in a film that blows past the three-hour mark (and didnt need to).You know going into one of his movies that violence is a given -- he uses it to shock to make a point as one of his storytelling tools. But here at times its mean-spirited in a way that it hasnt been before. He seems to be using it just to use it almost as a dare.That doesnt mean I didnt enjoy the movie. I did with a few reservations. For people who love film his movies are nearly impossible not to enjoy. Those elements mentioned above? He doesnt just include them. He stuffs his movies full to bursting with them which is one reason they reward repeated viewings.AZCENTRALYear in Review 2015 Goodykoontzs top 10 moviesOnce might be enough for ""The Hateful Eight"" however.The film begins with bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) hauling Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) by stagecoach through a snowstorm to Red Rock where hell collect a reward and shell hang. Along the way they pick up Maj. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) a former Union officer in the Civil War who is also a bounty hunter. If theyre not enough they also pick up Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) a racist Confederate veteran who claims to be the new sheriff in Red Rock.With conditions worsening they stop at Millies Haberdashery an outpost Warren is familiar with. But Millie isnt there and neither is her husband. Its not deserted though. Theres Bob (Demian Bichir) a Mexican cowhand; Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) a cowboy; Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) an erudite British fellow (down to the bowler); and Gen. Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern) a retired Confederate general.Kurt Russell Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bruce Dern star in Quentin Tarantinos latest film ""The Hateful Eight."" (Photo The Weinstein Company)Smithers and Warren have a shared bit of history inspired by but not limited to the Civil War. This is not exactly a meeting of the diversity-and-tolerance committee. For most of the movie this group along with the unlucky stagecoach driver O.B. (James Parks) who continually draws the short straw when it comes to going out into the blizzard for something will be holed up inside Millies waiting out the storm while trying to manage ratcheting tensions. Those tensions exist to begin with but the cocky Warren takes it upon himself to fan the flames occasionally.Eventually well see Channing Tatum Zoe Bell and others but for the most part Tarantino has thrown this bunch into a confined space and given them lots and lots of words to use against each other. You can tell the actors love it. When was the last time Russell has had this much to do in a movie? Leigh whose character repeatedly gets punched in the face and has some teeth knocked out is delightful in spite of this or maybe in a twisted way because of it.AZCENTRALThe Hateful Eight (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsBut confined spaces can become claustrophobic -- if not for the actors then eventually for the audience. There is no way this movie which includes an overture and an intermission if you see the 70 mm Roadshow version needed to be this long. (Yes Tarantino shot in 70 mm film an odd choice since most of the movie takes place inside a room. But I cant know for sure; I didnt see it in 70 mm.) If the dialogue action and especially the gorgeous pictures were concentrated into a tighter movie instead of diluted over the course of a longer one it would have been all the more powerful and more entertaining to boot.Tarantino seems to have no shortage of creativity or inspiration. What he needs to find is someone who isnt afraid to occasionally say ""Cut.""Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Comments (15) click to enlarge The Hateful Eight (70mm) Video Rated R  187 minutes  2015 Django Unchained convinced me that Quentin Tarantino is out of ideas; this follow-up another western didnt persuade me otherwise but it takes a more thoughtful approach to his usual preoccupations (revenge mainly). In Wyoming presumably during the tail end of Reconstruction a blizzard strands a bounty hunter (Kurt Russell) and the outlaw hes transporting (Jennifer Jason Leigh) at a rest stop with a grisly cast of characters one or more of whom may be surreptitiously trying to break the outlaw free. This is Tarantinos bleakest and most violent film but its also his slowest a meditation on vengeance and justice in America and possibly in his own movies. Why he needs three hours to draw no apparent conclusion is unclear. With Samuel L. Jackson Walton Goggins Tim Roth Michael Madsen Bruce Dern and Channing Tatum.

The movie is a lot of gore over a lot of nothing. 354 Shares Share 327 Tweet 20 Share 5 Share Email Print Share Sam Jackson one of the hateful. Photo The Weinstein Company The unpleasant truth exposed by The Hateful Eight is that Quentin Tarantinos wit and craftsmanship -- his artistic soul -- are inextricable from his sadism. He has gone to elaborate lengths to make the movie look like a classic widescreen Western in 70mm with a thunderously lyrical overture by the great Ennio Morricone and an intermission but theres nothing widescreen about his story. It seems perversely crabbed nihilistic and shot through with cruelty for crueltys sake. I suppose there are precedents among spaghetti Westerns of the 60s (like The Great Silence) but Italians are stoic about their violence whereas Tarantino seems to be whacking off to his own mayhem. Related Stories Oscar Futures Can The Hateful Eight Earn 8 or More Nominations? Kurt Russell on Stockholm Syndrome and the Unique Bond Between His Hateful Eight Co-Stars Jennifer Jason Leigh on the Joys of Making The Hateful Eight and Not Being Afraid to Get Punched As usual his foreplay is brilliant. Hell most of what he does is brilliant. Samuel Jackson is bounty hunter Marquis Warren who gets caught in a blizzard en route to Red Rock and begs a ride in a stagecoach with another hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his prisoner Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Russells John Wayne affect is promptly dispelled when he whomps Daisy (who already has two black eyes) across the face breaking her nose. A short time later her jaw is fractured. But still she mouths off showing a macabre broken grin wearing her battered face as a badge of honor crowing like a Shakespearean witch. What a performance The movie proper begins when the occupants of the coach take shelter at a place called Minnies Haberdashery -- only Minnie and her crew arent around replaced by among others Demian Bichir as a scarily furtive Mexican Tim Roth as a scarily furtive Englishman and Michael Madsen as a scarily furtive mamas boy. Apparently at least. Walton Goggins plays a man who says hes Red Rocks next sheriff not likely. Bruce Dern is a curiously morose ex-Confederate general. The feel is uneasy pregnant. As Tarantino takes the measure of the space (via Robert Richardsons breathtakingly sharp cinematography which captures the grain on the overhead beams) the men take the measure of one another. Beat by beat Tarantino teases you with the idea that violence can erupt any second and the non-action goes on and on to the edge of the intermission. Damn the man is good at winding around the central conflict. Jacksons Marquis becomes a sort of detective a frontier Poirot or Charlie Chan registering tiny details (a jellybean on the floor bad coffee but good stew) while enduring Tarantinos patented promiscuous use of the N-word. But this is after all a short time after the Civil War the era that goes by the misnomer ""Reconstruction"" when bands of Confederates transformed themselves easily sometimes gratefully into murderous outlaws righteous in their barbarity. As in Django Unchained Tarantino makes you itch for the black man to let slip own his dogs of war. But when the violence comes its more graphic and nausea-inducing than even a hardened Tarantino viewer could have reason to expect. In an extended flashback Tarantino crosses into Rob Zombie snuff territory a description he might well regard as a badge of honor (the bastard) but one I see as emblematic of his descent into a kind of shock-jock territory that dishonors his early work. Consider his last one-set bloodbath Reservoir Dogs nowhere near as accomplished a piece of moviemaking but full of psychological cross-currents and emotional quandaries. Tarantino has left emotional quandaries behind. Hes in the grindhouse revenge ether now high on his own silly can-you-top-this gross-out carnage. You wonder what he has up his sleeve in The Hateful Eight but gorgeous as that sleeve might be whats up it is crap. The movie is a lot of gore over a lot of nothing. I hope that wont be Tarantinos epitaph. A version of this article appears in the December 28 2015 issue of New York Magazine.

They encounter a handful of other bounty hunters on the way including Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson). (  / The Weinstein Company) Quentin Tarantinos ""The Hateful Eight"" arrives strutting and fretting with cinematic significance Now playing in its big-screen ""roadshow"" version its been lovingly photographed on archaic 7omm film stock its presentation preceded by a breathtaking overture by spaghetti-Western maestro Ennio Morricone and interrupted midway through by an intermission. Tarantino an outspoken champion for preserving endangered genres and platforms wears his passions so earnestly that its all the more disappointing when the actual movie turns out to be so puny. Hes thrown everything he has in scale style scope and self-importance at what amounts to a cramped if initially colorful parlor game. ""The Hateful Eight"" never lives up to its intriguing opening minutes and provocative premise its wide-screen canvas wasted on a talky claustrophobic chamber piece that descends in due Tarantino fashion into a mean-spirited slough of bloodshed and mayhem. This is not to suggest that ""The Hateful Eight"" doesnt have its promising moments. The film which takes place in the Wyoming hills in the late 19th century has been marvelously shot by the great Robert Richardson whose vast snowscapes and unerring eye for grandeur anticipate ""The Revenant"" opening in a week or two. After some magnificent shots of the surrounding vistas however the film finds its true focus starting with a motley crew traveling by carriage to a town called Red Rock and ending at a lonely cabin called Minnies Haberdashery where the titular cast of characters embarks on a profane chamber piece of shaggy-dog soliloquies as windy as the landscape outside. Samuel L. Jackson stars as Union veteran Marquis Warren in ""The Hateful Eight."" (Andrew Cooper/The Weinstein Company) The players in this wordy roundelay include the bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell); his latest quarry Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh); a legendary Union veteran named Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson); and a former confederate soldier played by Walton Goggins. When the foursome takes shelter at Minnies to ride out a blizzard they find their mirror image in a group already ensconced including an aged Confederate general (Bruce Dern); a prim British-accented gentleman played by Tim Roth; a taciturn loner (Michael Madsen); and a mustached figure known only as Mexican Bob (Demian Bichir). For those keeping score at home more than the nominal number of characters come and go in ""The Hateful Eight"" which evokes the hermetic atmosphere and taut psychological underpinnings of such classics as ""Stagecoach"" and ""The Petrified Forest"" but eventually winds up feeling more like a hysterically pitched live-action version of ""Clue."" Casting immediate suspicion on whos in cahoots with whom and trying mightily to sustain interest as red herrings blow in through the cabins busted door (an amusing bit of recurring business) Tarantino arranges and rearranges his characters the better to speechify spout racist and sexist epithets and spin yarns -- especially Warren whose jeremiads Jackson infuses with booming basso-profundo force. For its theatrical staging and verbal arias alone ""The Hateful Eight"" possesses some degree of enjoyment even if Tarantinos meditations on post-Civil War race relations feel more opportunistic than observant. Whats more the links he makes between the commodified bodies of bounty hunting and enslavement feel warmed over from ""Django Unchained."" In that 2012 movie the filmmakers analogies felt audacious and improbably on-point. Here theyre no more than convenient scaffolding for the violent excesses that when you get to the down and dirty essence of most Tarantino films have always interested him most. (L to R) Kurt Russell Jennifer Jason Leigh and Bruce Dern in ""The Hateful Eight"" a film set in post-Civil War Wyoming. (Andrew Cooper/The Weinstein Company) Even in the midst of what amounts to a Wild West death trip a few performances in ""The Hateful Eight"" stand out especially Derns quietly wild-eyed depiction of an embittered Lost Causer; Gogginss note-perfect very funny rendition of a slow-witted cowpoke; and Russells simultaneous channeling of John Wayne and Yosemite Sam. Although nearly everyone gets it in the neck eventually (one more graphically than the others) its the cackling spitting Leigh who comes in for the most abuse in a story that has her chained to her captor for much of the running time. Cracked on the head elbowed in the nose burned vomited on and ultimately relieved of her two front teeth shes also the first character to utter the racial slur thats as recurrent as the random punches and socks to the jaw. The climactic bloodletting may make for merry times for fanboys and fetishists but its difficult to reconcile Tarantinos infectious joie de vivre with the scorched-earth nihilism he uses it to celebrate. Hes compared ""The Hateful Eight"" to an Agatha Christie mystery suggesting a cozy world being temporarily upended but finally set to rights. No such reassurance is forthcoming in what is finally a tiresome self-indulgent burlesque of grindhouse gore-mongering albeit one festooned with pseudo-deep ideas about Americas toxic racial legacy. Even Professor Plum with an entire armamentarium of candlesticks and lead pipes at his disposal couldnt dream up a game this airless there-less and finally clueless. R. At area theaters.

"The Hateful Eight review Quentin Tarantinos Western a widescreen dullard - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Hateful Eight review Quentin Tarantinos Western a widescreen dullard Hateful Eight The Weinstein Company Kurt Russell left and Samuel L. Jackson star in ""The Hateful Eight."" Kurt Russell left and Samuel L. Jackson star in ""The Hateful Eight."" (The Weinstein Company) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""The Hateful Eight"" is an ultrawide bore. If you have the option and youre committed to seeing the thing you should see Quentin Tarantinos latest in one of its 100 or so limited-release ""roadshow"" screenings projected on film complete with overture (a lovely eerie one from the great composer Ennio Morricone) and running just over three hours. After that itll be the conventional digital projection editions at the multiplexes running 20 minutes shorter.Writer-director Tarantino has described his post-Civil War picture set largely in a Wyoming roadhouse with a blizzard raging outside as an Agatha Christie Western. Its not so much a shoot-em-up (though the violence is outlandishly rough when it comes) as a guess-em-up. Now and then one of the duplicitous weasels braves the cold (the film was shot largely near Telluride Colo.) to remind us where we are and what the scenery looks like. Im all for the old-school 70 millimeter whomp of ""The Hateful Eight."" Having seen it both digitally and on film its clear to me the 70mm roadshow film version looks bigger brighter clearer movie-er. Shooting on film for a blissfully spacious 2.761 aspect ratio cinematographer Robert Richardson saturates every stewpot and blood spurt pouring scads of heavenly light down on the actors even when theres no plausible light source for the effect.I just wish the results didnt feel like 70 minutes of viable story taffy-pulled out to a brazen length. Tarantinos a born writer but hes not a born self-editor of his own writerly blab. The script here is riddled with showy rhetorical flourishes and tedious running gags one being how often Tarantino can work in the N-word as both a facetious and ""serious"" example of casual venal racism. Similarly some of the violence is meant to be sobering whether directed at black characters or white scoundrels or the much-abused female lead a murderous prisoner played by Jennifer Jason Leigh. But most of the splatter when things go bonkers is strictly for sadistic kicks. Its a strange blend this movie an Ultra Panavision 70 spectacular (the first since 1966) that takes place mostly around tables. The entrances and exits are consciously theatrical when theyre not paying direct homage to the primary ""Hateful Eight"" influences which include such TV series as ""Bonanza"" and ""The Virginian."" Various observers have noted a particular debt owed to the ""Fair Game"" episode of the lesser-known series ""The Rebel."" Whatever; Tarantinos a magpie a mashup artist and always has been. When the movies work the movies work. The idea here I think was to slowly increase the heat on a pressure-cooker scenario. The experience (mine at least) of it is more like the air going blllllllpppppptttt out of an overinflated balloon. Trailer The Hateful Eight Official trailer for ""The Hateful Eight."" Official trailer for ""The Hateful Eight."" See more videos The War between the States a few years past but hardly settled rages along with the blizzard inside Minnies Haberdashery. Tarantinos motley travelers include bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell fantastically bewhiskered) and his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) bound for Red Rock and the hangmans noose. In the opening scene their six-horse stagecoach meets up with another bounty hunter Major Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) a Civil War veteran with a bloody resume and a slab of corpses ready for delivery to Red Rock. Warren corresponded with Abraham Lincoln and he carries his famous ""Lincoln letter"" with him always. Also on the snowy road is the new sheriff of Red Rock (Walton Goggins) who really doesnt seem like sheriff material.At Minnies Minnie herself is oddly absent. The guests wait out the storm with a tight-lipped Confederate general (Bruce Dern); a tight-lipped cowpoke (Michael Madsen unable to stop playing with his hair); a voluble Englishman (Tim Roth extremely welcome); and their nominal host Bob (Demian Bichir). The opening credits promise appearances by among others Channing Tatum but any more would wander into spoiler territory. Everyone in ""The Hateful Eight"" tells one story and hides another and the sexually goading monologue (set ironically to ""Silent Night"") Jackson delivers just before the intermission is I think the splitter for this movie. If you find the speech arresting and effective youre in for the duration. If you dont youre probably already wondering why Tarantino struggles to activate the film rhythmically dramatically visually. Tarantino can do many things but hes not one to move the camera within a shot in unexpected ways.The actors do what they can. Russells the anchor and unlike Jackson (whos good anyway) Russell seems like a 19th century artifact not a 21st century gloss on the past. Its sad Morricone didnt compose a full score; too much of the soundtrack is taken up with deliberately anachronistic musical selections and music Morricone wrote for earlier projects. Tarantino doesnt care about hewing to plausible notions of period filmmaking. But as the bodies pile up in the second half along with the switchback narrative reveals ""The Hateful Eight"" becomes a hermetically sealed exercise of a dispiriting sort. Back in the late 1990s Tarantino played Broadway in a short-lived revival of ""Wait Until Dark"" a stage thriller thats all exposition in the first act and a couple of prime payoffs in the second. The shotgun-blasting face-removal payoffs here may be enough for some. But I suspect that Tarantinos big secret is a simple one He knows deep down that he overwrote the living daylights out of this one.

Its also a bloodbath even more of a bloodbath than most of Tarantinos other movies. If ""The Hateful Eight"" lacks something its that extra quality that ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"" had a larger purpose a vision of history that made sense of all the bloodletting and left audiences with a feeling of having engaged with an important subject. In those films Tarantinos virtuosity was in service of something bigger while ""The Hateful Eight"" is virtuosity in service of itself. Still virtuosity is virtuosity and if you see ""The Hateful Eight"" youll see an almost three-hour film that never drags that is enjoyable from beginning to end. All the more impressive is that Tarantino accomplishes this with one hand tied behind his back as it were At least 90 minutes of the film takes place in real time with the same characters in one large room a cabin where they are sitting out a snowstorm. Its ironic that Tarantino actually considered transforming the screenplay to ""The Hateful Eight"" into a novel after a copy was leaked to the Internet last year. What he has created is not just a movie but a full-blown old-fashioned extravaganza -- shot in 70 millimeter and featuring an overture and an intermission. As in the classic era the credits play over the theme music (by Ennio Morricone) before anything happens. We just watch as from a distance a stagecoach rides through thick snow struggling to get ahead of a storm. From the movies first moments even before a word is spoken Tarantino evokes the big Technicolor Westerns. He has internalized the look and tropes of the genre the way other people might internalize their religious background. These old movies are his sacred texts. He loves them and he sends them up but he also does them for real. He harnesses their power even as hes winking at us. In this way he creates a universe in which its possible for example for Kurt Russell to give an effective dramatic performance even as its clear that hes shamelessly imitating John Wayne. Russell plays a bounty hunter known as the Hangman and as the film begins he is transporting Daisy (Jennifer Jason Leigh) a notorious murderer to her hanging. Along the way he picks up another bounty hunter Marquis (Samuel L. Jackson) a former Civil War major in a black regiment; and the towns newly elected sheriff a former Confederate soldier played by an interesting actor named Walton Goggins (TVs ""Justified"")  who has an edge of bug-eyed menace. Leigh doesnt do much but listen in her first scene but she gives off such an aura of moral and psychological perversity that she becomes the focus. In casting her in this way Tarantino shows a complete understanding of what this extraordinary underused actress means and what she can do She has no vanity and no limits. She will go to the depths of darkness and wonder why its so bright in there. Theres no degradation or horror she wont explore and yet theres a quality of deadpan humor about her too a self-awareness thats funny. To put it plainly Leigh is so twisted and sick and amazing in this film that at times youll almost not believe what youre seeing. So the air is already thick in ""The Hateful Eight"" before the travelers find shelter in a boardinghouse. There Tarantino introduces us to another group of suspicious characters. Theres the old Confederate general (Bruce Dern) sitting by the fire; a mystery man who sits off by himself writing (Michael Madsen); a Mexican who tends the horses (Demian Bichir); and an English dandy played by Tim Roth. As soon as Roth speaks one cant help but wish he were a German dandy played by Christoph Waltz. Waltzs absence is felt throughout but there really wasnt a role here both right for him and worthy of him. Aside from an opening scene ""The Hateful Eight"" takes place almost entirely at that cabin and what happens there should stay there -- for you to discover on your own. Tarantino has put together a terrific ensemble a mix of first-timers and people he has worked with in the past. The film is mostly told through the eyes of Marquis which is right Aside from Waltz no other actor but Jackson understands so well the Tarantino tone -- a mix of drama melodrama and absurdity. But Goggins definitely shows an instinct for it and its good to see Madsen who now that James Gandolfini is gone has undisputed claim to the least reassuring smile in movies. As for the violence everyone has a different threshold for it. There were a couple of moments that I considered almost stomach-turning but then there were others just as extreme that I found enormously funny. Needless to say if ""Inglourious Basterds"" and ""Django Unchained"" were too much for you ""The Hateful Eight"" wont be any easier. This is a big step beyond.

Jackson in The Hateful Eight. All the promise of the first hour of the film is squandered in the last two Quentin Tarantino has always been openhearted about his love for spaghetti westerns particularly those of Sergio Corbucci. Though Corbucci is less well known in the States than his splashier counterpart Sergio Leone his best pictures--like the 1966 Django featuring Franco Nero as a raggedy gunfighter who drags a coffin like an inconvenient suitcase wherever he goes--have an earthy fortitude that not even Leone quite matches. The rogues who people Corbuccis films do terrible things without remorse and their faces are roadmaps of scowls and sneers carrying the scars of that. Tarantino has said of Corbucci ""He loves the uglies"" and Tarantino does too as anyone who has ever adored one (or more) of his movies can attest. But is he a man who loves too much? The first third of Tarantinos eighth movie The Hateful Eight is unassailably beautiful. This is a western set in snow country and those are more rare than you might think Robert Altmans McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Corbuccis The Great Silence are two superb examples but when most people think ""westerns"" its the scrubby desert majesty of John Ford that comes to mind. Tarantino and his frequent cinematographer Robert Richardson introduce us to a world--post-Civil War Wyoming to be exact--in which the Inuits quasi-mythical abundance of words for ""snow"" have been translated into an un-color wheel of satin grays sable blacks and primal whites with millions of gradations in between. In the opening sequence a dappled ashy form that appears to be a gnarled tree turns out to be a stone crucifix partly obscured by pillowy snow a forgotten Jesus in a godforsaken land. But that early visual is a ruse a gorgeously cinematic red herring that does nothing to prepare us for the meandering dialogue blase brutality and intellectual and spiritual murkiness that lie ahead. All the promise of the first hour of The Hateful Eight is squandered in the last two once the action heads indoors What begins as a wickedly chilly adventure--one that seems committed to using every inch of the rare ultra-wide 70mm format that Tarantino so lovingly resurrected for this film--evolves into a frostbitten claustrophobic chamber piece in which an assortment of eight (or so) miscreants and neer-do-wells snowbound in a remote mercantile establishment debase one another verbally and otherwise--until only bits of them barely fit for crows are left. Samuel L. Jackson plays bounty hunter and former Union soldier Major Marquis Warren long-legged and loping in an inky cape-shouldered military coat and broad-brimmed hat. Any filmmaker might want to make a western just to put Jackson in this kind of getup and who could blame him? Warren surly yet principled is headed for the nearest far-away town Red Rock--hes got a few armloads of dead bodies to deliver--and hops a ride on a stagecoach passing through Its passengers are fellow bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) a ruffian in a scrubby fur coat and the outlaw hes captured tough little Wild West urchin Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Daisys left eye is ringed by a hell of a shiner and it doesnt take long to figure out that Ruth is the one who gave it to her. He smacks her often and with escalating bravado in what becomes the movies defining running joke The more she gets hit the more she grins and cackles as if she were drawing banshee strength from the abuse--a notion that may seem like misogyny but is in fact its triumphant opposite. At some point belligerent bigoted Sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) also wedges himself into that coach. Its drawn by a half-dozen handsome stamping horses trying to outrun an encroaching snow storm and it will eventually end up at Minnies Haberdashery a popular stopping-off point for weary travelers. Huddled inside are a hangman with oily-impeccable manners Tim Roths Owaldo Mobray Michael Madsens cowboy scribe Joe Gage and Bruce Derns General Sandy Smithers a classic Confederate racist who naturally gets right under Major Warrens skin The centerpiece of their inflamed encounter is a protracted story involving a key part of Warrens anatomy and some of the creative uses hes found for it. As with Tarantinos 2012 Django Unchained the woolly rambling dialogue here focuses largely on race--or more specifically the scourge of racism. The N-word flows freely here as it did in Django Unchained though in that film its use was more pointedly historical--plus it was always clear from a characters mannerisms and tone of voice how it was being used. In The Hateful Eight the word is most often folded into a kind of stylized riffing potentially offensive if that sort of thing troubles you and nearly invisible--and thus ineffectual--if it doesnt. So why use it at all? Its easy to see that The Hateful Eight is ""about"" racism though its unclear exactly what Tarantino is trying to say other than hes against it--and we already knew that. Tarantino has populated his film with intentionally unlikable characters one of the most thrilling gambles a filmmaker can take The challenge--one met for example by Sam Peckinpah with The Wild Bunch and Brian De Palma with Scarface--is to make us care for them in all their flawed splendor. But theres so little human grandeur naughty or nice in The Hateful Eight. Thats all the more frustrating in the context of how much Tarantino gets right The action as always in his movies is crisp and specific. The score by Ennio Morricone as close to being a deity as they come is both majestic and delicate its grand spaces filled with tendrils of feeling--but its as if the music can feel something we cant. The characters here seem only half-formed. They talk a lot but its as if theyre trying--and failing--to argue their way toward some interior defining truth. (Daisy Domergue as Leigh plays her is the exception. We know what shes thinking every minute and we love her more even when what shes thinking is wholly repugnant.) The Hateful Eight moves slowly--its ambitious in its languor. But when the major violence does kick in it feels pinched and mingy rather than resplendent which is uncharacteristic for Tarantino. The brutality here is sometimes viciously funny Heads are blown open their pinky-red contents filling the air like mini-geysers. If bloody projectile vomit is your thing theres some of that too. But even in Reservoir Dogs perhaps Tarantinos most heartlessly violent picture theres at least a bedrock of chilly passion lying beneath the brutality and an honesty too after all our collective love for movie violence is a kind of lamour fou. In The Hateful Eight the violence if occasionally entertaining is never sorrowful or cathartic or complex in any way and before long its casual cruelty becomes a kind of blandness. At one point the movies most buoyant and likable character suffering from a gunshot would begs to be spared--only to be finished off ruthlessly. The moment is so horrifying you could almost laugh but laughing would hurt too much. People do terrible things in The Hateful Eight--no matter what you make of the movie the title doesnt disappoint. But its glorious snow-capped visuals aside The Hateful Eight comes off as haggard and atrophied. Its bloodless even in the midst of all its bloodiness; its characters are devoid of nobility even the horrible kind. These are uglies not even a mother could love.

Close Join the conversation... With Chris Vognar Share This Story Share Discuss Meh Put your hand in your pocket real slow-like and get out your wallet. Youll want to buy a ticket for The Hateful Eight the Western that Quentin Tarantino was born to make.Long taut and never boring Hateful has all the ingredients weve come to expect from Tarantino Profane belly laughs explosive violence sadistic flourishes and expertly drawn-out tension. But this winters tale finds the cinema-savvy filmmaker stretching his legs out and relaxing a little taking a load off by the fire and savoring the power dynamics hes constructed much as his actors savor every word that rolls from their tongues.The film rides one of those easily summarized premises that offer room for infinite elasticity Eight unsavory characters trapped by a blizzard in a post-Civil War Wyoming saloon with suspicion and murder on their minds. It all plays out like a cross between The Petrified Forest and Ten Little Indians with some Once Upon a Time in the West widescreen splendor to make it pop. (The Hateful Eight opens in 70 millimeter this week in select theaters before going wide next week in standard digital format).Ive heard directors laugh at the idea of coaxing great performances from gifted actors insisting that the performers are fully responsible. But The Hateful Eight reminds us that all great actors raise their game for a Tarantino epic. The Hateful octet which indeed riffs and melds like a seasoned jazz ensemble includes Jennifer Jason Leigh Kurt Russell Samuel L. Jackson Walton Goggins Tim Roth Michael Madsen Demian Bichir and Bruce Dern. They are Union and Confederate young and old black white and Mexican ornery mean and hilarious.Its hard to pick a standout. Leigh burrows deep for the wanted outlaw Daisy Domergue a nearly feral slice of trashy snarling disregard. Russell puts a modern gloss on John Wayne as the bounty hunter taking her to hang. Jackson carries long sections as a Union veteran-turned-bounty hunter with an air of rugged dignity. There are no subpar performances here.But for my money its Goggins the patron saint of hillbillies who steals the show. Anyone who watched Justified knows Goggins gift for mixing menace and comic timing his expressive eyes and mouth that breaks into a maniacal grin at a moments notice. He has more fun with Tarantinos dialogue than anyone else here as a former Confederate raider twisting off each word with a moonshine twang.Alliances form dissolve and and re-assemble; grudges are sustained; feelings are hurt. As much as any other Tarantino movie The Hateful Eight moves about in its own vivid universe. That universe is comprised largely of older filmic conventions; Tarantino is ever the cinema savant. But the frequent complaint that all of his reference points go back to the big screen rather than any common humanity is starting to ring hollow. The hateful eight may be nasty but theyre mighty fun to hang out with. (Robert Wilonsky disagrees; you can watch us fight it out on Reel Genius below). Then theres this Tarantinos grasp of film craft has never been stronger and he always surrounds himself with an all-star team of technicians. The two below-the-line stars of Hateful are cinematographer Robert Richardson and composer Ennio Morricone. Richardson brings poetry to the mountainous outdoor sequences including a trail of blood in the snow that looks like drizzled chocolate syrup and he navigates the space of the saloon with lyrical precision. Morricone conjures a persistent mood of impending melodic dread.If you dig a little deeper youll find a tale of Civil War reconciliation that only a fiendish mind could conceive. Tarantino as has been his wont in recent years is gleefully messing with history and with movie genre (at one point The Hateful Eight unfolds like a horror Western). If he can keep doing it with this kind of panache he can tinker as long as he wants.The Hateful Eight (A)Directed by Quentin Tarantino.

Kurt Russells Hateful Eight his latest in a career full of reinventions Related Videos The Hateful Eight Trailer With his love of genre violence salty language and often despicable characters whom we learn to appreciate from a safe distance Quentin Tarantino courts controversy along with loathing love and respect. So it is that The Hateful Eight -- a western set in the Rocky Mountains years after the U.S. Civil War -- has become a lightning rod for that controversy. Despite its 19th century period story Tarantino deliberately was writing and directing a picture about 21st century racial violence and police brutality. Even if the film itself does not spell out its metaphor -- because the filmmaker is an artist and an auteur not a demagogue -- Tarantino and his muse and star actor Samuel L. Jackson have spelled out its meaning in public statements. A multitude of American policemen have vowed to boycott the film primarily for what Tarantino has said about his motives. The Hateful Eight is a lesser work than his masterpiece Pulp Fiction or his savage WWII fantasy Inglourious Basterds or his powerful slave-western Django Unchained. It does have its own glory however and a whole posse of incredible characters few of them heroic or even clean and respectable. Layer in Tarantinos sparkling dialogue explode the joint with a lot of swearing and N bombs and The Hateful Eight is a crackling yarn with a deep well of meaning and socio-political commentary. The plot is fairly simple even if the filmmaking is complex (not least because Tarantino shot this in Ultra Panavision 70 an updated old-school film technique with an extreme widescreen aspect ratio). As a blizzard approaches a group of people bear down on a stagecoach stop in a mountain pass. We see two groups arrive one in the here-and-now the other in a flashback sequence that sets the gears in motion for what will happen inside Minnies Haberdashery. Plenty of people will die some by puking out poison and some with their brains blown sky-high and room-wide. All of the bloody violence is both horrific and comedic. Once again Tarantino creates an artsy drama with exploitation-style action. The eight of the title are the core characters although more people are involved. Each is a singular character. At the core is the ebullient Jackson as Major Marquis Warren a bounty hunter carrying a signed letter he got from Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. Also standing out perhaps to the point of an Oscar nom is Jennifer Jason Leigh as the venal outlaw Daisy Domergue. The other six ""hateful"" types are Kurt Russells John Ruth the bounty hunter chained to Daisy and eager for the reward; Tim Roths Oswaldo Mobray fastidious hangman at the nearby town of Red Rock; Michael Madsens Joe Gage a cowpoke writing his diary; Bruce Dern as the curmudgeonly Confederate General Smithers; Demian Bichir as Bob the mysterious Mexican; and scene-stealing career-making Walton Goggins as Chris Mannix the Confederate rebel who claims to be Red Rocks new sheriff. Other actors appear in smaller support roles including a slick turn by Channing Tatum as a well-coifed perfectly dressed badass gunslinger named Jody. Tarantino claims to have been inspired by hostage-taking episodes of classic TV westerns such as Bonanza and The Virginian. Of course a Tarantino twist makes those shows unrecognizable as templates. The Hateful Eight is uniquely its own animal. Also Tarantino related the sudden shifts in the action make for some mixed-up allegiances. Especially when Jacksons character -- the only black man in the room -- is involved with men who still support slavery. This is when The Hateful Eight becomes as much about today as it is about the Wild West frontier times in America. Two versions are being released One is the shorter (yet still long) cut; the other is the extended ""Roadshow"" version complete with an intermission and even more of Ennio Morricones epic-style musical score. The Hateful Eight opens in limited release Christmas Day before expanding wide on Jan. 1. QUENTIN TARANTINO MOVIES RANKED FROM BEST TO WORST Americas enfant terrible Quentin Tarantino is now a veteran filmmaker at 52. He has even tossed around vague plans to retire from directing by 60. With The Hateful Eight set for release the former video store clerk with the passion for cinema now has written and directed eight features (or nine if you count the two parts of Kill Bill as separate titles). We rank them 1 -- Pulp Fiction (1994) Outrageously Tarantinos masterpiece lost to Forrest Gump as best picture at the Oscars. This pulpy sexy sensational crime comedy earned Tarantino the Palme dOr at Cannes. And as a consolation prize the Oscar for best original screenplay (shared with story collaborator Roger Avary a Canadian from Flin Flon Man.). 2 -- Inglourious Basterds (2009) The history of WWII and the Nazis is rewritten with intense violence a passion for Jews and plenty of fascinating twists. Brad Pitt leads a great ensemble that includes Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz. 3 -- Django Unchained (2012) Tarantinos biggest box office hit is a poignant profound and exhilarating revenge fantasy set during the slave era in America. Jamie Foxx is the cool escaped-slave hero. 4 -- Kill Bill (2002-04) Released in two parts this martial arts revenge epic co-starred Uma Thurman as the sword-wielding Bride who seeks out the savage Bill played by David Carradine. 5 -- The Hateful Eight (2015) Even at number five on Tarantinos list this mad western is great entertainment. 6 -- Reservoir Dogs (1992) Tarantinos feature film debut as director remains a mean-spirited and brilliantly conceived crime caper and torture story. The ensemble led by Harvey Keitel dazzles as they play with Tarantinos gritty dialogue. 7 -- Jackie Brown (1997) It feels wrong to have Tarantinos gonzo homage to blaxploitation movies fall so far down the list - especially with Pam Griers sexy performance in the title role. But the other titles are even greater. 8 -- Death Proof (2007) The least is definitely last. Tarantino provided half of a retro action package under the title Grindhouse. His pal Robert Rodriguez kicked in the other half the horror movie Planet Terror. Neither movie impressed with their weak stories and deliberately sloppy shooting techniques that ape the movies that inspired them.

"The Hateful Eight (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Hateful Eight (R) Quentin Tarantino writes and directs this Western about eight strangers stranded in a cabin during a winter storm. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/23/2015 Editor rating 3.5 A bounty hunter and his prisoner walk into a haberdashery waylaid by bad weather. Thats the set-up for The Hateful Eight a slow-burn talky Western in which Quentin Tarantino cashes in on the clout he earned with two unlikely hits (Inglourious Basterds Django Unchained) and makes his most indulgent longest movie to date. This is not necessarily a bad thing depending on your personal taste. Yes the movie is an epic-length (more than three hours) remix of Tarantinos greatest hits; he reworks his own storytelling tics and flourishes the way he reworked the bank-heist genre in Reservoir Dogs. Once again hes recycling other peoples works -- everything from Stagecoach to Agatha Christie Bonanza to John Carpenters The Thing -- but he melds them into something singular and bracing with an extra-large dollop of his signature ultra-violence. Set almost entirely inside a large cabin in Wyoming soon after the Civil War in which eight strangers (possibly more) have holed up to ride out a winter storm The Hateful Eight was shot by cinematographer Robert Richardson in Ultra Panavision which allows for a wider more detailed image. The 70mm roadshow version of the movie is an old-school presentation projected on film complete with overture and intermission. A shorter cut of the movie playing at most theaters runs 167 minutes with no intermission and fewer panoramic shots. The Hateful Eight is deliberately paced -- it stars off at a crawl with an opening 20 minutes that could have taken up five -- and once the action moves indoors Tarantino frames the actors carefully often giving them nothing to do but stand around and listen while others deliver monologues. The whole thing is so stagey it feels like it was intended to be a chamber play although so much blood is spilled that the theaters floorboards would warp (Tarantino goes overboard a couple of times engaging in splatter and gore for pure sensation; sometimes less is more). Tarantino has always been merciless toward his characters willing to kill off likable and despicable protagonists with the same relish. But The Hateful Eight seems particularly brutal even by his standards. Some critics have argued the film goes too far trying to mine laughs out of seeing a female outlaw (Jennifer Jason Leigh) get punched and elbowed in the face repeatedly by men or a flashback scene in which a former Union major (Samuel L. Jackson) recounts the outlandish revenge he exacted on a racist killer. But I dont think Tarantino intends these elements to be funny in the traditional sense. This is a movie about odious people -- the ""hateful"" in the title describes how they feel about each other as much as how we feel about most of them -- and he observes their behavior as coolly as they use the n-word which is dropped here as often as Tony Montana dropped f-bombs in Scarface. The movies intentionally humorous moments are plentiful and obvious (and sometimes ghastly); in other moments your mileage may vary depending on what you consider to be funny. Tarantino has been offending queasy audiences ever since Michael Madsen sliced off the cops ear in Reservoir Dogs. So why does The Hateful Eight -- which is essentially the story of a group of people stranded in a cabin playing tricks on each other -- feel different dirtier meaner? The movie doesnt deliver the giddy down-the-rabbit-hole kick of Pulp Fiction or the savage satisfaction of revenge of Inglourious Basterds. This is a grimmer more brutal movie than even Django Unchained was. Although the dialogue is grandstanding and overripe the themes in the film -- the postbellum stench of racism and slavery lingers in the cabin like the noxious smoke from a pile of burning tires -- are intended to connect with the present-day. When Jackson tells Bruce Derns ex-Confederate general ""Youve got no idea what its like being a black man staring down America"" the line resonates in todays polarized culture more than Tarantino might have imagined. There are some terrific performances in The Hateful Eight including Kurt Russell as a cagey bounty hunter who isnt quite as smart as he thinks he is; Tim Roth as an affected executioner with an accent worthy of Christoph Waltz; Demian Bichir as the caretaker of the haberdashery who is so prone to squinting he delivers some lines with his eyes shut; and Walton Goggins as a newly-minted sheriff-to-be who may or may not be crooked. Out of the bunch the standouts are Jackson once again making poetry out of Tarantinos ornate dialogue; Goggins an actor who knows how to deliver verbal curlicues with relish; and Leigh who spends so much of the movie lurking in the background that you wonder why she even took the part until you stop wondering. Thats when Tarantino reveals the truth behind all the strange intimations and hints of chicanery throughout the story and the picture transforms into something completely different. Even the score by Ennio Morricone mutates into something lusher and more operatic. The Hateful Eight is a movie about the worst aspects of human nature which is why the film cant be quite described as ""fun"" at least in the traditional sense (The Force Awakens this is not). But Tarantino isnt glorifying the ugliness; hes condemning it. He just wants to put on a grand show at the same time. ""Are you not entertained?"" he seems to be asking. Yes. Yes we are.

Along their snowy journey via stagecoach they pick up former Union soldier Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L.

Jackson is a former Union soldier turned bounty hunter in The Hateful Eight. (Photo Weinstein Company)While not as cinematically game-changing as Pulp Fiction or as gore-spattered as the Kill Bill films The Hateful Eight doles out all of Tarantinos favorite things. He crafts his usual snappy dialogue -- set to a memorable and moody Ennio Morricone score -- for a story that pays off for the most attentive moviegoers. Things in the beginning come back later a sequence set in the past nicely tidies up questions at just the right time and Hateful Eight offers one of Tarantinos more satisfying endings.His characters each have a tale to tell within the overarching story and Tarantino has brought in several members of his regular troupe such as Jackson who shows his range as Warren the de facto detective. Russell seems to be having a blast as the no-nonsense Ruth Goggins gives Mannix stereotype-busting nuance and a surprise A-lister shows up as an integral player later in the proceedings.USA TODAYComic-Cons Quentin Tarantino love-festBut the key MVP of Tarantinos three-hour showpiece -- which miraculously never seems that long -- is Leigh. As the odious femme fatale Daisy the actress spits and snarls occasionally showing different sides of the neer-do-well but remaining permanently hateful.Her face is a character arc in itself starting off with just a fresh shiner but slowly becoming a toothless mess after getting on everyones bad sides. Yet as great as she is Daisy is simply one of Tarantinos countless Hateful things to absolutely love. 28 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 6 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1OnwakV",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/12/23/review-hateful-eight-quentin-tarantino/77760880/,200,thehatefuleight24,thehatefuleight,usatoday

(roadshow edition includes intermission) By Cary Darling By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.com cdarlingdfw.comPosted 111pm on Wednesday Dec. 23 2015 Wednesday Dec. 23 2015 Monday Dec. 21 2015 By Cary Darling By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Quentin Tarantino certainly knows how to grab attention.His latest film The Hateful Eight has been the source of controversy for much of the year. The director threatened to scuttle the whole thing after an early script was leaked online and he later demanded that his near-three-hour epic be shown in 70 MM Panavision -- with an intermission -- where at all possible.As with his last film Django Unchained the bombastic Tarantino still has no qualms about wading into issues of race in America a topic that remains as polarizing as they come. Throw in the usual Tarantino tropes of sudden spasms of bloody violence with enough profanity to make David Mamet blush and The Hateful Eight is an easy film to admire for its creators singular and distinct vision. But its tough movie to love.The roadshow edition of Hateful -- which is how Tarantino prefers it to be seen -- is a throwback to the 50s and early 60s when big films like Ben Hur and Cleopatra were treated more like stage plays or operas with a prologue and intermission. These movies were events. Hateful apes that with a musical prologue featuring the score from legendary Italian composer Ennio Morricone as well as the intermission. Adding to the allure is that Tarantino along with cinematographer Robert Richardson make the film look as if it is indeed from a previous era.This is all really cool but the problem is that The Hateful Eight underneath all the newsworthy layers and Tarantino flourishes isnt all that compelling a story.Set in a snowy corner of the mountain West in the post-Civil War 1800s it traps bounty hunters John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and Maj. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) in a cabin with Ruths foul-mouthed prisoner/punching bag Daisy (a go-for-broke Jennifer Jason Leigh) racist Confederate sheriff Chris Mannix (the always excellent Walton Goggins) Confederate Gen. Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) and three others -- Bob (Demian Bichir) Joe (Michael Madsen) Oswaldo (Tim Roth) -- who may or may not be who they say they are.Everyone knows that with this setup and with Tarantino at the helm these eight characters arent just going to roast marshmallows until the weather clears. Still with a tighter edit the film might have generated more tension; the first half is especially slow-going.As for the racial politics Tarantinos ""cant we all just get along after we massacre a few people in this room"" message and throwing the n-word around like its confetti isnt particularly profound. His message might carry more weight if the film was set in contemporary America instead of as here and in Django in the safe haze of the past. In that sense Spike Lees wildly adventurous Chi-Raq is more rewarding.There are some funny biting lines and its a hoot to see the likes of Dern Russell Jackson Goggins and Jason Leigh riffing off each other. As usual Jackson earns the spotlight though he has played this kind of character many times before. And the entire 70MM effort seems wasted since much of the film takes place inside a single room.Still theres nothing else out there like The Hateful Eight. It just could have been something more.

"Hateful Eight The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hateful-eight-the ) Hateful Eight The (United States 2015) December 22 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli The credits for The Hateful Eight proudly proclaim this to be the ""Eighth Film"" from writer/director Quentin Tarantino. Since catching the movie world unawares with his powerhouse debut Reservoir Dogs some 23 years ago he has worked on his own schedule refusing to be rushed into churning out product just to keep his name in the conversation. As a result Tarantino hasnt made a genuine dud yet. Even his less successful efforts (like the bifurcated Kill Bill Volume 1 and Volume 2) have at least been interesting. Of directors working today perhaps only Scorsese and Nolan can match him for consistency. Of course Tarantino doesnt appeal to everyone and when considering his body of work that has to be acknowledged. His movies are hard-R replete with profanity and graphic violence. Those who cant stomach that sort of thing will find The Hateful Eight like its seven feature length predecessors to be nearly unwatchable. For everyone else however this is a high-wire thriller full of masterfully executed twists captivating dialogue and a wildly entertaining narrative that gallops along at a pace to make three hours evaporate in an instant. Best film of the year? Yes. The Hateful Eight is an homage to the Westerns of the 60s. Shot in 70 mm with an orchestral score by Ennio Morricone a full overture and an intermission the structure resembles some of the greatest studio productions of the mid-20th century. Similarities end there however since the content of The Hateful Eight is too extreme for anything produced during that era even when adherence to the Hays Code was falling by the wayside. As is Tarantinos wont the movie wallows in blood gore violence and profanity. Its not a nice film but it is wildly entertaining. Gallows humor abounds - so much so that some critics circles and awards ceremonies are considering this a ""comedy."" I wouldnt go that far but there are instances when Tarantinos tongue is planted in his cheek. The Hateful Eight is divided into six chapters. The film begins with the meeting of two famous late 19th century bounty hunters on a Wyoming road.  Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) whose preference is to favor the first option of the ""dead or alive"" label is looking for a lift to escape an approaching blizzard. He stops the coach hired by John ""Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and negotiates passage.  Ruth isnt alone. He has a prisoner with him Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) who has a 10000 bounty on her head. Unlike Warren Ruth prefers to bring in his prisoners alive. His reason to keep the hangman employed. Before reaching their stopover at Minnies Haberdashery the coach gains a fourth passenger former rebel soldier and frontier lawman-to-be Sherriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) whos none-too-thrilled about sharing a ride with a black man. At Minnies the newcomers encounter the other four members of the hateful eight Bob the Mexican (Demian Bichir) who is ""temporarily"" running the place; (genuine) hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth); Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) a man of few words; and Confederate war hero General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern). With the inclement weather trapping these people in a confined space tensions are bound to flare. The majority of The Hateful Eight chronicles the interaction among this octet not all of whom are representing themselves truthfully. If theres one thing a viewer can expect from a Tarantino film its that nothing will happen as anticipated. Unpredictability is the single most important asset evident in the directors oeuvre. It doesnt matter how many movies you have seen or how familiar you may be with the tropes of the genre Tarantino never fails to surprise and it happens more than once in The Hateful Eight. The film presents the appearance of a Western incorporates elements of post-Civil War racism (and its consequences) offers instances of violence delivered with Tarantinos signature dark humor and uses quirky and sometimes unexpectedly erudite dialogue to tie everything together. Theres a betrayal a whodunit and suspense thicker than pea soup. As is typical of Tarantino the actors deliver high energy performances. The cast is eclectic - a mixture of first-timers and returning members of the directors repertoire company. Samuel L. Jackson leads the pack marking the sixth time he has made a contribution to a Tarantino film (the only absences being Reservoir Dogs and Kill Bill Volume 1). His performance is intense and profane although not as deliciously overbearing as in Pulp Fiction. Kurt Russell offering his best John Wayne impersonation makes his second appearance for Tarantino having previously starred in the ""Death Proof"" segment of Grindhouse. Veteran Bruce Dern adds some old-school appeal. Jennifer Jason Leigh is the only female although no one would make the mistake of calling Daisy ""feminine."" Channing Tatum has a small but memorable role as someone who despite not being one of the eight shouldnt be discounted. Tarantino made The Hateful Eight with the widescreen Westerns of a bygone era in mind. The ""roadshow"" version available only in 70 mm during the films two-week early engagement showcases the directors love for sweeping landscape shots and makes the most effective use of Morricones evocative score (which recalls his own work for Sergio Leone and Elmer Bernsteins classic The Magnificent Seven). The general release edit of The Hateful Eight is more fast-paced and claustrophobic eliminating some of the grand vista shots and removing the intermission. In terms of its overall tone and approach The Hateful Eight is closer to Django Unchained than anything else Tarantino has made. The level of violence however and the gallows humor is closer to Pulp Fiction. And while no Tarantino movie is likely to top Inglourious Basterds for sheer audacity The Hateful Eight comes close. Just when you think youve figured out where its going... youre probably wrong. No 2015 film has energized me to the degree that The Hateful Eight did and although Ill acknowledge the movies extremes may put it beyond the comfort level of some viewers those who have enjoyed Tarantinos past efforts will find that the year ends with a treat.

Photo Andrew Cooper/The Weinstein Company MOVIE REVIEW The Hateful Eight Running time 182 minutes plus intermission. Rated R (bloody violence graphic nudity and sex profanity). A purloined script leaked on the Internet with a furious Quentin Tarantino temporarily abandoning the project. A threat of a boycott after the director branded cops as killers. And rolling the film out in a limited ""roadshow"" release in the long-obsolete 70mm film format complete with overture and intermission. Tarantinos latest and least the comic Western ""The Hateful Eight"" is far less entertaining or interesting than its years-long buildup which has been even longer and more annoying than the one for ""Star Wars The Force Awakens."" All this hype and for what? Three hours or so -- the general-release version opening Dec. 31 runs a mere 167 minutes without an intermission -- set mostly in a single room where the unsavory guests and staff trade juvenile and racist insults periodically murdering each other. I was hoping theyd get it over with already well before the intermission. There are far too many gratuitous shots of a blizzard raging in the Wyoming landscape as a stagecoach heads for Red Rock where bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) plans to collect a reward for turning over fugitive murderer Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Along the way they pick up Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) a notorious bounty hunter whos a former slave and Union officer; and Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) a Confederate veteran who claims to be the new sheriff of Red Rock. Samuel L. Jackson in ""The Hateful Eight.""Photo Andrew Cooper/The Weinstein Company At a stagecoach stopover they meet up with the other half of the titular octet Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) who introduces himself as the hangman of Red Rock; laconic cowboy Joe Gage (Michael Madsen); aged Confederate Gen. Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern); and Bob (Demian Bichir) who explains hes watching the place in the owners absence. Its not exactly surprising that virtually no one is telling the truth in their long speeches which are far from Tarantinos best. That possibly includes Marquis who boasts that he sexually abused the generals son an act depicted in a graphic flashback; and Chris who asserts that Marquis locked soldiers in a burning church (mercifully not shown). When he isnt beating up Daisy -- the films least appealing running gag -- John is repeating his suspicions that one or more of the others is plotting her rescue. A subplot involving poisoned coffee demonstrates that Tarantino is no threat to Agatha Christie. The filmmaker further pulls the rug out from under the audience with a flashback sequence he personally narrates introducing another set of briefly seen characters. The most prominent is played by Channing Tatum who hams it up as badly as everybody else. ""The Hateful Eight"" is basically an expensive vanity project allowing Tarantino to expound on his bizarre theories about race relations.

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 Back in early 2014 Quentin Tarantino made a lot of noise pointing fingers bad-mouthing Hollywood agents when a draft of the screenplay for his new western The Hateful Eight leaked out on the blogosphere. More about The Hateful Eight >> ""I have no desire to make it"" the writer/director burnt and betrayed told Mike Fleming at Deadline.com. ""Ill move on to the next thing. Ive got 10 more where that came from."" Alas he must have stuffed those 10 more back in his drawer. After nursing his wounds Tarantino went and made The Hateful Eight anyhow. An epic work of self-indulgence and smug riffing stringing together tropes from TV and screen westerns and closed-room whodunits The Hateful Eight announces itself with all the pomp and circumstance of a midcentury cinema spectacle. The ""road show version"" of ""the eighth film by Quentin Tarantino"" (as per the opening credits) opening on about 100 screens Friday (it opens wider Thursday in a digital format) is projected in the 70mm film format beginning with a title card that reads ""Overture."" For more than three minutes we can shift around in our seats and stare at the static wide-screen silhouette of a stagecoach pulled by a team of horses as a (quite lovely) new Ennio Morricone score works its slow way around the room. An hour and 41 minutes into this post-Civil War tale of bad dudes bounty hunters and a foulmouthed lady outlaw an ""Intermission"" card stops everybody in their tracks. Twelve minutes later Tarantinos opus oater resumes changing tone and introducing a coachload of new characters for its concluding chapters. Despite some gorgeous establishing shots of the wintry west (white aspen forests white-clad mountains storm-clouded skies) most of The Hateful Eight takes place inside Minnies Haberdashery a stagecoach station on a mountain pass. Theres a mean blizzard a-blowin and it behooves all parties to wait out the storm in the comfort of Minnies cabin. Theres a blazing fire and she makes the best coffee in the world or so were told. There are worse ways to while away a couple of days. Then again maybe not. Jawing and chawing their way around Tarantinos cherished prose are Samuel L. Jackson as Maj. Marquis Warren a legendary Union soldier turned bounty hunter. He smokes a pipe sports a wily gleam and carries a letter from Abraham Lincoln a personal missive he is particularly proud of. Word of ""the Lincoln letter"" has gotten around. Marquis has met up with John Ruth a fellow bounty hunter escorting a prisoner via stagecoach. Kurt Russell in a fur hat and a David Crosby mustache (and talking with John Wayne cadences) is this man Ruth who keeps a close eye on his captive one Daisy Domergue (a snarling smudge-faced Jennifer Jason Leigh) a murderess he is transporting to Red Rock Wyo. to be hanged. The towns newly appointed sheriff (Walton Goggins) is making his way to Red Rock too and hitches a ride on that same stagecoach bound for its fateful stopover at Minnies. Tim Roth (a traveling hangman and a loquacious Brit) Bruce Dern (an old Confederate general) Michael Madsen (a cow puncher) and Demian Bichir (the Mexican who works for Minnie) round out the titular eight some more hateful than the rest. Tarantino whose earliest pictures - Reservoir Dogs Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown - crackled with wiseguy dialogue and cool digressions into pop-cult spheres clearly thinks his wordsmithing is without equal and without need of editing. And so these actors and the ones joining them at the halfway mark (Zoe Bell and Channing Tatum among em) embark on long soliloquies less meaningful than mundane full of anachronistic argot arch jabber and cowpoke exclamations such as ""Ill be double-dog damned."" The N-word which Tarantino deployed with button-pushing profligacy in 2012s slavery western Django Unchained is all over The Hateful Eight too. With its crusty Civil War veterans staring each other down across the long wooden planks of Minnies way station race and racial loathing seem like legitimate issues to explore. But whether its Jackson or Dern or Leigh spittin out the ethnic slur it leaves a decidedly bad taste - gratuitous gimmicky and ultimately beside the point. That is because - despite its attention-grabbing format and daunting running time (and despite the extracurricular publicity Tarantino has generated by speaking out against police violence) - there is no point to The Hateful Eight at all. sreaphillynews.com 215-854-5629 Steven_Rea www.philly.com/onmovies The Hateful Eight  (Out of four stars) Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.

And no ones creative motor runs hotter than the man whose eighth feature aims to up the ante on his own previous magnificent seven. Tarantino always swings for the fences. He doesnt connect with every wild pitch thrown here. At three hours this Western whodunit can feel like too much of a good thing. But Tarantino writes like a flamethrower. His incendiary dialogue feels like profane poetry. And the dude thinks big. The Hateful Eight is available in select theaters in large-format 70mm with an overture from the films iconic composer Ennio Morricone and an intermission that lets haters get riled up about gore misogyny the n-word and the usual bugaboos that make Tarantino a target. Hang on. Even if you think The Hateful Eight is something swung at and missed you never doubt the cunning and commitment of the wiz behind the curtain. More News Watch Bloody New Trailer for Tarantinos Hateful Eight 10 Best Movies of 2015 Quentin Tarantino The Madman of Movie Mayhem Pulp Fiction A to Z All Stories >> Related 2015 The Year in Tarantino Controversies The Hateful Eight filmmakers year in quotes from pissing off the police to taking on Disney Set during a Wyoming blizzard at a frontier way station the film -- shot with a poets eye by the great Robert Richardson -- tricks us right from the start. After an opening thats as big as the great outdoors the film moves inside by the fire and pretty much stays put like a stage production that favors character over action. The much-vaunted 70mm format used on such epics as the Sixties version of Ben-Hur becomes Tarantinos means to examine every flicker of the human face. And what faces The Hateful Eight is crammed with villains. Forget good everyone here is just bad and ugly. Samuel L. Jackson the best interpreter anywhere of Tarantinos street Shakespeare is a sparking livewire as Maj. Marquis Warren an ex-Union soldier still battling racial tensions nearly a decade after the Civil War. The man who gives the stranded ""black fella"" a lift on his stagecoach is wild whiskered John Ruth (a stellar Kurt Russell) a bounty hunter cuffed to one Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason-Leigh) a prisoner hes taking into Red Rock for hanging. From the looks of Daisys black eye Ruth is not above taking a hand or worse to a woman. But what with the blizzard brewing the coach passengers stop at Minnies haberdashery to ride out the storm. Theyve got company a motley group of perps. A terrific Walton Goggins plays Chris Mannix a Johnny Reb who claims to be Red Rocks new shertiff. Tim Roth plays a British hangman wonderfully named Oswaldo Mobray and hes joined by another Reservoir Dog Michael Madsen as suspicious cowboy Joe Cage. Theres also Bob (Demian Bichir) a Mexican who contends that hes a pal of the absent Minnie and Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern) a Confederate general who doesnt like the look of Jacksons Major one damn bit. All the actors kick ass especially Leigh who is sensational and then some as a battered woman with an agenda. Its a tour de force performance that keeps springing surprises. So stay alert for this deliciously depraved nest of eight vipers right out of Agatha Christies And Then There Were None if Dame Agatha had converted to pulp fiction. Coffee is poisoned bullets are fired blood is splattered bodies pile up and a letter from Abe Lincoln is read. Okay maybe it doesnt all add up. Screw coherence. Dig in for the fireworks and a whole lot of crazy. Then wait for the rug to get pulled out from under you. If you know your Tarantino you also know there will be tricks of time and unanticipated visitors blown in by a raging tempest that recalls one of Tarantinos favored horrorshows John Carpenters The Thing. Still its the tempest of hilarious and horrific talk that rivets our attention. Since nearly everyone hurls the word ""nigger"" at the Major he retaliates in a monologue that lets Tarantino make wicked fun of the white mans fear of the black dick. Its a given that some audiences wont find this a hoot or cotton to the beatings Daisy suffers at the hands of brutal men. Tarantino is a lot of things but politically correct isnt one of them. Safe doesnt interest him. He brings the war home baby with all the political geographical social sexual and racial implications were still wrangling with today. Watch out for Tarantinos seething subtext in The Hateful Eight -- itll nag at your conscience and no way will it let go. Topics Samuel L.

Three-hour blockbusters - musicals and biblical epics mostly -- played special reserved-seat big-city engagements. They had recorded overtures intermissions and souvenir programs sold in the lobby. I didnt see any booklets at my own recent screening of ""The Hateful Eight"" but otherwise Quentin Tarantino recreates the experience perfectly - even to the extent of filming the movie in widescreen 70mm. For the king of film-culture kitsch its a bit of sweet nostalgia - although frankly more than slightly self-indulgent as theres little in ""The Hateful Eight"" that absolutely requires this kind of visual treatment. After a solid first reel of snowy vistas the action switches to a single large room. There are no epic chariot races no musical numbers with hundreds of extras. Its actually a rather small-screen story (literally - as critic Joe Leydon first pointed out the bare bones of the plot copy without credit an episode of that old TV show ""The Rebel""). And yet those small problems acknowledged its still one of my favorite Tarantino movies since ""Jackie Brown."" He may not like that. ""All you critics like Jackie Brown"" he told me once in a kind of exasperation - the unsaid complaint being Why didnt we like ""Inglorious Basterds"" or ""Kill Bill"" as much films that really bore his stamp? But my reason was simple. ""Jackie Brown"" wasnt about other movies. It was about people. And it kept its storys focus on its people without digressions sideshows dead-end subplots or little bragging moments that proved just how many other films its director had seen. ""The Hateful Eight"" may have its little in-jokes right down to an onscreen title which informs us its the directors eighth film (which isnt quite true unless you count the two-part ""Kill Bill"" as one movie and forget about Tarantinos contributions to ""Four Rooms"" and ""Sin City""). But despite those gags Tarantino is deadly serious. The tale starts with bounty hunter John Ruth bringing prisoner Daisy Domergue to justice in Red Rock Wyo. A blizzard is coming and along the way Ruth reluctantly picks up another bounty hunter Marquis Warren and Red Rocks newly minted sheriff Chris Mannix. The storm worsens and they take refuge in a stagecoach stop where theyre met by a worker and some other travelers - a retired Confederate general a cowhand a traveling hangman. But is that who these people really are or just who they pretend to be? The questions academic - until folks start showing up dead. Tarantino has always written quirky characters and colorful dialogue but what makes him a terrific screenwriter is that the characters have an internal logic and the dialogue doesnt all sound the same. Ruth and Warren are both bounty hunters but Ruth has a code of honor and Warren has a plan for survival and those are different things. The general and the hangman are both gentlemen but their manners differ depending on the lands of their birth; the general and the sheriff are both Southerners but the social gap separating them is wider than the Mississippi. Theyre great characters which is why they give rise to some great performances - particularly Kurt Russell as the stalwart Ruth and Samuel L. Jackson as the clever Warren. Russell has always been a great masculine presence and by now hes able to embody the kind of John Wayne swagger he used to burlesque in films like ""Big Trouble in Little China."" And Jacksons sly unreadable character says everything about being a black man in a white world that Tarantino merely thought he was saying in ""Django Unchained."" The other actors dont delight quite so much. Damien Bicher squints one eye throughout like a south-of-the-border Popeye Jennifer Jason Leigh seems to be channeling Amanda Plummer and I will never understand some critics love for Walton Goggins - who if he were any hammier could season an entire winters worth of split-pea soup. But Jackson and Russell more than carry the film and helping keep things interesting is that were never sure who the real stars of the film are. Some characters show up late in the action or disappear halfway through. Others become far more pivotal than we imagined. Its a mystery as much as a Western although Tarantino plays fair with us throughout. That doesnt mean he doesnt have fun though with a few lines of narration or with some gorgeous style. Its toned down a bit here - again he no longer seems to feel compelled to quote from other movies or play dj (apart from a few pop songs the score is original and from movie-music great Ennio Morricone). And thats a relief. Robert Richardsons camerawork begins the movie with wintry vistas and startling white-on-white horizons and once inside the stagecoach stop he and Tarantino use a shallow depth of focus to continually suggest things going on in the background were not privy to. And despite all this (very good) dialogue there are several moments of explosive old-style Tarantino action. Too explosive Id say - at one point blood is gushing like oil wells and twice we get to see heads blown to bits in closeup. Of course Tarantino has always had an unquenchable love for exploitation movies but the Grand Guignol seems out-of place here. (Also jarring is the constant physical abuse visited upon the female prisoner -- or more particularly the fact that its played for laughs.) But without all of that - the problematic taste as well as the striking photography the love of trashy exploitation and the feel for full-blooded dialogue - it wouldnt be a Tarantino movie. And ""The Hateful Eight"" is the best Tarantino movie in a long time - whether he quite wants to hear that or not. Ratings note The film contains graphic and gory violence strong and racist language and sexual situations. The Hateful Eight (R) Weinstein (187 min.) Directed by Quentin Tarantino. With Kurt Russell Jennifer Jason Leigh Samuel L. Jackson. Now opens Friday in New Jersey.    1/2 Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com. Follow him on Twitter stephenwhitty.

(Andrew Cooper) Joe Dziemianowicz NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday December 22 2015 400 AM Title The Hateful Eight Film Info With Samuel L. Jackson Jennifer Jason Leigh and Kurt Russell. Bounty hunters seek shelter during a blizzard but find themselves in a trap. Director Quentin Tarantino (307). Rated R for violence and language. Area theaters. Toss a classic Western a Miss Marple mystery and gobs of gore into a big-screen crockpot and you get Quentin Tarantinos weird wild and way-too-long new movie ""The Hateful Eight."" Set en-route to and inside a snowed-in cabin in Wyoming a few years after the Civil War the film is a visual stunner packed with majestic landscapes and moody close-ups that make the best use of the old-style 70 mm format. Tarantino indulges himself too offering an old-school overture by Ennio Morricone and an intermission. Curveballs in the script poetry profanity and demented violence are trademark Tarantino. And the terrific ensemble including some of the filmmakers go-to players is served up expertly. Despite those pluses the simple story about frontier justice and family ties feels stretched out and too thin to support the weight and sprawl of a 3-hour-plus running time that turns the tale into ""The Indulgent 180."" As a result the heady buzz brought forth in earlier Tarantino works like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Django Unchained"" is missing in action. Thats no fault of the stars. Samuel L. Jackson is in top eloquent form as a bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren who hitches a ride with another bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his fugitive Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whos to be hanged in Red Rock. Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) who claims to be Red Rocks new sheriff also climbs aboard. A blizzard forces them to seek refuge at a mountain stopover. Michael Madsen Kurt Russell and Jennifer Jason Leigh star in ""The Hateful Eight"" the new film by Quentin Tarantino. (The Weinstein Company) Thats where they collide with Bob (Demian Bichir) who says hes minding the place for the absentee owner; Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) a local hangman; cowboy Joe (Michael Madsen); and Confederate Gen. Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern). The claustrophobic one-room setting is the stuff that tension is made of. Factor in racial hatred and hammers guns and knives and the air gets so thick you can cut it with a cleaver. Eventually Warren like an Agatha Christie crime-solver lays out his theory of whats really going on. By that time coffee has been poisoned and in short order Channing Tatums outlaw shows up -- along with a bloodbath. You wonder who if anyone will make it out alive -- or if the film will ever be over. ""The name of the game is patience"" declares one cold-blooded killer. But thats Tarantino talking. Despite his films many virtues he tests ours.

Film Review A new Tarantino classic is born in pulsating Western The Hateful Eight Entertainment by Lindsey Bahr The Associated Press Posted Dec 21 2015 219 pm EDT Last Updated Dec 21 2015 at 320 pm EDT This image released by The Weinstein Company shows Kurt Russell in a scene from ""The Hateful Eight."" (Andrew Cooper/The Weinstein Company via AP) ""The Hateful Eight"" is not for the faint at heart. What Quentin Tarantino movie is? But while cinemas favourite cinephile is up to some of his old tricks in his eighth feature this over three hour long drawing room thriller also feels like a step forward for the wayward enfant terrible -- a step toward maturity. Thats not to say hes mellowed. You need only spend a minute with 87-year-old Ennio Morricones throbbing malicious score to know that to be true. Instead Tarantino shows relaxed power with ""The Hateful Eight."" Its easy authority thats less manic than the cinematic language weve grown to expect from him. And it still packs a punch to the gut or in the spirit of Jennifer Jason Leighs murderous prisoner some repeated blows to the head. This tale of eight unsavoury creatures stranded in a one-room haberdashery in the middle of a nasty Wyoming blizzard is in no hurry to get where its going and the audience is better off for it. Its a whodunit when no one has done anything yet -- more like a whos gonna do it and what exactly are they gonna do. Everyone is bad everyone has a secret and everyone is the hero of their own story. Theres Samuel L. Jackson as the hyper literate bounty hunter Major Marquis Warren who carries a personal letter from Abraham Lincoln in his coat pocket; Kurt Russell as the violently affable John Ruth whos transporting a prisoner to town to be hanged for a 10000 bounty; Leigh as said prisoner; Daisy Domergue whose bloody Cheshire grin says more than any monologue ever could. Walton Goggins plays Chris Mannix the soon-to-be sheriff who may be a master manipulator or just plain dumb; Demian Bechir is Bob who runs the Haberdashery; Michael Madsen as Joe Gage the menacingly quiet one in the corner; Tim Roth as Oswaldo Mobray a British hangman who seems like a Christoph Waltz stand-in before he finds his groove; and Bruce Dern as an ornery Confederate general wondering whats become of his life now that the war is done. It seems like a lot but its really not. Thats the brilliance of Tarantino. Each of his characters is so distinctive so rich that they pop off the screen as soon as you meet them. It is refreshing when so many ensemble movies seem to confuse character development with something more akin to ""heres a famous person who youll remember."" Vivid costuming work from Courtney Hoffman only adds to their uniqueness. Tarantino also keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering who to trust or at the very least side with. It changes every 15 minutes as the mystery unravels and then explodes. The conversations are as nimble as ever whether theyre talking coffee war or the benefits of transporting prisoners dead or alive. A big deal has been made about the presentation of ""The Hateful Eight."" Tarantino and his cinematographer Robert Richardson shot the film in Ultra Panavision 70 a basically dead format that was used on only a few films such as ""Mutiny on the Bounty."" Theres even an overture and an intermission at the roadshow presentations. Its hard to see how thats not mostly posturing as most of the film is set in one room but it does add a theatrical wonder to it all even if the ""glorious 70mm"" depends a great deal on the individual projectionist. In the screening I attended the film was so blurry that they switched to digital at intermission. For what its worth the digital looked great. Besides we need Tarantino to go all out in whatever ways he deems necessary even if we dont always understand it. If he didnt he wouldnt be Tarantino and wed be missing out. ""The Hateful Eight"" a Weinstein Company release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""strong bloody violence a scene of violent sexual content language and some graphic nudity."" Wide release run time 167 minutes. 70mm Roadshow Run Time 187 minutes with a 12 minute intermission. Three and a half stars out of four. ___ MPAA Definition of R Restricted.

""The Hateful Eight"" which was filmed partially around Telluride (standing in for Wyoming) is set ""six or eight or 12 years after the Civil War"" an ambiguity meant to reinforce the the slippery rule of law in the Western territories of the time. This stark but thematically rich movie plays with Western stock characters in satisfying ways. Its also a violent chamber mystery and as is the case with all of Tarantinos work an homage to 70s genre-cinema updated with clever dialogue humor and moral ellipses. The film which was shot in the revived Ultra Panavision 70mm film format opens on an icy expanse of mountain landscape dwarfing a tiny stagecoach. The gorgeous vistas are in no way comforting; this may as well be the moon. John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and fugitive Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) are on their way to Red Rock Wyo. where Ruths ""Hangman"" is looking to cash in on his bounty. Former union solider Maj. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) stops them in the road and convinces them to give him a ride followed by another unexpected guest Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins in a beautifully calibrated performance) who claims hes Red Rocks new sheriff. An encroaching blizzard forces the odd-quartet (plus their dutiful driver) to divert to Minnies Haberdashery a sundries stopover located in a dim cavernous log cabin. There they stumble across curious guests supposed caretaker Bob (Demian Bichir) the upbeat Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth who identifies himself as Red Rocks hangman) quiet black-hat cowboy Joe Gage (an excellent Michael Madsen) and Confederate general Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern). Instant mistrust rampant racism (reinforced with a barrage of N-words) and conflicting loyalties -- mostly to ones self -- play out amid delicious tension as cabin fever grips the group. Juggling this many players is a mighty task. Tarantinos winding script establishes their roles in fits and starts never putting too much pressure on any one scene or piece of dialogue. Jackson and Jason Leigh dominate every frame theyre in but everyone gets a chance to shine. Russells performance echoes John Wayne in its gruff surety and accent. ""Keeping you at a disadvantage is an advantage I intend to keep"" he blurts at one point spelling out the whole of his interactions in the film. Two of Tarantinos clutch players -- Roth and Madsen -- prove vital to the mood casually dropping red herrings as their characters try to outdo each others polar personalities (Roth the fussy Brit Madsen the grizzled frontiersman). Tarantinos trademark blasts of ultra-violence leave their intended mark. But the finer details -- a trembling shaft of dust and snow in the cramped stagecoach snowshoes criss-crossed to look like angel wings behind a character -- hit quieter more beautiful notes. The choice of viewing format bears directly on picture quality as Tarantino intended. The films Dec. 24-Dec. 31 ""roadshow"" screenings in 70mm which have proven expensive and complicated thus far will be the first choice of cinephiles. When this reviewer watched the film it was from a digital projector which is how most people will see it beginning Dec. 31. The images were still gorgeously toned and crisp with appropriately inky margins and plenty of room for eyes to roam. The stunning vistas and tiny details cinematographer Bob Richardson has baked into ""The Hateful Eight"" may not get full rendering in every theater but theyre there. The 70mm roadshow version is 187 minutes including a 12-minute intermission. The wide-release film is only a bit shorter and likely no less impactful or deliberate. Like all Tarantino films ""Hateful"" reinterprets the familiar in surprising ways. Songs by the White Stripes and Roy Orbison bookend spaghetti western legend Ennio Morricones mournful spare score. The constant use of racist and misogynistic language the obsession with guns and the devotion to hopeless causes is unquestionably rooted in contemporary anxieties. But like Tarantinos best work the film forces you to see and feel something on its own terms -- in this case loyalty and identity unraveling under extremes. Nothing turns out well of course. But watching it fall apart in shocking funny artful ways has always been the point.

Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer ""The Hateful Eight"" opens in Seattle late Thursday Dec. 24. So Quentin Tarantino decided to go all whole-hog with ""The Hateful Eight."" Opens with an overture. Interrupts with an intermission. Stretches the whole thing out to three hours-plus. Sa-a-ay just who does he think he is? David Lean? Movie Review     The Hateful Eight with Samuel L. Jackson Kurt Russell Jennifer Jason Leigh Walton Goggins Tim Roth. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. 187 minutes in 70mm roadshow format with 12-minute intermission; 167 minutes everywhere else. Rated R for strong bloody violence a scene of violent sexual content language and some graphic nudity. Several theaters. Nah. Sergio Leone is his polestar for this one.

Its Samuel L. Jackson in the lead role of Maj. Marquis Warren looking like the second coming of Lee Van Cleef. Same flat-brim black hat. Same curved-stem pipe. Similar gunfighter glare. And hear that? Its Ennio Morricone providing the music. You just know that the worlds most famous former video-store clerk has watched ""For a Few Dollars More"" and ""The Good the Bad and the Ugly"" a time or two ... thousand. Like Van Cleefs Leoni characters Warren is a bounty hunter. The time is after the Civil War and Warren a battle-hardened Union veteran is hitching a ride in a blizzard on a stagecoach. Aboard is another bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell elaborately mustached) chained to his prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh outfitted with rotted teeth and a major black eye) whom Ruth is taking to the town of Red Rock to be hanged. The coach stops to pick up another hitchhiker Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) a Confederate army vet and the conversation quickly turns to race relations in the no longer dis-United States. It goes something like this ""Blah blah blah N-word blah blah N-word blah N-word N-word."" Etc. Tarantino has had a long and problematic history of the use of that word extending all the way back to ""Pulp Fiction."" It reached its apogee until now in ""Django Unchained."" Its use and overuse is Tarantinos way of proving what a non-PC bad boy he is. The historic context of ""Django"" and ""Hateful"" explains its use and the fact that those who utter it end up killed I suppose is intended to excuse it. After a long stagecoach journey (tip of the cowboy hat to John Ford there) all arrive at a snowbound mountain cabin occupied by a group of scroungy characters with questionable intentions. Whereupon ""blah blah blah N-word N-word blah"" and who slipped poison in the coffee? About an hour into the mission it occurs to you No ones been shot yet. You wonder ""Hey what kind of Tarantino movie is this anyway? Wheres the bloodbath?"" Patience Grasshopper. Just you wait until after the intermission. ""Blah N -- BANG -- word."" BANG BANG BANG Blood like a river flows. Yep were in Tarantino territory for sure way too self-indulgently long and way way overboard with that N-word.

No matter how Quentin Tarantino arms his characters--with katana swords (Kill Bill) shotguns (Pulp Fiction) or baseball bats (Inglourious Basterds)--their chief weapons are words. Thats just how this writer-director rolls and even as The Hateful Eight starts off in the wintry Colorado trappings of a post-Civil War Western were soon essentially in a series of rooms a chatty stagecoach then Minnies Haberdashery a drafty outpost where spit flies into gloriously rude arguments. Tarantinos most appealingly claustrophobic film since Reservoir Dogs has a parlor-whodunit theatrical intimacy to it. Theres zero need for it to have been shot in sumptuous 70 millimeter--lets call that the gimmick it is and move on to the tart talkers hes assembled for our amusement. Bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell summoning his A-grade John Wayne drawl from Big Trouble in Little China) escorts a wild-eyed prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh doing wonders with little) to the gallows and his huge payday. But a fearsome blizzard approaches and after Ruth allows old war acquaintance Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) and ex-Confederate sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) to ride along to the relative safety of a remote outpost theres a strong hint that an escape plan is afoot. Before unleashing its violent wallop of a second half The Hateful Eight simmers along like the pots of coffee constantly being brewed onscreen. Composer Ennio Morricones seesawing score--his first new Western work in decades--sometimes brings to mind Tarantino fave Sergio Leone but the real ancestor here is John Carpenters 1982 The Thing another thriller percolating with close-quarters paranoia and Hawksian gab. It doesnt quite work altogether High-minded conversational detours into racial injustice feel a little too on the nose (as do the periodic unnecessary punches to Leighs bloodied face). But its as pure an expression of Tarantinos voice as hes ever mustered--easy to savor even if the aftertaste leaves a trace of nasty bitterness.

The Hateful Eight his intimate suspenseful western splatter-horror comedy has been shot at great expense in the long-gone 70mm format but the movie itself is set almost entirely in cramped interiors. Hes hired Ennio Morricone to score the thing but dont expect rousing new western themes -- the music is tense and looping tinkling with chimes. And the first time a white character has a chance to speak that slur that is to Tarantino movies what ""breakin my balls"" is to Scorseses that white guy -- a walrus-mustached bounty hunter embodied by Kurt Russell -- politely opts for ""black fella"" instead.Tarantino seems determined to upend your every expectation. Heres an engaging drawing-room outlaw mystery that devotes much of its generous running time to what my aunt calls ""visiting."" Heres an octet of gun-toting bastards sitting out a blizzard and striving for decorousness despite detesting one another on grounds of race region and politics. In that way its an honest movie about America during the holidays.Film Details The Hateful Eight RatingR GenreWestern Running Time167 min. More Info But dont think Tarantino is changing on us. Soon everyone is expectorating ""nigger"" at each other and after several reels of diverting 1870s tough-guy dialogue comedy with bounty hunters of uncertain allegiance holed up in a Wyoming frontier way station the movie twists into nastiness beyond anything you might anticipate.There are new elements Samuel L. Jackson aces some Miss Marple sleuth work and theres a moving ballad sung by Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays a high-bounty prisoner chained to Russell. But the writer-directors hallmarks abound. Here again are chatty killers and the pretzeled-history pleasure of seeing minorities kaboom the brains of their oppressors. As in Django Unchained Tarantino invests his attention in snowy vistas rafters and floorboards whiskers and stagecoaches risible anachronisms and speech after speech some sleepy but many cruel marvels.Related StoriesQuentin Tarantino Is About to Drop His Most Unconventional Film in DecadesBut this isnt Django II. This is Tarantinos smallest-scaled effort since Reservoir Dogs his first film since then that could easily work on the stage. It has a traditional plays pacing and structure with the power forever shifting among its principals and with members of the ensemble left to sit there looking on while the others have their big scenes. Its a slow-burn of a movie one that tracks in real time how long it takes coffee to brew.The Hateful Eight also marks the end of its authors run of heroic fantasies Unlike in Kill Bill and Inglourious Basterds you wont feel pressured to cheer the inevitable deaths. The slapstick butchery of the final reels is plenty nasty of course and satisfying in its sick pointlessness. Its unshackled from that queasy Django/Basterds sense that were meant to believe that over-the-top movie violence might right history. Too many people buy that already so its a relief that this bloodbath is ugly and contained a well-shot bad-luck circle-jerk. The films chatty ingratiating and then howlingly mean.But all those familiar Tarantino elements are side dishes arranged around a main course that might gag in audiences throats. The centerpiece is a taboo-flouting monologue from Samuel L. Jackson that stands as Tarantinos most lurid and sustained expression of one of his great preoccupations the reputed sexual might of black men.In his recent films Tarantino has worked the idea of the black penis as the white whale of Johnny Reb types They fear it admire it and ache to bring one down. Witness Walton Goggins prepping to geld Jamie Foxx in Django awed before Gods handiwork. Now in The Hateful Eight Tarantino goes further still writing Jackson a disquisition on the subject that builds like a profane aria. Imagining the Oscar telecast trying to excerpt it is reason enough to hope for a nomination for Jackson who is terrifying and hilarious here with material that dares the audience to walk out.Jokes on them though. By that point the movies been on so long nobody can get their money back.Jackson also talks some of that ol black-dick magic in Chi-Raq. That should throw some heat off Tarantino -- at least from the left. The right though will howl because as always in his historical fantasies Tarantino presents our ancestors as pitiably small-minded on the subject of race.The script isnt always so shrewdly measured on these matters but in all its shock-talk The Hateful Eight airs a couple of painful truths about race in America dialogue thats a lifetime removed from the glib use of ""nigger"" in Pulp Fiction. Early on Goggins playing a sing-songy Rebel raider snaps this bald statement of purpose at Jacksons Confederate-killing bounty hunter ""When niggers are scared thats when white folks are safe."" Nobody points out the irony that in that statement its white folks who are scared. Even more surprising is that after all that The Hateful Eight turns like Django on an affecting cross-racial friendship. Jackson and Russell dominate the picture -- Jackson slyly his character putting together clues before its clear that theres a mystery and Russell brusquely swinging his way around the way station John Wayne-style. Leigh is handcuffed to Russell; her Daisy Domergue is an outlaw Russells John Ruth has captured. For most of the film shes his silent shadow a black-eyed joker in the margins. (Tarantino seems to find the sight of her getting cold-cocked in the face funnier than you might.)Eventually Leigh her face covered in gore seizes The Hateful Eight and makes it her own. Her Domergue wheezes a lot like Leonardo DiCaprios fur trapper in The Revenant a luckless fellow who shares her glee for catching snowflakes on the tongue. To say more about Leighs haunting demented turn would involve spoiling Tarantinos plotting so lets leave it at this Shes the most compelling monster in a film teeming with them.

Share Tweet Stubbornly theatrical Quentin Tarantinos three-hour snowed-in Western The Hateful Eight is a difficult movie by a director whos not known for making them. Slow in the early going it withholds almost all overt action until just before the intermission at which point it explodes into the meanest most gruesome and nihilistic violence of Tarantinos career only to conclude on a disquieting note of hope. Shot in 70mm but largely set in one room this is the writer-directors take on the betrayed promise of America a perverse vision of sadistic men comforted by false causes. The American ideal was only ever a lie says The Hateful Eight but in the end when the floorboards are slicked with blood and brain matter and the fatally wounded have enacted a ritualistic parody of justice it looks toward that same ideal with the hope that one day someone will be suckered by it hard enough to make it come true. Who could have predicted that Quentin Tarantino director of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction would eventually turn into a political filmmaker? The Hateful Eight stakes territory previously worked by Sam Peckinpah and the more politically conscious of the spaghetti Westerns but it owes just as much to John Carpenters The Thing with which it shares a star a composer and a whole lot more. The claustrophobic set-up--seven bad men and a feral woman trapped in a Wyoming roadhouse--brings out the worst in an ugly bunch and it comes out at first in slurs and pointed fingers and then in sprays of bloody vomit and gunshots that blow heads and nutsacks clean off. But even if a lot of it is played for laughs this is still the first Tarantino movie that might be called a drama. Set to an orchestral score (Ennio Morricone no less) with a script that could easily be a stage play The Hateful Eight is about as close as this pastiche artist is likely to get to the classical tradition its storys crisscross of opposites and suspicions cut through by some of his most lucid and sophisticated camerawork. One long take turns the sharpness of 70mm on its ear with the point of focus hopscotching from foreground to background on perfect cue.First conceived as a sequel to Django Unchained Tarantinos third consecutive re-working of Western tropes isnt a historical fantasy in the vein of its predecessor or Inglourious Basterds though it similarly paints the past in terms of misdeeds i.e. revenge potential. Though hes characterized as a fetishist who makes movie-movies most of Tarantinos reference points and influences (blaxploitation films revisionist Westerns New Wave-era Jean-Luc Godard movies etc.) are very political; given the lengths hes gone to imitate their sense of cool perhaps it was inevitable that hed develop a political conscience. Here there is talk of violence in law enforcement and the only black man among the eight speaks at length about being seen as a threat. Tarantino still cant resist a signifying reference (in The Hateful Eight characters are named after underrated directors lesser B-movie starlets and John Ford bit players) but theyre no longer the main draw. It used to be that when an American director had something to say about fundamental values they went and made a Western and making Westerns is just about all Tarantino has been doing as of late. So what does Tarantino have to say if anything? The Hateful Eight is a drawing-room mystery translated to the barroom set some years after the Civil War at a stagecoach stop called Minnies Haberdashery where a group of stock Western types are waiting out a snowstorm. Arriving on the Butterfield Overland Stage bounty hunters John Ruth (Kurt Russell doing a very committed impression of John Wayne) and Col. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) suspect right away that theyve walked into some kind of set-up but cant figure out whos in on it. Ruth semi-ironically nicknamed ""the Hangman"" for always bringing in bounties alive is a mountain man who folds out dainty glasses to read. In this film hes what passes for moral bedrock despite his habit of smacking around Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) the murderer hes bringing in for a big payday in nearby Red Rock. Warren introduced seated atop three frozen corpses is a Union Army veteran reputedly in possession of a personal letter from Abraham Lincoln. He is a man capable of deep cruelty and the closest thing The Hateful Eight has to a protagonist.Because its composed in large part of extended cussed-up rhetorical dialogues The Hateful Eight arranges its characters in a complicated web of counterpoints with every character being some kind of contrast to each of the others. So Ruth ""the Hangman"" reminiscent of rugged late Western heroes is contrasted with an Englishman (Tim Roth reunited with Tarantino after 20 years) who says hes an actual hangman and a stranger (Michael Madsen black hair dye done no favors by 70mm) who looks like he just waltzed in from a singing cowboy picture and with Warren who prefers his bounties dead for ease of transport--and so on and so forth. With the exception of Ruth and the stagecoach driver everybody in The Hateful Eight has some kind of secret that theyre hiding some part of their back story that doesnt check out and some reason to hate all the other characters. At one point the Englishman called Mobray proposes they divide the room between Union men and ex-Confederates to prevent further arguing. But by then its obvious that whats been gathered at Minnies is the worst of American animosity forced by bad weather into dialogue with itself.All this talk of rhetoric and counterpoints may give the impression that The Hateful Eight is three hours of dialectics but if Tarantino were making movies only for the political points this one wouldnt be a third as long. The Hateful Eight is an exercise in the art of the protracted scene which has been part of his personal signature since Reservoir Dogs--the exchange initiated in an off-hand way that gets tenser and funnier because it keeps going on and on and on in unpredictable turns. Whether its the 15-minute basement bar game in Inglourious Basterds or the dinner at Candyland in Django Unchained the best recent examples have had overtones of theater either because they play with theatrical themes (e.g. performance with characters play-acting) or because they use exits entrances and props in ways that are pretty damn theatrical. (Djangos dinner prominently features a skull the most famous prop in English theater.) The Hateful Eight draws out tension as though it were very slowly pulling back the plunger on a syringe and then injects it back in one stabbing motion jolting itself into a hyperactive state; once the guns come out so do the flashbacks voice-over narration (read by the director himself) and shifts in point-of-view. The drawing out it does by taking the long way through every scene which is sometimes the funniest way--especially if said scene involves Demian Bichirs stiff-limbed Bob a comic-strip creation on par with Brad Pitts Aldo Raine--but never the easiest. Which is to say Who would have thought that Tarantino whose early hits spawned dozens of over-caffeinated imitators would make a movie that would ask for so much patience? Because patience is what it takes for Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins)--a yokel whos always going on about the Lost Cause and says hes the new sheriff in Red Rock but cant prove it--to go from being a caricature to a complicated character in his own right. At the center of this long deliberate movie sits the complex figure of Warren the bounty hunter who was once himself a wanted man and the image of Lincoln whose death at the hands of John Wilkes Booth is spoken of as though it were Biblical. For the eight snowed in with their prejudices and their paranoia and their itchy trigger fingers venerating Honest Abe expresses a belief in something better than themselves regardless of which side of the Civil War they fought on. (Heck even Birth Of A Nation worshipped Lincoln.) And in a finale reminiscent of Pulp Fictions enigmatic endpoint when the ugly American past and present theyve given voice to has degraded and de-evolved into a caveman instinct of violence and retribution the remaining characters gather to marvel at what a beautiful idea America could be--one of the few really moving scenes in Tarantinos highly stylized body of work.

Jackson; Director Quentin Tarantino; Release Date Wide 01/01/2016; Runtime (in minutes) 187; MPAA Rating R Posted December 15 2015 -- 507 PM EST Quentin Tarantinos great gift as an artist is the way hes able to quote cinemas past while saying something new. He can take a stroll down memory lane without buying a house there. In his new film the slow-simmering Western The Hateful Eight he sets out on a classic adventure right out of John Fords Stagecoach and ends up in the caffeinated chaos that closed Reservoir Dogs. Whether you want to go with him on that long journey is a different matter. As someone whos loved almost all of Tarantinos films I felt--for the first time--something close to disappointment. At their best his films give off the giddy sensation of too much--that he has so many inspired ideas vibrating in his celluloid brain that he overwhelms us. But The Hateful Eight doesnt have enough ideas. Set almost entirely in a snowed-in saloon the storys so spare it doesnt warrant either its three-hour running time (including an overture and intermission) or his use of 70mm projection. Its narratively and visually claustrophobic. Fortunately the directors genius for casting hasnt abandoned him. Kurt Russell has a blast chewing on Tarantinos florid dialogue as a grizzled bounty hunter Jennifer Jason Leigh shines through a bloody smile as the outlaw hes taking to the hangman and Samuel L. Jackson is at his ripsnorting Jacksoniest as a surly Union officer. Bruce Dern Tim Roth Michael Madsen Walton Goggins and Demian Bichir round out the odious octet sniffing one another like dogs in a cage. While genre fans will dig Tarantinos nods to whiteout spaghetti Westerns like The Great Silence (a connection goosed by Ennio Morricones sublime red-sauce score) others will be left wondering if thats all there is. In this case the answer sadly is yes.

Kurt Russell Eyed to Play Chris Pratts Dad in Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (Exclusive) Dont let the Ultra Panavision 70 fool you This locked-room mystery takes place almost entirely in stagecoaches and cabins but its fun if you like QT at his talkiest Theres something of an art prank going on with ""The Hateful Eight"" which is as the opening credits portentously point out ""the eighth feature by Quentin Tarantino."" The writer-director has in recent years become a vocal champion of film projection over digital and much has been made about his choice not only to shoot the film in the rarely-used Ultra Panavision 70 format but also to release ""Hateful"" in the ""roadshow"" format of yore complete with overture and intermission. Celebrating the cinema of the past has always been Tarantinos forte although hes usually been more inclined to rejoice in the seamier side of the moviegoing experience (down to the scratches and cuts he inserted into the anthology film ""Grindhouse"") rather than the sort of grandiosity used to ballyhoo the elephantine musicals and epics of the 1960s. See Photo Where Is Channing Tatum in New Hateful Eight Trailer? The prank part has to do with the movie thats being offered up in such extravagant trappings -- when you think of Tarantino shooting a Western in 70mm you picture sweeping shots of cowboys and cattle stampeding across big sky country rather than the rather intimate chamber piece hes made here. The gap between material and presentation resembles a 3-D IMAX reissue of ""My Dinner with Andre."" Theres plenty of bloodshed and mayhem on display to be sure and Tarantino still revels in pushing buttons when it comes to depicting and discussing race in this country but ""The Hateful Eight"" owes less to Sergio Leone than it does to Agatha Christie. If youre the kind of moviegoer who got restless during the more dialogue-heavy sequences of ""Death Proof"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"" you may find that theres too much talk and not enough action in a movie that teeters on the three-hour mark. Also Read The Hateful Eight Wide Release Moves Up a Week to New Years Day If on the other hand you enjoy a Tarantino-scripted conversation or two or five -- particularly in a period piece where the characters cant make references to movies or TV shows -- ""The Hateful Eight"" may well engage you as a darkly funny locked-door mystery thats in no hurry to show its hand. We begin in the great outdoors when a stagecoach containing bounty hunter John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his quarry wanted criminal Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) stops to engage with Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) a peer of Ruths whos got two corpses of his own that hes taking to town for a reward. After some haggling Ruth offers Warren and his baggage transport to the town of Red Rock. Soon thereafter the travelers come upon Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) whos heading toward the same destination to become the towns new sheriff -- or so he says. In the meantime a huge storm is brewing so the party must stay the night at an infamous roadhouse known as Minnies Haberdashery. When they arrive Minnie is nowhere to be found but she appears to have left Bob (Demian Bichir) in charge and hes already taking care of a fairly full house including hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) cowpoke Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) and retired Confederate general Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern). Also Read SAG Awards Message to Hollywood Dont Procrastinate The Civil War is still a recent and touchy subject for the group what with Warren having fought on the Union side -- and its rumored having killed many white soldiers on both sides -- while Mannix was part of a CSA splinter army. But political differences are pushed aside when it becomes clear that not everyone is who they appear to be and that there may be a conspiracy afoot to liberate Daisy from the clutches of the law. The results are more ""Clue"" than ""The Magnificent Seven"" but no less entertaining. Tarantino does play some dirty pool with the narrative withholding particular bits of information from the audience until late in the game but never more so than what Christie used to do in her prime. The pitch-black wit of ""Jackie Brown"" is on display here as well making for engaging and unpredictable exchanges between the characters even as the tension swells around them. Once again the filmmaker has assembled a top-notch cast and given them characters and dialogue that allow them to really sink in their incisors. Its a fascinating ensemble but if theres an MVP its Goggins whose character turns out to be much more and much less than one might imagine on first viewing straddling a fine line between clever and idiotic villainous and sympathetic. See Photos Quentin Tarantinos Hateful Eight Premiere Hits Hollywood Police Protest Is a Bust Tarantinos frequent use of the N-word will no doubt inspire both challenges and defenses -- Id argue that as it was in ""Django Unchained"" the term allows modern audiences to experience period racism that much more vividly -- and theres also the matter of Jennifer Jason Leigh who spends much of the movie getting punched in the face by various characters. Its shocking at first as its intended to be but Daisy winds up being just as dangerous and threatening (and just as hateful) as the men around her and her treatment winds up feeling strangely equal-opportunity when all is said and done. Not everyone will see it that way of course and if the film sparks debate about the treatment of women in violent action movies then so much the better. If theres one element of ""The Hateful Eight"" that merits the lavishness of the production its Ennio Morricones score -- the extravagant Western has always been one of this legendary composers many wheelhouses and hes given free rein to craft another grandly exuberant and haunting soundtrack. Now that hes given us a talky indoor Western one wonders what other strange genre mashups Tarantino has in store -- perhaps a black-and-white musical staged as a radio play? In any event ""The Hateful Eight"" may frustrate some of his more literally sanguine supporters but its nonetheless an entertaining piece of dialogue-driven theater -- with the occasional rifle-shot to the head.

TWITTER 12/25/2015 Tarantinos latest starring Samuel L. Jackson and Jennifer Jason Leigh is a twisted combination of John Fords Stagecoach Agatha Christies Ten Little Indians and Jean-Paul Sartres No Exit. Most of us were raised to believe that cowboys were men of few words but Quentin Tarantino is out to prove otherwise in The Hateful Eight a three-hour Western thats windy both inside and out. There is absolutely no doubt about who wrote the elaborate pungent profane and often funny dialogue that a fine cast chews over and spits out with evident glee nor as to who staged the ongoing bloodbath that becomes a gusher in the final stretch. But set mostly in the confined space of a remote haberdashery/stagecoach stop the piece plays like a weird combination of John Fords Stagecoach Agatha Christies Ten Little Indians and Jean-Paul Sartres No Exit albeit with a word count closer to Eugene ONeills The Iceman Cometh. If this makes it sound like Tarantino is moving toward being as much a playwright as a filmmaker stranger things have happened. The directors loyal fans plus anyone keen to relish Samuel L. Jackson authoritatively stating how things are going to go down as only he can will turn out in ample numbers. But the wider public that made Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained 321 million and 425 million worldwide grossers respectively might not run out so readily to greet this nihilistic whodunit. To help create a hot-house atmosphere in a very cold climate Tarantino and his now-regular cinematographer Robert Richardson shot The Hateful Eight in 70mm -- specifically in the long-disused buff-cherished Ultra Panavision 70 format with a 2.761 aspect ratio. It seems rather perverse to choose this claustrophobic yarn as the excuse to justify rounding up old lenses and getting Panavision to create 2000-foot magazines to accommodate long takes as well as oblige Harvey Weinstein to track down and in some cases install antiquated projectors to facilitate the two-week 70mm ""roadshow"" engagements planned for about 100 venues beginning on Christmas Day. The films length notwithstanding the truth is that The Hateful Eight would never have been considered roadshow material back in the formats heyday Its not by any stretch a spectacle. The 70mm release certainly represents a very particular type of film buff event (the last ""Cinerama"" film to be shot on Ultra Panavision 70 was Khartoum in 1966) but how special it will be to a generation accustomed to Imax 3D and other modern experiential sensations remains an open question. Read more Star Wars The Force Awakens Film Review To be sure the film looks grand. The mountainous landscapes and snowfall of the opening reels have a dense splendor as a six-horse stagecoach makes its way through a Wyoming storm bearing bounty hunter John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his pasty prisoner Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) shortly to be joined by the imposing and loquacious Major Marquis Warren (Jackson) a former Union soldier now in the same line of work as The Hangman; hes got some corpses to get to Red Rock which is where Ruth intends to collect a 10000 ransom for Daisy. The two men share a mutual respect -- in fact Ruth once saved the majors life -- as well as some suspicion and a philosophical bent. The stage gets a little too crowded and quite a bit more uncomfortable personally politically and racially when a fourth passenger climbs aboard. A decade or more after the Civil War Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) remains an unreconstructed Johnny Reb who doesnt much cotton to Warren or the letter the latter carries with him written by Abraham Lincoln. Mannix announces that he is on his way to Red Rock to take over as the new sheriff which could pose some problems for his two cash- and justice-seeking coachmates. This setup occupies the first two of what ultimately come to be six chapters the rest of which unfold almost exclusively within the relatively comfortable confines of Millies Haberdashery where several more colorfully unsavory rascals with recognizably Tarantinoesque vocabularies greet these riders from the gathering storm. Theres yet another hangman Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth) a brash Britisher with a bowler hat; Bob (Damian Bichir) a supposed friend of the absent Minnie; watchful cowboy Joe Cage (Michael Madsen); and former Confederate General Sanford Smithers (Bruce Dern) another unrepentant racist with special reasons to hate Major Warren. Read more Quentin Tarantino ""Im Probably Only Going to Make 10 Movies"" The real test of Tarantinos decision to shoot in 70mm comes inside as it raises the question of what advantage a super-widescreen format serves when the drama is mostly limited to one room. To eyes old enough to remember luxuriating in the brilliance of Ultra Panavision 70 in its heyday (on films including Ben-Hur Mutiny on the Bounty and The Fall of the Roman Empire) The Hateful Eight offers a different sort of experience. Up to a point Tarantino uses the space and blocks the actors in ways that emphasize the power dynamics raise suspicions and otherwise highlight details that will provoke drama laughs and surprise. But where you really notice the difference is in the detail picked up in faces right down to the pores teeth and hair. Faces and expressions are uncommonly vivid and expressively not unflatteringly so -- even when Leighs face is covered in blood and her front teeth are mostly knocked out. By contrast there are moments of distortion or when Richardson racks focus that prove jarring and unnatural (at a Los Angeles press screening the image onscreen during the films first half kept fluctuating in and out of focus suggestive of a problem with the print moving through the gate not an issue with the film itself). So was the indulgence of 70mm worth it? If youre a director with Tarantinos track record a fanatical devotion to celluloid over digital and the wherewithal to make it happen sure why not? Anyone who loves great images on the big screen will appreciate the experience. All the same longtime devotees of the form including those who flock to Hollywoods American Cinematheque and elsewhere to behold restored 70mm prints would no doubt rather see an epic film in the format than something closer to the scale of The Petrified Forest or Key Largo. Of all of Tarantinos films perhaps the one that might have been best served by a high-end format like this wold have been Kill Bill Vol. 1. Once all the characters get comfortable under one roof the film itself settles down into a protracted talkathon in which unsavory connections coincidences prejudices resentments and intentions among the characters bubble to the surface. But liquids take longer to boil at high altitudes and so it is with the percolating drama the film very slowly builds up as it chugs along toward intermission which arrives at the 101-minute point (already longer than Reservoir Dogs). Read more Anti-Police Brutality Protesters Support Quentin Tarantino at Hateful Eight N.Y. Premiere A sign that things are going to get more complicated in the 74-minute second section comes with the abrupt arrival of explanatory narration -- spoken by the director himself -- to the effect that not everything is what it seems. Ever since he first used the device of narrative doubling-back so successfully in Pulp Fiction its been hard for Tarantino to resist pulling that same rabbit out of his hat. Nifty as it is in casting everything weve already seen in different light as well as in intensifying the drama the technique cant continue to deliver the same surprise and impact after multiple uses. As suspicion mounts over who might be guilty of a poisoning and in cahoots with bad girl Daisy Major Warren insists ""Lets slow it down. Lets slow it way down"" and its a sentiment Tarantino has taken to heart; this is a movie that takes its own sweet time. Hardcore Tarantino fans who relish every word he writes -- his dialogue does remain extra juicy and instantly recognizable as his own and no one elses -- will have little problem with the verbosity on display. But theres no question that Tarantino has increasingly come to ignore the virtues of brevity and tight construction whether out of simple infatuation with his own prose or because length has not been seen to be a problem on his last two epic period-set features. One takeaway from the live read of the script Tarantino presented in April 2014 at Los Angeles Ace Hotel Theater with most of the present cast was that a bit of trimming was in order. But while the final act was considerably rewritten the length seems only to have increased. Overlapping from Django are strong expressions of racial resentment between Jacksons Major Warren and Derns General which involve not only innumerable N-word utterances but also an explicitly obscene backstory the revelation of which provides some long-awaited comeuppance. Read more Hateful Eight Cast Talks Prepping for Post-Civil War Western Tarantinos Movie Retirement As ever with Tarantino films however some of the performances are lip-smackingly delicious. After having received too little screen time many felt in Django Jackson gets a full share of the verbal opportunities here and he makes the most of them rolling the words around in his mouth immaculately enunciating and otherwise relishing his choice dialogue. The other standout here because of the outrageous extremity of her role and the relish with which she embraces the very depths of depravity and filth is Leigh who ends up looking like she could instantly spawn a child resembling Linda Blair at her worst in The Exorcist. Russell also clearly revels in his deep-dish dialogue while Channing Tatum joining in late in the game proves a stellar addition to a crowd of Hatefuls. The most minute details of production designer Yohei Tanedas central set and costume designer Courtney Hoffmans work are shown off in 70mm. Although Tarantino has borrowed excerpts from Ennio Morricones work for his soundtracks in the past this is the first time the now-87-year-old Italian great has ever written an original score for the director. It would be nice to be able to say that his first soundtrack for a Western since his Leone heyday ranks with his best but its of a somber emphatic nature and is put to relatively limited use. The name of Jacksons character is derived from Charles Marquis Warren the director of such 1950s Westerns as Tension at Table Rock and Cattle Empire while the last name of Leighs character is no doubt taken from 1940s Howard Hughes discovery Faith Domergue.

The Civil War didnt end at Appomattox but still rages in the hearts and minds of Quentin Tarantinos ""The Hateful Eight"" a salty hothouse whodunit that owes as much to Agatha Christie as it does to Anthony Mann. Though Tarantino toys with many of the lawless frontier genres classic tropes its arguable whether this deliciously long-winded mystery -- ""molasses-like"" to use his own term -- qualifies as a Western at all. It might more aptly be considered an ongoing North-vs.-Southern seeing as how it crams hair-trigger racial tensions into an otherwise neutral outpost where a mixed bag of gunslingers uneasily try to make nice during a blizzard. The gratuitous bloodletting and hefty running time (the 70mm ""roadshow"" version clocks a thrilling 187 minutes including overture and intermission) should appeal primarily to cinephiles building word of mouth in the week between Christmas Day and Dec. 31 when it makes a killing in wide release. Last year Tarantino announced a career plan that would see the director retiring (or perhaps turning his attention to television) after 10 films and in light of his own self-imposed limit the helmers eighth feature initially appears to be an entry half-wasted falling into the more disappointing B-movie category of Tarantinos oeuvre wherein he takes second-rate genres and gives them the most impressive possible spin. Theres no denying hes been down this road before whether it was reheating the spaghetti Western to such spectacular effect in ""Django Unchained"" or exploiting the distrust among eight other near-strangers in ""Reservoir Dogs""  at the outset of his career. Familiarity aside however the movie absolutely delivers on the sheer moment-to-moment pleasures fans have come to expect from dynamite dialogue to powder-keg confrontations. A roundup of old faces and new thrown together in Minnies Haberdashery -- a rustic watering hole that serves as these varmints only shelter from an encroaching storm -- the film assembles eight ruffians in the middle of Wyoming including a reunion of Mssrs. Blonde (Michael Madsen) and Orange (Tim Roth) who appear here as a black-hat cowboy and a dandy British hangman respectively. Joining them are two bounty hunters who cross paths in the snow John Ruth (Kurt Russell) and Maj. Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) the former tasked with escorting his quarry a feral lady outlaw named Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to the gallows in Red Rock. En route they encounter the towns replacement sheriff Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins) while waiting ahead at Minnies are a standoffish Mexican (Demian Bichir) and surly rebel general (Bruce Dern). Inexplicably the hateful head count fails to acknowledge John Ruths ostensibly benevolent driver O.B. (James Parks) who would otherwise be No. 9 or the elephant in the room namely the palpable disdain broiling between this handful of ex-Confederate racists and Jacksons African-American former Union officer who wields a letter from Abraham Lincoln as skillfully as he does his six-shooter. Warrens motives are mysterious enough at first though when others fail to respect the hard-fought spirit of emancipation and equality he emerges as the still-seething embodiment of that old Ezekiel verse ""I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers."" Jackson never gets a monologue of such awesome caliber here although Tarantino does give him some of the best lines in a screenplay that audiences had the rare chance to read in advance of seeing the film -- a peculiar situation owing to the fact that an early draft leaked online. But Tarantino writes dialogue that begs to be performed and even a live reading in April 2014 couldnt suggest what the magic ingredient of cinema would do for his vision. Underscoring his commitment to celluloid the director dusted off the Ultra Panavision 70 format used on such Cinerama epics as ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" and ""How the West Was Won"" but put those vintage lenses to curious use all but ignoring the outdoor vistas (a victim of Jacksons scenery chewing no doubt) in order to achieve a more claustrophobic cabin-fever dynamic. Still the film opens atmospherically enough first with a striking pre-credits placeholder -- an ""Overture"" card that depicts a six-horse stagecoach racing from right to left in silhouette against a bold red screen -- before cutting to a long shot of the same vehicle riding into frame as a snow-covered cross looms in the foreground. Tarantinos use of music like his choice of shooting formats marks a dramatic break from the rest of his oeuvre in which the control-freak director has creatively recycled existing songs and score while giving them such currency that they may as well have been written for him. Here by contrast he relies on Ennio Morricone to set the tone and gets a stiff synthesizer-driven horse kick of anticipation from it. While Tarantino excels at slow-build suspense (and word is out that a bloodbath awaits) Morricones eight-minute mood-setter indicates the violence is coiled and ready to strike. The pleasure at least for those who havent sampled the script in advance comes in waiting. Tarantino has conjured a sense of the Old West -- not unlike the unforgiving frontier of Alejandro G. Inarritus ""The Revenant"" -- where its every man for himself which means the only safe way to interact with a stranger is to assume that hed kill you without a moments thought. We sense the wariness as Warren attempts to board Ruths private stage; the dynamic intensifies once they pick up ""son of a gun"" Mannix; and its anybodys guess what could happen when these travelers arrive at Minnies to find no sign of either its owner (Dana Gourrier) or the inseparable Sweet Dave (Gene Jones). Sly hints indicate what might have happened -- from a stray jelly bean wedged between the floorboards to the broken ""whore"" of a door that wont close unless its nailed firmly shut -- though that shifty feeling that settles once all the characters are safely indoors arises less from anything thats overtly said than from the actors body language and whatever menace lurks behind their words. Naturally each of them knows more than hes letting on which puts ""The Hateful Eight"" squarely in parlor-mystery territory. It may take place somewhere outside Red Rock a few years after the Civil War but the plot could conceivably work just as well in a dark cobwebby castle somewhere in Eastern Europe. Stretching the suspense as far as it can possibly go as is his wont Tarantino withholds the first bullet until roughly the 100-minute mark breaking for intermission just after the first corpse hits the floor. The body count climbs much faster as soon as audiences have regained their seats ultimately reaching a figure far higher than the title eight (a trick Tarantino pulls off by turning back the clock to earlier that morning). The director even insinuates himself just after the intermission narrating what transpired during the break and introducing a twist whereby someone poisoned the coffee while audiences were restocking on popcorn. Everything in a Tarantino movie is done with a wink and this touch practically tips it into parody as in an episode of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" where our macabre host drops by to mock the dead. But then this is precisely the level on which audiences have been enjoying the story thus far suspended somewhere between the ultra-stylized faux-period parlance (in which the excessive use of the ""N word"" speaks more to Tarantinos street cred than to any defensible sense of authenticity) and the self-awareness that every actor is sinking his (or her) tobacco-rotten teeth into what could potentially be the open-range beefiest roles of their careers. Few helmers take greater satisfaction in reminding audiences that they are watching a movie and though the material itself seems hardly substantial enough to suit an hour-long television episode (Delmer Daves told the superior -- and superficially similar -- ""310 to Yuma"" in a tight 92 minutes) Tarantinos treatment makes it epic. That encompasses everything from the roadshow format which insists upon a grand theatrical viewing experience to the wider-than-widescreen aspect ratio. Tarantino and ""Django"" editor Fred Raskin have even relaxed the tempo so that we might scrutinize every frame of d.p. Robert Richardsons luxurious work. It all looks like a set though interiors are blocked in such a way that audiences have a choice where to look while closeups register every facial twitch. Some faces -- and indeed some performances -- hold up better than others at that scale. Bug-eyed Goggins nearly always seems cartoonish in other roles but rather astonishingly integrates into the ensemble here whereas Roths wonderfully named Oswaldo Mobray doesnt belong an escapee from ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" or some entirely different movie. Bichir Madsen and Dern get their moments but find themselves overshadowed by Russells and Jacksons far hammier performances. Popping up late in the game a miscast Channing Tatum upsets the delicate chemistry leaving audiences to debate whether he or character actor Craig Stark (as Derns son who appears in an outrageous but only half-credible flashback) endures the more humiliating fate. Of the eponymous eight Leigh creates the most memorable new character -- the one who stands to gain the most if the others lay each other low. Her bruised face and broken voice suggesting false docility while her calm indicates something dangerous waiting around the corner. ""Domergues Got a Secret"" reads one chapter heading though that could just as well be the movies title considering all the crones got to hide. Daisy takes a beating over the course of three hours and though some have already suggested that such brutality (often played for laughs) is no way to treat a lady Tarantino treats her like one of the guys. Frankly the movies gender dynamics arent nearly as rich as its racial politics though the latter subtext is what makes this more than just a fresh stew of ""Grindhouse"" leftovers but a deserving hateful eighth entry in one of American cinemas most distinctive filmographies.

Film was a load of crap i feel its more racist towards whites than blacks. When are white people going to wake up instead of kissing black arse. Reply whiteman says February 26 2016 at 257 am Just watched this racist film that should have never been made or shown. Always putting down the white man made by white men. Terrible film. Will anything be done about it? No it wont again an attack on white people. Reply Leslie Lloyd says January 15 2016 at 133 am The film was boring Reply Bus Douglas (Dubb1842) says January 5 2016 at 501 pm Just saw the movie-nothing special. The payoff at the end was not worth an almost 3 hour movie. I wouldnt even say its a movie you have to see and I am a Tarantino fan Reply JohnnyC says January 2 2016 at 450 pm I disagree about Channing Tatum. While I was surprised hed been cast and was expecting an unsatisfying performance out of him I thought he was quite good in the role. Same for Tim Roth I thought it was one of his finest performances. Reply JohnnyC says January 2 2016 at 445 pm I loved it so much I watched it a second time the next day and loved it even more. Reply Stinkyweezleteet says January 1 2016 at 606 am The good part mustve come near the end. I thought it dragged so bad I walked out a little more than half way through. Reply Helen Highly says January 1 2016 at 927 am Actually yes one of the best parts does come at the end -- the reading aloud of the full Lincoln letter. It was a brilliant and beautiful Tarantino moment First Samuel Jackson is wreaking ferocious brutal havoc and then a minute later we see him listening to the letter which he has held so dearly for so long being read aloud and watching his face I felt so much for him (and from him). The movie goes from crazed depravity to heartfelt sincerity to wacky comedy all within minutes. Thats the wonder of Tarantino. And not many critics have written about the Lincoln letter perhaps not wanting to give away the surprise connected to it (which I will not mention here). But that letter is a meaningful part of the story and really helps to tie it all together. And its the last great moment of the film. Its really where the film ends for me (although it does go on for a bit longer). SO yes... you should have stayed till the end. Reply Desiree says December 29 2015 at 639 pm Just saw the roadhow version. 187 minutes. Very entertaining. Didnt feel like 3 hours. Didnt mind the use of the N word or the B word or the rape mysogeny and racism. Recommend it to all QT fans Oh yeah Im a black female FYI. Reply WTF Guy says January 3 2016 at 100 am Um you COULD preface your comments with a spoiler alert you twerp. Reply CavalierKong says December 24 2015 at 306 pm ""Bug-eyed Goggins nearly always seems cartoonish in other roles but rather astonishingly integrates into the ensemble here..."" A couple of offhand insults to one of the best actors working today. Hes fantastic in every role he takes. Reply bobbyF (robert_forton) says December 22 2015 at 1234 pm Not his best by far. A bit too long and the plot could have been better. And just too much use of the N-word. Yes its realistic people used that term and its not taken out of context. But how many films is that now QT? Is it absolutely necessary? Reply JFA says December 22 2015 at 100 am Dont know how one could not mention Leones Once Upon A Time in the West when pondering the films influences. Maybe Debruge isnt familiar) lol Reply Bryan Moore says December 20 2015 at 830 pm Are you talking about the book of Ezekiel in the Bible? Do you have chapter and verse for this? he emerges as the still-seething embodiment of that old Ezekiel verse ""I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers."" You wouldnt try to make up scriptures would you? Bmoore Reply John says January 23 2016 at 148 pm So... youre not at all familiar with Tarantino? That adulterated verse was used in Pulp Fiction some 20 or so years ago. Reply Curtis says December 20 2015 at 240 pm Doctor ""Im going to change your prescription from Ambien to The Hateful 8. Will put you to sleep faster."" Reply allie says December 19 2015 at 427 pm Who cares about this racist hayeful garbage. No thank by Reply Lg1215 (Lgmermaid2016) says December 18 2015 at 608 am DEAR MR. TARANTINO - Or - Why this Black guy can no longer vouch for you in the barbershop after seeing your film and reading this review... Im super confused that no one has brought up how overly racist this film truly is at its heart. It boggles my mind. Im am/was a huge Tarantino defender but after seeing this film at a screening I was uncomfortable at the over-use of the N-word (NIGGER) why not just say it here? No one seemed to mind laughing every time it was said in the movie theater. As an African American - this film was so uncomfortable to sit through. At least with Django there was context and I knew what I was walking into - but I was not prepared for for this. I wanted to write a review because I got to see it before any one else but I let it go - assuming the critics would see it. I guess you guys missed it. Tarantino does not have street cred. The majority of blacks will feel as uncomfortable as I did when they hear the audience laughing at every racial slur. Its that Dave Chappelle Moment on the Chappelle Show that led the star to give up his gig and a gazillion dollars. Hearing the way a white audience member laughed at one of his bits chilled him so dearly to the bone that he left his show and never returned...questioning if he was actually doing more harm then good. Well now I get it. After three hours of hearing that type of laughter during the film...it simply tore me apart. Whats worse is that this film actually thinks its a comedy. I was such a fan that I waited to the finale of the film hoping there would be redemption or meaning to this madness. Nope. Great three hours of fun right? I could give you eight hateful reason why THE HATEFUL EIGHT is racist at its heart which now makes me go back and question every film Tarantino has written - maybe the dude is racist. Maybe Spike Lee was right. No way right? So I go back and look at Tarantinos work RESEVOIR DOGS PULP FICTION JACKIE BROWN INGLORIOUS BASTARDS DJANGO THE HATEFUL EIGHT (Also TRUE ROMANCE infamous speech between Hopper and Walken; NATURAL BORN KILLERS - yes it was rewritten but much of the racial slurs are in his first draft;). All of these films is guttered with ""Nigger"" this and ""Nigger"" that. And we keep freakin laughing and giving this guy a pass. I know that no one will really care. Im just saddened by it all; and I know that at this point I can no longer vouch for Tarantino or support his work. I even question his TRUE MOTIVES for the March in New York against police brutality. Maybe that was an offensive move to ease this bitter pill the majority of blacks will swallow when it comes out. I keep telling myself that Im just being sensitive I mean...Sam Jackson appears okay right? Hes always the one saying ""nigger"" or being called ""nigger."" He even goes on a publicity tour every time theres a controversy in regards Tarantinos use of the N-word. I do find it interesting that he literally played a House Negro in Django...is art actually representing reality? Has Mr. Jackson somehow becomes Tarantinos House Negro. Im not uptight. I am super liberal...graduate from USC. So I get it. Im just really heartbroken. I loved this guy my entire life. My idol has failed me. Reply Robert says December 28 2015 at 803 pm I am an old white guy that lives in the south and I am as conservative as they come. When my wife and I finished this movie without talking I new this was the last QT movie we would ever watch. I think one of QTs black friends told him it was OK to use the word nigger and he has decided to over use it in every movie. I cant give this racist any more money. Reply taperecorder3 says January 7 2016 at 740 am Thank you for your thoughtful analysis. Ive been suspicious of Tarantino ever since the True Romance script. He comes across as a maniacal child-man who relishes in every verboten he can as a film maker. Go back in time to the mid 90s where we see him spit into a reporters face on the red carpet because he thought the man had insulted his father in print one time. Well turns out QT had the wrong guy it was somebody else who just so happened to work for the same magazine. No apologies from QT however. Talented director and writer. Still a complete jackass though and a very suspect individual. Helen Highly says December 29 2015 at 656 pm I wrote the big long rave review above and I just wanted to say that after reading what you wrote here (which I failed to read before I posted my ""comment"") you have definitely given me pause. Like you I have long been a Tarantino lover and defender. But I think you make an excellent point about how this film will play to a black audience. If I were black I would be as uncomfortable as you were watching this in a theater. Im not doing a total turn-around about my admiration for the film (for all its other wonders) but I will definitely take a step back and recognize this angle that I had simply not considered before. (I am a white woman and I emphatically insist that Tarantino is not a misogynist. But even if he is sexism is not the same kind of bigotry as racism in America; it doesnt cut as deeply. So its not the same issue.) I was a big fan of Django Unchained because I thought Tarantino really had something to say there and he was using shock tactics to make the audience hear it and feel it. And I think it worked. But I do now see how I have just given Tarantino ""a pass"" to continue using the N-word anywhere and everywhere without consideration. I dont think he ""earned it"" with the content in this film. Hateful Eight was as I wrote a big splashy thrill ride. And he could have given us the good parts (and the shock and awe) of the movie without throwing around the N-word so callously. I dont think it was central to his message here. Yes this movie did of course address racism and it would be easy to defend Tarantino by saying that he was showing the horror of it not supporting it. But... your comment about how you felt sitting in the theater says it all. Dee2062 says December 26 2015 at 1035 am Another black Tarantino fan who cringed during this entire film. The film was racist and Tarantino does not have ""street cred."" I grew up in the south where the confederate flag was part of our state flag but I never heard the N word used so many times over my entire life as I did in one sitting of this movie. I sincerely believe QTs protesting against police officers is to make up for the back lash hes about to receive from black filmgoers. I will never again spend money on a Tarantino film. Reply Helen Highly says January 1 2016 at 917 am Well I guess they removed my big long comment above. Thats a pity. Variety editors I wrote a detailed and valid comment that specifically referenced your article. You removed it because I mention I have a blog? You should re-think that policy. You are going to lose me (and others like me) as readers and contributors to your discussions. Sal U. Lloyd says December 26 2015 at 1031 am Very good post. Spike Lee criticized Django. Reply Elle says December 23 2015 at 559 pm Welcome to reality. I have suspected for some time that Mr. Tarrantino was buying ""street cred"" by exposing his own racism and projecting it onto his characters and the audience. It is entirely possible to have some degree of talent and be an odious human being. Reply Josiane Ochman (PiloteXYZ) says December 16 2015 at 435 pm You cant beat Tarantino for great film openings nobody does justice to credits/title etc...the way he does. Can only think of one film this year who delivered on that score a foreign import called Marshland in English a killer thriller with riveting opening scenery rest of the film equally good. Reply Peter H. says December 29 2015 at 557 pm Try the opening of ""Ride Lonesome"" sometime. Budd Boetticher 1959. Reply wiles11 says December 16 2015 at 1138 am Delmer DAVIES? Reply TC says December 16 2015 at 704 am ""Bug-eyed Goggins"" was phenomenal in The Shield and Justified so I dont find it astonishing at all that he ""integrates into the ensemble here."" Reply Alejandro says December 16 2015 at 1233 am Could we now get a review thats not written in riddles? Reply Bill B. says December 15 2015 at 901 pm Cant wait. There are not many more interesting directors out there than Tarantino. His portion of Four Rooms was as awful as the rest of it but I dont think he has ever made a film that I didnt find fascinating to watch. Reply Dee says December 15 2015 at 732 pm Debruge Duuuuuude ALL of Tarantinos movies are pastiche or homage to ""second-rate genres"" to use your phrase and likely ( mostly) seen during a trip to the drive-in. ""Reservior Dogs"" amp; ""Pulp Fiction"" are throwbacks to the gangster films of the 40s (and maybe 50s) as well as the crime films of the early and late 70s. ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Django Unchained"" are homage to Blaxploitation flicks as well as the specialized black P.I. films of 70s and spaghetti westerns. ""Kill Bill"" volumes one and two are obviously homage to the kung fu flicks of the 70s and to anime. ""Deathproof"" is DEFINITELY drive-in flavoured going for the gory killer on the road flicks that sometimes popped up on those screens. And ""Inglorious Basterds""? Pick ANY b-level WWII flick and youll see it reflected in this over-the-top outing. Homage to B-movie/drive in level cinema is what Tarantino is all about. What makes him great is the quality of his scripts and the undeniable directors eye behind the camera. Reply Occultology says December 15 2015 at 727 pm That last sentence in this review is incoherent; try not to cram every thought in your head into a single sentence next time. Doesnt anyone edit copy anymore? Reply wiles11 says December 16 2015 at 1144 am Unless it was rewritten since you complained the sentence is grammatically sound. If it wasnt rewritten then you just have difficulty with long sentences clearly. Reply craig says December 15 2015 at 708 pm Im so happy to see Jennifer Jason Leigh on the screen again in a big character-driven movie. Reply Rudy Mario says December 15 2015 at 602 pm No mention about cinematography or whether the reviewer saw it in 70MM or digital... Reply Marty Pfeiffer says December 15 2015 at 423 pm Same old westerns that find themes that are tired. In addition I am done with Tarantino after he chose the wrong side of the law once again. Reply Jerry12345 says December 15 2015 at 552 pm So you are saying you support police brutality? You support the killing of unarmed civilians? Gotcha. Reply Jimmy Green says December 15 2015 at 410 pm It may be worth sneaking in for free at the multiplex but I wouldnt pay one penny to see a slow moving repetitive derivative Western from this hack. Reply Jerry12345 says December 15 2015 at 551 pm Hack? LOL Have you ever seen ANY of his movies? Probably not. Reply Jimmy Green says December 15 2015 at 718 pm yes Ive seen all of the movies he has COPIED from more talented directors. His future will be that of Cimino. All flash no substance. Hateful 8 = Heavens Gate. Scott says December 15 2015 at 155 pm Ive seen it but seriously do you have to give away do much for those who havent? Reply Jerry12345 says December 16 2015 at 828 am Hes not copying anything. Its called homage and pastiche. If you knew anything about good movies (which you dont) you would know that. Just because he borrows certain elements from other movies doesnt make him a ""hack"" and actually makes him better because it shows you how much he actually knows about cinema. Reply Berke Zane says December 26 2015 at 302 am Are you running cover for the guy Jerry? Gary Gibson says December 15 2015 at 1250 pm The score is not synth driven...those are bassoons playing dissonant notes. And there is a large choir as well. Its freaking Ennio Morricone for crying out loud. Reply SPIKE says December 15 2015 at 1244 pm this is just butt-kissing a B-movie maker. you can add all the snappy dialogue you want. its still a B-movie. why? because Tarantino not having anything meaningful to say in the medium of film should have stayed in the video store where he belonged. Reply JC says December 15 2015 at 302 pm Yeah he should have stayed in the video store and never made those millions of dollars received those Oscar nominations and wins won the Cannes Palme dOr become one of the biggest names in Hollywood etc. Im sure if you went back in time visited him in the video store and explained his options to him he wouldve stayed in the video store. I hope youre not an agent. Reply LOL says December 15 2015 at 1242 pm Sounds crap. Reply cadavra says December 15 2015 at 1157 am Its definitely not a western. Change the costumes and replace the stagecoach with a bus and it could be 1970 instead of 1870. And a correction HOW THE WEST WAS WON was shot in good old 3-camera Cinerama not Ultra Panavision. ITS A MAD MAD MAD MAD WORLD would be a correct example. Reply BK says December 15 2015 at 324 pm Exactly as Cadavra says - which makes me discount the entire review.

Minutes later were treated to a spectacular wintry landscape captured on 65mm film with the long-deserted Ultra Panasonic 70 lenses a feat announced in the credits alongside the pronouncement of ""the 8th film by Quentin Tarantino."" Then comes a full hour of story set within the confines of a stagecoach and two more inside a cabin -- separated by a 12-minute intermission. Welcome back to Planet Quentin a self-contained universe of cinematic pastiche outrageous dialogue cartoonish violence and labyrinthine storytelling that plows ahead while veering off on tangents every which way. These vibrant ingredients have been the touchstones of Tarantinos oeuvre for nearly 25 years but ""The Hateful Eight"" unleashes them in a wild unvarnished stream of possibilities. This is not a filmmaker whose work tends to show signs of compromise but the unwieldy excesses of ""The Hateful Eight"" proves he can get away with anything. READ MORE Quentin Tarantino Misses the Point About Hollywood Blockbusters While ""The Hateful Eight"" meanders it never drags. Tarantino has ostensibly constructed a slow-burn whodunit sped up by the vivacity of his characters. Interlocking agendas collide when a pair of bounty hunters show up at a cabin in the midst of a snowstorm where their fellow stranded travelers form a suspicious bunch. Everyones a suspect but nobodys entirely innocent. During the aforementioned first hour the filmmaker gradually establishes the Wyoming-set world of post-Civil War attitudes and its no surprise to find that they arent pretty. http//v.indiewire.com/videos/indiewire/the-hateful-eight-HatefulEight_Clip_EverybodysGotAMother.mp4As the heavy blizzard coats every inch of the landscape Major Marquis ""The Bounty Hunter"" Warren (Samuel L. Jackson) winds up deserted right in the path of fellow bail agent John ""The Hangman"" Ruth (Kurt Russell). Scowling from his seat in a stagecoach through his one good eye this proto-Snake Plissken already has his bounty in tow noted killer Daisy ""The Prisoner"" Domergue (a leering Jennifer Jason Leigh). Intent on hauling Daisy to nearby Red Rock where she faces execution he resists Warrens request for a lift but ultimately caves due to the smooth-talkers innate charms. It doesnt take long before theyre joined by another straggler Chris ""The Sheriff"" Mannix (Walton Goggins) a dapper wide-eyed figure claiming to be Red Rocks new sheriff. Tarantino hovers among this trio for some time mostly so that the two hardened killers can trade barbs while the cheery sheriff cuts through their tension and Daisy chuckles from the sidelines. Their exchanges range from tales of battlefield exploits to suspicions of unspoken alliances; ironically though ""The Hateful Eight"" has been elegantly designed for the big screen by cinematographer Robert Richardson its first scenes largely unfold in closeups. As the exuberant chapter titles fly by (""One Last Stage to Red Rock"" ""Son of a Gun"") Tarantino eschews exposition for the opportunity to luxuriate in these outlandish caricatures. Alternately engaging and one-note their exchanges hardly amount to more than Tarantino sharpening his weapons of chaos that erupt during the bulk of the movie that follows. Ultimately the quartet arrive at the isolated cabin Minnies Haberdashery and with the exception of a few perfunctory flashbacks its there that ""The Hateful Eight"" stays. Inside the ensemble doubles The monosyllabic ex-General Sanford ""The Confederate"" Smithers (Bruce Dern) sits by the fireplace with Oswaldo ""The Little Man"" Mobray (Roth) who claims to be Red Rocks new hangman; Bob ""The Mexican"" (Demian Bichir) mostly sits at the piano while Joe ""The Cow Puncher"" Gage (Michael Madsen) lurks in the corner. The hired killers automatically suspect everyone of something and over the ensuing two hours plenty of malicious schemes arise before the inevitable arrival of bullets and blood when ""The Hateful Eight"" tips into sheer sadistic mayhem. An erratic doodle with a lot on its untempered mind ""The Hateful Eight"" offers a provocative snapshot of angry Americans wrestling through the paradoxes of the postwar south. Western tropes form merely the vessel for Tarantinos erratic conceits about race violence and justice. Thats hardly uncharted terrain for the director. With its minimalist setting and vivid themes ""The Hateful Eight"" operates like ""Reservoir Dogs"" set in the world of ""Django Unchained."" In other words its Tarantinos playground; watching ""The Hateful Eight"" feels like hanging out with a sensibility. Once the movie settles into its chamber drama mode the dialogue keeps bubbling up always on the verge of another tense confrontation. Virtually every energy level gets some representation Leigh a screeching villain who spends most of the movie in chains and hurtling epithets at her captors runs counter to the measured delivery by Jacksons Bounty Hunter which unquestionably gives the actor some of his best material since ""Pulp Fiction."" Surrounded by bigotry he triumphs with the most vicious attitude of all. In a playful monologue about revenge which builds to depraved extremes shortly before the intermission -- set to ""Silent Night"" of all things -- Jackson comes closest to imbuing this wandering story with a fiery soul. Nevertheless ""The Hateful Eight"" often gets weighed down by its busy agenda most noticeably as familiar faces -- from Zoe Bell to Channing Tatum -- come and go. A random voiceover narration crops up more than two hours in and certain enticing characters never receive their due. But theres no doubting the sheer vision on display. Attitudes and trains of thought define the aesthetic. Every scene displays the DNA of a filmmaker who first made waves with a bunch of gangsters chit-chatting about Madonna. In ""The Hateful Eight"" the discursiveness once again looms large. Questions such as ""Who poisoned the coffee?"" and whether a congratulatory letter wielded by one character was actually written by Abraham Lincoln never distract from the plot; they supplant it. Ultimately ""The Hateful Eight"" belongs to Jackson and the frustrations that the Bounty Hunter has been engineered to portray. When he shouts ""Wake up white boy"" to one character he may as well be addressing all of them. Once again the actor embodies a figure of great vengeance and furious anger but with grander symbolic ramifications than the hitman in search of redemption he portrayed in ""Pulp Fiction."" Here hes the catalyst for ""The Hateful Eight"" which like ""Django"" and ""Inglorious Basterds"" turns history into fantasy to expose its psychological reverberations. Tarantinos screenplay hodgepodge that it is nevertheless contains endlessly rich observations. ""Dispassion is the essence of justice"" one character asserts essentially condemning the entire cast -- and in the process society at large. No matter how absorbing its individual scenes however ""The Hateful Eight"" is often hindered by Tarantinos confidence in the material. For every gripping sequence theres an abrupt development or undercooked throwaway line. Crude behavior and blunt twists drown out the subtleties of Tarantinos filmmaking prowess. The inanity of the violence in the closing scenes overtakes the works deeper ramifications and reduces its appeal turning a complex portrait of attitudes into a simpler one of rage. The grim finality of the movies concluding shot ranks as the most cynical moment in Tarantinos career. But its a less savvy punchline than a punch to the gut.

You obviously missed it Reply mike smythe May 12 2016 313 pm The movie looked good. Previews were interesting enough for us to decide to go. Uncles and aunts. Nephews and their teenage friends. Im 50. I enjoyed it. My wife enjoyed it. The kids all three of them aged 18 22 and 23 all loved it. It was long. It was gory. It was Quentin Tarantino. Im glad I went. Everyone we went with enjoyed it too. The theater was full. Everyone stayed. No one walked out. At the end the conversation was all positive. Go see it cause it looks good to you or dont go see it cause you dont think it will be the kind of movie youll enjoy. Simple really. We went. We enjoyed. Will we see another Tarantino movie? Guess what? If the trailer is enjoyable we will. If it isnt we wont. We may change our minds if people whose opinions in movies are similar to ours see it and suggest we go. Its not a life or death decision. If its bad. Its bad. Ah well. If its good well yay For a couple of hours we lost ourselves in something that we wanted to and in the end thats the only thing that matters. Reply Chris May 12 2016 313 pm DA despite having not seen this film you find it necessary to compare it negatively to an Altman film. Having seen both I can say that I preferred hateful eight because I could understand the dialogue Reply Jarvis May 12 2016 313 pm Hands down this is one of Tarantinos best films to date. Im always astonished at the level of dispirited able comments Ts aimed at QT amp; the numerous almost ridiculous levels some go trying to discredit the man as a film maker. Sorry...but the man is an artist amp; what he drags out of his players...its astonishing. Everyone should see this one. Reply Gabriel Fregoso May 12 2016 313 pm I went to the Tarantino live read in L.A. and to me it was Breakheart Pass meets Reservoir Dogs. Reply Beth May 12 2016 313 pm Once again I must stand by my assertion that Mr Tarantinos films are one thing a valid point in the argument against excessive use of Adderall with over diagnosing of ADHD Reply Enrique May 12 2016 313 pm Roberto That comment made you sound pretentious. Why did you even clear clicked on a review of the new Tarantino film if you are gonna leave that stupidity of a comment? Reply Joshua Stephen Ward May 12 2016 313 pm Ultra Panasonic lenses? Really? Reply Roberto May 12 2016 313 pm I honestly have no desire to see a Tarantino film anymore. Thats probably because I am no longer 16 and am now pretentious. Reply DA May 12 2016 313 pm From the trailer - at least cause this is just a perception since havent seen the movie yet and honestly i am not sure I will eventually - it looks like more than a homage (especially with those great 70mm Panavision visuals) of Robert Altmans masterpiece ""McCabe amp; Mrs.Miller"" minus all the incredible insightful characters development the stunning lirycal story telling and profound affecting disillusionment so rich of texture and classic political undertones and romantic idealism so characterizing Altmans unforgettable epic highly personal vision social commentary and ground breaking filmmaking .
