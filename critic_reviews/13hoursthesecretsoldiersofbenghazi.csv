Finally the director weve all been waiting for--Mr. Bayhem himself--weighs in on the most complex and controversial episode of American military history in recent years. With that joke out of the way lets grapple with a more difficult truth Bay hasnt done that bad a job. He still loves his American flags (this time it floats limply in an abandoned Libyan embassys swimming pool) and hell always be on shaky ground when a movies plot basically turns on a bunch of heavily armed bros stranded in a parking lot waiting for a rescue go-ahead that came minutes too late. But when 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi turns into the two-hour-long action symphony it can barely wait to become--a harrowing stretch of shadowy aggressors charging the walls of a compound bullets pinging off metal spent ammo casings showering the cement underfoot endless carnage--this director is completely in his wheelhouse. Its some of the most concentrated work Bay has ever done dropping his customary slo-mo (and a fair amount of visual coherence) to create a fully intentional chaos that feels as fitting to Benghazis Alamo-like midnight standoff as Steven Spielbergs Normandy Invasion did to Saving Private Ryan. Theres very little political commentary here. No actor is cast as Hillary Clinton firing off secret emails; nobody questions the selfless heroism of the soldiers involved; and ambassador J. Christopher Stevens a casualty of the attack deserves a more honorable tribute--hes a bit of an afterthought. Even when embodied by a cast that includes John Krasinski and A Separations Peyman Moaadi Chuck Hogans screenplay has a hard time carving out distinctive characters from all the bearded warriors A slimy indecisive CIA chief (David Costabile) makes the deepest impression. The final word on this incident will require a more thoughtful filmmaker. But hopefully that artist will possess at least half of Bays punishing peerless craft.

Few words have become more politicized in the last decade than this one the Libyan city where on September 11 2012 two U.S. diplomatic compounds were sacked and four men (including Ambassador Chris Stevens) killed. It became a political football kicked back and forth during the 2012 campaign and for years after. Its to the credit of director Michael Bay that he largely succeeds in removing politics from the equation. 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is unquestionably jingoistic and will incite patriotic fervor among some but it doesnt play the blame game. Instead its an old fashioned war movie of the sort John Wayne (and his like) used to make a good guys vs. bad guys shoot-em-up (although updated with the kinds of pyrotechnics that Bay loves to film). The movie is imperfect and overlong but its never boring. And although aspects of its factual accuracy can be called into question it does a decent job of chronicling what happened that night. 13 Hours focuses on the events of September 11-12 and in particular how they impacted a six-man team of military contractors working for the CIA Jack (John Krasinski) Rone (James Badge Dale) Tanto (Pablo Schreiber) Boon (Dave Denman) Tig (Dominic Fumusa) and Oz (Max Martini). Events unfold in several acts each featuring mayhem and death. The films first half provides background information (delivered in typical Bay rapid-fire fashion) and details the attack on the main compound. The second half focuses on the Alamo-like defense of the second compound as it comes under attack by three waves of militants. Its cowboys and Indians except the location is Africa and the participants have machine guns mortars and rocket launchers instead of rifles and bows. Although some of the gun battles are protracted this kind of story plays to Bays strengths as a filmmaker. Character development is kept to a minimum (and on those occasions when it happens it does so with cringe-worthy dialogue and/or flashbacks). The director is a master of brewing adrenaline-and-testosterone cocktails and thats what he does here. The film bubbles with tension and excitement and theres never any doubt about the identities of the good guys (the American ex-soldiers) and the bad guys (Libyan extremists). The one character existing in the gray is Bob (Dave Costabile) the weaselly CIA honcho whose goals dont align with those more interested in saving lives rather than going by-the-book.  Bay doesnt deal in subtlety and nothing of the sort is attempted in 13 Hours. This is a straightforward action-thriller that never pretends to be anything other than what it is. Its strong strain of American patriotism may make it a hard sell beyond these shores. The chaos that arises during the prolonged battle sequences leads to a sense of disorientation. Bays intention is to immerse the viewer in the experience and to a degree this works. Unfortunately it also makes it difficult at times to figure out whats happening. At one point I was uncertain who had just died. And although Bay tries to use maps to establish geography they are presented too quickly for the viewer to process them. The lack of spatial clarity feeds into the confusion that arises at times during the battles. One problem with 13 Hours is character differentiation. With the exception of Jack who is given the most fully realized background there is a sameness among the protagonists. The only way were able to tell them apart is that they look different. But theyre all essentially the same person the macho ex-soldier who has left behind a family to hang out with his brothers in a hellhole half a world away from home. John Krasinski despite being known primarily for his comedic work in the TV series ""The Office"" gives a respectable dramatic performance here coming close to making Jack a fully realized human being. No one else accomplishes anything similar. Although the on-screen content of 13 Hours steers clear of the Benghazi political firestorm that wont keep the film from being dragged into the fray. However by keeping the perspective limited to those who are on-site the movie avoids thorny questions about upper-level negligence incompetence and indifference. Theres no questioning that this is a Bay movie. The directors DNA is burned into every frame its loud long and chaotic but its also entertaining when accepted on its own terms. The film is targeting the American Sniper crowd but comes to the party with the existential and philosophical questions stripped away. Its a very different experience that stands in stark contrast to the wave of ""revisionist"" war movies that have become the norm in recent years. 13 Hours is a triumph of the ""traditional"" (pre-1970s) school with a whole lotta explosions thrown into the mix. 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (United States 2016) Director Michael Bay Cast John Krasinski James Badge Dale Pablo Schreiber Dave Denman Dominic Fumusa Max Martini Dave Costabile Toby Stephens Screenplay Chuck Hogan based on a13 Hoursa by Mitchell Zuckoff Cinematography Dion Beebe Music Lorne Balfe U.S. Distributor Paramount Pictures Run Time 224 U.S. Release Date 2016-01-15 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Violence Profanity) Genre Action/Thriller Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Die Hard (1969) Speed (1994) From Russia with Love (1969) worse movies of this genre Revolver (2007) Abduction (2011) Specialist The (1994) Three...better movies of John Krasinski Wind Rises The (2014) Leatherheads (2008) Away We Go (2009) worse movies of John Krasinski License to Wed (2007) Something Borrowed (2011) Promised Land (2012) Three...better movies of James Badge Dale Shame (2011) Iron Man 3 (2013) Walk The (2015) worse movies of James Badge Dale World War Z (2013) Lone Ranger The (2013) (There are no more worst movies of James Badge Dale) Three...better movies of Pablo Schreiber (There are no more better movies of Pablo Schreiber) worse movies of Pablo Schreiber (There are no more worst movies of Pablo Schreiber) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/reelviews/13-hours-the-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi,200,13hoursthesecretsoldiersofbenghazi1,13hoursthesecretsoldiersofbenghazi,reelviews

Still enough blame is implied to make 13 Hours Donald Trumps early pick for movie of the year. More News 50 Most Anticipated Movies of 2016 Revenant Mad Max Dominate 2016 Oscar Nominations 25 Reasons We Loved the Movies in 2015 All Stories >> Related 13 Hours Can Michael Bay Pull Off a Movie About Benghazi? ""We told him wed waterboard him if he got it wrong"" says former Marine John ""Tig"" Tiegen This is Bays cinematic celebration of the six brave American security operators on the ground on Sept. 11 2012 when an attack by Islamic militants ended four American lives in Benghazi Libya. Clumsily adapted by a tin-eared Chuck Hogan from Mitchell Zuckoffs 2014 nonfiction bestseller the movie effectively captures the frenzy of the ambush. Thats pretty much it for the good news. The rest is pure Bay as when he borrows a trick from his abysmal Pearl Harbor and shoots a scene of real-life tragedy from the point of view of a bomb. The director of a trilogy of Transformers twaddle still gets more jacked up by machines than people. And yet this time a bit of humanity peeks through the din in the form of several solid actors. John Krasinski as Jack Silva and James Badge Dale as Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods bring a distinct human touch to the roles of former Navy SEALs now hired for 150000 a year by the CIAs Global Response Staff to protect U.S. intelligence operatives and diplomats in an unsecured Benghazi compound. These guys not only have to contend with liberal wussies at home but also condescending CIA elitists (Bay hates pencil pushers). In the words of the local CIA chief (David Costabile) mysteriously named Bob ""Youre hired help act the part."" Bob is also criminally indecisive about giving the order to move on the CIA Annex a mile away and rescue U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens (Matt Letscher) who died of smoke inhalation. Is there any hard evidence that anyone -- Clinton Obama our boy Bob -- ever issued a ""stand-down"" order? The film both exploits and dodges the issue. Im being generous to say that the script barely sketches in the other GRS operatives including Mark ""Oz"" Geist (Max Martini) Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto (Pablo Schreiber) John ""Tig"" Tiegen (Dominic Fumusa) and Dave ""Boon"" Benton (David Denman). Their phone-home flashbacks are the stuff of crass tearjerking. And Bay whose name on a movie should serve as a lepers bell to all those who think theyre getting the ""true"" story keeps jacking up the shootouts firebombs vehicle chases and a bus explosion that you wont find in Zuckoffs book. (Said bus doesnt transform into a killing machine with dialogue which is Bays one concession to subtlety.) There is a complex compelling subject to be examined here that the director ignores. Facts bore Bay so he beats them into the submission to avoid his greatest fear a dozing audience. Hoping to capitalize on the box-office bonanza of two previous rah-rah military movies that opened wide in January -- Lone Survivor and American Sniper -- Bay keeps blowing shit up for a punishing two hours and 24 minutes. Is there an audience for this? Sadly yes. Theres nothing wrong with a movie that cheers American heroes. But this one does so by reducing everything else to cardboard its Libyan villains merely faceless aliens in need of vanquishing. Several critics have given 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi a pass citing Bays skill at action engineering. Its his failure at everything else that makes this movie as hard to endure as it is impossible to believe. helpme Topics Benghazi John Krasinski Michael Bay Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

The movie depicts the deadly 2012 attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi Libya. By Peter Rainer Film critic January 15 2016 Save for later Saved John Krasinski stars as Jack Silva in the film 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. Christian Black/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of For many movie critics Michael Bay the director of the ""Transformers"" movies and ""Pearl Harbor"" is Public Enemy No. 1 - the auteur you love to hate. I dont quite go along with this assessment. Hes such a skillfully mindless moviemaker that I cant really get too worked up about what he perpetrates. Hating him would be like hating a robot or a hologram. For all the crash-and-burn in his movies they are in the end monumentally vapid.Which brings me to ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" which is Bays attempt to not only move away from ""Transformers"" territory but also to inject some real-world grit into his shenanigans. It depicts the deadly 2012 attacks on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi Libya which killed among others US Ambassador Christopher Stevens and on the secret CIA facility a mile away manned by ""private security officers"" intended to beef up what had already been deemed an inadequately secured position.Bay and his screenwriter Chuck Hogan adapting the nonfiction bestseller ""13 Hours"" by Mitchell Zuckoff and the members of the Annex Security Team resolutely avoid any overt political inferences. Hillary Clintons name is never uttered and the owner of the blame for the sorry state of security is never specified. Im not a fan of apolitical political movies in part because its a sham position To be apolitical about a subject like Benghazi is indeed to be political. (Previous candidates in this vein include ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""American Sniper"" whose audience this film will no doubt mainline.) Recommended The 50 best movies of all time On the other hand did we really want to see a political movie by Michael Bay? (Folks this is a rhetorical question.) He does well here what he always does well He keeps the action at full throttle. This is also what he does so annoyingly He always keeps things at full throttle. Or almost always - in a few sequences he slows things down so we can get  teary family tableaux from the home front. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide John Krasinski leads the beefcake corps as former Navy SEAL Jack Silva - he learns his wife is pregnant not long before the mortar shells go boom - and its impossible during the siege not to think of the Alamo with Jack standing in for Davy Crockett.  ""13 Hours"" is better than the ""Transformers"" movies and ""Pearl Harbor"" but after seeing it the only question I came away with is Will this movie hurt Hillary Clinton?

His brother in paramilitary arms isnt much comfort saying only that the ""something bigger"" he used to fight for is gone now but ""warriors arent trained to retire."" It stinks to be a soldier (especially when you get left hanging). The only thing worse it seems is being a jerky egghead CIA station chief. Or the bad guys and ""theyre all bad guys until theyre not."" Bay isnt great at making spatial sense of the skirmishes leading up to the last stand on the roof; nor is he subtle with his profundities (Joseph Campbells ""All the gods all the heavens all the hells are within you"" gets voiced three times). But hes hell on manly banter amid the explosions (""Just another Tuesday night in Benghazi"") and also moments carefully calculated to make you feel the horrors -- and the heroics -- of war.

In theaters Jan. 15. advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The story of the deadly attack on the American embassy in Libya in 2012.CAST John Krasinski James Badge Dale Pablo SchreiberRATED R (extreme violence)LENGTH 217PLAYING AT Area theatersBOTTOM LINE Michael Bays militant action film is technically proficient and politically simplistic. Depending on your political affiliation the release of ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" a dramatized version of the deadly 2012 attack that killed a U.S. ambassador in Libya could be cause for concern or celebration. The attack became highly politicized and remains a sore spot for then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton now a Democratic presidential candidate. With November looming and a Congressional investigation into Benghazi underway could ""13 Hours"" be the January surprise that damages the Clinton campaign? ""13 Hours"" is based on the book by Mitchell Zuckoff and directed by Michael Bay whose big-budget pro-military blockbusters (""Armageddon"" ""Transformers"") are typically more pandering than political. It stars John Krasinski as an empathetic Jack Silva and James Badge Dale as grizzled veteran Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods part of an ex-military security team hired to guard a CIA compound. These soldiers are pressed into action when well-armed militants -- whose nature and origin remain controversial -- attack the residence of U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens (Matt Letscher) and then chillingly the compound itself. advertisement | advertise on newsday This murky and tragic affair seems an odd choice of subject matter for Bay who normally stages human-versus-alien battles. Here Bays action sequences are as riveting and technically beautiful as ever but his reductive worldview is also on display. ""13 Hours"" doesnt just lionize its American soldiers it oozes disdain for everyone else. That includes puffed-up bureaucrats prissy British guys Yale-educated bozos in Washington and women who dont know their place. ""Put on your headscarf"" one American soldier yells without irony at a mouthy European played by Alexia Barlier. As for the Libyans theyre mostly a bunch of blood bags who explode when shot. More movie reviewsLatest movie reviews Though ""13 Hours"" never names Clinton it clearly believes that mistakes were made and that the attack -- despite initial claims from the Obama administration -- was premeditated and organized. The films main message though seems to be that Libya isnt worth the rubble in its streets and that Americans died there for no reason. Pablo Schreiber as exasperated soldier Kris Paronto tells a local interpreter ""Your countrys gotta figure this out."" In this movies opinion its that simple.

Black Hawk Down detailed the disastrous 1993 Battle of Mogadishu. Lone Survivor dramatized an unsuccessful counterinsurgency mission in Afghanistan. American Sniper was a dark work about the psychological toll of warfare.Related Story Michael Bay A New Kind of Director The story Michael Bay tackles in 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is as notorious by now as its grim the 2012 attack on an American diplomatic compound in Libya in which a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans died. Like other directors in the genre Bays primary goal is to tell a jingoistic story of bravery against all odds. Hes tried this in the past notably with Pearl Harbor a film that documented the devastating Japanese surprise attack on the U.S. Navy and somehow tried to turn it into a gung-ho tale of victory. With 13 Hours hes grown subtler and more cynical and has produced a better film (the bar being admittedly low) thats focused on the minutiae of the Benghazi attack and the CIA contractors who fought off Libyan insurgents in the hours after the initial attacks.The heroism here is embodied by those contractors not the government employees who largely serve as nuisances and incompetent distractions. While its hard to discern a clear message from the movie outside of ""Americans good terrorists bad"" theres an edge to Bays devoted individualism. Here are the people who knew best what to do 13 Hours tells its audience. If only theyd been allowed to do it sooner.Its worth noting that Bays long been slavishly devoted to Americas public servants from the Miami cops of Bad Boys to the NASA team of Armageddon (aided by private oil drillers sure) to the U.S. military (the stars of Pearl Harbor and the Transformers series). But his last movie the atrocious Transformers Age of Extinction cast the CIA as villains led by a paranoid Kelsey Grammer working to undo American interests from the inside. In 13 Hours by contrast the CIA arent evil but theyre a huge nuisance gumming up the works in Libya seemingly failing to provide any kind of warning about the attacks and not letting the films heroes do their jobs.Bays analysis of overseas diplomacy doesnt amount to much beyond that partly because 13 Hours script based on a 2014 book of the same name by Mitchell Zuckoff only attempts to give a straightforward account of what happened on the ground in Benghazi while taking a number of liberties with details established by ongoing investigations into the attacks. Like Zuckoff Bay focuses wholly on six CIA contractors so there are no fictionalized phone calls from Hillary Clinton or conspiratorial whispers about Barack Obama. Still when trouble hits the crack team of contractors stationed at a CIA annex near the ambassadors residence ask to dive right into the action and the CIA station chief (played by a stammering David Costabile) tells them to back off. By the end of the night everyone is openly regretting that call.With 13 Hours Michael Bays primary goal is to tell a jingoistic story of bravery against all odds.Among the contractors are the straight-arrow new arrival Jack Da Silva (an absurdly muscular but no less deadpan John Krasinski) the wildcat leader Tyrone Woods (James Badge Dale) and the wisecracking Kris Paronto (Pablo Schreiber). Theyre all military veterans whove found their way into the more lucrative field of military contracting--quasi-governmental employees who dont seem to have a designated space in the chain of command. You could be charitable and interpret 13 Hours as a critique of the convoluted way in which America organizes its military and the crossed wires of intelligence and defense that contributed to the confusion on that day. But there isnt enough in the film about where these guys fall in the grand scheme of things just grousing from the contractors about how they know best how the situation in Libya is a powder keg waiting to blow and how nobodys prepared for it.They arent wrong--but once things kick into high gear about an hour in politics largely drops out of the conversation. 13 Hours clocks in at nearly two and a half hours and much of the 90-minute extended-action setpiece that closes the movie involves the films heroes shooting down bad guys from afar dodging RPGs and bemoaning the generally screwed-up state of affairs on the ground--which hardly justifies the running time. Amid the action there are touches of bleak humor from the ensemble who are uniformly solid macho and very bearded but theres little sense of human tragedy.As the film winds to a close and the heroes prepare to ship out one looks back over his shoulder and tosses off the line ""This countrys gotta figure this shit out"" as if that counts as advice. Whats Bays take on the loss of life at Benghazi? It was bad and possibly avoidable--but hey Libya sure is a messed-up country. People cried ""too soon"" at the idea of a Benghazi movie coming out just a few years after the attacks and they were right to not just for reasons of sensitivity. Ultimately the U.S. doesnt have nearly enough perspective or hindsight to place these events in a context worth examining artistically so all Bay can do is stage some gnarly fire-fights praise the gumption of his main characters and shrug his shoulders at the rest. 13 Hours presents itself as a straightforward war film but thats the last thing a subject this complex needed.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control. Continue Reading Library of Congress How Abigail Adams Proves Bill OReilly Wrong About Slavery David A. Graham The Fox hosts insistence that black laborers building the White House were ""well-fed and had decent lodgings"" fits in a long history of insisting the ""peculiar institution"" wasnt so bad. In her widely lauded speech at the Democratic National Convention on Monday Michelle Obama reflected on the remarkable fact of her African American family living in the executive mansion. ""I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves. And I watch my daughters two beautiful intelligent black young women playing with their dogs on the White House lawn"" she said. On Tuesday Fox News host Bill OReilly discussed the moment in his Tip of the Day. In a moment first noticed by the liberal press-tracking group Media Matters OReilly said this As we mentioned Talking Points Memo Michelle Obama referenced slaves building the White House in referring to the evolution of America in a positive way. It was a positive comment. The history behind her remark is fascinating. George Washington selected the site in 1791 and as president laid the cornerstone in 1792. Washington was then running the country out of Philadelphia. Slaves did participate in the construction of the White House. Records show about 400 payments made to slave masters between 1795 and 1801. In addition free blacks whites and immigrants also worked on the massive building. There were no illegal immigrants at that time. If you could make it here you could stay here. In 1800 President John Adams took up residence in what was then called the Executive Mansion. It was only later on they named it the White House. But Adams was in there with Abigail and they were still hammering nails the construction was still going on. Slaves that worked there were well-fed and had decent lodgings provided by the government which stopped hiring slave labor in 1802. However the feds did not forbid subcontractors from using slave labor. So Michelle Obama is essentially correct in citing slaves as builders of the White House but there were others working as well. Got it all? There will be a quiz. Continue Reading The Tiny Irish Island That Will Welcome American Refugees Nadine Ajaka Welcome to Inishturk where they really dont like Donald Trump.

Im not sure which one delivered more applause lines to determined partisans. But Im sure there arent many people who would have clapped equally at both. Although director Michael Bay has never demonstrated a particular agenda -- beyond his hero worship of guys with big biceps shooting even bigger guns - ""13 Hours"" involves recent foreign policy and the bloody attack that occurred on Secretary of State Hillary Clintons watch. And so its a movie thats going to be reviewed quite a lot this year -- mostly by political pundits and Republican candidates. True it never really mentions Clinton. In fact it saves most of its disgust for anonymous supposedly weak-willed CIA and Pentagon officials; the Libyan disaster it suggests was a failure of passion not policy. (Like every conservative Hollywood war movie since ""The Green Berets"" its convinced American warriors can win any conflict if the big brass and the pencil pushers just get out of their way.) In fact for an anti-politician movie its not very interested in discussing politics at all. We dont hear about how Libya got to be such a basket case or our long history in the region or even why were there now. ""Your countrys got to get its (act) together"" one American snaps to a Libyan as the film ends - as if Americas some uninvolved observer who just suddenly got dragged into all this. Bays film will still figure in the presidential race this year thanks especially to its pointed primary-season release date. But apart from its familiar pro-military ""Why dont you college-boy pinheads just let us do our job?"" gripe ""13 Hours"" (the posters subtitle ""The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" doesnt appear in the opening credits) mostly avoids Clintonian controversy to concentrate on what Michael Bay is really interested in. Making a Michael Bay movie. Thats not an easy thing to fake as you know if youve ever seen a Peter Berg movie. Sure everyone knows the tropes - a fluttering American flag somewhere big grins golden shots of the sun. Bays movies are all designed to look like big old-fashioned Coke commercials but with shots of cars exploding and flipping end over end. Bay still does it best though. Because Bay still believes in it. The film has four or five big action setpieces and theyre shot excitingly if somewhat confusingly -- car chases along madly twisting North African streets shootouts that light up the night sky spooky assaults by creepy-crawling militias. (For once Bays typically muddled choreography serves the story emphasizing that no one knows who the real villains are or where theyre coming from.) The film also celebrates as most Bay films do (including the underrated ""Pain amp; Gain"") the bromantic camaraderie of tough guys. Most of the security specialists we meet are ex-military veterans of shared adventures and sacrifices. They may not have gone to Libya to die for their country but theyre sure as hell still willing to die for a friend. And when the film sticks to those simple characters and those confusing bursts of violence its at its best. Unfortunately while Bay has an eye hes never had an ear and Chuck Hogans screenplay is full of clunkers tough-guy dialogue that seems made strictly for cheap applause. (""I need a bag full of money and a flight to Benghazi"" barks one swaggering hero. ""Youre not giving orders anymore youre taking them"" another security man snarls at the sniveling CIA chief. ""Youre in my world now"") At least though Bay has resisted his usual urge to give those lines to someone like Mark Wahlberg or Dwayne Johnson and instead cast quietly real actors. John Krasinski is a good low-key star as Jack the new arrival who we follow most closely on this awful job; James Badge Dale and Pablo Schreiber are just two of the specialists on his team. All are fine and that most of the faces are unfamiliar adds to the films verisimilitude and suspense. Anything could happen to anyone at any time. And often does. Again this is not a film - like ""Zero Dark Thirty"" or ""Black Hawk Down"" or ""Jarhead"" - that has a complicated point of view about our countrys foreign policy and the people called upon to execute it. Apart from its general distrust of Washington and college boys and admiration for the heartland and men of action its clearest purpose is to make an action movie about a modern-day Alamo. But while were with these guys Bay makes sure we cant look at anything else. Or stop hoping - even though we already know the gruesome ending - that somehow all of them are going to make it home alive. Ratings note The film contains strong language violence and gore. 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (R) Paramount (144 min.) Directed by Michael Bay.

Kate Taylor The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jan. 14 2016 337PM EST Last updated Thursday Jan. 14 2016 340PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Michael Bay Written by Chuck Hogan Starring John Krasinski Pablo Schreiber and James Badge Dale Classification 14A Year 2016 Country USA Language English With the obvious exception of the Iraq war the deadly 2012 assaults on an unsecured U.S. diplomatic compound and a nearby Central Intelligence Agency base in Libya must be the largest cock-up in recent American foreign relations. Trust Hollywood to turn the notorious Benghazi into the occasion for much American heroism. Its a really tall order and in 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi director Michael Bay only partly succeeds creating much genuine drama but also many dodgy moments in his film while unleashing a numbing amount of firepower along the way. The premise here borrowed from the book of the same title by journalist Mitchell Zuckoff is that with no U.S. military help in sight six admirably professional CIA contractors hired to provide security fought off dozens of gun-toting Islamist militants long enough to permit the belated removal of American personnel.Bay and screenwriter Chuck Hogan display lots of admirable professionalism but they tell their tense story from an exclusively American point of view; among the various competing militia in post-Gadhafi Libya the U.S. security detail cant tell friend from foe any more than the audience can. As shadowy figures overrun the diplomatic compound and then swarm outside the supposedly clandestine CIA base the film takes no definitive position as to the cause of the apparently spontaneous attack but does strongly hint at terrorist provocation and planning.If the enemy is a largely unknown force a movie needs to find some villains closer to home. Here its CIA commander ""Bob"" (David Costabile) who treats the contractors with professional contempt but when push comes to shove proves fatally indecisive. Specifically he is too slow to give them the authority to go to rescue U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens (played by Matt Letscher).(Stevens and a lone staffer caught with him died from smoke inhalation after militants set fire to the diplomatic compound; they were two of four American casualties in the attacks.)The film begins as contractor Jack Silva (John Krasinski) arrives to team up with his old friend and security veteran Tyrone Woods (James Badge Dale) who explains the volatility of the city and introduces him to the patronizing Bob. Add in a few more members of the security detail (Dominic Fumusa and Pablo Schreiber) all full of friendly machismo and gallows humour and a supercilious CIA spy (Alexia Barlier) too busy working her Libyan contacts to care about her own security and you have enough wit and tension in the American ranks to make for a gripping premise.But then the ambassador makes the stupid mistake of visiting from Tripoli and the shooting starts - and goes on and on. You feel for both the poor CIA paper pushers trapped in their insufficiently armed command post and for the macho dudes who have to protect them as ill luck follows poor planning and mortar fire follows machine-gun bullets.But you also feel for yourself If they are suffering the fog of war you are suffering the fog-of-action movie a phenomenon that Bay is all too well equipped to create having previously worked on the Transformers franchise.He tries to punctuate that fog with the odd moment of levity and sentiment; some of these are suitably amusing or moving and some of them just feel awkwardly out of place. The director shows particular poor judgment when he turns to the stereotypical figure of the friendly local translator for his comic relief and worse asks the powerful Iranian-American actor Peyman Moaadi (A Separation) to do it.Bay has attempted to carefully characterize and humanize each member of the security force and Krasinski Dale and Schreiber are largely successful at creating personable fighters but the Skype calls home the pictures of their kids and even their dirty jokes grow painfully sentimental by the films end. Whoever thought mercenaries could be such big saps?Alongside American valour Bay does show Libyan grief One of the more intriguing images in the film is that of mothers wandering through the field of corpses outside the CIA compound the day after the attack looking for their lost sons. Its a deft moment and one cant expect a Hollywood action movie to go much further but it does expose the problem with making a film set in Benghazi that depicts Libyans mainly as anonymous thugs. U.S. President Barack Obama asked in his State of the Union address this week how America could lead the world without becoming its policeman; 13 Hours is the cultural equivalent of that imperialist conundrum.

His ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" is straight up hoo-rah stuff a buffed-up if muddled tribute to the ex-military contractors who protected the compound and minimized the casualties during the event. (Its script is based on a book written with the input of several of those contractors.)Bay being Bay he favors quick-cut visuals big-time explosions and dramatic shots of the American flag. His style serves him well here and his central sequence -- a late-night raid on the CIA property -- is stirringly executed.But Bay being Bay his characters arent much more than grunts who get to look cool toting guns. His chief squad (John Krasinski and Max Martini among them) is made up of sweaty bearded toughs with names like ""Tanto"" and ""Boon"" and theyre virtually indistinguishable from one another. They drink Buds have families they miss back home and are always saying hello to each other by ironically stating ""Welcome to (fill in the blank)."" Three such greetings occur in the films first 30 minutes.Politics are checked at the door -- the words ""Hillary"" and ""Clinton"" are never mentioned -- but the movies attitudes about those dwelling outside the compounds walls are blunt. ""Theyre all bad guys"" says Tanto (Pablo Schreiber) ""until theyre not."" Hoo-rah.""13 Hours"" is so macho it practically has a Born to Lose tattoo on its arm.

Unlike the simplicity of ""Remember the Alamo"" a bleat of ""Benghazi"" still has people wondering ""Wait what happened? And why are we mad?""Michael Bays 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi has an explanation though it should be taken with a grain of salt -- or rather a kilogram of dynamite. Bay takes Mitchell Zuckoffs nonfiction book of the same name and amps up the action with explosions star filters and neon-blue lights that zip across our heroes heads as they tromp down the alleyways of Libyas second-biggest city on a night that will cost four Americans their lives. When a man plops his boots on a desk it sounds like a gun going off. When a gun actually fires it sounds like a thunderbolt from Zeus. Its the truth cranked up to 11 boosted with brand new firefights (in real life The Guardian found few bullet holes at the site of either skirmish) and a wholly fictitious bus blast that had my audience applauding with glee. ""That was for us"" a character grins. Yes literally -- it was invented for a crowd that prefers fist-pumping to facts. Film Details 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi RatingR GenreDrama Running Time144 min. More Info Trailer In an early scene Bay primes our engines with an octane-fueled car chase where two former Navy SEALs Rone (James Badge Dale) and Jack (John Krasinski) escape a suspicious van by smashing into fruit stands at full speed. By contrast Zuckoff a sentimental but terse Pulitzer Prize finalist for his work at the Boston Globe in the late 90s merely notes ""Eventually Rone lost the tail and returned them safely to the annex."" You can hear Bay groaning ""Boring. Those cars dont even talk"" When Bay finally does get to shoot a based-in-truth chase sequence starring the Embassys bulletproof SUV hes so excited that the car screams. 13 Hours is a story about timing. First that the U.S. government should have been on higher alert on 9/11 the eleven-year anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks. And second that for three Januaries in a row a quasi-historical Navy SEAL action flick has made a box-office mint. Like Lone Survivor and American Sniper 13 Hours is a love letter to our men in uniform. I cant say men and women because these films are always about the manliest of men guys who lift weights drink Budweiser and crack jokes like ""You lose your tampon?"" And technically the men in 13 Hours arent in uniform either. These were freelance contractors former SEALS Marines and Army Rangers who signed on to guard the CIAs secret Benghazi compound for 150000 a year. That didnt buy them much on-the-job dignity. As local CIA boss ""Bob"" (David Costabile) -- a cipher whos never been named -- sneers ""Youre hired help act the part.""Bay argues that the men at the center of his film were fighting two enemies the shape-shifting Libyan militias and the CIA snobs who trusted Harvard- and Yale-educated desk jockeys over these weight-lifting beer-drinking jokers whod actually been in the shit. Chuck Hogans script blows raspberries at everyone from the blonde agent (Alexia Barlier) who treats Jack posing as her husband with such condescension she nearly blows their cover to the cowardly Libyan guards who only care about their 28-a-day paychecks -- less than a local secretarys salary. ""Middle Eastern Keystone cops"" groans the guard (David Furr) in charge of protecting Ambassador Chris Stevens (Matt Letscher). Good old Bob however a doughy middle-manger in need of a dastardly mustache prefers the rent-a-Libyans to our band of saviors. ""Youre not the first responders"" he grunts. ""Youre the last resorts."" EXPAND Krasinski probably doesnt look directly at the camera with an exasperated look on his face at the end of this scene.

Everyone agrees it was a tragedy in which four men died two due to smoke inhalation two under mortar fire. Yet ever since some pundits and politicians have mourned with a dash of self-satisfaction -- it confirmed both their fears about terrorism and their pride in the brave Americans who put their asses on the line. By the time Bob vows ""There is no threat here"" the movie cant wait to prove him wrong. Bring it on bro. Of course 13 Hours doesnt extend any of that pride to the Libyans over 30000 of whom died in the first year of the 2011 revolution and who continue to die by the thousands. Every Libyan in the film is suspicious or pathetic even the ones who help the Americans fight. When two teens rush to rescue Ambassador Stevens Rone warns ""Dont shoot us in the back."" And when a translator (A Separations Peyman Moaadi) takes up a pistol to defend his country Jack jokes ""That dudes not coming back."" That dude does come back bloodied and sweaty not that he gets much credit. Jack shoos him off with the admonition ""Your countrys gotta figure this shit out Amahl."" Well theyre trying. Just last week 65 Libyan police trainees died when a truck bomb crashed into their academy not that well ever see a movie about that. And though the book and the film imply a sizable Libyan body count on 9/11/12 -- Bay even shows us some corpses -- no U.S. newspaper has ever confirmed any non-American dead. Either there werent any or no one cares. Libyas Culture and Information Minister Omar Gawaari has dismissed 13 Hours for turning ""Americas failure to protect its own citizens in a fragile state into a typical action movie all about American heroism."" He has a point. To Bays credit the director doesnt. Though Lone Survivor and American Sniper teetered into propaganda 13 Hours is adamantly apolitical -- unless you think all-American men of action knowing more than the bureaucrats is something new in action movies. It just wants to blow things up. Bay strips out any mention of Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama and then keeps stripping until even the characters themselves cant explain why they fight. Says Jack imagining his own funeral ""He died in a place he didnt need to be in a battle he doesnt understand in a country that doesnt mean nothing to him.""The actual men werent vague. Zuckoff quotes Tanto (Pablo Schreiber) a self-described ""avenging angel"" with a tattoo of St. Raphael battling the Devil with a crucifix as saying ""I dont wish the Crusades would come back. But sometimes I feel that they should come back."" And on the opposite side of the pew former SEAL Glen Doherty (Toby Stephens) fought against the encroachment of religious fundamentalism in the military. At his funeral his buddies toasted him with a flask inscribed ""What Jesus Wouldnt Do."" Here however Tanto and Doherty are pared down and purified until these ideologically opposed warriors united by valor are interchangeable guys with goatees. Theyre action heroes in an action movie that too many people will accept as truth. As ever the real story is both more complicated and more boring -- the stuff of books not movies. In Zuckoffs report theres a moment when former Marine Tig (played here by Dominic Fumusa) brandishes a flamethrower on an abandoned Benghazi street while the other men take pictures. They wanted to pretend he was a blockbuster star. And now he is. Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke? NEXT Contact Amy Nicholson Follow L.A. Weekly Film amp; TV L.A.

Pablo Schreiber from left John Krasinski David Denman and Dominic Fumusa in ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" (Paramount Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter At first glance it would appear that the only thing director Michael Bay and the Libyan city of Benghazi have in common is the initial letter B. Yet here they are joined at the hip in ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.""Bay best known for allowing toys to live large in the seemingly endless series of ""Transformers"" movies has taken it upon himself to make a film about the tragic 2012 attack on an American compound in Benghazi that has already become a political football in the campaign for the White House.

The events surrounding the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi Libya in 2012 have been investigated debated politicized scrutinized and criticized. Now its time for Hollywood to weigh in -- courtesy of Michael Bay. Yes that Michael Bay the director of four ""Transformers"" movies and the... (Steven Zeitchik) ""13 Hours"" however resolutely steers clear of any of the potentially controversial election-year implications of the incident in which four Americans including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens were killed. The film never so much as mentions the name of Hillary Clinton who was secretary of State at the time and has been the focus of waves of hyperventilating Republican attacks concerning it. Instead Bay has concentrated on doing what he does best which is action. Working from a Chuck Hogan script based on a joint memoir written by the participants he tells the story of half a dozen private security operators who slung lead for those 13 hours and prevented even greater carnage. ""When everything went wrong"" billboards around town proclaim ""six men had the courage to do what was right.""As noted Bay and his editors Pietro Scalia and Calvin Wimmer know what theyre about when it comes to putting gun battles on screen and theyre also good at creating the sense of menace and palpable unease that gripped chaotic Benghazi (the film was shot by Dion Beebe in Malta and Morocco) in the time before the attack. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link This action facility however is not enough to make ""13 Hours"" more than sporadically successful in part because at 2 hours and 24 minutes the film is too long for its own good and risks feelings of repetition and exhaustion.Also problematic is the storys sense of character and personality which doesnt often rise above the level found in the comic book series ""Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos."" And in its determination to steer clear of controversy ""13 Hours"" ends up confusing in its lack of specific information. It all starts with the arrival in Benghazi of bearded and determined Jack Silva (an excellent John Krasinski). Hes joining his good pal Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods (James Badge Dale) as part of a six-man contingent of former military men hired by the government as part of the Global Response Staff organization whose job it is to provide security in ticklish situations. In this case the GRS team is supposed to be protecting a clandestine CIA station that officially isnt even in the country.Making matters worse and one of ""13 Hours"" recurrent themes is the complete and utter contempt the CIA guys have for their protectors. Worst of all is the station chief known only as Bob (David Costabile) who calls them hired help and mocks them every chance he has which is often.Things get dicier when Ambassador Stevens (Matt Letscher) makes a flying visit to Benghazi. Housed at a vulnerable ""temporary diplomatic outpost"" not an embassy he and his party are soon furiously attacked in the middle of the night by a heavily armed band of evil-doers. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Because the reasons for the assault have become controversial ""13 Hours"" never tells us what aside from pure evil is motivating the attackers and thats confusing. And though we see various military and governmental entities outside of Libya monitoring the situation why they dont act faster to help is also never fully explained.Though protecting him is not in their job description the GRS guys are determined to save the man if possible. In the movie version of events which not everyone supports it is whiny CIA factotum Bob who stands in their way telling them to stand down and not attempt any rescue.Finally fed up the guys disregard Bob but they are too late. They then head back to the CIA compound which is soon subject to a ferocious assault of its own and the GRS team starts to resemble the Texans at the Alamo or even the British at Rorkes Drift in the film ""Zulu"" as they fight off waves of infidels and their ever-murderous intentions.Though its clear that the real GRS team performed exceptional feats ""13 Hours"" unlike Clint Eastwoods ""American Sniper"" doesnt end up portraying them with any kind of nuance. The film wants us to feel as one of the men they protect says ""Im proud to know Americans like you"" but were never really given the opportunity.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of BenghaziMPAA rating R for strong combat violence throughout bloody images and language.Running time 2 hours 24 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on January 15 2016 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""Here confusion reigns - Michael Bays film offers lots of action but little explanation about 2012 attack - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Movies Entertainment Africa Michael Bay Christopher Stevens Reviews Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad73deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-13-hours-review-20160115-column.html,200,13hoursthesecretsoldiersofbenghazi12,13hoursthesecretsoldiersofbenghazi,latimes

Photo Paramount Pictures MOVIE REVIEW 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi Running time 144 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity). On Oct. 20 2011 the president of the United States announced in a clip cruelly replayed at the outset of ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" that the death of Moammar Khadafy marked ""the end of a long and painful chapter for the people of Libya who now have the opportunity to determine their own destiny in a new and democratic Libya."" As it turned out democracy doesnt arise from long-distance best wishes. For all the blood bullets and fire shown in ""13 Hours"" there is a running theme With brave men such as these available why werent more of them deployed to give Libya a chance? ""Libya is officially a failed state"" reads a grim title at the end of the film. Michael Bays film is a salute to the grit and resourcefulness of the private security contractors (ex-military men including SEALs and Army Rangers) assigned to protect a CIA outpost and a nearby diplomatic compound in Benghazi Libya. On the night of Sept. 11 2012 jihadists attacked the latter area where only a gossamer ribbon of security protected US Ambassador Chris Stevens. Back at the CIA annex Benghazi veteran Tyrone Woods (James Badge Dale) is still explaining things to newcomer Jack Silva (John Krasinski) when the call for help comes in. But the security contractors are mere hired help to the CIA whose arrogant station chief (David Costabile) tells them to stand down. After an hour the fighting men simply ignore the boss and roar to the diplomatic compound to try to save Stevens and his small team. Pablo Schreiber.Photo Christian Black Theres a breathless hour of uninterrupted gunfight between the half-dozen security men and dozens of jihadists in the streets and though Bay makes the action thrilling and visceral overly rapid editing often muddies things. Moreover some scenes (such as an early one in which Tyrone talks his way through a roadblock by citing a nonexistent drone) are either too fanciful and movie-ish or too weepy and silly (Jacks wife on the home front gets overcome by the fog of war while trying to choose from the McDonalds takeout menu). ""13 Hours"" could have used more moments like the reflective one on the rooftop of the annex near dawn when Jack talks about how he wishes he could convince himself to stay home with his wife and kids. Still if ""13 Hours"" lacks the gravitas of ""American Sniper"" its powerful stuff. Bays goal is to put you right in these mens boots to feel the heat the fear the fatigue the weight of the weapons and the web of camaraderie.

By LINDSEY BAHR AP Film WriterThe most surprising thing about ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" is how Michael Bay makes 144 minutes pass so quickly. His excitable camera is always doing something whether shaking with hand-held authenticity to capture moments in battle or floating through scenes instead of staying static. It gives the entire experience a waterfall effect. This can be a little dizzying but it certainly keeps the energy up when the rounds arent firing.""13 Hours"" which Chuck Hogan adapted from Mitchell Zuckoffs book is about many things but Bay tries to zero in on that moment when those six contract soldiers tried to do the right thing in a difficult situation.It is neither as grossly gratuitous as Peter Bergs ""Lone Survivor"" nor as gripping as Ridley Scotts ""Black Hawk Down."" Instead ""13 Hours"" is a bombastic vulgar and often thrilling exercise in red white and blue machismo that relies too much on romanticized video game aesthetics and corny sentimentality to be a great film.Bays heroes are the brutes - the big hulking bearded security guys who know the country and the threats more keenly than anyone. Theres Jack Silva (John Krasinski) Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods (James Badge Dale) Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto (Pablo Schreiber) Dave ""Boon"" Benton (David Denman) John ""Tig"" Tiegen (Dominic Fumusa) and Mark ""Oz"" Geist (Max Martini).The actors are charismatic but they all seem more like types than real people. Recent-past tributes have a way of sanitizing to the point of obfuscation.But theyre all basically noble bros. Some read Joseph Campbell some Facetime with their kids and wives some quote ""Tropic Thunder"" and all look out for one another.They tolerate the sniveling condescension of doughy CIA analysts like the chief (David Costabile) who often reminds them that they are only hired help and that he and his fellow agents are the best and the brightest. He even rattles off the names of their Ivy League credentials as though hes Dowager Countess of Benghazi. Its ridiculous and over the top but it sets up Bays point - the soldiers know best and no one else can see as clearly whats going on in Libya.They gripe about how things were different in Iraq where they had a purpose they understood they had support in desperate situations and their compounds were up to standards.These guys know before anyone that the unofficial consulate housing Ambassador Christopher Stevens (Matt Letscher) just down the road from their base isnt safe and that the small security unit at the consulate wont be able to defend the grounds under attack. That proves to be true when the armed militants descend on the consulate (no motive is assigned). The soldiers back at their base in an annex facility are ready to jump but theyre told to stand down until they decide to just go anyway.Depending on what youre looking for ""13 Hours"" can function as a decent actioner a tribute to those who died an indictment of the power structure or all three. Its not a subtle movie nor is it anywhere close to being as elegant and dread-soaked as something like Kathryn Bigelows ""Zero Dark Thirty.""Bay reverts to some of his old cliches too like cheesy backlit American flags children frolicking in sun-soaked fields and slow-motion explosions. And while there are some exciting set pieces much of the 13 hour showdown is needlessly confusing.In illustrating extremely chaotic military situations filmmakers have a choice They can provide perspective that those on the ground didnt necessarily have or they can make it as disorienting as they imagine it was for those experiencing it. Bay chose the latter and its hard not to see that as a mistake.He films many of the action scenes like a first person shooter game where the vantage changes erratically. Sometimes it even seems deliberately misleading. Other times it just feels like nonsense.The parts that are clear also feel like a video game as the guys on the roof pick off approaching threats one by one.There can be compelling drama in a bureaucratic mess and it would have been interesting if ""13 Hours"" engaged more with that but you cant help feeling that ""13 Hours"" is going for thrills more than insight.This movie is a bellowing love letter to the guys on the ground and it sees them as they probably want to be seen.

Christian Black/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Christian Black/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures John Krasinski plays Jack Silva in a scene from 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. Christian Black/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures ""Countrys got to figure this [expletive] out Amahl"" growls a CIA security contractor to his Libyan translator on his way out of town in 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi Michael Bays account of the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound. Thats about the level of sophistication the film brings to the controversial incident which cost the lives of four Americans and remains a touchstone for critics of the Obama administration. Insofar as a film about Benghazi can be apolitical 13 Hours studiously avoids engaging in the contentious debate surrounding the attack to the point where ""Countrys got to figure this [expletive] out"" sounds as much like Bays conclusion as the contractors. Of course 13 Hours cant be apolitical Those who feel diplomacy was a folly in post-Gadhafi Libya and consider the governments actions faulty and negligent will find their opinions validated by the film if not exactly deepened by it. But Bays real interest here as in his other historical action picture Pearl Harbor is the grunts-eye-view of war which isnt as subject to partisanship. The ""secret soldiers"" of the title are the unsung heroes hes eager to champion men who beat back a coordinated and relentless assault on two U.S. outposts and kept more Americans from losing their lives. This is his Black Hawk Down a real-life shoot-em-up about elite military operatives stranded in hostile territory shredding wave after wave of faceless gunmen. Its the faintest of praise to call 13 Hours one of Bays best works given a resume dominated by Transformers movies but his narrow perspective and fidelity to the timeline keeps most of his juvenile fetishes in check. (Suffice to say Benghazi is woefully short on sports cars and derrieres.) Working from Mitchell Zuckoffs book the film stays close to the six interchangeable bearded warriors who in this telling spring into action when militants expose the woeful security around the U.S. diplomatic mission and a nearby CIA outpost. Chief among those warriors is Jack (John Krasinski) a seasoned operator whos barely out of the airport before facing down his first ambush. Jack and his macho comrades in the Global Response Staff--each with handles like ""Rone"" (James Badge Dale) ""Bub"" (Toby Stephens) ""Tanto"" (Pablo Schreiber) ""Tig"" (Dominic Fumusa) and ""Oz"" (Max Martini)--share their concerns about the vulnerability of both compounds but they fall on deaf ears. The powder keg is set off when a highly publicized visit from Ambassador Chris Stevens (Matt Letscher) coincides with street protests at U.S. embassies elsewhere in the Middle East over the anti-Islamic film ""Innocence of Muslims"" and the anniversary of Sept. 11 leading to an all-night assault on the Benghazi diplomatic mission and a not-so-covert CIA hub. Over a numbing 144 minutes Bay toggles between two equally unappealing modes The high-tech spectacle of heavily armed GRS soldiers re-staging The Alamo mowing down dozens of Zombieland militants from the roof and the downtime where the men Skype their families and exchange dopey banalities like ""Paybacks a bitch and her stripper names Karma."" The lizard-brain simplicity of both makes it a minor blessing that Bay doesnt venture too far into political commentary aside from tarring a CIA Chief (David Costabile) as a condescending Ivy League egghead whos slow to acknowledge the reality of the situation. Diplomacy and restraint in Bays eyes fall under the banner of dangerously naive. The films second half gets into a better groove than the first mainly because the breathless action is confined to a fixed position rather than the open terrain of the Transformers movies which all collapse into visual incoherence. Bay settles on the uncomplicated rah-rah patriotism of Pearl Harbor all while making obligatory gestures against Islamophobia a local translator who joins the fight a shot of mourners rushing to the bodies the morning after signs and protests condemning the attack and mourning Ambassador Stevens et al. Those gestures are mere pebbles in the pond however when set against a backdrop of mass suspicion and hostility including a shot of Muslims praying next to their AK-47s and a GRS operative smugly describing the whole affair as ""just another Tuesday night in Benghazi."" For Bay the murky context of history isnt worth thinking about--yesterdays tragedies are todays passable action fodder.

"13 Hours film proves director Michael Bay should stick to fiction review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies13 Hours film proves director Michael Bay should stick to fiction reviewMichael Bay allows himself no dramatic wiggle room by insisting that 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a true story. Based on this confusing result he should stick to fiction.13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is directed by Michael Bay of Transformers fame.  (Paramount Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 14 201613 Hours The Secret Soldiers of BenghaziStarring John Krasinski James Badge Dale Pablo Schreiber Max Martini Dominic Fumusa David Denman and David Costabile. Directed by Michael Bay. At GTA theatres. 130 minutes. 14AMichael Bay allows himself no dramatic wiggle room by insisting that 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is a true story with no ""based on"" hedges or excuses.Its a declaration both brave and crazy for this most explosive of directors whose last big excursion into American history Pearl Harbor treated reality as a mere starting point. Hes much more at home with mindless fantasies about giant robots AKA his Transformers movie franchise.Article Continued BelowWith 13 Hours Bay seeks to show and tell how it all went down on Sept. 11 2012 in Benghazi Libya when militants attacked the U.S. diplomatic compound and a nearby CIA stronghold. Four Americans were killed including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and the political fallout over security lapses and insufficient response haunts the presidential bid of Hillary Clinton who was then Secretary of State.Bay and screenwriter Chuck Hogan (The Town) stick close to journalist Mitchell Zuckoffs lauded account of the attack which lionizes six ex-military CIA security contractors who bucked protocol to save lives. The ""bad guys"" on both sides are often spoken of but not personalized apart from a foot-dragging CIA chief (David Costabile) who actually gets off rather lightly. Clinton doesnt even rate a mention. This isnt a movie that wants to meddle in politics or even make much of a point.The restraint is laudable but in dramatic terms 13 Hours is almost as vacant as most of Bays films. He does only a cursory job of introducing the six macho men -- in particular close friends Jack and Tyrone played by John Krasinski and James Badge Dale -- who are seen as family-loving patriots who believe in doing the right thing rules be damned.Their personal stories get lost amid a confusing spray of bickering bullets and blood as the Americans try to figure out who the ""friendlies"" are within the volatile mobs invading their two spaces. Are they dealing with protesters terrorists or saviours?Our six heroes are ordered not to engage by their butt-covering CIA chief -- ""Youre not the first responders youre the last resort"" -- and this frustrates them (and also viewers) for much of the film until they finally take matters into their own hands. 13 Hours is a movie where the questions are asked first and the shooting happens later the opposite of Bays usual modus operandi.

TWITTER 1/15/2016 Michael Bays latest action extravaganza portrays the deadly 2012 attack on an American diplomatic compound in Libya. The vast and underserved heartland audience that made such a smash out of American Sniper a year ago finally has some fresh red meat to call its own in 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. Michael Bays latest in-between-Transformers picture actually features just as much action as his giant toy extravaganzas being an account of the waves of intense firefights that occurred at the American compound in Libyas second city on Sept. 11-12 2012. The big selling point of Mitchell Zuckoffs book about the incident which cost the life of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others was its revelation of the hitherto-unknown role special ops played in holding marauding local radicals at bay until all American personnel could be evacuated. But while this adaptation superficially goes out of its way to avoid being overtly political its patriotic tenor is as unmistakable as its sentimentality. Even if an unmentioned Hillary Clinton has nothing specific to worry about in regard to the films content its mere existence will stir up fresh talk about her behavior regarding the incident and theres no doubt that Donald Trump fans will eat this up more enthusiastically than anyone. Although it was never presented as such in news accounts the siege on the diplomatic enclave and the secret CIA facility a mile away resembles in its dramatization nothing so much as the battle of the Alamo albeit with a better ending as far as the Americans were concerned. As with so many accounts of Western involvement in the Middle East and other regions -- Black Hawk Down for starters -- this is the story of a fiasco one made less so by the fierce and selfless commitment of a few good men whose old-fashioned kick-ass attitudes form the crux of the yarns appeal. Anything remotely relating to the ongoing controversy over then-Secretary of State Clintons actions emails and what she knew when remains implicit; when its stated that both American diplomatic outposts in anarchic post-Muammar Gaddafi Libya including the relevant one in Benghazi were among the 12 such sites on the worldwide ""critical"" list meaning they were inadequately secured and vulnerable to attack one is nonetheless left to ponder where the buck stops on this sort of thing. In any event the governments answer is to supply a Band-Aid in the form of several ""private security officers"" the first among equals being former Navy SEAL Jack Silva (John Krasinski) who leaves his family behind one more time to take on a precarious assignment. This Davy Crockett analogue is surrounded by five other guys with nicknames like Tig and Boon and Tanto and Oz played by buff 30-ish actors whose bushy beards make it next to impossible to tell them apart. But this being a Michael Bay movie we can rest assured that theyre all tough potty-mouthed and at their best when sporting night-vision goggles and handling multiple forms of heavy artillery. Read more Box-Office Preview Michael Bays Benghazi Movie 13 Hours Could Be Politically Divisive Despite the well-conveyed sense of danger that seems to lurk down every street (some of Bays best work comes in multiple scenes of vehicles becoming trapped by would-be enemies) suspicious characters seen photographing the Yank facilities and the well-known proliferation of competing gangster and/or radical Islamist factions official American naivete about such matters prevails from the outset. The CIA led locally by a hard-headed by-the-book chief (David Costabile) loftily proclaims that ""There is no real threat here"" while Ambassador Stevens (Matt Letscher) arrives to make a ludicrously optimistic speech about future prospects. The Americans advisedly lay low on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 and the day passes uneventfully. The night however is another matter. Aided by missiles a mob attacks the compound at dusk setting parts of it afire. Confusion reigns Ambassador Stevens and his aide Sean Smith (Christopher Dingli) are separated from the security force and retreating to a safe room doesnt protect them from the heavy smoke that seeps in under the door (Stevens was determined to have died from smoke inhalation). The closest other Americans are 400 miles away in Tripoli and the nearest Air Force jets are based in Sicily; theres no help to be had. Although terrible damage has been done the invaders are eventually repulsed by the small band of Americans doing some very expert shooting. Fighting continues on the streets in scenes that carry a violent video game feel a new wave of marauders is turned back and as at the Alamo a period of low-simmering anxiety permeates the night as a follow-up bombardment is awaited. On the plus side the logistics of the situation are well conveyed; the position of the compound on the edge of the city the considerable distance between the two American buildings and their easy accessibility by would-be troublemakers due to their being bordered by public streets -- all this is clearly presented. Read more Ride Along 2 Film Review On the other hand there is a noticeable absence of dramatic modulation. To complain about this sort of stylistic shortcoming in a Transformers movie would seem akin to faulting a dish at Dennys for a lack of subtle seasoning. But in this context and given the solidly constructed and reasonably comprehensive script by Chuck Hogan (The Town) its easier to see what Bays style is all about which is achieving a high level of intensity and then keeping it there without variance. To use what under the circumstances is a far too convenient metaphor Bay is interested in accelerating from zero to 100 as quickly as possible and then maintaining speed rather than skillfully shifting gears and adjusting based on curves hills and road conditions. In this case he gets you there but you know the ride could have been a lot more varied and nuanced. Just as the sun begins to rise the mob launches a well-aimed mortar attack from just outside the nearby gates which is met by ferocious retaliation from the special ops. Little is spared in terms of showing what very high-caliber ammo can do to a human body and there is no doubt that combat and weapons freaks will get off on the comprehensive and detailed display of the latest equipment. At one point Bay cant resist repeating a shot he introduced in Pearl Harbor that shows a large mortar shell falling slowly and then exploding. The films worst moments reside in its cheap bids at sentiment in some of the mens brief exchanges with distant loved ones its calculated and banal paeans to family life expressed via video links. Unlike American Sniper this film doesnt bring up much less explore the tension within many men between the lure of danger and excitement and the longing for intimacy and home. Indistinct as some of them are within the group setting the actors do their tough and gruff stuff perfectly well led by Krasinski and James Badge Dale. As very few would claim to know what Benghazi actually looks like one can only presume that the vivid and evocative locations in Malta and Morocco serve their purpose very well while production designer Jeffrey Beecrofts reproduction of the American compound appears accurate down to the smallest detail. All craft contributions are robust while the musical score by Lorne Balfe achieves some weird and creepy effects.

Theres a concerted effort to depoliticize the story--neither Barack Obama nor Hillary Clinton is mentioned--but the movie will find a warm welcome in the red states with its simpleminded tale of brave men doing the right thing while the government falters. David Costabile is excellent in the thankless role of the CIA chief in Benghazi a haughty university type whose contempt for the soldiers (""Quiet You act like animals"" he barks as they horse around outside his window) sets him up for a massive comeuppance; by the final scene hes ready to crawl into the soldiers laps (""Im proud to know Americans like you"").

"Michael Bays Benghazi movie 13 Hours reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Michael Bays Benghazi Movie Is Loud Risible and Remarkably Astute About Foreign Policy Michael Bays Benghazi Movie Is Loud Risible and Remarkably Astute About Foreign Policy Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 14 2016 259 PM Michael Bay Goes to War The directors Benghazi movie is loud tasteless and remarkably astute about American foreign policy. By David Ehrlich Still of David Denman John Krasinski and Pablo Schreiber in 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. Still courtesy of Paramount Pictures The September 2012 attacks on the U.S. diplomatic compounds in Benghazi may have occurred less than four years ago but 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is the movie that Michael Bay has been waiting his entire life to make. He wanted to direct Black Hawk Down but Ridley Scott got there first. (Bay has begrudgingly approved of the movie that resulted.) He then wanted to direct Lone Survivor but Peter Berg snatched it out from under him. And just when it seemed like wed never again strand American personnel in a FUBAR situation on the soil of a distant country (pause for bitter laughter) Bay was finally able to acquire the rights to one of recent historys most violent wrongs. A military fetishist whose films share a profound concern for the seemingly one-sided relationship between the United States and its soldiers Bay has always expressed more sympathy for the (muscular monosyllabic) men who risk their lives for their country than he has for the peckerwood desk jockeys who give them their marching orders. Although he keeps his political persuasions private Bays unashamed American exceptionalism--which persists even in an intergalactic fight with shape-shifting robot aliens--has made him seem like a bombastic conservative in an industry thats dominated by outspoken liberals. Not for nothing but were talking about a guy who once made a movie about a team of oil drillers literally saving our planet. That Bay has volunteered himself to direct Hollywoods first--and likely only--Benghazi blockbuster might seem to confirm suspicions of his right-wing leanings. After all no one with a vested interest in Hillary Clinton being the next president of the United States would make any film about the most controversial chapter of her political career right? And now not only do we have a popcorn epic about this extremely delicate international incident but its directed by a guy whose most subtle movie stars Nicolas Cage. Advertisement And so imagine my surprise that more than anything 13 Hours almost feels ... humanistic? Almost. Bay has stated that his intentions were simply to honor the heroism of the guys on the ground and 13 Hours bears that out. The result much to my surprise is one of the most politically astute films about Americas foreign politics in years purely on the strength of what its willing to ignore. Which isnt to say that Bay doesnt have an eye on the big picture--13 Hours opens with a shot of the Earth as seen from space because though Bay seems offended by the idea that these soldiers deaths have been turned into fuel for a perpetual flame war hes certainly not above bending historical tragedy to his personal aesthetic. (This is after all the same guy who made Pearl Harbor.) We then get a crash course in Libyas recent history from the fall of Moammar Gadhafis dictatorship to the militias that rose from the rubble and how the overconfident U.S. government closed the vast majority of outposts it had established in the country. We fly into Benghazi with contractor Jack Silva (The Office star John Krasinski who now has all the abs) a scruffy family man who cant seem to stay away from the deadliest places on Earth. Hes the kind of hero who tries to call his wife during the middle of a firefight but this the kind of movie that wont give him enough time to get through to her. Jack is met at the airport by a ride-or-die badass named Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods (the indefatigable James Badge Dale) who casually says things like ""Paybacks a bitch and her stripper name is karma."" (We never learn exactly how many Imagine Dragons concerts hes been to but I assume its a lot.) Its soon clear that Rone Jack and the four other CIA security contractors based out of Americas secret Benghazi base are absolute geniuses in a war zone. In fact these men exude such a remarkable aura of competence that you grow hyperattuned to the few hints of fear that peek through their facades and can almost imagine how the White House thought them capable of holding their own against any of Libyas residual threats. Director Michael Bay Sept. 11 2015 in Deauville France. Photo by Francois Durand/Getty Images Advertisement The rest is (virulently controversial) history. U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens comes to town as part of his sincere campaign to win the hearts and minds of the Libyan people local elements are tipped off to his arrival and at approximately 940 p.m. more than 100 armed militants storm the poorly guarded compound at which Stevens has been lounging poolside.  Jack Rone and the rest of their team watch the violence erupt from their hidden base a mile down the road waiting (and waiting and waiting) for permission to launch a rescue mission. The ""stand down"" order that kept them muzzled for too long is perhaps the rawest political nerve addressed in 13 Hours which has been adapted from a Mitchell Zuckoff book of the same name and pins the blame for that blunder on the soldiers sniveling commanding officer (David Costabile who played Gale on Breaking Bad and plays a similar patsy here). When darkness falls over Benghazi and the CIA team finally does gets involved in the fray Bay submerges the film into almost 90 minutes of carefully controlled chaos. The action is never topsy-turvy enough for 13 Hours to be mistaken for a Paul Greengrass film but its also not so operatic that it feels like Bay is turning a tragedy into Bad Boys III. The most effective moments position us with Rone and Jack on the roof of the CIA compound the clarity of their sightlines allowing us to share their perspective of the attack in progress. On the other hand Bay cant help himself from dipping into his arsenal of cinematic awesomeness at one point even borrowing a trick that was gross back when he used it in Pearl Harbor. ""I want to respect the troops"" you can hear Bay saying ""but I also want to respect how hella cool it looks to see through the eyes of the mortar that kills them"" Bay doesnt always strike a solid balance between re-enactment and entertainment but his successes in that regard are pivotal. Perhaps most crucially Bay doesnt confront his heroes with a superhuman militant leader; instead he highlights a few Arabic-speaking extras and associates them with the worst of the violence. The result casts the people of Benghazi beneath a citywide veil of suspicion and the film depicts how difficult it is for them to differentiate between friendlies and hostiles. Rone and his boys are every bit as confused as we are; they see every stranger as a potential threat but are also keenly attuned to the difference between murder and self-defense. ""We dont know whos good or whos bad"" one of the American soldiers barks at one point and his words echo for long after the last bullet has been fired. Top Comment I havent trusted a Michael Bay film ever since he twisted the facts in the Transformer movies.  More... Join In Any implicit criticisms this films very existence lob at Clinton (whose name is never spoken in the film) are overshadowed by Bays explicit criticisms against the broader institutional failures of a government thats unwilling to clean up its messes--and the moral failures of a citizenry who have the gall to assume they know what went really went down. The story goes that Bays mother advised her son not to direct the film rhetorically asking him ""What do you need that headache for?"" But 13 Hours suggests that were Bays headache and that he made this movie in order to soothe his pain. The result is messy violent and a sad commentary on the state of our world. The response to the film has already been so polarized and predetermined that were probably going to be talking about it for much longer than we should. In that sense 13 Hours isnt a movie about Benghazi. 13 Hours is Benghazi. SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Pablo Schreiber from left John Krasinski and David Denman star in ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.""  (Paramount Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Privacy Policy Everything in director Michael Bays cinematic vocabulary -- the glamorizing slo-mo the falling bomb point-of-view shots the low-angle framing of his heroes with blue sky fireballs or an American flag in the background -- suggests not real life or the way things might have happened but a Michael Bay movie.Its true of the ""Transformers"" movies and its true of ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" Bays latest is a mixed-up blend of truth and distortion. Parts of it deliver a punch and a jolt and ripples of earnest (and even complicated) emotion. Then the characters some of them composites or fabrications start talking again. The cliches tumble out. And Bay gets preoccupied with delivering audience-baiting ""kill shots"" engineered to appease our bloodlust and avenge our enemies. At such moments ""13 Hours"" becomes less convincing in its interpretation of what happened Sept. 11-12 2012 when terrorists attacked two Central Intelligence Agency compounds (one official one unofficial) in Benghazi Libya. The key figures here the men who helped Mitchell Zuckoff write the account on which Bays film is based are members of the CIAs sub-contracted GRS or Global Response Staff. Six members of what was known as the Annex Security Team were hired to protect CIA staffers at the compounds.Photographed in Malta doubling for Libya ""13 Hours"" begins with the usual introductions of the six GRS security personnel soon to be under siege. John Krasinski of ""The Office"" plays Jack Silva the most amiable of the guys who has left a wife and children behind to make a living keep the adrenaline going and serve a higher cause in a dangerous place. James Badge Dale portrays the stalwart Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods a natural leader and a bullheaded adversary to the sniveling CIA base chief (David Costabile) who symbolizes everything wrong with foreign policy in Bays eyes under the Obama administration. Screenwriter Chuck Hogan (""The Town"") leaves nothing to chance as Costabiles soft-bellied Ivy League punk looks one of our protectors straight in the eye and says ""Youre not a first responder. Youre the last resort."" Such moments push ""13 Hours"" far far into movieland. But of course ""13 Hours"" is a movie and movies owe their subjects and the audience something larger than the facts. The characters refer to other films ""Black Hawk Down"" ""The Bourne Identity"" ""Tropic Thunder."" At his shrewdest Bay handles the action swiftly and well. The compound assaults; the perplexing array of Libyan militia fighters (never humanized barely dramatized) working with or against the U.S.; the physical spaces in which the battles take place and the bodies fall often video-gamer style with little poofs of red blood hitting the air after the bullets hit the targets skulls. What war movies say about us Michael Phillips Most films exist outside the realm of politics yet there is no such thing as an apolitical film. Those who claim to have made one are being strategic. Theyre worried about scaring the customers and cutting out 50 percent of the public. Clint Eastwoods ""American Sniper"" was a huge popular success... Most films exist outside the realm of politics yet there is no such thing as an apolitical film. Those who claim to have made one are being strategic. Theyre worried about scaring the customers and cutting out 50 percent of the public. Clint Eastwoods ""American Sniper"" was a huge popular success... (Michael Phillips) Some of this is slick and enjoyable in what Id characterize as the wrong way the painlessly bloody box-office-friendly way. But now and then Bay captures something more troubling and messy going on as in the weird moments of calm between the shootings when the grounds of the U.S. ambassadors rented home become crowded with dazed Libyan militia members of uncertain loyalty. And Krasinski comes through movingly in his final scenes.Fox News and other conservative outlets are all over ""13 Hours"" and judging from many early reports loving it. Early in the film PresidentObama is heard in voice-over praising ""a new and democratic Libya"" in the wake of the post-Gadhafi era. Its a ""what-an-idiot"" moment disproven immediately by a quick montage of chaos and destruction. The other off-screen villain of the movie then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will no doubt be answering question after question on the campaign trail about the films inference largely supported by the historical record that the U.S. underestimated security concerns before and after the terrorist attacks in Benghazi. Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. ""13 Hours"" says one thing -- ""You cant tell the good guys from the bad guys"" -- and shows you quite another. Bay and company have no trouble telling the good guys from the bad guys. We are only meant to care about certain deaths not the vast majority. The key characters are pencil sketches not flesh-and-blood but they serve Bays purposes as do the performances. Theyre mythic warriors not men really although their heroism was very real. Never dull ""13 Hours"" gives you a little of that and lot of what most people actually go to war movies for which is the opposite of reality.

Of course this being a Michael Bay movie there are moments when deadly battles are given the glorious slow-motion treatment and lit like fireworks displays and if you think Bays camera will linger on the American flag more than once well youve seen your share of Michael Bay movies havent you? Sporting a full beard and layers of muscle John Krasinski is nearly unrecognizable as Jack Silva the newest member of a small team of CIA contractors in Benghazi acting as security for a CIA outpost manned by about 30 operatives tracking the movement of weapons in the post-Gadhafi Libya where the situation is unstable on the best of days. (The name has been changed but Krasinskis character and the rest of the team are based on real-life former military men who fought the terrorists who stormed the American diplomatic compound on Sept. 11 and 12 in 2012.) Jack is married with two little girls with a third child on the way. (A scene in which Jack inadvertently learns the news while on a phone call with his wife who is at a drive-through at a McDonalds back home isnt exactly subtle but its effective.) In fact each of the six Annex Security Team members is a father. When theyre not risking their lives in the Middle East for country and cash they work in insurance or selling homes. Some are in Benghazi because they need the money; others are there because they are soldiers through and through and as one of them puts it warriors arent meant to retire. Although there are a few tense encounters right from the get-go with the Americans trying to figure out whos friendly and whos against them Bay and screenwriter Chuck Hogan take a comfortable amount of time establishing characters and giving us a lay of the land geographically and politically before were plunged into the nightmare of the continued assaults on the U.S. Diplomatic Compound. James Badge Dale delivers charismatic work as Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods Jacks best friend and the leader of the team. Max Martini Pablo Schreiber Dominic Fumusa and David Denman (who played Roy Jims rival for Pams affections on ""The Office"") are all believable as former Navy SEALs and Marines who comport themselves with great swagger and bravado -- and back it up when the stuff hits the fan. David Costabile is Bob who heads the CIA team. Of course Bob is a fussy arrogant desk commander who has nothing but disdain for what he calls ""security guards"" and of course Bob is indecisive and weak when gunmen storm the compound. You need a Bob in a movie like this. ""13 Hours"" isnt interested in introducing us to any of the terrorists who attack the compound or in explaining their motivation other than they want to kill Americans. When the first wave of attacks hits the building (often and unofficially referred to as the consulate) occupied by Ambassador Christopher Stevens (a well-cast Matt Letscher) the Annex men are about a mile down the road at their assigned post protecting the CIA operation. They have no authority to join the battle even though the small unit assigned to protect the ambassador is hopelessly outmanned. In fact theyre told to stand down while Bob makes some phone calls to determine when and how the U.S. can send reinforcements. Even though theyre private contractors the team members are American soldiers to the core and they refuse to stand by while countrymen are under attack. From that point forward ""13 Hours"" is one extended battle sequence after another with the consulate going up in flames harrowing chase sequences and multiple shootout scenes back at the CIA compound. The body count soars with dozens upon dozens of Libyan gunmen taken out by the Americans who suffer casualties of their own. Theres very little politicking in ""13 Hours"" other than a moment when one of the Americans notes the mortar attack had to have been planned weeks in advance. This was no spontaneous demonstration gone horribly wrong as we were initially told at the time. And of course theres an unspoken but quite loud indictment of the Obama administration and in particularly then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Not only did we not see this coming but for 13 long hours it was up to a half-dozen civilians to protect American lives. Highly trained former military to be sure but civilians nonetheless. This is no ""Zero Dark Thirty"" or ""The Hurt Locker."" Lacking in nuance and occasionally plagued by corny dialogue ""13 Hours"" is nonetheless a well-photographed visceral action film and a sincere and fitting tribute to those secret soldiers. [s3r star=3/4] Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by Michael Bay and written by Chuck Hogan. Running time 144 minutes. Rated R (for strong combat violence throughout bloody images and language).

If sheer film combat bloodshed were an antiwar commentary ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" would win the Nobel Peace Prize. Watching Michael Bays 21/2-hour exercise in machismo porn is like experiencing the death of 1000 cuts except that the hemorrhaging is inflicted by bullets and mortar fire. It turns the armed militant attack against the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi Libya on Sept. 11 2012 and the weaponized crossfire from its hired security team into an endless loop of ""The Shining"" elevators blood flood. The films limited focus is in some ways a good thing. All it looks at is the fog of war. No one in Washington is blamed for the deaths of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens State Department communications specialist Sean Smith or security operators Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods. The film doesnt dwell on complexities of U.S. foreign policy in the increasingly volatile Middle East. It doesnt pander to those still stirring controversy about the events beyond noting several lapses in security. Theres no reference to what the region might be like if the U.S. had not invaded Iraq. Bay sees the point of the story as intensely aggressively violent chaos and he delivers it almost nonstop. Adapted from the nonfiction account ""13 Hours"" by Boston University journalism professor Mitchell Zuckoff the film is a pure Special Ops genre action thriller. Bay is largely apolitical here. His attention is laser-focused on swarthy menacing natives Harvard and Yale dweebs collecting Mideast intelligence and the half-dozen professional security men fighting the barbarians at the gates. This is a classic story of 21st-century tragedy told by a guy who loves to play ""Call of Duty"" on his Xbox. Bay whose fetish for big buff dudes is boundless is much more excited about the scrappy thick-necked defense team than the CIA squad inside the compound and more interested in their brothers-in-arms camaraderie than character development. John Krasinski and James Badge Dale play a pair of the security contractors a new arrival in Libya and a veteran roughly sharing the low rank of the films protagonist. As in most action video games the characters identity is really in the eye of the player. The virile defense crew members speak tech almost exclusively and their family connections get the sort of bored faraway attention that a spy drone gives to a one-horse village. A juicier disagreeable role goes to David Costabile as the compounds CIA chief an overweight bureaucrat with the personality of a reptilian vampire. Matt Letscher as the visiting Ambassador Stevens offers a respectful presentation of a good diplomat trying to piece together the rapidly disintegrating map of the Middle East but its little more than a walk-on part. As Krasinskis inexperienced Libyan bodyguard quickly learns its a place where people unable to tell enemies from allies will not be viable long-term. Everyone there has loaded weapons demands American cash and speaks gibberish. Quoting Joseph Campbells ""The Power of Myth"" one of the security crew offers the insight that life is an endless learning experience ""All the gods all the heavens all the hells are within you."" Its a sentence others repeat twice between scenes where forearms are blown apart with visual snap bodies are bisected and fallen bodies are run over by speeding cars in close-up. 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi  out of 4 stars Rating R for strong combat violence throughout bloody images and language. In English and Arabic. In the right hands a battle film can make seemingly accidental events like those into a sort of consistent order or cosmic plan. Here the carnage seems of so little moment -- until matched scenes at the end showing locals weeping over their fallen militia and 100000 of Libyas 6 million citizens taking to the streets to condemn the attack -- that the horror scarcely matters. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan January 14 From Michael Bay and Paramount comes ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" in theaters January 15 2016. (  / Paramount Pictures) ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" takes as its subject the 2012 attacks on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi Libya and a nearby CIA station that left American Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others dead. Based on Mitchell Zuckoffs 2014 book -- which was written in collaboration with five surviving members of the CIAs security team and which includes some disputed versions of events -- it thankfully avoids politicizing the episode for which Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton then serving as secretary of state has been pilloried by conservatives for allegedly ignoring requests to fortify the consulates defenses before the attack. As an action film it is intense and gripping. As a drama it is bombastic and unsubtle. Despite a vague reference to budget cuts Clinton is never mentioned in the movie. If theres a villain -- other than the Libyan attackers who were members of the Ansar al-Sharia militia -- its the anonymous CIA station chief (David Costabile) who is only called ""Bob"" in the book and whom the film refers to exclusively as ""Chief."" Unflatteringly portrayed as effete and prissy Chief is disdained by the macho no-nonsense security contractors because in this rendition he orders them to ""stand down"" for nearly 30 minutes while the consulate is initially under attack. (A congressional committee investigating the incident found no evidence of intentional obstruction by the CIA chief yet hes clearly a roadblock in the film. Feel free to boo and hiss. Its cathartic.) If the underlying text of ""13 Hours"" is Zuckoffs book its more pertinent scripture is the Gospel according to Michael Bay. The director and producer of the ""Transformers"" franchise (as well as ""Armageddon"" ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Pain amp; Gain"") Bay seemingly cant help but make a movie that is loud brash nuance-free and more glandular than cerebral. ""13 Hours"" is a movie that stimulates the production of adrenaline not insight. ""American Sniper"" for all its flag-waving was a deeper film. A CIA security team -- including from left Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto (Pablo Schreiber) Jack Silva (John Krasinski) Dave ""Boon"" Benton (David Denman) and John ""Tig"" Tiegen (Dominic Fumusa) -- battles back in the explosive ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" (Paramount Pictures) Working from a black-and-white script by Chuck Hogan (FXs ""The Strain"") Bay has put his stamp all over ""13 Hours."" As exhausting as it is pulse-pounding the nearly 2 1/2 -hour film plays at times like a first-person-shooter video game with extended sequences featuring the six main characters blowing away faceless bad guys often shown as tiny black silhouettes creeping across night-vision goggles. Theyre mostly referred to as ""tangos"" military slang for ""targets."" At one point Bays camera follows a flying mortar shell as it arcs through the air. Add an on-screen body count and youd have ""Call of Duty Benghazi."" Speaking of which Bay keeps track of the time via a digital timer that pops up every few minutes in the lower left-hand corner of the screen. The countdown clock is unnecessary and kind of annoying. Otherwise ""13 Hours"" moves briskly for the most part. The movie centers on six CIA security operators played by John Krasinski (Jack Silva); James Badge Dale (Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods); Pablo Schreiber (Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto); David Denman (Dave ""Boon"" Denton); Dominic Fumusa (John ""Tig"" Tiegen); and Max Martini (Mark ""Oz"" Geist). Other than the pseudonymous Jack and Boon the other four characters names are real. Despite a superficial effort to delineate the individual attributes of these men -- a brand of movie humanization that comes courtesy of the occasional flashback phone call home or lingering glance at a family photo -- ""13 Hours"" is able to spare only a few moments on character development. I got more of a sense of who these ""secret soldiers"" were as people by watching a clip of Foxs Megyn Kelly interviewing some of them on television shortly before the movie came out. One thing is never in doubt whether in the book in the movie or in real life These men are heroes. As ""13 Hours"" makes vividly even viscerally clear the firefight in Benghazi was a nightmare of confusion and chaos in which the Ansar al-Sharia bad guys were indistinguishable from the Libyan good guys (members of the Feb. 17 Martyrs Brigade militia referred to as ""Feb 17"" in the film whom the U.S. called on for assistance during the attacks). The film rightly honors them. Weirdly Paronto told Kelly in that TV interview that he missed the rush and brotherhood of that hellish night in Benghazi saying that he would go back there ""in a heartbeat"" if he could. Its both a credit to the film and a criticism that ""13 Hours"" is just enough of an entertainment to show us why someone might feel that way. R. At area theaters.

Photo Christian Black/Paramount Pictur McClatchy-Tribune News Service 13 Hours a long and dispiriting war movie 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Give director Michael Bay credit for making an action movie about a real event in the recent past. Give him still more credit for daring to make in ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" a war movie that doesnt go well for the good guys. That still leaves the question ""Why should anybody want to see this?"" ""13 Hours"" is something rare a feel-bad war movie. It has the structure of a typical war picture -- it concerns itself with a struggle against great odds against an invading force. In that way its something like another Bay film ""Pearl Harbor"" except that we know how World War II worked out. We could take some consolation from that. Here the only consolation offered is that were it not for some genuine heroism things might have gone even worse that night. Still this is a film about an evacuation and as Winston Churchill said after Dunkirk ""Wars are not won by evacuations."" Neither are audiences. All the same if you want to see a reasonably well-made two-hour-and-24-minute dramatization of the events that took place in Libya on Sept. 11-12 2012 this is the movie to see. Youre all but guaranteed to walk out feeling bad about what happened that day -- and about what has happened since -- and youll wonder why more couldnt have been done to protect American lives there. But you will at least feel admiration for the handful of men whose courage and military skill allowed them to survive and save others. These men belonged to the GRS and if youve never heard of the Global Response Staff well thats why the subtitle about ""secret soldiers."" Apparently the GRS which is made up of former special-ops guys is the security muscle behind the Central Intelligence Agency. They protect operatives in the field. In Benghazi six of them happened to be at a CIA compound about a mile away from the temporary embassy that was inhabited by the American ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens. When things started going wrong at the embassy they volunteered to go there. ""13 Hours"" uses the real names of these secret soldiers and like so many movies about true events the people are presented as almost too good to be true -- too genial too heroic too loving too altogether wonderful. This is certainly true in the depiction of Jack Silva (John Krasinski) as a family man who cant wait to go home. (This is not to say these arent and werent great guys just that the movie lays it on a little thick.) Screenwriter Chuck Hogan seems intent that viewers love everybody before the battles start. The audience certainly develops a warm feeling for Stevens (Matt Letscher) presented as decent and idealistic the sort of person you would want representing your country overseas. Watching the film though one cant help feel a pang of sympathy for his family which must endure the existence of a film that realizes in chilling detail the agonizing terror leading up to his murder. Bay has a penchant for moving the camera for shaking it and for cutting quickly and the result is that the battles are often hard to follow moment by moment. Complicating matters is that most of the fighting takes place at night and that almost every fighter including the Americans has a beard. On these occasions the drama drops out spectacle takes over and the movie begins to seem as long as it is. But at it best ""13 Hours"" captures the profound strangeness of being a fish out of water. The GRS men cant tell the good Libyans from the bad ones. When a shepherd grazes his sheep in the middle of the night the guys dont know if this is a ruse or if this is how its done in the sheep business. At every turn theyre forced to confront their utter dislocation and not in a way thats fodder for vacation anecdotes. One wrong judgment either way and they might kill a completely innocent person or end up dead themselves. So this is an odd movie to talk about. Its long downright dispiriting enjoyable only sometimes and yet theres a feeling of authenticity. Its neither bad nor good but interesting. It might improve with age.

Share Tweet ""Downtimes the worst; the adrenaline leaves and my mind just starts to wander"" says CIA security contractor Jack Silva (John Krasinski) about two-thirds of the way through 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers Of Benghazi inadvertently summing up whats wrong with Michael Bays latest a cool 90-minute action flick padded out into a lumbering ooh-rah male weepie. Overlong and at times ponderous and prone to a slobs vs. snobs mentality that pits prissy CIA agents against the mens men on their payroll 13 Hours is also in stretches about as pure an action movie as Bay is likely to make. Its lengthy siege and chase set pieces combine Bays usual pomp (e.g. the arc of a mortar shell followed from loading to impact) with wild smeared very digital camerawork of the kind that cinematographer Dion Beebe previously pulled off for Michael Mann on Collateral and Miami Vice. Packed with misfiring grenade launchers blue lens flares and Mercedes armored cars 13 Hours makes the best case for Bay as a toy-box aesthete with an abstract sense of motion and color--and the best case against him as an incoherent jingoism fetishist. Bay is a hyperactive stylist whose idea of a personal project involves imitating other more thoughtful films about machismo. Pain amp; Gain about the exploits of a real-life gang of extortionist bodybuilders aped Casino-era Scorsese (multiple narrators Rolling Stones coked-up violence etc.) and 13 Hours at times feels like Bays take on Mann with plenty of jargon and clipped tough-guy emoting and a whole cast of professionals who dont fit in with the straight world. The director hasnt put this much stock in the audience giving a damn about characters since Pearl Harbor but while 13 Hours is a somewhat better brothers-in-arms movie than the earlier film was a romance thats not saying much. Posturing so hard that he probably threw out his back during production Bay waves scorched American flags and takes swipes at the elitism of Harvard and Yale. (Bay himself went to Wesleyan so maybe its personal.) On an ideological level the movie is an ode to doing it for the money; in Bays brand of filmmaking theres nothing more American. Adapted by novelist Chuck Hogan from the same-titled book by Mitchell Zuckoff 13 Hours depicts the 2012 attack on a diplomatic compound in Libya and a nearby secret CIA base mostly from the point of the view of a six-man team of contractors who worked at the latter. They are all family men former Navy SEALs and Army Rangers drawn back into conflict zones because theyre broke. At home Silva is a realtor ""Tonto"" (Pablo Schreiber) is an insurance claims adjuster ""Rone"" (James Badge Dale) is a nurse and so on and so forth. In Benghazi though theyre ripped and bearded bodyguards who show each other pictures of their kids and then kick ass. 13 Hours is slow to get going and interminable in its final stretch and its politics are bogus at best; perhaps the point is to put audiences in the mindset of the eye-rolling adrenaline-junkie secretly hoping that another Toyota Hilux will round the corner so that one of the contractors can say ""Are we expecting friendlies?"" into his walkie and all hell can break loose. (Note This exchange happens enough times in 13 Hours to make for a drinking game.)But does anyone go to a Michael Bay movie for the talk? Because whenever the bloviating stops and the gunfire starts 13 Hours cuts loose with some of the most adventurous filmmaking of Bays career. Shooting entirely in digital formats for the first time Bay plays with the out-there end of aesthetics mixing 360-degree shutter angles (what most folks think of as the ""video look"") with more conventionally filmic footage and disorienting close-ups with floating aerial vistas shot by camera drones. Smoke sweat and bulletproof glass swirl in a tense nighttime car chase that borders on visual music composed for Bays preferred ensemble of explosions and solo luxury motor vehicle. Rocket-propelled grenades bounce off pavement like fireworks and cars are ripped apart into twisted metal debris suggesting an urban firefight re-imagined as elaborate kinetic sculpture. But then comes the downtime bringing with it a parade of cartoonish stuffed shirts and pretentious CIA agents lots of forced misty eye and a phony take on American can-do.

Bay is best when bullets fly but thats no surprise.""13 Hours Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" tells the story of the non-military security team who fought during the now-famous attack on a U.S. Embassy in Libya.(Photo Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 stars out of 5The politics are not explicit and neither Hillary Clinton nor President Obama are mentionedThe action scenes are tense if sometimes chaotic though that is probably by designFirst lets talk about the cinematic worthiness of ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.""But the politics wont wait for long.Michael Bay best known for directing the ""Transformers"" franchise would not seem to be the ideal choice for a film about a sensitive political topic whose impact still resonates and may play a major role in the presidential election.But in some ways hes not a bad fit. No one has ever accused Bay of not being able to blow things up in impressive fashion. Its just that usually those explosions involve alien robot-like creatures that can turn into cars.The explosions in this film are serious. Deadly serious. The film is based on the book ""13 Hours"" by Mitchell Zuckoff and it tells the story of the raid on a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Libya in 2012 and then on a CIA annex nearby. And while it is very much the story of six veterans working as private contractors assigned to the annex but eager to help out when the compound is overrun it cannot by virtue of the subject matter avoid politics completely.Or maybe its the rest of us who cant.Jack Silva (John Krasinski playing against his usual puppy-dog persona) is one of the contractors. He leaves his wife and children at home as well as his insurance business and meets up with old brothers in arms and new ones. Bob (David Costabile) the base chief says theres nothing much going on in Benghazi but Bay goes to great lengths to show that Bob is ineffectual and wrong.Bay is heavy-handed with character development but at least for Silva (the name has been changed) its there. For the rest of the Americans its mostly calls home to adorable children.Its when bullets fly that Bay is at his best. He stages the battles well and builds tension effectively and at times inventively. At one point we see the flight of an explosive from the explosives point of view. The fighting is at times hard to follow but thats doubtless intentional. ""Does it seem like everybody knows whats going on here but us?"" one operator screams in frustration.John Krasinski (""The Office""_ takes on a very different role in ""13 Hours Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" (Photo Paramount Pictures)No ""13 Hours"" says. Thats the problem. No one knew what was going on and thats what led to disaster.Certainly this is not the first war movie in which brave warriors must overcome the ineptness of their superiors to fight the good fight.Bays film is however the one with the greatest political stakes. The attacks remain a hot-button issue for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton who was secretary of state at the time. Bay has said he didnt want to make a political film and neither Clinton nor President Obama are mentioned (except for a quick aside in which a character said the president is being briefed).But we do see Americans frantically asking for air support then cut to pilots standing by idle planes in Tripoli. The chief of base operations at the CIA annex with gallows humor jokingly says the Libyan government must have gone home for the night; he cant reach them for help.AZCENTRAL13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes Reviews""What about ours?"" another man asks. ""They pick up the phone?""When a Libyan transport arrives after the fighting someone says ""Still no Americans.""And most damningly when private contractors beg the chief to let them help out Americans under attack he issues the order ""Stand down.""This will be at the heart of the controversy over the film. The administration says no such order was given and a Republican-led congressional committee agreed. Those in Zuckoffs book -- the contractors at the heart of the film -- say it was.AZCENTRAL2016 movie guide A preview of films opening January-AprilWhether it was the chiefs decision or someone elses isnt clear in the movie -- chaos makes communication iffy at best. But there is no question that Clintons opponents wont have to work too hard to find fodder for criticizing her.Not that this has been a problem for them before.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

VPCJohn Krasinski stars as an ex-military security contractor in 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.(Photo Christian Black)While security lapses congressional hearings and Hillary Clintons email might have been a major part of the narrative Americans heard about the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi Libya that would equal a really boring movie. And Michael Bay doesnt do really boring movies.Instead the director focuses on the people who were literally in the line of fire on that fateful Libyan night in 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi (1/2 out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Friday) a tense though overly-long action thriller that makes no mistake about whose side its on when choosing between ex-military contractors and government bureaucracy. (Note Not the CIAs.)USA TODAYJohn Krasinski goes full-on warrior for 13 HoursThe film focuses on Jack Silva (John Krasinski) a former Navy SEAL who puts his family life on hold for a tour of duty in Libya as part of a six-man security crew on a covert CIA base in Benghazi which in the post-Moammar Gadhafi era has turned into one of the most dangerous places on the planet.Its Zero Bro Thirty normally in their diplomatic annex where the guys play video games and read Joseph Campbell when theyre not on missions. Just weeks before going home an explosive situation arises when the nearby compound of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens (Matt Letscher) is attacked by Islamic militants on the anniversary of 9/11. Tensions are fiery when the arrogant CIA base chief (David Costabile) wont let Rone (James Badge Dale) Jack and their squad leave the grounds to help. Soon enough though they have to race back to the annex where the militants have turned their attention for a series of increasingly deadly assaults.USA TODAYTransformers Michael Bay to direct his fifth and final filmAs the violence gets hairier for the main heroes Bay keeps the camera trained on the gore and carnage of war but also the wear and tear on the mens psyches. The film focuses on a central problem of Middle East conflict which is the fine line between Libyan allies and enemies. ""Theyre all bad guys till theyre not"" is one wise warfare statement by a former Army Ranger named Tanto (Pablo Schreiber).Chuck Hogans adaptation of Mitchell Zuckoffs book shies away from being overly political yet leans into the federal buffoonery encountered by the main characters. At the same time the screenplay misses a chance to dig into some of the behind-the-scenes breakdowns that made headlines.USA TODAYHeres why John Krasinski and Emily Blunt are the baddest couple aliveKrasinski might be the stoic brains of the operation but Dale and especially Schreiber (of Orange is the New Black fame) are the heart as the most watchable of the films former soldiers. The latters Tanto tries to keep up his macho swagger but even he is ultimately overcome with the emotion of being an unsung hero.After a string of iffy Transformers movies Bay reminds that he can do a much better action movie with humans than alien robots 13 Hours is his best work in the genre since his 1990s hits Bad Boys and The Rock. For those who appreciate his slo-mos hero shots and ""missile-eye view"" Bay is not shy about borrowing from himself for this mortar-shelled and sometimes moving true story. 426 CONNECTTWEET 11 LINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1RnpKTp",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/01/14/review-13-hours-secret-soldiers-of-benghazi/78727054/,200,13hoursthesecretsoldiersofbenghazi30,13hoursthesecretsoldiersofbenghazi,usatoday

(Credit Dion Beebe) Movie review of ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" Michael Bays dramatization is a ground-level depiction of heroism in the fog of war. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer Friend? Or foe? Those are the critical questions bedeviling the six main characters in ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" Strangers in a strange land unable to speak or understand Arabic assigned to provide security at a secret CIA installation in the restive Libyan city of the title -- for them those questions have life and death implications when the nearby ambassadorial compound is overrun by jihadist attackers on the night of Sept. 11 2012. The assault claims the lives of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Movie Review    13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi with James Badge Dale Pablo Schreiber Max Martini John Krasinski Dominic Fumusa David Denman David Costabile. Directed by Michael Bay from a screenplay by Chuck Hogan based on a book by Mitchell Zuckoff. 144 minutes. Rated R for strong combat violence throughout bloody images and language. Several theaters. In Michael Bays gripping dramatization of that controversial event the men highly trained American private security operatives cant be sure if the figures they see moving toward them in the dark are jihadists or friendly Libyan militia members who are supposed to be the main protectors of the compound. The loyalty of those supposed allies is also questionable. Its only when the shooting starts that the questions are answered and then the six are in for the fight of their lives.

Based on Mitchell Zuckoffs 2014 best-seller ""13 Hours"" Bays movie is a ground-level depiction of heroism in the midst of the fog of war. Hewing closely to Zuckoffs true-life account Bay seems to have no political ax to grind at least with respect to the role in the fiasco of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton whose name is never mentioned. Rather its bureaucracy that is as much of a villain as the anonymous jihadists. Its symbolized by Bob (David Costabile) the CIA station chief whose pre-raid scorn of the operatives -- ""hired help"" he calls them -- leads him to dither bluster and refuse to allow them to go to the ambassadors aid until its too late. The movies main drawback is that its main characters are surprisingly ill-defined. Played by John Krasinski James Badge Dale Pablo Schreiber Max Martini Dominic Fumusa and David Denman theyre all elite ex-military men highly skilled at their deadly profession. But though their acting is uniformly first-rate the characters bearded faces and lack of distinctive personality traits make them difficult to tell apart. Its a frustrating flaw in an otherwise engrossing picture. Soren Andersen 206-464-2358 or sandersenseattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights delivered weekday mornings.

The filmmakers and their supporters typically hit back with the argument that there was never a mandate for complete factual accuracy--that would be a documentary--and as long as the spirit of those portrayed on screen is accurately captured and viewers are not grossly misled theres no real harm being done. Its just a movie. In that sense 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi is unique because its not just a movie. Its a Michael Bay movie. As is the trend for the last decade the new film starring John Krasinski and James Badge Dale is a quick look back over the shoulder of history this time back to September 11 2012 when Islamist militia members laid siege to a U.S. diplomatic outpost in Libya and killed four Americans.13 Hours is the story of the GRS or the Global Response Staff the CIA contractors hired to guard the intelligence agencys annex one mile from the compound. Krasinski plays Jack Silva a former Marine who arrives in Benghazi days before the attack to join Tyrone Wood (Dale) and his team of badasses. And the men of the GRS in 13 Hours arent simply badasses in the sense that anyone who volunteers to protect our country is inherently a badass. These guys are badasses from Michael Bays Alpha Male Signature Series Collection(tm). They gear up in montages and understand the irony of saying ""Welcome to Benghazi"" after a tense standoff. Their rides are dope (a stolen Mercerdes Benz fleet) and their many adorable children back home shout the names of their favorite brands over the phone (McDonalds). Their massive muscles are sculpted by flipping truck tires practically in the nude but they still make time to read passages from Joseph Campbells The Power of Myth aloud just in case the quote will become thematically relevant for another character in the third act. But most importantly--and this is where things get murky--the gut instincts of the GRS members are always right and they dont need an Ivy League education to know whats what. Its in this regard that 13 Hours crosses the threshold between just being a Michael Bay movie and being a Michael Bay movie that has something to say and its message is guaranteed to garner reactions from both sides of the political equation. The characters plainly state that if the ineffectual and not-at-all-swole head of the CIA annex in Benghazi (played by the guy who was Walter Whites nerdy assistant on Breaking Bad no less) had let the GRS do their job Ambassador Chris Stevens and US Foreign Service officer Sean Smith would not have died. The sentiment comes straight from Mitchell Zuckoffs book the films source material but Bay whose preferred medium is ""paintball on nerd"" rather than ""oil on canvas"" has never been good with subtlety. The films penchant for taking potshots at the CIA feels in part like a direct response to Zero Dark Thirty. But strictly in terms of whats on the screen the mixture of politics and pop filmmaking is a confusing distraction from what is otherwise one of Bays better efforts. His action is still geographically confused but Bay works best with chaos. Theres no shortage of that here. Its getting from fire fight to fire fight thats the problem lending the film a video game-like structure that grows repetitive in the back half. In the moments that Krasinski is allowed to act he proves that we should be seeing more of him than we currently are and Dale makes the case that hes more than an electric character actor. 13 Hours is a history lesson as Call of Duty DLC expansion pack. Theres a real story of American heroism somewhere in here but its diluted by Bays worst tendencies. You can see practically see a filmmaker wanting to legitimize himself but its kind of hard to take him seriously when there are bullets draped around the one characters neck an American flag floating in the pool and you definitely recognize an exact copy of Pearl Harbors most memorable shot.

That many of the ""Benghazi Benghazi Benghazi"" whoopers couldnt find Libya on a map didnt matter. They had a House with the votes to convene yet another committee to grill Clinton before the cameras and find nothing actionable. They had right-wing TV and radio. And now they have a movie. They might be disappointed insofar as Michael Bays 13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi doesnt mention Clinton and barely alludes to the president who at one point is said to have been briefed on the unfolding horror. But they have something almost as useful a ham-handed but grueling and often effective portrait of men forced to fight a near-impossible battle martyrs to government incompetence and Muslim extremists men who show bravery and skill and supreme grace under fire. The film is told almost completely from the vantage of these ex-military contractors hired to work for the CIA not the U.S. ambassador. That leads to some confusion. Despite a long long pre-credit title crawl purporting to explain the U.S. presence in Libya 13 Hours never makes it clear enough that the secret CIA base had no official connection to the ambassadors residence. Early on some of the contractors pay a visit to that residence and predict that its so poorly defended that any attack would be a slaughter. They find the security detail -- half-awake Libyans plus two guys (played by Demetrius Grosse and David Giuntoli) with finicky mustaches (as opposed to their own bushy beards) -- out of their depth. Every word they utter in the course of the movie is shown to be right of course. Its a two-hour ""I told you so."" The lead actors -- John Krasinski as Jack Silva (a pseudonym) James Badge Dale as Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods Pablo Schreiber as Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto David Denman as Dave ""Boon"" Benton Dominic Fumusa as John ""Tig"" Tiegen and Max Martini as Mark ""Oz"" Geist -- are intense as all get-out although I confess that big-bearded muscled-up white male actors of a certain age with similar acting styles look alike to me especially in front of Dion Beebes jittery handheld camera. Krasinski is easier to spot given his black hair and distinctive nose. Hes the one who has just arrived and is puzzled by his own presence. Its just that you see he cant quit war despite the pleadings of his wife and the tender longing of his beautiful little daughters to whom he talks often. (""Daddy what do you do when go to work?"") Damned if there wasnt a screw-up and his life insurance has lapsed -- a broad stroke but nothing compared to Denmans reading aloud from Joseph Campbells The Heros Journey. We hear Campbells description of a hero twice more. Its tough being a movie hero these days. Used to be you went out and did heroic stuff. Now you have to deconstruct it too. David Costabile best known as Gale in Breaking Bad and now the go-to actor for prissy-bitch bureaucrats is the CIA base chief -- the non-terrorist villain. He tells the skeptical Roe and Silva and Tanto ""Youre not CIA youre hired help. Act the part."" He goes on to say that the people calling the shots went to Harvard and Yale. Gosh Harvard and Yale. Following a car chase one of the contractors tells a CIA agent ""I might not have gone to Harvard but Im pretty sure that was a tail"" Its that CIA base chief who refuses to let our heroes head to the ambassadors residence at the first and even second and third sign of an attack claiming that its the Libyans jurisdiction. The account has been challenged by anonymous government officials but the movie doubles down. Our heroes finally have to show insubordination to leave the base -- but of course arrive at the ambassadors residence too late. How are the Libyans portrayed? Not well. Theyre certainly not grateful for the U.S. help in liberating them from Gaddafis tyranny. At best theyre an enigma. At second best theyre cowards -- like the police who take off just before the attacks presumably having been warned to amscray. At worst theyre faceless ""zombies"" bearing weapons who melt out of the smoke and darkness -- and on whom the contractors cant fire at first for fear of killing ""friendlies."" Thats the scariest part when they just dont know whos a friend or foe and the base chief on the walkie-talkie cant tell them. In those moments you understand that these men arent just forced to take terrifying physical risks but emotional and psychological ones. A wrong choice could lead to their deaths or to prison for killing an ally or civilian. (No mention is made of the moral horror of taking the life of an innocent person though.) Bay and cinematographer Beebe deliver some brilliant images the light is a mix of soft blues and hard slashing yellows and oranges from fires and explosions. But those images dont always cut together and its hard to get a sense of where everything is in relation to everything else. The battle scenes are loud and jangly and dissonant enough to unnerve you -- they work. But Id like to see a congressional committee grill Bay and screenwriter Chuck Hogan about whats going on half the time. One moment we hear that U.S. planes are leaving Croatia and then we hear nothing and you cant always tell if its the fog of war or the fog of Michael Bay or both. Hogan wrote The Town and some more-than-decent thriller novels. Id like to think he had nothing to do with the signature Bay overkill shot of a photo of a characters wife and child that after a mortar hit flutters in front of the camera like a falling leaf. What does 13 Hours tell us? That in the view of its protagonists the Benghazi attack was planned weeks in advance and had little to do with the stupid anti-Muslim movie that popped up on YouTube. But the Obama administration copped to getting that wrong once its own investigative committee did its job -- a long time ago. The film says the CIA the State Department and the Pentagon are perilously uncoordinated -- big news. It says incredibly brave and good men (including the naively idealistic ambassador) lost their lives because a group of officials didnt act quickly enough -- incomprehensibly awful even if it pales beside such criminal blunders as the occupation of Iraq and for that matter the failure to act in the face of innumerable warnings prior to September 11 2001. In any case 13 Hours has dropped. Now we have to wait for the fallout.

""I feel like Im in a f--ing horror movie"" a soldier murmurs as gunfire erupts around him and his words turn out to be a pretty accurate assessment of Michael Bays noisy nerve-frying account of the widely contested 2012 terrorist attacks that claimed four American lives in Benghazi Libya. Taking a break from the cultural atrocities of the ""Transformers"" franchise with this half-successful bid for seriousness Bay approaches his tinderbox of a subject pretty much the way youd expect from Hollywoods most aggressively pro-military director Largely avoiding the political firestorm in favor of a harrowing minute-by-minute procedural ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" is an experiential tour de force but a contextual blur a shrewdly dumb movie that captures and perhaps too readily embraces the extreme confusion of the events as they unfolded on the ground. Most of all its a tribute to the brave U.S. fighters who kept a horrific situation from turning much worse and its on that support-our-troops score -- which propelled ""American Sniper"" and ""Lone Survivor"" to surprise-hit status -- that this Paramount release will have its best shot at connecting with war-weary domestic audiences beyond Bays fan base. Adapted by author and first-time feature scribe Chuck Hogan from Mitchell Zuckoffs 2014 book (which was written with the surviving members of the Annex Security Team in Benghazi) ""13 Hours"" has already been described by Bay as his ""most real movie."" As a dramatization of a deadly real-life ambush on U.S. forces its certainly an improvement on say ""Pearl Harbor"" even if it shares with that 2001 misfire a scene shot from the inhuman p.o.v. of a falling rocket. Indeed many of Bays tics and tendencies are on worrying display even in the storys opening stretch in the fall of 2012 Less than a year after the fall of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi tensions are running higher than ever in the perpetually war-torn port city of Benghazi and ""13 Hours"" immediately thrusts us into the mayhem with hard-slamming edits and angry agitated camerawork. The context may be a foreign one but the muscular visual language is pure Bay; even a tense early standoff between two Americans and a Libyan militia has all the jacked-up macho swagger of a ""Bad Boys"" meet-cute. The two Americans are former Navy SEALs and old friends Jack Silva (John Krasinski) and Tyrone ""Rone"" Woods (James Badge Dale) private security contractors who have been tapped as part of the CIAs Global Response Staff to protect U.S. intelligence operatives and diplomats in the city. The other ex-military men serving with the GRS in Benghazi are Mark ""Oz"" Geist (Max Martini) Kris ""Tanto"" Paronto (Pablo Schreiber) John ""Tig"" Tiegen (Dominic Fumusa) and Dave ""Boon"" Benton (David Denman) and while they are given only minimal character shadings -- Boon is the bookish one Tanto the frat boy Silva the skilled newcomer Rone the natural leader -- the movie neatly limns the difficult personal circumstances that brought each of these men to this God-forsaken outpost with Krasinski and Dale providing a sturdy dramatic anchor throughout. Much as they long to return home to their wives and children (as captured in a few gooey flashbacks and video-chat montages) these men are born soldiers trained to respond to sudden danger with quick-thinking professionalism and unflinching courage. Due to the unrest that has held sway in the region for centuries (only recent events are described in the opening titles) there are plenty of opportunities for bravery even before Islamic militants attack the U.S. diplomatic compound on Sept. 11 penetrating the buildings formidable defenses and setting a fire that will ultimately claim the lives of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens (Matt Letscher) and Foreign Service information management officer Sean Smith (Christopher Dingli). Meanwhile at the CIAs Annex a mile away Rone and his men are ready to respond but are ordered to wait in their vehicles by ""Bob"" (David Costabile) the top Agency officer in Benghazi which almost certainly keeps them from reaching Stevens and Smith in time. That delay was the most damning and controversial revelation in Zuckoffs book and Bay never one to prioritize thought over action offers a fairly blunt indictment of the bureaucratic thumb twiddling that kept a few good men from saving American lives. Wisely this is about as far as ""13 Hours"" goes in pointing the finger of blame. There are a few vague nods to the lack of adequate security preparation and response the reliance on unarmed Libyan guards who quickly fled their posts the realization that the Annexs location isnt nearly as classified as originally thought and the grim discovery that the attacks were not spontaneous but premeditated. Still the movie generally avoids trafficking in the conspiracy theories and partisan agendas that have turned the word ""Benghazi"" into a conservative battle cry against the Obama administration and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Whether due to lack of time or inclination (or perhaps the realization that the much-disputed Benghazi narrative calls for greater political nuance than ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"") Bay seems to have determined that simply dramatizing the details of the attack will be challenge enough. Its a challenge he accepts but doesnt always rise to meet amid the frenzy of an unrelenting combat sequence that consumes most of the films 144-minute running time. Still under the circumstances that lack of clarity feels both deliberate and at times appropriate. Bay has a genius for incoherence and this is one historic crisis that feels uniquely suited to his dubious talents As the GRS soldiers make their way to the diplomatic compound and then back to the Annex taking and dispensing heavy fire along the way ""13 Hours"" all but revels in its own inscrutability. The men never know whether the Libyans approaching their compound or stopping their car might be hostiles or ""friendlies"" and their unease is only exacerbated by lousy communication with U.S. forces back home and at another key base in Tripoli (400 miles away from Benghazi). Scene after scene the movie is an exhausting pulverizing thing to experience by turns immersive and continually disruptive. Every element of the filmmaking -- from the jittery rapid-fire cutting to the intensely saturated hues of Dion Beebes digital lensing from the cacophonous bullet-riddled sound design to Lorne Balfes equally percussive score -- seems to push us out and pull us in with the same hectoring force. Its a nail-biter and a head-scratcher rolled into one The mind may initially race to keep up with logistics but eventually one acknowledges the futility of trying to make sense of a situation that Bay himself hasnt managed to clarify. Really its best to let ""13 Hours"" come at you like a piece of hyperkinetic abstract art drenched in diesel blood and testosterone. Beebe doing his most striking handheld work since Michael Manns ""Collateral"" and ""Miami Vice"" captures images of staggering brutality but theres an eerie seductiveness to his palette as well from the regular use of night-vision footage to the sight of this still-beautiful beach city (played by a mix of locations in Morocco and Malta) lit up by fires and flares. Heroes and villains register as indistinct dirt-caked blurs and the orders and threats they bark at one another soon blend into an unintelligible background drone the music of murder and military jargon. To pause and think seriously about the situation at hand would short-circuit the overwhelming sensory effect that Bay and his collaborators are aiming for. It would also require a screenplay with a deeper understanding of the politics at hand (including the U.S. own murky role in the proceedings) and a willingness to put a more human face on the enemy. The aforementioned ""American Sniper"" and ""Lone Survivor"" also limited themselves to a soldiers perspective but they still invested their respective Middle East conflicts with more complexity and empathy than ""13 Hours"" extends to the Benghazi attackers; a visually striking scene of hijab-clad mothers mourning their fallen militants doesnt really cut it. Other characters do occasionally register amid the tumult The terrific Iranian actor Peyman Moaadi (""A Separation"") turns up as a friendly Libyan aide caught up in the horror while French actress Alexia Barlier plays a defiant CIA operative whose chief narrative purpose is to exalt the heroics of those protecting her. As one man rather needlessly points out during a moment of anxious downtime Benghazi is essentially a 21st-century Alamo and those are the sobering reductive terms on which Bays movie presents itself. Its no spoiler to note that two GRS soldiers -- Rone and Glen Doherty (Toby Stephens) who arrived from his base in Tripoli on the morning of Sept. 12 -- will soon perish in a mortar attack on the roof of the Annex. Their deaths and the astonishing courage of their comrades confer upon the GRS a nobility that is ambiguous and beyond reproach and ""13 Hours"" solicits easy admiration by paying stolid moving tribute to their sacrifice. Bays more generous critics may feel similarly inclined to honor a job well done. He may not have made a remotely great or definitive movie about Benghazi but hes surely earned a few points for good behavior.

Gary Dubois says March 7 2016 at 1057 am obviously you are not a veteran just a scrub Reply jsm1963 says February 22 2016 at 1045 am I guess you told him. Reply Ambrose Zera Cook-Saloway says February 5 2016 at 727 pm Honestly This Review is awful. You go into a movie and are mad that the movie is exactly what it is supposed to be and was advertised to be. Just in the first paragraph you specifically you criticize him for ""Largely avoiding the political firestorm in favor of a harrowing minute-by-minute procedural"" ""a shrewdly dumb movie that captures and perhaps too readily embraces the extreme confusion of the events as they unfolded on the ground."" and ""its a tribute to the brave U.S. fighters who kept a horrific situation from turning much worse"" Whats next are you gonna do a review about how 10 Cloverfield Lane wasnt Much of a Rom-Com? You shouldnt base your review on a movie because you dont like the genre of movie it is. I dont think you deserve to be a critic. Reply jsm1963 says February 6 2016 at 1042 am Difference being that 10 Cloverfield Lane is a total work of fiction. This is supposed to be based on real events. Reply Ambrose Zera Cook-Saloway says February 7 2016 at 1230 am 10 Cloverfield Lane being a work of complete fiction where as 13 hours wasnt doesnt negate anything I said. 13 Hours was clearly supposed to be an Action movie and the reviewer is bummed that it was. Also it seems you are implying the movie was supposed to be accurate or realistic but the movie clearly wasnt supposed to be that or we would have just got a documentary not an action movie. jsm1963 says February 7 2016 at 952 am Go to their official website. The first thing that comes up (as the site loads) is ""The true story of 6 men who had the courage to fight back."" Blame the filmmakers for hyping as a true story. John Studley says February 6 2016 at 713 pm The Movie was dynamic in its direction and first rate in the telling of a big story full of actual heros. The acting left nothing behind and is first rate and the emotions conveyed raw and unapologetic. Reviewers that let their political bias drain their ethical duties are pathetic. But then again movie reviewers have no moral compass or ethics. cornerstone2001 says January 30 2016 at 359 pm Hillary Lied and people died Reply jsm1963 says January 31 2016 at 1157 am Clever -\ Reply Mark says January 24 2016 at 406 pm ""Hack"" First thought after reading and seeing all the obvious verbiage implanted so ""liberally"". Im glad those portrayed in the movie actually exist I wish what YOU portray...didnt Reply Dave says January 23 2016 at 911 am Justin as a survivor of Benghazi let me tell you a little about yourself. Your agenda is your God you will not falter from your agenda no matter the facts that stare you in the face. People of your like are scary do to the mere fact you are able to vote despite your lack of ability to accept the obvious facts staring you in the face. These brave men are the only reason I breath air today and you sir no nothing of what happened yet claim to be an expert. To put it lightly you and your agenda driven information lacking bunch of liberal know it alls should drop your false agenda and stick to the facts Justin your a hack a biased fact ignoring hack I will leave you with this saying ""There are none so blind than those who refuse to see"" Reply jsm1963 says January 23 2016 at 1028 am In his opening paragraph he said ""its a tribute to the brave U.S. fighters who kept a horrific situation from turning much worse..."". What issue to you have with that agenda? Reply Diane says January 23 2016 at 250 am Youre an idiot. Do you have any respect for anyone who is not a liberal? You had to give this movie a back handed liberal compliment? People will go see and respect this movie and you will be largely ignored. Reply Ambrose Zera Cook-Saloway says February 5 2016 at 816 pm Im constantly accused of being liberal on the internet and Im disquieted with this critique. Reply Amy-Lou Giannelli says January 20 2016 at 1140 pm Wow shocker This no account ""writer"" ""critic"" slams this movie. You write for Variety color me surprised It was her State Department and yes your girl screwed up. Own it. As she should. Do not denigrate what those men did because you would never have the balls to buck supervisors and face hell to save Americans. If Im wrong then explain and Ill apologize. Reply jsm1963 says January 21 2016 at 1041 am How did he denigrate what these men did? Reply Seven Pinker says January 20 2016 at 1125 am ""Wisely this is about as far as 13 Hours goes in pointing the finger of blame."" How is that wise (or unwise for that matter)? If it were Bush and Cheney at risk of being blamed instead of Hillary and Obama would this writer have similarly characterized the movies efforts to avoid placing blame? Reply Terry Dindoffer says January 19 2016 at 324 pm Excellent movie Everyone should watch this and see what these men had to deal with Especially Hillary Thank you guys and girls for all you do Reply Roger C says January 19 2016 at 301 pm The movies described in your review (American Sniper and Lone Survivor) along with 13 Hours attempt to depict the real life struggles of American Military and Military Contractors. Unfortunately our military is an underclass that is seen by the left as playing a disposable role in our society. Our treatment of returning veterans since Vietnam is less respectful of their contribution then even illegals who get better medical care. I believe these movies depict a commitment to values such as honor and integrity that embarase the left and interrupt the echo chamber reality of their world. The fact that so many reviewers on rotten tomatoes pan 13 hours without seeing it demonstrates their reluctance to have their narrative contradicted. Veterans like myself get excited when they see the lone movie that tries to tell our story only to have a left leaning press tear it down. So much of Hollywoods productions are comic book like for those of us who have lived it Brad Pitt plays characters not unlike Marvel Comic book imaginary characters. Reply Doc says January 19 2016 at 624 am Just saw the movie last night with friends-the theater was packed. Michael Bay never disappoints the music by Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe was incredible as were the performances by John Krasinski James Badge Dale and others. Those of us who had family on the ground that night of Sept. 11th 2012 appreciate the acknowledgement of the courage and sacrifice made by so many during the attack on the embassy/diplomatic outpost and intelligence compound. Not that anyone ever bought the ""video"" story but the applause by the audience at the end spoke volumes. Reply Justin says January 18 2016 at 933 pm Hyperkinetic Abstract Art justincchang and Half-Successful Bid for Seriousness justincchang. Dude you should actually hear what the men that were on the ground have to say about what happened as well as what they have to say about the movie. Just watched an interview with three of the men that responded to the call when they were told to stand down. This movie is legit and its unfortunate that you have such a clouded opinion that you arent even willing to hear the truth. Reply jsm1963 says January 19 2016 at 1005 am You should understand that these men are most likely on the Paramount payroll to promote this film. Youre not likely to hear a negative word about this film from them for the time being. Reply Thomas Kopper says January 17 2016 at 754 pm Why were the embassy workers there were told to keep their mouths shut about the whole affair. The Trey Gowdy investigation could not interview any of these people and most are afraid to come forward. The lie about the video for the blame of the attack was pathetic.My conclusion is that we were there selling arms to people we shouldnt have which would be quite damning for Obama and Clinton. Reply Rommel Derivera says January 23 2016 at 1154 am Did you serve or you just dont have the balls to serve you dont know anything about the sacrifices we have undergone for the country Reply mike says January 17 2016 at 752 pm Lets be honest Liberal film critics will never give Bay any love It was a good movie and should be watched Reply decoratedvet says January 17 2016 at 645 am It is Hillarys incompetence before the attacks that led to 4 dead. No response to increased security in the most critical of spots in the world and no withdrawal from the embassy after all other embassies closed. As to the stand down order they are picking at words and no one has pressed it. Hold stand-down not authorized to go  who the hell cares what terminology that was used no one responded is the end result. Reply pageoturner says January 17 2016 at 604 am Theres no need for the movie to point any fingers. Its perfectly obvious that Obama Hillary the State Department and Department of Defense each decided to let those Americans they were responsible for in Benghazi die - not protect them not send help and not rescue them. Unlike the liberal media and stupid government were not stupid and dont need a narrative spoon fed. Reply Joe says January 16 2016 at 1101 pm Awesome movie. The truth can only be told from the people that were there. And the LIES come from the ones that were NOT there. Reply Marco says January 16 2016 at 720 pm The moron who wrote this article was obviously never in combat. Go fight in Nam and tell me about having empathy for the enemy or recognizing who is the enemy Battle is chaotic - cradle your friend in your arms when his body is blown in half and his life drains away The government didnt support us either. You really believe obama /hillary gave a crap about the men in Benghazi? Hell no it was all a cover-up - a video nobody saw amp; CYA for them. Where the hell were they when the call to arms was made? Nowhere to be found Bastards Reply John Aita says January 16 2016 at 550 pm awesome movie. I love how liberal reviewers always cry about bias in a prom military flick but lick matt damons taint when hes trashing america in whatever garbage hes currently peddling. its a great flick gorgeously shot like all Bays films..dripping with color and fast paced and frenetic. its not overtly political but still damning for clinton and obama who both were apparently asleep when the 3 am phone call came. by movies end youll be seething that no one came to help these guys with assets all over the place that could have made a huge difference. really well made film and the office guy pulled it off. Reply Barton Bowling says January 16 2016 at 530 pm Forget about all the political backbiting and left wing rhetoric. This film give a hardcore 13 hour timeline of the action. Realtime data was being sent to the White House Pentagon State Dept. and all of the agencies DIA/CIA/NSA ETC. There were numerous military assets within 30 minutes 1 hour 2 hours 3 hours and so forth. Nothing was sent. Doesnt matter whether or not the DIA COS gave a stand down order in the aftermath other than it was a very bad call. The major question is why were no military assets sent. I say again WHY-WERE-NO-MILITARY-ASSETTS-SENT? That is a failure way above the head of a CIA chief. Reply Olgilvie says January 31 2016 at 1015 am Military help was not sent because they did not want to acknowledge the presence of the CIA station or the extent of the operation.

My assessment; better than Lone Survivor and surprisingly close to Black Hawk Down. I suppose Bays style lends itself well to putting us right in the midst of frenetic chaos which serves the extendensive battle scenes superbly Reply woodrow says January 20 2016 at 355 am How can you declare that its easily Bays best film if you havent seen his other films? Reply Phyl says January 16 2016 at 142 pm Chang must have made up his mind prior to attending the movie. we do not need critics that have their review prior to seeing the movie. This movie is not political it only shows the events written by the men that were there Reply Tik ng says January 16 2016 at 622 am I believe that the 4 men were right and we must have had a way to get to them in 13 hours we are in th 21 century think about it Reply jsm1963 says January 16 2016 at 1208 pm Good point. You should bring this up to the Pentagon. Reply Joe A Gonzalez says January 15 2016 at 648 am I like that in your fifth paragraph you admit all the conspiracy theories are actually true Reply Bill B. says January 14 2016 at 716 am Michael Bay might have made a decent movie?

Reply jsm1963 says January 14 2016 at 851 am As soon as people hear about this Benghazi thing... Reply James Hartline says January 13 2016 at 1125 pm It must be an election year and you must be a registered Democrat as you use your column as a sidebar tool for assisting the floundering campaign of Hillary Clinton. Instead of reviewing the movie on its production and directorial merits alone you cannot help yourself as you take swipes as Michael Bay with the political talking points of Clinton and Obama. While you claim to be war weary in your review what does that have to do with the motion picture itself? During World War II the entire nation supported our military and Americas efforts to destroy the anti-Semitic butchers of Hitlers Nazi regime and the terrorists in control of ""Imperialist"" Japan who unprovoked bombed our nation and murdered over 3000 American citizens in the same manner as the anti-Semitic Islamic terrorists hijacked several American jetliners and flew them into New York skyscrapers and the Pentagon on 9/11. During World War II the American motion picture industry produced over a 100 major movies in support of our military and in support of Americas war effort. Many actors at the time surrendered their stardom fame and opulent lifestyles to serve in our Armed Forces. Everyone in America from the housewife to the movie starlet from the high school student to the professional athlete and from the corporate executive to the movie producer acted as one brace voice and one unified nation to save the United States and to save the world from the horrors of Hitlers Nazi Germany Mussolinis fascist Italy and the bloodthirsty emperor of Japan. No one in America during World War II was war weary as long as Americas enemies controlled the future of the world - not to mention the horrendous concentration camps Hitler operated throughout Europe where 12 million human beings including 6 million Jews were tortured starved raped burned alive in ovens and murdered in toxic gas-filled showers. While Hollywoods movie producers directors and actors desperately sacrificed all they could to race towards the frontlines of the war in Europe to liberate as many as possible before they were exterminated Hitlers Nazi regime was brutally force-sterilizing Jewish males across Europe and forcibly restraining Jewish women in dental chairs to extract any of their teeth with gold fillings. Some diabolical Nazi doctors experimented on Jewish prisoners being held in the concentration camps by skinning them alive without any sedation and then those same criminal doctors formed lamp shades out of the skins they had harvested from the defenseless Jewish prisoners. Fast forward to 2016 and to your review of Michael Bays courageous depiction of the Islamic terror onslaught against Americas Ambassador. The millions of Islamic terrorists who compose the global jihad against Israel Europe and America operate with the same vicious and heinous mentality that motivated Hitler and his Nazi regime. Hundreds of thousands of innocent people around the world and in America have been executed by the Islamic jihadists. In 2012 in Benghazi the American embassy was attacked and the United States ambassador and three courageous men who personify all that right about America were executed with the same horrific brutality that drove the Nazis to exterminate the Jews during World War II. In the midst of his reelection campaign Barak Obama refused to stand up to the Islamic jihadist war against America and he criminally covered up the true nature of the terrorist attack in Benghazi in the same depraved manner that Richard Nixon covered up the criminal Watergate break in to preserve his 1972 reelection. Hillary Clinton participated in Obamas cover up of the Benghazi terror attack. She replayed the mandated lies of the Obama administration - fraudulently blaming the Islamic terror attack on a videotape - and without a relentless pursuit of the truth in the same fashion as the Washington Posts Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein who exposed the Nixons administrations Watergate cover up the lies and Benghazi cover up of the Obama-Hillary Clinton administration would have never been exposed. For anyone in the Democratic Party-controlled entertainment industry to take on the Obama and Clinton as Michael Bays has done in his historically significant truthful and honorable war time depiction of the Islamic terror attack in Benghazi is to demonstrate great bravery and courageous service to the United States of America. Michael Bays and the actors in 13 hours have exemplified the very finest aspects of the entertainment industry. Rather than embracing the glorious service to our military that Michael Bays has given to America by his confrontation of the despicably corrupt lies of Obama and Clinton you have instead chosen to pollute the opportunity given to you to serve America during war time with your politically motivated swipe at the military and the brave Americans who died at the hands of Islamic terrorists and Hillary Clinton in Benghazi.

Ex-military operators protect the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi from terrorist attack. Director Michael Bay (217) Rated R for strong combat violence throughout bloody images and language. Area theaters How great is it when movies surprise you? With ""13 Hours"" director Michael Bay certainly does. Yep the guy who calls shots on popcorn flicks like ""Transformers"" delivers a gripping harrowing and heartfelt film about the 2012 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. While at it he transforms John Krasinski -- gentle Jim from ""The Office"" -- into a warrior with steel abs and matching nads. Sure Bay indulges some signature cinematic fetishes. But he shows restraint with the slowed-down sexed-up shots. War is gritty here not glamorous. Result characters stakes and emotions feel authentic -- all the more so thanks to terrific actors including James Badge Dale and Pablo Schreiber as actual ex-military men and family men who battled terrorists. John Krasinski (second from left with Pablo Schreiber David Denman and Dominic Fumusa) in the surprisingly excellent ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" Krasinski bearded and buff plays Jack Silva (a fake name of a real man). Hes one of six ex-military operators assigned to protect the CIA annex in post-Gadhafi Libya. Bay begins his film in space near a satellite then zooms down to as the text on screen notes the most dangerous place on the planet. He and screenwriter Chuck Hogan waste no time laying on the tension and the white-knuckle atmosphere seldom subsides. The script is strictly one-sided without concern for terrorist motivations. Its a chilling portrait of anti-American hatred by ""bad guys"" -- a repeated phrase in a script occasionally too blunt for its own good. Gentle John is that you? Fresh from ""The Office"" John Krasinski plays Jack Silva in ""13 Hours The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi."" (Photo Credit Christian Black/Photo by Christian Black) During the initial strike on the compound occupied by Ambassador Chris Stevens Silva and company are nearby but are ordered to do nothing even though residents are sitting ducks. But they do an end-run setting the stage for streaming gunfights high-speed car chases and explosions each crackly choreographed for maximum impact. Not everyone makes it out alive as reported at the time. And while theres no overt agenda or politicizing one cant watch ""13 Hours"" and wonder where was the U.S. forethought -- and backup. But thats missing the point -- and takeaway. Subtitled ""The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi"" and based on a book by members of the security team the band of brothers-style badassery looms large.

Nikki Haley Deftly Dismisses Trump in Powerful State of the Union Response Dont Forget Who Killed Bin Laden 5 Takeaways From Obamas Last State of the Union Michael Bays Benghazi Movie 13 Hours Gets Super-Sized Premiere at Dallas Cowboys ATamp;T Stadium (Photos) El Chapo Homeland Story Teased by Showtime Boss Great action sequences cant make up for a willfully stupid look at war and terror The six super troopers at the center of ""13 Hours"" a retelling of the 2012 terror attack on two American bases in Benghazi Libya are better than everyone else around them -- and they dont let you forget it. Cocky derision -- in both senses of that first word -- courses through the bulging veins of these identical towers of bearded brawn. Most are outfitted with a monosyllabic grunt of a name like Jack (John Krasinski) or Rone (James Badge Dale) or Boon (David Denman) as well as biceps thicker than their heads -- though their arms are never too heavy for them to thumb their nose at authority every chance they get. They seem like clones stamped all from the same super-soldier factory -- or from a run-of-the-mill Michael Bay movie. Bay means to honor (in his typically over-the-top butch way) the men who defended their fellow U.S. citizens from a two-pronged assault on an American consulate and a secret CIA outpost by violent militias. (These other men in this sextet are played by Pablo Schreiber Dominic Fumusa and Max Martini.) But Bay only does so by flattening all six of his heroes into a single type of smug jerk while dismissing everyone else as four-eyed dorks soft-handed weenies unworthy adversaries or an uppity ice princess (Alexia Barlier) in need of a lesson about what a real man is capable of. See Video Donald Trump Ad Features Hillary Clinton Laughing Over Benghazi Wreckage In terms of anything that has to do with characterization Chuck Hogans script is punishingly rote. But as bombastic shoot-em-up spectacle ""13 Hours"" is a visceral well-paced and often beautiful action-thriller. Handheld camerawork provides the guts and helicopter swoops the glory while the ""Transformers""-esque cacophony of metal straining against metal and Lorne Balfes timpani-heavy score make the sextets bloody defenses of their strongholds feel urgent and acute. With Malta doubling as Benghazi Libya looks tumbledown in some parts and Bond-level chic in others azure swimming pools and winding seaside roads patiently await whatever mayhem may arrive next. Contrasting against those calm waters is the tenseness that engulfs the six operatives at the burning consulate when dozens of armed fighters appear at the premises and the Americans have no idea which individuals want to help and which want them dead. After trading bullets (and the occasional launched grenade) with their enemies the six abandon the consulate and wrest from their nebbish boss (David Costabile) the right to defend the CIA compound. Also Read How Michael Bays Benghazi Movie Could Threaten Hillary Clintons Campaign Bay includes only a couple of cartoon flourishes as when a militia fighter is split into two by a grenade or a doors explosion into a handful of splinters is captured in slo-mo. But whats it all for? The director has insisted that his film has no political agenda which isnt strictly true because no work of art can ever be free of one. There are a few meatless bones thrown to liberals who might suspect a rah-rah movie about Benghazi of supporting the right especially in an election year Several Libyan characters for example are shown to be working with Americans (i.e. the mostly-good guys). See Video Fox News Bored With Benghazi? New Report Disputing Networks Conspiracy Theories Barely Covered But the soldiers (and hence the films) constant scoffing -- at agency hierarchy at government bureaucracy and particularly at anyone who wants to engage in any kind of foreign policy or intelligence effort that isnt shooting first and asking questions later -- is what ultimately makes ""13 Hours"" itself worthy of scorn. That myopic stance is arguably more insulting to the memory of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens who died during the 2012 attack than the endless Republican exertions to politicize his death or than any other part of this movies attempt to turn the circumstances of his demise into entertainment. Its not that Bays heroes dont deserve praise. But his film also didnt have to go out of its way to slur everyone else or their work. Rated R and taking on current events ""13 Hours"" is the rare Michael Bay movie that wasnt made with teenage boys in mind. But that doesnt make his latest any less callously juvenile.
