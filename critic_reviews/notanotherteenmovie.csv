Feature has five days or so to clean up with its target demo. Once similarly lowbrow ""How High"" opens let alone ""The Lord of the Rings"" not another peep will be heard from this stab at ""Airplane""-style yoks until its video debut. A nail in the coffin if not the heart of teen comedies ""Not Another Teen Comedy"" lobs some pretty feeble comic ammo at its easy genre target. Feature has five days or so to clean up with its target demo. Once similarly lowbrow ""How High"" opens let alone ""The Lord of the Rings"" two days later not another peep will be heard from this runway-stalled stab at ""Airplane""-style yoks until its video debut. Actually the more precise model here is ""Scary Movie"" as signalled by opening seg in which heroine Janey (Chyler Leigh) is caught masturbating with a giant dildo in bed to a video of the 99 Freddie Prinze Jr. ""classic"" ""Shes All That."" This inauspicious start establishes pics overall tendency to mistake mere bad taste for outrageousness and plain referentiality for satire. As requisite ""Pretty Ugly Girl"" protag glasses-wearing unpopular Janey becomes the subject of a bet between rival WASP team quarterbacks Jake (Chris Evans) and Austin (Eric Christian Olsen) as to whether Jake can make-over her into this years Prom Queen. Dreamboat Jake has recently been dumped by uber-blonde cheerleader g.f. Priscilla (Jaime Pressly) for a ""beautiful weirdo"" (Riley Smith) styled on Wes Bentley in ""American Beauty""-forever trailed by his floating plastic bag in one of the better sightgags here-so romantic conflict isnt an issue. Other archetypes attending the unimaginatively named John Hughes High School include Janeys Anthony Michael Hall-esque dweeb brother (Cody McMain) and his equally horny-desperate freshman sidekicks (Samm Levine Sam Huntington); her just-like-Jon-Cryer-in-""Pretty in Pink"" lovesick New Waver best friend (Eric Jungmann); Jakes carnally predatory sister (Mia Kirschner); an ""American Pie""-style foreign exchange bombshell (Cerina Vincent) etc. Cluttered yet generally flat progress opts for potty-mouthing and grossout material (latter ""peaking"" when a hot babe swaps extensive tongue with an old lady...ewwww) more often than absurdist verve. Even the de rigeur Big Football Game and Prom Dance setpieces fail to build much steam. Pic briefly ascends to a level of decent silliness when all principals perform a prom-anticipatory song number. Surprise guest appearance by Mr. T isnt a bad idea but Molly Ringwalds cameo at an airport-set finale unwisely makes her fire cheap shots at the only films shes remembered for. Elsewhere scattershot script by five credited writers is not well served by former MTV Production VP Joel Gallen making his feature helming debut. Staging is routine comic timing often weak less-than-stellar cast clearly left to its own devices. Those occasionally rising above with little help from the material are Pressly Olsen and in particular a vaingloriously Cruise-ifying Evans. Colorless Leigh makes one yearn for the comic finesse of ""Scarys"" lead chicklet Anna Faris though while most support players strain in vain. Soundtrack duly reprises many of the same 80s New Wave hits featured in original John Hughes teenpics. Yet for no evident reason beyond spurring CD sales (well what more reason do you need?) most have been rotely re-recorded by new throwaway pop bands. Tech and design aspects are just adequate.

His problem is so severe that he has to practice ordering pizza as he stands in line at his high-school cafeteria--and has to settle for sloppy Joes because he cant get the words out fast enough. Hal would seem to be the least likely candidate in the world to join the schools debate team yet hes recruited by its alluring motormouthed star Ginny Ryerson (Anna Kendrick) to replace her former partner the legendary Ben Wekselbaum (Nicholas DAgosto) after he suffers an onstage meltdown at the New Jersey State Finals and drops out of school.""Rocket Science"" joins a long line of movies about teenage outcasts struggling to find their place in the world; two years ago the prize entry was ""Thumbsucker."" But this sharp and painfully funny coming-of-age story--a hyperarticulate comedy about an inarticulate boy--manages to avoid just about every cliche of the genre. Each time you fear its going to go for the obvious it upends your expectations. Writer-director Jeffrey Blitz previously made the irresistible 2002 documentary ""Spellbound"" about kids in spelling bees. ""Rocket Science"" is his first dramatic feature and it has a quirky literary voice all its own--self-conscious but so sure-footed it earns its right to preen now and then.When Hal becomes the focus of Ginnys fierce attention hes not just surprised hes smitten. Love and sex are constantly on his mind and everywhere he turns he sees people smooching a reminder of his inexperience. After his dad (Denis OHare) packs his bags and leaves Hal has to watch his mom (Lisbeth Bartlett) start up a new affair with the Korean-American neighbor Judge Pete (Stephen Park)--they cant keep their hands off each other. The judges nerdy son Heston (Aaron Yoo) joins Hals small circle of goober pals which includes the budding voyeur Lewis (Josh Kay) who spies on Ginny from his bedroom window. Adding to Hals miseries is his angry compulsive older brother Earl (Vincent Piazza) who rarely misses a chance to terrorize his stuttering sibling. These are all wonderfully bizarre and very real characters vividly brought to life by a cast of refreshingly unfamiliar faces. Best of all is Thompson who lets us see the sly intelligence and quick wit lurking behind Hals frustrated tongue-tied appearance. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week The debate topic he and Ginny must prepare for is wouldnt you know abstinence. One of the pleasures of Blitzs film is that it immerses us in the fraught competitive pressures of the high-school debate world--like ""Spellbound"" it gets the details right. Blitzs brainy kids who run the gamut from the pathetically awkward to the brazenly self-assured from the nastily scheming to the hopelessly geeky are a far cry from the usual horny adolescents Hollywood comedies serve up to flatter their target audience. Theyre no less hormonal but a lot more human.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The rebels got a problem though She wears glasses and a ponytail. Who would date a loser like that? Finally she gets a makeover and enjoys her first official ""slow-motion entrance"" to the tune of Sixpence None the Richers ""Kiss Me."" ""Not Another Teen Movie"" is a big fat juicy spitball lobbed with mostly dead-on aim at the teen-smarm cliches that have accumulated like so much earwax over the last three years. The films targets are obvious enough but theres a shimmer of wit to the way it satirizes movies as disparate as ""Shes All That"" ""Varsity Blues"" ""Bring It On"" even the Wes Bentley art-freak section of ""American Beauty"" as in essence John Hughes redos. In post-Hughes Hollywood the bad joke is that a ""romance"" consists of nothing more than one entirely prescribed fashion-catalog role - jock princess rebel - falling for another.

Starring Chyler Leigh and Chris Evans. Directed by Joel Gallen. (R. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Not Another Teen Movie"" proves that its possible to make a movie so tasteless and so crude that audiences dont laugh. This is worthwhile information. It means theres a limit. The movie is like a probe sent into what was assumed to be infinite space -- only to hit a black wall in the galaxy just beyond ""American Pie."" Example A son confides to his father that he has romantic troubles. The father tells him not to worry; he has just the girl to end his sexual longing. Whereupon he sends in the boys mother. Are we laughing yet? No were still waiting for the punch line. But that is the punch line. ""Not Another Teen Movie"" is rated R and it should be for its raunchy references to oral sex coprophilia and incest not to mention all the nudity and the atmosphere of all-around prurience. Yet ironically its designed to be appreciated most by people who are too young to buy themselves a ticket. The picture is a satire of the teen movie genre. For an adult seeing a parody of ""Shes All That"" the 1999 Rachael Leigh Cook/Freddie Prinze romance is not only pointless. It feels instantaneous. Didnt we just see that thing? But to a 16-year-old for whom time passes much more slowly ""Shes All That"" is part of the cultural landscape something from the ancient days of junior high school. About the oldest movie parodied here is ""Cant Hardly Wait"" a Jennifer Love Hewitt movie from 1998. Theres a running gag involving a Hewitt look- alike who makes people stop in their tracks each time she enters the room. Not much of a running gag. The most recent film parodied is ""Summer Catch"" from way back in 2001 August to be exact. ""Not Another Teen Movie"" actually satirizes a movie from four months ago. Satires earn their laughs by puncturing pretense by finding the core of ridiculousness underneath the pompous surface. So how does one go about satirizing ""American Pie""? For that matter how would one satirize the Marx Brothers? Something thats already absurd already intentionally ridiculous cant truly be parodied. It can only be referenced -- and then in a desperate attempt at humor vulgarized. In the case of ""American Pie"" a filmmaker has to get up early in the morning to come up with something yet more vulgar than the original. Director Joel Gallen and a team of five writers manage it with bland results. The opening bit shows the heroine brainy Janey Briggs (Chyler Leigh) lying in bed one morning watching a romantic movie. Feeling inspired she takes out an industrial-size vibrator and -- but no. Forget it. Being a film critic isnt the most dignified of callings but everybody has his limit. Suffice it to say the girls father walks in then the family priest then some neighborhood children. The movie follows the plotline of every other teen movie made in the past few years. A plain Jane whos actually beautiful falls in love with a jock (Chris Evans) who is in fact dating her just to win a bet. But then he falls in love too. The films one claim to wit is that it mocks the ludicrousness of a formula that in order to work depends on no one in the movie being able to tell that girls such as Rachael Leigh Cook and Julia Stiles (""10 Things I Hate About You"") are among the prettiest in the school. So what? Everybody knows those movies are silly. The makers of ""Not Another Teen Movie"" should be embarrassed that in parodying ""Shes All That"" they copied most of the plot and then made a movie that bogs down in the same places as the original. Its not just ironic. Its pathetic to make something called ""Not Another Teen Movie"" thats just another teen movie. This film contains raunchy humor nudity and sexual situations.
