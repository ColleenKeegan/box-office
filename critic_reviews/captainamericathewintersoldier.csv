Like many filmgoers (most?) Ive spent the last decade waiting for the superhero-movie bubble to pop. Sure a few gifted auteur/enthusiasts--Bryan Singer Sam Raimi Christopher Nolan--had proven they could be successful within the narrow constraints of the genre. But talented directors move on to new projects and ultimately I assumed the superhero genre would collapse under the weight of its own ridiculousness. It had happened before after all.Related Story Why The Avengers Worked So Well Then along came Marvel Studios and--more particularly--Feige. Named president of the studio in 2007 at the age of 33 hes since had a run of almost Pixarian success. In six years hes produced nine Marvel movies by eight different directors all of them interconnected even as they vary radically in tone and locale from the interstellar fantasy cityscapes of Asgard to the bitter alpine forests of WWII Germany. His misfires (The Incredible Hulk Iron Man 2) have been mild ones and his hits (almost everything else) have been remarkable. According to Bloomberg a flow chart on Feiges office wall has Marvel releases mapped out all the way to 2028. If he maintains anywhere near his current standard we may have to hold our obituaries for the superhero genre for a good long while.Captain America The Winter Soldier continues--indeed elevates--Marvels strong run. It is easily the studios most ambitious undertaking short of The Avengers artfully knitting together Caps WWII history and the present-day Marvel-verse while also serving as robust connective tissue to next years Avengers sequel. The performances are good the script (by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) is sharp and the action sequences are nothing short of superb. Those who dont care for superhero flicks may not be won over. But those with any affinity for the genre are likely to emerge profoundly satisfied.Where the first Captain America movie was engineered as a throwback 1940s war film the new one is instead an espionage flick that self-consciously harkens to the political thrillers of the 1970s. Having been thawed out of his post-war freeze and then commissioned as an Avenger Captain America--a.k.a. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans)--is now working as a moderately reluctant contractor for SHIELD the global spy service run by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). When pirates highjack a SHIELD vessel in the Indian Ocean Rogers and the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) are sent on what appears to be a routine hostage-rescue mission. It is not of course routine at all as Fury has another secret agenda for the operation SHIELD has been compromised at a high level and hes trying to find out how and by whom.Im going to leave it there as far as the plot goes. Many of the narrative surprises and Big Reveals have already been widely circulated and theyre a pleasure even if you see them coming. But the less you know going in the more pleasurable I suspect theyll be. (Read--or better yet dont--accordingly.) Suffice it to say that in addition to the familiar characters already mentioned--and SHIELD agent Maria Hill played by Cobie Smulders who has a small but important role--were also introduced to former paratrooper Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and to Nick Furys boss Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). An important new friendship for Rogers is inaugurated and another from his past plays a crucial role in what unfolds.The movies message is calibrated to the political moment and speaks to fears shared on both left and right.The Steve Rogers of this film is no longer the plucky underdog raring to fight ""bullies"" like the Nazis. He is as one adversary notes ""out of time"" a man with a black-and-white disposition in a world of grays encumbered by nostalgia and plagued with regret. Though he allows that the contemporary world has its advantages--""Foods a lot better. We used to boil everything""--he is struggling to find his place in it. When someone asks him what makes him happy his response is ""I dont know.""The political themes of the film--involving the surveillance state and governmental misuse of personal data--are likewise grimmer and more sophisticated (relatively speaking) than the usual Marvel fare featuring notable echoes of the Bourne saga. The movies message is exquisitely calibrated to the political moment and is one that speaks to apprehensions shared on both left and right In a world as chaotic as this the temptation to trade freedom for security is ever-present.Though largely shot in Cleveland and Los Angeles the film is set predominantly in and around Washington D.C. with the 60-story SHIELD headquarters (the ""Triskelion"") looming amusingly if preposterously across the Potomac from the Kennedy Center (and as it happens the offices of The Atlantic). Its fun too to imagine Steve Rogers living in an apartment just above Dupont Circle. And wait until you see where SHIELDs secret helicarrier hangar is hidden...Its unclear how much Avengers director Joss Whedon might have contributed to the script. (He did direct one of the post-credit sequences--yes there are two bring extra popcorn.) But the movie has a decidedly Whedonesque flavor the snatches of recurring dialogue the sudden narrative reversals the strong female characters (there are at least four instances when a last-second rescue is engineered by a woman) and yes one shocking death.Evans offers another solid outing as the All-American hero even if he lacks the gravitational charisma of Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark. Johansson and Jackson fulfill their customary roles with aplomb and Redford lends his 70s-conspiracy-flick cred to the proceedings. But its Mackie as Caps new friend Sam Wilson (you may know him by another name) who steals pretty much every scene hes in.The action in Winter Soldier sets a high-water mark for Marvel with sequences that are fluid dynamic and exceptionally well choreographed.Perhaps the biggest surprise however is directors Joe and Anthony Russo. Their experience lies primarily in television comedy (Arrested Development Community) so the crisp dialogue makes perfect sense. But who could have guessed theyd have such a knack for directing action scenes? Foregoing CGI for live stunts more than previous Marvel films Winter Soldier sets a high-water mark for the studio with sequences that are fluid dynamic and exceptionally well choreographed.The movie has its moments of levity. There are gags about War Games and Pulp Fiction and just how long its been since Captain Americas last kiss. (70 years?) Stephen Strange gets a quick name check Garry Shandling reprises his Iron Man 2 role as a potato-headed U.S. Senator and Stan Lee has what may be his best cameo to date.But for the most part Captain America The Winter Soldier is an unexpectedly grown-up thriller taut suspenseful moody and on occasion even sad. The result is a film that is--in the best Kevin-Feige-ian sense of the word--a Marvel.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

Imagine looking back on this decade the dawn of the age of weaponized surveillance drones and finding that the only harbingers of what was to come were the (middling) remake of RoboCop and Captain America The Winter Soldier. Beneath the expensive computer-generated busyness of this second Captain America installment is a bracing old-style conspiracy thriller made extra-scary by new technology and the increasingly ugly trade-offs of a post-9/11 world. The witness to this social upheaval is the biologically enhanced Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America (Chris Evans) a holdover from the Greatest Generation when the USA fought Fascism while remaining true to its democratic values. Whether you buy that rosy view is beside the point--Captain America buys it big-time. Wandering incognito through a museum exhibit dedicated to his heroics he muses that he hasnt just lost the buddies who fought beside him in World War II he has lost the clarity the hope. ""You saved the world"" someone reminds him. ""The world has changed"" he says sadly. And he aint seen nothin yet. Rogers has doubts about his super-duper handlers at S.H.I.E.L.D. chiefly the ever-pissed-off Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). But hes blindsided by whats coming a new entity that has sprung up from inside the organization led by new-style patriots who rationalize the killing of millions to save (they maintain) billions. You could argue that the true horror of the movies real-life counterparts is that theyre not rogue nuts -- that they take their cues from the tippy-top of the government pyramid. But their actions have a Dick Cheney-esque resonance. The super-drones when they appear are the perfect realization of ""the dark side."" Theyre the stuff of nightmares -- and theyre almost here. Patches of Captain America The Winter Soldier are amazingly deft especially when you realize that the directors Anthony and Joe Russo come from TV -- and comedy not drama. Theyve obviously storyboarded the hell out of the movie with help from the right people. An assassination attempt on Fury and a subsequent car chase are shot and edited like nothing in this series; for a moment the Russos seem to think theyre making an actual thriller instead of a CG extravaganza in which the way out of every logistical problem is to throw money at it. In the martial-arts-heavy fight scenes the frames are too tight for my taste -- theyre rock-em-sock-em blurs. But the cutting (by Jeffrey Ford) has rhythm and momentum. And you see enough of Scarlett Johanssons action doubles to know that theyre superb acrobats as witty in motion as the extra-dry Johansson in repose. The problem is still one of scale. When the Captain and Johanssons Natasha fly off to rescue hostages at sea the plane looks suspiciously computer-generated. Its a souped-up plane but still just a plane Does everything need to be constructed out of 1s and 0s? The FX-swollen climax is too long and repetitious -- it lacks elegance. How many times can the Captain throw his mighty shield before you think Ho hum? The filmmakers introduce yet another action hero -- Falcon (Anthony Mackie) -- who adds nothing but fake-looking swoops and more clutter and the fight between the Captain and the mysterious deadly assassin the Winter Soldier goes on and on with diminishing returns. The thinking is ""Why build to a single climax when theres money for five of them -- plus multiple endings?"" At these prices (hundreds of millions with whole futures riding on the ""franchise"") the studios must think they cant afford to trust their audience. They forget that thrillers are more satisfying when theyre lean and mean -- that even in spectacles less can be more. But Captain America The Winter Soldier is still much better than it needs to be. I even found myself more tolerant of Chris Evans and his ridiculous pecs after I read that he was as frustrated by his blandness onscreen as I am. (Somewhat petulantly he has vowed -- and then un-vowed--to give up acting on the grounds that his best performances are largely unseen. Keep at it Chris) The movies most novel element is the presence of Sundance Institute godfather Robert Redford as an enigmatic politician. Im sure there will be purists who think Redford has sold out not to mention tarnished by association the 70s most chilling paranoid conspiracy thriller Three Days of the Condor. But why shouldnt Redford get a piece of all that franchise money? Maybe hell even channel it into a worthy cause -- like exposing the kind of man he plays in this movie. Thats my cockeyed countercultural optimist talking. The reality is that the Redford character that turns over documents to the New York Times at the end of Condor and thinks it will make a difference belongs to a different era. And Fox News would call this Captain America a terrorist-loving Communist tool.

Jackson Rated PG-13 (intense sequences of violence gunplay and action throughout) Running time 136 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1250am on Friday Apr. 04 2014 Friday Apr. 04 2014 Wednesday Apr. 02 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Captain America The Winter Soldier the latest Marvel movie/merchandising monolith has all the makings of another generic comic-book blockbuster. Its a too-long sequel with a few snappy one-liners a third act that concludes with a predictable cacophony of explosions and the usual end-credit previews for the next installment. Nothing new to see here.Except for the most part it works.Maybe its the charm and chemistry between Chris Evans as our squared-jawed hero Steve Rogers and Scarlett Johansson as his partner in global crime-fighting Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow. Maybe its the rock-em-sock-em mano a mano action scenes that directors/brothers Anthony and Joe Russo stage. Maybe its the topical relevancy as the government Captain America defends seems to be turning on its own people launching a worldwide satellite spying program that theoretically will have the ability to kill those presumed dangerous to the state. Whatever the case Captain America The Winter Soldier is one of the better entries in the franchise.At the start of the movie Rogers is undergoing some emotional turmoil. A chance meeting with veteran Sam Wilson (an engaging Anthony Mackie) who works with soldiers struggling with PTSD brings to the surface mixed feelings Rogers has about his role as Captain America the genetically engineered defender of all things red white and blue. Remember hes originally a man from the 40s and hes not sure his old-fashioned sense of whats fair has a place in this modern world.His faith in the institutions around him is further shaken by the latest threat The agency he works for S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division) has evildoers within its ranks. They are pushing for the new surveillance program under the guise of protecting our freedoms.Its up to Captain America to wage a one-man war against the people he used to trust. And who can he trust? Natasha? His no-nonsense boss Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson)? Government bureaucrat Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford)? His flirty next-door neighbor Kate (Emily VanCamp from TVs Revenge)?And there is the Winter Soldier of the title another soldier (Sebastian Stan) like Rogers modified to be indestructible but one who takes orders from the bad guys. With all the world against him how can Captain America hope to survive?At 136 minutes it takes the Russos working from a script by Christopher Markus Stephen McFeely and Ed Brubaker a while to get to that answer. And you dont have to see one minute of the film to know what the answer is.But theres enough fun and actual suspense along the way to make the whole affair entertaining. While the Russos made their mark in television -- working on sitcoms like Community and Happy Endings -- theyve made the transition to big-budget action seamlessly. In fact theres a car chase between Fury and the baddies thats especially convincing.Be sure to stay through the credits as there are two previews promoting the whole Marvel enterprise which is the point after all.Yet if Captain America The Winter Soldier is indeed an augur of things to come during this special-effects-laden summer maybe it wont be such a painful season after all.

Captain America American beauty Add to ... Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 04 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Apr. 03 2014 559PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely Starring Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson Classification PG Year 2014 Country USA Language English The casting of Robert Redford as a high-ranking low-scruples D.C. power player in Captain America The Winter Soldier plays on The Sundance Kids status as the ranking elder statesman of Hollywoods liberal eite. But it also serves another purpose. The presence of the star of 1970s chestnuts such as Three Days of the Condor and All the Presidents Men gives The Winter Soldier a fetchingly old-school texture and more heft than youd expect from the usual brand extension This is the first Marvel Studios movie since the original Iron Man that really stands on its own.Not only that but by bringing in Redford a titan of the so-called New Hollywood to shore up its ensemble cast the studio shows that it hasnt forgotten about the grown-ups in the audience. And by tweaking this sequel to play more like a cloak-and-dagger thriller than a special-effects blowout (though of course theres plenty of that too) directors Anthony and Joe Russo have delivered an unusually satisfying and substantive superhero movie. Redfords impeccably dressed Alexander Pierce is a senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official with close ties to cycloptic head honcho Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who remains the terse centre around which the whole Marvel Universe revolves. The Winter Soldier smartly throws things off-kilter when Fury is brutally assaulted in broad daylight by a masked cybernetically enhanced assassin - the Winter Soldier of the title - who has an inside line on S.H.I.E.L.D.s operational protocol. And when Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) tries to figure out who ordered the hit he finds himself on the outs with the suddenly unstable spy agency whose agents are angling to take him down.The idea of the red-white-and-blue-clad Captain America involuntarily matched up against the military-industrial complex that created him is compelling and Evans imparts a sense of disillusioned weariness to his performance that clashes with his characters rah-rah norm. A scene in which Rogers clandestinely visits the Smithsonian to see an exhibit about his Second World War exploits is clever and melancholy in a way that transcends the jokey glibness of the Iron Man franchise. It also counters Captain Americas image as a 40s-era relic (he was the straight man in The Avengers) while evincing a fond possibly foolish nostalgia for the unambiguous heroism of the Greatest Generation.There are some surprisingly sombre notes in the script such as a bittersweet encounter between Rogers and his former lover Peggy Carter (a heavily but convincingly made-up Hayley Atwell) now in her 80s and confined to a retirement home and the scene where Afghanistan war vet Sam Wilson (the superb Anthony Mackie) exhorts a post-traumatic stress disorder support group to work through the impacts of their battlefield experiences.While it never quite crosses over into the fashionable ""darkness"" of Christopher Nolans determinedly grim (and ideologically incoherent) Batman movies The Winter Soldier still makes an effort to bounce its plotting off real-world issues. For all his formidable fighting skills the titular villain is ultimately just a cog in a larger war machine that would use orbiting satellite technology to pre-emptively vaporize foreign threats.Not that the film is too heavy In one refreshingly campy flourish Toby Jones reprises his role from the first Captain America as an evil Nazi scientist whos since transferred his consciousness to a computer - hes like Dr. Strangelove by way of Hal 9000. There are also some funny one-liners for Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow who keeps threatening to become a romantic foil for the Captain only to pull back (Johanssons teasing performance here is like a warm-up for her man-eating turn in the impending Under the Skin).If theres something formulaic about the way the films ragtag heroes - including Sam whose skill as a pilot comes in handy - come together for the inevitable final action blow-out the crispness of the storytelling is still pleasing.What it comes down to is the difference between spectacle and craftsmanship. The Winter Soldier has plenty of the former - every dollar of its estimated 170-million (U.S.) budget is onscreen - but its also got an intricate dramatic and thematic structure holding everything in place. For instance Steve and Sams bond over the fact that they both lost wingmen in wars six decades apart is never overstated in the dialogue. And in an adventure that finds S.H.I.E.L.D. cracking from the inside-out the Captains two most spectacular hand-to-hand battles see him discarding his trademark shield and absorbing body blows along the way. Theres comic-book poetry in that juxtaposition and The Winter Soldier is just grave and graceful enough to make it work.

I just loved the old fashioned feel to it. It really does feel like a nineteen seventies spy thriller. The story is the most complex of any past Marvel movie Chris Evans is at his best as Captain America this time around. And the fight scenes between Captain America and The Winter Soldier are just jaw-dropping Just when I thought Marvel would never top The Avengers we are given a movie that not only redefines the comic book genre but ten years from now it will be regarded as one of the classic movies of the 2000 teens. /5 See IT Two Thumbs UP Jack.said on Monday April 14 2014 105119 PMWhy do i get the feeling that Roaper underestimated Captain America. As a fan of comics. What always made Cap great was not his powers. But was because he stood up for principles. Even when those principles went against his own government. That is why i always loved the character. Sure hes a Goody Two Shoes. But hes a pretty bad ass Gooy Two Shoes. Chris Etratasaid on Sunday April 06 2014 105815 PMI thought this was the second best Marvel Cinematic Universe film behind only Avengers. Where would you put it compared to the other MCU films Mr Roeper? DCWhatthesaid on Saturday April 05 2014 44652 PMI didnt expect to enjoy Cap 2 this much. Great dialog about important issues especially relevant in this decade. Some of the coolest hand-to-hand fighting scenes ever. I hated Evans as the Torch. And thought of the first movie as mere supporting biographical material for the Avengers. But this one knocked it out of the ballpark. It was long yes but didnt bother my attention span in the least. The one thing I forgot to do was sit through the credits at the end. Will have to catch it a second time on DVD with pleasure.

L to R Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) Captain America (Chris Evans) amp; Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) Credit Zade Rosenthal/Marvel In theaters Friday April 4 2 stars (out of 4 stars) PHOTOS Stars as superheroes Heres a comic-book flick in which the audience has a superpower the ability to anticipate every beat on screen Its not that this Captain America sequel is a disaster of Green Lantern proportions. Think a chuckle here some slick fight choreography there. But fans of the franchise should expect more than a boilerplate action flick that brings absolutely nothing new to the genre. Still lets concede that Chris Evans -- he of the square jaw and inflatable biceps -- is perfectly cast as our wholesome hero (nee Steven Rogers). To recap he was genetically enhanced World War II super soldier -- then spent decades of his life frozen in a block of ice. Now that hes thawed out the Captain has a lot to catch up on. A fellow agent (Anthony Mackie) suggests he listen to a 1972-era Marvin Gaye album. The vet adds the recommendation to a handwritten list that also includes ""Nirvana"" and ""Star Wars/Trek."" Clever/clever. PHOTOS Shirtless hunks But theres no time to discover pop culture milestones when the S.H.I.E.L.D. agency has been compromised. (Warning mild spoiler ahead). Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has been shot but not before warning the Captain to ""trust no one."" Cut directly to Robert Redfords Alexander Pierce a domineering honcho at the agency. He wears a tailored suit and appears to lack a soul which means hes the villain. Not a deliciously sinister villain like Thors Loki or a rakish villain like Iron Man 3s Mandarin. Just another power-mongering corporate sleaze. Its baffling why an A-list actor like Redford would be given such B-grade material. (And for that matter why Garry Shandling agreed to ham it up as Pierces chief political ally. Hey now You can do better) Redford is also saddled with a laughably convoluted and nefarious plan Order a hit on the Captain and his frisky cohort Natasha/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) launch missiles to take out millions of would-be terrorists dominate the globe. This is just an unnecessarily complicated way of saying that the entire world order is at stake. The elusive assassin behind the madness is known around the ranks as the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). Hes your standard-issue psycho with a tragic backstory which doesnt get nearly the amount of explanation it warrants. PHOTOS Scarletts hottest moments Indeed a film that aspires to be a smart political conspiracy thriller just devolves into a Marvel checklist. Every gotcha twist leads to a bombastic explosion or extended combat scene. (No surprise that when the Captain is surrounded by henchmen in an elevator he finds a way to get out of it. Then again since these killers only seem to aim at his powerful shield they deserve their fate.) Every bit of CGI-created violence leads to a groaner of a quip (""I guess hes the bad guy""). For 136 minutes. Oh and dont forget the obligatory Stan Lee cameo and cryptic end-credits teaser. No point in shielding audiences from the simple truth Captain Americas latest adventure is pure filler until Avengers 2.

Marvel-Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Video Captain America The Winter Soldier (trailer) Monitor Movie Guide The arrival of ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" is the franchise film equivalent of throwing out the first pitch to open the baseball season. It could be worse. If we must endure yet another spring-summer cycle of comic book superheroes this movie at least delivers the wham-bang goods (recycled though they may be).Muscly Chris Evans is back as Captain America this time in modern-day Washington D.C. where it appears that nefarious traitors are undermining S.H.I.E.L.D. More topical than most films of this ilk - supersecret surveillance tactics are at the core of the shenanigans - this second installment in the ""Captain America"" series is a bit heavier on real-world blood and bullets than is customary (or necessary) for this kind of escapade.But codirectors (and brothers) Joe and Anthony Russo keep the action nimble and literally high-flying. Samuel L. Jackson is back as Nick Fury and no one wears an eyepatch better. Scarlett Johansson reprising her role as ex-Soviet operative Black Widow mostly slinks and slugs. Robert Redford plays against type as a paramilitary meanie. Add another sack of gold to Marvels coffers. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence gunplay and action throughout.)

"Patriot Act << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Billy Bobs Blues  Next The Death of the Booker Facebook Twitter Print Movies Patriot Act The lovable Chris Evans returns in Captain America The Winter Soldier. Plus his costar Scarlett Johansson gets freaky in Under the Skin. by Wesley Morris on April 3 2014 C  aptain America has the cleverest gimmick of any comic-book movie. Government science turned Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) from a patriotic runt too scrawny for WWII into a strapping supersoldier put on ice and many decades later thawed into a literal walking anachronism who works for the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. The long chaotic first installment of this franchise from 2011 (Captain America The First Avenger) wasted a lot of time setting this up. But both The Avengers and the smartly conceived frustratingly executed new Captain America film The Winter Soldier know where the jokes are and how to tell them. Mostly theyre at the expense of Steve whose cultural gaps everyone has a good time trying to fill. He keeps a notebook of movies he needs to watch and albums to hear. The war vet and PTSD expert he befriends Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) insists one of those records is Marvin Gayes Trouble Man soundtrack. At some point he and a fellow agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. Natasha ""Black Widow"" Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) stand over an ancient computer console and she explains the WarGames joke shes just made. I know I know he more or less says. This is a superficial but reasonably sophisticated and resonantly human superhero stress. Steve has the visage endurance and athleticism of a thirtysomething male (OK nobody has his athleticism) but socially hes treated like the old man at the start-up. That alienation is different from the foreignness of say Thor a Norseman who crashed to Earth in a funny costume and brought friends. Steve is an American foreigner in the United States. His sense of cool is now simultaneously antique and vintage. To see him in his white T-shirts leather bombers and jeans in 2014 is to understand how some of the Greatest Generation took a greaser detour. Marvel could devote an entire project to playing ""hey geezer"" with Captain America to reconciling matters of taste history and identity. But these movies are obligated to find a conflict that advances the Avengers narrative. The plot here involves a strategic plan to rid the planet of 20 million people for allegedly harmful activities that theyre predicted to eventually participate in. But the theme of that conflict is trust. Steve begins to question whether he can take his boss Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) at his word. Why would Fury send Captain America to rescue hostages from a battleship in the Indian Ocean without telling him that Black Widow is there on a separate mission? The characters distaste for secrecy is touching. Hell need a gallon of mouthwash for a movie in which almost everything Steve has learned is a lie including the nonsense that Trouble Man is the Marvin Gaye album to cure lifes ills. Everything is out of control. S.H.I.E.L.D. is severely compromised. Fury is viciously attacked. Robert Redford as a S.H.I.E.L.D. higher-up is talking to holograms. And a seemingly indestructible gentleman appears to have taken a break from the WWEs outlaw outfit to help destroy the planet one highway at a time. This would be the eponymous Winter Soldier. He kills skids and sprints in black. He flings his hair and wears a mask only so when it falls off Steve can be shocked and appalled by the face beneath it. You could see this coming. But its a satisfying wrinkle that gives Steve a good moment of consternation.  Evans is the only actor I can think of for this part. Hes on the rugged end of handsome. He could be used to market power tools and 150 cologne. He seems tall. For these movies hes puffed himself up to comical action-figure proportions. But hes playing the ""hero"" more than the ""super."" As Captain America hes required to simulate the impossible leaping up and off buildings catching his shield as it saws mightily toward his open hands (usually as hes running or jumping and looking in another direction at the time). Steves attractions are also presented as things of the past -- he still pines for a now-aged girl (Hayley Atwell) and a dead best friend (Sebastian Stan). In the last incarnation of the Fantastic Four Evans was the Human Torch and he turned the part into the sort of self-obsessed heartthrob who winds up as the sleazy boyfriend on a reality show. You saw him in those two movies easily among the least of the Marvel universe and thought This guy could be a star. With Evans you often think that. But Hollywood has almost nowhere for his blend of comic cockiness adorability and fitness. Leonardo DiCaprio Bradley Cooper Tom Cruise Channing Tatum Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Pine are all still working. Evans might have It. But hes never been It. I imagine hes fighting for the handful of good one-off parts and is either losing them to stiff competition or the scheduling demands of being Captain America. (This may have contributed to the brief moment the other week when folks thought he was going to quit acting to direct.) But being Captain America is working for him. A role that should be a prison has actually given Evanss charisma something to push back against. Steves antique status neutralizes the smirking jock he seems to be born to play. Squareness becomes him. The characters earnestness is a tonic to the smarmy backhanded heroism Robert Downey Jr. uses for the Iron Man movies. Downeys Tony Stark saves the world because it flatters his ego. Steve Rogers saves the world because its right. Stark works for himself. Captain America works for us.  The credited writers of The Winter Soldier Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely do their part. The movie thinks like a comic book. Theres wit and the occasional idea and the plot twists and harks back to previous adventures. That allows for the amusing virtual return of Toby Jones as the supervillainous Nazi biochemist Arnim Zola and for Mackie to say things like ""How do we know the good guys from the bad guys?"" But Sam and Steve bond more or less over both having lost wingmen in war -- and then Sam becomes the character Falcon (born in 1969 he was the first major black superhero in a comic book) thereby becoming Steves new wingman. The movie is actually more fun when its still and its characters are actually talking to each other. Lord knows the directors of The Winter Soldier Anthony and Joe Russo are better with gags and repartee than with how to visually navigate an action sequence. The Russos have made a couple of movies -- the so-so caper Welcome to Collinwood and You Me and Dupree a comedy so abominable that Owen Wilson Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon havent been the same since starring in it. The Russos recovered fine. They went to television and excelled putting in work on Happy Endings Arrested Development and Community. How one gets from cult-classic sitcommery to mass-cult blockbusting is a complicated process. Its possible both to like the comic-book movie theyve made and to be driven nuts by how terrible it looks. Its the sort of thing you notice only when people are fighting. That of course is a problem. People are often fighting and the fights have been shot in the chaotic manner of bad action movies. The camera jitters and jumps and cranes and whips. What it never seems to do is sit still. That hostage rescue on the ship occurs at night and in 3-D the drabness of the ship and exterior darkness turn that sequence into murk. The editing grinds up motion into meaningless bits. The shots dont match and the images come at us so hectically that the editing can barely keep up with itself. At some point were no longer watching an action movie. Were watching mirepoix. During that early hostage rescue theres a fight between Captain America and a parkouring French-speaking bad guy on an open deck. And the pacing slows down enough for us to appreciate what might pass for framing. Each man occupies one end of the screen. But even then its not enough to qualify as satisfying. I suppose the movie is going for intense immediacy. Its trying to goose your pulse. It winds up raising your blood pressure. So much money and time and planning has gone into creating effects and staging these sequences. During the climactic finale set amid skyscrapers and sky Mackie has to run across an entire floor as a ship crashes behind him and then leap out of a window. The stress of that moment was compounded by the number of cuts required to pull it off. Theres a very good fight on a Washington D.C. highway thats equally unattractive. Is all this formal chaos meant to disguise the use of stunt doubles or the directors lack of confidence? Writing about The Raid 2 which opened last week Grantlands Alex Pappademas ended his besotted review with a plea to appreciate the professional loving violence of the movie before the arrival of The Winter Soldier. His word for the action was ""artisanal."" And hes right in using it to distinguish between a grindhouse astonishment and what amounts to a commercial for a megamovie slated to open next summer between mayhem and mess. Most of the action sequences in action movies look the opposite of artisanal now and the cruddy-looking assemblage doesnt prevent them from being big hits. You have to go to the art house or to say FXs Justified and The Americans and Cinemaxs Banshee to find competently filmed stunt choreography. No audience will revolt because The Winter Soldier looks as if it were made in a food processor. I had fun. But I could have had more. Im not demanding filmmaking or visionary talent per se. Im demanding competence. Given the fealty these movies have shown toward comic books and their fans it shouldnt be too much to ask for the same respect to be shown toward movies. Steve Rogers would get it. Artisanal is just another way of saying ""This is how people used to do their jobs.""  Under the Skin might pass for artisanal science fiction. Its strange and arbitrary the way science fiction was from the 1970s and early 1980s whether the movies were flamboyantly idiosyncratic like Nicolas Roegs The Man Who Fell to Earth or commercial but unrelentingly eerie like Philip Kaufmans remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Jonathan Glazer made Under the Skin and its communicating with those and certain other movies including Stanley Kubricks but Glazer proceeds down a dark road of his own devising. The opening sequence alone is worth more than the price of a ticket. Its just rioting color and deafening soundscape but you watch and listen and wonder and wait for a concrete image to take shape and eventually something does and the shape taken is that of Scarlett Johansson whos well used in The Winter Soldier but ingeniously deployed here. An alien force of some kind assumes a body very much like Johanssons. In a skirt and jacket she stands against a white background and proceeds to teach herself to speak (in an English accent) then winds up driving a van around Scotland picking up men who cant believe their good fortune. They talk she parks and leads the man inside. She disrobes and then so does he following her but led by his erection. What ensues is brief nightmarishly serene and wondrously awful and every time it occurs you find yourself feeling worse for the men and more perplexed about the woman seducing them. For whom is she working and what do they want? Glazer demurs playing instead with the rhythm and doomy atmosphere. The film is based on a Michel Faber novel the way tomorrow is based on today. Theres a vision at work and just at the moment when you think Glazers going to open out the movie and perhaps take us to outer space -- hes the sort of director whose cosmos you want to see -- he goes the opposite direction and has the Johansson character discover humanness and feelings. Its not the happiest of awakenings. I saw Under the Skin at the Toronto Film Festival last year and people walked out. Its cruel and in its way violent. You look to Johansson for warmth sympathy or remorse and get only mild amusement at death and at the tenderness and vulnerability that lust awakens. A friend compared it to a coffee-table book and said he didnt see it going anywhere. But it just doesnt go anywhere expected. Glazers made an icy thriller of ontological and existential proportions. What does it mean to be human to be alive? In Johansson he has a star who doesnt fear being a repository of those questions. Shes at her peak as an actor right now and at the movies all of her great work lately involves the power of her body. Even in Her where she has no body her voice acquires physicality. Itd be easy for a movie to misuse her sexuality to turn her into a freak or worse. But when you watch Johansson now -- in the Marvel movies too -- she appears to have control over how shes used and looked at; she can defend herself. She and Glazer are toying with those ideas in Under the Skin. The movie is simultaneously erotic and antierotic. You watch Johansson drive that truck (those scenes are semi-improvised) and wait for a false move. But theres nothing but inquisitive serenity and red lights. In the second half of the movie lost without truly knowing it Johansson starts to break your heart. Even though shes playing an entity who has no self she succeeds at giving that sack of skin a soul.

"Captain America The Winter Soldier | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; captain-america-the-winter-soldier ) Captain America The Winter Soldier (United States 2014) April 03 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Captain America The Winter Soldier represents the first film from Marvel Studios since The Avengers to capture the true superhero spirit plenty of derring-do action adventure and an ending that doesnt fall apart. A sequel to 2011s Captain America The First Avenger this film is unlikely to convert a non-Captain America lover into a fanatic but its assembled with sufficient skill that those who enjoy this sort of motion picture will have a good time. Also unlike some of the other Avengers-interrelated movies this one doesnt feel like a glorified prequel or an unnecessary adjunct. It tells its own story and unlike with Thor 2 and Iron Man 3 we dont feel the absence of the rest of the team. Thats partially because The Winter Soldier in many ways functions as a ""mini Avengers."" In addition to Captain America (Chris Evans) the narrative incorporates Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Falcon/Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie). Also on hand is Samuel L. Jacksons irrepressible Nick Fury who has more to do here than in any of his appearances outside The Avengers. Robert Redford who reportedly took this job for his grandchildren provides a smooth suave bad guy in the person of Secretary Alexander Pierce. The first two-thirds of The Winter Soldier almost feel more like a Cold War-era espionage thriller than a superhero movie. The movie concludes with the expected special effects-laden battles and beat-the-clock action but those scenes are composed more coherently than related sequences in similar movies. And although The Winter Soldier is available in 3-D its perfectly capable of being enjoyed in the less expensive 2-D format. The movie starts with a mission in which the Captain leads a SHIELD team in boarding a pirated ship. The effort is successful but when its revealed that the true purpose of the assault is to protect SHIELD assets not save lives a rift develops between the Captain and the head of SHIELD. Later after Fury is targeted for assassination the Captain accompanied by Natasha and Sam goes on the run to discover whos behind the rot corrupting SHIELD. They learn that not only does it go to the very top but Secretary Pierce has his own superhuman agent an ex-Soviet assassin codenamed The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) working for him. Having taken down Fury The Winter Soldier targets Captain America. The Winter Soldier is effectively paced with enough action to keep things moving but not so much that it overwhelms everything. One of the keys to the films efficacy is that it takes the time to develop the relationships among the four key members. Human interaction is rarely considered an important element in ""standard"" superhero movies. The way its handled in The Winter Soldier shows why its important. The story doesnt become bogged down focusing on character development but it has enough to elevate the protagonists above the level of fast moving avatars. The narrative contains its share of unpredictable elements and isnt afraid to shake up the status quo. One wonders what kind of ripple effects this will have on the ABC-TV series about SHIELD. By the end of The Winter Soldier events seem to be pointing more forcefully toward a Captain America 3 than Avengers 2 although there is an obligatory mid-credits sequence designed to set up next summers blockbuster sequel. The most obvious asset possessed by The Winter Soldier is that it isnt plagued by the rampant sameness that characterizes so many superhero movies. The decision to hand the reins to brothers Joe and Anthony Russo whose resume consists primarily of TV work is an indication that Marvel wanted to achieve a different aesthetic for The Winter Soldier. The Russos deftness of touch is most evident in the quieter character-oriented scenes. The action sequences although capably handled unfold without distinction. The Winter Soldier is a rare high profile movie being released outside the Thanksgiving/Christmas or summer movie seasons. The lack of significant competition should give it a box office boost and it will have run its course before The Amazing Spider-Man 2 comes along in four weeks. For comic book fans this one is unlikely to leave the sour aftertaste of Iron Man 3 or Thor 2. Its effective escapist entertainment - something we need from time-to-time. (Credit watchers take note There are two ""bonus scenes."" The first which is a direct tie-in to Avengers 2 occurs about mid-way. Then theres another short snippet after the full end credits have completed. This one can be missed but its there if you elect to stay.)

Grade A Graphics ""Im 95 - Im not dead"" declares Steve Rogers aka Captain America. You can say that again. ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" injects new life into the Marvel movie universe and the superhero genre. The directing team of Anthony and Joe Russo fulfill Captain Americas potential as a unique retro hero - a World War II super-soldier brought out of suspended animation and into the 21st century - and use him to mint a fresh combination of idealism and iconoclasm. As filled out by that valiant deceptively straightforward actor Chris Evans Cap embodies an unshakable decency and an unshockable skepticism. The movie the Russos have built around him gives viewers of all ages that kid-with-a-comic-book feeling while telling a complex story of espionage and betrayal in an era of universal surveillance. The Winter Soldier controlled by a group that takes data gathering to homicidal extremes appears to be a masked Russian assassin with a metal arm. He prowls through shattered cityscapes as relentlessly as the villains do in Christopher Nolans Batman films. But ""Captain America Winter Soldier"" does a vastly better job than those movies did of generating graphic-novel tension without relinquishing big-screen romance humor and humanity. In this film when Sam Wilson aka the Falcon (Anthony Mackie) says his reason for joining Rogers crusade to stop the Winter Soldier is simply ""Captain America needs me"" its nostalgic funny and stirring - all at the same time. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce the American member of the World Security Council and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury leader of SHIELD (Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division) bring seasoned gusto to this youthful enterprise. The understated Redford and the flamboyant Jackson match up perfectly as Pierce and Fury prepare for the launch of ""Project Insight"" which will link a SHIELD satellite network to three enormous Helicarriers that will always stay in the sky. Fury brags to Rogers that this blend of technologies can ""read a terrorists DNA before he even steps out of his spider hole"" and ""neutralize threats before they even start."" Rogers still a World War II idealist objects to pre-emptive strikes. He doesnt deny that the ""greatest generation"" as Fury puts it ""did some pretty mean things"" but Rogers says ""We did it so people could be free. This isnt freedom its fear."" The rest of the film will prove him right. Right from the beginning the Russos and their writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely maintain a savvy and empathetic tone that mocks the excesses of expensive fantasy without undercutting the grandeur that goes with it. In the opening minutes its refreshing and amusing to see Rogers effortlessly lap Afghan War veteran Wilson as each takes a morning run around the glorious reflecting pool in Washington D.C.s National Mall. They bond believably over their mutual need for readjustment. Part of this movies charm is that its both literal and nimble like Captain America himself. As Rogers catches up to seven decades of cultural and social change Wilson suggests that he listen to Marvin Gayes score for the 1972 blaxploitation hit ""Trouble Man."" Rogers says ""Ill put it on the list"" - and we see that he really has a list scratched into a pocket notebook. (The list also contains ""Thai food."") Then a flashy car pulls up with Natasha Romanoff aka The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) cracking wise ""Do either of you know where the Smithsonian is? Im here to pick up a fossil."" The film may be called ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" but its a true team adventure - and key to its success is the synergy of its three stars. The always phenomenal Mackie (""The Hurt Locker"" ""The Adjustment Bureau"") has a gift for making sanity dynamic or uproarious whether Wilson asks a VA support group to decide if theyll bring the ""stuff"" of war back with them in ""a big suitcase or a little man purse"" or tells Cap and the Black Widow who shelter with him on the run that he can give them breakfast ""If you guys eat that sort of thing."" Johansson does sexy wonders with the Black Widows inscrutable unflappability - though shes even more intriguing and alluring when she lets her deadpan slip a little. In a film full of knockouts including Cobie Smulders Maria Hill and Emily VanCamps Agent 13 Johansson reigns supreme. The action takes on extra edge whenever it assumes its stars perspectives. A wavery POV shot when the Black Widow feels shaken or a view of the Winter Soldier that fixes all of Caps fears in viewers minds works wonders with shootouts and chase scenes. For directors whove never before tackled so mammoth an assignment (up to now they did their most acclaimed work for the NBC comedy ""Community"") the Russos display disarming moviemaking vision. The first time we see Cap in action is startling and comic because he races along a hijacked ship dispatching pirates at every step as speedily and casually as weve seen him run around the National Mall. When Wilson spreads his mechanical wings as Falcon the scene is exhilarating because of its timing and surprise as well as its flying effects. The movie contains some unexpected and original set pieces like the unveiling of an artificial brain made of the finest 1972 technology and a climactic aerial battle that mingles beauty and destruction. The film gets maximum impact from the unexpected dimensions of its characters Almost everyone in it has a secret or a double life. No one is more bifurcated than Captain America who still can see himself as the 90-pound weakling he was before Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) administered his super serum. Erskine made him promise ""to stay who you are - not a perfect soldier but a good man."" Whats rousing about this Captain America movie is that even in this tainted century Steve Rogers honors that pledge.

Photo Credit Marvel Studios / MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The first Avenger takes on terrorists super-soldiers and something like the NSA surveillance program. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE The action is bruising the politics merely glancing in this superhero sequel which finds an accessible middle ground between ""The Dark Knight"" and say ""Mission Impossible."" CAST Chris Evans Scarlett Johansson Robert Redford Anthony Mackie LENGTH 216 Greatest Generation hottie Steve Rogers returns in ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" now in his 90s but well preserved thanks to a cryogenic sleep. He keeps a handwritten list of new things to try including ""Thai food"" and ""Nirvana (band)"" but theres a more troubling development for this World War II veteran a surveillance-obsessed America that is beginning to resemble the fascist regime he once fought. ""The Winter Soldier"" picks up shortly after 2011s ""Captain America The First Avenger"" but the films are vastly different. The first was a golden-hued romance directed with yesteryear style by Joe Johnston (""The Rocketeer""). The sequel is newfangled gadget-happy and paced like a globe-hopping thriller by directors Anthony and Joe Russo (""You Me and Dupree""). Its ripped-from-the-headlines plot is impressively up to date and the action is tougher -- and better -- than most superhero fare. But Ill just say it ""The First Avenger"" was a work of art while ""The Winter Soldier"" is serviceable entertainment.

Chris Evans still shines as Captain America the true-blue soldier whose main loyalty is to the buddy next to him. He doesnt trust the slippery agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) but theyll have to work together after their agency S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised. Joined by newcomer The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) theyll battle the Winter Soldier a metal-armed assassin. His sad soulful eyes belong to Romanian actor Sebastian Stan who does a lot with a near-silent role. ""The Winter Solider"" ventures into political minefields but ends up mostly pirouetting. Samuel L. Jackson as superhero ringleader Nick Fury delivers Rumsfeldian aphorisms (""S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as it is not as we would like it to be"") while the government begins preemptively targeting ""undesirables."" Captain America provides the voice of constitutional conscience ""I thought the punishment came after the crime."" Into this cartoon version of realpolitik strolls a terrific Robert Redford as World Security Council chief Alexander Pierce whose silver temples and platinum-gray suit ooze wealth and wile. Redford provides some serious counterbalance in this otherwise fluffy flick though hes also spoofing his liberal-lefty persona and winking at his classic 1975 conspiracy-thriller ""Three Days of the Condor."" (To say more would be a spoiler.) MoviesVote Are these superheroes iconic or dull? Missing from ""The Winter Soldier"" are the entrancing visuals and old-fashioned heart that made the first film such a distinctive entry in the Marvel canon. Captain America as he must is keeping up with the times. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT The first Avenger takes on terrorists super-soldiers and something like the NSA surveillance program.

"Captain America meets modern-day paranoia in The Winter Soldier review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCaptain America meets modern-day paranoia in The Winter Soldier reviewIts gung-ho vs. shadow as the unthawed avenger gets wise in a hurry in Captain America The Winter Soldier a blockbuster that tweaks the brain while dazzling the eye.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 3 2014Captain America The Winter SoldierStarring Chris Evans Samuel L. Jackson Scarlett Johansson Robert Redford Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. 136 minutes. Opens April 3 at major theatres. PGIn the new Captain America sequelour unthawed avenger visits the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. to see an exhibit devoted to his Second World War exploits.Its the only thing in the film that sniffs of embalming fluid. Marvels corniest and most archaic superhero otherwise gets a thorough upgrade this time out in thinking if not in costume learning through multiple revelations that trust is more elusive than peace.Article Continued BelowSubtitled The Winter Soldier a nod to the Captains mysterious new cold-blooded nemesis the movie comes wrapped not only in the Stars and Stripes but also Watergate-meets-9/11 paranoia from influences like The Parallax View and Three Days of the Condor the latter especially so thanks to the forceful and nuanced presence of Robert Redford.Chris Evans impressively updates the character (if not the costume) of Captain America.  (Marvel)  Captain America gets an assist from fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson).  (Marvel)  Its gung-ho vs. shadow as Captain America gets wise in a hurry and while being pursued. The contrast makes for the best kind of blockbuster comic-book movie tweaking the brain while dazzling the eye.When we first rejoin Cap (Chris Evans) a.k.a. Steve Rogers hes still coming to grips with the 21st century. Having fended off the Nazi-allied HYDRA criminal organization in origin film Captain America The First Avenger hes now engaged in more current heroism. Things like stopping pirates in the Indian Ocean aided by his sexy (and sneaky) fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) a.k.a. Black Widow of The Avengers alternate universe.Cap is as valorous as ever if also a little too virginal. He brushes off dating advice from Natasha and admits to his new military pal Sam (Anthony Mackie) that he still needs to bone up on such pop-cult totems as the music of Nirvana and Marvin Gaye and such movies as Rocky.More vexing to this Greatest Generation do-gooder are the flexible ethics of S.H.I.E.L.D. The agencys high-priority Project Insight is a gussied-up drone missile program devised to take out evildoers before they do evil (shades of Minority Report). It finds targets by violating civil liberties on a global scale -- much like what Americas National Security Agency wiretappers are actually doing -- and this doesnt sit well with the righteous Captain.""This isnt freedom"" he tells S.H.I.E.L.D. boss Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). ""This is fear.""Cap has a point one even the ferocious Fury can see. But when Fury seeks permission from his government overseer (Redford) to hit the pause button on Project Insight the good guys barely have a chance to move before the bad guys storm in -- including a one-man wrecking crew with face mask and mechanical arm known as the Winter Soldier.And who really are the bad guys this time? Thats the beauty of the script by returning writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely brought to the screen with malevolent gusto by sibling directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo who were last seen helming considerably tamer material with You Me and Dupree.While the Russos prove themselves more than capable at handling the films many muscular set pieces -- an elevator ambush scene is a highlight -- theyre also dab hands at building a mood of unease and distrust.It gets almost supernaturally spooky at times -- is that echoes of the Twin Peaks theme in Henry Jackmans score? -- and cinematographer Trent Opaloch imparts a similar sense of totalitarian menace he also brought to the compromised cityscapes of Elysium and District 9.And while things get a little too complicated midway through what keeps us grounded and interested is the continuing education of Captain America whom Evans impressively frees from his comic book origins.""Its kind of hard to trust somebody when you dont know who that somebody really is"" he confides to an ally.Cap is learning the hard way much like the superpower he symbolizes that an imperfect modern world doesnt offer perfectly moral choices to complex problems.

Watch a clip from the film ""Captain America The Winter Soldier."" Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) struggles to embrace his role in the modern world and battles a new threat from old history the Soviet agent known as the Winter Soldier. (Photo Disney) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com April 3 2014 156 p.m. ET With ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" Marvel has won a rebirth trifecta. Originally a product of Project Rebirth a World War II experiment that turned frail Steve Rogers into a supersoldier Captain America was reborn--though I thought stillborn--in 2011 as a stand-alone screen hero in the would-be epic ""Captain America The First Avenger."" Just about every shortcoming of that film--the ponderous pace the uncertain tone the variable acting--has been fixed and then some by ""The Winter Soldier"" in which Steve played by Chris Evans is re-reborn as a charmingly retro fighter for freedom in the face of a vast conspiracy that manages to feel fresh and modern despite some familiar machinations. The modern world remains mysterious to Steve who in Marvel mythology spent a good part of his 95 years frozen in a block of Arctic ice. (His to-do list of things to catch up on includes Thai food Steve Jobs and ""Star Wars""/""Star Trek"" with the former crossed out as a sign of his progress.) Mystery turns to menace when he discovers that the espionage and law-enforcement agency S.H.I.E.L.D. is pushing the country he loves closer to being a surveillance state. ""This isnt freedom this is fear"" Steve says when hes shown an astonishing array of weaponry including satellites that can he is told ""read a terrorists DNA before he steps out of his spider hole."" The rationale for all that comes later. ""Societys at a tipping point between order and chaos"" says Alexander Pierce a suave senior member of the agencys leadership and you know from his tightly wound demeanor that hes not going to come down on chaoss side. ENLARGE Chris Evans as Captain America Marvel In a piece of casting thats sly as well as smart Pierce is played by Robert Redford. The directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo have said they wanted to make a 1970s-style political-conspiracy thriller along the lines of ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""All the Presidents Men"" both starring Mr. Redford. Thats essentially what theyve done with Captain America at the center of the often awesome action. Awesome doesnt overstate the case for some of the action sequences especially a climactic battle in the skies over Washington Its as if the immense warplanes in Hayao Miyazakis animated classic ""Castle in the Sky"" had come to life or the kind of heightened life thats conferred by digital effects at their most inspired. The line between live and animated is usually blurred by productions like this but the car chases are clearly live and the movies most conventional element. Conventional understates the case; they look like a compendium of every hurtling thundering spark-showering crashathon from the 1970s through ""The Matrix"" and beyond. Similarly the plot turns on a traditional trackdown--the formidable forces of a S.H.I.E.L.D. gone bad in superheated pursuit of Captain America and his cohorts Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson (who as youll see has another strong movie opening this week) and Anthony Mackies Falcon who sprouts a pair of wings that Icarus would have envied. Indeed the whole movie with its looming techno-apocalypse was constructed as if all those James Bond films with similar threats had never existed. What makes ""The Winter Soldier"" so enjoyable though and what will make it so profitable is its emotional bandwidth--all the vivid nuanced life lived by its characters in between their frenzied escapades. Black Widow is winning in more ways than one. ""Was that your first kiss since 1945?"" she asks the hero after a teasingly brief smooch. Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury the beleaguered--to say the least--director of S.H.I.E.L.D. finds time to tell an affecting story about his working-class grandfather. And Mr. Evans makes Captain America such a likable guy as well as an old-school patriot that he put me in mind of a very old-fashioned word to describe him. Hes doughty. In a movie that deserves him. Under the Skin Watch a clip from the film ""Under the Skin."" Scarlett Johansson portrays an alien seductress that preys upon hitchhikers in Scotland. (Photo/Video A24 Films) Jonathan Glazers ""Under the Skin"" holds you in a state of suspense tinged with dread from the very first image on the screen. The image could not be more basic to the medium a spot of light that grows as it approaches while accompanied by inscrutable but urgent sounds. All of this and the eerily odd graphics that follow serve as shorthand signals of whats to come alien arrival danger or menace probably something bad surely nothing good. Strictly speaking the first image is preceded by a single name on the screen Scarlett Johansson--that must be a first for opening credits. She plays a woman who has no name and thats appropriate because as the movie has already signaled she isnt really a woman. Exactly what she--or it--is and the purpose of her journey is never made clear and the solemn tone sometimes flirts with absurdity. But the filmmaker an Englishman who also shoots commercials and videos decided wisely to clarify from the outset what shes not since watching a beautiful woman take form is only one of the movies attractions. ""Under the Skin"" is about seduction and predation The womans victims meet surreal fates that should be seen not described. Yet its also about seeing and hearing this world of ours through an alien sensibility--the film set in Scotland becomes an adventure in perception--and watching its ambiguous heroine learn what it is for better and much worse to be human. (One joke perhaps intentional for the U.S. market is that this visitor from elsewhere in the cosmos is much better than we are at understanding Scottish accents.) ENLARGE Scarlett Johansson in Under the Skin A24 Films In his previous features ""Sexy Beast"" (a fine noirish thriller about love and violence) and ""Birth"" (a boy tries to convince a woman hes the reincarnation of her late husband) Mr. Glazer showed himself to be an accomplished stylist; many critics of ""Birth"" would say a stylist if nothing else. ""Under the Skin"" may sound like another version of such sci-fi dramas as ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" and ""Starman"" but its distinguished--and I do mean distinguished--by its stripped-back style. Theres no plot as such only the womans dreamlike progression through dark landscapes seen in extreme long shots and her presence in interiors that are often depicted with Japanese spareness in static wide shots. Much of this is fascinating as far as it goes but it wouldnt go as far as it does into drama were it not for Ms. Johanssons wonderfully strange performance. Its not a movie-star turn. Shes there to serve the filmmakers purposes by being self-effacing but--an extraordinary feat--she is mesmerizing at the same time. Her marvelous voice lends a light musicality to her spare lines. Trusting her material she doesnt try to be seductive; the affable questions her character asks of men she meets--whats your name where are you going--are more than enough to draw them into her orbit. This life forms eyes are on the life forms around her--pedestrians on the streets of Glasgow young males in states of arousal an ant twitching its antennae a modern-day Sir Walter Raleigh keeping her dry by carrying her across a puddle. And our eyes are on her on the prowl her expression imperturbable and her feelings unreadable as she drives a van stops to ask her questions gets out to size up her victims and stands in front of a mirror to study her body or whosever body it once was. The Unknown Known Watch a clip from the film ""The Unknown Known."" Former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld discusses his career from his days as a congressman in the early 1960s to planning the invasion of Iraq in 2003. (Photo/Video RADiUS-TWC) More than a decade ago the filmmaker Errol Morris made a haunting and important documentary called ""The Fog of War."" His subject was Robert S. McNamara who had been secretary of defense under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson during the Vietnam War. At the age of 85 Mr. McNamara admitted even insisted that the U.S. had misconstrued the nature of that war and he spoke eloquently of human fallibility. The subject of Mr. Morriss new documentary is Donald Rumsfeld who served as secretary of defense under President George W. Bush during the Iraq War and its turbulent aftermath. This film which might have been called ""The Fog of Words"" isnt haunting but dismaying. Mr. Rumsfeld is as always articulate energetic and self-confident. Yet his words suggest a paradox--a restless mind with no discernible gift for self-reflection. The films title derives from Mr. Rumsfelds fondness for arranging words in provocative formulations. In a 2004 memo one of the thousands that came to be called ""snowflakes"" he wrote ""There are known knowns. There are known unknowns. There are unknown unknowns. But there are also unknown knowns. That is to say things that you think you know that it turns out you did not."" Confusing? Yes but eventually revealing. The last part of the memo seems to have been meant as a warning about jumping to conclusions--that is to say the Bush administrations convincing itself that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. Toward the end of the film though Mr. Rumsfeld offers a different definition of ""unknown knowns."" This time he talks about ""things that you possibly may know that you dont know you know."" Mr. Morris a liberal who keeps his skepticism in the open challenges the logic of this more hopeful definition. ""But the memo doesnt say that"" the filmmaker contends. ""It says we know less not more than we think we do."" Mr. Rumsfeld takes a moment to reconsider his wording then says cryptically ""Yeah I think that memo is backwards. I think its closer to what I said here than that."" The point is not that he has been sandbagged or embarrassed because he doesnt seem to feel that he has; the exchange takes the tone of a lively discussion of semantics. Whats so striking is the abstract nature of his discourse; whats so chilling is his dispassion. At one point Mr. Morris asks if there are lessons to be learned from Vietnam. ""That some things dont work out"" Mr. Rumsfeld replies. ""If thats a lesson."" Thats unknowing made known. Breathe In Watch a clip from the film ""Breathe In."" When a foreign exchange student arrives in a small upstate New York town she challenges the dynamics of her host familys relationships and alters their lives forever. (Photo/Video Cohen Media Group) Music can make for great moments in movies and one of them graces this new feature by Drake Doremus. The scene is a high-school music class in upstate New York. Sophie a bright and beautiful English exchange student played by Felicity Jones has been asked to play a piano piece of her choosing by the teacher Keith; hes played by Guy Pearce. Sophie does so reluctantly; an accomplished pianist--think Lolita at a keyboard--shes conflicted about the prospect of a concert career. Beginning softly she works her way into a Chopin ballade. Within a few measures though she is hurling fortissimo arpeggios with wild passion. Whats that about? Ill say only that shes living with Keith and his family and that Keith a concert musician when he isnt teaching reciprocates Sophies passion at first only on his cello. Back in 2011 Mr. Doremus and his writing partner Ben York Jones released ""Like Crazy"" a lovely little movie that also co-starred Ms. Jones. In that one she was a vivacious young Englishwoman in her last year at a California college. Shes a luminous presence on screen and at the age of 30 has more than gotten away with this odd progression from college senior to high-school senior; Id be happy to see her playing a middle-school student next time. And Mr. Doremus is an exceptional director of actors; almost every scene in ""Breathe In"" comes alive with or without the help of music. But the film needs more help than it gets from the script which turns on facile coincidence and dwindles in originality as it moves toward its climax. Next time around lets hope this gifted filmmaker hangs his characters lives on stronger dramatic bones. Island of Lemurs Madagascar Watch a clip from the film ""Island of Lemurs Madagascar"" a documentary that follows Dr. Patricia C. Wrights mission to help lemurs the highly evolved creatures who are now highly endangered. Narrated by Morgan Freeman. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) This 3-D IMAX documentary puts its best paw forward with a funny and exuberant title sequence followed by 40 minutes of phenomenal footage of lemurs in their native habitat of Madagascar. Its the sole and shrinking habitat for these primates who are the soul of zestfulness and great fun to watch until you realize their dire plight. Lemurs came to Madagascar from Africa 60 million years ago. Human beings got there 2000 years ago. And which of the two arrivals has proved to be smarter? Well 90% of the islands forests have been destroyed and the lemurs didnt do it. Ive said it before but once again the huge-screen IMAX format can also be the most intimate of movie media. The close-ups in this film produced by Drew Fellman and directed and photographed by David Douglas put their subjects virtually in your lap. The lemurs look startled because of their wide eyes adapted for night vision. I must have looked startled too polarized glasses perched on my nose and barely resisting the temptation to reach out a few inches to try to touch the furry creatures. For now ""Island of Lemurs Madagascar"" will play only in such specialized venues as science museums though wider distribution may follow. The film is organized around the work of Patricia C. Wright an American primatologist who was a prime mover for the establishment of Madagascars Ranomafana National Park now a refuge for at least 15 species of lemurs. The music is shamelessly entertaining and the warmth of Morgan Freemans narration conveys the possibility that for all the imminent peril the lemurs of this enchanted forest still have a fighting chance. In Appreciation ENLARGE Lorenz Semple Jr. at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2008. Film Servis Festival Karlovy Vary Lorenzo Semple Jr. who died late last week at the age of 91 reinvented himself in his 80s as a delightfully eccentric sporadically irascible and formidably knowledgeable online movie critic. If you want to see him in that mode praising or trashing with his cherished friend and co-critic the producer Marcia Nasatir check out ""Reel Geezers"" on YouTube. If you want to see or re-see what he did before his self-declared geezerdom--as one of the most original writers in network television and feature films--you can start with his creation of the original ""Batman"" on TV; he wrote the first four episodes and remained a story consultant for the run of the show. Then you can move on to distinctive features he wrote or co-wrote including ""Three Days of the Condor"" ""The Parallax View"" ""Papillon"" the Dino De Laurentiis version of ""King Kong"" and ""Pretty Poison."" My introduction to his big-screen work came on a rainy October afternoon in 1968 with a call from Pauline Kael who lived up the block from me on Central Park West. She wanted to know if Id heard of a movie called ""Pretty Poison."" I had not and she hadnt either. But it was playing Pauline had discovered at a theater on Broadway and 96th Street; did I want to split a cab and take a look? We were the only two people in the theater and we were startled by what we saw--a superb little black comedy sharply written by Lorenzo and starring Tuesday Weld and Anthony Perkins that 20th Century-Fox had dumped into a few neighborhood theaters without advance screenings. Pauline went immediately to her office at The New Yorker I went to mine at Newsweek and we both rushed rave reviews into print. I got to know Lorenzo later in California and though we were never close friends I always enjoyed his trenchant takes on the business he sometimes deplored and steadfastly loved. As much as Ill miss him Ill savor his work all the more whenever I go back for pure pleasure to movies that carry his indelible stamp.

Comments (4) click to enlarge Captain America The Winter Soldier Video Rated PG-13  136 minutes  2014 This sequel to Captain America The First Avenger (2011) trades that films 1940s setting for a contemporary one and its genial tone for a blithe cynicism more typical of Marvel Studios. The convoluted story involves the sabotage of SHIELD--the secret agency of Captain America (Chris Evans) and his superhero peers--by another organization thats rooted in Nazi Germany. Unless youre intimately familiar with the so-called Marvel universe (or you really love CG explosions) little of this will resonate; directors Joe and Anthony Russo race through everything but the special-effects set pieces assuming that fans will compensate for the lack of nuance by drawing on their knowledge of the comic books. The impressive supporting cast includes Anthony Mackie Scarlett Johansson Frank Grillo Robert Redford and Samuel L. Jackson.

Photo Walt Disney Pictures Captain America The Winter Soldier review Halfhearted 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Captain America The Winter Soldier Action. Starring Chris Evans Scarlett Johansson Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Redford. Directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo. (PG-13. 136 minutes.) With all the money in the world behind it - with years and years of similar movies in the pipeline - the comic book superhero genre is already looking tired and going through the motions. The latest ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" has the usual overlong running time the halfhearted feints in the direction of human feeling and the obligatory action sequences that are big without being either exciting or particularly legible. One action scene gets so confusing and jumbled that the question has to be written into the script ""How do we know the good guys from the bad guys?"" The answer ""If theyre shooting at us theyre the bad guys."" Maybe. Or maybe those are the real heroes trying to end the movie. For all of us. ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" a sequel to 2011 ""Captain America The First Avenger"" is especially hampered by the Winter Soldier in its subtitle. It is a familiar and yet always frustrating feature in action films the invincible character who comes on every 15 minutes to beat up the hero. In this case every time we see this muscle-bound fellow with long dark hair and a mask we know were in for an extended fight culminating in a stalemate - in other words with nothing happening. Related Stories Goodbye World movie review annoying apocalypse Nymphomaniac Vol. 2 review Weak sequel to weak original On My Way review Deneuve film open thought provoking The Missing Picture by Rithy Panh review a memoir Movie review Raid 2 a cracking good time However the new ""Captain America"" has two touches of originality that take it a little above the ordinary. First it has Robert Redford as a ruthless character probably the first villain he has played since his days in live television. Its fun hearing that familiar Redford voice which always sounds like the soul of reason espousing the most outlandish ideas in his usual clear and simple way ""To build a really better world sometimes means tearing the old world down."" Villains as heroes Redford is actor enough to know that villains even comic book villains dont see themselves as evil. They see themselves as heroes willing to make sacrifices for the greater good. The only catch is that theyre never the ones who are doing the sacrificing. The movies other claim to fame is that the entity Captain America is fighting isnt some outside power but factions within the United States government. If you think of popular movies as takers of the national pulse thats an interesting development. Following 9/11 our action movies were authoritarian. Now with ""Captain America"" as with ""Robocop"" were seeing a new strain something either liberal or libertarian depending on how you look at it. Enhanced but still human These ideas make particular sense within the Captain America framework. For those who didnt see the first installment hes an American soldier from World War II - scientifically enhanced but still human and vulnerable - who was frozen for almost 70 years. Now at 95 he looks no more than 30 but he has the sensibility of a man from another generation. Coming from a world in which bad guys conveniently wore swastikas and goose-stepped down the street he finds himself puzzled by modern shades of gray. How should he feel about people who tell him they just want to keep us safe? How should he feel about people scanning your e-mails phone calls SAT scores and employment history - all for the greater good? How should he feel about security technology that can predict dangerous activity before the perpetrator even gets the idea? And how should we feel about that? This is the idea spine of ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" a frame for a better movie than the one that was actually made but at least no one could call this movie stupid. In the experience ""Captain America"" is simply what one might imagine it to be going in - watchable and reasonably entertaining the product of two non-action directors Anthony and Joe Russo who set out to make an action movie. Now theyve made one no worse and no better than anybody elses. At his best Chris Evans as Captain America embodies the pain of someone living in the wrong era but he can only struggle when the movie demands he feel emotions that are manufactured not earned such as his deep sympathy for the Winter Soldier or his bonding with his new best friend (Anthony Mackie). Theres also no getting around the fact that Captain America is as dull as Batman when it comes to combat. How many times can we see him getting into fistfights - to the accompaniment of a drum machine on the soundtrack - before checking out? And though theres no questioning the acting or star wattage of Scarlett Johansson as Natasha as superheroes go she looks as delicate as a porcelain teacup. Somebody also might want to think about spending more than 10 minutes on the script. On two occasions a character has to stand up state the movies point of view and persuade a group of people on a course of action. Twice the characters make arguments that would persuade nobody.

"Captain America The Winter Soldier reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Scarlett Johansson Is the Best Thing About Captain America The Winter Soldier Scarlett Johansson Is the Best Thing About Captain America The Winter Soldier Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 3 2014 1253 PM A Mild Winter Scarlett Johansson enlivens the pleasant but unremarkable new Captain America. By Dana Stevens Scarlett Johansson in Captain America The Winter Soldier. Photo courtesy Marvel Studios After youve seen Captain America The Winter Soldier listen to Slates Dana Stevens and Forrest Wickman discuss it on the Spoiler Special podcast. The subtitle of Marvels new Captain America The Winter Soldier comes to us via the famous opening passage in Thomas Paines Revolutionary War pamphlet ""The Crisis"" ""These are the times that try mens souls The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of the country but he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of man and woman."" Paine never mentions the winter soldier by name--his existence is to be inferred from that of the summer soldier a military fair-weather friend whose fraudulent loyalty is exposed in times of adversity. Two centuries later in the early 1970s the organization of Vietnam Veterans Against the War held a series of war-crimes hearings that became known as the Winter Soldier Investigation the idea being that he who truly loves his country will be brave enough to tell hard truths about it. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Advertisement In the new Captain America--sequel to 2011s The First Avenger--the moral valence of Paines weather metaphor has been reversed. The character nicknamed the Winter Soldier isnt the steadfast naive Captain America aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) but his treacherous nemesis--whose real identity I wont reveal here but who has emerged far less spiritually intact than Steve has from ""the times that try mens souls."" What do revolutionary propaganda and Vietnam-era protest have to do with a competently assembled corporate product like the new Captain America? Nothing probably; the Winter Soldier name comes from the well-regarded Marvel comic-book series by Ed Brubaker who has said in an interview that he first heard the term in the context of the 70s hearings learned much later it came from Paine and borrowed it less for the historical associations than for the sound ""Its a very evocative name for a Captain America villain."" Im just vamping trying to find my way into a discussion of a movie that precisely because its such a competently assembled corporate product seems as impervious to analysis or criticism as its heros all-powerful concentric-circle shield is to bonks from bad guys. But among the various interrelated Marvel comic myths that have been converging over the past few years into a unified Avengers cosmology (Iron Man Thor The Incredible Hulk etc.) Captain America does feel like the one thats the most concerned with taking a longer view of American history if only because the loyal and patriotic Steve Rogers who spent the years between World War II and the present day frozen in suspended animation is a kind of reanimated fossil. Steves status as a gung-ho mid-20th-century good guy in a morally ambiguous 21st-century world provides this pleasant if unremarkable blockbuster with a modicum of ethical heft and a few sly jokes. In the opening scene we catch a glimpse of a notebook in which the recently resurrected hero has scribbled some notes on cultural touchstones hes missed out on during his long slumber The list includes Thai food disco and Marvin Gayes ""Trouble Man."" That last is recommended to him by his Army buddy Sam Wilson (appealingly played by The Hurt Lockers Anthony Mackie) who later reveals himself to be a fellow superdude the mechanical-winged Falcon. But there are some less fun elements of contemporary American life that Steve will soon have to grapple with omnipresent government surveillance drone warfare and inter-spy-agency skullduggery. He and Sam accompanied by Scarlett Johanssons Natasha Romanoff aka the Black Widow will soon be on the run unable to trust even the organization--S.H.I.E.L.D. led by Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury--thats purporting to protect them. In its imagining of a corrupt and untrustworthy government honeycombed with secret nefarious conspiracies The Winter Soldier at times resembles a cleaner less gritty version of the paranoid political thriller of the 70s in which a disillusioned hero goes rogue to discover the truth. So its fitting that the movie co-stars conspiracy-thriller veteran Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce a suave imperturbable diplomat who may or may not have the best interests of S.H.I.E.L.D. at heart. Redford is an unexpected and bracing presence in a movie of this kind; his presence along with Jacksons lend the movie a current of brainy countercultural hip that the script (by Stephen McFeely and Christopher Markus who also wrote both the last Captain America movie and Thor The Dark World) doesnt always earn. It doesnt make sense to review a superhero movie without mentioning the action sequences but the sad truth is the Niagara Falls worth of movie budgets expended on blockbuster special effects are now wasted on this white-flag-waving viewer. I can barely distinguish or remember who fell off what spaceship onto what exploding aircraft carrier from movie to movie so ubiquitous and overextended and loud have such scenes become. To its credit The Winter Soldier (directed by brothers Joe and Anthony Russo) doesnt casually exploit 9/11 by destroying the skyline of a major city. But for a movie that often shoots for a lighthearted sunny tone it has a hell of a high body count with our heroes routinely storming into enclosed spaces and mowing down everyone in sight. The most memorable element of The Winter Soldier besides Redford is probably Scarlett Johansson whose dryly funny Natasha at times comes perilously close to being ... a well-developed female character? She never appears in a full-body catsuit that I can recall she cracks actual jokes rather than just reacting to those made by her male counterparts and she has an amusingly high opinion of her own superheroic abilities frequently comparing her intelligence favorably to that of the shield-wielding hunk at her side. Evans continues to be engaging as the refreshingly unbrooding Steve and all around The Winter Soldier cheerfully and efficiently does its job doing whatever Marvel movies are meant to do--make you look forward to the next one I guess. In the closing credits the full-cast hoedown The Avengers Age of Ultron (coming in summer 2015) gets a teaser as does the further-out Captain America 3 and I have to admit that they both show some promise. But I might feel differently once this long cold winter turns to summer the time that tries movie critics souls. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Marvel-Disney photo HOEP Jackson has never been as loose a superhero as when he was the animated Fro-Zone in Pixars ""The Incredibles."" But its as Nick Fury in another Disney world the Avengers cinematic universe that Jackson has to deftly strike that perfect soldiers balance booming with vocal solidity while retaining some of his liquid charisma. The good news about ""Captain America the Winter Soldier"" is that its not another superhero fantasy about an evil overlord seeking a ring hammer idol or gemstone that will give him unlimited power. Its a movie about the real world of terrorism and surveillance where power is in the hands of business-suited bureaucrats. The bad news is that it was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo whose previous movie was the 2006 slacker comedy ""You Me and Dupree"" -- not exactly a showcase for big ideas and special effects.On paper this sequel has some promising elements but on screen it retreats from the very issues that it raises and on a shelf next to ""Captain America The First Avenger"" ""The Winter Soldier"" is pale.In the 2011 film movie audiences were introduced to Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) a 98-pound weakling in 1940s Brooklyn who follows his friend Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) into the Army. Rogers is a notably reluctant warrior with an all-American sense of fair play but a top-secret lab transforms him into a superhuman Nazi-killing machine. Near the end of the movie he went into a decades-long deep freeze only to be awakened in the present. In ""The Avengers"" he joined an all-star team to save New York from one of those aforementioned evil overlords. Now he works with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and the peacekeeping organization S.H.I.E.L.D.Under the direction of Furys old friend Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents are advocating pre-emptive strikes against dissidents using a flotilla of airborne ""heli-carriers."" The power struggle knocks Fury out of commission and leaves Rogers on the run from a mysterious masked cyborg dubbed the Winter Soldier. Rogers only two allies are ex-KGB assassin Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson vamping it up) and special-forces veteran Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie). Theres a lot of hand-to-hand conflict in this movie but relatively little heart-to-heart discussion about what it all means. Although Rogers visits a Smithsonian exhibit about his super-soldier transformation its too easy to forget that he is a time-traveler in a confusing new century. He visits wartime love Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) in a hospital but that subplot gets discarded. As usual for a superhero movie the pyrotechnic finale has little sense of civilian consequences. While the hovering heli-carriers explode over the Potomac no terrified townies point toward the sky let alone debate how we got into this mess. Garry Shandling has two scenes as a scheming politician and Pierce presides over hologram meetings of world leaders but the populace that presumably needs security is shortchanged.With his glorified Frisbee and good-guy smile Evans is engaging but ""The Winter Soldier"" might be stronger with a little less Captain and a little more America.What ""Captain America the Winter Soldier""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 216  Content Intense sequence of violence action and gunplay Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson reprise their roles as Captain America/Steve Rogers and Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff in ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" the newest installment in the Avengers superheroes series. (Zade Rosenthal) By Ann Hornaday April 3 2014 Follow AnnHornaday Crash boom bang. ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" brings back one of the most mild-mannered superheroes of the Marvel Avengers franchise the clean-cut square-jawed Steve Rogers whose quiet determination and commitment to decency -- oh and preternatural speed and strength -- allow him to speak softly and carry a big shield. But in this the second installment featuring Rogers and his titular alter ego Steve is forced into all manner of chaotic cacophonous action. A baggy at times brutal conglomeration of surprisingly deep character development and aggressively percussive action ""The Winter Soldier"" is a comic-book movie only in its provenance. (The character was created by Marvel back in 1941.) In its relentless violence and dark political subtext this might be the most grown-up Avengers episode yet. ""The Winter Soldier"" finds Rogers -- now fully defrosted after being cryogenically preserved during World War II -- jogging around the Mall; its been two years since the near- destruction of New York City (the climactic set piece of shared-universe lollapalooza ""The Avengers"") and hes still trying to get up to speed on such late-20th-century developments as grunge music and Thai food. After striking up a friendly conversation with fellow runner and war veteran Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) Steve is picked up by Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) Theyve got a job to do this time involving nonchalantly saving a ship and the lives of the S.H.I.E.L.D. operatives who have been taken hostage on it. Just another days work for the savior of the Western World but straight-arrow Steve suspects that somethings up when Natasha seems more concerned with saving the ships computer data to her flash drive than fighting the Algerian terrorists swarming the boat. It turns out Steve has reason for suspicion as ""The Winter Soldier"" proves that even back at S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters in what seems to be Northern Virginias coolest -- if vaguely fascistic -- office complex no one can be trusted. One of the great strengths of the Avengers mega-franchise has been its canny casting and ""The Winter Soldier"" is no exception Chris Evans once again brings a clean-cut straight-shooting air of simplicity to Steves principled paragon even evincing a whiff or two of prissy self-righteousness along the way. Happily directors Joe and Anthony Russo working from a script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have decided to make ""The Winter Soldier"" something of a two-hander between Steve and Natasha who as portrayed by Johansson continually threatens to steal the entire movie with her slinky martial arts moves and sultry smoky-voiced one-liners. (If Hollywood was waiting for proof that the Black Widow was ready for her own installment here it is. Get cracking fellas.) Other beloved S.H.I.E.L.D. figures are on hand here as well including Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) and viewers might want to brace themselves for a loss that rivals the death of Marias old work buddy Clark Greggs still-lamented Phil Coulson. But its the newcomers who make the biggest impact in ""The Winter Soldier"" especially Robert Redford who plays Furys longtime colleague and World Security Council leader Alexander Pierce with cagey charm and cool reticence; and Mackie who convincingly introduces a new character the Falcon with appealing unforced charisma and the grace of a titanium Icarus. For a script that presumably has been in development for more than a few years ""The Winter Soldier"" uncannily taps into anxieties having to do not only with post-9/11 arguments about security and freedom but also Obama-era drone strikes and Snowden-era privacy. Indeed there are moments that in their taut writing and ingenious staging recall the icy-hot paranoid thrillers that Redford himself made back in the 1970s. But lest audiences think that ""The Winter Soldier"" will fall into the trap of taking itself too seriously the filmmakers make sure that for every serious motif theres at least one joke (a scene set in a bunker full of 70s-era computer equipment is particularly piquant as is a terrifically legit-looking Air and Space Museum exhibition devoted to Steves career) and one-and-a-half scenes of pulverizing knuckle-splitting action. At a running time of over two hours ""The Winter Soldier"" easily could have trimmed its long-winded action set pieces extravaganzas of promiscuous gunplay all-engulfing fireballs and loud lashings of shattered glass that begin to feel repetitive by the films Big Finish a fight that plays out with over-the-top violence thats both cartoonish and repellently brutalizing. For all of its overstatement though ""The Winter Soldier"" is superbly made and well-acted neatly setting up the next few installments with just the right enticing sense of ongoing mystery. As ever perhaps the biggest lingering question has to do with whether S.H.I.E.L.D.s sharp-elbowed superheroes will work together as a functional team or go their own idiosyncratic ways. As ""The Winter Soldier"" proves often with a punishing vengeance just because you share a universe doesnt necessarily mean you play well with others.   PG-13. At area theaters. Contains intense sequences of violence gunplay and action throughout. 136 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

All Rights Reserved. So the summer movie season has started when most of us havent put away the winter overcoats yet and thats only the beginning of the cognitive dissonance involved with ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" the latest spectacle-sequel from the ever-metastasizing Marvel Comics empire. Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo the duo behind the TV series ""Community"" from a screenplay by the powerhouse writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely the second movie about Captain America offers an intriguing departure from superhero-flick orthodoxy but also one thats steeped in genuine comic-book lore. With its portrayal of an idealistic patriot uprooted from the Greatest Generation set against a super-secret government agency run amok it means to be highly contemporary while enlisting itself in the classic tradition of switcheroo espionage thrillers.Problem is ""The Winter Soldier"" turns out to be more interesting in theory than in practice more fun to talk about than to sit through. Thats a subjective response of course; it might be fairer to say that the effect of the film is very different from the alleged ideas behind it. I can tell you that Markus and McFeely (working from a story by Marvel veteran Ed Brubaker) have written a paranoid parable about the national-security state in which the most revered institution in the Marvel universe turns out to have been corrupted from within. That makes the movie sound ""subversive"" or something but this purported anti-fascist tale is delivered in high-fascist incoherent action-movie style as a dizzying disorienting farrago of secret weapons ripped bods lonely masculinity and individual acts of bravado. The signal-to-noise ratio on ""The Winter Soldier"" is all messed up and the net effect is self-canceling. I enjoyed the movie while I was watching it or I thought I did but all thats left is an irritating buzz.I know I know Put down the schoolbooks and chillax Schopenhauer. Its a movie But even if we dial back the question to the level of whether this film will rock your jock and provide some empty-headed thrills I think the answer is closer to ""kind of"" than ""abso-freakin-lutely."" I liked the dense plotting of the script - which will require some gymnastics to talk about without spoilers -- and Chris Evans makes an agreeable stranger-in-a-strange-land hero a chemically enhanced super-warrior whos been on ice since the end of World War II and is still trying to catch up on consumer culture. When Evans Steve Rogers befriends a more human-scaled soldier named Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) during his morning runs around the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall Sam tells him the answers to any questions he may have about the course of the 20th and 21st centuries can be found in Marvin Gayes ""Trouble Man"" soundtrack. Which is kind of brilliant and true. (Steve seems to be up to speed on the fact that soldiers who look like Sam can be officers now and arent confined to segregated units.)So yeah theres stuff to enjoy Evans and Mackie have a relaxed chemistry Samuel L. Jackson gets a brief turn as Nick Fury the garrulous and pragmatic director of SHIELD and Scarlett Johansson more or less operating on cat-suit autopilot is back as former Soviet seductress-assassin Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow. (This is only Johanssons second least-human character of this week after Jonathan Glazers sci-fi nightmare ""Under the Skin."") I suppose the writers are pushing Black Widow and Captain America toward each other at a glacial pace but I kind of like the shtick about her constantly trying to set him up with more appropriate women ""That nurse who lives across the hall from you - she seems nice"" This movie also features a tastefully oily supporting turn from Robert Redford as a senior U.S. official and old friend of Nick Furys who turns out to be pursuing his own agenda. Redford never needs to seem excited to deliver a combination of menace and power; its like a nifty little seminar in movie acting. (As Al Pacino supposedly told Jesse Eisenberg ""Just because they say Action doesnt mean you have to do anything."") You Might Also Like So Cap and Black Widow are sent to the southern Indian Ocean - uncomfortably close to the presumed site of the missing Malaysian plane as it happens - to recover a hijacked SHIELD espionage vessel from pirates. That mission doesnt go entirely as planned and Nick Fury is badly injured by fake cops after a Washington street battle involving a mysterious masked figure - yes its the Soviet answer to Captain America a human weapon known as the Winter Soldier. With that the whole SHIELD edifice begins to fall apart. Longtime comics readers will recognize this episode as a universe-shifter one in which the underlying presumptions behind a narrative franchise come unglued Who are the good guys anyway? Is SHIELD any better than its post-Nazi doppelganger HYDRA? Is Nick Fury or Redfords character a double agent and if so for whom? Who is to benefit from the fleet of low-flying armored hovercraft-spaceship thingies SHIELD is about to put into the air to survey the whole world 24/7 Panopticon style?Of course this is also the plot of a dozen or more thrillers of the past few years (especially the Jason Bourne franchise) in which rogue elements have undermined U.S. intelligence and it takes one honest man to kick ass take names and set it all to rights. Theres nothing fundamentally anti-authoritarian about this kind of movie which is just cashing in on generalized mistrust of government and defaulting to a nostalgic John Wayne ethos of individual heroism. Institutions are inherently corruptible so we need a strong leader in this case one who is 95 years old and imbued with the values of a bygone generation. Whatever you make of that message it has nothing to do with supporting democracy or opposing fascism. This movie will evidently be a big success which suggests we have reached a tipping point where neither critics nor audiences nor anyone else can tell action choreography that has some sense of physical space and a coherent visual aesthetic from stuff thats just a whole lot of super-fast cutting and digital clutter. If ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" is far from the worst offender in this regard the Russos display no particular affinity for fight scenes which zoom past in a high-energy blur thats meant to be exciting but struck me as entirely generic and forgettable. We can thank Michael Bay for this one I think Amphetamine-fueled editing where we get four or five or six shots a second coupled with elaborate green-screen digital fakery is what ""good"" or at least popular spectacle cinema is now.To say that this revved-up action aesthetic is monumentally boring and not actually fun or to observe that a movie that purports to convey a political message reveals its true nature as a corporate assembly-line product in those moments is to be a Trotskyite troglodyte killjoy halfway between embarrassing and flat-out wrong. We all understand that the overstimulated visual fizz of this kind of movie is meant to signal pleasure and so I guess it does. We also understand that a movie about a dude in red-white-and-blue stretch pajamas who flings his shield at people is not a political allegory about the real world or at least not in a good way. It needs to seem cool enough that we want to watch it despite its obvious silliness and viewed through that prism of canny analysis the craftsmanship of ""Winter Soldier"" is first rate.

Captain America The Winter Soldier is every rousing whup-ass thing you want in an escapist adventure. And did I detect a hint of depth under the dazzle? A little bit. So why kick a gift horse? More News Anthony Mackie Reveals Captain America Sequel Details All Stories >> To play catch-up in the Marvel Comics universe Captain America is really Steve Rogers a scrawny Brooklyn kid transformed into a supersoldier to fight the Nazis. In 2011s Captain America The First Avenger a more-than-decent period piece directed by Joe Johnston Chris Evans brought the character created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby to vivid surprisingly dimensional life. Steve ended the war cryogenically frozen waking up in the present for 2012s The Avengers a Joss Whedon blockbuster so loaded with antics from the Hulk Thor Iron Man and the like that we never learned how Steve felt after being defrosted. We do now. Its Steves disorientation after 70 years on ice that gets Captain America The Winter Soldier off to such an exhilarating comic start. Steve keeps a pop-culture to-do list including disco Thai food and Star Wars/Trek. His new buddy Army paratrooper Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) a.k.a. the Falcon says all Steve needs is the Marvin Gaye soundtrack from Trouble Man. Good advice. Steve gets another kind of lesson from Natasha Romanoff played by Scarlett Johansson with irresistible sass and sparkle. A former KGB agent known as the Black Widow for her fighting skills Natasha lays a smooch on Steve and asks ""Is that your first kiss since 1945?"" Steve thinks he did pretty well for a guy whos 99 years old. The directing brothers Joe and Anthony Russo with sitcom experience ranging from Arrested Development to Community know how to pace a film. And their jones for handheld cameras an irritant to some helps give a hotbutton spin to the script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely when it grapples with real political issues. Dont panic. No one is turning Captain America into an academic PBS thumb-sucker. But there is trouble at S.H.I.E.L.D. whose eye-patched chief Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson at his priceless snarling best) smells a rat on the inside. His instincts nearly get him killed during a car chase on the streets of D.C. The film hits an action peak as cop cars pummel Furys armored vehicle and he barks orders to the vehicles voice guidance system. Its the human brain and its computer equivalent working in tandem and the result is tremendously exciting. Kudos to Jackson. In his sixth go at the role he is still the quintessence of cool. Project Insight proves a formidable enemy. Its a top-secret program featuring drone-like helicarriers that not only spy on citizens but can ID and destroy hostiles before they become hostiles. The Donald Rumsfeld of the program is Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) a smoothie with secrets of his own. Redford is a blast and looks to be having one as well by sliming his heroic image. Slime looks damn good on him. It also sets up the battle. For Steve Project Insight is ""holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection."" Its up to Captain America Black Widow and the Falcon to bring down the baddies including the mysterious Winter Soldier a seemingly unkillable assassin. To avoid spoilers Im shutting down. Maybe youll get some answers in the latest film chapter in the saga of Captain America Avengers Age of Ultron due next year. Powered by a dynamite Evans and a first-rate cast this movie overcomes its plot holes and 3D too-muchness by making human frailty its primary focus. Talk about getting your priorities straight.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert You wouldnt think there was much more to do with movies set in the Marvel comics universe. Youd be wrong. ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" takes a flying leap off the basic premise of superhero movies and sails away in unexpected crowd-pleasing directions. The grippingly stylishly made film delivers mechanically perfect shocks and much more. This outing is an irresistible blend of Washington conspiracy thriller and exuberant adventure. Taking its tone from the paranoid political mysteries of the 1970s its a whirlwind of power struggles and deception twisty enough to keep audiences guessing. The film impregnates its settings with so much latent tension and unnerving evil that you expect the Washington Monument to start murdering everyone in sight. The theme is trust earned and lost. The U.S. spy agency SHIELD battles shadowy adversaries with an agenda for destruction. The organizations charismatic director Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) is about to launch a new defense system designed to pre-emptively eliminate threats. ""Thats not freedom. Thats fear"" says Chris Evans Steve Rogers/Captain America who has a healthy suspicion of the military-industrial-surveillance complex. After all the World War II supersoldier served under the similarly skeptical Gen. Eisenhower before going in a 60-year deep freeze. Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely craft a suspense plot thats generally logical and fill it with plausible strongly defined characters. Without becoming pretentious they make a serious point or two about the security-vs.-liberty debate. Marvel-Disney via AP Chris Evans left and Scarlett Johansson in a scene from ""Captain America The Winter Soldier."" As before Captain America is an old-school unambiguous hero an officer and a gentleman. Hes literally a museum piece in our morally compromised modern world of drone warfare and 24/7 data dredging. He visits the Smithsonian Institutions ""Captain America"" display lingering over images of long-lost Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan). Evans acts his grief and isolation with utter sincerity. When hes not in his lonely apartment hes in a daredevils rut. He leads rescue missions but cant relate to his SHIELD teammates. Its reached the point where Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) feeds him dating advice while they wallop villains in tandem. The film pits the duo against the mysterious and legendary mercenary the Winter Soldier who leads a horrendous assassination attempt against Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson at long last playing a key role in the story). Their tire-smoking asphalt-skiing chase through heavy traffic is a nonstop bacchanal of urgent destruction. Theres plenty of THWONKK -- the satisfying sound of Caps shield hammering an evildoers cranium. Theres also a sense the tentacles of SHIELDs nemesis HYDRA are sunk so deep in the system that nothing short of chemotherapy will offer a cure. Cap is fighting not just to foil terrorists but to defend his own values. Its the perfect film for these anxious times. Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo (of NBCs ""Community"") show a gift for ambitious large-scale filmmaking. They channel their expert comic timing into designing energized exciting action sequences. The film exists in a realistic world of practical stunts delivered with visual snap. No matter how brain-frazzling the fight theres a three-dimensional dynamic to the push-and-pull of the combat. Their compositions are far from the flat shallow images of comic-book panels. The directors dont skimp on attention to performance and characterization. Redford is superb as the ambiguous Pierce who could be his ""Three Days of the Condor"" CIA man 30 years on. Hes a savior one minute and a sardonic ruthless hard-ass the next his gaze asserting authority while implying just-pals equality. Anthony Mackie brings enormous presence and warmth to his role as Sam a veteran who can relate to Caps alienation. The Russos also salt in some cunning humor. Cap keeps a list of modern subjects he needs to research in pocket notebook -- hes an analog guy. On his tally is "" I Love Lucy Berlin Wall (up amp; down) Thai food and Nirvana (band)."" Smartly self-aware grandiose without being overblown ""The Winter Soldier"" is a crackerjack summer blockbuster three months early.

"Captain America The Winter Soldier Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW Captain America The Winter Soldier  Behind the Scenes of Captain America The Winter Soldier Before Captain America The Winter Solider the highly anticipated sequel to Marvels first superhero hits theaters on April 4th Rob Marciano is taking you to the set. Watch the video above for a special behind the scenes look at the film with Before Captain America The Winter Solider the highly anticipated sequel to Marvels first superhero hits theaters on April 4th Rob Marciano is taking you to the set. Watch the video above for a special behind the scenes look at the film with Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" is a better-than-average Marvel superhero bash intriguingly plotted and pretty clever in its speculations about 21st-century life for Steve Rogers aka Captain America the greatest of the Greatest Generation warriors as he contends with contemporary American geopolitical ideals run amok.The movie does its duty. Its a reliable commodity delivered efficiently and well like pizza. In its frenzied action style and overall visual approach the film is interestingly different from the first ""Captain America"" my favorite of the Marvel franchisees alongside the first ""Iron Man"" which has been carbon-dated to a time when Robert Downey Jr. seemed like novel casting. But Id be lying if I said I enjoyed ""Captain America"" 2 as much as I did ""Captain America"" the first. Many are praising the sequel for its harsh realism and frenetic approach to hand-to-hand combat both in the staging and the editing. The directors are siblings Anthony and Joe Russo who havent made a feature since ""You Me and Dupree"" eight years ago but who are about to become big deals in Hollywood thanks to the inevitable success of this thing. (Theyre already attached to a sequel.)The new ""Captain America"" copies the pummeling sales tactics of ""The Avengers"" which made a billion and a half dollars worldwide two years ago. May 2015 brings the sequel to that all-star variety show to be titled ""Avengers Age of Ultron."" Its beginning to feel as if the Age of Ultron which could be another name for Hollywoods Marvel-dominant era will never end. Long after life on Earth has been extinguished therell still be an ""Iron Man"" sequel coming out the following spring. This ""Captain America"" works for several reasons beginning with the script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. It pauses occasionally to remind us that these are supposed to be human beings however genetically enhanced coping with real-world problems of trust and job insecurity and battling trauma and fish-out-of-water loneliness.Chris Evans is back as Rogers who is now 95 years old but looks 30ish thanks to the deep-freeze process initiated by his S.H.I.E.L.D. overseers led by eye-patched and anger-fueled Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) whose temperament suggests hell someday be revealed to be the real Incredible Hulk. The first ""Captain America"" was set in and around World War II with Cappy and his boomerang-y shield fighting the sinister forces of Hydra. ""The Winter Soldier"" follows Cap into the present day alongside Scarlett Johanssons wily S.H.I.E.L.D. operative Black Widow. Their nemesis is the Soviet supersoldier known as the Winter Soldier who is in fact none other than ... a fellow named Spoiler Alert.Theres the tiniest hint of a romance though Black Widow is plainly too much for Rogers emotional circuitry to handle. The new day that Rogers/Cappy must negotiate is one of rampant escalating paranoia never much of an aphrodisiac. Robert Redford lightens the films load as the trusted respected well-tailored S.H.I.E.L.D. overseer whos mixed up in the World Security Council. Americas latest secret weapons hiding deep beneath the surface of Washington D.C. are a trio of flying battleships armed to the teeth and able to kill ""a thousand hostiles a minute"" Fury mentions to a skeptical Rogers. Soon our hero is hung out to dry by his own team and like a Redford character in a 70s thriller he doesnt know whom to believe.The shortlist of the trustworthy includes an Army paratrooper played by Anthony Mackie. With a pair of sleek metal wings he transforms into the Falcon. Mackies a real asset here and in general the cast is fully engaged with only trace elements of sequel-itis afflicting the tenor of the storytelling. They find ways to deliver the welcome wisecrack or the leavening zinger just so before the next round of slaughter begins. The worldwide success of these movies is in their superheroics of course and in the crazy degree of overkill involved. There is no ""just enough"" in todays computer-generated Marvel marvels; there is only ""too much."" And theres a stealth element of hypocrisy in a film like ""The Winter Soldier"" which bemoans Americas bloodthirsty weapons-mad impulses even as it exploits all the hardware and an obscene body count for fun and profit. Something about even a good Marvel movie is starting to feel a little bit enough-already. But in ""Captain America"" 2 at least our own skepticism and ambivalence regarding where its all going is mirrored by a protagonist who favors swing-era standards even if his buddy Falcon has the excellent taste to recommend he give Marvin Gayes ""Trouble Man"" a listen too.mjphillipstribune.com""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence gunplay and action throughout)Running time 216Opens Thursday night Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Action (Movie Genre) Captain America The Winter Soldier Anthony Mackie Iron Man (movie) Robert Redford Latest movie reviews REVIEW Finding Vivian Maier  1/2 REVIEW Anita  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising71deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-captain-america-winter-soldier-20140402,0,2670864.column",200,captainamericathewintersoldier25,captainamericathewintersoldier,chicagotribune

Steve Rogers the puny kid transformed by science into Captain America was in cold storage from the end of World War II through the day before yesterday -- in Marvel movie terms to his thawing out in the 2011 Captain America The First Avenger. Created in 1940 by writer Joe Simon and artist Jack Kirby Steve remains a sweet-souled anachronism with bionic biceps. He has yet to learn postmodern essentials like sarcasm cynicism and the art of the passionate kiss; people in the antique movies of his youth expressed romance with their mouths closed their tongues firmly in cheek. So in the new sequel Captain America The Winter Solider after Steve (Chris Evans) brushes lips with fellow Avenger and fabulous babe Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) alias Black Widow she asks ""Was that your first kiss since 1945?"" (READ Why Marvels Superhero Roundup The Avengers Was Very Nearly Super) ""Im 95"" Steve replies a smile concealing his hurt. ""Im not dead."" But having missed six or seven decades of American popular culture -- which is to say the only culture Americans know and revere -- he realizes he has some catching up to do. He finds the Internet useful and keeps a notebook of touchstones he missed disco Rocky Star Wars and the Marvin Gaye album Trouble Man. Note that all these items are from the 1970s back when Vietnam atrocities the Watergate scandal the Jonestown massacre and the spike in urban crime led many Americans to decide that paranoia was the purest form of realism. That notion -- of powerful or violent forces conspiring against civilians -- also primed some of the decades finest most haunting movies The Parallax View starring Warren Beatty and All the Presidents Men and Three Days of the Condor both with Robert Redford as a cocky crusader against government corruption. (READ The cover story on All the Presidents Men by subscribing to TIME) Beatty hasnt been in a movie since Town amp; Country in 2001 but Redford was available to lend his liberal gravitas to The Winter Soldier a sharp and pertinent political fable masquerading as a pre-summer blockbuster. Not that the film lacks Marvels mandatory fisticuffs car chases bus flips gigantic military hardware and a spectacular fight in an elevator -- Steve vs. a dozen thugs in a tight space -- or that the good Captain cant find a zillion cute uses for his only weapon a war-surplus shield (discus battering ram boomerang you name it). But this is a moodier more thoughtful Marvel movie and a big step up in ambition and achievement from The First Avenger. The Winter Soldier underlines its progressive tilt in the first scene as super-speedy Steve races past ex-Army officer Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) on a jogging course. ""On your left"" he shouts each time he laps Sam. On the political spectrum thats where youll find this movie written by Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely (the three Narnia movies plus the first Captain America and the second Thor) and directed by Joe and Anthony Russo (who helmed the films Welcome to Collinwood and You Me and Dupree as well as episodes of Arrested Development and Community). It imagines enemies within the very government that Steve has dewily trusted and fought to preserve. He accuses these suave miscreants of ""holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection."" To save his old idea of America he must go rogue -- a Hitchcockian hero on the run. (READ Corlisss review of the 2011 Captain America The First Avenger) Redford plays Alexander Pierce a State Department guru of such lofty repute that he once turned down a Nobel Prize. His latest passion is Project Insight a mysterious plan under the aegis of S.H.I.E.L.D. the counterterrorist organization for whom Marvels many Avengers serve as enforcers. Suspicious of the project S.H.I.E.L.D.s boss Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) asks for a brief delay before it is deployed and the Secretary agrees -- on the condition that Fury will send Iron Man to attend a Pierce family birthday. ""And not just a fly-by. Hes got to mingle."" Decent fellow nice sense of humor eh? Or is he a world-threatening madman? Viewers are primed to be suspicious if they follow two of The Winter Soldiers non-70s cult refs. One is to The X Files Fury in extremes paraphrases that para-noir shows mantra ""Trust No One"" by telling Steve ""Dont trust anyone."" The other is War Games Natasha in a bunker housing a huge computer of World War II vintage asks Steve ""Shall we play a game?"" -- whose answer in the 1984 film was ""Love to. How about Global Thermonuclear War?"" Preventive war which argued for wiping out another country in case its leaders were thinking of attacking you was a theory dear to old hard-line Communists and to Donald Rumsfeld in the George W. Bush White House. In The Winter Soldier that dictum blends with a New World Order. ""To build a really better world"" one of its architects argues ""sometimes means tearing the old one down."" (READ Our review of The X Files The Ultimate Collection) We have reason to figure that S.H.I.E.L.D. will survive the threats in this movie; it must keep functioning to stoke future chapters in the Avengers series and its various spinoffs. So what other Old World Order may be resurrected to worm its venality into the U.S. government? Perhaps HYDRA the ring of Nazi geniuses that was thought to be long defunct. It may have found refuge within the executive and legislative branches. The outfits founding fuhrer Dr. Arnim Zola (Toby Jones) may still exist as an all-powerful brain. And the Winter Soldier a super-assassin whose powers match or exceed Captain Americas may be the muscle behind HYDRAs genocidal mischief. So the title really should be Captain America vs. the Winter Soldier. As any reader of the comics knows they are frenemies of long standing. Indeed all the central characters -- who first appeared in the pages of Marvel (and its predecessor Timely Comics) from the 1940s through the 60s -- are very senior citizens. Steve is 95 more or less the same age as the Winter Soldier but Fury probably has a few years on both of them; he was a U.S. Army captain in WWII before being preserved by the Infinity Formula. Black Widow an infant during the Nazi siege of Stalingrad is in her early seventies as is Sam Wilson who in 1969 earned his wings as the Falcon Marvels first black hero. (SEE Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique in the trailer for X-Men Days of Future Past) Chronology is flexible in the Marvel universe. The main heroes and villains live forever usually surviving their announced deaths (as Captain America did in 2009) for the sake of endless intertwining story lines. Stan Lee the writer who joined Timely Comics in 1939 and dreamed up Spider-Man Iron Man the Incredible Hulk and the X-Men must have their indestructible genes. A vigorous 91 Lee has his usual cameo this time as a night watchman at the Smithsonian from which Captain Americas uniform has just disappeared. ""Oh man"" he says ""I am so fired."" Only Steve Rogers ages though he still looks great. His inborn innocence means he is vulnerable to disillusion; hes constantly learning that the America he was raised to love is a place of compromise and chicanery. In a 1970s story arc in the comics after Watergate he severed links with the government and retired his Captain America persona returning to public life only as a self-employed (and S.H.I.E.L.D.-faithful) symbol of the peoples goodness not the governments power. The Winter Soldier doesnt put Steve through such a crisis of conscience. He stays true to his logo -- and to Fury -- realizing that in a world where so many powerful men are evil the few good men must be powerful. (SEE The Twitter nerd-off between Marvel and Star Wars) The movie began shooting last April the same month that Edward Snowden started transmitting classified National Security Agency documents to journalists Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras. So the creepiest scene in The Winter Soldier must be serendipitous. In it the Project Insight overlords prepare to target millions of Americans -- not the old-fashioned way with a bomb that would wipe out a major city and everyone in it but with individual drone strikes each pinpointing some ""dangerous"" individual (as shown on a giant map) with anyone nearby becoming the inevitable collateral damage. Thats a lot of baggage for a comic-book superhero to carry but Steve and the movie still fly high through plot twists and cool stunts. Evans an actor who can be just as persuasive playing a serial killer (as Mr. Freezy in The Iceman) locates the discomfort of a misfit innocent. Mackie makes a strong debut as the Falcon who like Black Widow deserves his own Marvel movie. Johansson and Redford together on screen for the first time since 1998 when she was 15 and he was the Horse Whisperer enjoy a pointed prickly reunion. The film weaves in plot strands from other Marvel epics and during the end credits hints at developments in next summers The Avengers Age of Ultron. (SEE The first photos from Marvels The Avengers Age of Ultron) The Winter Soldier is no labored treatise on political science; it fulfills all the expectations of a Marvel movie. But this time the danger doesnt emanate from a fantasy villain like Neutron or an imaginary realm like Asgard. Its grounded in threats from todays headlines. (Russia shows up too though as a victim country -- not an invader.) Instead of butter on your movie-theater popcorn you get a healthy spritz of paranoia. It tastes good.

"Review Captain America The Winter Soldier sticks to Marvel formula - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Captain America The Winter Soldier sticks to Marvel formula Captain America The Winter Soldier Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Marvels latest movie Captain America The Winter Soldier starring Chris Evans Sebastian Stan Samuel L. Jackson Anthony Mackie and Scarlett Johansson. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Marvels latest movie Captain America The Winter Soldier starring Chris Evans Sebastian Stan Samuel L. Jackson Anthony Mackie and Scarlett Johansson. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Its a frightening disease one that can strike suddenly without a whisper of warning. Even worse there is no known cure. I know because Im a victim. Hello my name is Ken and Im suffering from Marvel fatigue.In fact this ailment defined by clinicians as a bone weariness at having the relentless Marvel Cinematic Universe (their phrase not mine) pound its formulaic product at you for film after film after film for what seems like forever struck me when it was least appropriate during a screening of ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" which by any rational measure is one of the better Marvel films. Briskly directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo starring the capable Chris Evans as the good Captain perhaps the most genuinely likable of all Marvels heroes now back in contemporary action after decades encased in ice ""Captain America"" also possesses an intriguing villain in the form of the aforesaid Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) a ghost warrior who moves like the wind.PHOTOS Captain America The Winter Soldier 75 images from the Marvel film When you add in a script by Christopher Marcus and Stephen McFeely that includes amusing self-referential lines (""If you want to say something snappy"" one character says ""this would be the time"") and actually references contemporary national security issues this is one film that should be engrossing. Except its not.For what is frustrating about this ""Captain America"" is that its saddled with the defects of its virtues. Its a product of the highest quality but at the end of the day thats what it is a machine-made assembly-line product whose strengths tend to feel like items checked off a master list rather than being the result of any kind of individual creative touch. ""Captain America"" is everything a big budget superhero film should be -- except inspired.Though that may seem like too tall an order for comic book movies its not. The ""Dark Knight"" films of Christopher Nolan are obvious examples of superhero epics that have that kind of creative touch. And if you stay within the Marvel Studios universe Joss Whedons ""The Avengers"" showcased the writer-directors gift for bringing mass-market stories to life with the energy and intelligence that should be popular entertainments birthright but rarely is.Though Kevin Feige Marvels head honcho makes a big deal of his willingness to be eclectic in his choice of directors (the Russo brothers are best known for the TV comedy series ""Arrested Development"") what that means in practice is that these films are such well-oiled machines it doesnt matter all that much who is in charge. Yes ""Winter Soldier"" features extensive use of handheld cameras and makes some half-hearted moves toward being a political thriller but at the end of the day these things barely move the dial on the Marvel formula. BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenThat cinematic blueprint is religiously enforced in everything from the required cameo by comic creator Stan Lee to the involvement of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to the requisite waves of action and surprise plot twists that dont feel that surprising anymore.Always included are trailers enmeshed with the end credits to gin up interest in the next Marvel venture. Each successive film has begun to feel more and more like a tease for the next one as much as a stand-alone item making the Marvel Cinematic Universe the most expensive Saturday matinee serial ever made. Except unlike the serials which had finite ends the Marvel films are threatening to go on forever.What does distinguish ""Winter Soldier"" as noted is its political overlay. Captain America being the square shooter that he is has trouble finding his footing in a contemporary world characterized by moral relativism. And when Nick Fury shows him the details of Project Insight a fleet of helicopter battleships that ""can neutralize threats before they happen"" Cap is not amused.""You hold a gun on everyone on Earth and call it protection"" he says. ""This isnt freedom this is fear."" Further discussions about the morality of preemptive strikes as well as humanitys potential willingness to sacrifice freedom for security are definitely not business as usual for films like this.Unfortunately much of the rest of ""Captain America The Winter Soldiers"" story of threats and countermeasures is by the book. Lots of name actors do their best including the returning Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and newcomers Robert Redford and Anthony Mackie but the spark of originality has left the building. What the rulers of the Marvel Cinematic Universe have done is discover and exploit a foolproof formula one that mints money even in these uncertain times and on one level when you think about superhero fiascoes like ""The Green Hornet"" its hard to begrudge them that.Yet it is also true that these films are getting increasingly dispiriting in their by-the-numbers sameness. Feige has said his team has new features planned out until the year 2021. Never mind the evil folks at HYDRA and their inevitably doomed plans to best the warriors of S.H.I.E.L.D. It is Marvel that really wants to control the world and the way things are going they have a good shot at it. kenneth.turanlatimes.com--------------------------------------Captain AmericaMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence gunplay and action throughoutRunning time 2 hours 16 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Reviews Captain America The Winter Soldier Arrested Development (tv program) The Green Hornet (movie) Chris Evans Captain America Captain America Winter Soldier inspired by Star Wars French Connection Chris Evans Scarlett Johansson tease Winter Soldier chemistry Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-captain-america-review20140403,0,1038013.story#axzz2xokj4jyu",200,captainamericathewintersoldier27,captainamericathewintersoldier,latimes

Share Tweet Of all the spandex-clad superheroes that have made their way out of the comics and into movie theaters these past few years Captain America may be the most hopelessly unfashionable. In 2014 theres just something archaic even bitterly ironic about a living symbol of American military might draped in the stars and stripes of a more innocent era. Joe Johnstons Captain America The First Avenger sidestepped concerns of anachronism by rewinding the clock to the characters WWII-era origins and placing him in the proper context of a beat-the-Nazis rah-rah propaganda adventure. But now that chemically enhanced fighter Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has defrosted on the other side of history hows a filmmaker to confront his dated squareness his 20th-century approach to a very 21st-century world? The obvious answer as provided by Captain America The Winter Soldier is to take that culture clash as a subject. In this spectacularly entertaining sequel Rogers is still running jumping and chucking his mighty shield like its 1945. But now hes doing so with the weariness and distrust of historical hindsight. Briefed on what the homeland was up to during his six decades on ice the Captain has become a disillusioned company man unafraid to question the government bigwigs handing him his marching orders. The Winter Soldier unfolds in a post-Watergate post-9/11 political climate one in which crimes are stopped before they happen someone is always listening and automated death comes from above. (Add the film to a growing list of tentpole fantasies--Oblivion Man Of Steel the Robocop remake--to take metaphoric potshots at drone warfare.) Yet directors Anthony and Joe Russo sitcom veterans making a fledgling foray into crime-fighter escapism arent operating in the uber-serious ""this is how we live"" mode of Christopher Nolan. Instead theyve mastered the multitasking required of any Marvel hire Their Winter Soldier delivers the requisite pyrotechnics brightly comic banter and future-sequel groundwork without breaking a sweat while still finding room to fold a throwback trust-no-one thriller into its design. Thats an Avengers-grade achievement. Rogers may still be acclimating to his new environment but the actor playing him has settled nicely into the iconic role. Evans in his third tour in the tights has located the boyish vulnerability of his character a man whose outdated earnestness and herculean aptitude have made him a kind of celebrity outcast. Reintroduced running circles around the Washington Monument where he meets a fellow veteran and future comrade (Anthony Mackie possibly cast for the Hurt Locker echoes his presence provides) Rogers is a fish out of water in the nations capital. (He keeps an adorable to-do list that includes Thai food and the Berlin Wall.) For a while The Winter Soldier simply grooves on the man-out-of-time malaise of its wavering patriot locating comedy in his inexperience with the ladies and surprising poignancy in his deathbed reunion with an old flame. But then an attempt is made on the life of S.H.I.E.L.D. honcho Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson); the culprit is a mysterious metal-armed assassin dubbed--you guessed it--the Winter Soldier. Soon Captain America is on the run from his own agency uncovering a vast conspiracy with the help of another Avenger the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson almost as good here as she is in Under The Skin also out this week). Hurdling through darkened office buildings down shadowy corridors of power and across narrow lanes of D.C. traffic Evans super soldier has clearly stumbled headlong into a kind of comic-book reinvention of the 1970s political thriller. The Russos transparent about their influences pepper Winter Soldier with knowing winks to The Odessa File and The Boys From Brazil--to say nothing of the appearance of Three Days Of The Condor star Robert Redford as a jaded politician. (Talk about a Tarantino-worthy casting coup.) Of course from the (parallax) view of today those Nixon-era mysteries look both prophetic and oddly quaint their paranoia a relic of an age when citizens still had to speculate about the dirty deeds their government was perpetrating. In that sense The Winter Soldier looks nearly as old-fashioned as its 40s-set predecessor--especially once the Russos start piling on the ""shocking"" revelations beginning with a monologuing villain whose beyond-the-grave exposition-dump blunts some of the impact of the movies critique. ""How do we know the good guys from the bad guys?"" Mackies suited-up sidekick eventually asks the Cap. ""If theyre shooting at you theyre bad"" Rogers replies the exchange underlining how black-and-white the films politics end up looking. That said even a lightly subversive edge is more than most mega-budget Hollywood releases manage. Ultimately The Winter Soldier is a Marvel movie for better and worse. As if by company mandate it builds to one of those massive endless demolition derbies and the plot was clearly crafted to accommodate larger seismic changes to the Avengers multiverse mythology. But if the Russo brothers have held up their end of the franchise-feeding contract theyve done so with above-and-beyond aplomb. Most of the action scenes including an early covert operation aboard a tanker and a messy brawl in a crowded elevator have been staged with a clarity uncommon to this studio. Whats more the Russos understand as Joss Whedon does that the Marvel universe is really just one big dysfunctional family--an extended ensemble of big personalities trading as many barbs as blows.  To that end the best scenes in their superlative blockbuster are the ones that rely on the rapport between Cap and his cohorts--especially Johanssons affable agent who steals a strategic smooch during one of the films most playful passages. Chemistry this marvelous never goes out of fashion.For thoughts on and a place to discuss the plot details we cant reveal in our review visit Captain America The Winter Soldiers Spoiler Space.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1135 a.m. MST April 2 2014Chris Evans returns as Captain America fighting not just for freedom but for civil liberties as the lines between good and bad become blurred. With Scarlett Johansson.""Captain America The Winter Soldier.""(Photo Marvel)Story HighlightsThe chemistry between Evans and Johansson helps the film succeed.The loss of civil liberties and rise of government spying provides a contemporary feel.The filmmakers take risks making changes in the Marvel universe.Captain America is typically the type of goody-two-shoes hero who makes Superman seem complicated and brooding.""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" manages to work around that limitation. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have made a film that not only delivers the goods on the action front as movies of this sort of movie must but is also about something. Namely the loss of civil liberties as the government proves more and more adept at eavesdropping on our secrets.Chris Evans reprises his role as Steve Rogers the former wimpy Army recruit transformed in World War II into a super soldier known as Captain America. As the movie begins he is sprinting around Washington D.C. literally running circles around Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) a combat veteran.STORY Captain America takes monumental Washington tripSTORY New Captain America a throwback to thrillers of oldSTORY Anthony Mackie soars as high-flying superhero FalconAfter his own film in 2011 and his stint with the Avengers Cap is having some trouble adjusting to the 21st century. (Like Iron Man in his last film outing Cap and his cohorts refer to the events depicted in ""The Avengers"" as simply ""New York."") His contemporaries are either dead or close to it and hes a little out of phase with the modern world.But soon Cap is called into action alongside Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). They need to rescue a ship thats been taken hostage. Dismayed to learn that Black Widow has a different mission from his Cap confronts his boss Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who reveals that theyre building three ""helicarrier"" ships that once launched need never land and have the ability to strike bad guys before they commit their crimes.This Cap warns is not freedom. And when Fury wants to delay the project going to his boss Alexander Pierce (the delightfully cast Robert Redford playing against his liberal image) for permission to do so things get deadly.There are far too many twists to reveal much more but by the time its done Sam will have become Falcon Cap and Black Widow will have kissed (theres more to it than that suggests) and Cap will square off against the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) whose identity is no secret to Marvel comic fans but wont be revealed here.And the lines between good and bad represented in the Marvel universe by SHIELD (good) and HYDRA (bad) will be blurred until they almost disappear.Its pretty bold stuff for a world grounded in well-established comic-book lore so kudos to the Russos and screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely for stepping outside the constraints of both the genre and the shared history. Things change here. It will be interesting to see how much of that change holds in ""The Avengers Age of Ultron"" due in 2015.But for now count ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" as another success in the Marvel line. Thanks to the chemistry between Evans and Johansson and a willingness to shake things up its more than just a placeholder between ""Avenger"" films.Directors Anthony and Joe Russo.Cast Chris Evans Samuel L. Jackson Scarlett Johansson.Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence gunplay and action throughout.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

And second so hed realize sooner that hes been plunged into one. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - One pleasure is how casually Evans treats his superstrength like a cheetah who takes it for granted he can run.Even among other furtive homeland security cabals S.H.I.E.L.D. the government agency at which the good Cap (Chris Evans) reservedly works doesnt have the best record of transparency or frankly homeland security. Under its watch the planets nearly been destroyed six times in four years including the one when it ordered an atomic strike on Manhattan. With that failing grade no wonder S.H.I.E.L.D. bigwig Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) is rushing the launch of three massive new mega-mega-mega-mega drones programmed to neutralize threats before they attack.Film DetailsCritics Pick Captain America The Winter Soldier RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time135 min. More Info Trailer But as anyone old enough remember our own War on Terror -- and clear Captain America The Winter Soldiers PG-13 restriction -- knows a government and its people have to agree on the definition of ""threat."" Especially Cap since hes literally the arm of the law. (And the abs and blue eyes but thats just a bonus.) Fury has warned him that the 21st centurys battle lines are no longer as obvious as WWIIs. Still Captain America is upset to discover that an early hostage-rescue operation in the Indian Ocean had a secret secondary agenda to be executed by inscrutable accentless ex-KGB agent Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and that Fury expects him to get with the program even if he doesnt know what that program is. Hes either with S.H.I.E.L.D. or against it and soon some members of S.H.I.E.L.D. decide theyre against him.Of all Caps superbuddies from his stint with the Avengers the leather-clad Black Widow is the oddest and best choice for his sequel pas de deux. She seduces him only half-successfully to join the modern age. If his conscience is clear hers is opaque. Although Marvel doesnt consider her an important or male enough character to earn a love interest herself she elbows Cap to find a date so often that he sputters ""Im 95 Im not dead"" And even if she never gets to have any sex the lens certainly makes love to her. As she pinches a ruffians neck between her thighs and flips him to the ground the camera jumps over her rolls beneath her then perches at ass level for a pulse-quickening view of Johansson strutting away.

Sep. 13 600pm First-time Marvel directors Joe and Anthony Russo hail from the far reaches of cult comedy (Arrested Development and Community and yes Danny Pudis Abed has a cameo) and operate as if their necks are still under a networks guillotine. The Winter Soldier has the taut nervousness of a story anxious to get in get the job done and get out. Its more grounded than other flicks in the Avengers franchise Theres no road trip to space no cackling galactic goon or cheap-looking space trinket with the power to destroy all life. The Russos add GPS coordinates to the bottom of the screen as if to say ""This is no comic book; drive to this part of New Jersey and see it for yourself.""They have no need for insecurity. The script is solid and the fight scenes are excellent. The Winter Soldier is the first Marvel film in forever that doesnt climax with our heroes mowing down a generic horde of non-human nobodies. This is bone on bone or really bone on that vibranium shield which thwangs satisfyingly as it ricochets around a room before conking a villain; Caps like a pool shark plunking the eight-ball. Even the laconic lethargic Fury has a fantastic car chase during which youre only slightly distracted by applauding Jackson for managing to negotiate an action scene where he doesnt have to stand.Only the charismatic Anthony Mackie as modern veteran Sam Wilson aka the Falcon gets shafted. This new guy has a few good moments with a gun a weapon the Captain would rather not wield but mostly gets stuck flying around in Gulf War-issue wings. In combat hes merely a small cluster of pixels flapping impotently in the corner of the screen. A few more films and maybe hell have a full-blown case of Tony Stark-itis the brittle insecurity of knowing youre just a man in a fancy suit.By contrast one of the constant pleasures of The Winter Soldier is how casually Evans treats his superstrength like a cheetah who takes it for granted he can run. As the moral center of the Marvel franchise hes more concerned with the responsibility that comes with those powers and so too is the film -- at least until the climax shifts our attention from his inner struggles to his outer badass.But before everything goes crash-bang-kaboom theres humility here too -- a perspective we dont always get from Thors godlike ego or Iron Mans man-made one -- in the moment where the Captain while racing to save the day glimpses a hologram of his younger pre-serum self. Scrawny Steve Rogers stares back agape. For the first time we truly feel the magic of his muscles the awesome and frightening authority of being Americas first and last uber-human hope. We see the flashlight-under-the-covers fantasies of four generations of comic book fans. And we understand their dream of becoming Captain America especially this Captain America who fights in for and against our world.CAPTAIN AMERICA THE WINTER SOLDIER | Directed by Joe and Anthony Russo | Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely | Walt Disney Studios | Citywide1 Captain America The Winter Soldier Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Directors Joe and Anthony Russo (208). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. Opens Thursday night. For a man out of time Captain Americas finger is on the pulse. The defrosted Marvel hero last seen in ""The Avengers"" is in the right place in ""Captain America The Winter Soldier."" His 2011 debut was set in World War II while this rousing terrific film is a product of our era full of dangerous drones and stolen digital intel. A great international thriller it engages the world at large yet stays focused as a sharp cast led by Scarlett Johansson Anthony Mackie and Robert Redford support the star-spangled main man. At heart ""Cap"" -- Capt. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) -- is still the ordinary patriot he was before a 1940s experiment gave him a body to match his spirit. Frozen in a plane crash fighting a Nazi offshoot called Hydra he strides through the 21st century jotting down the questions he encounters (like ""Star Wars""/""Trek?""). This Greatest Generation guy though cant square his new mission from S.H.I.E.L.D. boss Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). Steal info the U.S. security director (Redford) needs to stop evildoers before they do evil. Truth however becomes collateral damage. Chris Evans stars as the patriotic superhero in ""Marvels Captain America The Winter Soldier."" (Zade Rosenthal) Rogers and cohort Black Widow (Johansson) get worried just as Fury comes under attack. For help they turn to Iraq veteran Sam Wilson (Mackie) who dons high-tech retractable wings to become Falcon. The shadowy bad guys have another weapon -- an assassin called the Winter Soldier who like Rogers is superstrong a product of an earlier age -- and closer to Captain America than anyone knows. This masked mystery with a metal arm is used by old and new villains to ""maintain freedom"" -- yet as Cap says its a version of freedom that looks a lot like fear. Parents take note For all its heart this is a tougher more morally complex movie than its predecessors. Young kids carrying their miniversions of Caps famous shield may be in for a jolt. Adult moviegoers though will find a smart action-packed film with DNA that includes ""Three Days of the Condor"" and the Jason Bourne flicks. Directors Joe and Anthony Russo ground their very vulnerable heroes in a recognizable reality while never skimping on massive set pieces kinetic hand-to-hand fights and a secret lab ripped from the comics pages. That balances a final battle that feels a bit out of control as well as a multiheaded baddie conspiracy embedded in Marvel lore. Yet Evans is again a charismatic gallant guide as Johansson amps up the provocative playfulness. Redford adds a sense of cold war craftiness especially in an homage scene to ""The Manchurian Candidate."" And Mackie earns his wings as a cool addition to this world of avengers and defenders. (A salute to costume designer Judianna Makovsky for the balance between bold and believable.) Chris Evans faces a strong match in Winter Soldier. (Zade Rosenthal/Marvel ) Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson aka The Falcon in Captain America The Winter Soldier.

Rated PG-13 (superhero violence). At the E-Walk the 84th Street the Harlem USA others. ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" may be deeply mediocre and ultra-predictable -- but before you Marvel fans race to your keyboards to protest let me start with some things I liked. Theres a highly entertaining performance by a cast-against-type Robert Redford at its center and it gets some points by trying to spice up the oh-so-familiar Marvel formula with more hand-to-hand combat in between all the computer-generated battles. Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson are in good form as the defrosted super-soldier Captain America and the sexy Natasha/Black Widow who fails to thaw him romantically -- plus theres considerably more humor than in ""Marvels The Avengers (which I found pretty enervating). Scarlett Johansson stars as the Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff in ""Captain America The Winter Soldier.""Photo Zade Rosenthal/Marvel The idea of framing the story as a 70s political paranoia thriller is also worthy at least theoretically. Too bad the committee that assembled this project didnt seem to realize (or care) that this approach meshes awkwardly with the over-the-top action sequences Marvel/Disneys determination to avoid offending any potential audience members -- or the requirement to set up the next ""Avengers movie. Avoiding specifics is like writing a review with one hand tied behind my back so I need to venture into areas that Marvel die-hards might consider spoilers. All of which are telegraphed well in advance because despite all of their whining the fans of these movies dont really seem to like surprises (not to mention negative reviews). So stop reading now while I enter the critic protection program. Well before a mortally wounded Nick Fury tells the Cap to ""trust no one directors Anthony and Joe Russo use ominous camera angles in his first scene to clue us in that Redfords Alexander Pierce a senior leader within S.H.I.E.L.D. is in no way to be trusted. Chris Evans suits up as the iconic superhero in ""Captain America The Winter Soldier.""Photo Zade Rosenthal /Marvel So it comes as no real surprise that Pierce is the films chief villain who orders hits on Cap Natasha Nick and their new ally Falcon (an underused Anthony Mackie) to carry out his nefarious plan for world conquest -- which involves flying aircraft carriers loaded with missiles to take out millions of potential terrorists. Lest anyone think this is some vast right-wing conspiracy consider that Pierces buffoonish chief political ally is played by comedian Garry Shandling. And to further remove it from any possible contemporary relevance Pierce is working for the same group of ""rogue Nazis that the Cap tangled with in the 1940s (a distinction presumably aimed at not antagonizing the real-life descendants of mainstream Nazis). As the star of ""Three Days of the Condor and ""All the Presidents Men (who turned down the lead in 1977s ""Superman) could tell you genuine political conspirators back in the day didnt try to kill people in very public places and broad daylight with dozens of vehicles and the entire membership of the stunt persons union. The chief assassin is the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) of the title who comes off as a standard-issue movie psychopath despite an elaborate back story linking him to the Cap thats revealed late in the story (it will come as no surprise to anyone who saw the first and far more charming ""Captain America movie). New characters who will presumably have bigger roles in future ""Captain America and ""Avengers movies are introduced at regular intervals which tends to slow down a rather talky movie thats singularly lacking in any kind of suspense. Sebastian Stan plays the title ""Winter Solider"" in the flick.Photo Marvel The directors who have worked in TV since their most recent feature (the delightfully quirky ""Welcome to Colinwood) a dozen years ago shoot most of the interiors in close-up which doesnt do Redford any favors. And they havent found any new ways to stage the cliched scenes on their Marvel checklist -- like Cap fighting his way out of an elevator filled with killers -- that might make them memorable. ""Captain America The Winter Soldier does have its delightful throwaway moments -- a room full of huge 1970s computers presided over by the digitized ghost of a long-dead Nazi (Toby Jones) and the rueful look on Redfords face when his character realizes hes going to have to terminate a beloved employee with extreme prejudice. At 136 minutes it could have used a lot more of those moments. The funniest/saddest line in the movie was certainly unintended and has nothing to do with the plot Natasha says shes going to ""call in some favors from Kiev. Lotsa luck getting help from the besieged Ukraine now.

"Review Captain America The Winter Soldier is one of the best superhero movies -- ever - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Captain America The Winter Soldier is one of the best superhero movies -- everBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 03/31/2014 120000 PM PDTUpdated 04/02/2014 044947 PM PDT Related StoriesApr 2Captain America Chris Evans denies retirement rumorsMar 31Beyond Captain America The Winter Soldier Other comic-book movies heading to the theaters""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" ranks as one of the best superhero movies ever made.The superlative sequel to that 2011 old-fashioned charmer ""Captain America The First Avenger"" brings back a perfectly cast Chris Evans as the principled and now thawed-out World War II military hero and finds him clashing with modern views on conflict and peace.The result is an intelligent and gripping conspiracy thriller thats torn-from-the-headlines relevant. In the best comic-book tradition ""Winter Soldier"" delivers a topical message stressing the importance of freedom and cautioning us to not be so quick about handing it over when confronted with fear. Other high-minded ideals come up such as the complex boundaries of loyalty and the overriding need for more human integrity. All of it sticks. All of it works. The first in a stream of superhero films making their way to the cineplex this spring and summer its funny slick and absolutely enjoyable. Thats in part due to a cast that includes Scarlett Johansson Samuel L. Jackson Anthony Mackie and in a scene-stealing bit Robert Redford. But lets face it The superhero genre has been in a slump churning out increasingly minor indistinguishable offerings such as the dour ""Man of Steel"" and the rote ""Thor The Dark World."" By using special effects sparingly and concentrating on character development and a strong plot ""Captain America"" appears to save the genre from the clutches of mediocrity.Advertisement Directors and brothers Anthony and Joe Russo both Emmy-winning directors for ""Arrested Development"" make wise moves throughout avoiding the predictable and adding their own creative stamp. They mete out the CGI judiciously summoning it only when warranted such as in the spectacular climax that Industrial Light and Magic does so famously well. They also take a fresh approach to brawny old-school fight and car chase scenes by using hand-held cameras which gives them more punch and immediacy and makes the audience feel like its right in the thick of the action not lingering on the sidelines.The screenplay loosely adapts a ""Winter Soldier"" storyline created by one of the best comic book writers out there Ed Brubaker (who has a nifty cameo here as does Stan Lee). Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely shake things up at S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Marvel universe at large when one of its elite members is threatened. Meanwhile evil forces are conniving to move the world in a dangerous direction and characters from the past come back to haunt those living in the present. Were treading gingerly describing this narrative to avoid spoilers as there are many to be had. Opening in Washington D.C. the twisty plot manages to give its Marvel returning players -- Evans Johansson who plays Black Widow and Jackson as S.H.I.E.L.D.s enigmatic Nick Fury -- legitimate opportunities to throw around their acting might. Evans and Jackson sink their teeth into bristling confrontations creating a tangible tension that highlights these well-defined characters differences. The script also gives Evans and Johansson a chance to flirt and their chemistry is electric. Evans continues to impress in his role showing greater depth as his character confronts some ugly modern realities. His Steve Rogers is high-minded yet compassionate and those qualities are a natural for Evans. ""Marvels Captain America The Winter Soldier""..Winter Soldier/Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan)..Ph Film Frame..? 2014 Marvel. All Rights Reserved. Another plus Johansson is given more screen time than in ""The Avengers"" movie and she uses it with gusto bringing a fierceness to the part. The male-dominated superhero landscape is better with her in it. ""Winter Soldier"" also adds two new faces to this party Redford brings gravitas and acting heft to the role of high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. member Alexander Pierce while Mackie makes for the perfect wing man to Captain America. His Sam Wilson a war veteran is a welcome addition to the team. And in a smaller but essential part Sebastian Stan makes for an explosive Winter Soldier.Each of these characters has something meaty to do and thats why the films soars above other recent efforts. It advances the story and respects the mythos of its comic book creations yet isnt averse to taking risks and moving it into bolder directions. After all isnt that what being a real superhero is all about taking risks and watching them pay off?CAptain America The Winter Soldier    1/2Rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence gunplay and action throughout)Director Anthony and Joe RussoRunning time 2 hours 16 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

That continues in this involving sequel to 2011s WWII-set Captain America The First Avenger placing the character in an unusually shady political landscape. Were in present-day Washington D.C. a faintly utopian place where glass buildings gleam and Steve Rogers (Evans) can befriend former army supersoldier Sam (Anthony Mackie) during a pleasant morning jog. But its also the site of a massive military build-up three huge ""helicarriers"" are stored under the citys river ready to pry into peoples privacy a bit too impressively. Surveillance anxieties in a spandex-clad comic-book blockbuster? Just as youre savoring the hint of an ethically compromised eye-patched Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) along comes the films secret weapon Robert Redford plays against lefty type as an ominous high-ranking official thrilled by his new toys. Too quickly to generate proper suspense (yet causing plenty of giddy disbelief) The Winter Soldier nods to 70s classics Three Days of the Condor and The Parallax View. It results in a vertiginous turned-over epic where U.S. senators whisper allegiance to terrorist organization Hydra and good guys are on the run.The Marvel faithful will turn up for the action scenes and the directors brothers Anthony and Joe Russo add an uncommon sharpness to sequences of urban warfare--these Heat-grade bullet volleys have a real ping to them. But unlike the magically well-balanced The Avengers (2012) theres a touch of character bloat here The title actually alludes to a vicious steel-armed threat (Sebastian Stan) who never quite develops into a distinct opponent. Scarlett Johansson doesnt have a hard time commanding attention as Black Widow though youd think she would have earned a more complex role by now. Still this instalment delivers a heavy and welcome dose of paranoia administered between fleetly paced smackdowns.

Which is frankly the guys appeal. Because theres something inspiring about Captain Americas simple retro red-white-and-blue patriotism his courage his decency. In the modern age hes been thrust into his old-fashioned virtues seem fresh. The new ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" -- which opens April 3 --takes advantage of that. Not all of it -- the film could clearly find more fish-out-of-water angles to a big-band guy waking up in a hip-hop age. But instead it chooses to avoid the easy gags and go for stronger drama by having Cap confront something he really wasnt prepared for A S.H.I.E.L.D. that seems to have lost its way and may even have a few traitors buried deep inside it. The new picture has Captain America -- Steve Rogers if you know him from civilian life -- being called in to rescue some hostages. But suddenly it seems there was another secret purpose to the mission -- and there seems to be a shadow group within the government. Or as Nick Fury will tell him simply ""Dont trust anyone."" Chris Evans is back of course as Captain America but he mostly remains just a too-tight T-shirt; a few films in he still seems to confuse being noble with being dull. He (and the writers) need to realize squares have edges too. But hes great in the action scenes -- which is whats chiefly required of him -- and there are other actors to add the more dramatic touches. Like Samuel L. Jackson providing his dependably surly power as Fury (along with a fleeting ""Pulp Fiction"" reference). And Scarlett Johansson continuing her M.V.P. role as Black Widow the cat-suited former Soviet operative. There are also a few surprises -- such as Robert Redford making his first appearance in one of these superhero extravaganzas. He plays Furys old mentor and manages not only to find the truth of the character amidst the effects but to truly surprise. If the film has a flaw its that for all of Black Widows sexy teasing ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" has a harsher tone than other Marvel movies mostly because the villains are all using real weapons -- knives grenades automatics assault rifles. Going to a movie theater to watch a bad guy wield some super laser-ray cannon can be a cathartic escape from the real world. Going to a movie theater to see some psycho pull out a gun and start shooting up public spaces is more like a grim reminder. So do see the latest ""Captain America"" for its chase scenes (including a particularly spectacular one through D.C.) the saucy presence of Johansson a few quick jokes (is that a bottle of Paul Newman spaghetti sauce in Redfords fridge?) and new recruit Anthony Mackie who adds some high-flying action. And enjoy its rich detail of Marvel stories past and still-to-come with some fanboy references zipping right past me Im sure. (Sorry but Cobie Smulders Agent Maria Hill clearly didnt make the impression on me in ""Avengers"" she was supposed to.) But lets just hope the Captains next adventure brings even more comic-book wonders -- and fewer real-life reminders. Captain America The Winter Soldier (PG-13) Disney (138 min.) Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. With Chris Evans Scarlett Johansson Samuel L. Jackson Robert Redford.

TWITTER Chris Evans returns as the titular superhero in Marvels sequel. Captain America may not flex as much box-office muscle as his Marvel stablemates Iron Man and Thor but theres a steadfast band of fans who pledge allegiance to Captain America The First Avenger as possibly the best of all the Marvel superhero films -- other than The Avengers. These true-blue enthusiasts will not be disappointed in this second entry in the series which takes the bold (for Marvel) step of reducing CGI spectacle to a relative minimum in favor of reviving the pleasures of hard-driving old-school action surprising character development and intriguing suspense. If The First Avenger was a solid World War II action film with a Hydrated twist Captain America The Winter Soldier has one foot in superhero territory but the other in Washington D.C. Cold War spyland. The first series entry grossed 371 million worldwide and this one could well do more. PHOTOS Captain America The Winter Soldier World Premiere Invades Hollywood Notable for having induced Robert Redford to take a (significant) role in the sort of blockbuster franchise that he has studiously avoided throughout his illustrious career the film actually uses an important aspect of the veteran stars iconography as stylistic inspiration that being the ethos surrounding Sydney Pollacks 1975 Redford-starring espionage thriller Three Days of the Condor. And like its hero at least one of the storys villains also has his roots in a real historical conflict one of the factors that provides the cartoon-based characters with a bit more resonance and real-world weight than is the norm. When last seen in his own film in 2011 Captain America aka U.S. Army officer Steve Rogers had just dispatched the malignant Nazi offshoot Hydra only to then be frozen in ice. With his splendid physique looking none the worse some 70 years later Rogers (Chris Evans) has some amusing cultural adjustments to make but his natural instinct to remain an analog rather than digital kind of guy corresponds nicely with the appealing throwback nature of this outing. This is not to say that the film is devoid of major hardware. The big event on the boards for SHIELD is the imminent launch of three giant ""helicarrier"" gun ships that can stay aloft indefinitely and are so loaded with weapons that they promise to render all previous modes of warfare obsolete. Eying the progress from their new D.C. highrise offices are organization director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Redfords Alexander Pierce a SHIELD luminary who also heads the World Security Council. From the start screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely who wrote the first Captain America adventure as well as Pain amp; Gain and The Life and Death of Peter Sellers resourcefully shuffle the dramatic deck connecting important dots from before (the presumed demise of Hydra Rogers visiting his 1940s flame played by Hayley Atwell now a bedridden invalid) developing the enjoyable relationship between Rogers and Scarlett Johanssons Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow introducing doubts about the true allegiances of certain SHIELD officers and gradually building up to the full emergence of Captain Americas new nemesis the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan) whom Marvel fans know is the reincarnation of Rogers closest wartime buddy Bucky Barnes. VIDEO Captain America Trailer Remade with Children Featuring these and other opponents of sometimes-obscure identity is more than enough to keep Captain America The Winter Soldier brimming with vehicular chases surprise attacks shootouts fist fights Energy Baton takedowns miraculous rescues and surprising demises. The action is voluminous and when it involves machines its fine. However when humans go at it one on one directors Anthony and Joe Russo (Welcome to Collinwood on the big screen Arrested Development on TV) go nuts forsaking credible and exciting action within the frame for overcutting of such intensity that you cant tell whats going on. Its as if the filmmakers were obsessed with making Paul Greengrass look slow-footed. The intent may have been to create an impressionistic account of action rather than a lucid one but it winds up looking not only confusing but like a cheat as you cant believe anything real is happening; all you see is cuts not physical contact. Fortunately the story develops some genuine intrigue; as in the best such yarns its hard to know whos really pulling the strings and who other than the characters who wear costumes is sincere and who might be up to no good. For sheer plotting and audience involvement this is a notch above any of the other Avengers-feeding Marvel entries the one that feels most like a real movie rather than a production line of ooh-and-ahh moments for fanboys. After looking rather like the odd man out in The Avengers with his campy old costume and less-than-super powers compared to his cohorts Steve Rogers gets a new outfit and asserts himself as a likeable figure more than capable of carrying a huge enterprise like this on his muscular frame. A little self-deprecation can take you a long way with a character like this and Evans delivers it along with the wholesome and genuine sense of virtue thats at the core of this ever-youthful wartime hero. STORY Captain America The Winter Soldier Writers Talk Age of Ultron Superman-Batman Face-Off Evans and Johansson exhibit very good onscreen chemistry and their banter is charged with a fun flirtatiousness. Anthony Mackie flies aboard in the new sometimes-goofy role of a former paratrooper who upon donning a giant pair of wings becomes The Falcon able to swoop around dramatically when not struggling with the mechanics of his rig. Stans Winter Soldier outfitted with a devastating metal left arm proves a well-matched and equally good-looking antagonist for his old friend. But from a dramatic point of view the greatest interest lies with Jackson and Redford two great veterans whose presence lends weight to the fantastical proceedings and whose characters take some interesting twists and turns before its all over. Their roles are hardly demanding or multidimensional but both actors seems invested in what theyre doing and are fun to watch in this context. When it comes the spectacle is in a word large. For fans who might forget to stay to the very end of a Marvel film there are not one but two teasers embedded in the end credits one at the beginning and another at the conclusion.

Such details are kept to a minimum in this review but if you prefer not to know any stop reading now.) In one of the many Paddy Chayefsky-penned monologues in ""Network"" that still resonate today Peter Finchs newsman Howard Beale rails against one of televisions dramatic shortcomings ""Well tell you anything you want to hear; we lie like hell. Well tell you that Kojak always gets the killer or that nobody ever gets cancer at Archie Bunkers house and no matter how much trouble the hero is in dont worry just look at your watch; at the end of the hour hes going to win. Well tell you any s-t you want to hear."" This isnt always the case nowadays of course; groundbreaking series from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" to ""The Wire"" to ""Game of Thrones"" presented worlds in which even beloved characters could suddenly die without warning. And if a character from ""Mad Men"" threatens to decamp for another agency the show doesnt contrive to make him or her have a change of heart by the end of the episode. See video Captain America Winter Soldier - Watch Chris Evans Scarlett Johansson Kick Ass Still in any serialized drama the norm is to offer the threat of change or imbalance before quickly reverting to the status quo. Thats the kind of safety net that can creep into movie franchises as well. In the cinematic Disney-Marvel universe for instance SHIELD is always the good guy and HYDRA is always the villain and superheroes have a clear-cut moral agenda with no wiggle room for the complications of the real world. Until now that is. With ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" the corporations behind one of the most lucrative series in contemporary cinema dare to step outside of their safety zone not only tossing the building blocks of a film and television canon up in the air but also using a mainstream entertainment to ask provocative questions about our own government and about the compromises that we are willing to make in a technological world where privacy is rapidly disappearing around us. That screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (""Thor The Dark World"") working from a story by comic book writer Ed Brubaker and directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo could ask these kinds of questions in an ""Avengers"" film would be achievement enough but to bring them up in a Captain America movie feels downright subversive. Ultimately of course this sequel isnt a treatise about geopolitics as much as its a movie where a ripped guy throws a shield in peoples faces but it does all the things its supposed to do very well. If youre just here to watch Cap (Chris Evans) beat up a bunch of well-trained tough guys in a tiny elevator youll get that in spades but if you prefer superhero movies that allow themselves to run a gamut wider than A to B theres that as well. Also read Captain America 3 Facing Off Against Batman vs. Superman We find Captain America still adjusting to life in modern-day Washington D.C. after decades in suspended animation getting music recommendations from a new friend veteran Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and fending off matchmaking suggestions from the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). After Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) sends the Captain and the Widow to rescue a SHIELD ship that has been taken hostage and Cap discovers that the Black Widow has a side agenda involving data in the ships computers the shield-slinger gets angry with his boss about being kept in the dark. Fury and Cap have an argument early on about trusting people and while youre expecting that a movie like this would end with Fury learning he needs to open up and have faith in his fellow man its actually Captain America who discovers that not all things are as they seem and that even those who wear the colors of democracy and liberty might be in disguise. Furys boss in the state department Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford) is the films major new character so its not a big surprise when he winds up being the turncoat whos behind turning SHIELDs domestic surveillance program into a deadly bit of social engineering. And given Redfords past participation in classics like ""All the Presidents Men"" and ""The Three Days of the Condor"" who better to be part of a vast paranoia-inducing conspiracy within the U.S. government? With Fury being taken off the chessboard early on its up to Captain America Black Widow and Sam -- whom comics readers know as The Falcon brought to the screen in a thrilling way -- to uncover just whats going on and how to stop it. (Marvel fans will also get a kick out of the inclusion of characters like Jasper Sitwell and Batroc although their screen incarnations differ greatly from their four-color versions.) Along the way Cap will discover that while SHIELD and HYDRA might have different mission statements both groups desire for control over their perceived enemies and the muscle they employ to get what they want make them more similar than different. Also read Captain America 2 Sets Avengers Age of Ultron in Motion Bob Iger Says ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" -- the title refers to a deadly HYDRA assassin (played by Sebastian Stan) whose true identity is a secret even to himself -- bounds along excitingly keeping viewers guessing launching some successful switcheroos and bringing real stakes to the game. The end results of this film should reverberate throughout the big- and small-screen ""Avengers"" universe in a way that most franchise entries would never dare. The first ""Captain America"" had a lot of great ideas but its vacillation in tone and occasional failures to deliver the emotions for which it was clearly aiming made it one of the lesser recent Marvel movies. This time around however its a movie thats raising the bar on what we can expect from the ongoing adventures of these men and women in tights. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

The Rip Van Winkle of superheroes goes rogue in ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" an impressively equal sequel to 2011s superb origin story ""Captain America The First Avenger"" that trades the earlier films apple-pie Americana for the uneasy mood of a 1970s paranoia thriller -- a resonance underscored by the casting of ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""All the Presidents Men"" star Robert Redford in a prominent supporting role. Chockfull of the breathless cliffhangers dictated by the genre but equally rich in the quiet tender character moments that made the first film unique among recent Marvel fare ""The Winter Soldier"" marks a generally assured return to features for sibling helmers Anthony and Joe Russo (whove been in a moviemaking deep-freeze since 2006s ""You Me and Dupree"") and should easily keep the franchise gravy train powering through to ""Avengers Age of Ultron"" due next May. Notwithstanding the magical serum that first transformed 90-pound weakling Steve Rogers into his strapping spandexed alter ego -- and that pesky Tesseract that has caused so much trouble all over the Marvel universe -- both ""Captain America"" pics have stayed largely grounded in the real world and a sense of real-world politics. In ""The First Avenger"" that meant pitting Rogers against the band of power-mad uber-Nazis known as Hydra. Here it means bringing him face to face with an even more sinister foe the American military-industrial complex. Taking inspiration from such hot-button topics as drone warfare NSA spying and Wikileaks-style secret sharing the screenplay by returning writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is smart but never didactic about situating ""The Winter Soldier"" in a world where those on both sides of the political aisle have done much to compromise basic human freedoms in the name of defending them. SEE ALSO Captain America 3 Taking Shape at Marvel Gazing out over our nations capital with smug Rumsfeldian authority from a perch high in S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters Redfords Alexander Pierce is the very embodiment of the might-makes-right defense ethos succinctly summarized by the good Capt. Rogers as ""holding a gun to everyone on Earth and calling it protection."" And what guns Pierces top-secret Project Insight consists of three state-of-the-art drone-like ""helicarriers"" -- commissioned in the wake of the intergalactic battle royale that nearly leveled New York in ""The Avengers"" -- whose long-range weaponry can neutralize threats from a safe airborne remove. They can even were told analyze data from personal and public records to identify potential hostiles before they materialize. But hostile to whom exactly? The trouble begins when venerable S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) depicted as being an old friend of Pierces expresses concerns about Insights readiness to launch and asks for a delay. Pierce obliges but almost as quickly Fury finds himself on the wrong end of a hair-raising car chase through the streets of downtown D.C. that leaves him just shy of dead. Fury sits most of the rest of the movie out but not before instructing Rogers in the first rule of all conspiracy movies ""Dont trust anyone."" SEE ALSO Captain America Eyes 85 Million-Plus Opening at Box Office From there ""The Winter Soldier"" is off and running -- after all what paranoia thriller worth its salt doesnt involve a lot of running hairsbreadth escapes improvised disguises apparent allies who turn out to be foes and vice versa? Furys words to the contrary Rogers finds that he can trust at least two people the dangerous-limbed ex-KGB agent and Fury protege Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and former Army paratrooper Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) who like Rogers lost his wingman in the war zone. At seemingly every turn this intrepid trio find themselves assailed by the eponymous Winter Soldier a lethal assassin with a silvery robotic arm and a half-centurys worth of kills on his resume even if he doesnt look a day older than Rogers. Though the true identity of this masked man wont come as a surprise to even the most casual fans of Joe Simon and Jack Kirbys ""Captain America"" comics the film does a nice job of winking knowingly at the series faithful while keeping neophytes on the hook until the climactic reveal. Suffice to say that the past comes back to haunt in more ways than one in ""The Winter Soldier."" Where ""The Avengers"" couldnt seem to find time to ponder the disorientation the newly defrosted Rogers would surely feel upon re-entering the world this movie does particularly when Rogers tours his own elaborate Smithsonian exhibit and reunites with erstwhile lady love Peggy Carter (a touching Hayley Atwell). And in a sly running gag Rogers tries to catch himself up on 70 years of missed pop culture with choice shout-outs to Marvin Gayes ""Trouble Man"" album and that Reagan-era espionage classic ""WarGames."" Evans is once again very appealing in the lead -- perhaps even more so this time because the character has been given more dimensions. The aw-shucks ""kid from Brooklyn"" is now a man with his feet in today but his head still very much in yesterday and Evans excels at showing us the melancholy soul beneath the gleaming Pepsodent smile. Johansson similarly brings a real wistfulness to Natasha -- she too is dogged by her past only where Rogers is still living in his shed like nothing more than to forget hers. The biggest surprise however is Redford who has rarely taken supporting roles and who plays Pierce to oily perfection. He seems to be having a blast blasting ICBM-sized holes in his well-worn persona of the unimpeachable liberal crusader. Its to the credit of the Russos that they give the characters such room to breathe in a movie that easily might have been about rushing from one gargantuan setpiece to the next. Indeed the directors (who have spent the last dozen years honing their craft in episodic TV) dont seem entirely comfortable yet on the large-scale action canvas and their penchant for shooting action with a nervous handheld camera and fidgety hyperkinetic editing rhythms makes one pine for ""The First Avenger"" with its beautifully rendered comicbook framings. Theyre best at the small close-in stuff like a wonderful elevator melee in which Rogers lays waste to a dozen or so opponents between penthouse and lobby. But the movies extended climax in which the helicarriers move into position and threaten to wreak their vengeance often descends into a whiplash-inducing blur. Though ""The Winter Soldier"" lacks the special period luster of ""The First Avenger"" craft contributions are generally topnotch especially the sharp D.C. location shooting of d.p. Trent Opaloch (""District 9 ""Elysium"") and Henry Jackmans rousing propulsive score (incorporating bits of Alan Silvestris ""First Avenger"" fanfare). Sci-fi geeks of a certain age will get a special kick out of seeing ""Logans Run"" ingenue Jenny Agutter reprising her brief ""Avengers"" role as a member of the U.N.-ish ""World Security Council"" and busting out some highly impressive karate moves to boot.

BillUSA says April 10 2014 at 1234 am I dont usually read reviews before I see a movie but I couldnt resist. I thought this one would be panned until I saw the opening take of over 70 million. I am even more encouraged to see this installment now but I prefer films on my computer because the theater-going experience is much too loud for this 53 year olds comfort. On a broader note and despite some points that I didnt like about some of the films Ive mostly loved the Marvel Avengers movies of late. I remember reading comics of these heroes when I was a boy in the 1960s and to see them come to life on the screen with depth to the characters and the comfortable transition to contemporary times has the boy in me wishing he kept all those comic mags. I like the casting and the development of relationships (however limited) among the characters. Its done so well I even like Loki. Great job by all Reply danfrontier says April 1 2014 at 646 am How can Johanssons Black Widow be an ex-KGB agent when she was 7 years old when the Soviet Union dissolved? Reply odum says April 1 2014 at 1229 pm Heh. That is the question isnt it? And its definitely got an answer if the movies are keeping it close to the comics. Reply thomas says March 24 2014 at 900 am A part of me wants to see this film however I just cant get past feeling averse to the idea......its wrong that people are expected to work regularly. As long as its required on other people the people involved in the making of this film should be expected too to work regular jobs.

This article is the most critical that Ive heard of the direction. They seem to pine for the action of the first? We loved the first installment but its hard to say that the action was its strength. Shaky cams means they are feeling insecure? How about that is how most modern action films are made so they want Cap to contrast with his surroundings. It is cool that the movie is already inciting political debate. This should be fun to report and track. Reply johntshea says March 20 2014 at 155 pm Rumsfeldian? Not just cheaply partizan but rather behind the times. All the hot button topics you cite occurred under the present Democrat administration. Hopefully this movie can like its predecessor be enjoyed by ALL Americans and not just by one one side of the aisle. Reply sammyglick says March 20 2014 at 226 pm Please...Pres. Obama is STILL cleaning up the mess caused by Bush Cheney and Rumsfeld Those abuses you speak of started under the last administration. Now who is the partisan? Reply Bill Eidson (EidsonB) says March 21 2014 at 514 am If Barry had his way Cap would have a Hammer and Cycle on his chest.... johntshea says March 20 2014 at 433 pm I didnt use the word abuses and mostly repeated and critiqued Mr. Foundas own language. The last administration was that of President Obama. This is is his second term. After five years any mess belongs to him as Commander-in-Chief as do achievements like killing Osama Bin Laden. Overall I praise President Obama and Secretary Clinton for changing US foreign policy much less than I expected.
