Krampus wants you to believe in Santa - or else review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesKrampus wants you to believe in Santa - or else reviewHo-ho-horror movie Krampus is not entirely unwatchable despite amateurish direction frenzied lensing and bog-level CGI. Why couldnt it have been better?Emjay Anthony is young Max in Krampus about the anti-Santa.  (Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 4 2015KrampusStarring Toni Collette Adam Scott David Koechner Allison Tolman Conchata Ferrell Krista Stadler and Emjay Anthony. Directed by Michael Dougherty. At GTA theatres. 98 minutes. 14AHo-ho-horror movie Krampus is not entirely unwatchable despite amateurish direction frenzied lensing and bog-level CGI work.Hows that for a sleigh-bell-ringing endorsement? And I neglected to mention the cop-out ending. Article Continued BelowSo its not a shocker that Universal Pictures released this lump of seasonal coal directly into the wild Friday without benefit of prior critical scrutiny.What is surprising is how a potential Christmas giftie ended up on the remainders shelf. The story about a European folklore creature punishing children who lack Yuletide spirit actually has some juice. The anti-Santa is comin to townThe casting is good for a picture like this Adam Scott and Toni Collette as the affluent homeowners David Koechner and Allison Tolman as their trailer-trash relations pulled together for a dysfunctional family Christmas with their kids and other kinfolk both naughty and nice.Add in digital effects by Weta who worked on The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings trilogies and a soundtrack that includes Christmas chestnuts by Bing Crosby and Perry Como and Krampus looks as if it began with loftier ambitions possibly even franchise ones.So how did director Michael Dougherty (Trick r Treat) and his screenwriting committee get away with such hackwork? The story falls off the rails almost from the get-go as disillusioned young Max (Emjay Anthony) inadvertently summons the horned intruder Krampus and its evil disciples (think Gremlins ripoff).The screen explodes with a riot of invaders that look like circus clowns gingerbread men Travelocity gnomes Tim Burton grotesques and The Hobbit castoffs all decided to bring mayhem to one unlucky Midwestern American family. None of it is very scary despite the horror category.The fact we care at all about the outcome is a testament to the actors and only the actors. But buried beneath the Christmas clutter is a much better movie.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review Krampus kills it with Christmas scares that are all in good fun - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Krampus kills it with Christmas scares that are all in good fun Krampus Steve Unwin / Universal Pictures Emjay Anthony comes face to face with Krampus in the film ""Krampus."" Emjay Anthony comes face to face with Krampus in the film ""Krampus."" (Steve Unwin / Universal Pictures) Noel Murray At least four different movies are jostling for position in the holiday horror-comedy ""Krampus."" Half of them are pretty good.Writer-director Michael Dougherty -- best-known for the cult-favorite anthology ""Trick r Treat"" -- opens in the vein of ""Christmas Vacation"" nailing the stress of the season in a story that pits an upscale family against their redneck right-wing relatives. Adam Scott and Toni Collette play the effete rich couple; David Koechner and Allison Tolman are their gun-toting guests. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;The quality of the cast helps sell jokes that rely on broad stereotypes and even pushes ""Krampus"" toward genuine yuletide warmth and familial redemption ... at least until the monsters come out. See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link The title comes from a European legend about an ""anti-Santa"" who takes instead of gives. The beast here gets summoned by a little boy tired of his familys Christmas squabbling. The Krampus is attended by evil elves creepy snowmen and demonic toys which all attack the family in relentless waves.The horror scenes in ""Krampus"" are more assaultive than scary with fast-paced editing that is difficult to follow. But Doughertys effects team is top-notch and the movie takes unexpected chances with the style and the storytelling -- including a beautiful stop-motion interlude.This picture wont make anyone forget ""Gremlins"" (which is a clear influence) but it has enough personality and ambition that it could easily become an annual tradition for those who prefer ""Silent Night Deadly Night"" to ""Its a Wonderful Life.""----------------KrampusMPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of horror violence/terror language and some drug material.Running time 1 hour 38 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on December 05 2015 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""Scary holiday spirit - A gruesomely merry mix of monsters and family dysfunction keeps `Krampus entertaining. - MOVIE REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Movies Reviews Entertainment Toni Collette David Koechner Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-krampus-movie-review-20151205-story.html,200,krampus1,krampus,latimes

It was as if the movie was too mean too witty too original for them to handle so they gave up without even trying and sent the thing directly to video where it became an instant cult classic. Trick r Treat is beloved so its big news that Dougherty has finally made a new film the Christmas-themed fright flick Krampus. And wonder of wonders its being released to 2800 screens. For Dougherty that theater count must be sweet music.But Krampus sad to say is a disappointment. Its alternately funny and intense (dont take the wee ones) but never enough of either to form a cohesive whole. Krampus begins with a letter to Santa Claus written by Max (Emjay Anthony) who doesnt believe in flying reindeer anymore but does hope that sticking to the traditions of the season will have a restorative effect on his parents (Toni Collette and Adam Scott) who are drifting apart. When Maxs spoiled cousins ridicule him Max rips the letter to shreds and casts the pieces into the night air thereby summoning the mythological creature Krampus ""the shadow of Saint Nicholas"" who punishes those whove lost their holiday spirit.Film Details Krampus RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time98 min. More Info Trailer The next morning Max and his family wake to a power outage and a blizzard blanketing the neighborhood. The scariest thing in Krampus isnt the talon-fingered big guy or his minions -- which include demonically possessed stuffed animals and robot toys -- but the sight of the frozen suburban landscape (designed by Jules Cook) outside Maxs bedroom window. Its gorgeous -- and in its people-free stillness perfectly creepy.Inside the house Maxs uncle (David Koechner) battles gingerbread cookies come to life wielding nail guns and stealing scenes. The sequence is so memorably goofy that the gingerbread gang may end up with its own movie franchise. But if the kitchen is Gremlins-funny the attic is Insidious-grim as Maxs parents and his aunt (Allison Tolman) fight to save their children from a kid-eating demon clown and assorted haunted toys. Theres a lot of screaming and rolling around on the floor but as with much of the film Dougherty shoots the action so close up that its often hard to tell whats going on.Over time Krampus becomes a murky blur -- of action and intention. One of Maxs cousins gets sucked up the chimney which should scare the Santa out of young viewers. The movie sends mixed messages. Its hard but gooey too. Trick r Treat showed that Dougherty has a mean streak (with wit) but with Krampus hes clearly been charged with delivering a wide-appeal PG-13 film. In the home stretch you can feel Dougherty who wrote the script with Todd Casey and Zach Shields contorting his way toward a Christmas miracle. Its a painful thing to witness but in Hollywood creators do what they have to do. Horror fans meanwhile will be looking forward to the inevitable ""unrated"" directors cut.Krampus Directed by Michael Dougherty Universal Pictures Now playing Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Chuck Wilson Follow ChuckWilsonLA Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

The gentle consumer satire of Gremlins rubs up against family-as-madhouse slapstick of Christmas Vacation and Home Alone. Add the fairytale spookiness of Rare Exports and The Nightmare Before Christmas then undermine with the full-on seasonal sentiment of The Polar Express. The result a noisy mushy mess of a film occasionally diverting but generally forgettable. Its Christmas week and wide-eyed little innocent Max (Emjay Anthony) is finding it all too much his parents (Adam Scott and Toni Collette) are at each others throats his sister (Allison Tolman) is a typical eye-rolling teenager and his awful cousins are on their way. But when Max tears up his letter to Santa little does he know that this innocuous act will attract the attention of an older crueller Christmas spirit... Director Michael Doughertys 2007 portmanteau horror movie Trick r Treat has been building a reputation over the past few years and Krampus displays flashes of that films eerie intensity. The image of a suburban street lost in a howling snowstorm is particularly haunting. But elsewhere the film suffers from serious overkill too many obnoxious relatives too many evil critters crawling out of the woodwork and too many weak gags at the expense of fat kids and foul-mouthed old ladies. Trust us youd be better off staying at home with a roaring fire and a nice family favourite.

Is it a fantasy movie a horror or a comedy? It attempts all three but unfortunately misses in all of them. There are some parts where the demonic Christmas sprites appear and are truly malevolent but then thats spoiled when some possessed gingerbread men and a teddy bear with teeth make it onto the scene. Its a dark tale about family and being careful what you wish for on Christmas Eve and while it may invoke some memories of Gremlins or Pans Labyrinth youre better off just watching those classic instead.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 27 2016Keely HFeaturedWhat a odd film this is.

Adam Scott and Toni Collette star as a blandly upperclass Mom and Dad to a teen daughter and a son just old enough to still believe in Santa. Trouble arrives in threes Theres Moms sister (Fargo breakout Allison Tolman) and her uncouth family; theres the apocalyptic snowstorm that cuts off all communication to the outside world; and then theres the Krampus the mythic anti-Santa who punishes you for being naughty and nice. Krampus wants to be an irreverent horror-comedy but its too sentimental and too broad to hit the heights of Joe Dante at his best. And theres a weird undercurrent of classism in the movies architecture The suburban family is cutely perfect the country relatives are Cro-Magnon. If you love Adam Scott and David Koechner in anything -- I do and I dont respectively -- youll recognize their work as Harried Beta and Goofball Alpha. Far more entertaining are Collette and Tolman as the desperate moms trying to keep their families together. And full credit to director Michael Dougherty (Trick r Treat) because this is great-looking movie filled with freaky creature designs and a just-right mixture of practical effects and CGI.

""Krampus"" crud is coming to town. An odd horror-comedy hybrid the film stars St. Nicks evil twin a dark creature of German folklore whos sort of the anti-Santa. Tall hoofed and horned instead of visiting the nice kids on Christmas Eve he seeks out the naughty ones. And what hes got for them isnt a present. In this story hes summoned accidentally by Adam Scott and Toni Collette who seem to have forgotten the meaning of Christmas. Theyre hosting their inlaws for a three-day holiday feast but tempers are raw and fights are constant. So constant that their youngest rips up his letter to Santa and throws it away. Which apparently is enough to inspire old Krampus to pop by bringing a blizzard and a whole gang of evil toys. Unfortunately ""Krampus"" doesnt know how to mix seasonal comedy and holiday horror. We get some cheap gags about fat inlaws and nasty cousins; then Krampus arrives and suddenly its all straight scares about psycho elves. The two moods never combine. Nor once the horror starts is there much else to interest us. Scott and Collette both look like they have somewhere better else to be and they probably do. Of the younger cast many making their debuts the very best one can hope is that theyve already set up their college funds. There is one nice moment partway through when Scotts old German mother tells the Krampus story. The setting is post-war Europe; the flashback is done in charming monochromatic animation. You have to think how much better the movie would have been if everything had all been done in this setting in this style. But the scene finishes faster than a kid unwrapping his first gift and were right back to the not-very-fun present with the usual spookshow shocks of sudden noises and things that go jump in the night. A few of the monsters - particularly a giant jack-in-the-box clown - are nicely gruesome but theres no sense of real horror. Thats a shame because - as movies from ""Gremlins"" to ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" proved - theres something to be found in combining holiday trappings with monster-movie tropes. In fact the season has its own long spooky history - back in the Victorian age as nights grew darker earlier read-aloud ghost stories were a tradition. The best of them of course became the finest Christmas story of all time - ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens. We even glimpse it here as the grandmother is making cookies and the classic version with Alastair Sim is playing on the kitchen TV. And then someone comes into the room and switches it off so ""Krampus"" can continue. But then horror movies are all about people making dumb choices. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and substance abuse. Krampus (PG-13) Universal (98 min.) Directed by Michael Dougherty. With Adam Scott Toni Collette.

He sees you when youre sleeping. He knows when youre awake. Hes got horns hooves and an army of sinister elves and his name sounds like a bad case of abdominal bloat. He is Krampus the evil twisted ""shadow"" of Santa Claus and he has plenty of pain and destruction to rain down on one unlucky family thats lost the Christmas spirit in this divertingly spooky lump of cinematic coal. Directed by Michael Dougherty with the same eye for lovingly detailed genre re-creation that shaped his 2009 indie-horror anthology ""Trick r Treat"" (with 1984s ""Gremlins"" as the obvious touchstone here) ""Krampus"" isnt especially scary but it generates goodwill nonetheless for treating its home-invasion-for-the-holidays setup with an appreciably straight face. While Yuletide horror movies havent set the box office on fire in recent years (""Black Christmas"" anyone?) Universals Dec. 4 release should enable word-of-mouth interest to build a steady winter following en route to home-format haunts. Sensitive preteen Max (Emjay Anthony ""Chef"") is in for one lousy Christmas from the moment his aunt Linda (Allison Tolman) and oafish uncle Howard (David Koechner) turn up on his doorstep with their tubby young hellspawn in tow (played by Maverick Flack Queenie Samuel and Lolo Owen). Even worse theyve brought along their miserable old aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell ""Two and a Half Men"") who immediately starts complaining about the food and decor to the chagrin of Maxs already stressed-out parents Tom (Adam Scott) and Sarah (Toni Collette). Theres some easy comic stereotyping going on here Max and his family are a classy educated well-to-do and sympathetic bunch while their obnoxious relatives are crass slovenly violent and in love with football and guns. It doesnt take long for tensions to flare on all sides and send Max running to his room where convinced that Christmas is ruined he proceeds to rip up and throw away his handwritten letter to Santa. Big mistake. A freak blizzard immediately sets in over the neighborhood cutting off heat electricity and phone/Internet access. Vaguely menacing-looking snowmen pop up in the yard a delivery man turns up with some mysterious packages and when Maxs older sister Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen) decides to head over to visit her boyfriend she never returns. But panic doesnt really start to set in until Tom and Howard are mysteriously attacked outdoors by some freakish monstrosity that travels underground Bugs Bunny-style and tries to pull them under -- at which point it becomes clear that something has gone very very wrong indeed. Cue the requisite ironic rendition of ""Silent Night"" on the soundtrack as Max and his family huddle together in the living room with the fire blazing merrily away listening to weird crashes scampering noises and impish laughter on the roof and waiting for their predator to make himself known. It falls to Maxs wise old grandmother Omi (Austrian-born actress Krista Stadler stealing every scene) to explain that these terrible happenings are the work of Krampus a mythic malevolent creature who comes not to reward the nice but to curse punish and torture the naughty -- or rather those wee tots who have had their holiday joie de vivre choked out of them by the family from hell. Omi recalls her own childhood encounter with Krampus in a lovely eerie animated sequence that roots the films mythology in a history of pre-Christian German-speaking Alpine folklore. Its unlikely that the ancestors who passed down those stories ever dreamed that Krampus minions would one day take the form of miniature gingerbread men running amok with a nail gun or a hideous clown doll (shades of ""It"" or perhaps Joe Dantes ""The Hole"") who turns one of Maxs relatives into an early Christmas dinner. Theres nothing particularly interesting about the way Dougherty (who wrote the script with Todd Casey and Zach Shields) orchestrates the movies increasingly freakish and frenzied attacks in enclosed spaces and his visual approach in these moments -- shoving the camera in the actors faces while they do their best impression of Tippi Hedren in ""The Birds"" -- seems rudimentary at best. But shooting with d.p. Jules OLoughlin on a palette of gray snow-choked exteriors and dim firelit interiors he conjures a palpable mood of abandonment and isolation and of unseen terrors lying in wait forcing family members who could barely stand each other minutes ago to become unexpected allies. (The class condescension melts away in due course too Those guns sure do come in handy.) By the time the dread Krampus finally rears his horned red-cloaked head its clear Dougherty is treating his material with the utmost seriousness sans winking or campiness and with an atmosphere of grim relentlessness that seeps in like a winter chill. ""Krampus"" stays well within the relatively bloodless confines of PG-13 horror but its precisely the opposite of family-friendly. The faux-reassuring final scenes may have you misting up as readily as ""A Christmas Carol"" or even ""Home Alone"" but lets just say youd better watch out.

Movie Reviews Simbasible says April 18 2016 at 103 pm Krampus has its cliches but it is mostly such an authentic mix of Christmas and horror movie with great effects solid characters a nice flashback and a great message. Reply Kellye says January 4 2016 at 333 am Finally a critic who actually ""gets"" a movie. I saw it and was enormously entertained. Sometimes funny dark and spooky without outright fear but with a definite level of uneasiness. You think it will turn out alright and everyone will be safe because you dont actually see any corpses. You watch it and liken it to other Christmas movies where the protagonist learns a lesson and earns happiness. If you expect that here then you missed the point he come stop punish. When Krampus was called their fate was set. This is not a feel-good family holiday movie where everything comes out hunky dory. This movie should have done much better but it was up against the two biggest movies of the year Star wars and Mockingly 2 so it didnt have a chance. For those who did see it I hope they enjoyed the reality (vs false happiness) of other holiday tales and enjoyed the ""it doesnt turn out alright"" ending. Yes it is a B-movie but a B-movie that embraces and fully develops its status can be much better and longer remembered than an A movie that is only half-done. I hope Krampus becomes a cult classic like Gremlins Tremors Lake Placid Phantasm and many others. Movies should not take themselves too seriously they are after all meant to entertain and this one does it in spades. Reply Conrad Scroggins says December 4 2015 at 819 pm After seeing this movie I have to maintain that the Grandmothers tale of when she was a young girl was really set in the ruins of a town in Germany or Austria in the aftermath of the bombing during the Second World War. To me it looked like a childs perspective with a childs tendency to mythologize or see reality sometimes in supernatural terms. I say this because the Grandmas age puts her squarely into that particular time amp; place. The Krampus myth itself obviously predates her story but her story is self-referencing. As to the overall movie it was pretty much what I expected. What do you want from a C or B grade Xmas horror comedy ... or horrible comedy ... or comedic horror story ... oh hell whatever. Reply yosafbridge says December 5 2015 at 117 pm I figured she lived in East Germany during communism. Reply Kellye says January 4 2016 at 335 am More likely Poland not that it matters. Pajama Man (TGBED8v8) says December 4 2015 at 127 pm Oh this movie was amazing. Glad I saw it Thursday night before any the reviews were really out. Crazy good. Reply Kellye says January 4 2016 at 333 am Agreed Reply Bill B. says December 4 2015 at 934 am Sounds pretty bad but the trailer looked surprisingly promising.

TWITTER 12/4/2015 The Alpine legend of the evil anti-Santa Claus is brought to the big screen in this comic horror film starring Adam Scott and Toni Collette. Apparently believing that American children deserve to have just as many nightmares at Christmastime as European kinders director Michael Dougherty (Trick r Treat) has brought the Alpine legend of Krampus to the screen. A sort of anti-Santa Claus who punishes rather than rewards the cloven-hoofed horned creature and his evil minions deliver plenty of cinematic mayhem in this twisted holiday offering. Its only too bad that they couldnt find the time to meet the Coopers. The sole wide release opening the weekend after Thanksgiving a traditionally dead time Krampus will probably be confined to box-office leftovers. The pic begins promisingly with a cleverly ice-encrusted Universal logo and a terrific slow-motion sequence depicting frenzied shoppers pummeling each other in a big-box store as Bing Crosbys ""Its Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas"" plays on the soundtrack. Read More Comic-Con Krampus Brings Adam Scott Toni Collette The storyline starts out as a standard dysfunctional-family comedy as were introduced to workaholic husband Tom (Adam Scott); stressed-out mother Sarah (Toni Collette overqualified for this gig); teenage daughter Beth (Stefania LaVie Owen); and young son Max (Emjay Anthony) whose disillusionment with the holiday provides the impetus for Krampus to eventually make his appearance. The clan are soon joined for an extended visit by boorish Uncle Howard (David Koechner); his wife Linda (Allison Tolman); their tomboyish daughters (Lola Owen Queenie Samuel) and bratty son (Maverick Flack); and hard-drinking obnoxious Aunt Dorothy (Conchata Ferrell). Also on hand is Maxs Austrian grandmother Omi (Krista Stadler) whose stern worried demeanor is a harbinger of the terrors to come. A massive blizzard leaves the extended family stuck in their home without electricity. Grandma Omi advises ""Keep the fire hot"" while Beth braves the nasty weather to visit her boyfriend and fails to return. Beths disappearance is only the tip of the iceberg of woes. All hell breaks loose as the group is besieged by monstrous living versions of familiar holiday icons including gingerbread cookies snowmen teddy bears cherubs and a jack-in-the box. Demonic elves eventually make an appearance but the titular figure remains largely unseen until the conclusion. Read More Disney Uses the Force to Keep Star Wars Premiere Top-Secret Despite its PG-13 rating the pic is surprisingly intense with the filmmaker strongly emphasizing the horror elements. But while the violent sequences are very effectively staged the results are a strange hybrid that doesnt quite work. Lacking the antic witty humor of something like the similarly conceived Gremlins (1984) or the full-out gore of a traditional horror flick Krampus never really finds it niche. Still the movie has more than a few virtues. The visuals are outstanding with the wintry landscape convincing enough to make you shiver even in a well-heated theater. And although there is some use of CGI the majority of the effects are practical with many of the creatures superbly realized through puppetry costumes and makeup. Theyre genuinely creepy and the actors obvious physical exertions while interacting with them add to the tension level. Krampus is not exactly likely to become a feel-bad Christmas perennial. But its not a complete lump of cinematic coal either.

Photo Legendary Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Krampus Running time 98 min. Rated PG-13 (language scary images). ""Doorbusters"" is possibly the most odious term of the modern holiday season and this comic horror movie opens with a slo-mo shot of one of these sales Shoppers trample one another and fight over cheap toys set to a cheery carol. Seeing as ""Krampus"" is about the Alpine demon who punishes Christmas a-holes this is a promising start -- but alas its all downhill from there making a murky and humorless hash out of a pretty great piece of folklore. Max (Emjay Anthony) a boy on the cusp of not believing in St. Nick anymore is exasperated with his boorish visiting relatives (Allison Tolman David Koechner Conchata Ferrell) and his checked-out parents (Adam Scott Toni Collette) leading him to rip up his letter to Santa and fling it out the window where it summons Krampus -- ""Santas shadow"" -- to wreak havoc. A howling blizzard descends and director Michael Dougherty sets most of the haphazard action in either swirling snow or relentlessly blinking holiday light so good luck figuring out whats going on. Squinting I could make out a giant horned figure -- thatd be Krampus -- and his minions including goblinlike gingerbread cookies and a gang of nightmarish toys. Emjay Anthony.Photo Legendary Pictures More problematic is the human element This very capable cast has absolutely no wit to work with in a screenplay co-written by Dougherty. ""It looks like Martha Stewart threw up in here"" Maxs boozy aunt (Ferrell) observes of the house decor -- and thats about as funny as it gets. Meanwhile Tolman and Koechner play parents of kids who are supposedly amusing because A) the boy is chubby and B) the girls dont dress girly enough (the equally icky explanation not that theyre tomboys but that their dad wishes they were boys.) The moral of the story -- I guess? -- is be careful not to resent your irritating relatives during the holidays or else. Its a tall order Thats an American tradition right up there with prepackaged eggnog mall Santas and doorbustin.
