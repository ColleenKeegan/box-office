But The Five-Year Engagement lacks the freshness and spontaneity of both its puppetry predecessor and Segel and Stollers debut Forgetting Sarah Marshall this is a watchable but rather drab romcom which relies too often on Apatow-school cliche. Segel is Tom a hardworking San Francisco chef whose romance with Violet (Emily Blunt) is hitting its peak theyre ready to tie the knot. But when Violet lands a research position at a university in frozen Michigan the pair decide to delay. And delay... As this is an Apatow production we expect The Five-Year Engagement to be overlong overcrowded (there are endless supporting characters) and a little self-satisfied. But we also expect it to be funny smart and insightful. The jokes - most of them delivered by Toms tiresomely inappropriate best buddy Alex (Chris Pratt) - simply arent very good; while the comic set pieces - such as a scene where Violet and her sister (Alison Brie) speak entirely in Sesame Street voices - feel contrived. A soundtrack consisting entirely of Van Morrison songs is welcome when its The Man himself singing them but a reliance on twee cover versions saps the spirit. Most disappointingly the script is heavily weighted in favour of its male characters - were expected to sympathise with Tom even though he behaves despicably while Violet is depicted as the one in need of forgiveness a tendency that reaches its peak in the frustratingly overextended finale.

Though hes tall and muscular he has soft and saggy flesh that invites derision. The scintillating psychologically reverberant result is his bent for mortification a cinematic self-scourging through exposure--facing embarrassment through em-bare-assment. His onscreen notion of love (romantic love and by extension the love of viewers) entails pain and punishment; he becomes the joke of his own butt. The submissive side of male romance has always been a part of Judd Apatows moral universe and Segel who has risen to stardom in its compass takes that idea to a poignantly personal extreme with his performance in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" which he wrote and now in ""The Five-Year Engagement"" which opens today and which he co-wrote with the director Nicholas Stoller. The subject of the film is couplehood compromise and power. The films very definition of love is what you can bear to be with someone; and its vision of equality in a relationship is a succession of imbalances that ultimately even out. Its got a Hawksian symbolic castration like the one in ""The Big Sky"" (one of the great Westerns not on DVD) a slapstick-style smearing that brings to mind I dont even want to say (but you get the idea) and surprising gender ambiguities and reversals. Its also got a fascinating day/night dynamic (the man is a chef and the woman is a student--he works nights she doesnt) that calls to mind another tension between entertainment people and office people (and the movie makes some surprising suggestions regarding how to resolve it). Its also about secrets and lies--though Segel offers a sort of prefeminist garlicky wisdom in the vein of Apatows regarding the mysterious and irrational bond of spontaneous intimacy that a lasting love is based on. And he doubles it with a modern equitable ethic of honesty and psychological rational reconciliation. Which is a long way of saying briefly that ""The Five-Year Engagement"" is an exemplary modern romantic comedy personal and symbolic goofy and substantial tightly imagined yet loosely strung wise in bewilderment. It opens today and it really should be seen (whats more Segels chemistry with Emily Blunt has the ring of a pure metal). Then theres Richard Linklaters ""Bernie"" which I wrote about here yesterday and where the wrinkled skin of Shirley MacLaine and the attention to dead flesh of the title character a funeral director give the action and the story (two different things) a resonant carnal substrate. Sunday night there is the third episode of ""Girls."" Last week left Hannah in the stirrups being tested for an S.T.D. and theres more to come. Makeup costume and hairstyles play a smart role in the show Lena Dunham suggests that young women (and it turns out not just women) are trying on personalities and world-roles as they change styles in a flash. The episode ends with a dance a short and free-form one a brief moment of ideal liberation and uninhibited communion. Compare to Whit Stillmans film ""Damsels in Distress"" which has near the end an organized and choreographed Fred Astaire-style walking tap dance and concludes with the successful launch of a students new ""dance craze""--a line dance with specified steps that are even listed and taught onscreen. It may be a pleasure for the dancers but no liberation for them; rather its one womans liberation--that of Violet (Greta Gerwig) the student who created and imposed it. The metaphor for the pleasure of creating an object of pop culture that catches on is clear the dance is in effect a movie or a show or a book or an album that everyone is talking about. Stillmans movie--which is still expanding to theatres nationwide--is brilliantly inventive and deeply personal; but his notion of prescribed communion makes me think at times that Im watching a movie by David Brooks. His characters are collections of traits--but their idiosyncrasies (the word literally means ""singular mixing-together"") are magnificent contrivances. They dont come from within the characters not because hes unable to imagine the inner life but because he repudiates it. He spurns psychology in favor of behavior (theres a great line of dialogue when Violet claims to be depressed and is told that to be clinically depressed means youve been to a clinic ""Have you been to a clinic?"") and considers selfhood to be amazingly malleable by force of will. By contrast Dunham believes in the life within and one of the joys of the series is that the characters quirky behavior comes off as no mere collection of screenwriters whims but as the bubbling-up of trial balloons from vast inchoate beings in search of their social image and self-reflection. In other words whether or not its an accurate portrayal of a milieu or a place its a true view of youth. The Robert Bresson series is ongoing at BAM Cinematek. Tomorrow his last film and one of his best ""LArgent"" (Money) from 1983--adapted from a story by Tolstoy. (It was released here on DVD but is now out-of-print. I wrote about it when it played at Film Forum in January.) It has the briskness airiness clarity and derisive fury of a last film; Bresson made it at the age of eighty-two and its one of the cinemas most glorious testaments.

By David Denby Jason Segel and Emily Blunt in a movie directed by Nicholas Stoller.   Credit Illustration by Andre Carrilho The director Nicholas Stoller one of the bright young men brought along by the producer-director Judd Apatow (who might as well be running his own studio) began by making the soft Hawaiian-aired romantic comedy ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008). He then moved to rougher terrain in ""Get Him to the Greek"" (2010) with its prickly music-video parodies and Russell Brand flaring his nostrils as its prancing stallion. Now Stoller has directed ""The Five-Year Engagement"" which comes close to offering a complete comic vision of life. Like most romantic comedies the movie sets up marriage as the goalpost but everything becomes an obstacle to the union of Tom Solomon (Jason Segel) and Violet Barnes (Emily Blunt) a thirtyish couple living in San Francisco. At a time when good jobs are scarce theyre a pair pursuing separate careers. But its not just work--or the lack of it--that mucks up their plans; so do family friends the allure of other lovers and the changes and accidents that can befall anyone. ""Engagement"" which Apatow produced and Stoller co-wrote with Segel is a kind of commonplace contemporary American epic--leisurely episodic but pungent densely populated consistently funny and in the Apatovian spirit foulmouthed yet tenderhearted. The couple are a talented Everyman and Everywoman seen with affection and sympathy. Jason Segel is six-four and handsome but with a tendency toward corpulence (jowls threaten to descend). His Tom a sous-chef working in a chic San Francisco restaurant is a friendly eager-to-please man but hes also anxious and irresolute with a strain of anger that bursts out when his back is to the wall. Segel who also starred in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" specializes in non-macho guys willing--a little too willing--to look bad or make fools of themselves. Theres something almost infantile about him. Like a giant roguish baby he seems to enjoy getting naked in front of the camera. In ""Engagement"" however infantilism becomes part of the story. Tom like many Apatovian men needs to pull himself together. As Toms girlfriend Violet who has a Ph.D. in psychology Blunt with her fine dark-blue eyes and plush mouth plays off her natural British incisiveness with occasional bouts of sweet wandering uncertainty. Violet is ambitious but she is decent and loving too so shes often in conflict. As the movie opens the two are driving to a party and Tom casually offers the tidbit that ""frogs can spontaneously switch sexes"" a remark that seems pointless only at first. Violet gets a job at the University of Michigan and Tom agrees to move to Ann Arbor with her but unable to find suitable employment in a restaurant he winds up working in a sandwich shop. Both of them initially make light of the situation. After a while though Tom begins to resent Violets success. He knows its a banal retrograde response but he cant help it. Miserable he tries to adapt to local male customs he grows a furry hunter-trapper beard (it looks like a fox died on his face); he wears hideous sweaters. Without his chefs knives he has no edge. For a while the movie is an uneasily amusing trip to the depths of male negation. Stoller grew up in Miami and Segel in Los Angeles and the sunshine may have prejudiced them against colder climes. Stoller makes the snow and the slush of a Michigan winter look like Siberia in a bad year. Defiantly the couple try rolling in the drifts as the Swedes do for erotic stimulation but Tom lands on a buried fire hydrant. Its that kind of place. Soon Violet is flirting with her flamboyant professor (Rhys Ifans who gives every scene a menacing fizz) and Tom disgusted fakes an orgasm when hes in bed with her (perhaps the most quickly detected male deception imaginable). The movie suggests that relationships work only when you help the other person to act selfishly. If you dont get that aid from your partner and youre forced to give up too much of your own happiness the deal is off. You cant fake it. Comedies about ordinary people have a tendency to fall into drabness relieved by desperation--for instance Tina Fey and Steve Carells recent mishap ""Date Night"" was so tepid that it required repeated shots of Mark Wahlbergs bare torso to keep the audience awake. Stoller and Segel can do routine scenes without squareness. They employ a consistent comic strategy Tom and Violet are three-dimensional characters while the people around them are each defined by a single offbeat trait. Its not so much a satirical view as a perception that most people are naturally obsessive--the hobbyhorse theory of humanity. Stoller and Segel tailored a lot of the small parts for specific actors and Stoller doesnt rush; he gives everyone a good moment and more. Lauren Weedman is irresistible as a top chef so butch and blunt that when she chops off her finger she has someone doggie-bag it and without ceasing to issue commands briskly leaves for the hospital. Brian Posehn plays an Ann Arbor pickle expert with a mountain-man look who speaks the wildest profanities in a monotone. ""Engagement"" adheres to the modern movie convention of extreme candor in which sooner or later characters blurt out whatever hostile thing they are thinking. Violets mother (Jacki Weaver) is a pain-in-the-neck Cassandra who again and again urges immediate marriage on the couple the older generation will die soon she insists. And shes not wrong. Sudden funerals become a tolling blackly humorous refrain. Its a seize-the-day movie even though the day is a long time coming. Like Apatows ""Funny People"" the film is an intentional hybrid half gag comedy half open-ended exploration of everything that can go wrong--and occasionally right--between two people whom nature if not society meant to be together. Many older people grew up loving movies yet they arent going to theatres in proportion to their numbers in the population. One expedient for coaxing the boomers to buy more tickets according to the Times is unbelievably to launch the revival of Bruce Willis Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone chesty gents who will lumber through their remaining years in hard-puffing action films. In Britain they do things differently. Their aging actors may not be as muscular but theyre sturdier less concerned about age--more willing to admit its existence and simply get on with it. In ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" the director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") exhibits a respect for characters in their sixties and seventies which may stem from a respect for the tenacity of the countrys actors. At first the plot seems lame a group of pensioners most of them without sufficient means to live comfortably in England are drawn to India by a Photoshopped brochure and end up in a ramshackle old hotel run by an ebullient young man (Dev Patel) who has no idea what hes doing. The voyagers include a widow (Judi Dench) who is lost without her partner; a much divorced flirt (Celia Imrie); a sourpuss in need of a hip operation (Maggie Smith); a grizzled Don Juan (Ronald Pickup); a distinguished gay former jurist (Tom Wilkinson); and a long-married couple who have settled into fixed roles as aggressor (Penelope Wilton) and exasperated victim (Bill Nighy). Patel from ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is bumptious and voluble and a little bit of his scampering around the hotel is more than enough. Youre relieved when the duffers command the stage. They turn an obvious idea into an emotional adventure guided by superb craftsmanship. Judi Dench is especially good; playing a vulnerable character for a change she allows her habitual toughness to give way to uncertainty fear and moments of gathering resolve and she delivers one of her most wide-ranging and moving performances. ""Marigold"" is I suppose the essence of high-middlebrow filmmaking. There are no violent surprises and little in the way of formal invention. Madden and the screenwriter Ol Parker working from a novel by Deborah Moggach divide the movie into subplots. The characters are not in an easy position--India (as opposed to say Portugal) presents a puzzle and a trial for people set in their ways. The hotel is in Jaipur with its palaces and abundant commerce and a constant tumult on the streets. The light the color the noise the crowds the variety the heat and dust dazzle and overwhelm. Madden and Parker avoid the usual jokes--old ladies undone by saag paneer and the like. The encounters with India are soulful and momentous; the individual stories merge and lead to a reshuffling of partners a sorting out of destinies. As the filmmakers tell it India is a test. Withdrawing from the lure and the demand of the place is tantamount to withdrawing from life. Face it however uncomfortably and you defy mortality.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Super 8 Joss Whedon joins forces with seven comic-book heroes in The Avengers. By David Edelstein Published ShareThis Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans in The Avengers.  (Photo Zade Rosenthal (c) 2011 Marvel) Apart from being supersmart Joss Whedon has the perfect credentials to write and direct a colossal commercial construct like Marvels The Avengers He plainly loves the opportunity to put these comic-book iconsIron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Captain America (Chris Evans) the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth)in one room and let them hang out spar (with words as well as hammers shields etc.) and weigh the merits of individualism versus teamwork. Reallydebate is as important to him as Hulk smash The movie would be all over the place if not for Whedons centrifugal seriousness. And it would be overbearingly pompous if not for his nifty ability to spoof his subjects without devaluing them. Like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and other Whedon wonders The Avengers is both campy and reverential. Comic-Con nerds will have multiple orgasms. I had a blast. I also as I watched thought Wow that must have cost a lot of money money money waves of money. There arent many shots without fancy CGI or mighty sets occupied by dreamy men and women with finely sculpted bottoms. Even if scenes of superheroes whooshing around Manhattan and battling an armada from the realm of Asgard look like video games you have to admire a hot-dog shot like the one in which the camera zigs and zags to catch every single Avenger in midair bashing and crashing and hammering for all theyre worth (plenty). The frames have the thrust of good comic-book illustrations without overdoing it and Whedon picks his moments to come at ya with 3-D Here and there a spear will tickle your nostril hairs. On the human front the stunt doublesespecially Scarlett Johanssons whose name is I swear Heidi Moneymakerare gratifyingly elastic. You might as well revel in this thing. Its like all-day room service at the Ritz. The villain introduced in Thor is called Loki and played by Tom Hiddleston whose name invokes dyslexiaI always type Tim Huddleston. By any name hes a magnificently theatrical presence. Hes after a tesseract that will open a portal to Asgard. The larger point is that he wants to free the world from freedom. He thinks that deep down humans long to follow orders reminding Captain Americatransformed from a puny dork to fight the Nazisof another mad Fascist. The Avengers have a hard time focusing on Loki though since they drive one another loco. We all like to play the game Who would win in a fight Dracula or Frankenstein? King Kong or Godzilla? Palin or Bachmann? Here you get shield versus hammer. Hammer versus iron suit. Shield versus Hulk. Nobody wins but a lot of trees windows and expensive-looking control panels lose. Samuel L. Jacksons S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury lectures his wayward charges like the worlds dullest headmaster. (Jackson brings nothing to the part.) For some reason Whedon has the obnoxious Tony Stark (Downey) work on Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) whos diligently practicing anger management to let out his inner Hulk as if their flying battleship is some kind of est seminar. Shambling attractively mussed Ruffalo ignores him and steals every scene. Whedon gives some sweet moments to Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson now part government liaison part fanboy. He gets especially moony around Evanss rather colorless Captain whose most expressive feature is his muscular torso. Multiple protagonists means that by the time youve had your fill of snotty Iron Man you get the wooden Captain and when youre bored with the Captain you get the Norse hottie. Or Johansson who comes into her own. Over the years Johanssons once-refreshing self-confidence has become an irritant (the vibe is now snobbish) but her Natasha RomanoffBlack Widow is a treat her deadpan prickling with rage and hurt. The Avengers is full of terrific comebacks (Captain We need a plan of attack. Iron Man I have a planattack) and Whedon never lets us forget that in the words of one bureaucrat the fate of the human race has been left to a handful of freaks. The problem is what now? Can we watch another Iron Man flick without thinking Why doesnt he get on the phone to Banner? Natasha is rested and ready. Thor is just a portal away. Were spoiled. Well always be thinking Show me the money A charming funny reactionary mating comedy from the Judd Apatow factory The Five-Year Engagement is about a rising San Francisco chef Tom (Jason Segel) who sets aside his career to relocate to a less-desirable city (Ann Arbor) when his fiancee Violet (Emily Blunt) gets into a prestigious academic programand feels his manhood slipping away. Thats what a fella can expect when he puts his woman first. 1 2 Next Share this story...

"The Five-Year Engagement offers love comedy and Jason Segel without pants |       NJ.com comments The Five-Year Engagement offers love comedy and Jason Segel without pants Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 27 2012 at 840 AM View/Post Comments Glen WilsonViolet (Emily Blunt) and Tom (Jason Segel) cant seem to get their timing right. The most important thing in comedy is timing. But its an important part of romance too. The new movie ""The Five-Year Engagement"" though combines both by making it a big part of its romantic comedy. The idea is that Tom (a big American lug of a sous chef) and Violet (an English-rose-turned-postdoctoral-student) are as made for each other as Mutt and Jeff. They just cant seem to set a date. And when she gets a huge out-of-state career opportunity -- and he puts his career on hold to be supportive and move out with her -- they get seriously emotionally crucially out of sync. ""The Five-Year Engagement"" was written by Segel and good friend Nicholas Stoller who also directed and the movies humor is a bit like Segels own persona -- good-natured but also sloppy and galumphing and unsure of itself. At times you really want the film to step up and make itself heard to let the audience know how funny it can be. Instead it hangs back. Its the wallflower at its own party. It is though often funny in an understated (if still raunchy) way. And its very nicely acted. Segel (despite his continued unfortunate eagerness to drop his pants) has a puppy-dog sweetness to him and Emily Blunt can be very droll with a line. The comedys at its best too -- as most are -- when it pushes its stars a bit outside their comfort zone. So goofy Segel gets a physical scene when he suddenly has to remember hes a big potentially intimidating guy and chase down a rival. The sophisticated Blunt has a heated argument with her sister all done in her best Cookie Monster voice. (Thats okay Sis is impersonating Elmo at the time.) The movie also bears the hallmark of other films from producer Judd Apatow in getting good people for even the smallest parts. So David Paymer is Segels dad; Rhys Ifans is Blunts mentor. And a whole crew of comics -- Molly Shannon Kevin Hart Mindy Kaling Brian Posehn and a superb Chris Parnell -- adds its own twists. To the films credit too its open to the awkward honest -- and not always flattering -- moments of real life. Tom and Violet love each other. But that doesnt mean they cant be awful to each other or react badly when called on it. Theyre a committed couple yes but the worst wounds always come in close combat. ""The Five-Year Engagement"" would be even truer if it showed us just what these two people see in each other. And it would be funnier if it dared to go for a few cant-believe-this shrieking hold-your-sides laughs instead of just some giggles and gasps. But its still a fun entertaining picture and another credit to Segels rising career as a writer and star. Now if hed just keep his pants on ...

From then on Nicholas Stollers weird endearingly messy The Five-Year Engagement embarks on an uncharted circular voyage. Its two wistful determined leads -- Emily Blunt as grad student Violet and Jason Segel as sous-chef Tom -- are caught in a Sisyphean premarital loop. That doesnt make the film sound very funny and honestly it isnt -- at least not in the same fall-on-your-face-laughing league as Forgetting Sarah Marshall or the rest of the Apatow Factory crop. But The Five-Year Engagement with a script co-written by Segel and Stoller feels poignant and real in a way few raunch comedies are. What drives the sadness is a universal familiar the act of sacrificing for someone you love and the long-term consequences of making those concessions. Violet gets accepted to a graduate psychology program at the University of Michigan so Tom turns down an offer to run his own San Francisco restaurant loading up the van and moving to Ann Arbor to become a deli boy and housesitter. And the wedding goes on hold -- where it will stay. A magnificent college town Ann Arbor carries with it the stigma of lengthy miserable winters. For Violet the appeal of academias lecture halls and grad-student bars gives their new home an Edenic glow. For Tom its a snowy exile from real life and one that offers no real shot at happiness. (Seems a bit unfair to the multitude of real-life chefs working comfortably on the towns Main Street.) Still the fact that The Five-Year Engagement even has a palpable setting is a kind of outlier for a film industry that normally doesnt care if its version of the Midwest contains palm trees. Stoller and Segel bless their hearts know how to maintain an acute sense of location; much of the fun of Sarah Marshall was seeing Segels lumpy lovesick Californian stumble his way through a Hawaii that never really wanted him there. Likewise here Ann Arbor takes on a great many snow-covered shapes for the couple most of them hostile roadblock wedge rival. But Tom and Violet are unquestionably there which makes all the difference in a film that hinges so much on place and the question of whether that place is the right one. Tom makes the best of the relocation by making unlikely friends like Tarquin (Brian Posehn) and trying to find work as a chef -- while in the meantime putting in time at Ann Arbors famed Zingermans Deli. Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Its a shame the movie fails to harness its cast as well as its setting. Surely an Apatow production could have found more to do with such a roster of funny people. Kevin Hart and Mindy Kaling are barely visible as fellow grad students and the gifted Blunt herself gets shortchanged in genuine comic opportunities; her lumbering fiance scoops up most of them. Blunt and the rest are fighting an uphill battle against the films itchy editing which cuts numerous sequences before they reach their full potential. (This cant be blamed on a lack of material Stoller and his crew reportedly had too much footage to work with even excising an entire filmed subplot about Tom opening his own restaurant.) Nor does the scripts ill-informed attempt to explain university psychology research -- ""If you eat this you must behave like this"" -- do its supposedly intelligent practitioners any favors. Yet we dont walk away thinking these things. What we think is how profoundly bittersweet it is to leave such a big promise unfulfilled for so long that the unfulfillment itself -- and the love that fuels it -- becomes part of your identity. When Eugene ONeill wrote about this in 1923 it was called Strange Interlude and it was dark existentialism. Its possible the couple at the heart of The Five-Year Engagement knows their grand experiment is doomed but that wont stop them from clinging to each other like castaways. ""I dont want you to go"" Tom tells Violet during a fight. ""I just need to be alone with you here."" And improbably we laugh.

( ) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Friday April 27 2012 800 AM Title The Five-Year Engagement Film Info With Jason Segel Emily Blunt. Romantic comedy about a couple facing continual hurdles. Director Nicholas Stoller (204). R Nudity sexuality language violence crude humor. At area theaters. The next time you despair over the conveyor belt that seems to dump an endless supply of forgettable fodder into your local cineplex its worth keeping Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller in mind. Their efforts may not be seamless but these two are unusually committed to creating some of the sharpest comedies coming out of Hollywood right now. ""The Five-Year Engagement"" which was written by both men and directed by Stoller lacks the go-for-broke zaniness of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" or ""Get Him to the Greek."" But it aims for something deeper. Theres a newfound maturity here -- even if it is buried under needlessly extended bodily humiliations (this seems as good a place as any to mention that Judd Apatow produced). Segel is also growing as an actor though he retains the goofy easygoing persona weve seen in most of his projects (including ""The Muppets"" which he and Stoller wrote as well). As San Francisco chef Tom Solomon hes an impossibly decent guy and its easy to see why the equally charming Violet (Emily Blunt) would fall in love with him. They get engaged on their first anniversary which some friends and family members (Jacki Weaver Alison Brie Chris Pratt) worry is too soon. But when Violet gets accepted into the University of Michigans psychology department (led by a smooth Rhys Ifans) their plans are put on hold. This change is easier on Violet than Tom who helplessly watches his career and identity slip away. If youre not too busy laughing at Toms efforts to ferment his own mead you might notice how comfortable Segel and Stoller have become in exploring contemporary relationships. While they relied on broader strokes in their earlier films these characters remain relatable in even the most preposterous scenarios. Blunt has never been more relaxed and she and Segel have a believably warm chemistry. Its also nice to find a romantic comedy with so much respect for both its leads there are no heroes or villains here just funny likable characters figuring out modern life together. The films biggest flaw -- and one familiar to Apatow fans -- is its painfully indulgent running time. We feel every minute of those five years and thats a shame. Tighter editing and a quicker pace would have made all the difference; too many scenes seem wholly unnecessary. But as Violet and Tom eventually discover nothing is ever perfect. Sometimes ""close enough"" is worth celebrating too. Magic Moment Tom and Violet both have the opportunity to propose and each does it adorably.

"Five Year Engagement The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; five-year-engagement-the ) Five Year Engagement The (United States 2012) April 27 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The team behind The Five Year Engagement - producer Judd Apatow director/co-writer Nicholas Stoller and co-writer/star Jason Segel - is the same group responsible for Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Despite that this movie feels less like the often raunchy sometimes hilarious 2008 romantic comedy and more like 2010s Blue Valentine. The Five Year Engagement is being deceptively marketed as a comedy in the Bridesmaids vein. What it is however is an uncomfortable look at the difficulties of balancing a career and a relationship and what can happen when they get out of whack. Its the downside of a romantic comedy - what we dont see after the end credits roll. Theres value in that of course and the movie makes some cogent points. The problem is one of tone. The Five Year Engagement despite its serious thesis tries desperately to be funny. Some of the comedic material provokes laughter and some doesnt but nearly all of it feels wrong. Its as if the jokes have been shoehorned into the movie because it was deemed too dramatic. Its a lot like the Apatow/Sandler misfire Funny People in that it never seems able to successfully integrate the comedy into the drama (or vice versa). Theres also a lot of extraneous material that would have been better off left on the cutting room floor. The Five Year Engagement is too long by at least 20 minutes. By the end five years seems to be a conservative estimate. The movie begins with a proposal. Chef Tom (Segel) and psychologist Violet (Emily Blunt) have been dating for a year when he decides to pop the question. A period of delirious joy follows. Things are going well at work for Tom who is in line for a promotion. Violet throws herself into planning the perfect wedding while waiting for a college professorial opening. Meanwhile Toms best friend Alex (Chris Pratt) and Violets sister Suzie (Alison Brie) embark upon a whirlwind romance that ends with a trip down the aisle after a failure to use birth control. Then Violets dream job offer arrives except its in Michigan not in the Bay Area. Tom agrees to turn down the promotion and re-locate to please Violet. But while shes happy and flourishing in their new locale he is not. He has trouble finding work and as time passes he becomes increasingly more listless. The longer the engagement is extended the more likely it seems that it will end in a break-up. Theres nothing half-hearted about The Five Year Engagement. It has something to say about what can happen to couples when one half of the pair sacrifices disproportionately. At one point Tom glibly comments that he would rather be the ""one resenting"" than the ""one being resented"" - words he ends up regretting. The Blue Valentine comparison is not as ludicrous as it might seem. Both movies are about how seemingly rock-solid relationships fall apart once beset by the pressures of everyday life. Certainly Blue Valentine is more grim (bordering on unwatchable) than The Five Year Engagement but this film is no two-hour joy ride. There are times when the level of discomfort is so acute that it becomes unpleasant to watch. And the awkward comedic interruptions do little to lighten matters. If anything they have the opposite effect. Jason Segel and Emily Blunt work well together. They have an easy unforced chemistry. We believe them as the characters and root for them to work through their troubles. Thats perhaps only to be expected since this is the third time they have worked as an on-screen couple (following the delightful The Muppets and the not-so-delightful Gullivers Travels both of which were co-written by Stoller). Segel once again gets naked for Stoller although on this occasion he shows only his backside. Rhys Ifans and Alison Brie provide effective supporting work as Violets boss at the university and her sister respectively. Ifans has a nice little bit of physical comedy and Brie imitates one of the Muppets Blunt hasnt met. Forewarned is forearmed. This is not an unqualified date movie home run. The humor is insufficiently buoyant to overcome a relentless sense of pessimism and although it would be unfair to call The Five Year Engagement a complete downer no one is going to coin this the ""feel good romantic comedy of the spring."" Apatows movies have frequently been referred to as ribald raunchy hilarity wrapped around a wonderfully sweet center. Here theres still some sweetness but it has been undercut by a bitter infusion and the hilarity generates fewer laughs than his best endeavors.

But Roeper implying that the scnaerio is fantastical and dopey ? is a little insensitive given that this actually happened to Kim and Krickitt Carpenter. To imply that Krickitt(Paige in the flim) returned to being a spoiled shallow daughter is dismissive of the fact that Kricketts unstable behavior was the result of her brain damage. The movie took great liberties with the real story which Roeper could have taken the time to clarify. Reply from Richard Roeper The movie has precious little resemblance to the story to which youre referring. I didnt imply ANYTHING about the real-life story. Im reviewing the MOVIE.

Take our movie trivia quiz Video Trailer The Five Year Engagement Monitor Movie Guide Given the fact that ""The Five Year Engagement"" is from the creative team - director and co-writer Nicholas Stoller costar and co-writer Jason Segel and producer Judd Apatow - that brought us ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" I was expecting something raunchier. Instead what we have here is a wistful somewhat overextended but occasionally sweet comedy about a couple that cant - in more ways than one - quite get it together.Tom (Segel) a sous-chef at an upscale San Francisco restaurant and Violet (Emily Blunt) a psychology grad student meet cute at a New Years Eve party -shes dressed as Lady Di he as a pink bunny - and rapidly become a twosome headed for the altar. But when she is offered an attractive two-year postdoc fellowship in Michigan they decide to make the move and hold off on the wedding. Tom essentially gives up his career for her although the film makes it seem as if the only good jobs for a top chef in Michigan are making deli sandwiches. (The swipes at Michigan in this film dont stop there - their Chamber of Commerce should sue.)Tom who spends his newfound time smoking venison and growing mutton chops comes across as so ""understanding"" that hes almost stunted so its something of a relief to us if not to Violet when he finally explodes. What keeps the film from seeming shrill is that Tom and Violet despite everything genuinely love each other and their careers dilemma is not played for easy laughs.

"The Five-Year Engagement (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Five-Year Engagement (R) Producer Judd Apatow (""Bridesmaids"" ""Knocked Up"") scores another hit with this sweet yet raunchy comedy about romantic procrastination. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald4/27/2012 Editor rating 3 Jason Segel is the most unlikely of romantic comedy heroes. Hes goofy lanky not unhandsome but not exactly traditional dreamboat material. As a performer he does not waste energy cultivating dignity. (Exhibit A the excruciating nude break-up scene in Forgetting Sarah Marshall; Exhibit B his doomed declaration of love to Linda Cardellini to the tune of Styxs Lady in Freaks and Geeks). Hes the perfect actor to star as a Muppets big brother. He is adept at physical and cerebral comedy and still somehow vulnerable and appealing enough to warrant leading man status. Hes a contradiction but he works. He also has a way with words. Segel co-wrote The Five-Year Engagement with director Nicholas Stoller; the pair worked together previously on The Muppets and the Segel-penned Forgetting Sarah Marshall and theyre a great team. Engagements sense of humor is along the same lines as it was in Sarah Marshall often crude but clever and only occasionally gross. Stoller also wrote and directed Get Him to the Greek so heres something else to be happy about Russell Brand doesnt make an appearance. The best aspect of The Five-Year Engagement about a couple (Segel and Emily Blunt) who keep postponing their wedding is that it manages to accomplish both crucial tasks of the rom com It makes you laugh and eagerly wish for a happy ending without any preachy soul-searching. As a bonus its got a Van Morrison-friendly soundtrack and the trailers havent revealed the best parts. Segel plays Tom a sous chef at a classy San Francisco restaurant where he works with his best friend Alex (Chris Pratt doing a variation of his likable numbskull from Parks and Recreation and damn near stealing the entire movie which is no easy feat). Tom loves Violet (Blunt whos also funny) so much that when she gets a job offer for a teaching position at the University of Michigan he happily offers to move across the country for her. Violet senses this decision could cause problems but knows the job presents the opportunity of a lifetime. So they head off for snowy Ann Arbor where their relationship immediately begins to fall apart. Her career as a psychology professor blossoms under the tutelage of a fabulously hip attractive professor (Rhys Ifans; yes I know that sounds odd) and interesting colleagues (Mindy Kaling Kevin Hart and Randall Park) while Tom ends up making sandwiches with weirdos in a funky but hardly swank deli. Like other comedies that involve Judd Apatow in some way (he co-produced here) The Five-Year Engagement feels a bit long; it probably doesnt need all of its two-hour-plus running time and could have been pared down easily enough. And yet the payoff feels all the sweeter for all troubles Tom and Violet have been through. ""Sweet"" is a strange word to apply to a movie in which someone mimes masturbation with a carrot and yet its appropriate. Once again happily contradictions work.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 27 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Apr. 26 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Producer Judd Apatow has had hit movies about weddings ( Bridesmaids) and delayed gratification ( The 40-Year-Old Virgin) which should make The Five-Year Engagement - which reunites the producer with Forgetting Sarah Marshalls director Nicholas Stoller and writer-star Jason Segel - a consummation to be desired. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new comedy ""The Five-Year Engagement"" starring Emily Blunt and Jason Segel Movies The Five-Year Engagement The official trailer But though its occasionally funny and poignant this latest shambling quasi-relationship comedy from the House of Apatow feels more like the raw feed than the final edit and seems to run as long as the time span promised in the title. Segel plays Tom a sous chef at a San Francisco restaurant with Emily Blunt as Violet a psychology grad student looking for a doctoral program. We meet them on the anniversary of their first meeting at a costume party - he in a bunny costume she as Princess Diana. On their way to a party at Violets sisters house Tom appears to be having a panic attack. He almost screws up his carefully planned romantic proposal to her but soon the romantic proposal is proffered and accepted. Then the postponements begin. Violets sister Suzie (Alison Brie) steals the limelight by getting knocked up at the engagement party by Toms dim-but-confident buddy Alex ( Parks and Recreations Chris Pratt). Next they agree to postpone the wedding after Violet gets accepted at a two-year graduate program in Michigan. Tom agrees to go with her sure that his big-city cooking skills will land him a chefs job. Instead he ends up making sandwiches at a deli run by a pickling enthusiast and verbally-incontinent boss (Brian Posehn of The Sarah Silverman Program). Violet in contrast finds herself a valued part of a team of cute multiethnic male and female geeks engaged in wacky experiments under the guidance of a charismatic Welsh professor (Rhys Ifans). Since Tom and Violet cohabit and socialize as a couple marriage here is more of a question of inertia than impediments. (The last time an engagement ran this long in a movie was Jean-Pierre Jeunets A Very Long Engagement - and they had the Great War as an excuse). The rumply Segel and vivacious Blunt make for an appealing beauty-and-the-beast kind of mismatched pair - he appears to be three times her size - and for the films first third were happy enough to watch the couple as they whine and canoodle. But the erratic mix of slapstick and sincerity begins to feel increasingly queasy. Scenes cut on the punch line jokes repeat tender moments are disrupted with rude non-sequiturs. There are at least two movies here competing for the same space. The serious movie that might be extracted from the rubble could be called Scenes from a Pre-Marriage an almost convincing portrait of a mismatched couple realizing theyve grown apart in spite of their affection for each other. Violets initial attraction to this boy-man followed by disenchantment with his slovenly self-pitying behaviour is all-to-easy to understand. The inchoate comedy here like many Apatow scripts might be called Learning to Love Male Inadequacy. Emasculated by his role as ""faculty spouse"" Tom takes up with stay-at-home dad Bill ( Saturday Night Live veteran Chris Parnell) who knits oversized patterned sweaters and to prove his masculinity hunts deer. In a prolonged visual gag Tom goes primitive with a vengeance growing a patchy mountain-man beard hanging deer carcasses in his garage and serving guests homemade mead in bark cups which Alex suggests look like Chewbaccas penis. Ah yes the penises. Running throughout are Apatows familiar R-rated tricks with inappropriate profanities genital jokes male nudity and even a couple of amputated digits which provide if not actually laughs at least reactions. Students of Freud (Violet has a picture of Sigmund on her bedroom wall next to a Wham poster) might easily conclude this is all about castration-anxiety theory but what comes to mind is more basic. A lot more cutting would have made this movie much funnier - but it should have taken place in the editing room not on the screen.

Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Two youngish lovers keep postponing the big day. BOTTOM LINE A mildly amusing romantic comedy though its hard to care much about two people kept apart by nothing but their own apathy. CAST Jason Segel Emily Blunt Rhys Ifans. LENGTH 203 The youngish couple at the heart of ""The Five-Year Engagement"" fell in love the day they met but something is stopping them from getting married. Is it religion? Their social castes? A long-simmering blood feud? Those plot devices were long ago rendered obsolete by modern American life so whats the obstacle now? Nothing really except that Tom (Jason Segel) and Violet (Emily Blunt) seem easily distracted by lifes little curveballs and in no apparent hurry to make a decision. As a result ""The Five-Year Engagement"" becomes two things an accurate reflection of a new generation of postponement-prone 30-somethings and a rather uninteresting story. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Segel and Blunt make a likable pair but theyre playing demographic types not characters. Tom is a chef at a tony San Francisco restaurant (Chris Pratt plays his obnoxious sidekick Alex) and Violet is a burgeoning psych professor. In a gender-role reversal its Tom who derails his career by joining Violet in Ann Arbor where shes accepted a university post. As the wedding recedes into the future the guilt-inducing deaths of various grandparents provide a running gag. Most of the humor comes as West Coast Tom adjusts to inland Michigan (hunting jokes cold-weather jokes) which seems like a theme from a different comedy. There are some minor plot complications -- Violets predatory boss (Rhys Ifans) Toms sexy co-worker (Tracee Chimo) -- but theyre brief and unconvincing. Its also easy to lose patience with Violet whose commitment phobia is hinted at but never explained. Director Nicholas Stoller who co-wrote with Segel tries to liven things up with R-rated language and the odd icky joke (why is Violet barfing?) but hes facing an unsolvable dilemma. ""The Five-Year Engagement"" is a modern romantic comedy with none of the traditional pleasures. VideoThe Five-Year Engagement PLOT Two youngish lovers keep postponing the big day.

BOTTOM LINE A mildly amusing romantic comedy though its hard to care much about two people kept apart by nothing but their own apathy. MoviesOur critics top 20 favorite movies Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff The skinny on Jason Segels weight loss Jason Segel was ""forced to lose weight"" for his role in ""The Five-Year Engagement"" he said Monday night on ""Late Show With David Letterman."" So who put the hammer on Segel who also is the movies co-screenwriter? ""The studio president"" Segel told Letterman referring to Universal Pictures honcho Rob Meyer. ""I was told that it had to be conceivable that Emily Blunt would ever choose me to be her husband. Which is fair."" MoviesMovies based on TV shows A trainer was sent to the set so Segel could work out twice a day and the actors food was monitored as well according to CNN.com. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""I didnt enjoy it"" Segel said. ""But what they didnt anticipate is that Im very clever. I play a chef in the movie so there are a lot of scenes where I had to eat so I would pay my co-stars nominal amounts of money to mess up their lines during the scenes so I would get to keep eating."" Nevertheless Segel ended up dropping 35 pounds. Segel said he specifically wrote the role of his wife for Blunt even though hes good friends with the actress and her husband John Krasinski. In real life Segel who also stars in the CBS comedy ""How I Met Your Mother"" is dating actress Michelle Williams.

Emily Blunt brings a much-needed dose of reality -- and palpable chemistry with Jason Segel -- to the Judd Apatow school of raunchy screen comedy with the sweet and smart ""The Five-Year Engagement. It might not have as many gut-busting laughs as ""Bridesmaids but there are still plenty -- and for once in Apatows phallocentric universe most of them dont come at the expense of female characters. Blunt the spiky British actress who has brightened many films since her breakthrough in ""The Devil Wears Prada plays Violet a smart determined psychology graduate student who doesnt let love get in the way of her career plans. PHOTOS THE FIVE-YEAR ENGAGEMENT PREMIERE Shortly after their engagement her finance Tom (Segel) a sous chef at an upscale San Francisco restaurant gives up dreams of his own place there to move with her to Michigan where shes been accepted into a coveted two-year postgraduate program. Violet shines under the programs leader Winton (Rhys Ifans) despite the best efforts of a a wacky trio of classmates (Kevin Hart Mindy Kaling and Randall Park all quite funny). Tom though finds the only employer interested in his talents is a hippie sandwich shop. Bonding with his eccentric co-workers (Brian Posehn Chris Parnell) he grows a scruffy beard smokes a lot of weed and develops various other tics that begin driving a wedge between him and Violet. As wedding plans keep getting endlessly postponed -- the passage of the half-decade is marked by the funerals of all four of her grandparents -- Violet finds herself drawn to the charismatic Winton. And in turn Winton contrives to keep her in Michigan with a job at the university after the program ends. Adding to Violet and Toms frustration over their perpetually delayed nuptials is the whirlwind courtship between his alpha-male former boss (Chris Pratt) and Emilys sister (Alison Brie) who wed shortly after she becomes pregnant. There are thankfully fewer penis jokes than in your typical Apatow production. Segels anatomy is not as graphically exposed as it was in his previous collaboration with director Nicholas Stoller ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall though we do get an extended glimpse of his butt. ""The Five-Year Engagement is far more relatable than your typical Apatow man-boy fable -- Violet is much more than just a fantasy prop for the romantic Tom. This seems like another breakthrough for Blunt who demonstrates an ample gift for physical comedy. She and Segel make an inspired team. Like most of Apatows productions ""The Five-Year Engagement is about a half-hour too long. But this one has a payoff that makes it worth the wait.

Starring Emily Blunt Jason Segel Alison Brie Rhys Ifans Chris Pratt Kevin Hart Dakota Johnson Mindy Kaling Mimi Kennedy Randall Park Director Nicholas Stoller Running time 204 Release Opened Apr 27 2012  Editorial Review Worth the wait bunny suit and allBy Ann HornadayFriday Apr. 27 2012Is Jason Segel a man or a Muppet? In ""The Five-Year Engagement"" a running sight gag has the enormously adorable comic actor dressed in a pink bunny suit which his character Tom wore to the New Years Eve party where he met Violet (Emily Blunt). Shes dressed as a comely doe-eyed Princess Di and its no wonder that the two hit it off. Precisely one year later as ""The Five-Year Engagement"" opens Tom proposes to Violet in one of the cutest marry-me sequences staged in recent movie history. In fact the first 45 minutes or so of ""The Five-Year Engagement"" which Segel wrote with director Nicholas Stoller (""Get Him to the Greek"") pop and zing with both comic fizz and refreshing authenticity. Set to a delicious soundtrack dominated by Van Morrison standards Toms and Violets lives feel more real than the usual Hollywood confections with Tom working as a sous chef in a tony San Francisco restaurant and Violet anxiously awaiting acceptance to a postdoc psychology program. As the leading couple Blunt and Segel affect an easygoing mildly naughty banter (especially piquant delivered in Blunts refined plum-shaped tones) and theyre surrounded by terrific supporting players Alison Brie as Violets sister Suzie nails the gnarly technical challenge of delivering a tearful toast at an engagement party and moments later Chris Pratt as Toms best friend Alex delivers an equally funny wildly inappropriate encomium then proceeds to steal every scene hes in. ""The Five-Year Engagement"" hits a speed bump right when Tom and Violet do after they move to Michigan for Violets postdoc appointment. Tom cant find a job and winds up making sandwiches at the legendary Zingermans Deli; Violet comes under the sway of a flashy psych professor (played to pitch perfection by Rhys Ifans) and the two begin to grow apart. This is the blue period most romantic comedies gloss over with attractively sad montage sequences set to torchy ballads. But instead of rushing toward the expected third-act resolution Segel and Stoller dig in giving Toms deepening depression increasingly alarming physical cues from a set of unruly lamb chop facial whiskers to the now-filthy bunny suit which he wears on particularly aimless days. Trapped in the dreary snow banks of Ann Arbor at least Segel is definitely a Muppet. Because its so willing to drill down into Tom and Violets misery ""The Five-Year Engagement"" involves a higher grim-to-grin ratio than its fluffier brethren. Theres a particularly unsavory encounter at the deli after hours and someone winds up losing a body part. Those are the moments that make the two-hour ""Five-Year Engagement"" feel a half-hour too long. But theres an unmistakable ring of truth to the couples conflicts and mixed feelings. During one utterly on-point argument Tom insists he wants to be alone then balks when Violet gets up to leave the room. He didnt mean alone alone he meant together alone. Later Violet and her sister play out an argument entirely in Cookie Monster and Elmo voices. Those are the moments that make that extra half-hour if not narratively entirely necessary at least worth it. In keeping with the current trend of R-rated romcoms - and because this is a Judd Apatow production - ""The Five-Year Engagement"" has its fair share of gratuitous profanity mostly delivered by a foul-mouthed Zingerman colleague of Toms. His compulsive interjections feel out of place in a movie that even at its darkest and weirdest seems intent on being as sweet as it is brutally honest. I liked ""The Five-Year Engagement"" and then I didnt and then I did - which seems just about right for a movie dedicated to examining how even the purest affections can be fatally derailed.Contains sexual content and profanity throughout.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Glen Wilson) Glen Wilson In this film image released by Universal Pictures Jason Segel left and Emily Blunt are shown in a scene from ""The Five-Year Engagement."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Glen Wilson) Aprils flow of romances continues with ""The Five-Year Engagement"" an R-rated entry that comes on the heels of ""Think Like a Man"" and ""The Lucky One.""""The Five-Year Engagement"" looks to coast on its ""from the producers of Bridesmaids"" pedigree but dont be fooled into believing that these matrimonial ties bind.The film is neither funny nor raunchy enough for that to be true though its certainly long enough. (Whats with these two-hour romantic comedies?) There are enough F-bombs a couple of chopped-off appendages and a flash of gratuitous male nudity to earn an R rating. But fans of producer Judd Apatow would expect nothing less.In a slow-motion flashback Tom (Jason Segel) and Violet (Emily Blunt) meet at a New Years Eve party he in a bunny costume she as Princess Diana. A year later he messily but comically proposes to her on a restaurant rooftop where fireworks go off as they kiss.And thats the most movement this couples relationship sees for a long time as the title implies. Tom a rising-star chef in San Francisco quits his job to move to Michigan where Violet has accepted a spot in a doctoral program. The best Tom can do is take a job at a sandwich shop and his downward spiral begins.Meanwhile Toms cook buddy Alex (Chris Pratt of ""Parks and Recreation"") and Violets sister Suzie (Alison Brie of ""Mad Men"" and ""Community"") have no problem meeting marrying and procreating. But Tom and Violet just cant seem to pull it together. At best ""The Five-Year Engagement"" is very well played by its leads and supporting characters. You cant go wrong with Segel Blunt Pratt and Brie the latter two TV stars who are movie-ready.""The Five-Year Engagement""Two and a half stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 204  Content Sexual content and language Find theaters and showtimes for The Five-Year Engagement Apr 26 2012 (...)

Comments click to enlarge The Five-Year Engagement Rated R  124 minutes  2012 Jason Segel is the ideal rom-com star for women who find Woody Allen too macho. In movies like Forgetting Sarah Marshall Bad Teacher and now The Five-Year Engagement Segel plays the sort of sensitive considerate moony doughy everyman that most American women end up with (if theyre lucky). For the guys dragged along to see these movies theres the implicit promise that being sensitive and considerate (if not moony or doughy) will score you a babe like Mila Kunis Cameron Diaz or Emily Blunt respectively. Segel is a pretty funny writer though and this story of a promising sous chef who sacrifices his career in San Francisco to follow his girlfriend to Ann Arbor delivers a steady stream of character laughs along with a rigidly formulaic plot and Segels usual contrived and overblown ending.

Jason Segel and Emily Blunt Balance Romance and Career in The Five-Year Engagement. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 26 2012 723 PM The Five-Year Engagement Jason Segel and Emily Blunt balance romance and career in an amiable if underachieving Apatovian comedy. By Dana Stevens Tom (Jason Segel) and Violet (Emily Blunt) keep having their nuptials delayed in The Five-Year Engagement Glen Wilson. Universal Studios 2012. Click on the audio player below to listen to Slates Spoiler Special podcast on The Five-Year Engagement after youve seen the movie. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Five-Year Engagement directed by Nicholas Stoller and co-written by Stoller and the films star Jason Segel is like the square older cousin of the 2008 Stoller/Segel collaboration Forgetting Sarah Marshall. The two films have in common a structural formlessness which in Sarah Marshalls case felt freewheeling and fun When the boy-gets-girl plot would suddenly pause for a music-video parody or a number from a puppet musical it was all part of the movies loosey-goosey charm. But The Five Year Engagement has all the formlessness with half the fun. Where Forgetting Sarah Marshall frolicked on the beach this amiable but underachieving comedy just sort of blobs on the couch. Perhaps this lack of direction is appropriate in a movie thats about both romantic and professional inertia. Tom (Jason Segel) and Violet (Emily Blunt) are a young San Francisco couple who are just getting engaged as the movie begins Hes an ambitious sous-chef at a trendy restaurant shes an aspiring psych professor. Soon after the engagement Violets dream of getting a teaching position at Berkeley falls through; instead shes offered a postdoc fellowship at the University of Michigan. The Ann Arbor chamber of commerce should sue this films producers for implying that that their cosmopolitan college town is an haute-cuisine-deprived backwater where a chef with Toms experience would be reduced to serving sandwiches at a deli (even if that deli is the legendary Zingermans). In Michigan Violet experiences a professional blossoming Shes thrilled with her adviser (Rhys Ifans) and her fellow postdocs even though as played by Mindy Kaling Randall Park and Kevin Hart they seem more like lovable crackpots than stimulating colleagues. But in a slacker spin on A Star Is Born Violets career is rising even as Toms falls. Underemployed and depressed he grows hideous frontier-man sideburns and takes to hunting game with a similarly emasculated faculty spouse (Chris Parnell). Advertisement Most of the films best moments come in this middle section as we watch the couple deal with the strain and anxiety of deciding whose needs should be put first and for how long. Unlike many obstacles in romantic-comedy plots this is one a lot of real people have experienced and at its sharpest the script can be quite perceptive about the passive-aggressive politics of conjugal compromise. A scene with the couple fighting in bed perfectly illustrates the martyr dynamic at work ""I want to be alone"" Tom tells Violet furiously only to insist that she come back in the room and bear witness to his anguished solitude. Though its mildly raunchy in the Apatow style (he co-produced) The Five-Year Engagement like most of the films Segels co-written also allows its female characters to be recognizable human beings with senses of humor and personality traits other than niceness. Both Violet and her sister Suzie (Alison Brie) are funny flawed believable characters even if the subplot of Suzies shotgun marriage to Toms best friend Alex (Chris Pratt) feels like an underwritten foil for the main couples story. Its too bad The Five-Year Engagements overlong conventional last third squanders the goodwill built up in that sharply observed middle section. Without giving away too much I can say that Tom and Violets relationship grows progressively rockier--culminating in the traditional third-act separation montage scored to a poignant pop song--and that by the end the couples mutual ambivalence and latent hostility are thrown to the winds as the sacredness of the marriage bond--or at least of the cloyingly cute wedding sequence--is reaffirmed. I would have loved it if The Five-Year Engagement had had the courage to let its lead couple reunite in a tentative provisional way starting to trust each other again but not yet daring to pick out a font for the save-the-date cards. Instead the denouement is so overcompensatory in its giddiness that we cant quite believe that Violet and Tom have a shot at resolving the legitimate conflicts that tore them apart. Were left with the sinking sense that if this movie had a sequel it might have to be called The Six-Year Marriage. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

There are funny scenarios and sweet moments but not nearly enough in this screenplay co-written by Segel and director Nicholas Stoller. VIDEO Segel Blunt talk Engagement at NYC premiereSTORY Finances dream weddings can lead to long engagementsTom (Segel) and Violet (Blunt) meet at a costume party where hes dressed as a pink bunny and shes Princess Diana. They fall in love and Tom proposes a year later at the San Francisco restaurant where hes a sous chef. Violet says yes. But Violet whos training to be a psychologist is offered a position at the University of Michigan. So off they go to Ann Arbor believing theyll postpone the wedding for a short while. Two years slides into three and Tom is professionally frustrated. Meanwhile Violet has caught the eye of her dynamic psych adviser (Ifans) as she works alongside fellow grad students (including The Offices Kaling) on a particularly inane experiment involving stale donuts.About the movieThe Five-Year Engagement out of fourStars Jason Segel Emily Blunt Chris Pratt Rhys Ifans Director Nicholas StollerDistributor Universal Pictures Rating R for sexual content and language throughout Running time 2 hours 4 minutes Opens Friday nationwideAlmost as silly is a recurring scene in which Tom looks for a chef gig and the owners of a local Indian restaurant explode in laughter at the notion of someone leaving San Francisco for Ann Arbor. Engagement was filmed on location so the Michigan Film Office may not be thrilled about how this university town is depicted as a redneck backwater.Tom has spent so much time in the wintry clime that he grows mutton chops brews mead and becomes an avid deer hunter. He serves up all venison all the time and the beer steins are covered in deer pelts. Its a funny visual but the dialogue and situational humor dont measure up. And the films tendency to repeat middling jokes merely comes off as annoying.Perhaps the tale of a couple who love each other and live together but cant find a date to get hitched doesnt provide enough conflict. Elderly grandparents are shoehorned in to provide an element of pressure. Apparently the dying wishes of relatives on both sides is to see Tom and Violet marry.It is far-fetched that Tom and Violet might not end up together. So the two hours of misunderstandings intended to keep them apart feel unnecessary. And while each of the actors is individually engaging they lack chemistry as a couple.Judd Apatow is the producer and some of his trademark themes are touched on mostly dealing with men struggling to leave their boyish selves behind and grow up.A few scenes between Violet and her sister Suzie (Alison Brie) --especially a Muppets-inspired one -- have a naturally comic quality. Sequences with Tom and his doltish pal Alex (Pratt) dont take advantage of the comic charms of either actor.There is a ludicrous scene involving a cross-bow that while its not terribly funny is something at least not seen before in a movie.About midway through longing visions of tacky Vegas churches begin to dance in ones head. By the time a wedding dress is donned and vows are intoned The Five-Year Engagement feels like it took place in real time. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

"""The Five-Year Engagement"" a missed opportunity movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review The Five-Year Engagement a missed opportunityThe rom-com has an engaging premise but promises more than it can deliver ultimately getting lost in subplots and awkward changes in tone.April 27 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Jason Segel and Emily Blunt play a couple having a difficult time taking... (Glen Wilson / Universal...)The romantic comedy ""The Five-Year Engagement"" starring Emily Blunt and Jason Segel tackles the messy business of love in a time when commitment can be career-ending for one of the better halves. Since it is mostly told from a fairly evolved guys point of view it sounds so promising so fresh you want to root for these kids to get it right a not just the couple but the filmmakers.Both have their moments though not enough to keep the audience or the couple engaged for anything close to five years which this two-hour film can sometimes feel like. There are so many detours taken by director Nicholas Stoller and co-writer Segel in trying to twist the typical rom-com tropes they derail the movie as often as the wedding plans shortchanging the smart special comedy ""Engagement"" had the potential to be.Despite the rocky road to romance the lovebirds at the heart of things are an appealing pair. San Francisco sous chef Tom (Segel) starts this fling with a proposal to psychology grad student Violet (Blunt) on a rooftop garden overlooking the Bay Bridge. Their initial meet-cute moment at a New Years Eve costume party with Tom dressed as a giant pink bunny and Violet as Princess Di gets played in multiple flashbacks enough that the mere sight of the bunny begins to inspire ""Oh no not again"" dread.At the engagement party the complications begin in earnest with the filmmakers throwing everything conceivable literally and figuratively in their way. The hurdles designed to test their relationship (and our patience) also provide all the subplots and ancillary roles for this sprawling cast. The two most significant snags come from near a courtesy of Toms best friend Alex (Chris Pratt) and Violets sister Suzie (Alison Brie); and far a a University of Michigan teaching fellowship with Ann Arbor about as far as they could get from a San Francisco state of mind.Before Tom and Violet finally decide whether or not they ""do"" there will be experiments with food a from doughnuts to deer meat a problems with their romance and marriage advice from but not limited to Toms still-married parents (Mimi Kennedy and David Paymer) Violets long-divorced parents (Jacki Weaver and Jim Piddock) his grandparents her grandparents Violets professor (Rhys Ifans) her research colleagues (inc/luding Mindy Kaling) some Pakistani chefs a priest and a rabbi.As the couple works through their issues Tom and Violet arent the only ones who are conflicted. At times the film plays like farce a a painful crossbow misfire an improbable parkour action scene in an Ann Arbor alleyway. At other times such as when Toms discontent surfaces the film shifts to relationship drama in ways that are interesting yet out of sync with the general tone. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"") must have had to scramble to keep up with the mood changes and the one-off comic bits that keep turning up.Blunt one of the most consistently excellent actresses around makes her moments count the most as Violet blossoms and wilts with career success and relationship troubles sailing through the movies many mood swings. At first Segel gets to dig a little deeper than usual exploring Toms Renaissance-man side but before long the character returns to doofus dude-ville where he tends to reside. Pratt has a couple of scene-stealing moments playing with Alexs tendency toward the inappropriate in nearly every situation.In many ways ""Engagement"" reflects both the best and worst of Stoller and Segels creative collaborations. They have a history that goes back to at least TVs 2001 series ""Undeclared"" one of Judd Apatows excellent underachievers which Stoller wrote for and Segel acted in. Their breakout film 2008s""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (Stoller directed Segel wrote and starred) introduced the kind of sweetness amid the raunchy riffs that have come to characterize their work.In last years""The Muppets""which they co-wrote with Segel starring they went for nostalgic charm along with off-center rather than off-color humor and succeeded grandly. But in ""Engagement"" they are playing so fast and so loose that things simply get sloppy when a little restraint would have gone a long way to making this a far funnier fleeter affair.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Plimpton an engaging life story told in...June 7 2013Movie review Brothers JusticeMay 12 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentTomEngagementVioletCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-five-year-engagement-20120427,0,1583209.story?track=rss",200,thefive-yearengagement21,thefive-yearengagement,latimes

But it still seems a major act of dawdling for director Nicholas Stoller to take 123 minutes to get to the end credits of this affable but uneven romantic comedy. Every hillock and pothole on the road to happiness for nice-guy chef Tom (Jason Segel) and his fiancee nice-girl grad student Violet (Emily Blunt) is painstakingly chronicled and the movie persists until every cast member has either seen Segels nude rump (no full frontal for him the way there was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall although theres much discussion of his member) or done his or her part to contribute to the movies R-rating for language. By the 90-minute mark I was ready for a divorce but based on the steady squeals of laughter around me at a preview screening may have been in the minority. Segel and Stoller who wrote the screenplay together have certainly done well as a team in the past. They co-wrote The Muppet Movie and Stoller directed Segel in 2008s Forgetting Sarah Marshall another Segel screenplay. They imbue Engagement with a Sarah Marshall-style mix of raunchy humor and sweet sincerity the kind that allows for pokeinggentle fun at sensitive topics like Princess Diana and September 11 without seeming nasty. Violet is wearing a Princess Diana costume on the night she and Tom first meet in San Francisco. Theyre at an alternative super-hero New Years Eve party and Tom dressed as a pinky bunny wants to know what Dianas superpower is. ""Princess Diana doesnt require a super power"" Blunt says crisply. I believe the bunny would have shuffled off to get himself another bong hit but they are holding hands by the stroke of midnight. (Throughout the movie the couple revisits these scenes in flashback so many times it starts to seem as like a Rashomon-homage except that nothing different ever happens.) When they get engaged a year later Violet plans the wedding while waiting to hear whether shes going to Berkeley for a post-doc. (LIST Top 10 Romantic Movies) No such luck. Only the University of Michigan wants her and Tom has to give up his fancy sous chef job to relocate to Ann Arbor where Violet is mentored by a charismatic Welsh professor (Rhys Ifans) who obviously finds her fetching. The wedding is delayed until they can get back to a place worth getting married in. Ann Arbor has a good reputation in most circles but Five-Year depicts it as dismal and provincial enough to cause a normal stable fellow like Tom to lose his mind and his mojo. Two winters in the place and hes got three dead deer hanging in the garage and is wearing handknit sweaters as unpleasantly furry as the mutton chops growing on his face (both of which make for good sight gags). Here at last is Five-Years strength. It aptly explores the notion of sacrifice for a relationship and simultaneously portrays an aspect of young adult life that movies usually neglect namely the necessary adaptation to a place letting it envelope you even against your will while you long to return to a former life light-years cooler. If Tom were still in San Francisco hed be executive chef at a wildly successful restaurant called Clam Bar. Instead hes making sandwiches at a place called Zingermans. Hes miserable but hes trying to make the best of the situation because he truly loves Violet and she truly loves him. And her career ""Academia is my life Tom"" she says during pillow talk. The relationship evolves within the framework of her success and his sacrifice. Its aiming in its silly way to be Scenes from a Almost-Marriage. Neither Tom nor Violet are demonized or do anything idiotic which is a refreshing change from most romantic comedies. The chemistry between Segel and Blunt is another matter. Theyre very jolly but more in the cozy manner of brother and sister than actual couple. Their kisses appear more a matter of fierce adhesion than sensual exploration as if theyve smashed their mouths together and cant pry them apart. (And its not a matter of Blunt being out of his league in terms of looks; I bought the pairing of Segel and Mila Kunis in Sarah Marshall and Segel and Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher.) Even their acting styles dont feel natural in tandem; Blunt is crisp and coolly cerebral while Segel is all sloppy emotive heart. Opposites certainly can and do attract but these two never convinced me of any real passion between Tom and Violet. (PHOTOS Emily Blunt Modeling Haute Couture for TIME) But thats not the key reason the movie seems interminable. Five-Year has comic bloat. Virtually every character gets their own moment of stand up but in most cases the bits arent funny enough to warrant the screen time. Even the brilliant Mindy Kaling who plays one of the sitcommy gang of post-docs Violet hangs out with only gets off a good line one out of four attempts. Chris Pratt and Alison Brie (of TVs Community and Mad Men) who play respectively Toms best friend and Violets sister fare slightly better though Id trade Pratts oafish Five-Year character for his much funnier oafish Parks and Recreation character any day. Often the effort to give everyone a chance to generate laughs translates into cheap stunts or freakish behavior. Comedy should be generous and Stoller and Segel are nothing if not generous filmmakers. Thats all well and good on set but you know when its time to get stingy? During editing.

Watch a clip from the film ""Headhunters."" Video courtesy of Magnolia Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern April 26 2012 500 p.m. ET Height matters. Thats the short and long of it for the charming sometimes bumbling hero of this one-of-a-kind thriller. At 5 feet 6 inches Roger Brown looks up to his gorgeous statuesque wife with anxiety. ""You dont need a Ph.D."" he tells us early on ""to realize that I overcompensate for my height."" Nor do you need one to realize that Roger Norways leading corporate headhunter and an avocational art thief is over his head when his heist of a priceless Rubens goes fearfully wrong. ""Headhunters"" in Norwegian with English subtitles was directed by Morten Tyldum and was based on a novel by the Norwegian crime writer Jo Nesbo. A transgenre thriller that glides effortlessly from crisp social commentary through off-kilter comedy to paranoid terror its on my short list of the most enjoyable movies in recent memory. ENLARGE Aksel Hennie in Headhunters. Magnet Releasing The enjoyment starts with the cast. Aksel Hennies fair complexion and his open face with its finely chiseled yet mobile features give Roger an air of amused expectancy that slowly turns into a taut stare of terror. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is fiercely focused as a former commando and would-be CEO Clas Greven who knows more than a model executive should about the dark arts of corporate espionage and GPS tracking. Between them stands--or towers--Synnove Macody Lund as the aptly named Diana Rogers goddess of a spouse who might be relegated to the status of decoration in a lesser film. In this one its affecting for us and revelatory for Roger when she asks him toward the end ""Who do you think I am?"" GPS technology is pivotal to what is essentially a trackdown plot. In that sense ""Headhunters"" is a digital update of Francis Ford Coppolas 1974 classic ""The Conversation"" with Rogers head--whats on it rather than whats in it--as an analog to the apartment that Gene Hackmans surveillance expert tears apart in a frantic attempt to find a bug. The intricacies of the book as adapted by Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryberg track lucidly enough with Roger going through all sorts of hell for reasons he cant comprehend. Still there comes a point when the movie must be taken at its word that everything is working out as its supposed to. Character development is essential to effective drama and this reluctant hero a late arrival to the realm of deadly weapons develops impressively. From the standpoint of craftsmanship the most impressive development is the directors gift for negotiating changes of tone with perfect aplomb. ""Headhunters"" is smart funny scary and surprising so its hardly any wonder that an American version is in the works. The big question is whether the remake can measure up. Bernie Bernie Tiede (Jack Black) is a small town mortician who befriends wealthy widow Marjorie Nugent (Shirley MacLaine) but when its discovered Marjorie is dead Bernie is charged with her murder. Watch a clip from ""Bernie."" Video courtesy of Millennium Entertainment. Movies can teach you the damnedest things. In Richard Linklaters ""Bernie"" the title character an assistant funeral director played by Jack Black explains the concept of lip drift. Its when a corpses sealed lips come apart in what seems to be a smile. Lip drift is bad--""You cannot have grief tragically becoming comedy"" Bernie notes--so the solution is to reseal the lips with superglue. The movie itself a partly true and cheerfully embellished account of a Texas murder case presents a case of narrative drift. Its when the story is taken over by townspeople talking about it. This is neither bad nor accidental but a deliberate structural choice with an unintended consequence--the picturesque locals become more entertaining than Bernie himself. ENLARGE Jack Black in Bernie Millennium Entertainment The real-life character Bernie Tiede was one of the most beloved residents of Carthage a tiny town in rural East Texas. His belovedness diminished little if at all after the discovery in the late 1990s that he had murdered his constant companion a wealthy and notoriously sour-souled widow named Marjorie Nugent. (Mr. Tiede is currently serving a life sentence and will be eligible for parole in 2027.) The fictional Bernie is a comic character fey and prim for whom grief is a funeral-parlor abstraction. Mr. Black plays him with restraint apart from brief spasms of self-enchantment and has great fun in the process. (One of the best of Bernies bits is his rendition of ""76 Trombones"" in an amateur production of ""The Music Man."") Shirley MacLaine however makes a remote and unfunny Marjorie. Here again her taciturn characterization is clearly a choice just not an interesting one. Matthew McConaugheys district attorney Danny Buck Davidson flirts with self-parody but mostly resists the flirtation. Where the movie is at its best is in the comically laconic straight-to-the-camera remarks offered by Carthages residents. (Theyre played by a mix of local actors and real townspeople doing partially scripted versions of themselves.) Mr. Linklater is no stranger to such techniques. Ever since his 1991 ""Slacker"" he has enjoyed meandering down twisted paths with characters encountered or invented along the way. But this element of ""Bernie"" isnt so much a meander as a pungent meditation on the hero and the importance of being nice. Its the lean steak that sells the stylized sizzle. Sounds of My Voice The film ""Sound of My Voice"" follows two documentary filmmakers as they investigate a cult leader who claims to have traveled back from the future. Watch a clip from ""Sound of My Voice."" Video courtesy of Fox Searchlight. Less than a year ago Brit Marling made an indelible impression as the star of ""Another Earth"" a small-scale drama with an eerie sci-fi dimension that she wrote with the director Mike Cahill. Now shes back as the star and co-writer--with first-time director Zal Batmanglij--of a smaller-scale drama with an intentionally creepy spiritual dimension. Smaller overstates the scale. ""Sound of My Voice"" is a chamber piece shot digitally on a frayed shoestring with Ms. Marling as Maggie an enigmatic beauty who could be as she claims a time-traveler from the future or is less mysteriously the cynical priestess of a crackpot cult in the San Fernando Valley. The film is thin and mannered even though many of the mannerisms are intrinsic to its shrewd vision of cult behavior. Theres no arguing though--and who would want to?--Ms. Marlings extraordinary gift for taking the camera and weaving a spell. ENLARGE Christopher Denham and Brit Marling in Sound of My Voice. Fox Searchlight If Maggie is a fraud shes an alluring fraud. If shes a drop-in from 2054 shes as remarkable for her anger and truculence as she is for her blissed-out empathy. One of the highlights of ""Another Earth"" was a scene in which Ms. Marlings Rhoda a former student with a heavy cargo of guilt tells a mesmerizing story about a Russian cosmonaut. The strongest sequence here has Maggie attacking berating breaking down and finally breaking through to Peter (Christopher Denham) an unpleasant documentary filmmaker who has infiltrated Maggies inner circle in order to expose it. ""Sound of My Voice"" has other strengths that speak well for the people who made it warm and intimate cinematography by Rachel Morrison; evocative music by the directors brother Rostam Batmanglij and the resourceful work of the director who isnt from the future but has a future thats conspicuously bright. The Five-Year Engagement Jason Segel and Emily Blunt star in the comedy ""The Five Year Engagement"" about a couples long journey to get down the isle. Watch a clip from ""The Five Year Engagement."" Video courtesy of Universal Pictures. Sometime around what I guessed to be the one-hour mark in ""The Five-Year Engagement"" I checked my watch and honestly thought the battery had given out. Five years doesnt begin to tell the interminable tale. This mirthless romcom from the Judd Apatow laugh factory stars Jason Segel and Emily Blunt as Tom and Violet a couple who you guessed it keep failing to tie the knot. (Mr. Segel wrote the script with the director Nicholas Stoller.) Tom is a San Francisco sous chef who cant assert himself. Violet goes off to Michigan to pursue a job in academic psychology. He pursues her keeps trying to please her and finally finds his anger. I found mine long before he did. Whatever tied these two excellent performers to such a dim script? The question is rhetorical the answer is hope and contracts. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Happy Happy (2011) This casually daring debut feature by the Norwegian director Anne Sewitsky had a theatrical run in a handful of U.S. theaters seven months ago but memories are short and the run was shorter. The movie mixes and purposely mismatches light and dark moods to tell the story of Kaja a rural wife and mother looking for happiness in the wrong places and finally in the right one. Vulnerable in ways we can only intuit at first Kaja is played with unsettling good cheer by Agnes Kittelsen. Joachim Rafaelsen is Eirik her prickly husband. The script was written by Ragnhild Tronvoll. The School of Rock (2003) Jack Black found his mojo in a movie that gives the lie to Norma Desmonds deathless remark about the pictures having gotten small. This joyous farce is a big deal and its star is nothing less than majestic as a scruffy irreverent rocker passing himself off as a pedagogue in a private school. Mike Whites dazzling script and Richard Linklaters ebullient direction are fully equal to the challenge of morphing Mr. Blacks Dewey Finn from a dissolute mooch into a madcap Mr. Chips who turns a bunch of rigid preteens into a rock band for the ages. The Muppets (2011) Jason Segel was a co-star (with Amy Adams and Chris Cooper) and the co-writer (with Nicholas Stoller) of this endearing revival of the Muppet mythos. But why you may ask am I recommending a movie that was hugely successful last year and has not been forgotten in the interim? Because it allows me to make amends for not running a review. In advance of last years opening a devoted Disney publicist kept telling me ""The Muppets"" was really good and I would like it. She was right of course but I was dubious and managed to miss all the screenings. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com 2 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Case in point the moment in ""The Five-Year Engagement"" when slobbish chef Alex (Chris Pratt) sings to his gobsmacked bride Suzie (Alison Brie). Mind you its not just any song hes chosen; Alex is doing a full-on eyes-closed cover of Caetano Velosos version of ""Cucurrucucu Paloma"" a song best known for its connections to art-house faves like ""Talk to Her"" and ""Happy Together."" The thing is Pratt isnt lampooning the song. He sings it with such utter sincerity and such obliviousness to the I-really-mean-this faces that Alex is pulling that the whole rendition is rendered hilarious. Its a moment that speaks volumes about the Apatow oeuvre Characters are often funniest when they discard all pretense and speak directly from the heart. People may still talk about Jason Segels frontal nudity in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" -- Segel reteams with that films co-writer and director Nicholas Stoller here -- but its the emotional nakedness of the characters that makes these movies work. Also read Tribeca Opening Night Raunchy Judd Apatow Cleans Up With Five-Year Engagement Observation 2 about the films of producer Judd Apatow Theyre too damn long but the journey is generally so worthwhile its a flaw that audiences are generally willing to forgive like the halitosis of a beloved aunt. ""Bridesmaids"" ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" ""Knocked Up"" and especially ""Funny People"" are all terrific movies but they could each stand to lose about 20 minutes. So it goes with ""The Five-Year Engagement"" which tracks the pitfalls and byways that Tom (Jason Segel) and Violet (Emily Blunt) encounter on the way to the altar. The results are delightful but there are moments during the comedy where you feel like youre experiencing their lives in real time. In many ways Tom and Violet are a typical rom-com couple from their meet-cute at a costume party (hes in a bunny outfit shes Princess Diana) to Toms elaborately choreographed proposal on the rooftop of the San Francisco restaurant where he works as a sous chef. But in the same way that Segel and Stoller took the high concept of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and ran with it to Eric Rohmer territory ""Engagement"" dares to examine the decidedly un-Hollywood realities of relationships careers and compromises. Violet hopes to do her post-doctoral work in psychology at Berkeley so that she can stay in San Francisco but she doesnt get in. Instead she gets accepted at the University of Michigan so Tom walks away from his booming culinary career by the bay and winds up making really good bagel sandwiches in a snow-covered college town. Like the recent underrated ""Going the Distance"" this is a movie that acknowledges that regular folks cant just spend a fortune on airline tickets at the drop of a hat -- sometimes keeping a relationship alive means that one of the two people involved has to pack up and move to a city that isnt where they want to be. And the resentment of that move begins to build up in Tom to the point where he becomes a shaggy-bearded hunter who serves venison at every meal and brews his own mead. Canceled weddings tense reconciliations and what-are-we-doing discussions follow. ""Engagement"" features the sharp dialogue oddball supporting characters (including Chris Parnell as a househusband whose ineptly knitted sweaters come out like a unique form of outsider art) and R-rated clever bawdiness weve come to expect from the Apatow label and Segel and Blunt make for such a believable and charismatic screen couple that its hard not to root for them to work things out and finally get to say their vows -- they manage to make this will-they-or-wont-they plot really matter. (And heaven only knows what Frank Oz who loudly objected to Segel and Stollers script for ""The Muppets"" will make of the wildly funny scene where Blunt and Brie entertain a young child by having a very adult conversation in Elmo and Cookie Monster voices.) Hey if Tom and Violet can make it through half a decade of occasional mistrust and lifes random curveballs then fans of ""The Five-Year Engagement"" can endure several minutes of excess movie.

Fair warning If youre in a relationship in trouble ""The Five-Year Engagement"" will probably seem like the date movie from hell. One of the softest least crass offerings from the Judd Apatow production factory its a romantic comedy about Tom (Jason Segel who co-wrote the script) and Violet (Emily Blunt). Theyre adorably in love from frame one and when in the opening scene he proposes to her on a magical New Years Eve in San Francisco you may be forgiven for wondering where the story can possibly go from here.Not so much south as east it turns out. Toms a sous chef on the rise and Violets looking for a doctoral program in psychology which she eventually finds in far-off Michigan. The relocation is played for passive-aggressive farce as Tom obligingly puts his career on the back burner and follows his soulmate to the snowy Midwest. The wedding gets postponed. Then it gets postponed again. Then -- you get the idea.Its a fairly bizarre concept for a snuggle-up flick less a falling-in-love story than a trying-to-keep-love-alive story. While Violet finds success in her field (Rhys Ifans is her rakish professor and Mindy Kaling Kevin Hart and Randall Park play her fellow PhD candidates) Tom slowly falls into heartland inertia. He gets a job making sandwiches at a deli run by Brian Posehn as a cracker-barrel nutjob and goes hunting with dweeby house-husband Chris Parnell. Hes boiling mad but doesnt know where to put his anger and neither does the movie. ""Five-Year Engagement"" alternates between realistic scenes of couples bickering and broad character farce and the two halves mesh uneasily. By the time Segel starts wearing a patently fake mountain-man beard you may wonder what happened to the cute reasonably perceptive movie we started out with.""The Five-Year Engagement"" is pleasant and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny and the preview audience I saw it with -- mostly women in groups of two or three -- ate it up. Theres no reason for it to go on for over two hours though. Between that opening proposal and the films title you know exactly whats going to happen and the result is a comedy-drama almost completely free of dramatic tension. Under co-writer Nicholas Stollers smooth uninspired direction the various roadblocks come along at predictable intervals the drunken dalliances with others the last-minute misunderstandings. If last years art-house romance ""Like Crazy"" had been remade by a computer it might look like this.Were left then with the actors and their dialogue and thats almost enough. Between last years ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and the upcoming ""Your Sisters Sister"" Blunt has been loosening up her officious screen persona and shes pliant and soulful here. Segel can do lumpy nice-guy in his sleep. We believe in these two as a couple; their rhythms are the rhythms of people who are genuinely comfortable with each other. We watch the movie not hoping theyll get it together but waiting for them to outlast the plot.I wish there had been more scenes with Chris Pratt as Toms sweetly doltish brother and Alison Brie as Violets sister a goofy pill. These two become a couple too and their rhythms dont match up at all -- thats the comedy. Brie especially grabs at the chance to break out of her TV rut (shes on ""Community"" and plays Pete Campbells much-abused wife Trudy on ""Mad Men"") and her performance dab British accent and all is the films freshest surprise. One of the funnier scenes in ""The Five-Year Engagement"" involves Violet and her sister having a tense family argument while talking in the voices of Elmo and Cookie Monster; once its over you can feel the movie sigh and get back to the business at hand.Which is curiously retrograde when you stop to think about it. (Trust me the movie doesnt want you to.) The message of ""The Five-Year Engagement"" is that men subordinate themselves to their fiancees careers at their peril -- that putting your bliss on hold while the woman you love follows hers is antithetical to the essence of Guyness. Which may be true and at least this cautionary tale urges its hero to speak whats in his heart rather than give in with a martyrs shrug. The filmmakers still could have dug deeper. There are a few ""daring"" shock-jokes here to remind us were at an Apatow movie but a more genuinely daring movie might have reversed the genders and explored Violets emotional agita as she gives up everything for Tom. That wouldnt be a comedy though. That would be life.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter tyburr. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> The plot such as it is keeps creating obstacles to delay the marriage of  Tom and Violet. Thats it. Sometimes those obstacles - like Tom having to give up his job to move to Michigan so Violet can get her doctorate - seem so contrived you want to grab a bullhorn and shout ""break up already"" But Segel and Blunt are a dream pair of bruised romantics. And Stoller has a gift for bringing out the best in  supporting players - Chris Pratt as Toms zany chef buddy; Brian Posehn as Toms pickle-obsessed boss at Zingermans deli in Ann Arbor; Animal Kingdom Oscar nominee Jacki Weaver as Violets peppery mom; Rhys Ifans as a psych prof with his eye on Violet; Mindy Kaling as Violets researcher pal; and Chris Parnell as Toms fellow faculty husband. Best of all is the dynamite Alison Brie (Pete Campbells wife on Mad Men) as Violets sister Suzie. A scene late in the film with the sisters  trying to have an adult talk in front of Suzies kids is a laugh riot mostly because Suzie speaks in the voice of Elmo while Violet does Cookie Monster. OK you have to be there but the moment is memorably hilarious. The Five-Year Engagement is like that moving in fits and starts but building a rooting interest in its characters that slaps a goofy smile on your face and keeps it there.

Matt Gillmer Tonya Fode Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Like a delectable meal that goes on too long ""The Five-Year Engagement"" continues past gratification to overindulgence. Its a very good movie. If a tough editor trimmed it from 124 minutes to 90 it would be wonderful. One of the main reasons why Judd Apatow has become a brand name in entertainment is that he produces movies that are very very funny while featuring characters that resemble regular human beings. His latest production starring Jason Segel and Emily Blunt concerns two imperfect exasperating well intentioned ordinary people who trip themselves up on a daily basis. Theyre a lot like what most of us see in the mirror only with better dialogue. They are disarming precisely because they werent designed to be likable. They are sympathetic despite their foibles like most of our friends. In ""The Five-Year Engagement"" Segel plays Tom a cuddly talented assistant chef at a swank San Francisco restaurant. Hes had quite a run of romantic luck -- the film slyly implies that a heterosexual guy there can have a Hefnerian love life even if he looks like Jason Segel. All that is behind him though because he has met his one true love. Blunt plays Violet an English psychology grad with ambitions for post-doctoral work a faculty position and tons of kids. Theyre sweet together and -- despite minor skirmishes with the prospective in-laws -- eager for their impending marriage. As the big day approaches however life becomes a series of hurdles distractions and delays. Violet gets a great academic offer from the University of Michigan where she does research on impulse control and doughnuts. Glen Wilson Universal Pictures Jason Segel left and Emily Blunt are shown in a scene from ""The Five-Year Engagement."" Supportive Tom puts his promising culinary career on hold to work the counter at an Ann Arbor deli (in a nice touch its Zingermans the best nosh in the Midwest). Violet blooms under the guidance of her congenial mentor (Rhys Ifans). Tom swallows his disappointment with life in this snowbound limbo. Seasons pass years pass Tom and Violet enter an unexpected cooling-off period and so does the film. Tom takes up hunting with a faculty husband (Chris Parnell of ""SNL"") yielding several brilliantly executed sight gags that have a horrifying fascination. As his self-esteem deflates he finds himself literally turning into another person adapting to his new location by morphing into a poor mans Grizzly Adams. Violet senses his unspoken bitterness and seeks consolation from a male colleague. Theres humor in every beat of the story and the laughs come from the characters humanity not camp comedy. When theyre clingy or childish or guilty they see the humor in their situation and in themselves. When the threats to their relationship take a serious turn the peril feels earned. ""The Five-Year Engagement"" is vastly more ambitious than -- and superior to -- the star-stuffed romantic ensemble comedies that shtickmeister Garry Marshall has been turning out. Its chockablock with inventive humor and sharply drawn secondary characters (the strong cast includes Kevin Hart Alison Brie and Chris Pratt) yet it feels as if stretches are unfolding in real time. By going big director Nicholas Stoller (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"") aims to make the film larger and deeper. At times its just longer.

But even with a lower laugh count big flaws and a more ambling pace ""Engagement"" is notable. Its worth a look -- at a bargain matinee price that is. Its more of a treat for San Franciscans as the City by the Bays iconic landmarks -- the Palace of Fine Arts the Golden Gate Bridge and of course those photogenic cable cars -- are carted out for travelogue effect. Certainly those familiar with the city will laugh at the numerous lapses in geographic logic and Hollywoods insistence that parking exists at a flick of a turn signal on city streets. Good luck with that.But I digress as does this movie. Starring two of todays most likable presences -- Segel and Emily Blunt (""The Devil Wears Prada"") -- ""Engagement"" takes a stab at romantic comedy conventions and draws enough new blood to keep us engaged.Advertisement Guiding the effort are Segel who co- wrote and Stoller who cowrote directs and produces. Together they prove to be masters of the uncomfortable comedy -- the kind in which we identify with the hilarious foibles of very real characters then squirm in our seats as the humor ventures into darker territories.They put lovebirds Tom (Segel) an up-and-coming chef and Violet (Blunt) a social psychology postdoctoral candidate through the wringer though ultimately too much so for the story to handle.They also take off the rom-com rose-colored glasses to reflect a love that can turn out to be cruel. If youre looking for cheap sentiment throughout see ""The Lucky One"" instead.At the films start life is lovey-dovey for Tom and Violet. Soon after Tom cutely pops the question things fall apart thanks to a string of unexpected events. A rushed wedding between Violets quirky sister Suzie (""Communitys"" Alison Brie) and Toms crass chef buddy Alex (a scene-stealing Chris Pratt of ""Parks and Recreation"") along with a postdoc gig for Violet at the University of Michigan put engagement plans on ice. Their move to Michigan chills their relationship with Tom quietly sacrificing his career so Violet can pursue her academic dream. After a long search Tom lands an unfulfilling job at a deli while Violet lands the affections of her erudite professor (Rhys Ifans).In classic Apatow fashion ""Engagement"" is messy and meanders with some situations playing out more sharply than others. A gag about a ""faculty spouses"" (Chris Parnell) predilection for knitting and hunting grows tiresome. In contrast an intense argument in bed between Tom and Violet is painfully authentic and written to perfection.Often enough Apatow and company nail the scenes although they throw way too many obstacles in the couples path. Its one thing to play with romantic conventions its another to make them so complicated that it cuts off the relationships air supply.Segel and Blunt are game though and meet every challenge. Segel is not only a first-rate comedian but a darn good actor. Ditto for the charming Blunt whos won raves for diverse roles in indie films ranging from ""Young Victoria"" to ""Salmon Fishing in the Yemen"" but is still searching for that great lead role to truly capitalize on her diverse talents. Together they elevate the imperfect ""Engagement"" into something worth a look. Lets hope they are granted another chance to walk down the cinematic aisle together.The FIVE-Year Engagement   1/2Rating R (sexual content and language throughout)Cast Jason Segel Emily Blunt Rhys Ifans Chris Pratt Alison BrieDirector Nicholas StollerRunning time 2 hours4 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Review Five-Year Engagement - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Five-Year Engagement Engaging rom-com worth an I do  1/2 Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips picks 10 movies you should look forward to this summer. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune A lot of terrible romantic comedies come along in a given year and after five or six you begin to question your belief in anything -- romance comedy movies even terribleness itself. Before you know it youre trying to break the fever and hit bottom deliberately with repeated viewings of films co-starring either Katherine Heigl or Gerard Butler or worse their near-lethal joint effort the Yugo of rom-coms ""The Ugly Truth.""So. When something as sharp and funny as""The Five-Year Engagement""comes along it means something. I really like this film loose flaps protracted finale and all. As in last years""Bridesmaids""an authentic dimensional human element animates the jokes and the characters with whom we spend a couple of highly satisfying hours. Jason Segel lately muppeting around in ""The Muppets""co-wrote the script with director Nicholas Stoller his ""Muppets"" partner who also directed Segel in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" The movie begins where others typically wrap it up. San Francisco chef Tom Solomon (Segel) proposes to Violet Barnes played by the fabulous Emily Blunt. Shes angling on doctoral studies in social psychology at the University of California Berkeley. But when the call comes its from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.Plans are adjusted. Tom gives up his shot at running the kitchen in a fancy new Bay Area bistro to relocate with Violet to Ann Arbor where after a deceptively quick job-hunting sequence he finds work at the finest deli between the coasts Zingermans which is a real place (and what a place) and a presence as crucial as any in the formidable ""Five-Year Engagement"" ensemble. Tom and Violet hear their wedding bells but fate and their own doubts conspire to keep them off in the distance. While they postpone their marriage for one reason and then another Toms best friend and fellow chef Alex (Chris Pratt) hooks up with Violets sister Suzie (Alison Brie). Theirs seems like a haphazard coupling with no future but before long they have a child on the way leaving Tom and Violet in the dust Facebook update-wise.""This is your wedding"" Suzie tells Violet before the first postponement. ""You only get a few of those"" The punch lines clever but its not delivered for an imaginary laugh track. Stollers film proceeds with a blithe confidence. In outline form ""The Five-Year Engagement"" goes by the numbers. The script creates useful supporting cliques for both major characters. Violets psych-study group led by her subtly wolfish professor (Rhys Ifans) is a prime group of eccentrics including Mindy Kaling as a researcher of considerable undermining skills. Tom falls in with the Zingermans pickle expert (Brian Posehn) and improbably discovers deer hunting with another ""faculty husband"" a mild-mannered fellow played by Chris Parnell.Shooting in San Francisco and Ann Arbor cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe (whos worked with Pedro Almodovar) lends ""The Five-Year Engagement"" a lovely sheen far easier on the eye than any previous Judd Apatow-produced comedy. The narrative formulas arent exactly new; they wouldnt be formulas if they were. But one scene in particular seals our investment in the story. Its a late-night argument following a dicey encounter between Violet and her mentor and the way Blunt and Segel build the scene it feels utterly true (without sacrificing the funny). Segel and Blunt are enormously likable people on screen armed with wide-eyed charm and stealthy timing. When the relationship at the movies heart threatens to erode from within you feel for both halves equally. And by the end you realize how seldom this happens in this most devalued of genres.mjphillipstribune.comThe Five-Year Engagement -- 3 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for sexual content and language throughout)Running time 204Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Lifestyle and Leisure Movies The Five-Year Engagement (movie) Fishing Chris Pratt The Muppets (movie) Diane Keaton and Kevin Kline cant save messy Darling Companion  1/2 With The Pirates Band of Misfits the treasures in the details The Raven Once upon a drama dreary  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0424-five-year-engagement-20120426,0,5506041.column",200,thefive-yearengagement31,thefive-yearengagement,chicagotribune

What happens to two people who are meant to be together after theyve found each other? Thats the searching funny-sad question posed by The Five-Year Engagement a lively original and scattershot-hilarious ramble of a Judd Apatow production. From the moment we meet them theres no doubt that Tom played by Jason Segel (he of the empathetic smirk) and Violet played by Emily Blunt (who gives off the most gorgeous British glow since Julie Christie) are very much in love. On top of that they appreciate the good fortune that brought them together on a fateful New Years Eve. The two live in San Francisco where hes a sous-chef on the rise in a food-crazy town and shes an academic psychologist dreaming of a job at Berkeley. Well thats one dream that isnt meant to happen. Shortly after the two get engaged Berkeley turns her down. Then an alternate offer arrives a two-year research position at the University of Michigan. Its Violets best shot at an academic career so she feels she has to take it. And Tom an enlightened post-feminist fully supports the plan. Except that when the couple move to Michigan it turns out that his job opportunities are less than zero. The best he can come up with is making scrumptious sandwiches at Zingermans a beloved deli run by slacker foodies led by a self-declared ""pickle nerd"" (Brian Posehn). The Five-Year Engagement was directed by Nicholas Stoller from a script he co-wrote with Segel and like their earlier Apatow collaboration Forgetting Sarah Marshall the movie has a shaggy unpredictable structure that works for it. It only pretends in fact to be about a couple who have to postpone their wedding plans year after year. Yes thats the basic outline but Tom and Violet despite their up-in-the-air circumstances could easily tie the knot. The real issue is that marriage wouldnt begin to solve their problem -- which is that Tom his career in a dead zone loses his purpose his mojo his joyful manhood. He keeps dreaming of the head-chef job he could have had at Clam Bar a San Francisco hot spot that gave the gig to his doofus buddy Alex (the scene-stealing Chris Pratt whos like Jack Black in Seann William Scotts body). Tom starts to hang with a fellow faculty husband (Chris Parnell) who takes him on hunting trips and in between shooting at deer he grows an ugly Midwestern beard in a style that might be described as Ted Nugent-meets-clinical depression. The more he sinks into his funk the woollier and funnier the movie gets. The comedy even turns violent with gory incidents involving a crossbow and a lost toe. You have to accept a basic contrivance thats built into the The Five-Year Engagement In what is meant to be a thriving college town couldnt a chef with Toms skills find a cooking gig a little further up on the food chain? Couldnt he at least try to open his own restaurant -- as he says he dreams of doing? Since (full disclosure) I happen to be a native of Ann Arbor the noted U of M college town where most of The Five-Year Engagement was shot I may be a bit biased. But I couldnt help but feel its a little strange that Tom and Violets new hometown which they never once refer to by name (they just talk about living in ""Michigan"" as if it were some wintry hick wilderness) doesnt appear to have so much as a single high-end restaurant. (I will vouch however for the films highly accurate portrayal of the tastiness of Zingermans.) Yet once you go with its premise the movie is an enjoyable grab bag of messy life circumstances. Tom and Violet drift love fight disengage do pillow-talk therapy -- and thats all before Tom goes off the deep end. Meanwhile the movie like so many Apatow productions finds an antic redemption in the spirit of the group -- Toms co-workers and also Violets highly amusing team of postdoc psychology colleagues who each have at least one screw loose. (That goes as well for her department head a very smooth lech played with impeccable timing by Rhys Ifans.) The Five-Year Engagement isnt a comedy about falling in love. Its a comedy about falling from love and grasping your way back to happily ever after. B+ Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As a writer producer and director Judd Apatow is cinemas most prolific and consistent purveyor of what Quentin Tarantino calls ""hang-out movies"" films with characters so relatable and entertaining that audiences want to revisit them like beloved friends. The new Jason Segel-co-written Apatow-produced romantic comedy The Five-Year Engagement is an unusually pure hang-out movie. Like its protagonists its in no hurry to get down to business unless the business in question is luxuriating in the camaraderie and ebullient good humor of an unusually likeable group of friends and associates played by a band of ringers that includes Mindy Kaling Kevin Hart Brian Posehn Alison Brie Chris Pratt Chris Parnell and Rhys Ifans in addition to the perfectly matched perfectly cast leads Segel and Emily Blunt. The Five-Year Engagements purposefully meandering plot finds the wedding of inveterate charmers Segel and Blunt perpetually delayed due to the demands of Blunts career in academia. The happy couple gets uprooted from San Francisco to Ann Arbor when Blunt is accepted into graduate school at the University of Michigan. The initially game indulgent Segel grows increasingly resentful when circumstances force him to put his own professional aspirations aside to support Blunts thriving career. Segel sinks into a prolonged funk and adopts a hirsute mountain-man persona after he takes up hunting and bonds with a house-husband (a very funny Parnell) whos equally devoted to killing and eating large animals and knitting. Meanwhile Blunt becomes close with a charismatic mentor (Ifans) who takes a more-than-professional interest in his gorgeous effervescent protege. As co-writer and star Segel is a generous leader. Hes happy to cede attention and big laughs to his co-stars even when Pratt as Segels boyish best friend threatens to steal the film with an inspired variation on Segels adorable goofball persona. Director/co-writer Nicholas Stoller (Segels writing partner on The Muppets and director on Forgetting Sarah Marshall) only really begins to show the comedys 124-minute length in a slightly wobbly oddly paced third act that in time-tested romantic-comedy tradition separates its lovers for reasons that sometimes feel organic and earned and sometimes feel like screenwriter contrivances. Given its title and premise its poetically apt that The Five-Year Engagement is a lovely sweet funny romantic and supremely worthwhile endeavor that unfortunately takes longer to wrap up than it should.

The Five-Year Engagement Fair Director Nicholas Stoller. Cast Jason Segel Emily Blunt Chris Pratt. Rating R for sexual content and langauge throughout. Similarly you dont have to be a movie expert to know that ""The Five-Year Engagement"" is too long. Some things you can just tell. Hotlist Nine wedding movies Nicholas Stoller directs and re-teams with Jason Segel on the script -- the pair worked together on the superior ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" In another Judd Apatow production they try to mine a similar vein -- call it the profane romantic comedy. But here the story drags on too long and its not as inspired to begin with. Segel stars as Tom half of the couple who cant seal the deal and Emily Blunt plays Violet his fiancee. Segel is a warm-and-fuzzy presence in everything hes in and Blunt is delightful. Some bits are funny some vulgar some sweet. But come on. Make an honest woman of her already. Tom and Violet live in San Francisco where he is a sous chef in a nice restaurant. They are a couple from the first time we see them; on the anniversary of their nowhere-but-in-movies adorable initial meeting on New Years Eve a year before -- he was dressed as a pink bunny and she as Princess Diana -- Tom proposes and Violet accepts. So far so good; five minutes in and we have an accepted offer. And then life intrudes. At the party announcing their engagement Toms best friend Alex (Chris Pratt) has a one-night stand with Violets sister Suzie (Alison Brie). She gets pregnant they get married and we have our first obstacle to Tom and Violets nuptials. There will be many more. The biggest occurs when Violet is accepted at graduate school at the University of Michigan which will push back the wedding at least two more years. Despite working at the job he loves Tom leaves behind the possibility of running his own kitchen and heads off to Ann Arbor with Violet. He finds work in a sandwich shop. She finds contentment in her studies and a mentor of sorts in Winton Childs (Rhys Ifans) one of her professors. Hmm. Fair enough but Tom is more miserable than he lets on -- one of his only friends is Bill (Chris Parnell) the husband of a student. Bill looks after the kids knits sweaters and teaches Tom to hunt. That leads to a rather bizarre development in which Tom goes all Grizzly Adams growing scary-looking facial hair keeping bees making mead and generally acting depressed. But no matter how Stoller and Segel try to disguise it this is still a romantic comedy and thus must follow the established rules of such things. So the relationship must wax and wane with predictable developments delaying the wedding even further. There are some unpredictable developments as well -- amputation ranks high among them about which no more need be said. Its never clear why they cant just go ahead and get married; presumably Tom could be just as miserable in Michigan with a wedding band on his finger. It would have addressed at least some of the problems that come up. Plus it would have made the movie shorter -- a win-win. But no. On it goes the engagement the movie everything. Unfortunately stretching things out dilutes the charms of Segel and Blunt which are considerable. Its as if in their eagerness to throw in scene after scene Stoller and Segel forget the two words that would have tidied things up sooner and thus made the film more enjoyable.

"Review `Five-Year Engagement feels about as long - Boston.com Afraid of the Dark | The Frights Listen Live Boston.com HomeTodays GlobeNewsYour TownBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal Estate Movies Restaurants Music Theater/Art Television Celebrity news Events Comics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Review `Five-Year Engagement feels about as long By Christy Lemire AP Movie Critic / April 24 2012 E-mail| Print| Text size - + E-mail E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. The problem that plagues so many Judd Apatow productions -- the one that keeps good comedies from being great ones -- unfortunately exists in ""The Five-Year Engagement"" too. Its a matter of knowing when to say when of knowing which bits should be trimmed and which should have been cut altogether.""The Five-Year Engagement"" is so scattered and overlong it really feels like it lasts five years and even the inherent likability of stars Jason Segel and Emily Blunt cant overcome the films pervasive sense of strain. It becomes so tortured it almost gets to the point where you hope these two will break up for good just because its the pragmatic thing to do and because it would finally wrap things up.And thats a shame because the movie reunites Segel with Nicholas Stoller; the two also co-wrote 2008s ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" one of the more well-balanced Apatow productions with Stoller once again directing and Segel starring as the doughy everyman. (Stoller also wrote and directed ""Get Him to the Greek"" which was hilarious but also overstayed its welcome just a tad.)Like ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" ""The Five Year Engagement"" touches on themes of love found and lost in a serious way and to its credit it does find some moments of emotional truth amid the inconsistent laughs. But man it can be a messy slog to get to them.It begins promisingly enough though. Segels Tom Solomon a sous chef at an upscale San Francisco restaurant proposes to his girlfriend Blunts Violet Barnes on the one-year anniversary of the night they met New Years Eve. (Flashbacks to their meet-cute are incorporated in amusing ways.) Blunt and Segel have an easy low-key way with each other in these early scenes that never rises to full-scale crackling chemistry.But as theyre planning their wedding Violet gets accepted to the University of Michigan to study for her doctorate in psychology so they postpone their big day for the first of many times. Seasons change years pass and Tom isnt nearly so enamored of snowy Ann Arbor as he pretended to be at the beginning. Meanwhile Violet is asked to stay and do post-doctorate work so theyre stuck in marital limbo even longer than expected. Tom continues trudging away at a deli that is totally beneath his culinary expertise while Violet works even more closely with her intriguing Welsh professor (Rhys Ifans whos very good here in an unusually dialed-down role).Additionally Violets sister (Alison Brie) has gotten pregnant from a drunken romp with Toms loutish best friend (Chris Pratt) and the resulting pregnancy -- and wedding and baby -- supposedly serve as further obstacles to Violet and Toms nuptials.This all sounds like a drag right? Thats probably because it is. Halfway through you want to yell at the screen for them to run off to Las Vegas and just get it over with already; then again it becomes increasingly difficult to root for them to stay together when they seem to be headed down such divergent paths.Stoller and Segel try to liven things up with wacky gags and oddball supporting characters including Toms profane boss (Brian Posehn) whos obsessed with pickling things; Toms only friend (Chris Parnell) a university spouse who knits sloppy sweaters and teaches him to hunt deer; and Ming (Randall Park) one of Violets research partners who has wild ideas for experiments that are never funny.One character slices off part of a finger. Another loses a toe. And on it rambles.The movie finally finds some much-needed whimsy at the absolute end -- but by then its too late.""The Five-Year Engagement"" a Universal Pictures release is rated R for sexual content and language throughout.

No sooner have the two lovebirds announced their nuptials than a career opportunity for the would-be bride forces a relocation from the Bay Area to Minnesota. Wedding plans are put on indefinite hold; as the years go on resentments build up emotional funk gives way to god-awful facial hair and arguments become increasingly nasty. Can these two overcome the obstacles put before them? And exactly how many misfiring jokes about pantsless males can a film make? Like a mug of chamomile tea spiked with a dropper of cheap vodka Nicholas Stollers relationship-roller-coaster comedy has hints that something stronger and slightly edgier might lie beneath its smooth surface Characters lace casual conversations with conspicuously creative cock references (did you know cold weather will give you ""baby dick""?) drunken sex may involve being hard-slapped with deli meats and just because youre in a rom-com doesnt mean you cant lose a toe to frostbite. But dont be fooled by the foulmouthery This is the same old safe sappy movie that shows up on TBS every weekend the kind that would never let a few gratuitous dirty lines of dialogue or ""frank"" moments keep it from lulling viewers with platitudes about the power of love. What this wilting wobbly look at premarital pitfalls really signals however is that the Apatow raunch-com model may have run its course. The bearded producers touch is all over this from the mix of sweet and salty elements to giving the second bananas more moments to shine than the leads (congratulations Parks and Recreations Chris Pratt; you officially steal the movie). But whereas Stoller and Segel did wonders with the formula in 2008s Forgetting Sarah Marshall a certain overfamiliarity creeps in long before the going gets rough. Combine that with outright laziness about using the filmmaking to complement the funny--would it kill people to construct a scene that doesnt just arbitrarily cut away after a punch line?--and the fact that relying on Segel and Blunts ample charms alone simply isnt enough to carry an unnecessarily long winding story line and the sense of deflation soon becomes overwhelming. There are two love affairs that are in danger of falling to pieces here and only one of them is on the screen.

Tom (Jason Segel who co-scripted with Stoller) a sous-chef at an upscale eatery in San Francisco tells his butch boss (Lauren Weedman) that hes quitting to move to Ann Arbor where his fiancee Violet (Emily Blunt) has just been accepted to do postdoc research at the University of Michigan. The head chef snorts at what a bad decision Tom is making in the name of coupled commitment before dropping the bomb ""This is why I voted against gay marriage. Please dont tell anyone I said so.""A gay persons (or any persons) anti-knot-tying stance--as an actual principle not commitment-phobic skittishness invariably cured in the final act--tied up with the wish to keep that belief closeted would make for a great romantic comedy. But those complicated emotions have no place in The Five-Year Engagement a film as comfy as the bunny costume Tom wears at the New Years Eve party where he first meets Violet. The movie opens on their one-year anniversary the night Tom proposes. They postpone the wedding so that they can get settled in Michigan an adjustment period that involves lame gags with snow and ice and the lack of classy restos worthy of Toms skills . While he makes Reubens at Zingermans deli Violet thrives under the academic mentorship of Welsh charmer Winton (Rhys Ifans). When her postdoc is extended Toms deepening misery at being stuck in the Wolverine State takes the form of extravagant facial hair and an obsession with deer meat; the downward spiral continues culminating in extracurricular drunken kisses an amputated big toe and the couples decision to call it quits.With about 45 minutes to fill before the preordained conclusion The Five-Year Engagement introduces one amusing minor character Audrey (Dakota Johnson) a decade-younger hostess whom Tom starts dating--and who erupts into ageist invective when he delivers news that she doesnt want to hear. Some of that fire might have made dully cheerful Violet a more memorable creation; her most outlandish act is to quietly suggest to Tom ""Maybe its OK for me to be selfish."" Shes an improvement over the vindictive shrew Kristen Bell played in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) Segel and Stollers first collaboration--which like this film was also produced by Judd Apatow--but Violet remains a strenuously anodyne character one that not even a performer as gracefully instinctual as Blunt can do much with.The loutish or regressed guy behavior that typifies Apatow productions has also calcified into the innocuous. Toms male friends with their pillowy carbed-out bodies are devoted doofus dads who giggle over naughty wordplay.Occasionally the dialogue in The Five-Year Engagement might sound like something an adult audience member has once thought or uttered. ""I wanna be alone with you here"" Tom pouts to Violet after theyve had a fight and she gets out of bed to respect his request for momentary solitude. This fleeting acknowledgment of the come-here-go-away dynamic of most romantic relationships serves as the films most insightful look at attachment at any cost. The rest is much like the doughnuts that Violet uses in a research experiment stale and not good for you.

Just the threat of a wedding seems enough to get romance-minded viewers hot and bothered which means Universals ""The Five-Year Engagement"" -- which sometimes feels more like ""The 25-Year Engagement"" -- is going to be escorted up the aisle by big numbers. Swinging haplessly between poignancy and vulgarity this overlong comedy reunites the ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" team of writer-star Jason Segel writer-helmer Nicholas Stoller and producer Judd Apatow. But more importantly it puts Emily Blunt in a wedding dress which will appease the hopeless romantics in the house even while making the institution of marriage seem ridiculously obsolete. The films central crisis such as it is is the failure of Tom Solomon (Segel) and Violet Barnes (Blunt) to find the right time to have a wedding. Hes the sous chef at a top-flight San Francisco restaurant; shes a psychology student looking for a doctoral program. When they first met a year earlier -- the flashbacks are done as predictably gauzy-yet-absurdist memory plays -- they clicked hard. Now Tom nervously botching the very theatrical proposal hed planned asks Violet to marry him and she says yes. Its by-the-numbers boy-gets-girl stuff. But then Violets sister Suzie (Alison Brie) gets pregnant by Toms co-worker and the movies resident idiot Alex (Chris Pratt) and their resulting wedding (and baby) push Tom and Violets plans out of the way. Soon Violet gets accepted into a prestigious two-year graduate program at the U. of Michigan. Tom the sort of sweetie-bordering-on-sap in which Segel seems to specialize agrees to quit his job and go with her to the Midwest where even the locals laugh at him for leaving San Fran. (The Pure Michigan campaign is not going to take this well.) The usual Apatow comedy themes are touched upon Men have problems with women. Men have problems with their egos maturity self-definition and self-reliance. (Tom cant find a job and ends up at a hippie sandwich shop which allows Stoller to deploy his secret weapon Brian Posehn in the role of Toms slightly deranged co-worker.) Things are taken too far such as the vulgarities dropped regularly and incongruously into the dialogue. If a joke works once its done at least twice. Theres a ridiculous sequence in which the increasingly depressed Tom who fears hell never get out of Michigan takes to hunting smoking venison keeping bees and brewing mead. Long before any of this however its clear that the question of weddings is completely irrelevant. Had ""The Five-Year Engagement"" been made 40 years ago it would have had a cogent if not exactly hilarious joke a loving couple thwarted by fate from ever being together. But here they already are together They live together they sleep together they share a destiny. Their lives are already intertwined emotionally spiritually and practically. So theres nothing really at stake except a ceremony and consequently theres no tension to the story. Building a movie around a wedding whether or whenever it actually takes place is of course a sound commercial move as Universals Apatow-produced hit ""Bridesmaids"" attests. But its not enough to sustain a comedy by itself and while Segel and Blunt make likable enough leads the strain is visible as the filmmakers try to make comedic hay out of disconnected segments contrived situations and tangential characters. (Chris Parnell as stay-at-home dad Bill gives Tom a horrifying look at what his life might become.) The pic cant seem to integrate conflict with comedy; when matters between Tom and Violet are grim thats generally how they stay. The acrimony between some of the characters isnt at all amusing and the nastier the attempts at humor the less effective they are. Its only in the final minutes that ""The Five-Year Engagement"" starts to come together in an extremely funny and charming Muppets-inspired moment. But its a little late to be thinking how one might indeed like to get to know the characters better just as theyre saying goodbye. Production values are topnotch and Van Morrison fans will be won over by the score.

NEW YORK -- A warm-hearted look at what happens when a storybook romance hits a speed bump The Five-Year Engagement originates with a pre-mythologized meet-cute and ends with Hollywood whimsy but insists on making the hurdles between as little like rom-com contrivance as the filmmakers can get away with. Much more successful than Stollers solo outing Get Him to the Greek this latest collaboration for director Nicholas Stoller and co-screenwriter/star Jason Segel never hits the peaks of laughter Forgetting Sarah Marshall achieved but will please the teams fans while -- no penises here -- appealing to a more conservative crowd as well. PHOTOS The Muppets Premiere Red Carpet Arrivals Segel and Emily Blunt play Tom and Violet who met at a New Years costume party (he dressed as a bunny as if the big lug werent cuddly enough) and were smitten by midnight. We hear the story multiple times as they tell it to themselves and others but when we meet them theyre already in the real world -- where elaborately constructed wedding proposals fall apart and if theyre not careful a happy couples engagement party might be upstaged by romance among the celebrants. Their wedding is postponed when Violet gets a postdoc job in Michigan forcing a two-year relocation from lovely San Francisco where Tom had been in line for a prestigious head-chef gig. Although willing to take one for the team Tom suffers in the icy Midwest devolving into a careerless mountain man just a step removed from another pathetic ""faculty spouse"" played by Chris Parnell. Meanwhile Toms old cooking pal Alex (Chris Pratt) set up by the script as a culinary Falstaff becomes a family man. Pratt who steals his first scenes and promises more fun to come trades his dunce cap for fatherhood and leaves Segel hanging -- a scenario that will ring true for many men of a certain age in the audience. As Tom falls into a rabbit hole Violet grows more engaged with colleagues -- Mindy Kaling is underused here but Rhys Ifans as the groups charismatic leader is perfectly cast. Like producer Judd Apatows own Funny People Engagement isnt afraid of running longer than viewers expect of a romantic comedy. But unlike that (underrated) film no one can accuse Engagement of jumping narrative horses midstream Stoller and Segel make the audience feel the grind of this pause in the couples plans. They keep the comic vibe afloat with occasional false-start wedding attempts but by the time the Michigan stay is extended the trouble this couple is in bears little resemblance to the usual rom-com hiccups. The Five-Year Engagement winds up promoting a romantic ideal that while still wrapped in Hollywoods ribbons feels a bit more like something viewers might see in their own lives -- whether theyre lucky enough to have their first kiss accompanied by New Years fireworks or not.
