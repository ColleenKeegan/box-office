Mongol warriors led by Genghis Khan charge into battle on horses in Mongol. Photo ALEXANDER ZABRIN PICTUREHOUSE Mongol 1 / 1 Back to Gallery EVERY few scenes someone in Sergei Bodrovs exhilarating Russian-Kazakh co-production explains what it means to be a Mongol. Mongols dont kill women and children. Mongols fear the thunder because they know the god Tengri is angry. Mongols dont make war over a woman. Mongols dont spill blood at a resting place. Most of all Mongols dont break customs or ""the world will turn upside down."" As fate or Tengri would have it that last bit is spoken on the cusp of just such a world-flipping turn of events. The Khan Esugai (Ba Sen) accepting a bowl of milk from sworn enemies at a resting spot quaffs it and later topples off his horse. ""Youll be Khan now"" he tells his young son Temudjin (Odnyam Odsuren) but the conniving servant Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov) has other plans. He dumps Esugais body loots his yurt and proclaims himself Khan. As for the kid Targutai decides to hold him captive until hes old enough to kill. Theres just one itty-bitty problem The boy grows up to be Genghis Khan. We know that; Targutai doesnt. Eight hundred years of hindsight tell us that the notorious 12th- and early 13th-century nomad went on to subjugate a fifth of the worlds land mass but Bodrovs film only takes us part way -- to the beginnings of the Mongol Empire. Writer-director Bodrov (who co-wrote the script with Arif Aliyev) has been coy about the possibility of a sequel. Maybe hell make one maybe he wont. Even standing alone Mongol is a thoroughly rousing hunk of celluloid a war saga that blends the sturdiest conventions of old-fashioned heroic storytelling with a few pixilated battle enhancements -- check out the soaring blood globs -- of the kind that spattered across 300. As with Nomad a 2005 Kazakh war epic that Bodrov co-directed with Ivan Passer it is not overlong. You might even call it overshort. Years get clipped segues get dropped and narrative continuity occasionally suffers. Yet all the archetypes are here The destined child; the fearful prophesies; the warring brothers; the call of true love. Nominated for a foreign-film Oscar earlier this year Mongol is as much concerned with the inviolable bond between Temudjin (played as an adult by Tadanobu Asano) and his wife Borte (Khulan Chuluun) as it is with the strength of his sword. And it plays up the paradoxes of Genghis Khan a bloody conqueror who united Mongol tribes established a rule of law and accepted as his son a child likely fathered by the man who kidnapped Borte. I leave it for historians to quibble through details. But it makes for a damned good story. The all-Asian casts acquits itself brilliantly; this is a far cry from John Wayne in full Mongolian facepaint for The Conqueror. As Temudjin Asano projects grace and unshakable self-possession. As Borte Chuluun is a fine-boned beacon of strength. But the killer performance is Honglei Sun as Temudjins blood brother Jamukha whose explosive laugh and flamboyant ego infuse the film with an almost modern vibe. Before this I had never heard throat-singing slurred by drunks around a campfire but such are the diversions of Mongol. In more sober moments those otherworldly tones appear on Tuomas Kantelinens uncanny and impassioned score -- which echos over the forbidding vistas of the steppe breathtakingly evoked in Rogier Stoffers and Sergei Trofimovs cinematography. Mountains loom. Deserts stretch. The ghost of David Lean haunts the landscape. Mongol is not a perfect film. I wish it were. I especially wish Bodrov had airbrushed into oblivion all those footprints in the snow left behind -- wild guess -- during earlier takes. I also would have preferred an explanation for Temudjins facial scars during a key sequence and their miraculous erasure later on. But these are minor irritations in a stirring and majestic film -- a work that dramatizes romanticizes heroizes and humanizes one of historys towering figures. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Columbia Mens/Womens Vent Cush Flip Sandals for 15 + free...

Mongol (R)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Mongol (R)  A Russian director gives face to Mongolias mythical leader. Photo Picturehouse Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald Do not scorn a weak cub reads a proverb at the start of Mongol. ``He may become a brutal tiger. Genghis Khan of course is more than brutal; he will eat tigers for breakfast. The legendary 13th century conqueror who controlled a fifth of the world at the height of his power has been the protagonist of two previous Hollywood films. In one he was played by John Wayne; in the other Omar Sharif. Neither film is remembered today for good reason. Directed by the Russian Sergei Bodrov (Prisoner of the Mountains) Mongol -- which features an all-Asian cast and was nominated for the Best Foreign Film Oscar this year -- is a much more lasting work doing justice to a man rivaled only by Alexander the Great in terms of mythical stature. Oliver Stone tried encapsulating Alexanders life into one movie only to discover the task was impossible. Bodrov knows better using Mongol -- the first of an intended trilogy -- to center on Genghis Khans formative years when he still went by the name Temudgin and had not yet led Mongolias warring tribes and factions to consolidate into a formidable whole. Beginning with his boyhood Mongol depicts Temudgin as a proud defiant indomitable warrior (charismatically played by the Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano) and doting husband to his wife Borte (Khula Chulunn). Or at least as doting as time allows since he is frequently busy leading armies into bloody battle rotting away in dank prisons or avoiding assassins arrows and swords. Bodrov who has shot the film in widescreen format with the thunder and fury of an old-school Hollywood epic is not interested in a historically precise recounting of Temudgins life. Less-than-honorable incidents (such as the childhood murder of his half-brother) are conveniently omitted and God himself (in the form of a wolf) intervenes in the action not once but twice to save Temudgin from a certain death. Only in Temudgins growing rivalry with his brother Jamukha (the excellent Honglei Sun) an equally charismatic and dangerous warrior does Mongol really strike any dramatic complexity. The rest of the film is as black-and-white as a western edging too closely to hagiography to be taken seriously as a work of historical fiction. But the battle sequences are tremendous and the performances are captivating making for the sort of rousing giant-scale entertainment that a figure as towering as Genghis Khan deserves.

Directed by Sergei Bodrov. With Tadanobu Asano Honglei Sun and Khulan Chuluun. In Mongolian with English subtitles. (Rated R. 124 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Mongol"" has a classic tagline - ""Greatness comes to those who take it"" - thats right on the money for a sweeping old-school epic. In recounting the early life of Genghis Khan this outsized film offers everything you would want from an imposing historical drama furious battles between mass armies unquenchable love between husband and wife blood brothers who become deadly enemies and many episodes of betrayal and treachery among the warring tribes of the Central Asian steppes. This is a large-scale production of the David Lean school but nudged in an art-house direction by Russian filmmaker Sergei Bodrov (""Prisoner of the Mountains""). There are plenty of haunting landscapes gorgeously photographed by Sergei Trofimov on location in China Kazakhstan and Mongolia along with the sort of warfare scenes that define epics but also an unexpected take on one of historys most fearsome leaders. The man who becomes Genghis Khan isnt exactly portrayed as a humanist or an egalitarian but as a leader who was unusually fair-minded and generous for his day. We meet the future Genghis as a 9-year-old named Temudgin the son of a tribal chieftain who expects the boy to choose a future bride for political reasons. Instead Temudgin picks a brash girl they encounter during their journey a defiance his father accepts with surprising calm. The girl is Borte and she will remain a key figure throughout the movie. On the way home Temudgins father is killed by a rival who violates Mongol traditions of hospitality robbing the boy of his patrimony and making him a fugitive. This long opening is a distillation of whats to come with its focus on the hardness of nomadic life the role of custom and the frequency of its abuse Temudgins resilience and strong will the endlessness of tribal intrigue and conflict and the mercilessness of the eras warfare. Temudgin will undergo experiences that transform him into a fierce leader and a wise man. Borte is abducted and Temudgin suffers a long and cruel imprisonment. He becomes the blood brother of Jamukha a prince who comes to his rescue early in life and who will later help him rescue Borte before the men become enemies. Temudgins affection for Borte is an amazing thing to the proud and ambitious Jamukha because Mongols never go to war over a woman. The leads are nicely played by a multinational cast headed by Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano (of the 2003 ""Zatoichi"" remake) as the taciturn but potent Temudgin. Chinas Honglei Sun brings fierceness and even a touch of humor to Jamukha and Khulan Chuluun a Mongolian nonprofessional plays Borte as a woman strong enough to be fought over. As enjoyable as all this is you start to feel that Bodrov may have a case of galloping hero-worship. It would be wrong to press the point too hard since facts about Genghis Khans boyhood are scant but at certain points it seems that the filmmakers in creating an alternative to the monstrous Genghis of the schoolbooks have gone too far in the opposite direction. Another quibble The religious scenes in which Temudgin retreats to a sacred spot to fortify his spirits seem cursory as if Bodrov decided the film needed a shot of instant Kurosawa. You cant introduce a subject like Mongol animistic beliefs and just touch on it in passing. But in general the film is so impressive that we cant leave the theater without wanting more. And with luck (and decent box office returns) well get it - ""Mongol"" is projected as the first film in a trilogy about Genghis Khan. -- Advisory Graphic sequences of bloody warfare.

The landscape of Mongolia is as much a character as the actors in the historical saga ""Mongol"" a heroic portrait of Genghis Khans rise to power. The film shot in far-flung parts of China Mongolia and Kazakhstan catches the vast wilderness of the former Mongol empire with breathtaking clarity. In this land where borders are meaningless a man could have immense dreams. Russian director Sergei Bodrov gives us both an action epic and a sweeping romance. The tale begins when Genghis is a 9-year-old named Temudjin (Odnyam Odsuren) dutiful son of tribal leader Esugei (Ba Sen). Esugei intends to betroth his son to a daughter of the Merkit tribe creating a blood alliance between the groups. Along the way Temudjin meets Borte (Bayertsetseg Erdenebat) a girl headstrong enough to question him without being introduced. Impressed he chooses her for his bride-to-be despite her tribes marginal importance. Esugei allows the boy his choice then dies mysteriously and when a power-hungry tribesman takes control Temudjin flees for his life. Years pass and Temudjin (now played by Tadanobu Asano) does marry Borte (Khulan Chuluun). The offended Merkits kidnap her and Temudjin rides to her rescue with his blood brother --and eventual rival -- Jamukha (Honglei Sun). After numerous reversals escapes betrayal and revenge Temudjin and Jamukha turn against each other each leading a giant army. Is this true? Does it matter? Records of the conquerors life are scarce and often conflicting but ""Mongol"" provides an authentic-looking glimpse at the culture and customs hardships and tribal rivalries of life in central Asia 1000 years ago. The love story between Temudjin and Borte gives a dramatic context to the factionalism that fueled his eventual mission to unite the Mongol people. The point of the film is to carry us away with thundering battle scenes and soaring emotions. The film succeeds on those counts with grandiose battle scenes that send arterial blood squirting skyward like handfuls of rubies and lovers reunions guaranteed to put a lump in the hardiest of throats. In the lulls -- the film is deliberately paced -- Bodrov sketches Temudjins political and spiritual maturing an evolution that depended a great deal on the cunning guidance and support of Borte. This is a kinder gentler Genghis a devoted husband and soulful leader who understood that commanding men requires generosity as well as discipline. ""Mongol"" is the first film of a proposed trilogy that charts his conquest of half the known world. If the sequels match this one they cant come soon enough. MONGOL  out of 4 stars Rating R for sequences of bloody warfare. In Mongol with English subtitles. Theater Uptown.

In Mongol Russian director Sergei Bodrov shoots the amazing landscapes of Inner Mongolia and Kazakhstan the way John Ford turned Monument Valley into a stage for some of moviedoms most magnificent westerns. An Eastern western and a historical epic of epic proportions Mongol traces the rise of Genghis Khan from nomadic boy prince to warrior leader. Rife with bloody battles galloping steeds and the beautiful faces of a cast of professional and novice actors hailing from Central Asia China and Japan the film - set between 1172 and 1206 - is a wide-screen wonder that is not surprisingly fierce and violent. More surprising though are its moments of whimsy magic and romance even. And accurately or not Bodrov presents his hero not as a brutal vanquisher a tyrant bent on domination but as an intelligent resilient fighter thoughtful of his minions and destined to rule. It is fate more than megalomania that drives him to unite the tribal territories of Mongolia and take on the world. And as portrayed by Odnyam Odsuren (as a boy) and Japanese pop star Asano Tadanobu (as a man) hes even sort of a nice guy. Mongol begins with a flashback to our hero Temudgin as a preternaturally watchful 9-year-old traveling the steppes with his father Esugei a tribal leader. They stop at a Merkit encampment - there is history here between Temudgins father and the Merkit elders and peace to be brokered. As a way to fix the rift Esugei has brought his son to choose a wife among the Merkits and so the boy inspects a lineup of the tribes girls stopping at Borte (Bayartsetseg Erdenebat) a mischievous-looking 10-year-old. Its a rich scene this kid sizing up the (often taller) young ladies assembled for his perusal. And then he locks eyes with Borte. Right then and there they decide to marry - wedding date in five years. Theres no going back to boyhood fun though for Temudgin. In short order his father is poisoned his mother is in tears the camp where they lived is looted run asunder. Mongol tracks Temudgins adventures and hardships - his imprisonment his solitary years his bond of friendship with a tribal prince his reunion with the beautiful Borte (now played by Khulan Chuluun) his enslavement his freedom. The first part of what director Bodrov promises to be a trilogy tracing the life of the historic conqueror Mongol is great cinema great fun. Mongol 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Sergei Bodrov.

Forget the ruthless conqueror of much of the known 12th- and 13th-century world. As the beautifully made Mongol tells it Temudjin as the young Khan is known in the film endured hardship and rose to incredible power thanks to the love of a good woman. That would be Brte (Khulan Chuluun) whom Temudjin (Tadanobu Asano) chooses as his bride while still a boy - a decision that eventually leads to war. But first Temudjin will suffer the loss of his father followed by all manner of poor fortune. ""Do not scorn a weak cub; he may become a brutal tiger"" the screen reads at the beginning of the movie and for Temudjin those are words to live by. The film a foreign-language Oscar nominee is epic in scope in scale in story in everything. It has as much action as any brain-dead Hollywood blockbuster but Mongol also has heart and intelligence. (Whether it has historical accuracy greater minds will have to debate.) The future Khan is progressive at least in the movies version. Hes willing to eschew the traditions of his people to do what he thinks is right particularly when it comes to Brte. When shes captured by his enemies he enlists the help of his blood brother and eventual adversary Jamukha (Honglei Sun) who reminds him that a Mongol does not go to war over a woman. Temudjin does. And with Jamukhas help he prevails at least for the time being. He also accepts the child Brte is pregnant with as his own. (This is not the last time it will happen; Brte too has a rough run of luck.) Although his relationship with Brte drives Temudjin its his relationship with Jamukha that drives the film. Jamukha like Temudjin is a natural leader but thats where the similarity ends. The impulsive Jamukha is as showy as the patient calculating Temudjin is reserved. Despite their great love and respect for each other a confrontation is inevitable; both seem to accept it as their destiny. The battles like everything else in the movie are huge affairs with plenty of detailed slow-motion bloodletting. Jamukha finds strength in numbers Temudjin in strategy. At one point during the climactic battle when one of Temudjins tactics bears fruit you practically want to cheer at the simplicity and effectiveness of it. Temudjins life is about honor something he believes in so strongly that he has no problem enforcing it upon others. (One popular improvement he makes actually sharing the spoils of pillaging and plundering with his troops.) Its when he seeks the help of the gods while gathering strength and numbers for a battle that we see the only glimpse of the Genghis Khan of lore The Mongol people need laws he says and he will enforce them even if means killing half of them. Asano and Chuluun are both good each bringing a low-key determination to their roles. But Sun is outstanding. His Jamukha is savage and somehow modern. Laughing at adversity with the self-assurance of someone who trusts that hes more powerful than any person place or thing is reminiscent of a present-day superstar athlete politician actor or musician. Can anything in the universe lay them low? Need we even ask? Suns portrayal notwithstanding theres an old-fashioned feel to Mongol a patience and grandeur not seen much anymore. It trusts its audience to soak in the enormous breadth of the story the beauty of the settings without rushing to the next battle scene. Mongol is the first installment of a planned trilogy.

Centered on the rise of Genghis Khan the film is an enthralling tale in the style of a David Lean saga with similarly gorgeous cinematography. It combines a sprawling adventure saga with romance family drama and riveting action sequences. The film has a visceral energy with powerful battle sequences and also scenes of striking and serene physical beauty. Its only flaw there might have been one battle too many. Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano is impressive and haunting playing Khan as both a fearless warrior and a feeling human being. He is not played as a barbarian as much as he is an inspiring visionary and yes ruthless leader driven by commitment to his people and his family. We see the early fire in the conquerors youthful years and watch as he is imprisoned tortured and endures to become a man who conquered a huge swath of the world. We also see that he was sustained by his lifelong love Borte (Khulan Chuluun) a strong and spirited woman who was his trusted advisor. Director Sergei Bodrov (Prisoner of the Mountains) illuminates Khans life in a multi-dimensional way and his re-creation of the bleak and expansive beauty of Mongolia in the 12th and 13th centuries is arresting. Mongol is quality escapism an exotic saga that compels moves and envelops us with its grand and captivating story.

Much of it though is an inspired hilarious mess. The organizing idea -- the disorganized organizing idea -- combines Jewish James Bond webless Spider-Man and gross-out ""Shampoo."" Adam Sandlers Zohan is an Israeli counter-terrorist operative who despite his superpowers wants to be a hair stylist and make the world silky smooth. Why? Dont ask. Or ask but the answer is why not since Mr. Sandler and his co-writers Robert Smigel and Judd Apatow havent written a silky-smooth script so much as concocted a lumpy hummus of antic notions. On paper the movie must have looked invitingly idiotic. On screen it looks crazed but the comic energy is huge if indiscriminate and Mr. Sandlers performance -- think Topol doing Charles Boyer -- can be as delicate as it is gleefully vulgar or grotesque. In Israel the heros nemesis is a Palestinian terrorist the Phantom whos played by John Turturro. (The Phantom and Jesus Mr. Turturros character in ""The Big Lebowski"" could bowl on the same team.) In New York where Zohan reinvents himself as a hairdresser named Scrappy Coco he gets entry-level work in a beauty parlor owned by a lovely Palestinian -- shes played by Emmanuelle Chriqui -- but theres no rest for the combat-weary; soon hes fighting Arab terrorists anew. (The New York neighborhood with Arabs on one side of the street and Jews on the other recalls the fast-food rivalry of the Oscar-winning short ""West Bank Story."") The script serves in its scatter-shot way as a parable of endless conflict between Arabs and Jews. Yet the political parody seldom catches fire and the story stops dead in its crabwise tracks for some frantic nonsense in which a greedy landlord turns predatory developer and Mariah Carey plays herself with agonizing difficulty. ""Zohan"" which was directed by Dennis Dugan rises to its subject most reliably by aiming low -- though not so low as the dim sequence in which Zohan smuggles himself into America in the cargo hold of a jet in the company of two shaggy dogs. Mr. Sandler is at his best when Zohan sporting a pizza-size star of David is using kung fu moves to tie people (literally) in knots; strutting his stuff like a demented John Travolta; scaring a spoiled brat in the highest tradition of W.C. Fields (""When I was your age Id already killed seven men -- maybe you should grow up"") or seducing elderly patrons of his salon. When Zohan goes beyond seducing them the movie goes beyond the pale but thats not to say it isnt appallingly funny. Mongol If the Genghis Khan of ""Mongol"" were running for president hed give Hillary Obama or McCain a gallop for their money. Sergei Bodrovs thrilling steppe epic upgrades the brutal head of those bloodthirsty hordes to the status of visionary. This Mongol of all Mongols is a modern merciful leader ahead of his time -- 800 years ahead of his time. Hes so cool and self-contained in his sense of personal destiny that its no wonder scads of nomads follow him. The director who wrote the script with Arif Aliyef might have called it ""Temudgin"" though that doesnt quite sing as a selling title. Genghis Khan was born with that name in 1162 and Temudgins emergence from boyhood into full and fearless manhood is the subject of the movie the first part of a projected trilogy. The production was Kazakhstans entry for a best-foreign-film Oscar in the most recent Academy Awards but its a huge and hugely impressive international enterprise. Mr. Bodrov is the Russian filmmaker best known to American audiences for the superb 1997 drama ""Prisoner of the Mountain."" The adult Temudgin is played -- with remarkable intensity -- by the Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano. Honglei Sun whos Chinese is the heros blood brother and mortal enemy the mercurial funny and frightening Jamukha. Temudgins wife a beautiful woman named Borte is played by the movies only Mongolian star Khulan Chuluunn and its her first time in front of a camera. Shes a great argument for native talent and against acting classes. I dont know the Mongolian word for panache but ""Mongols"" got plenty of it. The battle scenes are as notable for their clarity as their intensity; we can follow the strategies get a sense of whos losing and whos winning. The physical production is sumptuous. (The film was shot by Sergey Trofimov who is Russian and Rogier Stoffers who is Dutch.) And through all of Temudgins extravagant trials and hard-won triumphs theres a sense of a singular child serving as father to a powerful man whose power flows from his instinctive devotion to justice and to his wife. Its an austere epic that turns the stuff of pulp adventure into a persuasive take on ancient history. Kung Fu Panda In a more mundane world than the beautiful mythical China of ""Kung Fu Panda"" the roly poly hero Po voiced by the rolyer poly Jack Black would be a candidate for Overeaters Anonymous -- he cant lay off the carbs. In the world of animated features the team responsible for this script might qualify for Underwriters Anonymous and thats no knock on the insurance industry. Most of the characters are as sketchy as the production design is inventive luminous and elegant. The essence of the film is slapsticky chopsocky action rendered with great verve and accompanied by bromides having to do with the need to believe. Po needs all the help he can get. The clumsy son of a goose who runs a noodle shop -- I dont believe the movie ever explains why a panda should have been sired by a goose -- he has dreamed of being a kung fu master. But this corpulent Asian cousin of Pooh Bear has little more than his dreams going for him when he is suddenly chosen as the Dragon Warrior -- I dont believe the movie makes much of a case for that choice either -- and expected to defend his village against a villain who has escaped from a prison with 1000 guards. (The abundance of talent on the voice track includes Dustin Hoffman Angelina Jolie Jackie Chan and Randall Duk Kim.) ""Kung Fu Panda"" begins with a promise of edgy wit. ""Legend tells"" a smarmy narrator intones ""of a legendary warrior whose life was legend."" But the film soon settles into a succession of ritual spoofs of the kung fu genre and peddles the sort of cloying preachments about self-esteem and human potential -- panda potential -- that little kids hear all the time on TV. There is Pos master says no secret ingredient theres only you and your special gifts. To make something special you just have to believe its special. Yadda yadda yadda. To make a movie special its not enough to have brilliant animation. You have to believe in telling good stories. When Did You Last See Your Father? When Did You Last See Your Father?"" is an eloquent and affecting evocation of a man who remains bigger than life even as he approaches death. Its adapted from the well-known book of the same name by the English poet Blake Morrison who published his memoir in 1993 after his father had died. (Anand Tucker directed from a script by David Nicholls.) The father Arthur Morrison is played by the inimitable Jim Broadbent. The son played by Colin Firth has a lifetime of hurts to come to terms with his fathers minor duplicities major philanderings and volcanic magnetic narcissism. ""How did you put up with it?"" Blake asks his mother. (Shes played mutedly by Juliet Stevenson who is only four years older than Mr. Firth.) The answer is not easily. For mother and son alike it has taken the pain of watching him die to be able to love him for who hes been. DVD Tip In its theme Tim Burtons ""Big Fish"" (2003) strongly resembles ""When Did You Last See Your Father?"" Albert Finney is the father Edward Bloom and Billy Crudup is Will the estranged son who comes home to see the old man who is dying. But Mr. Burton fills the screen with surreal stories that Edward has told about himself. Part of Wills task is to reach an understanding that his father was to a great extent the sum total of the stories he told.

"Mongol More to Khan than wrath | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsMongol More to Khan than wrath The greatest achievement of Mongol  an impressive first chapter to a planned film trilogy on the life of Genghis Khan is separating the life from the laugh track.Russian filmmaker Sergei Bodrovs beautifully lensed historic epic the first of a planned trilogy stars Tadanobu Asano as Genghis Khan.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 6 2008 Mongol (out of 4)Starring Tadanobu Asano Khulan Chuluun and Honglei Sun. Directed by Sergei Bodrov. 120 minutes. At the Varsity. 14A The greatest achievement of Mongol an impressive first chapter to a planned film trilogy on the life of Genghis Khan is separating the life from the laugh track.Khans name registers in Asia as an ancient warrior of skill and vision but elsewhere hes often reduced to a punch line for bad jokes about corporate chicanery.Russian filmmaker Sergei Bodrov has long wanted to bring Khans life and legend to the screen both as homage and image restoration. His dedication extends to the visual. Mongol was shot on the same Central Asian plains in China and Kazakhstan that Khan and his Mongol followers roamed in the 12th and 13th centuries. Theres an aura of authenticity about this picture that makes up for the few lapses in narrative. Even if you cant completely follow the plot you also cant take your eyes off the scenery the thrilling horse chases and the throat-slashing battles. Mongol has Hollywood verve with a distinctly non-Hollywood cast many of whom are non-professional actors.It begins with Khan as a 9-year-old in 1172 known then as Temudgin being taken by his father to choose a bride from the rival Merkit tribe. In a gesture indicative of the youths singular determination he instead chooses a girl named Borte whom he meets on the way.Tribal tensions violently conspire against happiness. Temudgins family is torn by tragedy and he grows to become a hunted man (played by Japans Tadanobu Asano) who is constantly at risk of enslavement. He finds an ally and blood brother in the like-minded Jamukha (Chinas Honglei Sun) a warrior of strength and good humour. But even there loyalties fray and violence erupts.Temudgins brief reunions with Borte (Mongolias Khulan Chuluun) are the source of both joy and dread since both know that death could come at any time. Credit goes to Chuluun for making her mark in a movie that is overwhelmingly macho.A portrait emerges of Mongol of a warrior slow to anger and quick to forgive but ruthless in punishing friends and eliminating foes when humbler options fail. He has a personal philosophy that isnt so far removed from all those bad jokes after all.""Mongols need laws"" he says. ""I will make them obey even if I have to kill half of them.""The movie ends with Temudgin officially taking the name Genghis Khan.

"Mongol reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Mongol reviewed. Mongol reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 6 2008 1137 AM This Mongolian Life An old-fashioned epic about Genghis Khan. By Dana Stevens Odnyam Odsuren in Mongol When Westerners think of Genghis Khan we tend to focus on the whole raping-and-pillaging thing. But in the imagination of many Asians the 13th-century Mongol warrior who united the nomadic tribes of Central Asia and eventually ruled over one-fifth of the Earths land mass occupies a position not unlike that of Alexander the Great an enigmatic figure a merciless conqueror who was also beloved by his people as a just ruler. In short Genghis Khan is the ideal subject for either an epic poem or a summer action franchise. Now he has both The Secret History of the Mongols an anonymous poem composed shortly after Khans death in 1227 and Sergei Bodrovs Mongol (Picturehouse Films) a Russian-Kazakh co-production largely based on that poem and the first film in a projected trilogy on the life of the storied warrior. The occasional CGI-enhanced battle scene notwithstanding this is a historical epic like Mom--or David Lean--used to make. Its got transgenerational blood feuds galloping steeds lucky talismans carried for years by separated lovers and steppes--lots and lots of steppes. The movie was shot on location in Kazakhstan and Inner Mongolia (a province of China) and aside from the otherworldly beauty of the landscape itself (still one of the most isolated spots on Earth) theres something thrilling about how this drama unfolds on the very ground where Genghis Khan ruled. Advertisement Genghis Khan was not a proper name but a title (""universal ruler"") that was eventually bestowed on the man born as Temudgin the son of a tribal chieftain. As the movie begins Temudgins father (Ba Sen) is taking his 9-year-old son (Odnyam Odsuren) to choose his future bride from an enemy tribe. Instead Temudgin himself chooses a 10-year-old girl named Borte (Bayartsetseg Erdenebat) who will eventually become the love of his life. On the way back from their betrothal the father is poisoned by yet another rival tribe whose leader vows to kill Temudgin when he grows up (the taboo on killing children apparently being one of the few ethical limits respected by medieval Mongols). So Temudgin embarks on a life marked by constant danger shifting alliances kidnappings and counter-kidnappings and the occasional stint in shackles. These painful vicissitudes do a lot to account for why Temudgin might grow up to be played by Tadanobu Asano a Japanese actor model singer and hipster idol best known in the States for his role as a samurai in Takeshi Kitanos Zatoichi. As Genghis-Khan-to-be Asano projects a preternatural self-possession rarely raising his voice above a low mumble. But that very stillness makes him more formidable. Though Asano is a shade delicately built for a great warrior hes more than convincing as a man with the resolve to conquer the world. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Asano owns the movie but two other actors stand out the Chinese Honglei Sun as Jamukha Temudgins blood brother and eventual sworn enemy; and the Mongolian Khulan Chuluun as his wife Borte whom Temudgin loves enough to break with the Mongol tradition of never waging war over a woman. The glimpses we get into such customs are fascinating and I could have done with one less slo-mo battle sequence and a few more details about nomadic burial practices but Mongol isnt a lesson in cultural anthropology-- its a conventional epic biopic with a handsome international cast and a high level of technical finish. My only problem with Mongol is that--how often in life do you get to write this sentence?--Genghis Khan is a little too nice. As hes tenderly cradling his wifes pregnant belly (pregnant possibly with the child of her enemy captor) or reassuring his soldiers that no really they should divide the plunder amongst themselves youve got to wonder Dont you have to crush more people on your way up the ladder of world domination? Mongol ends abruptly in 1206 as Temudgin is named leader of all the Mongol tribes. Presumably as his power expands in future movies well come to see more of the dark side of the man who would be Khan. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

This biography of the young Genghis Khan presents a warlord so chatty and flirtatious that he might as well have been called Genghis Hanks. As a young boy the headstrong lad picks out his future bride (actually she picks him) from a random tribe instead of a politically powerful group but on the plus side he picks up a promise to win a sable coat as a dowry. Cha-ching Later with his father dead and a pretender usurping the title of khan young Temudgin (the future Genghis) vows vengeance - then essentially tells his men to hold that thought. He has to go look up this girl he hung out with for about 10 minutes several years ago. The conquesting is shunted mostly to the side as Temudgin takes breaks to chat about for instance how beautiful the Mongol language is - to put the kindest possible spin on it it sounds a bit like a goat spitting up his lunch - or about where to put which yurt. Meanwhile his enemies keep capturing - but forgetting to kill - him. The story starts to turn from the wrath of Khan to the wrath of audience when locked in prison Temudgin sits there like a lost poodle at the pet shelter waiting to be rescued instead of busting out. A movie with dialogue like ""I didnt know that day would change my life forever"" and ""Dont you want to touch me Temudgin?"" needs a bit more action. When Khan finally builds his one-man force into an entire army and a battle plan he does so off-screen between scenes because the film is more interested in showing him picnicking with his kids. Director Sergei Bodrov stages a couple of splattery yet artful battle scenes - including one in which a gang of ruffians wears what look like cool hockey masks covered with graffiti - and there is a weird and jittery score reminiscent of the one in ""There Will Be Blood."" Even so ""Mongol"" really isnt worth leaving your yurt for. MONGOL Borelord.In Mongolian with subtitles. Running time 124 minutes. Rated R (war violence). At the Sunshine the Lincoln Plaza.

Thursday June 5 2008 546 PM OPERATION FILMMAKER3 starsDocumentary about the clash between an Iraqi student and his American benefactors. At IFC (130). Unrated Language disturbing images. You can bet Nina Davenport didnt set out to make a documentary as bracingly honest as the one she ended up with. Her intention was to chronicle what was thought to be the typically inspiring tale of Muthana Mohmed a young Iraqi student ""saved"" by well-meaning Americans like Liev Schreiber and the Rock. But instead of inspiration we get reality as Muthana turns out to feel less grateful and more entitled. Is he a victim of the Americans self-conscious charity? Or a hustler taking advantage of it? Davenport herself seems stunned by how complicated the story turns out to be which just makes her movie all the more worthwhile. Elizabeth Weitzman MONGOL3 starsEpic about the early life of the conqueror Genghis Khan. At Landmark Sunshine and Lincoln Plaza (205). In Mongolian with subtitles. R Battle violence. The founder of historys greatest contiguous empire gets an appropriately bravehearted movie an exciting actioner from Russian director Sergei Bodrov. Introduced as a 9-year-old young Temujin - wholl grow up to be the ruler Genghis Khan - picks his young bride but soon sees his chieftain father poisoned by a rival clan and his lineage ignored. Facing down adversaries and acquiring allies Temujin later winds up imprisoned escaping to battle his turncoat friend Jamukha. Filmed in Mongolia the movie has slight reverb from Hollywood bio-epics (Temujin and his brides bond through adversity makes Bill and Hillary Clinton look like amateurs) but is filled with gripping battle scenes. And every performer is tough and charismatic especially Honglei Sun who as Jamukha gives so many neck-cracks guttural howls and conspiratorial smiles hes like a Chinese Marlon Brando. Joe Neumaier THE MOTHER OF TEARS 1 starHorror thriller about a reborn witchs curse. At the Empire 25 and Sunshine Cinema (138). Unrated Bloody violence nudity. Italian horror fans may get fired up over veteran Dario Argentos final chapter in his ""Three Mothers"" trilogy but much of this spooky-spirits-in-Rome chiller is by the numbers. Asia Argento the directors daughter is an archeology student running from an occult prophecy after - of course - an ancient urn is dug up. Soon demons are lurking churches are burning random acts of violence erupt and burgundy-wood-panel libraries seem ominous. At 67 maestro Argentos taste still runs toward bloody entrails and eye-gougings but Asias sexy sour-lemon smile is underused in his movies. Not much makes sense here but if a goth chick gang acting rude in an airport doesnt sound scary to you then the baboon in the museum will certainly be a letdown. J.N.

By Peter Rainer June 7 2008 Save for later Saved Finally a movie that restores the good-guy reputation of Genghis Khan Youve been waiting for this one I know.Actually as revisionist epics go ""Mongol"" is often startlingly good. It has epic power and plenty of big battles but director Sergei Bodrov also has a feeling for the small intimate moments in the life of Genghis Khan - or to be precise Temudgin his birth name. Temudgin doesnt sound as scary as Genghis Khan though.We first meet up with Temudgin at age 9 in 1172 as he accompanies his tribal chief father Esugei (Ba Sen) across the steppes. There are lots of steppes to climb in ""Mongol"" and theyre real not computer-generated. (Bodrov filmed in remote locations in Mongolia China and - apologies to Borat - Kazakhstan). Nothing if not precocious Temudgin picks out a bride en route 10-year-old Borte who also has eyes for him. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? He must wait five years for the marriage ceremony however. As he says goodbye to Borte he gives her a wishbone as a token of his dedication. This wishbone goes in for much heavy-duty symbolism in ""Mongol"" which strenuously attempts to paint Temudgin (played as an adult by the Japanese actor Tadanobu Asano) as a one-woman guy even though as a matter of historical record he had hundreds of wives. But Borte (Khulan Chuluun) was clearly his main squeeze and shes so striking that she looks as if she could model the latest parka wear in Paris. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Mongol As Temudgin ascends to his rightful place in the warrior-o-sphere he endures captivity and worse. The rival tribal chieftain who swore to kill the boy when he came of age - nice of him to wait - kidnaps Borte and ends up ganged up on by Temudgin and his blood-brother buddy Jamukha (the marvelous Yul Brynner-ish Honglei Sun) who cant understand why anyone would wage a war over a woman. Jamukha is fond of saying things like ""For Mongol horse is more important than woman.""Its only a matter of time before Temudgin and Jamukha square off. (You half expect them to say ""This tundras not big enough for the both of us."") Its all very classical - best friends become best enemies. But since Bodrov has such a sweeping magisterial vision the face-off seems fated rather than hokey. Thats true of just everything in ""Mongol"" which at times resembles a David Lean epic with frostbite. It even has a marvelous score by the Finnish composer Tuomas Kantelinen that utilizes what sounds like incantatory chants.Thanks to Hollywood the historical epic genre has long had a reputation for being shmaltzy and star-driven and nowadays bleary with CGI effects. ""Mongol"" is a throwback to a more respectable tradition. The largeness of its scope arises naturally from the material not the budget. The movie earns its stature.Im not sure Im comfortable with the notion of Genghis Khan as a benevolent hero though. On the other hand do we really want to go back to the days of Jack Palance and Omar Sharif as Mongol mongrels? Grade A- (Rated R for sequences of bloody warfare.)

A child--a boy--has a parent killed and an enemy vowed before manhood. His lifelong quest for vengeance brings him to glory though he stirs up a dozen more betrayers and if hes lucky a great love. The details change horses are swapped for tanks swords for guns. But we always like our conquers to be kicked around before cracking skulls. Mongolias grand entry into the epic territory that was recently plundered by Nomad about Kazakhstans Mansur and Indias Jodhaa Akbar which trumpeted Akbar the Great boasts a bigger name than both Genghis Khan. Or as hes known here Temudjin (Tadanobu Asano) whose fight to avenge his father (Ba Sen) and reclaim his feisty bride Borte (Khulan Chuluun) steels him to conquer damn near everywhere by the ending credits. Like most historical portraits of great but polarizing men director Sergei Bodrov and his co-writer Arif Aliyev have made 1190s most famous man nicer and duller--a dignified slave who believes in true love (or at least a woman with strong legs and narrow eyes the better to resist evil spirits). Genghis is famous for powerful armies and powerful sperm; even today 8% of Mongolians have traces of him in their DNA. Its a sly joke that the two kids Borte bears him in the film are likely not his just the faultless scions of a wild west plains culture that swaps women like war stories. Lacking great themes and inner depth Mongol is just another galloping wondershow of ice blue skies and rocky plains a light diversion with delusions of grandeur that seems harmless until you realize youve just watched a thousand men stabbed by spears.

He fends off enemies avenges his fathers death and finds true love (and family) with pugnacious bride Borte before being kidnapped by slave-trading adversaries and unleashing the world-conquering warlord within.Despite some necessary embellishment Sergei Bodrovs expansive biopic hews close to the established facts painting a vividly accurate portrait of life in this unforgiving region you can smell the yurts and yak dung. The widescreen landscape photography is often ravishing grey sky and green grass blurring in soft washes of misty morning pallor as sunlight creeps across the steppes. But the screenplays insistence on depicting only the first two decades of the Khans life handicaps the narrative. Theres precious little action before the final frustratingly truncated battle sequence which begins well with epic shots of massed horsemen thundering across the screen but becomes somewhat farcical when weather stops play just as things are getting interesting (it turns out all Mongol warriors are terrified of thunder).Theres also scant effort made to get inside the head of this ruthless leader were asked to like Temudgin to respect him as warrior friend and family man but our understanding of his motivation remains sketchy. These tribesmen are a taciturn lot measurable only by their actions which tend to the extreme.  Still Mongol remains a gracefully mounted stunningly photographed historical account fascinating in its attention to detail if somewhat unengaging in its story and characters.

Genghis Khan is one of them. For long Im wondering how this human being famous for being called one of the greates conqueror in the history become that famous. And for years Im thinking that he must be a barbarian. But from this movie ( if its really been done carefully with research ) I see the different side of The great Khan. This movie brings the human side of this greatest warrior. I fee relieved after knowing this movie is not in English..nice to really feel it just like its in MONGOLIA. Also feel glad to see Bronte is not picture as overly beautiful like normally what Hollywoord made. She is still a typical mongolian face which is good. This movie has made me as if Im travelling to Mongolian desser and savannah. Although I was expecting more of the scene where Genghis Khan is conquering 1/4 part of the world...I will say Im not dissapointed in waching this movie. At least now I can imagine a figure for years I assume as a warrior with no mercy like barbarian and kind of immortal be able to rules like that. Indeed...he is also pictured well as an ordinary kid at first. Although it cant be said this is a perfect movie. But I think there should more movies like this. So that people are more related to history. Been visualised in a movie history will looks more interesting. Last but not least I think the director and the crews needs an applause for the long hard work. Must be not easy to make such a movie like that interesting with no wellknown cast except Tadanobu Asano ( Temudjin) and the famous chinese actor Sun Honglei ( Jamukha) who played the old Zhang Zi Yis son in her 1st debut movie The Road Home. I expect the sequel of it...perhaps trilogy. The 1st will talk about his early years amp; how he became the great Khan the 2nd Im expecting more scene of him as a conqueror...3rd..his son..and his grandson Kubhilai Khan continue his legay. Am I asking too much? Overal...I like this movie.

I still cannot decipher how this and beaufort got nominated for best oscars as they were both obviously flawed and if they describe the human condition today or in any era then god alone can help humanity. I am very sceptical that any God even Tengri [mongol thunder god]presented as a white siberian wolf can achieve that miracle . The mongols triumphed for one reason alone they could ride their horses with an alacrity and skill which made them faster than thunder they took their opponents by surprise as they could eat sleep and even shoot an arrow with precision from the horsebackthis movie misses those targets by a wide margin and though it is good cinema worth watchingits not even near to the genius it represents . Bordov and Arif need a better script if they are planning a sequel and definitely a better cast. The previous attempt in the sixties with Omar SHARIF seems to have been an inspiration for this silly if somewhat surreally beautiful adventure with some stunning images and a mysytical and mysterious monk who can cast accurate prophesy about the khan but not himselfwhich is where this movie stumbles between the wide chiasm of reality and ancient mythology . usman khawajaFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 11 2008usman khawajaFeaturedSPEED SINS AND SEXUAL SKILLS -Mongols resuurected their nation under a great genius Genghis khan almost 9 centuries ago but this is a superstitious myth which tries to please the japanese and chinese audience into shelling out the fee for a ticket .

I still cannot decipher how this and beaufort got nominated for best oscars as they were both obviously flawed and if they describe the human condition today or in any era then god alone can help humanity. I am very sceptical that any God even Tengri [mongol thunder god]presented as a white siberian wolf can achieve that miracle . The mongols triumphed for one reason alone they could ride their horses with an alacrity and skill which made them faster than thunder they took their opponents by surprise as they could eat sleep and even shoot an arrow with precision from the horsebackthis movie misses those targets by a wide margin and though it is good cinema worth watchingits not even near to the genius it represents . Bordov and Arif need a better script if they are planning a sequel and definitely a better cast. The previous attempt in the sixties with Omar SHARIF seems to have been an inspiration for this silly if somewhat surreally beautiful adventure with some stunning images and a mysytical and mysterious monk who can cast accurate prophesy about the khan but not himselfwhich is where this movie stumbles between the wide chiasm of reality and ancient mythology . usman khawajaFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 7 2008SigFeaturedI was expecting a Hollywood visual pap so was pleasantly surprised to find it beautifully filmed with sub-titles. The review here is being a little unfair as it stands above what comes out of the USA machine. The battle scenes were more like 300 in fur with Sin City blood overlays.

Encompassing shifting tribal alliances a love story for the ages and a sworn friendship transformed into enmity ""Mongol"" traces the formative years of legendary warrior Genghis Khan. Spanning his life from age 9 in 1172 through 1206 when the feuding nomadic clans united under his leadership this Central Asia-set historical epic from Russian helmer Sergei Bodrov (""Nomad"") boasts breathtaking landscapes dazzling cinematography bloody battles and unique traditions. The beautifully mounted actioner the first entry in a proposed trilogy should conquer auds in the khans former territories and with savvy marketing may also draw new blood to the film when Picturehouse releases it Stateside next year. Shot on locations in Kazakhstan and the Chinese province of Inner Mongolia pic captures the nomadic lifestyle of the 12th century and the harsh climate and varying terrain of the Mongolian steppe a place where a mans not a man without a horse. It also introduces a strong resourceful female character Borte first wife and lifelong adviser to the man born as Temudgin. Opening in 1192 during one of many periods of captivity Temudgin suffered the story flashes back 20 years to show him as a lad (Odnyam Odsuren) with his father Esugei (Ba Sen) a tribal leader. On the way to choose a bride from the fierce Merkit clan the boy finds heart captured by spirited Borte (Bayartsetseg Erdenabat) and he selects her instead. Its a choice that changes Temudgins life forever. On the way home his father is poisoned and as soon as the funeral rites are complete resentful follower Targutai (Amadu Mamadakov) seizes power -- and the property of Temudgins family. Tradition prevents Targutai from spilling the boys blood until hes grown so Temudgin becomes a fugitive. Alone on the snow-covered steppe he meets tribal prince Jamukha (Amarbold Tuvinbayar) and the two become blood brothers. Eventually Temudgin is captured and escapes. When hes captured again in 1186 hes grown into a strong defiant man (Tadanobu Asano). After another escape Temudgin obtains a horse and sets off to claim Borte (Khulan Chuluun). Their brief tender idyll is interrupted by vengeance-seeking Merkits who kidnap Borte. With the help of blood brother Jamukha (Honglei Sun) Temudgin rescues Borte but later the blood brothers fall out and eventually end up at war with each other. Perfs by the multiethnic leads mesh well. Japanese indie idol Asano smolders as maverick Temudgin charismatic Chinese thesp Sun brings some welcome humor to the role of Jamukha and Mongolian non-pro Chuluun makes an adroit Borte. Theyre nicely supported by a roster of Mongolian thesps in bit parts and an accomplished group of Kazakh and Kyrgyz stunt riders. Vivid lensing by Sergey Trofimov and Rogier Stoffers lends needed momentum to the sprawling tale particularly during the horse-mounted chases and battle sequences. Spectacular production design by artist Dashi Namdakov and handsome folkloric costumes by Karin Lohr keep the pic easy on the eyes. Lush score by Tuomas Kantelinen is hauntingly supplemented with the ethno-folk stylings of Mongolian band Altan Urgan. According to the press notes pic was conceived as the first of three films designed to cover the entire lifetime of Genghis Khan.
