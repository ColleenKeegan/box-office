What a lousy year for long-delayed sequels It may not be a stink bomb of ""Zoolander 2"" proportions but in many ways ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Sword of Destiny"" feels like an even more cynical cash grab. Trading on the pedigree of Ang Lees 2000 Oscar winner but capturing none of its soulful poetry this martial-arts mediocrity has airborne warriors aplenty but remains a dispiritingly leaden affair with its mechanical storytelling purely functional action sequences and clunky English-language performances. The result has grossed a healthy 32 million in China so far and began its Stateside streaming release on Friday (while opening on about a dozen Imax screens) but regardless of how it fares exec producer Harvey Weinsteins latest dubious non-contribution to Asian cinema will add some quick coin but no luster to Netflixs library. The singular magic that made Lees film such a boundary-breaking triumph -- it won four Oscars and is still the highest-grossing foreign-language film in North America -- is nowhere to be found in a production that seems predicated entirely on cost-effectiveness and compromise. Although ""Sword of Destiny"" has similar roots in the Chinese novelist Wang Dulus ""Iron Crane"" pentalogy and features a return appearance by Michelle Yeoh as the wise and formidable fighter Yu Shu Lien its a work that feels dispiritingly cut off from its predecessor; not even the ascension to the directors chair of Yuen Wo-ping (the veteran action choreographer behind much of the original films kung fu wizardry) can ensure much in the way of visual or dramatic continuity. And thanks to the filmmakers decision to shoot in English (with dubbed versions playing in Chinese territories) and to shoot primarily in New Zealand with Grant Major (""The Lord of the Rings"") enlisted as production designer the result is a sequel often feels less Middle Kingdom than Middle-earth. To be sure there are discernible and perhaps deliberate Tolkien-esque touches in this story of a weapon as powerful corruptive and coveted in its own way as the One Ring. Eighteen years after the death of the great Wudan warrior Li Mu Bai (played by Chow Yun-fat in the original) his legendary blade the Green Destiny remains in the possession of the family of his old friend Sir Te. But when Shu Lien arrives at the Te estate she has an immediate premonition that the sword will once again fall into the wrong hands. Sure enough in a scene that recalls the awesome first action sequence in ""Crouching Tiger"" (but minus the awesome) a masked warrior breaks into the Te household and tries to steal the sword; hes quickly caught and exposed as Wei-fang (""Glees Harry Shum Jr.) a member of the deadly West Lotus clan and thus a servant of the fearsome if none-too-subtly named warlord Hades Dai (Jason Scott Lee). Something about Wei-fang leads Shu Lien to suspect hes not such a bad guy (as noted hes played by ""Glees"" Harry Shum Jr.) and so she has him imprisoned in a cage in the open courtyard. This leaves the young man free to carry on a love-hate flirtation with Snow Vase (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) an impetuous young warrior who has apprenticed herself to Shu Lien but who seems much more curious about Wei-fang than about achieving enlightenment through kung fu. Talented but undisciplined and clearly guarding some sort of deep dark secret Snow Vase clearly reminds Shu Lien of that hidden dragon Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi who wisely opted to stay hidden this time) which is hardly the only way ""Sword of Destiny"" plays like a feeble callback to the original. Lee our great chronicler of emotional repression in any epoch was fond of describing ""Crouching Tiger"" as Jane Austen with martial arts -- a playful elegant and entirely intuitive conceit that he honored by taking the time to lay the dramatic foundation at the outset. Taking exquisite care with the films many character- and dialogue-driven scenes he grounded his story within a rigid social order in which members of the warrior class were forbidden by duty and honor from acting on their desires. In that context the gravity-defying action scenes erupting with the force of stones rupturing a lakes placid surface were at once a reflection of -- and a departure from -- the characters repressed inner states. None of that has made it to the screen in ""Sword of Destiny"" and for better and for worse no attempt has even been made in that direction. As scripted by John Fusco (also the creator of Netflixs ""Marco Polo"") the movie immediately kicks off with a mountain ambush and a frenetic blur of combat that conveys no sense of wonderment or discovery. And with the exception of one late sequence beautifully filmed on the surface of a frozen pond at night Yuens action scenes throughout have an uninspired brusqueness with none of the original films sustained hand-to-hand intimacy or psychological depth. The big centerpiece -- which unfolds at an outdoor restaurant where the workers and the clientele alike engage in a violent melee -- announces the arrival of Silent Wolf (""Ip Man"" franchise star Donnie Yen) a powerful warrior who has an old score to settle with Hades and a possibly romantic attraction to renew with Shu Lien. There are still more twists and developments to come in the form of childhood flashbacks mistaken identities climactic skirmishes and two formidable female foes a warrior named Silver Dart Shi (Juju Chan) and a scary blind sorceress (Eugenia Yuan). But they never feel like anything more than complications needlessly cluttering up a drama that never makes a compelling case for its own existence. Two lifelines to the original ""Crouching Tiger"" remain. Yeoh has always been an actress of uncommon elegance and poise and her innate dignity inspires a flickering confidence in the material that it doesnt really deserve -- and also inevitably to offset your irritation that she agreed to do the film in the first place. And then there is the music which is credited to the composer Shigeru Umebayashi but is memorable only for those passages it retains from Tan Duns magnificent Oscar-winning original score. The viewers spirit briefly soars with recognition even when the movie comes crashing back to earth. Film Review Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Sword of DestinyReviewed online Pasadena Calif.

Stephen Dantes says March 6 2016 at 543 am Had I read this review before watching the movie I probably would have procrastinated watching. Now that I watched the movie and reading reviews after I understand why in the world of movie watchers/goers critics are as useless as the ticket stubs from the theatre - proof of purchase but not evidence of viewing or enjoyment. I find this movie to be great. I do recognize lots of room for improvement but I would choose to watch this movie again. I actually sat through the first movie after watching Sword of Destiny just to be reminded of how great the first was. But with every minute of watching the first movie I appreciated Sword of Destiny more. I think Wo-ping Yuen did a great job. And for people like me who dont depend on someone elses critique of a movie to determine their love of it I want to say well done. I respect your opinion Justin but respectfully disagree on some points. Reply meiray says February 28 2016 at 1158 pm Spot on review. Really nailed exactly how I felt about the entire enterprise. Reply Ronnie says February 28 2016 at 707 am I found the sequel underwhelming. Only a couple of the action sequences had real energy. The music score during the fights scenes in particular did not enhance but almost depleted the excitement that could have been.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Feb 27 2016 Culture You dont have to look much further beyond the title of Netflixs Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Sword of Destiny to see the first problem with the sequel to Ang Lees beloved 2000 martial-arts film. Sword of Destiny which arrives simultaneously in theaters and on Netflix this weekend feels in every way like a knock-off. Yes the film is fortunately directed by Yuen Woo-ping the legendary choreographer who worked on Lees original film and many other landmarks of the wuxia (Chinese martial-arts) genre. But rather than building on the foundation laid by Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon the new film chooses to replicate the exact same story beats of its predecessor while trying and failing to top its fight sequences with some ill-advised computer assistance.Related Story Hollywood and China In Figures This is only where the flaws begin. Even though Sword of Destiny was released in China first and is clearly geared toward a global audience its predominantly Chinese cast speaks English throughout as opposed to the Mandarin of the original. Michelle Yeoh was the only member of the original cast to return for the sequel playing the mournful Yu Shu Lien and still guarding the legendary ""Green Destiny"" sword that caused so much trouble 16 years ago. Shes surrounded with a new ensemble though you wouldnt know it from the plot Everyones after the sword and a romance plays out between two young rivals jousting to capture it. With all of the first films startling beauty and emotional subtlety lost even Sword of Destinys established stars look uninspired in their roles.The original films Chow Yun-fat Zhang Ziyi and Chang Chen have been replaced by a new grab bag of talent The Hong Kong action star Donnie Yen plays Silent Wolf a veteran warrior from Shu Liens past. The Glee cast member Harry Shum Jr. is Wei-Fang a young bandit after the sword to repay a debt to the gangster Hades (Jason Scott Lee). The newcomer Natasha Liu Bordizzo is Snow Vase a fighter under the tutelage of Shu Lien who becomes Wei-Fangs romantic rival. They do their best with John Fuscos limited script but Sword of Destiny isnt overly concerned with diving deep into its characters motivations. Everyone wants the sword everyones nursing some haunting secret or past misdeed that they explain in voice-over as yet another fight sequence plays out and every confrontation ends in an elaborate sword fight.Sword of Destiny replicates the exact same story beats of its predecessor.Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon was made along similar lines--lots of wire-work fight sequences structured around a fairly simple story--but it struck deeper emotional chords paralleling the story of two older masters who have achieved greatness at the cost of admitting their feelings for each other with two younger wilder figures linked by their own doomed romance. It was a landmark moment for Western audiences of course who had barely been exposed to the wuxia genre before Crouching Tigers success and ushered in wider appreciation for the form. But everything that made Lees film feel distinct is missing in the sequel.Sword of Destiny shot by Bryan Singers cinematographer Newton Thomas Siegel is occasionally beautiful Some fights take place against sweeping vistas of the Chinese countryside and one climactic battle plays out on a frozen lake. But these set pieces are frequently marred by unnecessary CGI embellishment--the last thing Yuen Woo-pings still-extraordinary choreography needs. Taken on their own the fights in Sword of Destiny are mostly top-notch even if theres little else in the story to elevate them beyond dazzling feats of athleticism.The question remains as to why this project exists. Netflixs approach to television has been a mix of fascinating creator-driven projects and cheap revivals of established brands so perhaps its film division will work along similar lines. After all last years Beasts of No Nation directed by Cary Fukunaga was a worthy and powerful exploration of the lives of child soldiers in Africa. Meanwhile Sword of Destiny trades entirely on the name of its forbear and everything about its execution down to the decision to shoot English-language dialogue feels artless.There is one similarity it shares with Beasts of No Nation however The biggest draw for Sword of Destiny is its visuals which makes it especially peculiar that its coming out on Netflix. Though it is getting a small cinematic release (about a dozen IMAX screens across the country) it will primarily be consumed at home since most theater chains refuse to screen a film that comes out simultaneously on a streaming network. Since the only way to really enjoy Sword of Destiny is to drink in the gorgeous scenery hopefully your TV has enough pixels. Otherwise youd be better suited kicking back on the couch and reliving the brilliance of the original Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon instead.

But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace.

We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Thanks to its epic sense of romantic yearning and exhilarating wire-work fight sequences Ang Lees east-meets-west Hong Kong import became the top-grossing foreign film of all time - a title it still holds by the way. Now a decade and a half later comes the long-awaited sequel Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Sword of Destiny (available now on Netflix) a follow-up that might have played better if it didnt take so long to get here. Michelle Yeoh returns as the noble warrior Yu Shu Lien the sole connection in the cast to the 2000 original. Shes still a badass but shes now living in solitude like a ""forgotten ghost"" mourning the death of her beloved Li Mu Bai (played by Chow Yun-Fat in first film). Its a time of warring clans and Yeoh travels through dangerous lands brimming with assassins to pay her respects to the late Li Mu Bais family. While there a thief from the deadly West Lotus clan attempts to steal her fallen beloveds infamous sword the Green Destiny. As in the first Crouching Tiger this masked burglar tiptoes as weightlessly as Fred Astaire across the terra cotta rooftops. And even after 15 long years the gravity-defying wizardry of wire-work master Yuen Woo-Ping (the wu-xia fight choreographer in the original promoted to director here) takes your breath away. Its a shame the rest of the soap-opera story doesnt measure up to its stunts. With Yeohs help a beautiful young woman named Snow Vase (Natasha Liu Bordizzo) captures the handsome thief (Harry Shum Jr.). She then asks Yeohs Yu if she will take her on as an apprentice. Meanwhile the West Lotus crew scheme to get the sword and Yu gathers a ragtag band of martial-arts mercenaries with names like ""The Flying Blade of Shantung"" ""Thunder Fist Chan"" and ""Silver Dart Shi"" who are led by Donnie Yens quietly brooding ""Silent Wolf."" This dirty half-dozen comes together in one of the films most thrilling action showstoppers as Yen (forever a legend for his battles with Jet Li in the 1992 classic Once Upon a Time in China II) takes on countless goons at a tavern snapping their ankles in the style of a kid playing a game of hopscotch. The table is set for the third-act West Lotus showdown. While Sword of Destiny looks tremendous and the fight scenes are giddy fun you cant help but get the sensation that something is missing. There isnt a moment like the one in the swaying tree tops from the original that transports you and makes you feel like youre witnessing something youve never seen before. Its the definition of solid.
