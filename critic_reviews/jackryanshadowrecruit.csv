By David Denby Chris Pine and Nonso Anozie in a movie directed by Kenneth Branagh.   Credit Illustration by Tomer Hanuka Chris Pine has startlingly bright blue eyes thick dark eyebrows and a way of seeming to look for something special even when hes just staring into space--a gift of intentness that works well for him in ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" where he plays the latest incarnation of the intellectually dazzling C.I.A.-analyst hero of many books by Tom Clancy. Early in the movie a thug tries to kill Ryan in a Moscow hotel and Pine also gives a successful impression of a man frightened to death--eyes darting wildly mouth open wider than most acting coaches would advise. Hes an enjoyably talented actor in these early scenes. Like ""Batman Begins"" ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" and ""Man of Steel"" the new movie begins as a myth of conception or as its more commonly known the reboot of a half-dead franchise. We see Ryan as a marine in Afghanistan in 2003 his helicopter goes down his lower spine is mashed and he has to learn to walk again. He gets help from a medical student (Keira Knightley) who is holding out for a date until he can overcome the excruciating pain and run like a track star a demand that is supposed to be charming in a feisty sort of way. The movie then skips ahead to his recruitment into the C.I.A. by the super-agent William Harper (Kevin Costner trying to look mysterious and dangerous by not doing much). Most of the rest is set in the ""new"" Moscow which despite many cutting-edge skyscrapers and a glass-and-metal office of icy brilliance is pretty much like the perfidious old Moscow that Clancy prized in Cold War days. A sinister Russian oligarch Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh) has been buying up U.S. Treasury bonds through dummy corporations. He orders a terrorist attack on American soil after which he intends to sell the bonds crashing the dollar and the economy as a whole. Explaining the plan to Harper Ryan allows that an American economic collapse might cause Russias economy to crash too but he quickly adds that the Russians have oil reserves and will survive. He fails to point out that the Americans have a barrel or two in reserve themselves. Thus ends the exposition of economic warfare. Tom Clancy was an insurance salesman in Maryland when in the early nineteen-eighties he wrote a book ""The Hunt for Red October"" that Ronald Reagan with a handsome public mention turned into a best-seller. Clancys career took off like well like one of his rockets. Too nearsighted to serve in the armed forces Clancy who kept a tank on his front lawn was a military fantasist whose end-is-nigh concoctions spawned a franchise empire of video games Clancy books by other hands and of course movies. He died last October and I dont know if he had an opinion of this movies scenario (not based on any of his novels) but I wonder if he would have approved. The movie which was directed by Branagh and written by Adam Cozad and David Koepp features some rifles and revolvers but few of the bases missiles advanced artillery and ecstatically enumerated ordnances and ranges that Clancy loved so well. The Jack Ryan films have never been a proper franchise. James Bond no matter who plays him and no matter what the actors age always seems about forty; its existentially impossible for him to be much older just as its existentially impossible for Nancy Drew to be any older than a teen-ager. Jason Bourne does age--his story as recorded in the three movies starring Matt Damon was consecutive and heart-wrenching. Bond and Bourne one playful one serious are both genuine franchise heroes. Ryan is just a property. He has no fixed identity and his age fluctuates according to which actor is currently bankable. He was played by a devilishly handsome but puppyish Alec Baldwin in ""Red October"" and by a fiftyish scowling Harrison Ford in ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger."" In the latter Ryan disrupts a covert war run by the White House against drug cartels in Colombia. The best of the series the movie is morally ambiguous and complicated in a way the others dont come close to. Ben Affleck cleft and eager took over for ""The Sum of All Fears"" which begins with Israel losing a nuclear bomb and not bothering to recover it allowing it to fall into the hands of neo-Nazi terrorists. How can you identify with a hero who jumps around in age and gets stuck in stupid plots? The series had hit bottom. Branagh doesnt go for the fragmented glimpses-of-action style perfected by the director Paul Greengrass and the cinematographer Oliver Wood in ""The Bourne Supremacy"" and ""The Bourne Ultimatum."" The images produced here by Branagh and his cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos are stable glossy gleaming--a crisp black-on-black look that delivers paranoia in the chic style of a coolly disdainful fashion show. In Branaghs favorite trope C.I.A. people pass one another secret materials in the Moscow streets like Olympic runners handing off batons. Branagh who started out in movies directing Shakespeare has turned into a speed freak. He and his editor Martin Walsh have increased the tempo of the international thriller without spinning into incoherence. ""Shadow Recruit"" is fun in a minor winter-season way. If the producers stick with Chris Pine as he ages they may end up with something worth caring about. In the Chilean film ""Gloria"" (opening  January 24th) directed by Sebastian Lelio and written by Lelio and Gonzalo Maza Gloria (Paulina Garcia) a good-looking and adventurous woman in middle age regularly visits singles bars in Santiago. Placid and fifties-European in ambience these establishments cater to substantial-looking people who dance tamely to retro pop and look for a bed partner. The atmosphere is congenial and relatively quiet and conversation is easy. At one bar Gloria who is the divorced mother of two grown children meets a somewhat older man Rodolfo (Sergio Hernandez). Is he right for her? Moviegoers instinctively crave sexual egalitarianism in romance--Hollywood has always understood this--and at first it may seem that Gloria needs someone younger. Rodolfo has a fine modulated voice and melancholy eyes--he is given to nobly romantic sentiments and the recitation of terrible love poetry--but he appears tired. He stumbles a bit he says that he too is divorced and the father of two adult daughters who remain dependent on him (his mobile phone keeps ringing with urgent requests). But smitten with Gloria he presses ahead and she goes to bed with him. Lelio shoots explicit sex scenes between these two matter-of-factly demonstrating a striking good sense that among other things makes the jokey nervousness about middle-aged sex in a pair of recent Meryl Streep movies--""Its Complicated"" and ""Hope Springs""--seem even more embarrassing in retrospect. Its a little hard to understand how we are supposed to take Rodolfo though. Is Sergio Hernandez miscast? Perhaps not. Judging from this movie youd think that Chile is a country without irony or even much humor. The culture clearly isnt as media-obsessed as ours is--for instance people sing together at home for entertainment--and conversations are blunt rather than knowing. Rodolfos earnestness fits right in with this tone and Gloria wants to believe in him. On the surface shes an ordinary rather lonely middle-class woman. She has an office job that she doesnt much care about; her son a musician and a single parent is remote; her daughter whom she adores takes off for Sweden to live with her boyfriend. Yet there are mysteries in Glorias character and the movie chronicles a strange upsetting month or two in which everything in her life threatens to unravel. Paulina Garcia who won the best-actress award at last years Berlin film festival for the role has a magical smile and a mobile face and body--at times Gloria seems a young woman--and she reacts so idiosyncratically to events that she keeps us fascinated even when the script turns inarticulate and patchy. Lelio puts Gloria at the center of each scene and gives her moments alone when trifling incidents and even the quiet passing of time feel like an interrogation of her life. Is she on the verge of diminishing into old age? Various signs of the end appear a hairless scary-looking cat; a puppeteers dancing skeleton in a shopping mall. Talking to Rodolfo she marvels at the black holes in space. She fears death perhaps or at least disappearing into nothingness but at the same time she may be drawn to it. When she finds herself stranded in Vina del Mar a beach resort on the Pacific coast she drifts into a night of drinking makes out with a stranger she meets at a casino and wakes up on the beach at dawn alone and missing a shoe. This long night of dissipation and its sordid aftermath make up Lelios most intense and sustained sequence but he and Maza build a sense of Glorias disintegration in many small touches. Nothing in her soul or her body changes abruptly; she doesnt experience anything as dramatic as despair. Gloria slips a little the way any of us might slip in a crisis of morale from one minute to the next one day to another. Yet she is also brave and her escapades are meant to be taken as a refusal to go quietly. At the end of the movie when Gloria looks at herself appraisingly in a mirror we seem to be seeing her for the first time.

"Disavowed Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous No Place Like Home  Next History Boys Second Act Facebook Twitter Print Movies Disavowed Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit What Hollywood doesnt understand about Tom Clancy -- and how its killing a franchise by Alex Pappademas on January 17 2014 Never forget In the last Jack Ryan movie 2002s The Sum of All Fears Austrian neo-Nazis procure a loose Israeli nuke misplaced during the Yom Kippur War and detonate it inside the ""Baltimore Forum"" during the Super Bowl. This was less than a year after 9/11 -- possibly too soon tastewise for a popcorn movie about terrorists leveling Baltimore inarguably an odd moment to reintroduce Tom Clancys two-fisted CIA-analyst hero whose late-Cold War roots suddenly seemed like they were from a more innocent time. (In the novel published in 1991 the stadium was Mile High in Denver and the villains were Palestinian East German and -- you crazy for this one Tom Clancy -- a Sioux Indian.) Fears starred Ben Affleck as a young out-of-his-depth version of Ryan unaccustomed to the field. Affleck stepping into a role originated by Alec Baldwin and made iconic by Harrison Ford seemed a little out of his depth too. Matt Damon might have been more believable as a brilliant paper-pusher thrust into the line of fire but he was busy making The Bourne Identity which opened just one week after Sum and launched one of the most influential action franchises of the 2000s. Affleck went on to make Daredevil and Jack Ryan disappeared from movie screens for more than a decade. Director Kenneth Branaghs re-reboot Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit opens at the London School of Economics where our hero-to-be (Chris Pine in Vans and a hoodie) wakes up from a nap on the quad to discover that all the extras are nervously peas-and-carrotsing about what turns out to be the attack on the World Trade Center. Eighteen months later now-Lieutenant Ryan is in a chopper over Afghanistan and he and his fellow Marines are having the kind of jocular conversation about football you should never have in a military aircraft if youre a minor character in a movie. In The Hunt for Red October we hear about Jack surviving a helicopter crash and teaching himself to walk again an indication that hes tougher than his job description would suggest; Shadow Recruit actually follows him through the process from triage to rehab at Walter Reed where he meets and impresses both a third-year surgical resident named Cathy (Keira Knightley) and a CIA officer named Harper played by Kevin Costner. As if to banish all doubt that Jack Ryan began life as a struggling writers fantasy-self characters in Jack Ryan stories are forever asking Jack Ryan if hes the same Jack Ryan who wrote that brilliant paper on blah blah blah. When Harper first meets Jack he compliments Jacks masters thesis about liquidity incidents in post-Soviet markets. When Jack asks how Harper managed to read a paper he never finished writing Harper whispers ""Im in the CIA"" because apparently the shadow-recruitment process involves telling people that youre in the CIA LOL JK but no for real though. ""People dont like you guys much these days"" Jack says. ""Waterboarding rendition."" Harper says that wasnt his unit that hes just interested in making sure we dont get hit again. As far as ethical questions about covert operations in the post-9/11 era go thats the end of that conversation. The movie isnt interested in how issues like surveillance or torture or drone warfare might weigh on the conscience of a young spy. You could certainly argue that it wouldnt be a Tom Clancy movie if it took up those questions and that because its just a Tom Clancy movie its not obligated to do so; you could also argue that a movie that uses a shot of the smoldering Twin Towers as an inciting incident has forfeited the its-just-a-Tom Clancy-movie defense. Either way Cut to 2013 Jack is living in New York with Cathy working undercover as a compliance officer at a Wall Street firm and watching out for suspicious transactions that may be funding terrorism. Instead he stumbles on a Russian oligarchs plot to collapse the dollar and crash the U.S. economy creating a second Great Depression. This is still Clancys universe so of course sooner or later it all comes back to the damn Russians. ""Theyre still ideological"" Ryans boss at the investment bank warns him ""but their new ideology is money."" Thats a misdirect though -- Cherevin the oligarch (whos played by Branagh) turns out to be carrying a grudge and some shrapnel from his time fighting CIA-backed guerrillas in Afghanistan years ago. His ideology is ideology and when he sets it in motion he says things like ""We will avenge our mother Russia"" and ""America will bleed"" classic bad-Russkie lines to which Clancy himself would have tipped his USS Iowa cap. Cherevin turns out to also be plotting some terrorism of the old-school violent non-financial variety. I couldnt quite figure out why but Im not an evil genius. Cherevin is supposed to be although he falls for both the old bump-and-pickpocket-the-keycard trick and Cathy making flirty eyes at him over drinks while referencing Mikhail Lermontovs ""achingly desperate"" Russian romanticism. Cathy is having drinks with Cherevin because this movie flouts convention by letting the future Mrs. Ryan get involved in the cloak-and-dagger side of things as something more than a hostage at least for a while. In the two Ford films wed sometimes see Anne Archer perform surgery to demonstrate that she was a worthy partner for Jack; in this one she proves it by risking her life. She comes to Moscow expecting to catch Jack with another woman and finds a gun in his hotel room instead. Cherevin finds out shes in town and insists to Ryan that she join them for dinner. Were supposed to believe that Harper and Ryan therefore have no choice but to put Ryans actual non-CIA-trained girlfriend in harms way. I dont mean to harp on this because giving a female character this much secret-agency in the manly world Clancy built is a brave and interesting choice. But a few scenes later we find out that Harpers support team on the ground in Moscow includes at least one female American who is presumably capable of saying ""Hi Im Cathy"" when prompted. Could they not have sent her as Jacks date? Of course not. Cherevin has to take the real Cathy hostage so Jack can chase him. By this point Branaghs starting to cut corners sacrificing logic and believability to get to the big action set pieces faster. The scene in which Ryan figures out every detail of Cherevins plan takes about three absurdly hectic minutes of screen time. It also involves Jack ordering a room full of CIA computer jocks to check ""Instagram Facebook Hopscotch Reddit"" for clues because theres always a chance that the terrorists have been hosting an AMA or applying the Valencia filter to their selfies. Cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos who shot Sleuth and Thor for Branagh gives the chases themselves an appealingly visceral rough-and-tumble quality so you almost dont notice how derivative they are. But in John McTiernans The Hunt for Red October and the two Ryan films Harrison Ford made with Philip Noyce the action was never the point. The moment you wait for in each one is the scene in which Ryan confronts a room full of disdainful authority figures and tells them theyre wrong and hes right which of course he always is because hes Jack Ryan and when he says to retask the satellites you retask the damn satellites. In Shadow Recruit theres no time for a scene like that and you miss it -- its like Pine is playing through the Jack Ryan video game in ""Easy"" mode. I didnt think there was a point to Jack as a character until I realized this movie had missed it. As synonymous as Tom Clancy was with a certain kind of kiss-ass hawkishness as steeped as his stories were in the culture of Washington and the military they werent really political novels and the movies arent political films. They use war and espionage as a context for fantasies about masculine hyper-competence specifically the kind of competence that stems from experience. ""The only people Ryan needed to impress"" Clancy writes in Red October ""were those who knew him; he cared little for the rest."" Those are the kind of words you use to sell Lincolns or Scotch or Viagra to consumers of a certain age who like to think theyve learned a thing or two. Clancys career took off when Ronald Reagan called Red October ""my type of yarn"" and joked that the book was keeping him up late. But Jack Ryan became synonymous with airplane reading and business travel because Jack Ryan is really a middle managers fantasy. Hes a little older hes forever being brought onto some project thats gone sideways and with his superior skill set and hard-won insights hes going to show both the brass and the junior staffers whats what -- albeit in a quiet unshowy way because in Clancys world the worst epithet you can hurl at someone is ""cowboy."" Im aware that commercial and cultural forces require everything to be rebooted triennially with fresher hotter stars. But this is the second time the Jack Ryan franchise has rejected a youth transplant. Maybe Jack is supposed to be old a little weary a man reluctantly rising to the occasion despite his cynicism about the system. Even Harrison Ford probably the best Ryan well ever get sometimes seemed a little too much like a movie star in the part. In Clear and Present Danger he grins and banters with the guards at the gates of the White House like hes driving onto the lot at Paramount and walks into the CIA directors office like hes walking onto a yacht. But he also takes meals at his desk -- a sad-looking sandwich in a plastic clamshell a big stack of reference books about war and a cup of bad coffee. Maybe the next Jack Ryan should be an actor who looks like hed eat that bummer of a lunch without being bummed about it. Louis C.K. Shadow Recruit anyone?

Rex Reed Reviews Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters movie Jack Ryans Roots Shadow Recruit Explores the Early Years of Tom Clancys Fictional Spy But a muddy chronology will test your patience By Rex Reed  01/17/14 1100am Chris Pine is Jack Ryan in Shadow Recruit. The dim star wattage in this fifth rehash is palpable from the start with Chris Pine on sabbatical from the Star Trek franchise playing Tom Clancys CIA paste job in the Jack Ryan franchise and doing nothing for his career in the trade-off. This overstuffed series of books grown men take to office johns and oversexed teenage girls use to blot their lipstick has always baffled me but the derring-do political heroics and overzealous crypto-technology has been tackled by more charismatic casts than the one on display here. First there was Alec Baldwin stalking a Soviet submarine in The Hunt for Red October (1990) followed by Harrison Ford the best Jack Ryan of them all in two thrillers in succession as he tried to stop the I.R.A. from blowing up Buckingham Palace in Patriot Games (1992) and two years later battled the Colombian drug cartel in A Clear and Present Danger (1994). By the time preppy pretty boy Ben Affleck took over in the poorly received Sum of All Fears in 2002 narrowly surviving a nuclear bomb sent by neo-Nazi terrorists to blow up a football stadium in Baltimore the series had run out of preposterous fodder to keep kids awake and I prayed it would stay that way. I should have known better. Only a fool would overestimate Hollywood on the scent of a warmed-over moneymaking slab of box-office bacon. And so we get Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit with Chris Pine barely beyond the age of acne escorting us through the reluctant spys early years like a Boy Scout playing James Bond. This espionage thriller centers on Jack the new covert recruit untrained and inexperienced pushing pencils behind a desk at C.I.A. headquarters who is suddenly dispatched for reasons known only to screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp on his first perilous field assignment to unravel a terrorist Russian scheme to crash the U.S. economy and destroy Wall Street and then the world. The goal of the villains in all Jack Ryan flicks is to blow up something. It might as well be the world. The film is sloppily directed by the distinguished Kenneth Branagh who also plays the leading Soviet terrorist an oily Soviet intellectual with a bad accent named Viktor Cherevin who takes his homicidal orders from a sinister oligarch played by--are you ready?--Mikhail Baryshnikov. This Shadow Recruit chapter is pieced together with spit and chewing gum from chunks of all 13 Tom Clancy books. On the surface Jack is hurled into harms way the minute he enters his hotel room in Moscow followed by the unexpected uninvited arrival of his girlfriend Cathy (a wasted Kiera Knightley who has been displayed to better advantage elsewhere) a long time-wasting dinner in which Mr. Branagh tries to seduce her and a nightcap during which Cathy is kidnapped and dragged through the Kremlin screaming for her life with Jack in hot pursuit following orders on a cell phone from his boss and supervisor military mentor William Harper (Kevin Costner). If you feel none of this makes sense and the plot begins to resemble an SNL skit on global satire youre not alone. Wisely realizing it is no longer enough to evoke terror and then trivialize it with corny heroics the creative team behind Shadow Recruit takes up as little of your time as necessary sending the Americans smashing their way through the rainy murky streets of Moscow (played by Liverpool) without the ability to speak the language hire an interpreter or follow a street map. Instead to make myriad mumbo-jumbos more believable they try to make the superhero more human by backflipping to his humble roots in a true jumble of chronological borscht that explains the Jack Ryan mythology. So although this installment claims to be a global action thriller set in the present day Jack is first seen as a student at the London School of Economics who awakens from a nap on a park bench on Sept. 11 2001 to the epic shock of terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Relinquishing all hope for graduation and postponing his Ph.D. he joins the Marines. Eighteen months later hes in Afghanistan where a helicopter attack forces him into medical retirement and eight months of rehab at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center under the care of a sexy nurse named Cathy (Ms. Knightley) and the watchful eye of senior C.I.A. recruiter Mr. Costner. After what seems like a lifetime of extraneous exposition that does nothing to elucidate an already lubberly fictional evolution Jack and Cathy become lovers after he leaves his job as a stock analyst and becomes a secret spy. Suspecting hes having an affair Cathy who is now a pediatrics surgeon follows him to Moscow and becomes an equal partner in his passion to save the world with his life hanging in the balance. (Physical abuse broken bones and black eyes are O.K. as long as they arent caused by another undercover operative in a skirt--though its anybodys guess how one man can survive so many beatings with a bad back). After this much padding theres no time to get the movie back on point for a happy ending before the Soviets blow up Wall Street. But you get the picture even if I dont. Nobody connected with Shadow Recruit has learned the art of consistent suspense--an element essential to the success of any techno-thriller. The chronology is so muddy that you dont know what youre watching anyway. They seem to be making it up as they go along. The Jack Ryan movies differ from the Tom Clancy books in every way possible showing the C.I.A. Everyman at an assortment of ages sometimes married to Cathy sometimes single but always jumping around inconsistently through years and settings that challenge credulity playing hopscotch with time frames. In the earlier Jack Ryan flicks which take place before 9/11 Jack and Cathy are already wed and have four kids. This time the events of 9/11 are already part of the past and they havent even met yet.  By my rough calculation the real Jack Ryan should be approximately 103. Preposterous but moderately engaging Jack Ryan has outlived his welcome and theres no end in sight. With more sequels to come well no doubt live to see the worlds cheesiest counterterrorist in some future incarnation played by Justin Bieber.

"Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit (PG-13) Jack Ryan makes a flawed but lively return. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com1/16/2014 Editor rating 2.5 Tom Clancys covert-ops hero Jack Ryan is well on his way to becoming James Bond at least in terms of how many actors have taken a shot at the role. First came Alec Baldwin in The Hunt for Red October; then Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck (the Timothy Dalton of Ryans) took their turns. Now Chris Pine tries his hand at a reboot more than 10 years after the last Jack Ryan film with mixed but not entirely unpleasant results. Pine who has been so good and so instrumental in J.J. Abrams Star Trek series as Captain Kirk turns out to be a decent Ryan and despite its silly title Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit makes up for many of its missteps with a speedy pace that doesnt allow you to examine it too closely. Director Kenneth Branagh who also co-stars whips through the characters creation story at breakneck speed A student at the London School of Economics young Jack is inspired to join the Marines after 9/11. Injured in a helicopter crash he struggles through rehab learns to walk again and falls in love with his physical therapist Cathy (Keira Knightley). Hanging around is an older guy who has the look of a clandestine agent (Kevin Costner) who eventually recruits Jack to work for the CIA on the financial side. You can serve your country with a desk job he tells Jack. Just dont tell your girlfriend. All of this takes place in about 45 seconds or seems to thank God. The rest of the movie -- which is not based on any book by Clancy who died last year but on the characters he created -- focuses on Jacks attempts to foil a plot by Viktor Cherevin (Branagh) a shifty dangerous financier in Moscow who may be plotting acts of terrorism (economic and otherwise) against the United States in retaliation for not supporting vital Russian oil interests. Yes I know. You almost nodded off during the last part of that sentence. Branagh knows how to invest the ridiculous with a sort of grandeur -- Exhibit A the surprisingly fun Thor -- but Shadow Recruit is more straightforward in nature so he cant get too fancy. Thus the threat of financial mayhem is dangled but were quickly assured there is likely to be an event explosive in nature too. The downside of the movies fast pace is that Jack solves problems in mere moments with extraordinary intuition and sometimes his revelations feel like cheating. Other elements feel a bit off too. A plan to steal Viktors office ID card and break into his computer goes far too easily and some of the action sequences have a generic feel; you wont be able to distinguish them from car chases in a dozen other movies. And someone really needs to remind this budding government star that even though the first Cold War is over theres still a strong chance a Moscow hotel room is bugged (particularly if youve already had someone try to kill you in it). When Cathy arrives there unexpectedly in the middle of Jacks mission and demands the truth about what hes doing there he finally admits ""Im in the CIA."" Maybe in the next installment -- its inevitable isnt it? -- hell be sharper. With any luck so will the movie. Cast Chris Pine Kevin Costner Keira Knightley Kenneth Branagh.

Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 17 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Jan. 17 2014 223PM EST Comments AA Directed by Kenneth Branagh Written by Adam Cozad and David Koepp Starring Chris Pine Keira Knightley Country USA Language English As the titular CIA analyst in Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit Chris Pine has the slightly nervous look of a guy in over his head. Whether that anxiety belongs to the rookie field agent character or the actor playing him is up for debate. Considering the way that Pine made himself comfortable in William Shatners yellow pyjamas in the new Star Trek films though it seems right to give him the benefit of the doubt. He doesnt seem to be an actor who scares easily. The Globe and Mail FILM Video How to perfect your Russian accent Its also not as if the four previous films adapted from the works of the late novelist Tom Clancy cast a particularly long shadow. Youd have to go all the way back to 1990s The Hunt For Red October starring a then-ascendant Alec Baldwin to find a Jack Ryan film that really holds up. And even then that had more to do with the presence of Sean Connery as a steely Soviet submarine captain. The Hunt for Red October ended on a harmonious note of perestroika with the Russian and American heroes literally sailing off together into the sunset. Almost 25 years later Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit tries its best to reignite the Cold War with tepid results.Inspired to sign up for the Navy by the events of September 11 and injured in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan Pines Ryan is clandestinely recruited during his convalescence by covert-ops guru Harper (Kevin Costner) who asks him to be the Agencys inside man on Wall Street. At first the posting involves riding the subway wearing nice suits and telling little white lies to his fiance (Keira Knightley practising her Yankee diction in a truly thankless role) but when Ryan gets wind of a complicated scheme to cripple the global economy hes dispatched to frigid Moscow.From there Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit settles into a familiar espionage-flick groove borrowing from both its predecessors and also the Bond franchise (Ryans shell-shocked reaction to his first kill as an operative blatantly recalls Daniel Craigs ambivalence at the beginning of Casino Royale. Certainly Kenneth Branaghs performance as the villainous cirrhosis-stricken businessman Viktor Cherevin who gradually emerges as Ryans main foil belongs in a 007 adventure - or The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show since his outrageously put-on Russian accent makes him sound like hes looking for Moose and Squirrel.But at least Branaghs acting has some flair which is more than can be said for his direction which is mostly just functional. Forget the glory days of Henry V and Hamlet even Thor with its canted angles and slightly chintzy sense of grandeur was a better showcase for this former wunderkinds directing talents. The biggest problem however is the screenplay by Adam Cozad and David Koepp which does an end run around Clancys Jack Ryan mythology and winds up going nowhere fast. The appeal of the Jack Ryan character at least on the page was that he was always the smartest guy in the room. In Shadow Recruit that doesnt seem to be much of an accomplishment because the movie around him is so dumb.

"Review Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit dives into mild intrigue - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit dives into mild intrigue Jack Ryan David Lee / Paramount Pictures Chris Pine is Jack Ryan in ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit."" Chris Pine is Jack Ryan in ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit."" (David Lee / Paramount Pictures) Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic We all know you cant tell a book by its cover but can you tell a film by its release date? Where ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" is concerned that becomes a bit of a trick question.A glance at the calendar reminds us that this tale of espionage and derring-do starring Chris Pine as CIA analyst Jack Ryan is coming to theaters in January the traditional elephant burial ground for major studio releases. But before ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" dislodged it into 2014 ""Jack Ryan"" possessed a coveted Christmas slot all its own. So is this film a holiday gem slumming in the low-rent district or a tawdry impostor stripped of ideas above its station? The answer lies somewhere in between.GRAPHIC Faces to watch 2014 | Entertainment As directed by Kenneth Branagh who costars along with fellow Brit Keira Knightley this ""Jack Ryan"" has the additional burden of being the fifth film celebrating the exploits of the wily operative previously played by Alec Baldwin (""The Hunt for Red October"") Harrison Ford (""Patriot Games"" ""Clear and Present Danger"") and Ben Affleck (""The Sum of All Fears"").Compared to those films as well as the modern gold standard of the genre as represented by the ""Bourne"" epics ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" comes off as a reasonable facsimile serviceable but not compelling something that could pass for the real thing if youre not looking too hard.Because this is a combination reboot/origins story as well as the first Ryan story not based directly on one of Tom Clancys bestselling novels screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp have taken it upon themselves to fashion an elaborate back story for Ryan. ""Shadow Recruit"" introduces him as a student at the London School of Economics who patriotically joins the Marines after 9/11 only to be blown out of the sky over Afghanistan.PHOTOS Behind the scenes of movies and TV The silver lining to that near-fatal situation turns out to be twofold. Ryan meets Cathy Muller (Knightley) the comely medical student involved with his rehab at Walter Reed who becomes the love of his life and he catches the attention of Naval Cmdr. William Harper (Kevin Costner) a steely sort who recruits the young man for the CIA.Pine a capable actor who is just as he should be as Captain Kirk in the ongoing rebooting of the ""Star Trek"" franchise is clearly intended to be the recipient the torch of the Jack Ryan franchise is being passed to.Though Pine is acceptable in this latest rebooting what Cmdr. Harper calls the ""Boy Scout on a field trip look"" he falls prey to emphasizes the absence of the kind of gravitas that Costner himself employs and that is a chink in the younger actors acting armor.IN CASE YOU MISSED IT Oscar nominations 2014The bulk of ""Shadow Recruits"" action picks up 10 years after he signs with the agency. Ryan works as a compliance officer for a major Wall Street firm and without telling live-in fiancee Cathy also toils as a numbers cruncher for the CIA. When a clandestine meeting with fellow operatives is necessary it takes place at Manhattans Film Forum providing a nice plug for this estimable movie house.Smarter and more diligent than most Ryan discovers that the pesky Russians his firm is doing business with seem to be hiding enormous amounts of money. The CIA wants him to go to Moscow and audit everyones books a situation that in one of the films less convincing plot strands makes fiancee Cathy nervous enough to show up in the Russian capital as well.It will come as no surprise that those Russians do have something underhanded up their sleeve. Ballet legend Mikhail Baryshnikov has an uncredited cameo as a nefarious government minister but the key culprit is a poetry-loving plutocrat named Viktor Cherevin a juicy part that director Branagh has kept for himself.SNEAKS A sneak peek at upcoming filmsBranagh does an excellent job as the dour fanatical Cherevin a man with more secrets than St. Basils Cathedral has onion domes and his machinations are so threatening to American interests that the formerly desk-bound Ryan is forced to go operational in a big way.Though the considerable action in ""Shadow Warriors"" second half is briskly done there is no shaking the feeling that Branagh and his cast are a kind of an espionage film B team capable of mild diversion but nothing more.---Jack Ryan Shadow RecruitMPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of violence and intense action and brief strong languageRunning time 1 hour 46 minutesPlaying In general releasekenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Photos The actors who played Jack Ryan Chris Pines Jack Ryan is a different kind of patriot-hero With Tom Clancy death an odd spot for Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad73deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-jack-ryan-shadow-recruit-review-20140117,0,7012829.story#axzz2qc6vIxbj",200,jackryanshadowrecruit9,jackryanshadowrecruit,latimes
"Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; jack-ryan-shadow-recruit ) Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit (United States/Russia 2014) January 16 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Probably the best way to approach a Jack Ryan movie is to look at it like a James Bond film. The lead actor keeps changing the supporting actors are rarely the same and the time period varies. Bond is Bond whether hes played by Sean Connery George Lazenby Roger Moore Timothy Dalton Pierce Brosnan or Daniel Craig. In the same way Jack Ryan is Jack Ryan whether hes played by Alec Baldwin Harrison Ford Ben Affleck or Chris Pine. And just as the Bond filmmakers moved beyond Ian Flemings written material so the Ryan movie-makers have now taken the character away from Tom Clancys novels. The core essentials that made the previous Jack Ryan movies accessible and enjoyable remain intact in Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit even if many of the individual pieces have changed. What remains undecided at this point is whether or not this fifth Ryan production will represent a Casino Royale-style reboot for the franchise. Is this it for Clancys hero or does he have more cinematic adventures ahead of him? Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit provides the best motion picture adventure for the title character since his introduction in The Hunt for Red October. This also doubles as an ""origin story"" taking viewers back to his beginnings. In this telling thats 9/11/01 when Ryan (Chris Pine) watches the Twin Towers burn on TV while attending college in England and thereafter decides to devote himself to the protection of his country from all enemies ""foreign and domestic."" After being injured in Afghanistan he is recruited by Commander Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) to join the CIA as an analyst. The Jack Ryan readers know from Clancys books is still in the formative stages here and hes more of an action hero than has previously been seen. Ryans role changes from analytical to operational when in his capacity as an undercover agent on Wall Street he discovers the seeds of a Russian conspiracy to crash the U.S. economy. The scheme unlike the ones at the center of many espionage thrillers sounds at least remotely plausible. Ordered by Harper Ryan heads off to Moscow to investigate. The mastermind of the plot Viktor Cherevin (Kenneth Branagh) sees the American as ""dangerous"" and seeks to have him eliminated. Meanwhile dodging bullets and thwarting attempts on his life takes its toll on Ryans relationship with his fiancA(c)e Cathy (Kiera Knightley) who thinks his evasiveness might be evidence of an affair. Director Kenneth Branagh who showed in his Shakespeare adaptations that he understands how to maintain a smooth controlled pace uses that quality to good advantage in Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit. There are at least three action sequences (a hotel ambush a heist and a car chase) that in less expert hands could have been dull and generic. As choreographed by Branagh they crackle with tension and suspense. At its best the movie feels relentless almost exhausting. The necessary connective tissue between the adrenaline-fueled scenes is also deftly handled; the movie rarely threatens to bog down due to excessive exposition. At the same time theres a little time for character development. There are some structural issues in the movies final half-hour after the scene shifts from Russia to the United States. Although the filmmakers find a way to make the climax thrilling its preceded by a segment featuring a group gathered in a ""war room"" making deductions about the identity and location of a terrorist. This isnt inherently cinematic material and although Branagh keeps the energy level high theres a sense that the movie has wandered off-track if only for a little while. Getting Ryan back into the heart of the action requires a cheat although its necessary to avoid an unsatisfying ending. Chris Pine perhaps best known for playing Star Treks Captain James T. Kirk Version 2.0 has the presence and physicality to make Ryan a more Bond-esque action hero than he has been in the past. Pine is an excellent choice for this re-envisioning of the role and he takes the character in a different direction. Playing Ryans soon-to-be wife Kiera Knightley is strong and appealing. Kevin Costner is solid in the ""mentor"" role - a part that seems well-suited to him at this stage of his career. And Branagh provides a villain who is less of a 007-style megalomaniac and more of a misguided patriot. Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit was originally scheduled for a December release but was bumped by Paramount to open up a slot for The Wolf of Wall Street. Its delay gives movie-goers something to get excited about in January. This is summer blockbuster quality entertainment delivered in the dead of winter - a most welcome development.

"Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit Chris Pine brings Jack back | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesJack Ryan Shadow Recruit Chris Pine brings Jack backTom Clancy-created spy Jack Ryan is back with Chris Pine in the title role in Jack Ryan Shadow recruit capably directed by Kenneth Branagh.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Jan. 16 2014Jack Ryan Shadow RecruitStarring Chris Pine Kevin Costner Kenneth Branagh Keira Knightley. Directed by Kenneth Branagh. 106 minutes. Opens Jan. 17 at major theatres. PGTom Clancy-created spy Jack Ryan is back battling Russians in Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit but this time theres no Sean Connery on a submarine. Rather its Chris Pines Jack versus Kenneth Branagh as a thin-lipped icy oligarch out to destroy America.Branagh who also directs with a sure and stylish hand is delightfully smooth as Viktor Cherevin a fellow who likes women and vodka but doesnt take kindly to interference. Article Continued BelowTo his credit Star Treks Pine capably handles the lead role which marks the return of Jack Ryan 14 years after Ben Afflecks take on the spy in The Sum of All Fears. While Pines Ryan character is indeed drawn from Clancys world the story is not based on one of the spymaster writers books.This incarnation presents Ryan as a financial whiz recruited by the CIAs world-weary Harper (Kevin Costner) after his post-9/11 tour of duty in Afghanistan. Ryan is recovering from a missile attack on a helicopter at a military hospital when Harper offers him a government-sponsored PhD and a job on Wall Street as a financial analyst. As a sideline hell also monitor potential terrorist transactions.Ryan is reluctant. Hes hardly a fan of how Washington handles itself in some situations. That hesitancy and initial uncertainty about how this spy business works when he is suddenly made active and thrust into the field in Moscow when he suspects a Russian company is up to no good adds a pleasing element of humanity to Pines role.When his fiancee Cathy (Keira Knightley) surprises Ryan turning up in Moscow to spice up what she has been assured is just a dull weekend auditing the books of a Russian corporation she gets dumped into the spy soup too. Cathy a no-nonsense physician takes it rather well when she learns her beloved is a spook. ""I thought you were having an affair""David Koepps script (Premium Rush Mission Impossible) co-written with newcomer Adam Cozad shows well. The dialogue is quick and sharp and there are flourishes to make a spy movie lover smile sleight-of-hand work and the exchange of a brown envelope in a movie theatre showing 1948 black-and-white classic Sorry Wrong Number. Bolstering the usual rote chases of the car and foot variety and scenes of tension in the mobile command post in a parked van is uniformly strong work from the cast. Pines boyish style makes Ryan a somewhat believable spy and gives him a solid stake in the Jack Ryan world alongside Alec Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) and Harrison Ford (Patriot Games Clear and Present Danger).Knightley working a credible American accent seems far less brittle and more approachable than she ever has been and its good to see Mikhail Baryshnikov in an uncredited cameo as a shadowy Russian kingpin.Its with regret that we see the final third of the movie become increasingly silly with a weak side-plot and a final chase that culminates in a showdown that would have killed a busload of superheroes yet leaves our hero with barely a scratch.That kind of screen silliness nets a big nyet.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Larry Horricks/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Larry Horricks/Paramount Pictures Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit Director Kenneth Branagh Genre Spy thriller Drama Running Time 105 minutes Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and intense action and brief strong language With Chris Pine Kevin Costner Keira Knightley Kenneth Branagh A franchise is what we used to call a Burger King or a Shell station but nowadays the word appears more often in relation to movies the Star Wars franchise the Hunger Games franchise the Jack Ryan franchise -- or in the case of Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit the Jack Ryan franchise reboot. I dont know whats more depressing that what fires up studio execs is the hunt for a new franchise or that critics have adopted this business lingo uncritically. Maybe a business reporter would be the best person to talk about Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit. From an artistic standpoint I found it competent moderately suspenseful and without a single surprise -- apart from the fact that its director is Kenneth Branagh who has come a long grim way from his film directing debut in the late 80s Shakespeares Henry V. Come to think of it that was a remake and the Henry character appeared in two other plays -- though Im confident Shakespeare never referred to ""the Henry franchise."" And Jack Ryan is no Henry. Created by the late novelist Tom Clancy hes a Wall Street guy turned CIA agent turned action hero. He has appeared in four big movies The Hunt for Red October starred Alec Baldwin who gave up Ryan and was replaced by Harrison Ford in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger. Then came an attempted reboot called The Sum of All Fears with Ben Affleck which did pretty well but didnt lead to more movies. Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit launches a new storyline with a young Jack played by Chris Pine whos also the young Captain Kirk in the reboot of the Star Trek franchise for the same studio Paramount. Hes the go-to franchise guy I guess though Im not sure why. Hes a good enough actor -- he seethes credibly and moves well but theres nothing funky or idiosyncratic about him. Hes just a guy. The movie begins with Ryan as a student at the London School of Economics when the planes hit the World Trade Center. So he joins the Marines and gets shot down in Afghanistan. As hes rolled into the emergency room a Marine says Ryan personally dragged two survivors out of the plane. ""With a broken back?"" asks the doctor. The message is This guy isnt just an economics wonk. Hes the man. As Ryan struggles to walk at Walter Reed Medical Center Kevin Costner shows up and offers him a CIA job -- undercover in a Wall Street firm. Fast-forward to 10 years later when he uncovers a Russian plot to destroy the U.S economy. In no time hes dispatched to Moscow to confront the likely mastermind played by Branagh himself. The movie is slow and plodding until an attempt on Ryans life and the first brutal gun-and-fisticuffs scene shot mostly in jangly close-ups. Then Ryans doctor girlfriend played by Keira Knightley shows up in Moscow because she doesnt know hes CIA and thinks hes having an affair. Shes quickly embroiled in the cloak-and-dagger stuff leading to a quarrel thats the only memorable scene in the picture thanks in part to Costners expert underplaying. That scene is the start of a long and clever third act that begins in a fancy Moscow restaurant and ends in the Hudson River involving decent fights noisy car chases and the usual ticking time bomb. I found a lot of holes in the plot though to point them out here would spoil too much. But espionage movies are often fun -- its the brainy popcorn genre -- and Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit hits its marks. The problem is the marks themselves. Theyre too low. Mission Impossible the Bourne series TVs 24 -- theyre all more gripping and the last Mission Impossible movie Brad Birds Ghost Protocol was sensational. Branagh brings no style to Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit and no heart. For once that business word franchise seems all too apt.

(Photo credit Larry Horricks) By Ann Hornaday January 16 2014 Follow AnnHornaday Theres something disorienting -- but oddly appropriate -- about ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit "" opening the day after Oscar nominations were announced . No sooner do we pay homage to the very best that Hollywood has to offer (and Hollywood came forth with an exceptional bounty last year) than we are forced to consider yet another example of the franchise obsession on which the industry depends to survive. Snap out of it movie fans Awards are all well and good but a studios gotta eat. The descent from the sublime to the banal isnt as depressing as it might have been with ""Shadow Recruit"" although the trip is often vertiginous. Directed by Kenneth Branagh in a jumbled blur of dizzying close-ups revolving camera moves hand-held action sequences and deceptive layers of shiny surfaces ""Shadow Recruit"" threatens to become less a resuscitation of the beloved Tom Clancy brand than yet another jumbled jarring action flick that isnt nearly as smart as its brainy protagonist. But with Chris Pine competently stepping into shoes once occupied by Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck (and briefly Alec Baldwin) Jack Ryan seems to have a reasonable chance at surviving into the 21st century -- as long as the space-time continuum separating the Ryanverse and ""Star Trek s"" Capt. Kirk holds true. In ""Shadow Recruit"" Ryan is pursuing his PhD at the London School of Economics when he watches the World Trade Center fall in 2001; after enlisting with the Marines and suffering a potentially fatal injury hes recruited by a shadowy CIA honcho named Harper (an excellent Kevin Costner) to work as an analyst in financial espionage. Soon enough Ryan goes from being a Wall Street wolf in sheeps clothing to a gun-toting bad-guy-offing full-on spy in Moscow. (As Harper tells him while putting a gun in his hands ""Youre operational now."") Viewers dont necessarily have to follow the arcane dialogue about algorithms and cellphone triangulations -- or decipher the countless shots of computer screens -- to understand the supremely simple plot. Suffice it to say that true to Ryans roots in Clancys Cold War-era imagination hes once again fighting the Russians -- here personified in a ruthless villain nicely underplayed by Branagh whos twice joined by a cameo performer sure to elicit sentimental sighs in audience members of a certain age (i.e. mine i.e. dont ask). Branagh who proved his action bona fides with ""Thor "" does an inarguably competent job of choreographing a modestly intelligent espionage thriller even if its impossible to identify anything new hes bringing to an already groaning table. If one wishes that he would pull the camera back once in a while to provide respite from the ganglia-jangling swishes and pans one need only remember that the end-use of ""Shadow Recruit"" is on the five-inch screen of the guy sitting next to you on the Red Line. From ""1984"" to ""Enemy of the State"" Hollywood has predicted some of the real-life tracking methods used by intelligence agencies. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) That movies now must be made for both iPhones and Imax is less a backhanded testament to Hollywoods chronic lack of visual and spatial sense than the rock and hard place between which filmmakers are so uncomfortably jammed these days. Emerging into a new platform-neutral world Ryan seems more like a throwback than ever. But hes a proud one and Pine possesses the charisma and chops to play him convincingly as both a thinker and a doer. The most audacious ""Shadow Recruit"" sequel may be the one that dispenses with swishes pans and Bourne -again distractions and simply lets Jack Ryan play. Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit   (106 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and intense action and brief strong profanity. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Tom Clancys Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) as a young covert CIA analyst uncovers a Russian plot to crash the U.S. economy with a terrorist attack. (Photo/Video Paramount) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Jan. 16 2014 305 p.m. ET Instead of a wolf on Wall Street ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" gives us a fox--the Tom Clancy hero played this time by Chris Pine. A covert CIA agent Jack leads a double life as an executive in a brokerage house using his business and finance creds to sniff out iffy transactions that may reveal terrorist plots. The story loosely based on the Clancy canon doesnt make a lot of sense unless youre deeply into ""external sterilized interventions"" or ""dark pool outrhythms."" On the other hand its easy enough to compute a succession of car chases and several outbreaks of hand-to-hand combat. This is moviemaking in a modular mode an inspiration-free action adventure--with cheesy cinematography--that fills its modest running time by fitting together familiar elements into something reliably even insistently not new. WSJ film critic Joe Morgenstern tells us why he calls the film ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" ""uninspired"" and its cinematography ""Cheesy."" Photo Paramount. Jack himself has become a module a plug-and-play character previously embodied by Alec Baldwin Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck. In a spirit of industry-wide interchangeability Hollywoods new Captain Kirk has newly been plugged into the Ryan role. Mr. Pine is extremely likable in everything he does and thats certainly true here though hes unlikely to topple Daniel Craig or Matt Damon from their places in the tough-guy pantheon. In fact Jacks generally mild demeanor gets a wry acknowledgement at the very end just before he and his CIA mentor Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) meet the President of the United States. ""Any way"" Harper asks ""you can get that Boy-Scout-on-a-field-trip look off your face?"" No one will mistake the villain of the piece Viktor Cherevin for a Boy Scout. A Russian oligarch hes played by Kenneth Branagh who also directed with a comic-opera accent thats zestful for a while but then like the movie itself increasingly silly. Viktors villainy doesnt lack for ambition. Hes up to an assortment of dirty tricks that only Jack can detect and thwart including currency manipulation meant to plunge the United States into what Viktor foresees gleefully as ""the second Great Depression."" (One could argue that we almost pulled that off on our own.) The script is credited to Adam Cozad who has no prior script credits and David Koepp a veteran screen writer and rewriter. Its terribly clumsy and except for the frenzied action intractably abstract what with financial maneuverings on a global scale and digital Niagaras pouring down flat screens. (The silliest sequence of all takes place aboard a CIA plane where scores of analysts with data-sucking computers give Jack instant intel on an impending calamity.) Keira Knightley is Cathy Jacks fiancee. She has little to do apart from being confused about his true occupation and being in danger as a result of it. Recognizing this lapse the movie tries to rectify it albeit late in the game by allowing Cathy rather than Jack to identify a crucial photo as the office building he works in. Journey to the South Pacific Watch a clip from the IMAX film ""Journey to the South Pacific"" an underwater voyage to Indonesia to learn about its inhabitants as well as efforts being made in the region for ocean conservation. Narrated by Cate Blanchett. (Photo/Video IMAX) As the atmosphere warms and the oceans rise documentary filmmakers with an educational focus are facing the challenge of informing their audiences without discouraging them. ""Journey To the South Pacific"" an IMAX 3D production aimed at young people grafts a fictional story line onto spectacular documentary footage. The narrative details the accelerating loss of species diversity in recent decades the precipitous decline of big fish in fragile ocean ecologies and in particular the plight of the Pacific leatherback turtle an ancient creature facing imminent extinction. Mostly though the tone is upbeat. Its a story of kids learning how to make a difference in their own back yard which in this case is a group of islands within a marine park reserve in the remote Indonesian province of West Papua. ENLARGE A scene from Journey to the South Pacific IMAX Corporation/MacGillivray Freeman Films The film directed by Greg MacGillivray and narrated by Cate Blanchett explores its subject through the wide eyes of Jawi a 13-year-old who is charming without trying to be and who plays a mean ukulele. Jawi circumnavigates the reserve aboard the Kalabia a small vessel and floating classroom that in fact as well as in this fictional narrative spreads the conservation gospel among West Papuas children. He also dives--with no more gear than goggles and flippers--while the camera watches him and the otherworldly creatures that surround him. Im always delighted by the clarity and monumental proportions of IMAX films; this one lived up to my expectations. For openers its amazing that the water doesnt spill into the auditorium. Then theres the spectacle of the waters contents which need to be treasured and protected manta rays soaring and swooping like Matisse dancers; undulating battalions of rainbow-colored fish; tiny sea horses camouflaged perfectly although magnified by the IMAX lens into animals of impressive stature; flounder-like flatfish that resist the 3D process; a gathering of 40-foot whale sharks more comfortable with Jawis company than he is with theirs; and 500-pound leatherbacks mysteriously returned from the Oregon coast to the same stretch of beach where they were spawned. At times ""Journey To the South Pacific"" verges uncomfortably on merry-villager tropes--whole villages of kids running joyously to meet the boat while the music swells. But this is a film with a positive message thats delivered eloquently and whos to say that joyous purpose doesnt have its place? Ride Along Watch a clip from the film ""Ride Along."" Fast-talking security guard Ben (Kevin Hart) joins his cop brother-in-law James (Ice Cube) on a 24-hour patrol of Atlanta in order to prove himself worthy of marrying James sister. (Photo/Video Universal) By now moviegoers have learned to expect little from Hollywood in January; tis the season to be shoddy. Still ""Ride Along"" set in Atlanta gives shoddiness a bad name. Kevin Hart is Ben a rent-a-cop and childish nebbish in love with Tika Sumpters beautiful Angela. What she sees in him is unclear though he does have a good heart an amusing motor mouth and a gift for touching craziness. (What he sees in her is another matter since the wretched script hasnt even given Angela an occupation let alone a core personality.) To marry the couple needs the approval of her brother James a cop played by Ice Cube. James the very soul of disapproval insists that Ben prove himself by riding along with him on a 24-hour patrol. ENLARGE Kevin Hart left and Ice Cube in Ride Along Universal Pictures Theres comic potential in what becomes an extended hazing ritual (and what amounts as the script notes in passing to a riff on the excellent ""Training Day""). But Mr. Hart whose comedy regularly refers to his short stature has a role that comes up shorter than he does so he wears out his welcome with amiable banter that becomes incessant babble. And Ice Cube gives a charmless performance that substitutes declamatory anger for acting. The director was Tim Story who did the memorably exuberant ""Barber Shop"" a decade ago and the cast includes Laurence Fishburne. Whats he doing in a movie like this? Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Unstoppable (2010) Chris Pine is the rookie conductor and Denzel Washington is the veteran engineer in this terrific thriller directed by the late Tony Scott. The premise is simple to the point of primal -- a runaway freight train hurtling through Pennsylvania with a load of lethal chemicals and no one in the locomotive. On the same track heading toward it is another freight train pulled by a locomotive with the movies co-stars at the controls. The cast includes Rosario Dawson Kevin Corrigan and Ethan Suplee. Mark Bomback wrote the script. Ben Seresin did the sensational cinematography. ENLARGE Tropical Rainforest (1992) Ben Shedds superb documentary made for IMAX is available as Netflix streaming video. Thats a comedown but not a wipeout; the content remains intact. ""Imagine were travelers in time"" begins the films narrator the genially orotund Geoffrey Holder ""Its 400 million years ago."" The film shows us the growth of the rain forests matchless biological diversity and culminates in unprecedented destruction by contemporary loggers. ""Were just part of evolution"" the narrator says evenly ""no better than insects and no worse."" But we have foresight the film notes. ""The future is a time that we can change."" ENLARGE Three Kings (1999) Yes Ive recommended David O. Russells moral fable of the Gulf War many times but this time its for the extraordinarily nuanced performance by Ice Cube as Chief Elgin a committed Christian who confronted by a map that holds a promise of legendary wealth believes ""the good Lord has put this map in our path."" Most prominent in the cast are George Clooney Mark Wahlberg and Spike Jonze. In my initial review I said the film ""vaults David Russell to the first rank of contemporary filmmakers.""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Hollywood geopolitical thrillers set after the Cold War have two options go Middle Eastern or go retro evoking the USSR by picking a viable stand-in. Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit--the fourth attempt in 25 years at building a franchise around the titular Tom Clancy character--splits the difference. Its script which isnt based on a Clancy novel started as an Arab-world espionage thriller before being rewritten to accommodate a Cold War-nostalgia-friendly Russian setting. As a result the movie is an awkward amalgam of tropes from two different sub-genres with terrorist sleeper cells and gangster oligarchs operating side by side.A movie doesnt have to be original to be entertaining; surefooted direction can energize the most cliched material. Suspense however isnt Kenneth Branaghs strong suit. The actor-director who also plays Jack Ryans villain is fond of visual quirks (his last film Thor was chock full of canted angles) that create a patina of eccentricity but dont function in any meaningful way. Jack Ryan has a few of these oddball flourishes--a double lens flare which obscures everything else in the frame a hard dolly-in during a stabbing--but when it comes to the movies centerpiece scenes Branagh keeps things bland. The major action sequences--several car chases a shoot-out and a break-in at a high-tech skyscraper that probably seemed less out-of-place when the project was set in Dubai--are messy and uninvolving composed largely in disorienting telephoto-lens handheld shots. The more dialogue-heavy scenes stick to the familiar formula of a composed master shot followed by indifferently framed close-ups of whoever is doing the talking. The most egregious cliche of the genre--unnecessary explanatory text--pops up again and again informing viewers that the Statue Of Liberty is in New York City and Big Ben is in London. Yet its most insulting iteration comes early on when a scene set on September 11 2001 is followed by an explanatory intertitle--""2003 - 18 months later""--which seems to exist for the benefit of viewers who either cant do math or dont recall what year 9/11 happened.  Jack Ryans blandness is a shame because the film contains at least one sequence (the aforementioned skyscraper break-in) that could be thrilling in the right hands and two strong supporting performances from Branagh and Kevin Costner. The movie eventually evokes the sense that Branagh is better at directing in front of the camera than from behind it; its best moments are typically the ones that feature Branaghs Viktor Cherevin on-screen like the first meeting between Cherevin and Ryan (Chris Pine) which is set in an oversized office and composed in wide-angle shots that underscore the awkwardness of their interaction.In order to fit into a contemporary timeline Ryan--previously played by Alec Baldwin Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck--is reinvented as a post-9/11 enlistee and the helicopter crash that lead to his CIA career is relocated to Afghanistan. While recovering at the Walter Reed military hospital Ryan is approached by Thomas Harper (Costner; the character--original to this version of the story--is named after one of films producers) about going back to school to finish his economics degree so that he can become the CIAs inside man on Wall Street. This leads to the discovery of some suspicious accounts owned by Cherevin an assignment in Moscow and the discovery of a more-or-less nonsensical conspiracy to destroy the American economy. The movies by-the-numbers skullduggery is enlivened by the occasional turn of phrase (Cherevin on having also served in Afghanistan ""Different war different empire same graveyard"") and a few strange narrative details--like the idea that New Yorks Film Forum theater would serve as a CIA drop point--that smack of screenwriter David Koepp ( Jurassic Park Carlitos Way Panic Room the first Spider-Man). These small bits of dialogue and plotting are better at injecting personality into the film than any of Branaghs eccentric insert shots. Unfortunately they are few and far between.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com JACK RYAN Shadow Recruit Share Comment Does the name Jack Ryan sound familiar? Hes the super-CIA-guy hero of a bunch of best-selling techno-thrillers by the late Tom Clancy. As it happens ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" isnt adapted from any of the Clancy novels. In fact it didnt originate as a Jack Ryan story. Adam Cozads original script (he now shares writing credit with David Koepp) was called ""Dubai."" Now its mostly set in Moscow with stops along the way in London Afghanistan Washington D.C. New York and (sure why not) Dearborn Mich. Maybe all those alterations are why the movie feels so generic in its high-gloss big-budget way. ""Jack Ryan"" is slick loud assured overplotted (way overplotted) fairly diverting and pretty much empty. Full story for BostonGlobe.com subscribers.

JR-05209R Photo Larry Horricks Paramount Pictures Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit review Pine fine in reboot 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit Thriller. Starring Chris Pine Keira Knightley Kevin Costner and Kenneth Branagh. Directed by Kenneth Branagh. (PG-13. 105 minutes.) ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" doesnt have a Soviet submarine a nuked football stadium or Sean Connery in cinemas most resplendent beard. Instead of a drug lord in a fortified mountainside hacienda bank transactions and tense conversations push much of the action forward. But even with its thrifty set pieces and smaller ambitions this attempt to reboot the series based on Tom Clancy characters does the most important thing right It almost always feels like a Jack Ryan movie. At first glance Chris Pine seems miscast in the role. In previous work - most notably as James T. Kirk in the newer ""Star Trek"" movies - Pine thrives as a rogue who propels events with his arrogant instincts. Clancys Ryan character is anything but a fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants loose cannon. He has an academic mind making bold moves only after careful contemplation. Hes capable in a fight never comfortable. But under taut direction from Kenneth Branagh (who also plays the Russian heavy) Pine is convincing as a character who is pushing papers one day and dodging assassins in Moscow the next. One film into the series hes already vaulted past Ben Affleck as the third best Ryan and seems within striking distance of Alec Baldwin and Harrison ""How dare you sir"" Ford. The new Ryan film is the first not based on a Clancy book. It also has a filmed origin story which quickly separates itself from the time frame of the four previous movies. This Jack Ryan was pushed into military duty after the Sept. 11 attacks. After a crippling accident hes recruited by a CIA higher-up (Kevin Costner) who wants to use his analytic skills to fight terrorism. Watch ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" with a cynical eye and youll glimpse evidence that studio confidence might have waned. Adjusting for inflation this is the cheapest-looking Ryan movie. The lean 105-minute running time doesnt look voluntary. Like the much-tampered-with but still entertaining ""World War Z"" some recognizable actors are strangely reduced to cameos. But Branagh and the relay team of screenwriters involved with the project set an expert pace. Patrick Doyles pulse-quickening score is a huge asset especially when Ryan gets in one of his many think-quick-or-die jams. (If Doyles score accompanied a guy eating Fritos on the subway it still might be good for three minutes of harrowing tension.) ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" does make one critical mistake the casting of Keira Knightley as Ryans love interest and then thrusting her into the action in a thoroughly unconvincing way. Knightleys performance is Gwyneth Paltrow-esque offering the audience no good reason for Ryan to be in love with her then using her as a lazy plot device - only on the screen to suffer and be rescued. Perhaps knowing that older viewers will miss Ford Anne Archer and James Earl Jones we get a heaping dose of Costner. The actor oozes precision and confidence; under different circumstances he might have been the best Jack Ryan of all. Settle for the fact that Costner is being cast in every other big movie these days and is a welcome presence each time. A couple of more roles like this and his debt for making audiences sit through three hours of ""The Postman"" will finally be paid. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A deskbound CIA analyst uncovers an international terrorist plot. Rated PG-13 (action violence) BOTTOM LINE A boyish Pine is the freshest thing about this Tom Clancy reboot a dated Cold War thriller with villainous Russkies straight from the 1980s. Even Mikhail Baryshnikov is in it. CAST Chris Pine Kenneth Branagh Keira Knightley LENGTH 145 Much has changed since moviegoers last saw the action-prone CIA analyst Jack Ryan. Played by Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford in the 1990s then by Ben Affleck in 2002 Ryan kept pace with the worlds ever-evolving villains Soviet Russians Irish militants Colombian cartels. Hes back played by a fresh-faced Chris Pine (""Star Trek"") in the reboot ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit."" The question is who are the villains now? In the real world there are plenty to choose from. ""Jack Ryan"" directed by Kenneth Branagh opens with our hero at the London School of Economics where a broadcast of the 9/11 attacks convinces him to join the Marines. A missile ends Ryans service though it also results in a romance with his physical therapist Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley). When the CIA spook Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner cool and sardonic) comes calling Ryan balks at joining an agency known for waterboarding. But Harper dangles a desk job an undercover financial whiz on Wall Street.

Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? The Middle East the intelligence community the financial sector -- of all the places to ferret out evildoers would you believe that ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" goes back to the well of good old Russia? And not the modern country but a 1984 version where the Prime Minister (Mikhail Baryshnikov no less) conspires with the ruthless tycoon Viktor Cherevin (Branagh himself) to bomb America and crash its economy. ""We will avenge our Mother Russia"" Cherevin hisses. ""America will bleed"" Is any contemporary viewer interested in this tattered Cold War document? Everything about ""Jack Ryan"" feels woefully dated from Branaghs Bond-style villain to the routine script by Adam Cozad and David Koepp (not based on any Clancy novel). After the moral ambiguities of ""Zero Dark Thirty"" and the expanded global perspective of ""Captain Phillips"" the safe retreat of ""Jack Ryan"" into yesterdays bomb bunker seems beneath even an escapist thriller. Pine brings a welcome boyishness and idealism to Ryan but hes clobbered with cliches by his director and screenwriters. The evildoers it turns out were right in his own backyard. 225 MoviesJack Ryan Shadow Recruit trailer PLOT A deskbound CIA analyst uncovers an international terrorist plot. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (action violence) CAST Chris Pine Kenneth Branagh Keira Knightley LENGTH 145 BOTTOM LINE A boyish Pine is the freshest thing about this Tom Clancy reboot a dated Cold War thriller with villainous Russkies straight from the 1980s.

PEARL HARBOR (2001) -- It bombed with critics but this World War II actioner featuring Baldwin as Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle and Affleck (""The Sum of All Fears"") as a hotshot pilot under his command raked in more than 449 million globally.

Thats the damn problem. Despite a timely spy plot with Russian baddies trying to crash the U.S. economy via the Internet and terrorist attack lots of glam globetrotting through Moscow London and New York and a studly digital-savvy hero in Chris Pine the movie feels deballed by its allegiance to formula. Are we not entertained? Sure we are. Class-act director Kenneth Branagh happily slumming again as he did with Thor wants us to share in his amusement. But his movie never really busts loose. Its not built that way. More News 2013s Best Movies All Stories >> Whos to blame? In Hollywood-speak to boldly go where no movie has gone before is fucked-up box-office thinking. Reboots are where the money is. If you want to jump-start a moribund franchise cast it young and hot and go with an origin story. Look what Pine did as Captain Kirk in the revived Star Trek series. Pine is at it again in Shadow Recruit playing the CIA analyst featured in 13 bestsellers by the late Tom Clancy and four hit movies. Three stars have already had a crack at Jack Alec Baldwin in 1990s The Hunt for Red October Harrison Ford in 1992s Patriot Games and 1994s Clear and Present Danger and Ben Affleck in 2002s The Sum of All Fears. But 12 years is a long time between gigs. Is there any juice left for an actor to squeeze out of the character? Pine does his damnedest finding the conflicted core of a brainiac who feels out of his element when the call comes for action. Screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp veer away from Clancys novels to fill in the blanks on Jack and give the character a modern backstory. We meet our college-age hero at the London School of Economics where he lazes under a tree with his books until news of 9/11 rouses his patriotic fervor. He nearly loses his leg after a heroic stand in Afghanistan but American medical student Cathy (Keira Knightley trying very hard not to sound British) helps him get his energy up. Other things too. Enter Kevin Costner nicely underplaying the can-do brio of Harper the CIA agent who recruits Jack as a covert operative on Wall Street. Thats where Jack discovers the dastardly scheme of Russian mastermind Viktor Cherevin (Branagh himself) to achieve world domination for Russia. Branagh looking and sounding like the thin-lipped malicious Laurence Olivier in Marathon Man has a ball. Viktors dinner-table come-on to Cathy exposing his weaknesses for vodka vanity and women has an elegant bite that seems to come from a more intriguing movie. Dont worry. Its not for long. When Jack and Cathy quarrel Harper cuts them dead ""This is geopolitics not couples therapy."" Branagh the director makes sure that Jack Ryan the character and the movie soon gets back to hardass business. Jacks fight with an assassin in a Moscow hotel room has the punch of a James Bond film. And an extended sequence of Jack trying to get in and out of Viktors fortress without detection could be right out of the Mission Impossible franchise. Thats the disturbing point. Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit has no personality of its own. Its a product constructed out of spare parts and assembled with computerized precision. Its hard to care when Jack turns operational and becomes a CIA robocop. The movie feels untouched by human hands.

Grade B- In this contemporary espionage fantasy nice guys finish first. Thats the most engaging aspect of the slam-bam Jack Ryan reboot that introduces Chris Pine to the role of the brilliant two-fisted CIA analyst. After so many Jason Bourne clones (in movies and TV) - robotic super-soldiers who must rediscover their hearts - its refreshing to get reacquainted with an old-fashioned patriot who refuses to lose his humanity while fighting a good fight. The opening is swift and crude. The filmmakers set up Ryans ""origin story"" as if dropping cartoon building blocks on the audiences heads. BANG Ryan halts his studies at the London School of Economics as soon as 9/11 happens. OOOF He joins the Marines and gets shot out of the sky in Afghanistan saving two survivors from their shattered helicopter despite breaking his own back. AWWW He meets his true love Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley) when shes a third-year medical student at Walter Reade in charge of his physical therapy. By the time Kevin Costner enters the picture as William Harper who recruits Jack as an analyst his naturalness confidence and ease are a relief to the audience and possibly to Ryan - especially after Harper assures the young hero that his CIA unit doesnt do water-boarding or renditions. In a rare sunny (if shallow) view of Wall Street Ryan completes his Ph.D. and takes a cover job as the compliance officer for a financial services firm. Staying true to the equally smitten Cathy (they share an apartment) hes living the sweet high life of a good man on the way up. Then he uncovers a Russian plot to combine terrorism and economic sabotage and put an end to Americas reign as a superpower. Ryan must turn field agent to confront the schemes ruthless Muscovite kingpin Victor Cherevin. Kenneth Branagh (who also directed) plays Cherevin with a baroque panache that balances Costners dry wit. The movie benefits from sly comic undercurrents when Ryan is with either of these wily veterans. They pull off riffs on innocence and experience in which all the actors win. Pine wisely plays Ryan as if he knows he cant compete with the pent-up rage and intellectual precision of Branaghs Cherevin. So Ryans never-say-die spunk becomes funny and appealing notably when he comes up short in the aphorism department. Costners Harper says he hopes Ryan never loses his ""Boy Scout on a field trip"" look. You know exactly what he means. Too frequently the film descends into cluttered action including a ""shocking"" piece of hand-to-hand combat that defies the storys logic. The car chases emphasize headlong motion over clarity momentum and suspense. The filmmakers (including Adam Cozad and David Koepp who wrote the script) put the fate of the world up for grabs and then make the action pivot on jammed traffic and vehicular mayhem. You glimpse a better film that might have been in a pivotal dinner scene that melds espionage tradecraft and drawing room comedy. After a rocky start Knightley displays all her soulful flashing beauty when Cathy distracts Cherevin with her sympathy for the tormented Russian spirit. (Knightley can talk about Lermontovs ""A Hero of Our Time"" as if shes actually read it.) Branagh bristles with sexual tension conveying why Cherevin is notorious for three linked vices ""vodka vanity and women."" Best of all Ryan pretends in that one scene that hes really a misogynistic jerk. Though weve known him for little more than an hour Pine allows us to savor the tangy charade of his uncouth rowdiness. The movie is too superficial for any serious talk of ""character."" But Pine and company manage to pepper it with personality.

Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit Year 2014 Director Kenneth Branagh Actors Chris Pine Kevin Costner Keira Knightley Kenneth Branagh Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The next time you meet a solemn guy who either asks you a lot of personal questions or wont answer yours just say ""What do you do for a living?"" If hes in the CIA hell reply ""Im in the CIA."" That anyway is the tactic of frankness that intelligence boss Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) uses on ex-Marine Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) which Jack later deploys on his suspicious fiancee Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley). ""Thank God"" she exclaims. ""I thought you were having an affair."" This isnt Carrie Mathisons CIA but then Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit isnt Homeland. Director Kenneth Branagh serves up an oldfangled espionage yarn Tom Clancy-style in which the agency is not corrupt and clueless but noble and efficient and the Russians -- particularly the satanic banker Victor Cherevin (played by Branagh) -- are back in fashion as the reliable bad guys. This time of year thats a good thing. Amid the January leftovers of anodyne action pictures (The Legend of Hercules) subordinary cop comedies (Ride Along) and horror franchises on autopilot (Paranormal Activity The Marked Ones) a reboot of an A-level spy series seems too pretty-good to be true. Shadow Recruit occupies this weekends movie screens as familiarly and reassuringly as a Walther PPK fits in the hand of James Bond. (MORE 50 Years of James Bond movies) Jack -- played in earlier decades by Alec Baldwin (The Hunt for Red October) Harrison Ford (Patriot Games Clear and Present Danger) and Ben Affleck (The Sum of All Fears) -- isnt yet a mature 007 type. This is an origins story and the script by Adam Cozad and Davis Koepp hews faithfully to Clancys sketching of Jacks early life a college-bred Marine injured in a helicopter crash he eventually works undercover as a compliance officer at a Wall Street brokerage. (He doesnt tell everyone hes in the CIA.) Like the ""reader"" played by Robert Redford in the 1975 Three Days of the Condor hes an analyst searching for encrypted mischief. The Redford character pored over Russian books and magazines; Jack who studied at the London School of Economics scans the computer screen for stock transactions that may be connected to terrorists. (READ Colin Powell on Tom Clancy) A trail of suspicious investments made by Cherevin leads Jack to more active work in Moscow. On his arrival he survives a murder attempt by Cherevins Ugandan henchman (Nonse Anozie of Game of Thrones and Enders Game) -- an African avatar of Oddjob from Goldfinger but with a gun instead of a steel-rimmed bowler -- and dodges bullets and killer cars for the rest of his stay. Still new at a game he wasnt trained for Jack gets backup from Harper his agency control and a dozen or so computer whizzes who type very fast to sleuth a saboteurs secrets. When he returns to the U.S.A. its different. If you think anyone but Young Blue Eyes will be going solo to save some prime Lower Manhattan real estate from being blown up (again -- thanks Hollywood) then you dont know Jack. In 1989 Branagh a theater prodigy who was often tagged as the next Olivier followed Lord Larrys example by directing and starring in a film of Henry V. It earned him Oscar nominations in both categories. The same year Costner was offered the Jack Ryan role in Red October but declined so he could concentrate on his own directing debut Dances With Wolves; that won Best Picture and Director plus an acting nomination. Twenty-five years later the two former phenoms are vacationing together in Shadow Recruit. (READ TIMEs 1989 Kevin Costner cover story) Costner wears his age well (hell be 59 on Jan. 18) and retains the stars gift of seeming both alert and relaxed. His Walker is the CIA ideal smooth tough an unerring shot and a terse parrier of Jacks questions about waterboarding and rendition. (""Not my unit."") Branagh who in the movie looks like an older nasty Jason Bateman flashes a creepy Slavic charm when hes not jackbooting subordinates or stuffing an LED lightbulb in a ladys mouth. (Dont try this at home kids; its apparently lethal.) Strictly speaking Cherevin is freelance not a member of Putins spy service. But hes the sort of ruthless schemer who put the cagey in the KGB. (READ TIMEs 1989 Kenneth Branagh story) Both men are mentoring or babysitting Pine whose resume basically comprises two turns as James Kirk in the Star Trek revival and a ride on the Unstoppable train with Denzel Washington. Pine is 33 a year older than Baldwin when he played Jack Ryan and no dummy as his English degree from the University of California Berkeley should attest. Yet he plays many scenes with the wide eyes of a child who (happy look) got the Christmas present he wanted or (wounded look) didnt make the chess team. If Pine is to keep playing Jack Ryan -- who in the Clancy cosmology eventually served two nonconsecutive terms as President of the United States --  hed better learn to play grownup. (READ Corlisss review of Star Trek Into Darkness) As a director Branagh hasnt gotten noticeably fancier or gone senile; he plows ahead with efficiency and the crafty managing of actors (including himself). His helming of the first Thor movie which was on the starchy side when up in Asgard came alive in the more realistic scenes on Earth. Realism was the intent here Branagh has said. The picture was shot in 35-mm anamorphic the standard back in Three Days of the Condor days and is deglamorized enough to show its leading mans pocked skin and its leading ladys crooked teeth. Knightley (sporting an American accent thats a little too careful to be persuasive) plays the sort of gumptious gal wholl show up unannounced in the Moscow hotel room where Jack just had to drown an assassin in the bathtub. (READ Robert Redford on Three Days of the Condor director Sydney Pollack by subscribing to TIME) Hollywood realism is to realism as reality TV shows are to reality the truth jazzed up into pop fiction. If Branaghs realism is meant to evoke Condor and The Parallax View it must also incorporate such spy-movie implausibilities as the villain who threatens to do some awful thing just long enough for the hero to show up and stop it. Still and all consider the January competition and praise Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit for being the years first movie with a three-digit IQ.

"Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit 3 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit 3 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED NEWS Best Kenneth Branagh films By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Jan 16 2014 1126 AM It says something about Chris Pines performance in ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" the latest film about Tom Clancys CIA-analyst hero that you dont spend much time wondering whether he grows up to be Harrison Ford Alec Baldwin or Ben Affleck. Those are the actors who also have played Ryan over the years. Pine who knows a thing or two about taking over roles from established actors (Beam him up Scotty) proves a perfectly capable if somewhat generic Ryan. In fact capable if generic describes the movie pretty well. Kenneth Branagh who may seem like an odd choice for directing an action movie until you remember he directed ""Thor"" keeps things moving building suspense at the right times. But he never manages anything truly revelatory; this all is a version of things weve seen before. Ryan is studying for his doctorate at the London School of Economics when the 9/11 attacks occur. (Yes this is kind of an origin story but its set in the present so perhaps ""reboot"" is a more accurate way of looking at it.) Hes inspired to join the Marines and volunteers for a dangerous mission in Afghanistan. His helicopter is shot down and hes badly wounded. Hes helped in rehab by Cathy (Keira Knightley) a doctor to whom he is attracted. And hes approached by Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) a CIA operative who makes that clear to Ryan during their first meeting. Harper wants Ryan to finish his degree and become an analyst for the CIA. Ten years later he is just that working undercover on Wall Street looking for terrorist money. He also is living with Cathy who hasnt a clue about his real job but suspects theres more to his life than she knows. Ryan finds some suspicious activity by a Russian client so he heads to Moscow to investigate. Hes attacked almost immediately but instantly shows unusual self-defense talents for a guy whose action has been limited to crunching numbers on a computer for the last few years. Those sorts of discrepancies pop up here and there in ""Shadow Recruit."" But Branagh soldiers on which probably is a good thing. Ryan may be smart but that doesnt mean the script has to be. Branagh plays Viktor Cherevin who owns the Russian company under suspicion. Hes bad to the core bitter about the CIAs involvement when the Soviet Union was fighting its own war with Afghanistan and he has much bigger and more nefarious plans than Ryan and Harper originally realize. Cathy shows up in Moscow to surprise Ryan and becomes embroiled in the plot. Theres a nice scene set at a swank restaurant where she has to distract Cherevin while Ryan sneaks into his office to steal data. Branagh as actor hams it up while Branagh as director does a good job juxtaposing the flirtatious banter with Ryans race to get at Cherevins computer. Its tense and satisfying. Again though its the kind of thing weve seen before. And weve certainly seen Jack Ryan before if not this specific edition. ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" is a well-made movie well-acted (Costner and Branagh seem to be having an especially good time) and a pleasant diversion. Theyll probably make several more. But it doesnt exactly put the ""thrill"" in action thriller. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday January 16 2014 118 PM Title Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit Film Info PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. Jack Ryan is a character who has survived hopscotch casting. Tom Clancys CIA analyst hero has been played with varying results by Alec Baldwin in ""The Hunt for Red October"" Harrison Ford in ""Clear and Present Danger"" and ""Patriot Games"" and Ben Affleck in ""The Sum of All Fears."" Now its time for ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" starring Chris Pine who has already been Captain Kirk in the latest round of ""Star Trek"" movies. So for Pine and us this is par for the course. You know what youre in for as you walk into the theater. Indeed director Kenneth Branaghs movie is a pretty standard-issue reboot. Like ""Casino Royale"" ""Shadow Recruit"" is set in the present while envisioning its well-known protagonist as a newbie. Pines Ryan is introduced as a London School of Economics student on the day the twin towers fell. Jack Ryan (Chris Pine l.) is recruited for the CIA by naval officer Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) in ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit."" Inspired to serve in Afghanistan Ryan is seriously wounded during a helicopter mortar attack in 2003. Recovering from his spine and leg injuries at Walter Reed hospital the tactician soldier catches the eye of a pretty doctor (Keira Knightley) and impresses Thomas Harper (Kevin Costner) a naval officer recruiting for the CIA. Ryans deft analyses of patterns and threats earns him his spy-guy badge. Ten years later armed with a higher degree Ryan has a gig in New York as a CIA mole looking for terrorists financial footprints. His so-called ""desk job"" is interrupted when he spots something sneaky in Russian stock trades. Turns out that a sadistic Kremlin insider (played by Branagh) hopes to bring the U.S. economy down just before an embedded operative sets off a bomb in Lower Manhattan. Its up to Ryan and Harper to stop the attack. Kenneth Branagh who also directed the movie co-stars in ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" playing a Kremlin insider hoping to bring down the U.S. economy. Thats all numbingly familiar from other thrillers and while it leads to a few good chases theres also a dull mid-film scene of urgent data encryption. But the script by genre master David Koepp -- credited with Adam Cozad -- has a pleasing symmetry (Ryans cross-globe mission leads him back to Wall Street). And the film certainly makes up in verve what it lacks in imagination. Branagh taking advantage of his experience helming 2011s ""Thor"" shows an allegiance to the genre hes working in; both as director and co-star he pours on the menace. And while Knightleys American accent sounds too Valley Girl Costner is a steadying force. Keira Knightley plays a doctor who gets involved with Ryan in ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit."" Baldwins interpretation of Ryan remains the best yet Pine for what he does doesnt drop the ball. He needs though to get more original characters on his resume or risk looking like a human restart button. Bumped from its Christmastime release date ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" arrives in the shadow of the Oscar-season films. Thankfully this thriller has found a safe house in movie Siberia better known by its code name -- January. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Branagh plays a heroin-addicted Russian terrorist in this routine franchise reboot and when hes at dinner in Moscow with Ryans fiancee played by Keira Knightley hes being duped into believing hes making meaningful progress in the sniveling-seduction department.Then he gets word via text that its all a setup. Chris Pine plays the CIA analyst portrayed in previous films by Alec Baldwin Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck and Pines Ryan is ransacking the terrorists files digitally elsewhere while putting the fiancee at risk. (That old plot development again.) Once he learns of the deception Branagh fixes Knightley with his best cruelest tightest-lipped Laurence Olivier stare. And because Branagh is directing the scene as well as playing in it he allows the camera to take an extra second or two to register the moment before getting back to the workmanlike film at hand. ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" has plenty of action almost all of it staged and edited in the manner of a Paul Greengrass ""Bourne"" movie (hand-held frenzy without the Greengrass spatial clarity). This is a Jack Ryan prequel introducing our hero as an American grad student at the London School of Economics driven to serve as a Marine once 9/11 changes the course of modern history. Two years later his helicopter is shot down over Afghanistan. In rehab at Walter Reed medical center back home he meets the doctor (Knightley doing her flattest nowhere-in-particular American dialect) who helps him get into action-hero shape for the rest of the picture.The middle of the film the Moscow portion works best. Kevin Costner settles comfortably into a rumpled authority figure role as Ryans overseer who always has his boys back. Frustratingly though the screenplay by Adam Cozad and David Koepp devolves into scenes of Ryan solving a ridiculous number of riddles in record time while tracking a different related terrorist and thwarting a heinous attack on our home soil. The action climax a mess of vehicular near-homicides and hand-to-hand brutalities reminds you that Branagh (though he did well enough with the first ""Thor"" picture) hasnt much facility for high-velocity violence. Hes more into the quiet nasty bits. ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" well acted up and down feels caught halfway between being an idiotic spy picture for adolescents and a reasonably grown-up thriller for reasonably grown-up grown-ups. The latter isnt the target demographic for the average franchise re-launch. But thats what the film is at heart an average franchise re-launch.mjphillipstribune.com""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" - 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of violence and intense action and brief strong language)Running time 145Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Kenneth Branagh Keira Knightley Paul Greengrass Chris Pine David Koepp Latest movie reviews REVIEW Ride Along  REVIEW Big Bad Wolves  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising70deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/chi-jack-ryan-shadow-recruit-0117-20140116,0,6820120.column",200,jackryanshadowrecruit24,jackryanshadowrecruit,chicagotribune

And since Jack Ryan the hero of many such successful tomes by the late Tom Clancy gets a big-screen reboot in ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" it will come as no surprise that both of those ingredients come into play. And even if ""Shadow Recruit"" isnt up to the recent highs of the 007 series its a zippy and exciting little cloak and dagger tale thats entertaining enough to make a new Ryan franchise seem like something worth anticipating. We meet this version of the character -- played by Chris Pine and on the heels of his contributions to the rebooted ""Star Trek"" movies we can officially classify him as Hollywoods go-to Mr. Do-Over -- working on a PhD in Economics in London when the attacks of September 11 2001 take place. (Director Kenneth Branagh uses just enough news footage to make the event essential to the plot without showing so much carnage as to be exploitative.) A year and a half later Lt. Jack Ryan is flying in a helicopter over Afghanistan when hes shot out of the sky and gravely injured. Stateside Ryan recovers at Walter Reed where he meets two essential people Cathy (Keira Knightley with an endearingly gawky American accent) the medical student who pushes the wounded Marine through physical therapy and Harper (Kevin Costner) who recruits Ryan into the Central Intelligence Agency. Also read Chris Pine Discovers Very Scary Terrorist Plot in Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit Trailer (Video) Harper wants Ryan to return to school get his doctorate and then go to work on Wall Street looking for the money that funds terrorist groups. Jump to a decade or so later when Ryan finds just that with a Russian firm occluding its accounts just as the U.S. (and the UN) approve a Turkish oil pipeline over Russias protests. Hiding his secret government gig from Cathy now his girlfriend but not yet his wife Ryan heads to Moscow to dig deeper bringing him face to face with steely-eyed financier Cheravin (Branagh entertainingly hammy) whos clearly been cooking up something diabolical with a stone-faced higher-up (an uncredited Mikhail Baryshnikov) at the Kremlin. Also read Jack Ryan Starring Chris Pine Scores IMAX Release All of which leads to lots of spy stuff and Ryans first kill and a break-in at a big glass skyscraper thats right out of the Shanghai sequence of ""Skyfall"" and a kidnapping and lots of chasing and even an explosion or two. (Good thing since the dots in Adam Kozad and David Koepps script are frequently tricky to connect.) Branagh to his credit gets more right than wrong with this kind of globe-trotting action big moments like Ryan breaking into and then sneaking out of Cheravins office as Harper keeps tabs from afar feel tense and exciting while the more close-up stuff -- the helicopter crash in Afghanistan a hand-to-hand fight in the back of a van -- tends to be shot and edited in confuse-o-vision. The character of Ryan has always been a tricky balance; you have to believe him in a knife fight and you also have to buy him as someone who turned in a lengthy report about statistical averages but Pine makes both halves convincing. He brings the physicality of James T. Kirk and the charismatic wonkishness he brought to the Los Angeles stage production of ""Farragut North"" playing the character that Ryan Gosling would portray in the film version ""The Ides of March."" Also read Tom Clancy Hunt for Red October Author Dead at 66 Knightley gets to be more than just The Girl here and Costner seems to have finally made the transition from the hero to the mysterious man on the park bench whos got all the answers. These three leads click well and if the franchise gods smile down on them theyll presumably get chased through more foreign capitals in any number of sequels.

And two decades have elapsed since Ford played the character created by Tom Clancy in Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger.Shadow Recruit is ostensibly the prequel to the espionage thriller series though its set in present day which is confusing on its face. But Hollywood loves a franchise re-boot so presumably this will kick off another series of Clancy revamps. Surely there must be fresher literary characters to plunder.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersKenneth Branagh directs and stars as a Russian villain making the viewer wish hed stuck to his Shakespearean roots. Instead his efforts are hampered by inferior writing and formulaic action scenes like car chases a climactic ticking time bomb and threatening banter that passes for witty repartee between villain and hero.The movie opens with Ryan as a student at the London School of Economics when he hears about the 9/11 World Trade Center attack. He enlists in the Marines and takes a dangerous assignment in Afghanistan. After his chopper crashes he winds up in a hospital badly wounded. Re-learning to walk he meets Cathy (Keira Knightley) a medical student who is his physical therapist. Romance brews. While hes recovering hes recruited by William Harper (Kevin Costner) a CIA operative.Initially Ryan feebly resists the overture ""People dont like you much these days"" he says citing CIA tactics like waterboarding and rendition. But his twinge of conscience doesnt keep him from taking the bait.Flash forward 10 years. Ryans working on Wall Street. But hes actually a covert analyst in the financial intelligence division of the agency looking for terrorists moving money.He lives with Cathy now a doctor. She has no idea what he really does for a living though shes vaguely suspicious.When Ryan uncovers some questionable data hes quickly dispatched to dig deeper into it tracing it to Moscow.There he meets the megalomaniac Viktor Cherevin (Branagh) a heavy-drinking womanizer and mastermind of a nefarious plot to collapse the U.S. economy. Russians have become such ubiquitous go-to villains that the story feels particularly tired.The film is slow in getting started and once its underway its only intermittently involving. Its also occasionally far-fetched. Why is Jack the only person capable of facing the dangerous Cherevin? How does he overpower a hit man built like a refrigerator?The writing is strangely uneven. At times it tries to be a contemporary political thriller with something to say about how the CIA handles matters. Mostly its just cliched. ""There will be riots and famines and bread lines"" predicts Ryan.But in the next sentence he whines to Harper ""You sold this as an office job"" and ""Im just an analyst. Im out of my element.""Harpers response ""Youre not just an analyst anymore. Youre operational now.""This acknowledgement of his spy status is met with swelling musical strains.Still Pine seems a good fit for the role and Knightley does her best to enliven a rather lackluster part. Unfortunately the script they work from is full of plot holes and implausibilities.Its the actors misfortune that the film theyre starring in is more shallow than shadowy. 6 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/KjZPve",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/01/15/jack-ryan-shadow-recruit-review/4272211/,200,jackryanshadowrecruit27,jackryanshadowrecruit,usatoday

(Larry Horricks) B- Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Kenneth Branagh Kevin Costner Keira Knightley Chris Pine; Director Kenneth Branagh; Release Date Wide 01/17/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 105; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted January 27 2014 -- 1200 AM EST Jack Ryan the superstar CIA analyst created 30 years ago by Tom Clancy is now in his fifth motion picture with a fourth actor playing him. Im more than happy to see Chris Pine so good as the hot-dog rebel Captain Kirk in the Star Trek films take a whack at portraying a character previously embodied by Alec Baldwin Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck -- even if Pine with his wolfish crystal-blue-eyed sensuality (hes like the American Jonathan Rhys Meyers) comes off as more of a lover than a fighter. Yet given this revolving door of actors and considering that the Ryan character is pretty much a Cold War relic to begin with is it any wonder that you may now have almost no idea what defines him? Ryan isnt an addled badass like Jason Bourne or an icy-sexy megaspy like James Bond or a master-of-illusion daredevil like the hero of the Mission Impossible films. Almost nothing about him is distinctive. In the pulsating but colorless Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit he gets into fistfights and car chases downloads information from computers and skulks around looking tense and concerned. He might as well be called Generic Agent Guy. The movie is -- surprise -- a franchise reboot (there hasnt been one of those in at least three weeks) and it rather awkwardly tries to jam Clancys USA-vs.-the-Russkies paranoia into a post-9/11 world. Ryan starts off as a soldier in Afghanistan in 2003 where after being injured in a helicopter attack he catches the eye of a winkingly imperious CIA officer (Kevin Costner). A decade later Ryan has been installed as an agency mole on Wall Street. His snooping leads him to Moscow where he uncovers a plot to drain the dollar of its value and launch a targeted attack on U.S. soil so that it will look like said attack was responsible. Can you say big yawn? The Bourne films have accustomed us to highly layered espionage plots but in Shadow Recruit theres just a lone old-school Russian bad guy. His name is Viktor Cherevin and as played by Kenneth Branagh (who also directed) hes a gimlet-eyed oligarch with scary arm tattoos a heroin habit and one measly ""master plan."" In the centerpiece sequence Jack and his fiancee Cathy (Keira Knightley) -- who has just learned hes in the CIA -- go to dinner with Cherevin and trick him into letting his guard down. The idea is that hell be seduced by the attentions of the beautiful Cathy so that Jack can then slip away and sneak into the lair where Cherevin keeps his computer files. Its the most tense sequence in the film yet even as youre enjoying it youre thinking How corny If Cherevin is such a formidable foe how can he possibly get sucked in by this flimsy charade? Branagh did a nice job of directing Thor but all he can do here is try to energize the recycled pulp of the script. Costner is in fine dry form Knightley is at her most open and gorgeous and Pine goes through the motions of saving the Western world with a swaggery concentration that keeps you watching. I just hope that in the next Ryan outing his charisma will have the added sheen that comes with being at least one step ahead of the audience.

Running time 106 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence profanity). At the E-Walk the Kips Bay the Orpheum others. In ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" we learn that Greenwich Villages lefty haven Film Forum is the favorite place in town for CIA agents to swap files which is as I always suspected. Next well hear about how Rumsfeld and Cheney plotted the Iraq War from the restrooms at CBGB and its well known that Henry Kissinger frequented Studio 54 which is where he and Cher first got the idea to manufacture the oil crisis. Despite the occasional hard-to-believe moment the reboot of the 1990s franchise (later doomed by Ben Affleck before the next ""Batman"" turns him into a serial franchise killer) is soundly structured smart and fast with a plausible central scenario several gripping moments and well-wrought dialogue. If it isnt quite as gritty or intelligent as the Bourne movies it is -- as Ryan responds when asked if hes still ""intact"" after nearly taking a few unexpected bullets -- close enough. ""Jack Ryan"" is also -- a major point of relief with me -- considerably less frivolous than most of the Bond and ""Mission Impossible"" films about what it might be like to be an international man of mystery. If the star can brush everything off without even unknotting his tie and crack jokes as he goes so much for intensity. And Chris Pine is much less blockish here than in ""Star Trek"" with his callow quality serving him well as an often-terrified newbie economics Ph.D. and ex-Marine combatant recruited by a CIA operative (Kevin Costner) to follow terrorisms money trail while undercover at a Wall Street firm. Under pressure Pine gets red-faced and sweats instead of quips as his investigation of Russian banking transactions leads him to a cold-blooded Moscow financier (a chilling Kenneth Branagh also the films director) who is engineering a simultaneous 9/11-style bombing and financial attack. Jacks girlfriend Cathy (Keira Knightley) the doctor who helped him recover after he was nearly killed fighting in Afghanistan thinks hes having an affair when she finds that Film Forum ticket stub and declines to marry him out of general suspicion -- but he cant tell anyone but his spouse about his secret life so she cant know. Even when she finds a firearm in his room though she considers that evidence of cheating which seems obtuse in a feminine way Honey your man needs only one pistol to fool around not two. Knightley though occasionally annoying (her patented gape-smile is getting old) anchors perhaps the best scene in the movie when having been drawn into the plot she must divert Branaghs Cherevin by talking about Russian literature while her boyfriend downloads every villainous file from the evil mainframe. Shes a doctor not a kickboxer and the movie doesnt burn off credibility by giving her ridiculous stunts while the tender moments with Jack lay down a solid foundation for him to risk it all and tear after her in one of the admirably few but potent action scenes. Keeping things nimble and clever (the financial scam makes scary sense and how many blockbusters seamlessly work in themes from novelist Mikhail Lermontov?) brings the director total redemption after the unfortunate nearly campy ""Thor."" Branagh that recovering Shakespearean now looks like a reliable hand at le cinema du popcorn. Equal credit goes to the script -- based on Tom Clancys characters -- by newcomer Adam Cozad and veteran David Koepp (""Jurassic Park""). An exchange worthy of John le Carre comes when Jack mentions he hurt his back in Afghanistan and Cherevin says icily ""Me too."" Two words tie together two eras and make clear why Cherevin hates America for its support of the rebels during the Soviet invasion. Perhaps an even better line is the Costner characters response to Ryans mildly insane (but perfectly correct) series of computations that lead to the conclusion that theres a sleeper agent in Pennsylvania. Nah says Costner ""Nobody blows up Pennsylvania.""

""The actor drops his winking bravura and shows a more vulnerable side"" writes Us Weeklys film critic Mara Reinstein Credit Paramount Pictures In theaters Friday Jan. 17 3 stars (out of 4 stars) ""Im out of my goddamn element"" Wall Street analyst and new secret agent Jack Ryan (Chris Pine) exclaims to his superiors after executing his first kill. Ah but that quality is precisely what makes the character an action hero for the ages. Still hes been absent from the big screen for 12 years. (Ben Affleck last brought him to life in 2002s Sum of All Fears). Now he returns in a quick-footed reboot that does its duty as an escape from the January doldrums. PHOTOS Best movies of 2012 Lets put aside his onscreen brushes with Red October and the Irish Republican Army and start at the beginning. Young Ryan is a brilliant Phd candidate when he gives up his studies to join the Marines in the wake of 9/11. During his tour of duty he saves lives in a helicopter crash that nearly paralyzes him. Thanks to that combination of smarts and guts hes recruited to join the CIA. The plan is for him to work as a financial analyst and keep a lookout for any transactions that might link to international terrorist cells. Ryan soon deduces that the Russians are conspiring to sink the economy and carry out an attack on U.S. soil. Next stop Moscow. PHOTOS Summer movie guide In terms of espionage plotting this is admittedly boilerplate material -- and its nothing audiences havent already been seen in the various Bourne and Mission Impossible movies. But that doesnt make a chase around the Kremlin or the tricky double crosses any less gripping. The film also pulls off a nifty sequence in which Ryan and his team lifts the wallet of the smooth terrorist mastermind (Kenneth Branagh also the films director) right from under him and uses the security card to access files. Granted Ryan is amazingly nimble for a wounded vet who could barely walk two paces in physical rehab. Go with it. Weve come this far. PHOTOS Stars as super heroes Besides Ryan still has his emotional setbacks. This is a guy whos so uneasy as a super-spy that his hands shake after one mission. And the immensely appealing Pine -- in a role also previously played by heavyweights Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford -- is up to the challenge. For the first time in his career the actor drops his winking bravura and shows a more vulnerable side. He even sells the hackneyed too-cute romance with a doctor. (Poor Keira Knightley is mired in a thankless role that requires her to throw her arms around her fiance and bellow ""Thank god I thought you were having an affair"" upon learning of his CIA job. Really?). For the next installment Ryan should just keep those blue eyes on the job. And yes there kind of needs to be a next installment.

Daily Edition Login to download Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit Film Review 200 AM PST 1/15/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Clancys man is back for the Cold War 2.0. TWITTER Chris Pine stars as the eponymous CIA agent in Paramounts reboot of the Tom Clancy spycraft franchise. Tom Clancy re-heats the Cold War from the grave in Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit a streamlined reboot of a 1990s-rooted Paramount franchise in which the United States is saved from another 9/11-sized catastrophe altogether too easily. As the fourth actor to portray the title character in a five-film series thus far Chris Pine adequately follows in the footsteps of Alec Baldwin Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck in what also amounts to an origins story about the characters trial by fire in the CIA. Commercial prospects look solid if not spectacular for this efficient if ultimately rote political thriller. PHOTOS Exclusive Portraits of the New Jack Ryan While it benefits from an attractive cast the perennial allure of the spy game and the exoticism of the contemporary Moscow setting the biggest problem afflicting this modest diversion is that its the sort of film in which computers get to the bottom of every problem that comes up in about five seconds. It seems like half the running time consists of characters in cars vans or planes in their offices or hotels or just on their cell phones managing to download or send whatever secret information is in play with a click or two and nevermind such cumbersome annoyances as passwords or user IDs. And no one ever needs to call a tech supervisor. What actually is in play here is the value of the American dollar which is what Russian oligarch Viktor Cheverin (Kenneth Branagh directing himself onscreen for the first time since Hamlet) aims to collapse along with Lower Manhattan in a coordinated terrorist attack. With the Kremlin in cahoots with him as a silent partner the plan is to bring the Yankees to their knees in a way the communists were never able to do. COVER STORY Chris Pine Reveals His Politics Amid High-Risk Jack Ryan Play Equally nationalistic is Jack Ryan first seen here watching the attack on the Twin Towers while a student at the London School of Economics. Inspired to help his country hes soon in uniform serving in Afghanistan where he has the misfortune of being shot out of the sky in his chopper but the good fortune to be nursed back to health by a beguiling doctor Cathy Muller (Keira Knightley complete with an American accent) with whom he takes up as soon as his treatment is finished. There is a certain generation-spanning pleasure in watching veteran CIA handler William Harper (Kevin Costner in low-key authoritative form) set Jack up as a financial intelligence analyst within a big Wall Street firm where he spends a decade before being given five seconds to pack for his mission to Moscow. Despite living together Jack cant tell Cathy whom he works for and when she discovers a ticket stub for an afternoon showing at the Film Forum of the old thriller Sorry Wrong Number in his pants pocket shes convinced hes having an affair. Who knew that downtown venue for revivals and arty fare was a popular spy information exchange spot? EXCLUSIVE Chris Pine Jake Gyllenhaal Circling Musical Into the Woods Once Cheverin is identified as the key to the gross international monetary manipulations Jack is charged with accessing the key files the Russian has hidden from view. In a scene that doesnt make much sense Jack is put to an immediate physical test by his Moscow airport greeter a mountainous Ugandan bodyguard who tries to take him out as soon as they reach the hotel. Unexpectedly Cathy then turns up in Moscow and finally must be told what her husband does for a living leading to the films high point a dinner scene at a fancy Moscow boite during which the couple enacts an elaborate charade that allows Jack the chance to steal secret info from Cheverin whose vices -- vodka vanity women -- are neatly exploited. Such key plot elements as financial-based terrorism lingering Russian animosity towards the U.S. sleeper agents and the electronic world providing the main battleground are aptly handled and the action is plentiful if not terribly unusual. The relationship between Jack and the woman he dearly wants to be his wife is appealing and Branaghs villain is shot through with deep historic bloodlines (his office is dominated by a huge painting of Napoleon being turned away by Russians). VIDEO Chris Pine Goes for the Kill in Jack Ryan Extended Scene But theres at least one car chase too many and the climactic one in New York as the seconds tick toward another downtown disaster feels jerry-rigged specifically to include every cliche in the generic urban suspense playbook. Instead of embracing dramatic complexities and setbacks all the better to make the most of them creatively screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp are intent upon steamrolling right over them to uninvolving effect. Pine is fine as the uniformed-turned-covert patriot; he lacks the physical stature of his predecessors and its not entirely believable that he could prevail over the African bodyguard who turns on him. Beyond Costner Branagh and Knightley all good to have around the cast doesnt possess the sort of depth or number of prominent players that the earlier Jack Ryan features did. Technically the film is sharp with Moscow panoramas supplemented by scenes of Liverpool doubling as the Russian capital.

Stepping back into the spotlight just a few months after Tom Clancys death the authors famed CIA-analyst hero gets a spiffy new avatar but a fairly routine assignment in ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit."" Crisp efficient and appreciably modest in scale for a picture that imagines a Russian terrorist attack massive enough to upstage 9/11 this conspicuous attempt to breathe new life into a long-dormant action franchise gets at least a few things right chiefly the shrewd casting of Chris Pine in a role enjoyably incarnated in the 90s by Alec Baldwin (""The Hunt for Red October"") and Harrison Ford (""Patriot Games"" ""Clear and Present Danger"") before being left for dead by Ben Affleck in 2002s ""The Sum of All Fears."" But while it zips along divertingly enough and capably weaves together various topical threads involving renewed U.S.-Russia hostility and global economic instability Kenneth Branaghs latest helming effort ultimately feels assembled from too many recycled genre parts to achieve more than muffled impact in the end. Wisely pushed back to Jan. 17 from its originally scheduled Christmas Day bow the Paramount release should take advantage of a noncompetitive post-holiday frame appealing to audiences eager for unchallenging well-acted not entirely mindless popcorn fare following a slew of December awards-season hopefuls. International prospects also look solid for a franchise that has generally held its own overseas although in almost all respects ""Jack Ryan Shadow Reboot"" -- er ""Recruit"" -- has been conceived as a fresh departure from its predecessors starting with a screenplay that can be considered original to the extent that it isnt based on one of Clancys nine Ryan novels. As though acknowledging that the authors bestselling procedurals hailed from an earlier chapter of geopolitical warfare scribes David Koepp and Adam Cozad have effectively repositioned Ryans origin story in a post-9/11 context. At the same time the film reactivates some fairly hoary spy-thriller cliches in a way that nonetheless eerily reflects the heightened friction between the U.S. and Russia in light of the Edward Snowden affair the upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi and the Russian Foreign Ministrys recent expulsion of American journalist David Satter. A handsome young American studying at the London School of Economics when 9/11 hits John Patrick Ryan (Pine) is spurred into action and joins the Marines subsequently enduring a baptism by fire when his helicopter is shot down over Afghanistan in 2003. As he recovers from his injuries two key figures enter his life Cathy (Keira Knightley) a striking medical student with an irresistible tough-love approach to physical therapy; and William Harper (Kevin Costner) a world-weary CIA veteran who sets up the promising young operative for a career in financial intelligence. A decade later Ryan is living in New York with Cathy and working as a Wall Street mole covertly monitoring funds that might be linked to terrorist groups. In a few quick brushstrokes this opening stretch deftly establishes Ryan as a principled well-rounded and decidedly bipartisan hero an ideal protagonist for a new era of global technological and financial unease. Formidably brainy and respectably brawny Ryan is a slick operator who secretly stands apart from the soulless machinery of American capitalism as well as an unapologetic patriot who is nonetheless principled enough to disdain the CIAs waterboarding and rendition programs. Hes a bundle of raw talent and nerves promising but untested and Pine -- shedding not only his Starfleet uniform but also any trace of Capt. Kirks cockiness -- humanizes Ryan effortlessly whether hes figuring out how to keep the truth about his real job from Cathy or racking up his first kill. That fateful moment occurs mere moments after Ryan lands in Moscow to investigate suspicious trading activity at a bank run by the powerful oligarch Viktor Cherevin (Branagh in a delectable turn). Greeted by an assassin practically upon arrival Ryan barely has time to think before he reacts and Pine vividly registers the panic and terror of a man who however skilled and well trained he may be still cant believe the danger hes gotten himself into. The violent visceral hand-to-hand combat that follows yields the films strongest most affecting moment contrasting Ryans horror at his own ruthlessness with the CIAs coolly professional indifference as it calmly swoops in to clean up the damage. From there the yarn enters tasty if not especially twisty territory as Cherevin having skillfully averted an audit by Ryans firm enacts a battle of wits with the young agent over a fancy dinner -- one where Cathy having arrived in Moscow determined to figure out what her boyfriend is really up to plays an unexpectedly crucial role. Branagh the director has fun with the usual heist-movie conventions turning a relatively simple feat of burglary and data theft into a briskly edited setpiece that thrums along nicely if derivatively to the rhythms of Patrick Doyles score. Branagh the actor has even more fun with the role of Cherevin an intellectual and a sybarite whose roving eye (and later his sadistic streak) finds an immediate target in Cathy. Watching these two British actors flirt and parry over a glass of wine Branaghs thick Russian accent crudely caressing Knightleys flat American one is among the films more distinctive pleasures. There isnt a bad performance in the picture; Knightley brings a steely but sympathetic edge to Cathy embracing the new element of danger in her relationship with Ryan (to his chagrin) and Costner is especially fine as the rumpled jaded agency mentor whose years of field experience come through when it counts. But ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" flattens out considerably upon its return to U.S. soil running out of steam right around the point where Cherevins dastardly plot to destroy America is finally revealed and the beat-the-clock save-the-day endgame feels disappointingly pro forma. Least persuasive of all is the way in which Ryan miraculously figures out every last detail in a muddle of frenzied exposition that no smashed-up cars or flickering laptop screens can clarify. Even before that point its clear that Branagh is essentially riffing in undistinguished but not unenjoyable journeyman fashion on a series of familiar espionage-thriller templates. Theres a bit of James Bond in this world of outre villainy and cosmopolitan intrigue unfolding in a thoroughly modern Moscow (represented by U.K. locations and a few Kremlin exterior shots). But theres also a measure of Jason Bourne here -- not only in the rough-and-tumble fight choreography and camerawork but also in our sense of Ryan as a man still trying to figure out who he is and what he will become. He may well hope for a better more inspired use of his time in the future but in the meantime its good to have him back.

Bostonite says January 16 2014 at 947 pm I enjoyed the re-boot and think the actors were overall effective. It could have been a bit more Mr amp; Mrs Smith and I wonder if the writers considered having Keiras role be a russian mole (or perhaps a daughter of the Cherevin character) that Jack Ryan might yet detect in the future. That would assume she was lucky enough to be a Physical Therapist rotation Med Student prior to Jack Ryans recruitment by Costners CIA handler ( so I guess that couldnt quite work). Most of the movie Keira was a fiancee  so if they didnt get married the next movie could have a new pre-marital flame leading up to the ultimate selection(s)..... but I digress. I also agree that the James Earl Jones type personality that Kostner adopted as a handler was stereotyped. I liked the academia-to-soldier-to-recovering vet- to Intelligence progressions overall as well as the similarities to Jason Bourne and Casino Royale. Overall I appreciated the entertainment. Thank you  Reply LOL says January 16 2014 at 1208 pm I have just seen a press preview and the film is limp to say the least. All filler no killer. Keira Knightley has to be the best example of an actress with woefully limited range that still manages to fool industry people into thinking shes actually a credible thespian. Also Hollywood needs to give props to Doug Liman for instigating the action thriller trajectory that has sustained for almost fifteen years now. Reply greven says January 15 2014 at 1017 pm I just saw this movie on the strength of Branagh being quoted in an interview saying this was different from all the other car chase shoot out movies. Well Ive been on the phone to my lawyers to see if I can sue for false advertising and getting 2 hours of my life back. And dont get me started on how Ms Knightley can sustain an acting career based on one facial expression throughout anything she is in. This movie is acutely embarrassing for castcrew and audience. Reply harry georgatos says January 15 2014 at 830 pm This is a straightforward and conventional reboot of the franchise. Its basically an origin story for the main character. The best parts are in Russia as it becomes a cool spy/espionage thriller. The climax in New York seems so familiar and extremely routine that its been done a million times and better in other films. Some of the shot planning by Branagh seemed confusing and nonsensical. A good premise let down by the seen it a million times before without doing anything original Reply Robb says January 15 2014 at 135 pm A little more than ""9 Ryan Novels"" Mr. Critic. I somehow think youre not too familiar with the material or the character. Reply Carlo Irwin says January 15 2014 at 1127 am Wow these film critics are just too much to bear at times. This one is no different. If the film isnt about a dysfunctional family it just isnt good enough for the viewing public. Chang grudgingly gives the film some decent marks. Its as though he is waiting to find something anything that he can knock. Then when he does find something even if it isnt really anything he is happy to trash the film. Its really a shame that they let these kind of people critique films or anything for that matter. They are mostly sour-grapes and very full of themselves. As I have said before they have no idea what it takes to make a film and probably have never even been on a set. Reply Dave Baxter says January 15 2014 at 127 pm Commentators like you are mostly sour-grapes and very full of themselves. As I have said before they have no idea what it takes to write about film on a daily basis or construct consistent and supportable film theory and have never even worked for minor let alone major publications before. Everyones a critic. You dont like em then you dont like yourself.

Alec Baldwin introduced him in The Hunt for Red October (1990) Harrison Ford made the guy growlier in Patriot Games (1992) and Clear and Present Danger (1994) and Ben Affleck did his amorphous thing in The Sum of All Fears (2002) a film so out of step with its moment its lead was upstaged by a nuclear bomb. Those are some boring movies. So we should rejoice that Chris Pine the goony Captain Kirk of the Star Trek reboot (and far less wooden than his name would suggest) is our new Ryan. Pine is never going to successfully pull off weight-of-the-world anxiety His expression in Shadow Recruits first moments set on 9/11 might be called ""aggrieved puppy."" But it isnt hard to warm to this ex-economics student turned soldier a banter-happy flirt who in a matter of scenes turns his nurse (Keira Knightley doing her best with a thankless role and an American accent) into a longtime girlfriend. Now its present day and some rogue Russians--remember them?--have fearsome plans for a combined attack and Wall Street market takeover. The plots a bit complex for what amounts to a lot of running around--the movie cant help but evoke the Bourne series along with a high-gloss hint of Skyfall not wholly unpleasantly. Frankly the problem might be Tom Clancys empty vessel himself a character in desperate need of a gimmick a hang-up a vice. Old fox Kevin Costner plays Ryans CIA recruiter (why not him?) while director Kenneth Branagh does double duty as a caricatural baddie who loves his fitted black suits. Theres no knockout sequence no killer line. But you wont hate yourself for wasting your time.

All Rights Reserved. Russians still make the best movie villains. Since 9-11 Hollywood has been queasy about giving us fictional baddies from Arab countries -- the line between cheap stereotypes and real-life religious extremism is too blurry too delicate. South American drug lords have had their day and Albanians in bad sweaters just dont cut it. But ah the Russian villains with their tragic poetic souls and political ruthlessness. No wonder Kenneth Branagh the director of Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit also cast himself as one. Its the next best thing to ruling the world. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In his heart of hearts Branagh might like to do that too but hes had to settle for directing blockbusters and they at least suit his seemingly larger-than-life ambitions. Though nothing can match the wackadoodle inventiveness of his 2006 Magic Flute (which weirdly didnt get a proper U.S. theatrical release until 2013) or the majestic sweep of his 1996 Hamlet Branaghs 2011 Thor managed to hurl a few inspired thunderbolts -- he approached Marvels phony Norse mythology as if he were interpreting Wagner. With Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit the latest entry in the somewhat patchy canon of Tom Clancy adaptations Branagh enters more realistic territory -- provided your idea of realism is elastic enough to embrace the adventures of a dutiful young CIA agent who races the clock to stop a megalomaniacal Russian financier from blowing up Wall Street. Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit is half silliness half swagger but Branaghs arms-akimbo impudence as a director makes it work. He takes it all seriously but with a wink.Chris Pine plays Jack Ryan or rather a new kind of Jack Ryan Hes a promising young student at the London School of Economics until 9-11 changes everything. He joins the Marines and barely survives a chopper crash in Afghanistan coming close to losing the use of his legs. Luckily a young doctor-in-training at his rehab orders him to ""Walk damn it"" or words to that effect. And because that almost-doctor Cathy is played by Keira Knightley -- a woman with the eyes of a seductress and the jawline of an adorable baby shark -- he dares not disobey.Film DetailsCritics Pick Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time106 More Info Trailer Meanwhile CIA elder William Harper (Kevin Costner now in full-on silver-fox mode and looking good) notices that young Jack has pluck. Would he like to work for the organization as a plant at a Wall Street firm keeping an eye out for hinky funds transfers that could signal terrorist activity? ""Covertly?"" Ryan asks his eyes widening. He accepts and though his job mostly involves looking at a computer screen day in and day out -- barring the occasional secret meeting at of all places New Yorks Film Forum -- he eventually heads to Moscow for his first field assignment. There he crashes a thugs head into a hotel bathroom bidet and later rather shakily drowns the guy in a few inches of bathtub water. It takes some elbow grease to be a shadow recruit.Branagh orchestrates all this action with Zeus-like aplomb. That early bathroom brawl is a real bone-rattler Bodies fly taking chunks out of any porcelain or plaster they happen to hit and even though Jack survives the ordeal hes visibly shaken by his first kill. Pine initially seems a little too indistinct perhaps too irredeemably sweet to play such an America-first go-getter (portrayed in previous movies by Alec Baldwin Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck). But as his Ryan surveys his horrible handiwork his face looks so ruddy and youthful -- the weight of what hes done hits us just when it hits him. Even amid all this potboiler espionage madness Pine is steadfastly human a Jack Ryan whose patriotism isnt likely to override his conscience.In fact before Ryan even takes the CIA job he asks Harper outright about waterboarding -- the clear subtext being he wants no part of it. The world has changed since Clancy wrote his first Jack Ryan novel The Hunt for Red October in 1984 and neither Branagh nor screenwriters Adam Cozad and David Koepp have any interest in living in the past. Except maybe when it comes to resuscitating Russia as a source of colorful villains. Branaghs character Viktor Cherevin is a cirrhosis-afflicted satyr who prefers his women beautiful and married -- stealing them away is half the fun. And so when he gets a gander at Cathy -- she and Jack are a couple though as yet unmarried and shes clueless about the true nature of his job -- he practically devours her with his gnomish male gaze.Its a little strange to see an actress of Knightleys fierceness cast as the imperiled babe (Cathy has followed Jack to Russia as a ""surprise"" the sort of thing unsuspecting significant others are always doing in espionage fiction) but Knightley holds her own. When Viktor cozies up to her in a tony Moscow restaurant she purrs back at him like a kitten but you can almost see the tigers blood throbbing in her temples.Still Viktor isnt easily swatted away. His accent is thick like borscht; his eyes are cold like vodka. Hes a collection of walking cliches writ large enough to show up on the big screen. Branagh as both an actor and director is old-fashioned that way. Even though plenty of people will end up watching Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit on their iPads or on a tiny square installed in the back of an airline seat Branagh is steadfast in his love of grandeur. Its as if his goal is to be visible from the moon. And who knows? Maybe he is.2 Keira Knightley in Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit.Photo by Larry Horricks - (c) 2012 Paramount Pictures. All Rights Reserved.

Garnish with quips. Serve shaken -- not stirred -- in a large expensive film. Thats been the recipe for a 007 movie for more than 50 years and like the classic vodka martini its been often adopted adapted adulterated and just plain ruined. ""Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit"" though gets the international-espionage ingredients almost exactly right. Of course its immediate inspiration isnt Ian Fleming but Tom Clancy. And it fudges the formula a bit giving its superspy a fiancee. (It helps that shes the charming Keira Knightley; it hurts that she discards some of that charm by doing an ugly American accent.) But the story (an original one cowritten by David Koepp who also did the original ""Mission Impossible"" reboot) not only seems to look to the Bond movies for ideas but to the first pre-Hollywood Bond novels. So the Russians are the baddies again (funny how those things go in cycles). There is a bit of brutal hand-to-hand combat some barbed dinner-table conversations with the accented villain and of course a climax with a big ticking time-bomb. But more important theres also a sense -- lost over the many Bond films -- of a young military hero turned spy who yearns for the clean uniformed struggles of the battlefield who is sickened by his first killing and who depends on a mentor to guide him. Of course the film draws from the original Clancy books too. And manages to be true to the series while avoiding the cinematic baggage brought by such former onscreen Jack Ryans as Alec Baldwin Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck. The movie briskly directed by Kenneth Branagh begins with Chris Pines Ryan as a college student - and before the credits have even begun hes seen 9/11 joined the Marines been shot down in Afghanistan met the love of his life at the hospital and been recruited by the CIA. You see what I meant by ""briskly""? Soon Ryans working undercover on Wall Street looking for secret terrorist bank accounts -- when he notices some financial irregularities in Russia. So now its off to Moscow where the games of cat and mouse quickly begin and soon involve not just bonds but bombs. Branagh shows up as the bad guy too a Russian mobster-millionaire out to wreck the American economy and he has just the right amount of fun with the part and the accent. (Even more convincing -- not surprisingly -- is Mikhail Baryshnikov as an icy Kremlin official.) And while Pine isnt much more than brash and energetic as Ryan adding some grey hair and gravitas to the American side is Kevin Costner very good as the military man who brings the younger man into the CIA turns him into a weapon and then aims him at the target. Not that the movie doesnt make some missteps. For example theres a scene where Knightley who thinks her husband is having an affair is relieved to find out hes actually only been off killing Russian agents; this might work played as very black comedy but its done too straight here. And -- by Clancy standards even by Fleming standards -- the central plot idea is a little xenophobic at best with nasty Russian nationalists out to wreck the U.S. economy. (What the filmmakers think Americans cant screw up capitalism all by themselves?) But the blue-eyed Pine is cheerfully courageous (""like a Boy Scout on a field trip"" Costner mock-grumbles) the (occasionally real) Russian locations are colorful and the whole thing concludes with a well-staged race against the inevitable ticking clock. Yeah so its not quite Bond James Bond. But its Ryan Jack Ryan -- a promising start to a probable new franchise and an early bright spot in what looks like a long slushy winter. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Jack Ryan Shadow Recruit (PG-13) Paramount (105 min.) Directed by Kenneth Branagh. With Chris Pine Kevin Costner.
