They give us Peter the elfin-eared sprite very much as we remember him and the film aimed at wee tots has been animated with as vivid a feeling for movement and perspective as say The Little Mermaid. Which only goes to show that it takes more than technique to make a good childrens picture. In Never Land Jane daughter of the grown-up Wendy enjoys her own set of adventures earning her stripes as a ""Lost Girl."" Theres always something to look at but the story is weak tea.

Starring Britney Spears . Directed by Tamra Davis . (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres no point in pretending ""Crossroads"" is worse than it is. As pop- singing actresses go Britney Spears is not an embarrassment (like Madonna) and not yet an actress (like Mandy Moore ). And the movie is fascinating in its own strange way not as entertainment but as a cultural document. Go into any supermarket and theres Britney smiling from the cover of at least two magazines. Adults might forget her between TV commercials but she has been for years whispering nonstop into preteen and pubescent ears. ""Crossroads"" is a chance to eavesdrop on what shes been saying. She plays Lucy a virginal high school valedictorian who loves to sing. Her father (Dan Aykroyd) wants her to become a doctor but shes conflicted. She feels shes just not a doctor and not yet a singer either. There has always been a disconnect between Spears offstage and onstage personae. When not singing she cultivates the image of a scantily clad but chaste young lady. But onstage she acts like every sailors pal when the fleets in. At a pop concert this disparity can work. Music blurs edges elevates personality and pushes everything into the dimension of fantasy. But a movie makes everything literal. So in ""Crossroads"" we home in on a wholesome young thing then see her bumping grinding and groaning as though in a state of arousal. What is this about? Lucy and two of her old friends hook up with a young man and drive cross- country to Hollywood. Their driver (Anson Mount) has a prison record for violating the Mann Act. So now hes taking three underage girls over multiple state lines. Give the man credit. He finds a crime he likes and he sticks with it. Throughout ""Crossroads"" director Tamra Davis finds ways to show Spears off. She appears in her underwear twice in the first 15 minutes and carts out her trademark zany look -- eyes crossed tongue out. She sings ""I Love Rock and Roll"" in a karaoke bar and never stops giving us renditions of ""Im Not a Girl Not Yet a Woman"" which is the worst kind of bad song. Bad and catchy. In the end ""Crossroads"" is a lot like Spears herself. It cultivates not the illusion of wholesomeness since no ones buying it but the pretense of it. Yet examine the movies message and its pretty insidious. We see Britney taking off on a cross-country trip without her fathers permission hanging up on Dad when he tells her to come home and sharing her bed with an ex-con who looks as if hes 30. And the movie doesnt present this as naughty or even adventurous. Rather it presents this as the behavior of a nice girl whos a little on the nerdy conservative side. If this is a nice girl this is not good news though not yet a disaster. Advisory This film contains sexual situations and coarse language. -- Mick LaSalle SUPER TROOPERS Comedy. Starring Jay Chandrasekhar  Brian Cox . Directed by Chandrasekhar. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). . The members of the comedy troupe Broken Lizard are frat guys whove matured but only slightly. Their comedy ""Super Troopers"" is more sophisticated than say ""American Pie 2"" but theyve still got the good sense to know you cant have a romp without a little raunch. The dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen. Thats right ""Super Troopers"" makes those officers in the mustaches and aviator shades -- the ones who pull you over and say ""Did you know how fast you were going?"" as if you didnt -- into comic and even sympathetic characters. Broken Lizard founder Jay Chandrasekhar the movies director plays the lead patrolman with the reassuring comic presence of Ray Romano. Hes the most levelheaded of the Vermont state troopers who toy with stoned teenagers and play dumb word games to ease their boredom. What little plot exists concerns the troopers rivalry with local police encroaching on their strip of highway. The first part of the picture is so tame that you wonder about the ""R"" rating with innocent tomfoolery like a rookie trooper being doused with whipped cream. Then the sexual high jinks begin. A running gag involves a German couple in a hot Porsche who show theres more than one way to be fast. Theres also a bit about bestiality thats beautifully done -- and bestiality is hard to do well. Mostly ""Super Troopers"" is plain goofy. When a trooper joins a local policewoman on a drug case he says ""We can be like Cagney and Lacey."" When she points out that those were two women he says ""OK Ill be Lacey."" Brian Cox the great Scottish actor revels in the role of the chief who knows when to reprimand his charges and when to join them in an old-fashioned sirens-blaring drunk. ""Super Troopers"" miscalculates with jokes about Afghanistan and the Taliban. Since the movie played Sundance more than a year ago the references obviously predate Sept. 11 which also means there was plenty of time to edit them out. . This film contains raw language drug and sexual humor. -- Carla Meyer RETURN TO NEVER LAND Animation. Directed by Robin Budd . Written by Carter Crocker and Temple Mathews. (G. 72 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). . Peter Pan is still a Lost Boy. Captain Hook still wants his hide. And Wendy Darling is grown up with two kids of her own. ""Return to Never Land"" the Walt Disney Pictures sequel to ""Peter Pan"" picks up the threads of the 1953 Disney animated feature -- based on the James M. Barrie classic -- and jumps forward to World War II when Wendy and family are living through bombings blackouts and evacuations. Her son Daniel roughly 5 is adorable and frisky. Daughter Jane about 12 is a gloomy spoilsport who dismisses her mothers tales of Peter Pan and Tinker Bell as ""childish nonsense."" Only when shes kidnapped by Captain Hook and taken to Never Land does Jane learn the power of faith and enchantment. This is pleasant safe entertainment that ought to appeal to kids younger than 10 especially to girls with its female-empowerment fantasy. Its got a good heart and a buoyant spirit familiar characters and a nice message about keeping ones heart open to experience and magic. Compared with such computer-animated features as ""Toy Story"" ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters Inc."" however ""Return to Never Land"" seems dated and ordinary. The standard for animation was raised significantly by those recent films from Pixar and Pacific Data Images in technical terms but also in humor hipness and character definition. Going back to ""Never Land"" then feels a bit like taking a ride in an old bumpy Studebaker. The plot is predictable and formulaic the colors muted the music forgettable and the action pokey. Since the focus is on skeptical Jane the Peter character remains sketchy and undeveloped. Foppish Capt. Hook is played for laughs crying ""Cast off you mangy dogs"" with theatrical elan then quivering like custard when a giant octopus occupies the deck of the Jolly Roger. For children theres something irresistible in seeing a stern authority figure like Hook exposed and humiliated. What better fun than ripping off the big mans pants literally in this case and subverting his silly facade of control and superiority? Veteran voice actor Corey Burton doesnt have quite as much fun with the part as Hans Conreid did in the 1953 cartoon or Australian actor Cyril Ritchard in the 1950s musical ""Peter Pan"" with Mary Martin. He doesnt quite pull off that absurd campy pomposity. But with so little else to distract us in ""Return to Neverland"" hes a blessing. -- Edward Guthmann SCOTLAND PA. (Dark comedy. Starring James LeGros  Maura Tierney  Christopher Walken . Directed and written by Billy Morrissette . (R. 102 minutes. At the Lumiere). . In ""Scotland Pa."" former actor and novice filmmaker Billy Morrissette transplants ""Macbeth"" to a 1970s burger joint populated by losers in their 30s who booze it up and race Camaros when not plotting coups. It all sounds way too cute and sometimes it is. The film works more as a concept than as a collection of funny lines and some comic premises bomb outright like the ""three hippies"" standing in for the three witches. But ""Scotland Pa."" succeeds because of the casts communal vibe of arrogant stupidity. Pat McBeth the counter girl at Duncans restaurant is the sharpest tack among the mouth breathers. Shes played by Maura Tierney Morrissettes wife and the fine TV actress from ""ER"" and ""NewsRadio."" Tierney has always been sexy in a sensible-shoes matching-401(k) kind of way but here she really lets loose. Her Lady Macbeth is a libidinous puppet master who prods her dullard fry cook husband ""Mac"" (James LeGros) into murder so they can install a drive-through. Nobody said progress came without sacrifice. When Mac gets passed over for the managers job his wife sees red and the restaurant owner lands in the deep fryer. You probably have some idea of what happens next The McBeths turn the restaurant into a gleaming fast-food palace but their respective psychoses and a detective named McDuff impede their rise to town pillars. Christopher Walken a master at genial evil makes McDuff as inscrutable as Tierneys Pat is transparent. When the scheming Pat flirts with the lawman he appears to respond shyly. Its hard to tell whos scamming whom but the smart moneys on McDuff. LeGros slowly transforms his character from dunderhead to calculating killer and he makes a good comic foil for Walken. As Macs pal Banco Kevin Corrigan wears his ""ugly guy"" glasses from ""Walking and Talking"" and reeks of squandered potential. The picture gets an enormous boost from music by 70s working-class heroes like Bad Company and Three Dog Night. The songs evoke a very specific era -- after Vietnam and before disco -- and move along but never overwhelm the story. Having a sensitive young football player intently listen to Janis Ians ""At Seventeen"" near a poster from ""Cabaret"" says more than any dialogue ever could. Advisory This film contains violence raw language sexuality. -- Carla Meyer THE TOWN IS QUIET Drama. Starring Ariane Ascaride  Jean-Pierre Darroussin Julie-Marie Parmentier and Gerard Meylan. Directed by Robert Guediguian . (Not rated. 132 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) . ""The Town Is Quiet"" is an audacious film set in contemporary Marseille. Writer-director Robert Guediguian has created a strange mosaic of a plot most of it surrounding a middle-aged woman with an unemployed alcoholic husband and a desperate junkie daughter. There isnt the usual story. Rather there are incidents occurring over a small period of time to a handful of characters. Only later perhaps does one realize that these events have one point of similarity They are emblematic of some fundamental decay at the heart of urban life. Something isnt rotten in Marseille. Everything is rotten in Marseille. Ariane Ascaride plays Michele who works every night in a fish market only to come home to a miserable household in which she has to listen to the bitter recriminations of her wastrel husband and care for her daughters illegitimate infant. Anything bad that can happen in ""The Town Is Quiet"" happens. In one scene Michele walks in to find the daughter (Julie-Marie Parmentier) turning tricks in the living room. Michele is appalled but as her daughters dependence on heroin becomes more acute and the need for money more desperate she herself decides to try prostitution. At 300 francs a pop she starts seeing a hapless cabdriver. At times Guediguians film seems almost as if its about to slide into utter absurdity. He keeps upping the stakes and piling on shocks until it borders on the ridiculous. Yet his strategy keeps him one step ahead of his audience throughout and the shocks never quite seem gratuitous. Always one gets the sense that this film is coming from some place real and terrible. . Advisory This film contains violence nudity sexual situations and harsh language. -- Mick LaSalle Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

USATODAY.com - Never Land falls short of Peter Pan Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 02/14/2002 - Updated 0928 PM ET Never Land falls short of Peter Pan By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Return to Never Land (out of four) Stars Blayne Weaver Harriet Owen Corey Burton Director Robin Budd Donovan Cook Distributor Disney Rating G Peter Pan oh grow up -- if only to prevent more sequels from ruining the true spirit of the original. This follow-up seems so similar to the 1953 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter. Where can one go from James Barries classic fantasy of three British schoolchildren who visit an island inhabited by swaggering lost boys menacing pirates mysterious Indians and one tiny fairy? Not very far apparently. The sequel begins with an adult Wendy telling the story of the boy who wouldnt grow up to her rapt young son and talking sheepdog (a descendant of the originals Nana). But Wendys daughter Jane is at that early adolescent stage when flights of fancy are left behind for more worldly matters. She cuts off her curls wears military fatigues and scoffs at old-fashioned notions. So of course Jane is kidnapped by the haughty (but not hottie) Captain Hook and spirited away to Never Land. The message comes through as loud as the ringing of Tinks bell Youre never too old to be playful. The movie has an old-school feel despite the use of digital animation blended with traditional style. Children particularly those under 10 will likely enjoy the story; parents probably will like the 72-minute running time. That might be the real hook.
