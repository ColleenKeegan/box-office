Spearheaded by the UKs own Lesbian Vampire Killers 2009s comic slate displays a disturbing attitude towards the fairer sex sure theyre nice to look at but theyre also superfluous and potentially even life-threatening. Todd Phillipss previous big success Old School fell squarely in the frat camp marrying 80s-style debauchery with a broad streak of appealingly daft slapstick. The Hangover retains the former but ditches the latter in favour of a series of loud aggressive increasingly unlikely set-piece gags. An intriguing time-hopping set-up - a group of friends wake after a Vegas stag party and attempt to piece together the previous nights activities - is wasted on obnoxious characters celebrity cameos and crass attempts at humour.It doesnt help that the central cast is almost entirely forgettable from the smug lounge lizardry of Bradley Cooper to the boisterous Jack Black-lite of Zach Galifianakis. A genuine star - Vaughn Rudd either Wilson brother - would have made these characters likeable rather than simply pitiful and tiring. Ironically the only memorable performance in the film - aside from a lumbering if entirely appropriate cameo from Mike Tyson - is given by Heather Graham as a hapless hooker. Her geisha-like docility contrasted with a vicious hectoring performance from Rachael Harris as a castrating girlfriend sums up the films prehistoric attitude women may be cute but dudes dont need the hassle.

But when I watched it I was bored the whole way through I could predict everything that was going to happen and the humor was cheap. I was so happy when it was over. The way the men act... disrespectful disgusting and completely annoying. Plus it was extremely unrealistic. This is obviously a mans film. I wasnt amused one bit. I wanted the 2 hours of my life back. I guess thats what I get for listening to opinions of idiotic people that I dont particularly like.

Now that I have that out of the way Ill say that I cant understand why everybody is going around acting like this is the best movie ever made. It was mildly amusing at best. I felt like it should have been longer for some reason and a lot of the humor was just stupid and not the fun kind of stupid. I didnt need to see a fat hairy guys bare butt in multiple shots while he talked to his soon-to-be brother-in-law and it really wasnt funny to watch him grab a babys hand and make it look like it was masturbating or when he yelled at the tailor for getting ""too close ""to his ""shaft"". Imagining a theater of people laughing hysterically at stuff like that makes me wonder how long it will be until we have movies like ""Ass"" (as seen in the film ""Idiocracy"") winning awards and everyone raving about how great they are. Like I said it was a basically a fun movie to watch and definitely has its moments but I still cant see why people are going around telling me I ""need to see it"" because its so hilarious. Overall I would probably give it a three out of five stars. Youre probably better off watching ""Dude Wheres My Car?"".Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 4 2010nickFeaturedOk twat and Tom huddleston if your miserable enough in your own lives that you cant enjoy comedy on such a simplistic and ironic basis as displayed in this film i pity you. The whole purpose of films such as this are to get people to not worry or care. and by the way Tom the actor are not forgettable. Some of zachs early stuff is just as funny. In all fairness I think your review of this film would be so much more lighthearted and you would enjoy it a lot more if you removed the stick from your ass and tried to enjoy the cinema. Twat if you hated it that bad you dony have to lie to us we know you went in with a bias and not open mindedness. Plain to see. Go watch it again and try to enjoy yourself fellasHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 3 2010StevieFeaturedThis is one of the funniest films i and everyone i know has seen in a while.

Do not try and resist The set-up--four dudes go to Vegas for a bachelor party that goes awry--could have easily devolved into cliched territory. But thankfully there is no ""Vegas baby Vegas"" moment. Instead the films funny action takes place after the debauchery with the boys waking up to chickens and tigers and a baby-in-a-closet and missing teeth and no recollection of what the hell just happened. ""Because we obviously had a great time"" is how Bradley Coopers shady-cat character reasons away the memory loss. Really? The groom (Justin Bartha) is missing So the gang (which includes Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis) must try to retrace their steps and of course hilarity ensues. Todd Phillips who gave the world Old School back in 2003 (thank you) is in the saddle with this one directing from a well-paced script by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (much much better than their last effort Ghosts of Girlfriends Past). You might be embarrassed by laughing at some of the silliness but dont be Everyone else will be cracking up too.

"The Trip Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review The TripSteve Coogan and comic partner Rob Brydon riff on life and rib each other while traveling the English countryside.June 10 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Rob Brydon left gets a taste of what Steve Coogan ordered in ""The... (Phil Fisk / IFC Films )Road trips by their very nature tend to be part plan part improvisation part fun part irritation. And so it is with ""The Trip"" starring British comic actor Steve Coogan and his frequent pranking partner Rob Brydon. Theyre doing another riff on the ""characters"" Steve and Rob who were responsible for most of the tongue-in-cheekiness of ""Tristram Shandy A Cock amp; Bull Story."" This latest bit of silliness reunites them with filmmaker Michael Winterbottom who seems to have endless patience with their antics having worked with them on 2005s ""Tristram"" and 2002s ""24 Hour Party People."" ""The Trip"" began as a six-episode faux documentary series on British TV in the fall of last year. Now its been nipped and tucked to about half of its original size and released here as a film which might sound improbable but surprisingly it works (no doubt helped by the labors of editors Mags Arnold and Paul Monaghan). As this is near total improvisation there is no writing credit and that holds up remarkably well too. According to a premise that gets played around with as much as everything else Steve has been dispatched to Englands rural byways as a food critic. Hes to weigh in on the gourmet offerings at a series of posh boutique hotels for the Observer (prepare to be craving exquisitely plated scallops by the end). He had intended to make the trip with his foodie girlfriend Mischa (Margo Stilley) but theyre going through a rough patch. After running through a list of possible replacements he ends up with Rob as a traveling companion. So Steves disgruntled before they even get on the road and Robs kissy goodbyes to wife and baby do not improve the mood. Its a clash of sweet and sour from the start. As it was in ""Tristram Shandy"" the worm turns on the competing egos of actors and the extraordinary manifestations that can take. Steve wants to ensure hes got the better room at each of their six stops a sometimes size matters in other cases its the view and still others its which is the favorite of the pretty concierge who might later occupy his bed. He also wants the better dish at the restaurants with Rob forever winning that one hands down a always ordering the scallops which manage to look impossibly delicious and differently dressed with inventive flourishes of sauces and sprigs of this or that. Not surprisingly the car is one of the main battlegrounds starting with which routes to take. There will be a lot of amusing irritants like the competing Michael Caine impersonations a as in who can do his voice better? Whats the difference between early Caine and current Caine? And when they tire of that though they rarely do theres Woody Allen Liam Neeson Sean Connery and endless others to mimic. There are of course more mundane issues to contend with. Steves constant search for cellphone service has him standing in fields at the edge of cliffs climbing hilltops. ""Can you hear me now?"" punctuates his ex-wifes frustrations his U.S. agents deal-making his rocky relationship with Mischa a dropped connections in both the literal and metaphoric sense plague him. Perhaps its the years of collaboration between director Winterbottom and the two actors that makes it all feel so effortless and of the moment. That is certainly how director of photography Ben Smithard captures it his lens in their faces when confined to the car or an over-crowded hotel room then taking things from a great distance after theyre outside a with Steve as often as not in silhouette in his cell-signal search. Between philosophical musings about the food they are sampling and the nature of life in general the actors make hay poking fun at each others egocentric soft spots. Coogan and Brydon are either quite brilliant at this or just serving up slight variations of their very witty selves. Either way their travels and squabbles are great fun to watch the countryside is bucolic the food mouthwatering. You just wouldnt want to go on a real road trip with them. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESFamiliarity breeds content for Steve Coogan Rob BrydonJune 10 2011Bits of history lost and foundJuly 11 2006Caught in the act of being themselvesFebruary 10 2006A season with characterSeptember 11 2005MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-the-trip-20110610,0,5039453.story",200,thehangover2,thehangover,latimes

Star Tribune Ed Helms as Stu Zach Galfianakis as Alan and Bradley Cooper as Phil in the comedy ""The Hangover."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Hangover"" like the condition for which its named has some spirited moments but more often it stumbles and slurs regurgitating earlier pleasures and praying for the fog to lift. Drinkers and abstainers alike wouldve expected a giddier potion from director Todd Phillips whose ""Road Trip"" and ""Old School"" are the ""Mean Streets"" and ""GoodFellas"" of men-will-be-boys comedies. ""The Hangover"" takes its familiar bacchanalia to Vegas reflecting a certain desperation that might be well-suited to economic downtimes (or Scorseses ""Casino"") but not to escapist farce. Phillips working without stars (another sign of the economy) starts in the desert with a trio of beat-up and hungover working stiffs wondering where their bachelor partys guest of honor has gone. Doug due to get hitched in a matter of hours evidently disappeared at some point during a long night that a subsequent flashback reveals to have involved not just countless bottles of booze but a crying baby a snarling tiger and Mike Tyson. En route to solving the mystery our woozy heroes collect one or two distinguishing traits apiece. Stu (Ed Helms) is a clumsy dentist with a missing front tooth. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) brother of the nervous bride is shaggy-haired and none too bright. Phil a high-school teacher is the ostensible straight man. But as played by Bradley Cooper a moodier Matthew McConaughey Phil is merely the least obnoxious. One of these men jokes that Osama bin Laden took the political incorrectness out of humor on 9/11 but you wouldnt know it from the movie. Even without the details of the party itself which Phillips rather ingeniously reserves for the end credits ""The Hangover"" earns its R rating and then some. Taser-toting kids and a gold-digging stripper (Heather Graham) are among the films vulgarly undervalued supporting characters along with comically villainous Chinese. Downward mobility is what Phillips movie is all about. If the far funnier ""Road Trip"" and ""Old School"" were goofy daydreams of liberation ""The Hangover"" is a fantasy of victimization its manchildren getting bashed drugged and otherwise humiliated not often hilariously. THE HANGOVER  out of 4 stars Rating R for pervasive language sexual content including nudity and some drug material. Phillips a former documentarian has been Hollywoods foremost authority on the more debauched of American male tribal rituals -- and a bit player in his own movies. Having cast himself as ""Foot Lover on Bus"" in ""Road Trip"" and as ""Gang Bang Guy"" in ""Old School"" Phillips here plays ""Mr. Creepy"" -- an acknowledgment perhaps of lingering aftereffects from ""The Hangover.""

(Masi/AP) Joe Neumaier Thursday June 4 2009 403 PM Title The Hangover Three friends try to figure out what happened to them during a wild night in Las Vegas. With Bradley Cooper Ed Helms Zach Galifianakis. Director Todd Phillips. (136) R Violence nudity language. At area theaters. Despite the assembly-line quality of Judd Apatows comedies the guys in them are all recognizable which explains why theyve struck a chord. Todd Phillips ""The Hangover"" on the other hand has a decent setup - three friends have to reconstruct a wild bachelor party night and find the missing groom-to-be - but ruins it by cranking up the contrivances. Amusing as it is it never feels real. That may not seem like a big deal - a lot of funny movies play by their own rules - except that ""The Hangover"" keeps doubling-down on the outlandishness. Does one character have to be borderline unstable? Does a hooker have to be cartoonishly sweet? Does an Asian tough guy need to talk in goofy insults? Must the cops seem like ""Reno 911"" rejects? ""The Hangover"" would work better without all the extra beats. As Phil (Bradley Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) awaken from a post-bash stupor they find a tiger and a chicken in their suite a baby in the closet and no Doug (Justin Bartha) the guy getting married in 24 hours. With no memory of what happened they backtrack and piece by piece discover they had a helluva Friday night. Phil the leader urges focus; straight-arrow Stu worries that his shrewish girlfriend will discover he lied about going wine-tasting in Napa Valley; loose-cannon Alan cant be brought anywhere especially Vegas. Phillips has a handle on men who miss their inner boys; his 2003 ""Old School"" dealt with the same late-thirtyish dillema though that movies college-set shenanigans were sillier. Here a lot rides on Alans clinical goofiness. No explanation is given for his strange behavior so Galifianakis goes overboard making Alans weird awkwardness bigger than life. Helms and Cooper are more anchored though the endless revelations they keep responding to get tiresome. But any movie that gives Heather Graham and Mike Tyson the same minimal amount of screen time is clearly a little fuzzy-headed.

How can you make a comedy about Vegas thats funnier than them? Generally ""What Happens in Vegas"" movies is . . . not much. But ""The Hangover"" rumbles down the Strip like an elephant in heat. ""Memento"" meets ""Old School""? Its party time. PHOTOS What Happens in Vegas on the Big Screen MOVIE BLOG Hangover Comedy of the Summer? Raunchy frat comedies are as hard to pull off as any other kind because they have to keep surprising the audience and ""The Hangover"" does with a bizarre series of uproarious situations with explanations that just about stay within the bounds of plausibility. ""Old School"" headmaster Todd Phillips this time directs Bradley Cooper (a tool in ""Wedding Crashers"") Ed Helms (""The Office"") and Zach Galifianakis as three groomsmen who lose their groom during a Vegas bachelor party. Near the beginning they wake up with no memory of what happened the night before. Theyve lost a tooth and a classic Mercedes but gained a tiger a police car a hooker bride a naked Asian guy with a crowbar and an appointment with Mike Tyson. Also during the night one of them apparently gave birth. The locker room humor is dead-on full of affectionate hostility and caustic R-rated put-downs. Galifianakis insists his shoulder bag isnt a purse because Indiana Jones carries one. Retort ""So does Joy Behar."" A doctor who is asked the location of a wedding chapel says he knows exactly where it is ""At the corner of Get a Map and F - - - Off. "" Helms routine is a throwback the hangdog male out of ""The Honeymooners"" but he keeps it relatively fresh with the occasional bizarre moment. (I enjoyed the tiger lullaby he plays on the piano to help the big kitty sleep.) For the schlumpy weird and often hilarious Galifianakis this is the role he was born to play. (Almost. Actually that role would be the lead in ""The John Goodman Story."") As fuzzy and chunky as Joaquin Phoenix on the Letterman show he inquires at Caesars Palace whether Caesar actually lived there. No. He was too busy perfecting his salad. As the three of them try to figure out why theres a baby in their hotel room he brags ""Ive found a baby before."" Where? ""Coffee Bean."" Cooper hasnt really developed a comedy persona but hes a natural leader who makes the most of his many one-liners. Driving a stolen police car he gets on the bullhorn to call out ""Woman in the leopard dress -- you have an amazing rack."" The leads -- limited as they are to the roles of cool guy dorky guy dumb guy -- each get plenty of funny lines and though the script is episodic there wont be many complaints about that when there are so many imaginative sketch ideas (naked Asian guy hopping out of a trunk how to drug an angry tiger). Will the ultimate compliment be paid to ""The Hangover""? Will it be watched as a bachelor-party pregame show with shots of Jagermeister all around? No doubt. If the women in their lives are lucky guys will pass out watching the movie before they get into trouble. THE HANGOVER Night to remember. Running time 98 minutes. Rated R (profanity sex nudity drug use).

"The Trip review Dining partners spar in amusing film |       NJ.com comments The Trip review Dining partners spar in amusing film Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 10 2011 at 814 AM View/Post Comments Phil Fisk Rob Brydon left and Steve Coogan in ""The Trip"" directed by the consistently unpredictable Michael Winterbottom. Michael Winterbottom is a director who has made a career out of alternately delighting and annoying his loyal audience. He made the great music drama ""24 Hour Party People"" and then the sci-fi mess ""Code 46."" He followed ""9 Songs"" -- a grimly pornographic provocation -- with the delightfully offbeat ""Tristram Shandy"" takeoff ""A Cock and Bull Story."" Not surprisingly -- and quite advantageously for both -- Winterbottom has found a great collaborator in the similarly talented but far-from-cuddly British actor Steve Coogan whos been wonderful in previous Winterbottom films and on British TV but never caught on here. Thats not surprising perhaps. American comedy prefers its stars to be loud stupid and lovable in an infantile sort of way. Coogan most often plays a smart snobbish loser -- a sneakily hostile archetype thats as British as chips and vinegar or at least ""Fawlty Towers."" Together Coogan and Winterbottom bring out the best in each other. Movie Review The Trip (Unrated) IFC (107 min.) Directed by Michael Winterbottom. With Steve Coogan Rob Brydon. Now playing in New York. Rating note The film contains sexual situations strong language and drug use. Stephen Whittys Review THREE STARS ""A Cock and Bull Story"" -- which embodied the digressive style of Laurence Sterne by being everything but a straight adaptation of Laurence Sterne -- had Coogan and comic colleague Rob Brydon playing versions of themselves locked in a competitive backstage battle. ""The Trip"" takes off from that as Coogan -- again playing a fictionalized form of himself -- gets a newspaper assignment to take a romantic tour of Englands Lake District and its gourmet restaurants. His current foodie girlfriend though has just announced they need a ""hiatus."" So he takes Brydon instead. What follows is slow to start and sometimes fitful (its mostly improvised). But its also very funny as the sunny Brydon spends the week going through a gallery of impressions both expected (Michael Caine Al Pacino) and not (Hugh Grant Anthony Hopkins) and a dour Coogan sits beside him and seethes. Until predictably the annoyance breaks through -- in contests (their ""dueling Caines"" which you can catch on YouTube is already classic) in petty backstabbing and in nastily ""honest"" advice. The kettle-on-the-fire of quietly simmering exasperation is a hallmark of English comedy and Coogan is one of its masters. Its fun to watch him slowly steam as the chipper Brydon rambles on and on -- or to see how the two actors work together refining gags over several scenes. The infrastructure isnt always there for them to build on; this is a film as fractured as their road trip (its been edited down from a six-episode TV show) and a number of the references are bound to sail over even an Anglophiles head. But most of the jokes are great and the food (all served at real restaurants) looks terrific. And Coogans character -- who covers up his loneliness one night and lady at a time -- is spiced with just the right bittersweet touch of melancholia. The whole thing doesnt add up to a full meal perhaps. But it is as one of these chefs might say a quite delightful amuse-bouche.

When it comes to ""The Hangover"" its not the filth its the unrelenting stupidity that makes this comedy oppressive. The bachelor-party-gone-bad tale set in Vegas is directed with visual flair by Todd Phillips of ""Old School"" fame. An early shot of a guy awakening face pressed to floor chicken clucking nearby and an incisor missing is promising. Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis work well off each other as the three groomsmen who awake to a trashed villa at Caesars Palace with no memory of the night before and no groom. Phil (Cooper) is the alpha guy. Stu (Helms) is a dentist with a shrill owner -- er girlfriend -- at home. Future brother-in-law Alan (Galifianakis) repulses confounds and -- a feat -- sort of endears. ""The Hangover"" takes the anecdotes of bachelor outings gone south and dials them way up until the bass (pun intended) rattles the foundations. Mysteries abound. They lost groom Doug (Justin Bartha) but found a tiger and a baby. The one least likely to get hitched did to a nice Vegas gal. (""Heather Grahams career please come to a white courtesy phone."") Mike Tyson makes a stiff cameo playing himself. If you havent seen the trailer then theres a joke still here for you. ""The Hangover"" shares a ""no joke goes untested"" attitude with ""Borat"" (Im not a fan) and to a degree Sarah Silverman (I am a fan) who like hurtling toward ""shouldnt be shown"" and ""please dont say"" territory. Phillips boasts that his comedy is not ironic. But its still comedy for a knowing self-proclaimed post-PC generation. Some of it works. More often it tries too hard. Ken Jeongs turn as a diminutive tough guy grows tired fast. Nuance is (and arguably should be) the first thing to go once the story is set in Vegas. Yet theres a loud insistence here that starts to sound like writers sputtering. Early in this unraveling adventure a Vegas tourist quips ""Some guys just cant handle Vegas."" Yeah we know a couple writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore.

Photo Phil Fisk An IFC Films Release The Trip review Hop on for a very funny ride 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Trip Comedy. Starring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. Directed by Michael Winterbottom. (Not rated. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon are English comedians with distinctly different styles. In ""The Trip"" they play themselves brought together under a fictional premise Steve is doing an article on the cuisine of Northern England and brings Rob along on the trip. So its two guys traveling eating and talking. Doesnt sound like much. But its terrific. ""The Trip"" started out as a six-episode British television series which aired last fall. For American audiences director Michael Winterbottom has condensed the programs into a single feature that flows seamlessly with no trace of the original form. Coogan better known in the United States is low key somber and slightly irritable in his demeanor. So it was inspired to pair him with Brydon (who is quite big in Britain) a relentless comic absolutely guaranteed to get on his nerves. Part of the fun and interest of ""The Trip"" are those moments that walk the line between truth and fiction - or between fiction and real-life friction. Watching ""The Trip"" I had some of the biggest laughs Ive had in a movie all year. The comedians are competitive each trying to top the other. In one scene thats just side-splitting they go back and forth about who has the better Michael Caine imitation. Its dueling Michael Caines and its hysterical. In another scene theyre arguing over who does a better Sean Connery ordering a martini ""shaken not stirred."" Then without any preamble they shift into doing the same line as Roger Moore. Related Stories The Trip Funny and strange not long Along the way you get a culinary trip of England (I know scary) and some pertinent insights into friendship career stress and the joys and angst of middle age. Three times I caught myself checking the time while watching ""The Trip"" Each time I was hoping there would be more to go not less. -- Advisory Risque humor.

The Trip reviewed Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon as rivals friends and dueling impressionists. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 10 2011 322 PM The Trip A British comedy that has the finest Michael Caine-impression showdown in cinematic history. By Dana Stevens Read an ""Interrogation"" with Steve Coogan. Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan in The Trip Michael Winterbottoms The Trip (IFC Films) a peripatetic comedy about two comedians on a jaunt around the north of England alternately amuses bores and annoys just like its two hilariously intolerable protagonists. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon both fortysomething British comics with a long list of TV series and films to their credit play semi-fictionalized versions of themselves. Coogan known for his hugely successful BBC sitcom Im Alan Partridge is a career-obsessed serial womanizer who frets that hell never be taken seriously as an actor. Brydon a married man with a new baby is less visibly consumed by insecurity but his compulsion to do vocal impressions at every moment of the day borders on the pathological (a symptom Coogan is ever keen to point out). On a vaguely defined assignment for a newspaper Coogan has been sent to the picturesque Lake District to review six high-end restaurants. When his girlfriend backs out at the last minute Coogan invites Brydon instead making it clear that he tried and failed to get several other friends to come along first. And so the two men who inhabit a limbo somewhere between friends colleagues and rivals set out in Coogans Range Rover to explore the land of Romantic poets and the Bronte sisters. By day Coogan an aspiring outdoorsman--as he enjoys mentioning to attractive hotel employees hes brought along some crampons--drags Brydon on ill-planned hikes or visits to literary sites like Bolton Abbey where Brydon declaims Wordsworths poem of the same name in the stentorian tones of Ian McKellen. By night they alight at various swank country inns where they dine on elaborate but singularly unappetizing-looking dishes such as a greenish vegetable cocktail whose taste Brydon praises even as he compares its consistency to snot. Advertisement During the dull stretches of The Trip which are not infrequent I passed the time musing about what Winterbottom was doing making a movie like this. This shape-shifting director seems to make a film nearly every year from playful literary adaptations like the delightful Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story (which also starred Coogan and Brydon) to dramas inspired by contemporary global events (In This World A Mighty Heart) to period noir thrillers (The Killer Inside Me). For my taste Winterbottom is a bit too prolific. His 9 Songs a freewheeling sexually explicit account of a couples affair over the course of a year felt like a fitfully inspired sketch rather than a finished movie and the same could be said of The Trip which floats ideas for character arcs (Coogans compulsion to seduce women Brydons inability to speak in his own voice) that never get developed. But during the films funny stretches as when Brydon and Coogan get into a loud public row about who does the better Michael Caine I was laughing too hard to care about unexplored character arcs. (Brydons demonstration of the way Caines voice has retreated into the back of his throat as he ages is a particularly stunning feat of vocal mimicry.) These are two naturally hilarious men and when they get rolling--especially when theyre literally rolling trapped in the confines of Coogans car--they can spin comic gold out of nothing at all a few lines of Coleridge read from a guidebook an imagined scene from a Braveheart-style costume drama ""Gentlemen to bed for we ride at dawn ... Or nine-thirty-ish."" The Trip was originally conceived as a series for British television a context in which its rambling episodic structure--another day another country inn--makes more sense. If the notion of being trapped in a car for two hours with two brilliant self-centered comedians sounds like a bit much The Trip is also available on IFC on demand. There you can enjoy Brydon and Coogans improvisations the way they sip that dubiously textured vegetable cocktail just a little at a time. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

Which actors do you cast? The leading role of Phil the smart energetic audience surrogate might have suited Jim Carrey or Vince Vaughn so go with Bradley Cooper who was Carreys pal in Yes Man and Vaughns preppie torturer in Wedding Crashers. Steve Carell would have been perfect for Stu the amiable henpecked dentist; but Ed Helms Carells cohort on The Daily Show and The Office costs so much less. Now for Alan the roly-poly cute guy with a surfeit of energy and a sociopathic streak cant afford Jack Black give stand-up comic Zach Galifianakis a chance. OK we got ourselves a movie The Hangover is a pretty swell movie according to early returns from critics who on the Rotten Tomatoes website give the picture a generous 85% approval rating. (The Will Ferrell Land of the Lost the weekends other big release has so far earned an almost historically abysmal 6% -- thats right six. As in You got every answer wrong on this test young man and you didnt even spell your name right.) The reviewers see The Hangover as a return to top form by director Todd Phillips whose raucous buddy comedy Old School was Ferrells first real hit. On the new film ""Ninety minutes of pure perverse laughter."" --Julian Roman MovieWeb. ""Just might be the funniest movie of the decade."" --Greg Maki Easton (Md.) Star-Democrat. (See the Top 10 Movie Bromances.) Er... no. Unless your definition of pure perversity includes the portrayal of a convicted pedophile (""Im not supposed to be within 200 feet of a school"" says Alan ""or a Chuck-E Cheese"") whos given weekend custody of a baby; or if your idea of the decades funniest movie would contain a scene where our heroes get repeatedly tasered before a class of cheering children. Youll also need an indulgence for racial (Asian) and sexual (gay) stereotyping and the sight of inappropriate gentlemen with their pants off. All right granted that last bit is always funny. The rest is about as easy to endure as a real hangover. The script by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore sends four guys -- Doug the groom (Justin Bartha) plus Alan his fiancees oddball brother (Galifianakis) and Phil and Stu -- to Las Vegas for a booze-babes-and-baccarat bachelor party two nights before the wedding. Itll be one promises a ""night well never forget."" Next morning three of them come groggily to in their suite. With them are a tiger in the bathroom and an infant in the closet. Missing to their horror are the groom one of Stus front teeth -- and any memory of what happened the night before. Back in 2006 the film Unknown threw five men into a dungeon and robbed them all of any recollection of how they got there. The Hangover takes this scientifically suspicious multiple-amnesia gimmick references about a dozen Vegas movies (from Leaving Las... to What Happens in... to Rain Man) and applies all the numbingly familiar tropes of the bromance comedy that have made this flourishing subgenre as rigid in its conventions as Kabuki theater. Whether the guys in bromances are dating each other (I Love You Man) going to bed with each other (Superbad) or marrying each other (I Now Pronounce You Chuck amp; Larry) the common thread is the assumption by men of the traditional movie male and female roles. The women in The Hangover with the fleeting exception of Heather Graham who plays a hooker with a baby are creatures either to ignore or flee from. Phils wife makes no impression Dougs bride-to-be is a briefly seen figure of increasing anxiety and Stus longtime girlfriend is a shrew from Shrewsville. Shes so stridently castrating that Stus climactic display of spine -- kind of like the chestbuster scene from Alien only dorsal -- is a given from the get-go. Its that way with almost all the humor here virtually every joke either is visible long before it arrives or extends way past its expiration date. Theres no question that Phillipss Old School had a high quotient of shambling fun and he can frame catastrophe with a certain comedic elegance but hes hamstrung by another reductive script from Lucas and Moore whose Four Christmases and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past boasted clever structures and no acuity at all in the character and gag departments. Even Galifianakiss pervy charm and a deeply weird cameo by Mike Tyson cant save The Hangover. Whatever the other critics say this is a bromance so primitive its practically Bro-Magnon.

"The Hangover Frenetic journey worth the ride | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentThe Hangover Frenetic journey worth the rideIts a dusty well-travelled road leading through the desert to Las Vegas.Stu (Ed Helms) wakes up after a serious bender to find a chicken in his hotel room in The Hangover. Like thats never happened to you.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterFri. June 5 2009Starring Bradley Cooper Ed Helms Zach Galifianakis. Directed by Todd Phillips. 100 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Its a dusty well-travelled road leading through the desert to Las Vegas.Couple that with a creaky storyline - a bachelor party that goes horribly awry - and jaded movie critics everywhere are likely to go into The Hangover with a throbbing skepticism bordering on skull-thumping cynicism.But surprisingly this is one morning-after tale that wont require a double dose of Alka-Seltzer.We open with a visibly battered and slung-under Phil (Bradley Cooper) telling an anxious bride-to-be that getting the groom to the church on time might be a problem.Article Continued BelowFlashback 48 hours earlier and we meet the foursome ready to embark in a vintage Mercedes as Doug (Justin Bartha) assures his dad-in-law-to-be their night in Vegas isnt going to stray beyond anything worse than one heck of a bender.""What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas"" the wise patriarch counsels ""except for herpes - that s--- will come back with you.""While Doug is likeably clean-cut hes about to take an extended departure from the screen leaving us with a trio of groomsmen who arent quite as easy to warm up to.Theres Phil a disdainful schoolteacher with a reckless nature and a Cheshire Cat grin and Stu (The Offices Ed Helms) a tightly wound dentist saddled with a castrating shrew of a girlfriend. Future brother-in-law Alan is clearly only along for the ride at siss request. As played by Zack Galifianakis hes an annoyingly pudgy man-child whose mere presence turns male bonding into an excruciatingly awkward experience.After the trio wake up in their spectacularly trashed hotel suite they must sift through a series of clues to reconstruct the night before to find the missing groom.From here on much credit goes to the script by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore in making this frenetic journey worth the ride. The clues strewn in the hapless trios path include a clucking chicken a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in the closet while whats missing - beyond the groom - include the vintage car a mattress and a tooth. Along the way our desperate heroes get Tasered shot at and roughed up by a crazy cast of characters including former boxer Mike Tyson and a foul-mouthed Chinese gambler.It helps enormously in the suspension of disbelief that the story is set in Vegas a place where oddball types are as common as cacti and the unlikeliest things are far more likely to happen.Director Todd Phillips who tackled the theme of men seeking to shrug off the burden of adulthood in Old School explores similar territory here with solid comic results. More difficult still hes able to transform our negative vibes about the three guys to a point where we begin to root for them as their travails progress and multiply.The final frames a slide show of sorts of the naughty night in question helps to tie up any loose ends - except possibly the chicken - to provide a hilariously cathartic denouement.The Hangover isnt going to answer any vital age-old questions such as why is it that men so easily shed the mantle of civilized behaviour and behave like idiots?But a strong cast a quirky script with some unexpected twists and a steady hand from the directors chair make this a desert ride on the wild side a worthy road trip.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Someone has finally felt their pain and made ""The Hangover"" a comedy that belches mightily -- and amusingly -- in the direction of all those romcoms that seem underwritten by bridal magazines. Gone is that hushed tearful reverence for nuptial convention the ring the vows and moms streaming cheeks as dad leads their daughter down the aisle. Whats left is a movie dedicated to pure guy panic -- the compulsion to escape all adult responsibility and enjoy every second on the freedom clock before the inevitable ""I do."" In other words ""Hangover"" is the male un-romcom. To appreciate it is to enjoy the vicarious release of being an utter moral buffoon and getting away with it. Our stars are four dumpy dull or deeply flawed men whose idea of mischief is banal and sleazy. They possess not a scintilla of moral backbone or romantic heroism. Theres Doug (Justin Bartha) the handsome but dull groom to be who agrees to enjoy one last hurrah in Vegas with his friends before tying the knot. After all whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. That fine city you see is the external symbol for male moral compartmentalization. If it happened over there it didnt ""really happen."" Dougs pals include Phil (Bradley Cooper) a married father and teacher who accepts cash payments for A grades from his students; Stu (Ed Helms) a Stepford husband who echoes exactly what his nasty wife (Rachael Harris) tells him to; and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) Dougs brother-in-law-to-be whose inappropriate impulses and utterances would need a plethora of mental health professionals to mitigate. But almost as soon as they embark into that good night all becomes oblivion. They dont remember a thing. Who was the stripper leaving their hotel room early in the morning? How did that live tiger end up in their bathroom? And what the heck happened to Doug? Hes nowhere to be found. As they investigate what happened their excesses of the night before portend a darker scenario than even they thought possible. There seems to have been a dalliance -- even a quickie marriage -- with a pole dancer (Heather Graham). Police officers are on the scene. Lots of money seems to be owed to the wrong people. And part of their evening may have been spent partying in Mike Tysons home. They have only another 24 hours to put the pieces together locate Doug and get back to the wedding alive. Male immaturity -- in case you havent seen the last 25 Judd Apatow movies -- would seem to be the screens most depleted fossil fuel. Yet it remains comedys most renewable resource. Is it because we learn something new about mans inherent goofiness each time or because the theaters are packed with the very characters were watching? We contend its the writing. (Made you sit up.) Apatows uncanny ability to plumb the shallow depths of manhood and find something touching and interesting amounts to the equivalent of postmodern alchemy. Even though Apatow has no fingerprints over this movie ""The Hangover"" follows in the same surprise-me tradition It takes us to the dumb side but comes back with something unexpectedly affecting. In this case its the edgy tone. Director Todd Phillips (the guy who gave you Will Ferrell running naked through ""Old School"") and screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore shift the crass comedy subgenre into the edgy environs of post-film noir. Sitting through ""The Hangover"" is like watching ""Memento"" featuring the Three Stooges. What makes this ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" variation so disturbingly compelling is its extreme proximity to the horrible and the tragic. As these hapless fools try to piece together a lost night forensic clue by clue the list of crimes and imbroglios theyve committed -- without a trace of memory -- gets steadily worse. And we fear a brutal Scorsese movie is about to tear through the walls of this comic plot at any minute. Were waiting for a wiseguy with an acetylene torch and a twisted smile. And we find ourselves choking -- and laughing -- amid the consequences of a guy-centric world gone horribly wrong. Its a parallel universe in which there are essentially two kinds of women the humorless partners to whom the men are betrothed and strippers with hearts of gold. And their only way out of this nightmare is return from the proverbial fire back to the frying pan -- back to the noble institution of marriage. Back to civilization and ceremony. Talk about a punch line. The Hangover (99 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for pervasive profanity sexual content including nudity and some drug material. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Bradley Cooper Hes Still Just One of the Guys Serving Up Sin amp; Tonic Find Hangover Showtimes Tickets Summer Movie Guide Bradley Cooper Tests His Movie Memory Bradley Cooper Discusses The Hangover The Hangover Discuss Coopers Next Move",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/04/AR2009060404344.html,200,thehangover15,thehangover,washingtonpost

Rocky Balboa vs. Apollo Creed. Steve Coogan vs. Rob Brydon? Video The Trip More about The Trip >> In The Trip Michael Winterbottoms riotous and resplendent road movie two of Britains comedy titans face off in an epic match of dueling impressions. Does Coogan the acerbic hangdog star of 24 Hour Party People and the out-of-Sundance-and-into-oblivion Hamlet II do a better Michael Caine? Does Brydon stocky spry and much loved in his homeland for his hit BBC series and eponymous TV fare do the more nuanced Sean Connery as James Bond? Its a relentless and relentlessly funny game of one-upmanship as the two men playing somewhat exaggerated versions of themselves roam the hills and dales posh inns and poetic ruins of Englands Lake District. The Trip was originally shot for British television and reedited as a rambling but illuminating odyssey that has as much to do with friendship - and the competition and conflicts that come with it - as it does with celebrating the comedic chops of its two stars. The jokes the riffing the almost scary channeling of Richard Burton and Anthony Hopkins Al Pacino and Woody Allen will throw you into paroxysms - Ill give a dollar to anyone who can watch this film without cracking up - but Winterbottom isnt merely playing it for laughs. By the end when Coogan and Bryson have returned to their respective London abodes (Brydon to a comfy townhouse and loving wife Coogan to a modern high-rise and to no one) The Trip is awash in a kind of cathartic melancholy. The premise Coogan has been invited by a magazine to review a weeks worth of fancy restaurants in the Lake District and the Yorkshire Moors. At the last minute his girlfriend opts out heading for the States instead. So Coogan calls to see if Brydon might want to tag along. He might. Coogan and Brydon worked together in Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story Winterbottoms meta-adaptation of the 18th-century novel. The two played three members of the Shandy family between them but also played themselves - actors making the film. An amicable combativeness was evident and Winterbottom clearly thought he could milk it for more. He has. As the gents settle down for their hand-dived scallops and lakeland venison their cockle butters and chestnut foams swilling from their wine glasses with knowing nods (as foodies theyre pretty much clueless) the banter and the bad puns the quotations from 007 and Hannibal Lecter ensue. And in between the dinners and the discourse and the drives Coogan mopes about his career his life. Hes on the phone to his agent in America talking about a TV series in L.A. Or hes trying to reach his girlfriend - the lousy connection makes for a pretty good metaphor. Ive seen The Trip twice now first at the Toronto Film Festival last fall where the audience was ecstatically loopy by the end and then again a few weeks ago. And even when you know that the battle of the Caines is coming or that scene in the churchyard among centuries-old gravestones with each delivering the imagined eulogy for the other theres none of that empty echo-effect - the experience of realizing that on the second go the movie you thought was so hilarious really isnt. If anything The Trip the second time around is even funnier. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Better believe it. The Hangover disarmed me by starting at the end the morning after the bachelor party. Phil (Bradley Cooper) a married teacher is on the phone telling the bride that he his friend Stu (Ed Helms) a pussy-whipped dentist and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) the brides pervy brother have lost Doug (Justin Bartha) the groom-to-be. Could this movie about a bachelor party actually leave out the party? It could. And were all the better for it. To watch these hungover guys -- theyve actually been drugged -- struggle awake in a trashed Vegas suite featuring a burning couch a crying baby a sizzling stripper (Heather Graham good to see you) a live chicken and a Bengal tiger owned by Mike Tyson is well a sight gag for the time capsule. I couldnt help laughing. Fellow critics (though the hypocrites might deny it) laughed too. Funny? The Hangover rocks the house with funny. What else to know? That Galifianakis -- spell it say it learn it -- is the new rock star of comedy; that Helms of The Office can crack you up when you least expect it; that Cooper from Wedding Crashers can spoof his leading-man looks like a born goofball; that Tyson doing an air-drum solo to ""In the Air Tonight"" as a prelude to a punch is a knockout; that even when the movie falters (the Taser scene) it picks up in no time (Ken Jeong and those Skittles? Wait for it). The Hangover aint art but Phillips has shaped the hardcore hilarity into the summer party movie of all our twisted dreams.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 04 2009 125PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Hangover Directed by Todd Phillips Written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore Starring Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis Classification 14A Rude lewd and occasionally in the nude The Hangover brings a collection of fresh faces to the familiar raucous male-bonding comedy. Todd Phillips ( Road Trip  Old School ) directed this low-brow but sporadically inspired movie and it has already earned a reputation as the boundary-pushing comedy movie of the summer thanks to word of mouth and clever preview trailers. Like Memento or Dude Wheres My Car? the movie turns on the question of amnesia. Three men take their soon-to-be-married friend Doug (Justin Bartha) for a blowout weekend in Las Vegas. After the first night the grooms friends wake up in a Caesars Palace suite with headaches and short-term memory deficits. A runaway bridegroom is one of several pressing problems The suite is trashed theres a tiger in the bedroom a baby in the closet and one of the friends is missing a tooth. As the men try to retrace their steps from the previous night they confront a fresh disaster about every five minutes until they find themselves still without Doug and on the lam from gangsters policemen and one seriously p.o.d prize-fighter. For at least the movies first hour Phillips spins these plot complications like a menacingly deft chainsaw juggler. At times this feels like a slightly milder version of Peter Bergs generally reviled Very Bad Things  a 1998 black comedy also about a Las Vegas bachelor party gone grotesquely awry. Although the script is credited to screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (the team behind the dismal Four Christmases and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past ) The Hangover is consistent with the directors previous frat-boy comedy hits. You could easily draw lines between the three men here and similar characters in Phillips 2003 Old School (played by Vince Vaughn Luke Wilson and Will Ferrell as respectively a married cynic a wounded romantic and a weird child-man). And the humour is less in the writing than in the improvisational skills of the cast. The swaggering alpha male of the group is Phil (Bradley Cooper of Hes Just Not That into You ) a married too-cool-for-school English teacher who is bored with his middle-class family life and naturally is the movies leading candidate for redemption. The most endearing is Stu (Ed Helms who plays Andy Bernard on The Office ) an insecure dentist and die-hard romantic who is bullied by his bad-tempered fiancee (Rachel Harris). The funniest of the three characters is the grooms shaggy misfit brother-in-law Alan (stand-up comic Zach Galifianakis). The deadpan Galifianakis emerges as the movies biggest scene-stealer playing a creepy childlike outsider who will do anything to be accepted. Not all the mens memories seem worth recovering but a couple of sequences stand out. Theres an extended appearance by Mike Tyson (in a celeb cameo like James Carvilles in Old School ) who is scary even with his Tweety Bird voice. Heather Graham shows up luminously vacant as stripper-hooker-single mom Jade in a performance that feels like a reprise of her Roller Girl role in Boogie Nights a dozen years ago. Outrageousness proves hard to sustain and after a stomach-lurchingly quick start The Hangover slows down and by the third act fizzes out like Alka-Seltzer in a highball glass. Funny turns queasy with jokes suggesting sexual abuse and with the arrival of a shrieking gay-Asian crime boss played by Ken Jeong ( Knocked Up  Role Models ). The bad-taste brinksmanship continues right through to the closing credits with a montage of photos aimed to make viewers walk out of the theatre wondering if they saw what they thought they saw. Criticizing a film like The Hangover for the weakness of its womens roles is like complaining that Sex and the City had no good car chases but its notable that apart from the Grahams hippie sex worker the women here arent much fun. At best like Dougs fiancee Tracy (Sasha Barrese) theyre beautiful forgiving and a bit imperious and when they crack the whip the wild boys resume their places. What do men really want? To be reminded that theyll live longer in a domesticated state apparently.

"Hangover The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hangover-the ) Hangover The (United States 2009) June 05 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Hangover begins and ends conventionally but in between its not afraid to go off the rails. Unlike most so-called ""comedies"" this one can claim the virtue of being reasonably funny. It never tries too hard the actors have a good sense of comedic timing and none of the jokes are drawn out for too long. And although The Hangover doesnt have the heart of say Knocked Up it displays an affection for its characters that most comedies dont. I wouldnt go so far as to claim the men and women populating the production are three-dimensional but they escape the low orbit of simple caricature. Theres a little more going on here than vulgar humor and that makes The Hangover worth the price of admission. The film begins with a teaser its the day of the wedding the groom is missing and his friends are in the middle of nowhere. One guy puts through a call to the bride and informs her that he ""lost"" her husband-to-be and the ceremony which is supposed to start in five hours ""isnt going to happen."" Cue the flashback which rewinds events 48 hours. Now we meet the principals before their fateful bachelor party trip to Las Vegas. Theres Dead Man Walking Doug (Justin Bartha) his best friends Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) and his soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis). The goal is for them to drive to Vegas spend the night gambling and drinking then go home the next day. Things dont go according to plan. When Phil Stu and Alan awaken the next morning in their 4200-a-night suite the place is a mess. A woman slips out the door before anyone else is conscious. A chicken is on the loose and theres a tiger in the bathroom. And whose baby is in the closet? Phil is wearing a hospital arm band. Stu has lost a tooth and gained a stripper (Heather Graham) for a wife. Meanwhile the center of the action Doug is missing (along with his beds mattress). When the bewildered trio (with infant in tow) who cant remember anything about the night before take a claim check to the hotels valet he brings them a cop car - not the ride they arrived in. All this happens before a tire iron-wielding naked Chinese guy and Phil Collins-singing Mike Tyson make appearances. The Hangover directed by Todd Phillips (Old School) with a similar flare for the profane and potentially offensive is as cleverly constructed as a comedy of this sort can be. The bulk of the film consists of Phil Stu and Alan attempting to reconstruct the lost night by following clues and re-connecting with people they dont remember (but who remember them). The humor grows out of these situations and most of it is not of the ""intellectual"" variety. The biggest laugh results from a scene thats in the trailer although it is funnier in context than it is as a snippet designed to lure people into the theater. The Mike Tyson cameo is truly bizarre and it takes on an almost macabre air after the real-life tragedy that has recently befallen him. ""In the Air Tonight"" is now cinematically wedded not only to Tom Cruise and Rebecca DeMornay but to Tyson as well. The lead actors play familiar types. Bradley Cooper probably the most recognizable name in the cast (not counting Tyson) is the leader of the pack although he avoids the ""asshole"" vibe that many such characters give off in other similar films thus making Phil more appealing than one might expect from such a slick individual. Stu is a nerd out of his depth whos tethered by a cellphone to his controlling girlfriend back home. Ed Helms plays him like a refugee from a Judd Apatow film. Finally theres overweight and socially awkward Alan whose personality Zach Galifianakis milks for humor without voiding the character of all vestiges of humanity. Alan is weird in ways that are sometimes uncomfortable and thats where about 50% of the movies comedy originates. The Hangover is unapologetically R-rated although its not as shocking as other recent raunchy comedies that have pushed the envelope. The majority of the nudity is provided by guys because as is generally acknowledged the naked male form is funnier than the naked female form. There are drinking and drugs profanity and bodily fluids but nothing we havent been exposed to before. The purpose of The Hangover isnt to boldly go where no comedy has gone before (although there is a subtle but unmistakable nod to Star Trek in the line ""Im a doctor not a tour guide"") but simply to make audiences laugh. With so many comedies becoming increasingly less funny as a result of the rise of lazy uninspired writing thats a worthy goal. For a viewer in the mood for something rude crude and lewd it would be difficult to find a more satisfying food.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + What on earth is ""The Trip besides hugely enjoyable? Its not a documentary since actors have been cast in minor roles and the two leads Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon are playing comic variations on their established personas of Spoiled Prat and Lovable Noodge. Its not scripted -- no writers are credited -- but improv is rarely this sure-footed. Its not really a movie since it was edited down from a six-episode BBC series but its not the original TV show either.If anything Michael Winterbottoms latest film -- his 25th in two decades more or less -- suggests a reality TV fusion of ""Sideways and a Bob Hope/Bing Crosby ""Road movie or maybe ""My Dinner With Andre repurposed into a movable feast. Both a gastronomic tour of northern England (that part seems real at least) and a hilarious battle of showbiz egos it takes particular delight in the sound of grown men bickering as fast and inventively as they can. Above all ""The Trip knows the special hell of being stuck in a car with a friend for a week. Maybe its a prison movie.The setup is this Coogan a well-known British TV personality and Hollywood demi-star (the masses remember him as Octavius in the ""Night at the Museum movies) has been signed up to pen a magazine article on the finer restaurants of the Lake District. His girlfriend (Margo Stilley) has backed out -- the two are ""on hiatus actually -- and he asks old chum and frequent costar Brydon to come along instead.If you saw these two in Winterbottoms marvelous ""Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story you know how well they work together and so it is here. Brydon is (or plays) a family man with a loving wife and new baby at home. Coogan is (or plays) a divorced dad with a roving eye happy to take advantage of his fame with a willowy hotel manager or freelance photographer. Brydon is unknown outside of England but cherished inside it; Coogan is admired but vaguely resented for his Hollywood airs. Brydons a mensch Coogans a bit of a -- well the word one character uses is extremely unprintable if more in use in England than here.One other thing Both men like to eat so ""The Trip regularly pauses at the tables of upscale restaurants like LEnclume Hipping Hall and the Yorke Arms while waiters trot out scallops pigeon rabbit and lamb -- and thats just one meal. The dishes can get baroque -- duck-fat lollipops anyone? -- and our heroes arent exactly practiced critics. ""The consistency is a bit like snot but it tastes great is how Coogan sums up a mysterious green broth.One other other thing Both Brydon and Coogan do impressions. Rather they do competitive impressions the way some men try to kill each other on the squash court. ""The Trip finds its lunatic groove on the very first evening as the two squabble over the proper approach to Michael Caine. Do you do the young Caine or the old Caine (the difference is two octaves)? Can you do the break in the actors voice when he gets emotional? This is more than a matter of professional pride; all the resentment and companionship each man feels for the other is in those warring Cockney diphthongs.The duel continues across the countryside and no one is spared not Anthony Hopkins Ian McKellan Richard Burton Hugh Grant Sean Connery Al Pacino nor even Woody Allen. Thankfully ""The Trip breaks into the occasional blissful freestyle as when Coogan and Brydon improvise a ""Braveheart-style period epic while driving across the moors (""To bed For tomorrow we rise at 830ish) or burrow into the meaning and majesty of ABBAs ""The Winner Takes It All.For all the inspired silliness ""The Trip nimbly balances joy and melancholy The pleasures of Britains back roads of communing with the shades of Coleridge and Wordsworth as well as the bitterness of the aging actors life. Coogans neuroses surface repeatedly both in comic form (why does Michael Sheen get all the good roles?) and with unexpectedly touching self-pity. To travel through ancient England in the 21st century is to be both in constant touch with the wired world and to be isolated from those who matter ones children wives lovers.Its a tricky juggling act and while the original TV series (as yet commercially unavailable here) developed it at leisure the theatrical version of ""The Trip is no less delirious or profound. ""Would you go to my funeral? asks Brydon in a moment of owlish introspection. ""Of course I would says Coogan. ""If only to pad out the numbers.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Some of the most memorable images in The Hangover come before the action even begins. The credits roll over forbidding shots of Las Vegas at dusk that suggest menace lurking just beneath the party-friendly surface. What happens there stays there were frequently told but what about the untold stories that end badly? The Hangover doesnt really run with that idea. In fact once it establishes its promising premise Todd Phillips film doesnt really run anywhere so much as amble. Its an agreeably unambitious comedy that might be called a romp if that word didnt imply a little too much energy. Groom-to-be Justin Bartha sets off for Vegas towing two of his best friends--uptight dentist Ed Helms and smooth-talking schoolteacher Bradley Cooper--and his odd future-brother-in-law Zach Galifianakis. After a rooftop toast the group hits the strip then wakes up the next day unable to recall the events of the night before adventures that left Helms missing a tooth; dropped a chicken a tiger and a baby in their suite; and took Bartha out of the picture entirely. In order to find their friend and return him to L.A. in time for the wedding they set out to piece together what the hell happened. Its a neat idea used as little more than a clothesline on which to hang some pretty soggy comic bits. The Taser gags that crop up when the gang gets arrested might be inevitable but do they have to go on for what feels like half the films running time? Cooper is all Vince Vaughn smarm with no Vince Vaughn vulnerability; Galifianakis at least brings some welcome unpredictability to the proceedings although that has as much to do with his reliably unnerving presence as anything hes given to do. Helms henpecked rage recalls some of the male anxiety on display in Phillips much better Old School but the screenplay by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (Ghosts Of Girlfriends Past etc.) keeps getting in the way of any spontaneity or depth. The moment the film threatens to let the cast--who barely seem like acquaintances much less friends--play off each other too much or attempts to turn into a comedy about anything rather than a bunch of incidents its on to the next round of mild amusement. Its a film about forgetting that seems designed to be forgotten.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Hangover   (out of four) Stars Bradley Cooper Ed Helms Zach Galifianakis Justin Bartha Heather GrahamDirector Todd PhillipsDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for pervasive language sexual content including nudity and some drug materialRunning time 1 hour 40 minutesOpens tonight in select theaters and Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The Hangover proves that high concept done right can work deliriously well. Its simple premise executed via an off-kilter narrative structure is made even more absurdly funny by an offbeat cast. The Hangover should be a big summer hit along the lines of 2005s The Wedding Crashers. Director Todd Phillips (Old School) has a knack for extreme scenarios and outside-the-box casting. He has made a movie that is consistently funny from start to finish. At the center of the mayhem is a likably weird trio whose chemistry works like gangbusters and fits seamlessly into the rowdy series of events. Doug (Justin Bartha) is two days from getting married and his two best pals Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) want to take him on a Vegas bachelor bash hell never forget. They are joined by Dougs future brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis) a not-all-there bearded fellow dubbed ""Fat Jesus"" by a police officer. Phil is a married schoolteacher who likes to party and Stu is a dentist cowed by his girlfriend. Alan is like a child with facial hair. The guys drop a few thousand on a garish Caesars Palace suite and meet on the rooftop for a toast. When they wake up everything around them is trashed. A baby boy strapped in his carrier cries out from a closet. And theres no sign of the groom-to-be. Without a clue as to what happened the three set out to piece things together and find Doug. Their odyssey is uproariously funny thanks to a clever screenplay by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. Though the film falters toward the end The Hangover is a side-splitting adventure youll still be laughing about the morning after. (Rated R for pervasive language sexual content including nudity and some drug material. Running time 1 hour 40 minutes. Opens tonight in select theaters and Friday nationwide.)

More about The Trip >> Its the subject of many films often made by wizened exasperated artists - Woody Allens ""Hollywood Ending"" Robert Altmans ""The Player."" Michael Winterbottoms ""The Trip"" is about another less-celebrated rivalry in movies - the one between art and entertainment embodied here by Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. Theyre essentially playing themselves - Coogan the former comedian who wants to be a serious actor Brydon the popular comic and impressionist who wants to be a popular comic and impressionist. In ""The Trip"" they tour the British countryside and as they bop from Bamp;B to Bamp;B Coogans pretensions to art and Brydons contentment with entertainment become more pronounced - Coogan is always on the phone with his agents turning down a lowbrow TV series to pursue a prestigious independent film. Brydon for his part is pursuing laughs. Hes entertaining the waiters and fellow diners signing autographs charming the hotel staff. Slowly surely the adulation drives Coogan crazy. He never says it overtly but you can see exasperation in his face Why isnt there more sympathy with my struggle to make great art? Why are you laughing so hard at Brydons umpteenth Michael Caine impersonation? Well because its pee-your-pants funny. There is an already legendary scene in ""The Trip"" of Brydon and Coogan squaring off over dinner to see who can do the best Caine. Theyre both excellent but what makes the scene so good - what makes it art - is the way it illustrates the movies themes. Brydon is trying to capture Caines voice his mannerisms. Hes a mimic. Coogan is trying to get the ""essence"" of Caine. Hes an artist. Its clever its brilliant and its also about halfway through ""The Trip."" The movie is . . . leisurely. Winterbottom takes what is essentially a two-character piece - ""My Road Trip With Andre"" - and lets it run for 130 minutes. The movie is cut down from a six-hour British TV series but needs to be cut a good deal more. We eventually get to the epilogue wherein the entertainer and artist return to their homes. There Brydon is as content as he is elsewhere in life - his wife and son greet him enthusiastically. Coogan is restless rootless unhappy alone. That may be glib but it also seems fair. You dont become an artist to be happy or employed or well-compensated. But you can still do a pretty good Michael Caine.

The conceit is that Coogan tall and Byronic with his deceptively sweet egomaniacal sharks grin gets a magazine assignment to review a dozen outrageously pretentious country restaurants in the chilly north of England. For company he brings along his friend and colleague a rubber-faced Welsh-born impressionist (Brydon). The entire movie consists of these two driving eating and talking. They do their dueling impersonations of Michael Caine (the funniest scene of the year). They trade quips insults poems and philosophies. They sing wistful snatches of ABBA and Kate Bush. Directed by Michael Winterbottom and based on a largely improvised BBC sitcom of the same name The Trip looks like a lark -- and is -- yet theres a sneaky resonance to the way it celebrates what acting means to these two rogue cutups. In this movie to pretend to be someone you arent is the best way to reach outside of yourself to fashion your voice into a kind of explorer an instrument of empathy. Thats never more true than when these two backbiting chums reveal how much they like each other by brilliantly enacting the roles of two people who dont like each other.

The Trip Great Director Michael Winterbottom. Cast Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. Rating Unrated but contains adult themes and some sexual content. Note At UltraStar Scottsdale. | Showtimes New movies releases this week This is not a pitch that would cut it in Hollywood but thankfully director Michael Winterbottom never much thinks about what Hollywood wants. Winterbottoms ""The Trip"" mostly delights as the filmmaker follows Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon on a trek to review half a dozen restaurants. Its a continuation of the riffing Coogan and Brydon did on their real personas in Winterbottoms ""Tristram Shandy A Cock and Bull Story"" as the two friends prattle trade insults do hilarious impersonations and generally try to one-up each other. The result is occasionally repetitive and borders on tiresome now and then. Yet Coogan and Brydon building their performances largely through improvisation have such rapport that its easy to digest their brand of affectionate chatter laced with mildly meanspirited ribbing. If you were sitting at the next table and overheard these guys cataloging the rights and wrongs of each others talents and career choices you might roll your eyes at their pettiness. If you overheard their vocal duels as they mimic such actors as Al Pacino Michael Caine and the various men who have played James Bond youd likely be snorting with laughter and telling the waiter ""Give me whatever theyre having."" ""The Trip"" is a big-screen condensation of Winterbottoms six-part series that aired on British television. Playing a loose version of himself Coogan (who also starred in Winterbottoms ""24 Hour Party People"" and had a small but memorable role in ""Tropic Thunder"") takes an assignment to review restaurants in a resort area of rural northwest England. On the outs with his girlfriend and unable to get anyone else to come along Coogan invites pal and sometime colleague Brydon (known mainly as a British TV-comedy star and panel-show host) to join him. Along the way they bicker chortle debate the classic English poets and dissect each others personal and professional lives with chummy slyness and more than a little spite. Coogans the diva always aiming to position himself as the alpha male of the two yet he lets deep insecurities show through as his character ponders his successes and failures against Brydons self-assuredness and satisfaction with his lot in life. The meals themselves and particularly Coogan and Brydons reactions to the delicacies they consume drag on a bit. ""The Trip"" often is at its best when the two are on the move passing the driving time with hysterically funny reimaginings of Hollywood costume-drama dialogue or speculating about the Brits who came before them while visiting historical landmarks. Winterbottom punctuates their trip with gorgeous shots of the rolling countryside images lovingly complemented by spare pastoral music from Michael Nyman. The film closes with snapshots of Coogan and Brydon readjusting once they return to their lives in the city. It provides a very authentic sense of that dreamlike feeling people often have coming home from a trip. Youre tired youre glad to be back in familiar surroundings yet you still feel in motion and maybe regret losing that sense of freedom disconnection and camaraderie you had while away from it all. ""The Trip"" also leaves you contemplating what youve seen through Coogan and Brydons eyes - and feeling kind of sorry that youve parted ways with them.

A shaggy intermittently hilarious wish-fulfillment nightmare about sorta dissatisfied sorta middle-aged dudesters trying to capture the Ghost of Keggers Past by running their own frat house director Todd Phillipss squirmy comedy struck a nerve with almost every forty-ish daddy I know. It captured the gnawing suspicion among the newly gray that whatever fun were having cant possibly measure up to the fun were supposed to be having--or worse the fun we were supposed to have had way back when.To allay those fears in all of us theres Americas rec-room--the beacon of Las Vegas promising a wallow in Caligulan depravity (plus comped buffets). That would make it the perfect setting for an Old School 2--and in Phillipss The Hangover it arguably is. A second slice of three-handed men-will-be-toddlers tomfoolery just as uneven and almost as funny this messy raunchy farce about three groomsmen on a lost-weekend bender in Sin City continues the directors fascination with the alpha males default setting--childhood reversion. To put it another way This is a movie about three yutzes who go to Vegas for a bachelor party lose the groom and wake up face-down in a high rollers suite with live chickens a smoldering armchair and a Jacuzzi full of inflatable livestock.Dude wheres my groom? Ringleader Phil (Bradley Cooper) a teacher who siphons gambling money off his grade-schoolers has a hospital bracelet but no memory. Henpecked Stu (Ed Helms) a dentist--sorry doctor--all but floss-bound to his suspicious fiancee has an 800 ATM receipt but is missing a tooth. Found it Its in the pocket of Alan (Zach Galifianakis) the brides brother and an incorrigible skeev.As their search for groom Doug (Justin Bartha) leads from cut-rate wedding chapel to no-tell motel the screenplay by hot high-concept-of-the-moment team Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (Ghosts of Girlfriends Past Four Christmases) strives mightily to strew banana peels in their path--most amusing some merely desperate.What proves consistent as it did in Old School is the chemistry among Hangovers three species of party mammalia. Cooper well-cast as the detestable Sack in Wedding Crashers has the smarmy look of an avocational gynecologist; his Phil is the closest thing the movie has to a straight man wedged in between a Felix Unger neatnik and an Oscar Madison slob. As the former Helms uses his wall-mounted Whiffenpoof features to manic effect with a girlish shriek for each new catastrophe. As the latter the ursine Galifianakis a master at detonating sicko one-liners with a slow fuse adopts a gut-forward toddle and an air of guileless hedonism. (Hes left in charge of an abandoned baby who rides on his chest as a human airbag; the astoundingly inappropriate trick he teaches the little guy leaves no doubt why hes persona non grata at Chuck E. Cheese.) Together they form a lopsided portrait of flabby shabby wannabe machismo--an instant rejoinder to the old taunt ""man up.""That makes them ideal subjects for director Phillips among whose earliest films was the still-startling Frat House--a 1998 documentary for which the director underwent Hell Week hazing on camera and emerged with a grudging love-hate for his ""brothers"" that was not unlike Stockholm Syndrome. Starting with his teen-sex opus Road Trip hes given himself perverted little cameos in his features as if to remind mainstream viewers of his roots in the New York Underground Film Festival and the GG Allin documentary Hated. But the feeling that comes through in his megaplex movies from Road Trip on is closer to late mellow John Waters. He cant bring himself to push the material into truly outre territory or to characterize his growth-impaired guys as degenerate creeps rather than lovable scamps.If that gives The Hangover a certain failure of nerve it also makes the movie like Old School and Road Trip an unusually palatable entry in a rancid genre. Phillipss use of his Vegas locale is pretty facile but at least he draws on the iconography of the celluloid Strip from Rain Man to Casino to show his characters struggling to meet the culture-set standards of ""what happens in Vegas""--not a bad metaphor for being a man. It would resonate more if The Hangovers female characters werent such nonentities Either theyre two-timing ball-busting sluts (Rachael Harris as Stus girl deserves hazard pay) easy-going nurturing whores (Heather Grahams part evaporates on-screen) or glorified extras. But considering what passes for a mans mans mans world in Todd Phillipss movies women may feel grateful for their relative absence.

The trailers and TV spots suggest its just another beer-and-boobs party-hearty farce but ""The Hangover"" is surprisingly clever as well as R-rated rowdy. At once raucously free-wheeling and meticulously contrived pic satisfies as a boys-gone-wild laff riot that also clicks as a seriocomic beat-the-clock detective story. Reviews and word-of-mouth could help this profanely funny comedy exceed expectations and achieve the status of breakout hit. Homevid biz should be equally impressive after a leggy summertime theatrical run. Helmer Todd Phillips (""Old School"" ""Road Trip"") grabs attention right from the get-go with an edgy-funny prologue that triggers an extended flashback. Its a smart move in that the vaguely foreboding intro adds an intriguing undercurrent to the comedy in otherwise ordinary (if not generic) expository scenes. Two days before he ties the knot with his rich and gorgeous fiancee blandly affable Doug (Justin Bartha) takes off for a brief Las Vegas sojourn with three groomsmen His two best buddies -- Phil (Bradley Cooper) a cynical and sardonic high school teacher and Stu (Ed Helms) a dentist usually kept on a tight leash by his nagging girlfriend (a truly monstrous Rachel Harris) -- and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) Dougs future brother-in-law a lumpy lunk whos all too eager to befriend and belong. Even with odd-man-out Alan along for the ride the bachelor-partiers enjoy a wild night of booze-fueled revelry in Sin City. The next morning however three of them awaken in their posh hotel suite with only the haziest of memories about the previous evenings events and no explanation at all for the snarling tiger in their bathroom and the crying baby in their closet. Worse they have no earthly idea what happened to the inexplicably missing Doug. Exhibiting an ingenuity one might not expect from the same writers who gave us ""Four Christmases"" and ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"" scripters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore provide one uproarious pay-off after another as the groomsmen frantically scramble to retrace their steps so they can reconnect with the misplaced (or quite possibly waylaid) groom. Their circuitous journey brings them in contact with among others Taser-wielding cops angry Asian gamblers a perky stripper (a chipper Heather Graham) with newly forged ties to Stu and an unexpectedly equanimous but not infinitely patient Mike Tyson (played in a bold stroke of casting by Tyson). Early on its revealed that the revelers werent merely drunk they were drugged while cutting an antic swath through the Vegas night world. Oddly enough thats just enough to anchor the pic in something like real-world logic even as the plot takes ever more outlandish twists and turns. In fact its tempting to read ""The Hangover"" as a wild-and-crazy spin on a scenario that would have been entirely suitable for a deadly serious 40s film noir. The humor is unapologetically raunchy -- a closing-credits photo montage includes some borderline NC-17 naughtiness -- and sporadically brutal. Helmer Phillips sustains an overall tone of anything-goes swagger that he neatly subverts with steadily mounting desperation and ego-deflating humiliations. Throughout it all however Cooper Helms and even Galifianakis (whose character comes closest to caricature) remain sufficiently disciplined to refrain from going too far over the top. Bartha does well in a thankless role but hes simply not visible long enough to make as much impact. On the other hand Ken Jeong makes the absolute most of his limited screen time as an effete antagonist whose mincing trash talk likely will be quoted extensively by the pics fans. Lenser Lawrence Sher does an excellent job of subtly enhancing the sense of danger lying just below the comic surface. Other tech credits are fine. Jokey references to ""Rain Man"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" are amusing but not nearly as funny as the pics self-aware reference to the cliched notion that theres nothing as hilarious as a pratfall by a fat man.
