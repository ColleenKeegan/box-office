International prospects look brighter as do down-the-line ancillary returns. Independent-style edge meets international espionage in ""The Bourne Identity"" a first-rate thriller with grit and intrigue to spare. With ""Swingers"" and ""Go"" director Doug Liman stepping up in a big way with his first big-budget major studio effort this reworking of a 23-year-old Cold War spy novel by the late Robert Ludlum convinces on two levels as an account of CIA ruthlessness that seems cold-bloodedly realistic rather than cheaply cynical and as a character piece about an amnesia-afflicted agency assassin who doesnt like what he learns when he finally realizes who he is. Matt Damons solo B.O. draw will be tested by this distinctively European-feeling suspenser which may not be viewer-friendly enough for a portion of the mainstream Yank audience and will probably rack up mid-range rather than boffo domestic biz. International prospects look brighter as do down-the-line ancillary returns. Damon plays the thoroughly equivocal title character a highly trained killing machine whose body in the dramatic opening is scooped out of the Mediterranean by some fishermen. Coaxed from the edge of death the young man has two bullets in his back as well as a capsule encoded with a Swiss bank account number. Since he has no memory of who he is where he lives or what he does he gratefully accepts a handout from his rescuer and heads for Zurich. What he finds in the safe deposit box throws him for a loop multiple passports including an American one identifying him as Jason Bourne a gun and stacks of currency. Taking it all with him he heads for the American consulate where security goons move in on him and he narrowly escapes by hiring a ride to Paris from the attractively disheveled German ""gypsy"" Marie (Franka Potente) for 10000. But while Bourne cant figure out why everyones after him the audience is clued in early on. Back in Langley CIA officer Ted Conklin (Chris Cooper) head of a top secret clandestine operation is furious that Bourne has botched a hit on a former African leader whos threatening to blackmail the agency. Now that the agent has resurfaced he puts out the word ""I want Bourne in a body bag by sundown."" Thus is the film put on track as a relentless chase with killers every bit as tough and resourceful as Bourne himself regularly smashing through windows and taking surprise sniper shots just as the French police repeatedly come within a hair of nailing him. Format provides as many opportunities for suspense set pieces close calls and narrow escapes as one could want but the spectacle of a runaway CIA assassin being hunted by his own creates an emotional dynamic of almost chilling ambivalence On the one hand a viewer almost automatically sympathizes with the central figure (especially a young and attractive one) in a drama pitting him against a sinister ""them""; on the other hand its never forgotten that Bourne before his blown job was fully one of ""them."" Although it would seem prudent for Marie to escape harms way by parting company with Bourne once they hit Paris she proves useful to him on more than one occasion. And as the beset fellow has let down his guard with her as to his memory blank she shortly feels emboldened to initiate some physicality with him which he tenderly reciprocates. What could easily have been a hokey cutesy or implausible (or all three) romance is given credible texture by not forcing it too much and just keeping Marie in the picture while both characters decide how far they want to take things. Offbeat casting of the sexy but not typically beautiful Potente is also a big help; shes warm earthy and sans actressy airs and even has a fleck of ""Run Lola Run"" red left in her hair. As the pressure mounts on Conklin to bring in his loose-cannon operative Bourne gradually gleans more about himself especially after the African politician is killed in a spectacular hit by another CIA gun (Clive Owen). Latter is inevitably then sent after Bourne resulting in a fantastic sequence in which the two equally trained and ruthless men who ostensibly work for the same team stalk each other through woods and fields. Theres more as Conklin himself finally pursues Bourne to Paris and the action-filled but bitter climax is entirely of a piece with whats come before dramatically tonally and philosophically. Although a brief sun-drenched coda brightens matters in an only semi-plausible way at the very end it does nothing to erase the consistency and coherence of a picture that succeeds in its evident aim to darkly recast the espionage genre for a new generation. Working from a tight and dense script by Tony Gilroy and William Blake Herron Liman extends the bristling style he developed in ""Go"" in new directions here as he fulfills traditional story expectations and does the requisite globetrotting without imposing stale conventions upon the audience. Camerawork by Oliver Wood is agile and always on the move (Liman did much of the operating himself) and terrific wintry locations in Paris Prague and coastal Italy help bring the film to vibrant life. Action is intense never more so than in a standout car chase through tiny Parisian back streets alleys and even stairways although Limans technique falls a bit short in the hand-to-hand combat scenes; helmer tends to cut with every hit and kick rather than letting shots hold resulting in disjointed coverage that hides much of whats happening. Acting is unusually fine for this sort of genre piece. Damon for one has never been this good. For the first time actor doesnt seem to care if the audience likes him or not and while he will always be the most inescapably American-looking of all contempo actors he has been induced to shed his wholesomeness and all traces of naivete to play a real hard case with deeply buried vestiges of a conscience and emotional reachability. He is also completely convincing in the scenes in which he is required to speak other languages well notably French and German. Cooper is outstanding as the pitiless CIA brain bedeviled by a vexing crisis and Brian Cox supplies the needed gravitas as his concerned superior. Nothing special is made of it but rising star Julia Stiles puts in a surprise appearance in the very secondary part of Conklins secret point person in Paris. Working solo in a lonely safe house this beautiful smart Ivy League-type has somehow found her way into a strange risky sporadically exciting job at a very young age. Role is really a throwaway but emphasizing it via such striking casting makes one imagine a film centered upon this woman about how she got where she is and where she goes from here. Techno-slanted score by John Powell is tremendously propulsive combining with Potentes presence to remind viewers at times of ""Run Lola Run."" Yarn was dramatized once before as a 1988 four-hour ABC miniseries starring Richard Chamberlain and Jaclyn Smith.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"The Bourne Identity is a soothing thriller; The Fast Runner is no ethnographic slog. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Bourne Identity is a soothing thriller; The Fast Runner is no ethnographic slog. The Bourne Identity is a soothing thriller; The Fast Runner is no ethnographic slog. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 14 2002 1242 PM Four Days of the Cipher The Bourne Identity is a soothingly mundane amnesia thriller; The Fast Runner is anything but a ceremonial ethnographic slog. By David Edelstein Matt Damon as Jason Bourne Matt Damon is a fine young actor not expansive but intensely focused which makes him just right for the amnesiac hero of the trim thriller The Bourne Identity (Universal). The movie is a generic paranoid espionage fantasy but its proportions are refreshingly correct. It moves quickly adroitly and without fuss; it doesnt give you time to reflect on the inanity--and the Cold War datedness--of its premise. Amnesia is always a dicey plot device and The Bourne Identity pushes it to unprecedented heights of illogic. Its protagonist whos found floating off the coast of Marseilles with two bullets in his back and the number of a Zurich safe-deposit box in some sort of laser body-implant has no idea who he is. But he has somehow retained lightning martial-arts reflexes fluency in a handful of languages and the wired instincts of a superspy. Advertisement An actor like Damons pal Ben Affleck who specializes in shallow guys suddenly out of their depth might have played the gulf between comprehension and prowess for campy laughs; but Damon keeps his expression furtive through screeching chases and bone-crunching fisticuffs. The recessiveness of Damons personality makes it easy to imagine the character blanking on his own identity He is wittily contained. So is the movie. Its best moment makes a joke of the poker-faced tone. After a hair-raising car chase Damon and Franke Potente--as the down-on-her-luck chatterbox whom he pays to drive him to Paris--sit in stunned silence dumbly processing the hell theyve just been through the hysteria all the more evident for being repressed. Its Potentes character who gives the movie heart. Shes wary but smitten and she seems to be having the time of her life until she realizes that at any second it could be terminated with extreme prejudice. The director Doug Liman gave his last feature Go (1999) such a headily syncopated syntax that its ultimate lack of substance was a slap in the face I loved his virtuoso technique but felt hustled by the movies coy non-resolution. Limans work is less ostentatiously inventive here which is better for the material. The Bourne Identity recalls the chill low-key efficiency of The Day of the Jackal (1973) and Three Days of the Condor (1975); it could have been called Four Days of theCipher. Probably the most animated character is a beleaguered CIA agent (Chris Cooper) who bellows things like ""I want Bourne in a body bag by sundown"" As Damon and Potente wander around Western Europe in search of his past robotic assassins (the deadliest played by Clive Owen) are dispatched by an even more robotic Julia Stiles who sits before a bank of monitors and short-wave radios. Stiles is a star and potentially a major actress and most of the audience will assume that her character is going to end up in the thick of things. Er no. Her non-presence is a bigger brain-teaser than the identity of Bourne. Was she dating someone on the crew? The Robert Ludlum novel thats the movies source has a more original--if convoluted--outcome but there is something soothingly nostalgic about the mundane conspiracy at the core of the film It summons up a thriller era when the only people who ever seemed to die were spies counterspies and the odd overweening dictator or Party apparatchik. After 9/11 a world of old white guys playing Cold War chess with sundry operatives feels positively quaint. A scene from The Fast Runner The Canadian Inuit saga The Fast Runner (Atanarjuat) (Lot 47) directed by Zacharias Kunuk is one of the most enthralling three hours youll ever spend at the theater. No make that one of the most enthralling two-and-a-half hours The first 30 minutes make you think youre in for a ceremonial ethnographic slog with people you can barely tell apart (if youre not an Inuit that is) sitting in smoky dimly lit igloos chewing walrus meat and belching loudly. Eventually you get your bearings and the primordial power of this ancient legend--set in the northernmost regions of the Arctic--begins to take hold. This is not the Great White North of Insomnia with its breathtaking crags and cold-sharpened clarity. The landscape of The Fast Runner is barren and flat and stretches out so endlessly that you can practically see the curvature of the Earth. Early on the nomadic protagonist Atanarjuat (Natar Ungalaaq) runs afoul of the dog-kicking patricidal rapist villain Oki (Peter-Henry Arnatsiaq) when he wins the hand of the demure Atuat (Sylvia Ivalu) in a sort of head-bashing contest. ""I wolf you"" he tells her. Having settled down with the Eskimo of his dreams he makes the mistake of going caribou-hunting with Okis slatternly sister Puja whom he takes after mutual serenading and hot sex as his second wife. It was evidently no easier to juggle two women in the 11th century than it is now and soon Puja is whining to her brother who comes after Atanarjuat with spears blazing. You will recognize the second half of the film--its like Yojimbo or A Fistful of Dollars a Clint Eastwood picture in Inuktitut. That doesnt make it any less astounding however. You have never seen a sequence like the one in which the hero buck naked runs for his life from the raging Oki and his pals through endless expanses of snow and ice water his feet cut to ribbons toward a sun that never sets. Even with the slightly hazy digital video image the pale slanted northern light makes the men seem like wraiths. It is a landscape of the soul--an apt setting for the primal revenge drama both rough and sacred that is among the first and most momentous of all stories.

"Bourne Identity The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bourne-identity-the ) Bourne Identity The (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli In all likelihood Robert Ludlum fans will not be pleased by this adaptation of one of the spy masters best-received novels. Thats because The Bourne Identity uses the premise a few character names and some isolated incidents from the novel then runs off in its own direction. This film has less in common with its print inspiration than The Sum of All Fears but considering the inherent differences between books and movies thats not necessarily a bad thing. The divergence allows The Bourne Identitys cinematic incarnation to be judged on its own strengths and weaknesses without being repeatedly compared to the book - a problem that the 1988 mini-series had. That production (which starred a wooden Richard Chamberlain) made the mistake of trying to be faithful to Ludlums text; consequently events had a rushed feel as if too much had been crammed into four hours. However this version of The Bourne Identity is nicely paced and fits the bill for those in search of two hours of spy-based action and martial arts. The movie has credibility issues but none are insurmountable in the name of entertainment. The Bourne Identity doesnt have much of a story to speak of - the plot is a jumping-off point and a means to keep things rolling from one action sequence to the next. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is a CIA assassin who loses his memory after a failed mission that results in him being shot twice and left floating in the ocean. However while Jason doesnt know exactly who (or what) he is he recognizes that someone is after him and his training kicks in. That ""someone"" is his boss Ted Conklin (Chris Cooper) who sees Bourne as a loose end that has to be eliminated. Jason meets Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente) a German wanderer who leaps at the chance to earn 20000 by driving Jason to his Paris apartment. Once there however they encounter hit men and dead bodies and Jason decides that the only way to save himself is to find out who he is and why someone wants him dead. Although it would be a stretch to call Matt Damon a perfect spy - there are times when his underplaying causes him to come across as emotionless - hes more credible in the action hero role than his friend Ben Affleck. If it came down to Damons Bourne versus Afflecks Jack Ryan my money would be on the former. Not only is he more buff but hes got some cool moves. Damon generates a little nice chemistry with on-screen love interest Franka Potente who has been getting a fair amount of international exposure since Run Lola Run. In fact considering the pacing and high level of action in this film The Bourne Identity could easily be called Run Jason Run. At any rate its tension of the action-oriented variety not the romantic one that drives The Bourne Identity. While the movie pays lip service to solving the ""mystery"" of Jasons identity this is pretty much a red herring. We figure things out early in the proceedings so there are no surprises around the corner. The real question posed by the screenplay is how Jason will survive the hit men sent after him especially the deadly Professor (Clive Owen) who seems to be his equal. In addition to a number of high-octane fight scenes and some cat-and-mouse games the movie contains a lengthy car chase through the streets of Paris. And while this one is a little more exciting than the average high-speed pursuit it doesnt offer enough thats new daring or heart-pounding and as a result seems a little too long and drawn-out. The Bourne Identity is directed by Swingers helmsman Doug Liman who proves himself to be capable of generating and sustaining suspense. He starts out early by using point-of-view shots to develop a sense of paranoia as Jason awakens and tries to assess the unfamiliar world around him. Liman occasionally returns to that trick throughout the film whenever he feels that putting us into Jasons shoes will ratchet up the tension. It works particularly well during a scene in Jasons Paris apartment when the first hit-man makes his appearance. Through Jason we sense hes coming but his appearance is nevertheless startling. On some level I guess The Bourne Identity could be considered a throwback. There are not many pure action thrillers out there these days. This movie does not rely on special effects or science fiction-like plot elements to get by. Its a straightforward story of good guys against bad guys with most of the moral ambiguities leeched out. (For example Liman doesnt expect us to be overly concerned with Jasons past as a ruthless killer. Thats another lifetime - because of his amnesia Jason has been ""bourne again"".) No matter who comes out on top this is the kind of movie where the audience - at least an audience looking for 120 minutes of adrenaline-propelled escapism - wins.

Starring Matt Damon and Franka Potente. Directed by Doug Liman. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 112 minutes.) ""The Bourne Identity"" takes the espionage thriller and gives it a modern sensibility. In place of a dour hero in control we find a young Everyman just stumbling through. In place of a Cold War world of clear-cut good guys and villains we find one in which everybodys wrong more or less and the world is just messy and absurd. There are moments that are just on the edge of silly but thats the idea. Director Doug Liman intentionally walks a careful line. He plays it straight enough that the movie generates the suspense of a traditional thriller but he keeps one toe and sometimes two in the zone of farce. The result is not only entertaining but also refreshing a shameless crowd-pleaser with a healthy cynicism about itself. Based on the 1980 novel by the late Robert Ludlum the picture stars Matt Damon as Bourne a young man with amnesia who wakes up on an Italian fishing boat suffering from two bullet wounds. He has no idea who he is but he does have a Swiss bank account number implanted behind his ear so a trip to Zurich seems in order. From the beginning Liman does two things worth noting. First he films European cities in a way that makes us feel were there. The streets may be picturesque but they also look old and narrow and if not sinister at least coldly impassive as though people have been getting murdered here for centuries. Liman also doesnt miss an opportunity to create a sense of unease. For example when Bourne gets to the bank he is greeted by a receptionist (Kait Denison) whose manner is unsettling -- not menacing or hostile or anything easy to identify just strange. As a consequence we share Bournes discomfort Everywhere he goes hes walking in blindfolded. Damon makes Bourne easy to like playing him as a decent young fellow genuinely bemused by each turn of events. He keeps discovering powers he didnt know he had. He speaks several languages fluently. He also can fight. Two Swiss cops approach him with billy clubs and within seconds he beats them unconscious. His safety deposit box only confuses him further. ""Who has a safety deposit box with money six passports and a gun?"" he says. Many movies are about young men searching for their own identity in a hostile world. ""The Bourne Identity"" takes this plotline and renders it literal. The cops are after him in three different countries. Assassins are trying to kill him. If he walks down the street he gets recognized. If he gets in a car its a car chase. Most of the movie pairs Damon with Franka Potente who plays Marie a young Swiss woman whom he pays to drive him to Paris. Potente (""Run Lola Run"") an exceptional actress doesnt get to do much here but react to catastrophe and look dewy-eyed at Damon. But she does manage to suggest if only in her manner a woman so wild and aimless that she takes pleasure in the chaos Bourne brings. ""The Bourne Identity"" takes place against an international background that to its participants seems gravely important but to us seems zany. A lunatic African leader (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is threatening to embarrass the CIA by naming his contacts and suits in the agency are scrambling to control the damage. One of them is played by Brian Cox who goes through the movie scowling like Nixon. Another is his henchman played by Chris Cooper the kind of fellow who sits behind a desk and in a Southern accent says things like ""I want Bourne in a body bag by sundown."" ""The Bourne Identity"" shows that Limans deadpan farcical directorial personality is adaptable enough to give life to an old genre. . This movie contains violence.

Hollywood has yet to release any battle films that were made after the sad awakening of September 11 but the pictures that were kicked into development by ""Saving Private Ryans"" success are establishing new boundaries for onscreen violence. ""Windtalkers"" is a textbook World War II melodrama with enough carnage to convince the ""Black Hawk Down"" crowd that its an unflinching depiction of real combat. Well maybe it is and maybe it isnt. But no amount of burning blasting stabbing and shooting can hide a weak script. This is supposed to be the story of Pvt. Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach) one of the many Navajo radio operators who relayed combat instructions during World War II via a code that was based on their native language. The enemy never managed to break the code -- Japan and Germany had no Navajos -- but that didnt stop them from torturing any apparent American Indians they captured to see if theyd spit out the answers. So Yahzee is teamed up with Sgt. Joe Enders (Nicolas Cage) a physically and spiritually wounded combat veteran whose mission is to protect Yahzee ... or to kill him if it looks like hes about to fall into enemy hands.

"USATODAY.com - Bourne plays old-school spy game Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/14/2002 - Updated 1211 AM ET Bourne plays old-school spy game By Mike Clark USA TODAY Matt Damon and Franka Potente act in a scene from their new film The Bourne Identity. The Bourne Identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups. Doug Limans directorial style honed on Swingers and Go is too fresh and kinetic for him to deliver a movie that seems old-fashioned. And yet heres the kind of expertly cast action-intrigue that played well in the 50s and 60s when backed by air conditioning on a 90-degree evening. Matt Damon is an amnesiac hit man and spy whos exasperated by his circumstances -- the same predicament that Richard Chamberlain faced in the much longer and clunkier 1988 TV movie of the late Robert Ludlums novel. There the resemblance ends. The TV version pulled off the feat of making Chamberlain seem like a hardened veteran but here were struck by how young Damon looks which turns out not to be a problem. When he breaks into one of the many frustrated rages he takes out on assailant torsos Damon is more convincing than expected as one who thrives on bad will hunting. The Bourne Identity (out of four) Stars Matt Damon Franka Potente Chris Cooper Clive Owen Julia Stiles Brian Cox Director Doug Liman Distributor Universal Rating PG-13 for violence and some language The rage comes honestly. Floating near-dead in the rainy Mediterranean with bullets in his back and an implanted chip elsewhere in his body hes rescued by a fishing vessel. The chip which contains a Swiss bank account number leads him to a Zurich safe-deposit box containing a fortune in world currency and a half-dozen passports in multiple names (Bourne is just one) that are supposed to be his. It also leads him to near-assassination every time he steps into a new building. When the action minus clueless Damon suddenly cuts to CIA headquarters in Langley Va. its clear experts are pulling his strings. The inevitable woman who falls into his life is played by Run Lola Runs Franka Potente a German actress with a different hair color in every movie. Here she has three in the course of saving Damons hide or offering him support during ambushes fights and one of the few novel spins on a movie car chase in a while. The CIA describes her as a gypsy but Potentes character is smart and attractive -- and less polished than her miniseries counterpart Jaclyn Smith. You sense that Chamberlain and Smith ate in four-star restaurants. Damon and Potente seem more like cafe types. Blisteringly fast Bourne also has a strong or striking supporting actor around every corner Chris Cooper Brian Cox Julia Stiles and Clive Owen in roles that range from meaty to amazingly small. Whats more the locales -- or what reviewers always used to call ""scenic values"" -- make the difference between a decent espionage outing and a very good one. All-purpose Prague stands in for Zurich and Paris but my favorite vista is the Greek island of Mykonos in the final scene set near the water in a modest shop. Set me up with a satellite dish and a pile of books and Ill sleep on a cot there for life.

Damons character Jason Bourne is some sort of black-ops shadow agent on assignment in Europe; after getting injured in a mysterious fracas he has lost touch with any memory of who he is or how he got there. The movie has a few whispers of intrigue but at its heart lies a dispiriting paradox The more that Jason Bourne learns about himself the less arresting he seems. ""The Bourne Identity"" plays like John Le Carre with a couple of burned-out cylinders. The film wants us to look at these CIA superkillers and say How ominous. Instead a lot of viewers may now think As if or even If only. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.
