Case in point In a scene midway through the movie a group of men in a small-town barbershop croon the Paul Simon tune ""Loves Me Like a Rock."" Its a terrific toe-tapping moment sung with heart and dash by the classic Ramp;B group the OJays -- and director Jonathan Lynn cuts abruptly out of it halfway through the song so as to go grocery shopping next door with Cuba Gooding Jr. and Beyonce Knowles. Um what? Let the men sing The film which will remind many of ""Sister Act"" minus the nuns stars Gooding as Darren Hill a fast-talker who returns home to Monte Carlo Ga. for his aunts funeral only to learn that he must lead the churchs gospel choir to success as her final wish. Trouble is nobody in town can sing. No worries; theres those dudes at the barbershop and the jazz-singing single mom (Knowles) down the street and a handful of random convicts -- and hey some of those church ladies turn out to have pipes as free-spirited as their Sunday hats. Movie review 1/2 ""The Fighting Temptations"" with Cuba Gooding Jr. Beyonce Knowles Mike Epps LaTanya Richardson Steve Harvey. Directed by Jonathan Lynn from a screenplay by Elizabeth Hunter and Saladin K. Patterson. 123 minutes. Rated PG-13 for some sexual references. Several theaters. Its all pleasant enough if overlong particularly in every scene involving the beautiful Knowles whos almost too relaxed on screen. Her more-than-laid-back presence (she always seems as if she just woke up) is an odd match against the frenetic but agreeable Gooding who shows much of his ""Jerry Maguire"" spark. Steve Harvey (of ""The Original Kings of Comedy"") is hilarious in a small role as the local radio announcer suspiciously eyeing his ever-present cigarettes as if something nasty has sprouted on them. But ""The Fighting Temptations"" exists for its rousing gospel soundtrack which is at times so good that you can forgive the movie its flaws. Like the upcoming ""The School of Rock"" the movie is ultimately about how music can bring people together -- an old tune but one worth hearing.

Starring Robert Duvall Michael Caine and Haley Joel Osment. Directed and written by Tim McCanlies. (PG. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""Secondhand Lions"" Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Garth and Hub ornery Texas bachelors who grudgingly accept temporary guardianship of Walter (Haley Joel Osment) their shy and sheepish 14-year-old grand-nephew. Theyre crazy old coots given to sitting on their porch sipping iced tea and taking aim at the traveling salesman who keeps sniffing around after hearing of their purported millions. Walter abandoned by his trampy flaky mom (Kyra Sedgwick) is spooked by the trigger-happy grumps but gradually warms to their idiosyncrasies and tales of adventure in the French Foreign Legion. Walter having discovered mementos of Duvalls onetime exotic romance wonders if the Legionnaire yarns arent faked. ""Just because something aint true dont mean you cant believe in it"" Duvall replies -- a twisted sentiment. Boosting the movies ""ahhh"" moments the wacky uncles also keep a menagerie of five inseparable dogs and one pig to which they add an aging mail-order lion (hence the title). Theyd just as soon shoot the ragged critter but Osment the movies bleeding heart begs them to spare the beast. McCanlies the screenwriter of the animated hit ""The Iron Giant"" makes a genial but disappointing directing debut with this coming-of-age schmaltz fest. Caine and Duvall are expert but the movie strains too hard for cockeyed whimsy and Osment too old for his part is less than convincing as a wide- eyed impressionable naif. Hes at the awkward stage beyond childhood but not ready for young romantic leads. Most child actors dont finesse the transition -- Jodie Foster and Drew Barrymore are exceptions -- and if Osment makes any more mistakes like ""Secondhand Lions"" he could join the sad ranks of former child stars. -- Edward Guthmann THE FIGHTING TEMPTATIONS Comedy with music. Starring Cuba Gooding Jr. Beyonce Knowles and the OJays. Directed by Jonathan Lynn. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) . ""The Fighting Temptations"" announces its priorities from the first scene with a gospel choir rocking the floor boards of a small church in rural Georgia. The music is glorious; the scene is exuberant and edging toward frenzy and everyone is exultant and moving in the spirit. ""The Fighting Temptations"" is all about such musical numbers and the rest of it is just a clothesline to hang them on. For the most part its a sturdy clothesline providing despite a few sags a warm comic story thats fairly engaging even when no one is singing. Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Darrin Hill a New York advertising executive whose life is foundering in lies petty fraud and unpaid debt. Partly to avoid his creditors he heads south to attend the funeral of a beloved aunt -- and then decides to stay when he finds out theres something in it for him His aunts will stipulates that if he leads the church choir in a regional competition he will inherit stock worth 150000. Like the similarly named Harold Hill in ""The Music Man"" Darrin is a softhearted faker who inspires a small town to dream. But his usual pattern of taking the money and running becomes less attractive to him once he meets the woman of his dreams right there in rural Georgia. Beyonce Knowles plays a single mom who also does a sultry singing act in the towns hot spot. Knowles is the main musical attraction of the film -- she sings ""Fever"" as though she were Rita Hayworth in ""Gilda"" putting the blame on Mame plus a number of traditional gospel tunes. The OJays also appear as townspeople who join the choir and gospel legends such as Shirley Caesar and the Blind Boys of Alabama playing themselves also perform. Gooding doesnt sing but his buoyant energy is in keeping with the music and his comedic skill is considerable. Hes ably supported in the New York scenes by Dakin Matthews who plays Darrins boss with impeccable comic timing. - This film contains a couple of mild sexual situations. -- Mick LaSalle DEMONLOVER Thriller. Starring Chloe Sevigny Connie Nielsen and Gina Gershon. Directed by Olivier Assayas. (Not rated. 117 minutes. At the Lumiere) . A thriller in need of Sandra Bullock Ashley Judd or someone else to root for ""Demonlover"" is well-scripted well-acted and occasionally sexy but just isnt all that interesting. The film focuses on Diane (Connie Nielsen) who works for a huge French corporation called VolfGroup. We meet her during a plane trip where she orchestrates the drugging and mugging of a colleague so she can take over a big account. It soon becomes apparent that Diane isnt what she seems -- nobody is in ""Demonlover"" -- and the next 110 minutes are spent following her life-or-death maneuvering with love interest Herve (Charles Berling) American businesswoman Elaine (Gina Gershon) and long-suffering assistant Elise (Chloe Sevigny). ""Demonlover"" aspires to be about sex murder Japanese animation and corporate game-playing -- with the women doing most of the double- and triple- crossing -- but the movie often fails to make sense. While the actors are game for wherever the plot takes them the audience is left wondering why this collection of characters is willing to lie rape and kill over the subject of VolfGroups big deal -- a few bad pornographic cartoons. As the film meanders gleefully to Internet torture Web sites and other forms of sexual brutality nobody seems shocked or concerned. Director and writer Olivier Assayas is skilled with handling actors and making a little money go far (the film manages to create the illusion that events take place in France the United States and Japan -- even though most of it appears to have been shot in empty hotel rooms). A pivotal dinnertime confrontation between Diane and Herve is particularly nuanced and the partially subtitled film shuffles between three languages (French Japanese and English) without breaking stride. What Assayas lacks is the ability to make the viewer care about his characters even as the movie takes some interesting turns. None of the main players in ""Demonlover"" seem to have families or lives outside of screwing one another over which makes it easier to feel indifferent about their fates. Maybe its a French thing but all of the leads in ""Demonlover"" seem clinically depressed. After a while theres nothing for the audience to do but feel the same way.- This film contains graphic sex scenes adult language and violence. -- Peter Hartlaub MAMBO ITALIANO Comedy. Starring Luke Kirby Peter Miller Paul Sorvino Ginette Reno. Directed by Emile Gaudreault. Written by Steve Galluccio and Gaudreault. (R. 88 minutes. At the Embarcadero.) . The mega hit ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" reopened the closet doors to broad ethnic humor. That film was subtle compared with ""Mambo Italiano"" a coming- out comedy that mines every cliche of cloistered Italian culture. But like ""Greek Wedding"" ""Mambo"" has enough funny moments to save it. Characters smack one another on the back of the head and yell ""basta"" as cloying string music keeps telling us ""These people are Italian."" The movie is set in Montreals Little Italy in the present but it could be the 1950s with Mama in flour-sack dresses young women in teased hair and tight clothes and parents smiting their foreheads because their grown sons want to move out of the house. The homosexuality of lead character Angelo (Luke Kirby) is supposed to modernize the picture but the gay plotline seems more like a device amid all the paisano antics. Anything ""other"" would have set off Angelos shrieking family -- at least his lover Nino (Peter Miller) is Italian. The gay element seems especially flat because the Angelo character is barely likable. First he outs his cop lover against his wishes then berates his parents (Paul Sorvino and Ginette Reno) for their small minds and constrained lives. Filmmaker Emile Gaudreault hasnt done enough to establish Angelo as a nice guy before the family crisis starts. The freshest moments come from the guys respective families trying to one- up each other even in their horror that their sons are gay. Angelos parents engage in a heated argument with Ninos mother about whos the dominant partner in the gay couple. Sorvino and Reno bring a lived-in bickering affection to their roles that offsets the caricatured elements. Gaudreault and co-writer Steve Galluccio pack the movie with jokes and about half of them are at least mildly funny. There are a few humdingers like a brief hilarious speech at the headquarters of a gay phone help line. Its also a nice conceit that Angelo a travel agent who dreams of being a TV writer pens scripts that are truly terrible. Kirby has a fresh-faced appeal that sees his character through his flaws and Millers enigmatic quality suits a guy who might not really be gay. But the leads are required to be tortured by their homosexuality and thus not very funny. Miller actually has more chemistry with sassy Sophie Lorain as an alpha female out to make Nino straight ""Give me an hour in the gay village and there wont be a gay village no more."" ""Mambo Italiano"" lacks any violence -- other than those smacks to the head - - and the sexuality is discreet so the R rating must have come from its gratuitous language. Characters say the f-word like theyre in ""Reservoir Dogs"" -- a curious choice for a quaint family comedy. - This film contains sexual situations raw language. - Carla Meyer SMALL VOICES Drama. Starring Alessandra de Rossi Dexter Doria Gina Alajar Amy Austria and Bryan Homecillo. Directed by Gil Portes. Written by Gil Portes Adolfo Alix Jr. and Senedy Que. (Not rated. 105 minutes. Tagalog with English subtitles. At the Lumiere Shattuck in Berkeley Metro Center in Colma and the Towne 3 in San Jose.) . Its too bad only one foreign film usually gets attention at the Academy Awards. Scores of countries submit entries every year -- and every year the submissions are pared down to a select winner (this year ""Nowhere in Africa"") while the rest are often left behind lucky to get any mention. Fortunately the Philippines 2003 entry ""Small Voices"" has been picked up for American distribution giving U.S. audiences a chance to check out this movie about a young idealistic teacher who works with children in a poor village. At times dramatic sweet funny and sentimental ""Small Voices"" almost seems like a fable -- except that its based on a real story and includes a subplot threaded with violence. Melinda Santiago (Alessandra de Rossi) faces stiff resistance from parents and fellow teachers when shortly after taking the job she tries to enter her class in a regional singing contest. Santiagos corrupt and cynical colleagues arent used to someone who questions school policies and uses resolve and creative measures (like selling ice candy to villagers) to support class projects. Although Santiagos students are excited about practicing for the vocal competition their parents say it needlessly cuts into their kids time for house chores and farming duties. One mother threatens to take her daughter out of class because ""youll (eventually) just marry and have kids."" ""Small Voices"" addresses issues that transcend Filipino culture and the setting and characters may even seem familiar to those who enjoy the work of Satyajit Ray and other directors who are considered humanist filmmakers. But Gil Portes -- a Philippine-born-and-raised director and screenwriter who now lives in New York -- includes many details that are unique including the guerrilla insurgency that draws in the father of two students. Perhaps the biggest blemish of this touching film are the white subtitles that are occasionally hard to read. - This film contains scenes of dead bodies. -- Jonathan Curiel IN THIS WORLD Drama. Starring Jamal Udin Torabi and Enayatullah. Directed by Michael Winterbottom. Written by Tony Grisoni. (R. 90 minutes. In Dari Farsi and other languages with English subtitles. At the Metreon.) . Theyre usually just nameless people cited in U.N. documents or newspaper briefs about human cargo. Whether its Chinese immigrants caught on ships bound for America or Turks and Iraqis found in big-rig containers heading for Europe these illegal immigrants keep risking their lives in search of a better home. With ""In This World"" director Michael Winterbottom puts an empathetic face on the problem dramatizing the plight of two Afghans who leave the squalor of Pakistan for the promise of London. Employing a technique more common to Iranian filmmakers than those in the West Winterbottom puts nonactors in the main roles. In fact the two Afghans who star in ""In This World"" are refugees whose lives mirror the ones they portray in this sensitive and illuminating work. Jamal Udin Torabi whose character is named Jamal and Enayatullah whose character is named Enayat (many Afghans have just one name) lived in Pakistan when they were tabbed by Winterbottoms crew. Their lack of English and affectation give the film its realism and so does Winterbottoms sweeping camera work which shows the two Afghans going overland from Peshawar Pakistan (on the border with Afghanistan) to Irans capital Tehran to the mountains of Turkey and onward. The footage of peaks and open-road terrain is stunning. Make no mistake though While Jamal and Enayat succeed in embarking on an epic journey (thanks to paying off human traffickers) they are forced along the way to spends days in shabby pathetic ""hotel"" rooms. Their time hiding in the backs of fruit and animal trucks isnt any better. Everywhere they go authorities seem to be nearby. In short Jamal and Enayat go through hell to leave conditions that are also hellish. Winterbottoms last film the jaunty funny ""24 Hour Party People"" was about Manchesters musical heyday. Where that movie showcased fame sex excess and narcissism ""In This World"" profiles conditions that many Westerners would rather ignore. Winterbottom is a credit to his profession -- someone who doesnt fit easy categorization and someone who lets his conscience dictate his projects. By humanizing an immigrant/refugee crisis that is not abating Winterbottom does a cinematic service that happens to be damn interesting too. - This film contains a scene of an animal killing. -- Jonathan Curiel CET AMOUR-LA French romance. Starring Jeanne Moreau and Aymeric Demarigny. Directed by Josee Dayan. Written by Josee Dayan. (Not rated. 98 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Lumiere.) . Harold and Maude play it straight in this French -- very French -- take on an autumn/spring relationship. Legendary French actress Jeanne Moreau whom Orson Welles once called simply ""the greatest actress in the world"" is onscreen for virtually every second of this take on the end of the life of prolific writer Marguerite Duras. Moreau now 75 can still command the camera. At times she glares into the lens and dares you to suggest that she cant play the romantic lead. Hey you tell her the rest of us are too intimidated. But her moonstruck lover Yann (Aymeric Demarigny) seems equally overpowered by the Moreau steamroller. Some of it is the role she is playing. As shown here Duras is a bossy obstinate mercurial diva whose social graces werent improved by alcoholism. She is given to statements like ""I am incredibly talented. That is a fact."" The idea is that Yann is so awed by her gift that he is willing to overlook everything the difference in their ages her moods and fits and the loss of any sense of his own life just to be with her. But as Yann Demarigny looks like Harry Potters older brother and acts like a lovesick puppy. Since he and Moreau are pretty much the entire cast he doesnt give the Duras character much to play against. As the film drags on and Duras health begins to fail their relationship seems more unlikely than ever. It seems inconceivable that this young man would put his life on hold to spend every waking moment with this jealous possessive combative old woman. Except of course that it is a true story. Yann Andrea a college student became so infatuated with Duras then 65 that he wrote her as many as five letters a day for five years. When they met he moved in with her ministered to her demons and helped to coax one last great book ""The Lover"" from her. And then when she died Andrea found he had learned the writing craft from her. He wrote the novel on which this movie is based. It is a great story but it hasnt been translated to the screen. It is never a good sign when the biographical notes have more emotional wallop than the movie. - Adult themes and drinking. -- C.W.

(Related item See a clip from The Fighting Temptations) The Fighting Temptations Think Sister Act 3 without the nuns. AP Instead think Sister Act3 without the nuns but with bubbly Beyonce Knowles in their place. Then add Cuba Gooding Jr.s mugging reactions to some of the years unfunniest dialogue. How does a movie like this get made? By MTV thats how. With a story that goes on forever yet cant find cast-stranded Rue McClanahan any words to say itcastsGooding asa New York ad-agency employee in scenes broader than any insipid 50s Madison Avenue sitcom who schemes to inherit 150000 from his late Aunt Sally. But theres a catch This schemer must first lead a small-town choir to top prize in a splashy gospel competition that in one of the movies few nods to restraint spares us Ed McMahon as host. More about the movie The Fighting Temptations  1/2 Stars Cuba Gooding Jr. Beyonce Knowles Mike Epps Steve Harvey LaTanya Richardson Director Jonathan Lynn Distributor Paramount Rating Rated PG-13 for some sexual referencesOpens today nationwide So here we are in Montecarlo Ga. needing some singers. Fortunately Knowles is the local nightspot chanteuse though you immediately sense that the locals including a tiresomely pushy biddy (LaTanya Richardson) arent going to let this babe reprise her opening rendition of Fever in church. Other motley recruits include McClanahan and a few cons Gooding amp; Co. meet during a gig behind bars. At this point we hold our breaths hoping for a screen treat millions have coveted for years a Rue McClanahan prison pic. But no. Its back to church and practice-session living rooms and also back to New York. This is one of those movies in which the hero is in severe financial straits with canceled credit cards yet still manages to fly back and forth from Manhattan to podunk on short notice even though thats when the airlines really gouge you. Its up to Knowles and the music to save the movie but the production numbers dont quite have the kinetic snap of their raucous equivalents in the climax of Sister Act 2. Worse the story drones on in the manner that director Jonathan Lynns worst movies (Greedy Sgt. Bilko) often do. Even when Lynn helped Marisa Tomei win an Oscar for My Cousin Vinny it took him 119 minutes four fewer than here. As for Gooding he tries hard and doesnt he always? Temptations plays like a test case on whether there can be life after Boat Trip a movie perched to pop up from the deeps at years end to dominate 10-worst lists. If Gooding cant get another Boyz N the Hood or Jerry Maguire soon his career will need its own cork.

Its even more rare to find a musical that successfully blends sincerity with showmanship. And its extraordinarily rare to find a movie starring Cuba Gooding Jr. he of ""Snow Dogs"" and ""Boat Trip"" infamy thats actually good. And that makes The Fighting Temptations a small miracle. Full-throated and good-hearted yet tart and sharp in all the right places this Ramp;B/gospel-fueled fairy tale (exuberantly directed by Jonathan Lynn from a nimble script by Elizabeth Hunter and Saladin K. Patterson) can be forgiven its many contrivances for the same reason that Velma Kelly could credibly stage a dance number in a womens prison Nobody cares as long as toes are tapping. Goodings characteristically hyperactive histrionics actually take on a kind of refinement here as he plays a Gatsby-esque New York adman named Darrin Fox whos just been fired for fabricating his resume Far from being a Yale man raised in Monte Carlo Fox is a high school dropout raised in nightclubs by his mother an Ramp;B warbler who was kicked out of the Montecarlo Ga. Baptist choir for singing the devils music. Now a beneficent aunts death - and her dying wish that the prodigal Fox lead the choir - draws the fast-talking player back to Montecarlo where predictably theres both a musical contest and a ladys heart to be won (the latter belonging to frequent showstopper Beyonce Knowles). But the movie is really an ensemble piece Mike Epps Steve Harvey Rev. Shirley Caesar rapper T-Bone and others turn in a rat-a-tat variety show of heights-hitting performances. ""Temptations"" makes shameless use of tried-and-true elements - but its hardly the same old song. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.
