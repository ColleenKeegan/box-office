Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Movies Red Dawn Chris Hemsworth Helms Lackluster Remake Without his Thor power this Red Dawn remake--which originally starred Patrick Swayze--would likely go straight to video By Mary Pols MaryPolsNov. 21 2012 Share Read Later Film District Distribution Red Dawn Year 2012 Director Dan Bradley Studio FilmDistrict Actors Chris Hemsworth Isabel Lucas Josh Hutcherson Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The jingoistic Red Dawn in which North Korea invades America in the very near future is the unfortunate movie Chris Hemsworth signed up for when he was still an unknown and maybe living if not under a rock perhaps in a pickup truck. Its a remake of the cult favorite 1984 Cold War-era action flick Red Dawn which featured Patrick Swayze as a Colorado kid who rallies a youthful militia after the red menace of the Soviet Union invades America. Both movies play like hokey advertisements for the National Rifle Association injected with high school pep rally enthusiasm. But while the 1984 version now seems as cutely misguided as leg warmers how to approach the embarrassing politics of the remake? Take Red Dawn as comedy although members of the international relations community--or for that matter people who pay good money to see it--might find that a tall order. The able Hemsworth plays Jed Eckert an emotionally bruised veteran on a visit home to Spokane after a few tours in the Middle East. His little brother Matt (Josh Peck) is the quarterback of his high school football team. After a prologue of talking heads giving a political ""primer"" on declining relations with North Korea the film opens with Jed and the boys dad (Brett Cullen) watching in dismay as the Wolverines lose their game. Its Friday Night Lights territory but without good writing or acting. (READ Why the decision was made to change Red Dawns villains from Chinese to North Korean) The brothers Eckert wake the very next day to the sound of bombs and the sight of North Korean paratroopers or their computer-generated facsimiles floating down from the sky all over Spokane--in an uncannily ordered fashion as if the sky were a grid they were adhering too. Spokane is soon under foreign control as well as other American cities although the crafty North Koreans cut off communication so its hard to know for sure exactly who is licking Kim Jong-uns boots. The boys escape to their familys hunting cabin with a crew of friends and acquaintances including a pair of younger handily tech-savvy geeks played by Josh Hutcherson (of The Hunger Games) and Conor Cruise (of the famous father).Weirdly--what a missed opportunity--there is no Korean-American character in the group who might have gone behind enemy lines and made the story feel more modern. Under Jeds tutelage they emerge as the Wolverines teenaged ninjas raising hell for those dopey invaders who bumble and stumble and can do little more than raise a frustrated fist at the kids. Only one of them their leader Captain Lo (Will Yun Lee) even gets a name. Adrianne Palicki Isabel Lucas and Alyssa Diaz provide the girl power all of which is very PG; no bunker hook-ups for these kids. If the movie finds an audience that audience will likely be 14 and oblivious to the fact that there ever was an earlier Red Dawn. Taking over the role Charlie Sheen had in the original Peck projects such pained sensitivity that I had doubts about Matts ability to make a sandwich let alone kill dozens of Koreans. But all of the implausibilities particularly that of these kids turning themselves into Hunger Games-style survivalists and bomb-building warriors is ignored so defiantly that it kind of works as it did back in 1984. (READ Richard Corliss on the late Patrick Swayze and his work in the original Red Dawn) Heres the awesome thing I learned about Red Dawn while trying to find out how the guy who starred in Thor and in this years mega-hit The Avengers got roped into a movie so bad its almost good even during production Hemsworth and the rest of the cast did not know who the enemy was only that they were Asian. In a mark of extraordinary dedication to the concept of villainy over petty narrative details MGM wavered between making the invaders Chinese or North Korean until the last minute. (Maybe thats why the Wolverines dont include a Korean-American character.) If Mitt Romney had been elected director Dan Bradley making his directorial debut probably had another talking head montage ready to go that would have swapped Romney for President Obama and those nefarious Chinese currency manipulators for the North Koreans. Maybe Bradley a veteran stunt coordinator was too focused on the stunts (there are many many of these and they feel very old school) to pull the trigger on who the  principal bad guys were going to be. By the end of the story both the Chinese and Russians have joined in the tyranny. As for the Hemsworth backstory it turns out he got the offer for Red Dawn on a Friday while on the set of Drew Goddard and Joss Whedons The Cabin in the Woods. What young actor with an uncertain future is going to turn down a remake of a Patrick Swayze movie that did well at the box office even before Dirty Dancing? (Trivia alert Jennifer Grey was in the original Red Dawn as well.) Of course he said yes. The very next day he got his offer for Thor. Maybe Hemsworth wishes hed lost his phone on that fateful Friday and found it only in time for the Thor call Saturday. But if it werent for him surely the Red Dawn remake would have gone straight to video; hes the only person worth watching in it (oh the pain of watching the wan Isabel Lucas hoist a rocket launcher). And maybe every young actor relishes the chance to rally the troops with lines like these ""We inherited our freedom. Now it is time for us to fight for it.""

"Red Dawn | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; red-dawn ) Red Dawn (United States 2012) November 21 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli John Milius 1984 action/adventure film Red Dawn has long faded from the memories of all but a small group of intense devotees. It is perhaps best remembered to the extent that its remembered at all as the answer to a number of trivia questions. It was the first film to be released with a PG-13 rating. It brought together Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey three years before Dirty Dancing. And it represented the acting debut of Charlie Sheen. Red Dawn wasnt a very good movie but it capitalized on the atmosphere of fear that accompanied the Reagan Cold War era spinning a credible yarn of how North America could fall prey to a combined Cuban/Soviet invasion. The central story a comic book yarn perhaps inspired by World War 2 stories about the French resistance was less interesting than the political/military backstory but it worked as forgettable disposable entertainment. Why someone thought this was a good candidate for a remake is anyones guess especially considering that the Cold War is two decades in the rearview mirror and fading fast. With the Soviets no longer a viable adversary the new screenplay decides to make the North Koreans the chief bad guys. Presumably this is because a more credible threat the Chinese are too important to be demonized in a project such as this. Attempts are made in a prologue to explain the ridiculous situation by which the North Koreans invade the United States but it never makes much sense. Today Americans are worried about Middle Eastern terrorists Iran and China. North Korea is far down the list of enemies. But thats the trouble with finding a good adversary in todays world. The United States is vulnerable to a number of things but invasion isnt a big concern. For roughly the first 2/3rds the 2012 Red Dawn follows the general template established by its predecessor. The final 20 minutes deviates substantially probably in an attempt to rectify structural issues obvious in the 1984 version. Unfortunately the changes dont work and make the movie seem more like the pilot episode of a weekly television series than a self-contained motion picture. John Milius at least provided some form of closure even if it was half-assed. The same cannot be said here - Red Dawn concludes on an upbeat note but is open-ended. The action takes place in and around Spokane Washington. On a Saturday morning marine Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) and his cocky younger brother Matt (Josh Peck) awaken to the sights and sounds of thousands of paratroopers dropping from the sky. Immediately recognizing this to be an invasion the brothers head for a mountain cabin accompanied by some other local kids Robert (Josh Hutcherson) Toni (Adrianne Palicki) Daryl (Connor Cruise) and Danny (Edwin Hodge). Out in the wilderness they become ""The Wolverines"" (named after the local high school football team) and execute guerilla attacks on the occupation forces led by a North Korean captain (Will Yun Lee). After a few successes the invaders begin to regard The Wolverines less as nuisances and more as a legitimate threat and take actions to eliminate them. The best segments of the film occur early as the setting is established with a dose of Friday Night Lights normalcy followed by an invasion that recalls Independence Day. Theres something viscerally effective about the sight of all those planes and parachutes clogging the early morning sky in Suburbia U.S.A. From that point however its all downhill. Constricted by the running time theres no time for development of any kind. Cue the pyrotechnics. Red Dawn suffers from a number of serious problems. The first and most obvious is that this is mini-series material compressed into a 95-minute movie. Its like seeing a few brushstrokes of a very large canvas. Of course the intention is not to tell a serious story of geopolitical upheaval and disaster but the films popcorn elements are underwhelming especially considering that first-time director Dan Bradley frequently misplaces his tripod whenever theres an action sequence. Yes Bradley adopts the depressingly commonplace approach of shaking the camera so badly during fights and chases that its impossible to figure out whats happening. Not much in the way of character development occurs. Chris Hemsworth plays the strong silent type in much the same way Patrick Swayze did 28 years ago. As a marine on leave from Iraq he knows war and has a good grasp of how a small troop of insurgents can create problems for a much stronger military machine. Josh Peck overdoes Matts whiny selfishness to the point where the character is unendurable. Hes about as dislikeable as Twilights Bella and for much the same reason for him its all about ""me."" Adrianne Palickis character (a re-working of the one played by Jennifer Grey) might have been more interesting if she had more to do than pursue a long-simmering crush on Jed. Everyone else stays in the background - a sure indication that most of them are about to be red-shirted. In 1984 Red Dawn felt relevant. Yes it was cheesy but kids could relate to the story. The ""better dead than red"" years were past as were the ""duck and cover"" drills but there was still a strong sense that the world was on a precipice and a Soviet attack could be imminent. The world is a much different place in 2012 and Red Dawns underlying scenario feels like it was ripped from a video game rather than the headlines. The movie is inconsequential forgettable and seemingly destined to get lost in the blizzard of late November releases pouring into U.S. theaters.

It so happens that the meanies in this videogame-lite remake of John Milius Reaganite 1984 gonzo classic are North Korean. (They were originally supposed to be Chinese but the producers got nervous at the last minute about offending the planets rising superpower.) The aggressors could have easily been Indonesian or Cambodian or any foreigners really for all that politics matter in this fantasy of young people going rogue and fighting for their right to party American-style. (They call themselves the Wolverines after their high school football team. BOO-yah.) Under the direction of longtime stunt coordinator Dan Bradley (The Bourne Ultimatum) the cast looks pretty while playing with guns -- but nothing more. Thors Chris Hemsworth leads the pack as a high school football star-turned-Marine while Josh Peck plays his stubborn younger brother. Theres also a collection of junior guerrillas including The Hunger Games Josh Hutcherson and Friday Night Lights Adrianne Palicki.

But rather than offend a lucrative film market some post-production editing and CGI tweaking was done to change the military logos. In the process the filmmakers have altered the premise from the unlikely to the ridiculous. Film Red Dawn 2012 official trailer The closing minutes of a high-school football game in Spokane Wash. introduce us to the main players. Impetuous home-team quarterback Matt (Josh Peck) is watched by his strong-and-silent policeman dad (Brett Cullen) and manly big brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth) a recently returned Iraq war vet. Later that night theres a mysterious power outage at a local bar. In the morning the brothers wake to a sky filled with North Korean airplanes and paratroopers.Jed and Matt and a few local teenagers escape to a nearby cabin in the woods where Jed quickly trains them into a guerrilla fighting force. Well-armed after a series of daring raids on the North Korean occupiers they become an insurgency group named the Wolverines after their football team.Twenty minutes in Red Dawn evolves into a series of shaky-cam raids and manically edited firefights (""Dude were living Call of Duty and it sucks"" complains one of the kids). The gruff Hemsworth (who had not yet starred in Thor and The Avengers when this was shot) is a competent tough guy snapping out orders and glowering when needed. Most of the other characters come across as disposable horror-movie teen extras particularly the female cuties-in-distress (Adrianne Palicki and Isabel Lucas). The North Korean invaders are anonymous except for the sadistic Captain Lo (Will Yun Lee).While catering to the uncomplicated pleasures of righteous butt-kicking the updated script also allows room for some ironies about how circumstances can change perspective. In Iraq Jed explains ""We were the good guys.... Here were the bad guys.""Some uncomfortable doubts remain about who exactly ""they"" and ""we"" are supposed to be. Late in the film a trio of former Marines bolster the Wolverines including an Asian-American vet (Kenneth Choi). His blatantly token presence cant erase suspicion that Red Dawn panders to the worst kind of racist and jingoist impulses though the movie is so preposterously insincere it feels like those adjectives should be in air quotes.

Comments (24) click to enlarge Red Dawn Video Rated PG-13  93 minutes  2012 John Miliuss 1984 cult classic about American teens battling a Soviet invasion has been reinvented as a Tea Party wet dream that offers a scathing (if completely illogical) indictment of the federal government. When the western seaboard is invaded by the North Korean army the president fails to act so a pack of high schoolers in Washington State launch a rebel resistance to defend our liberty. As these young freedom fighters forge ahead courageously exercising their Second Amendment rights screenwriters Carl Ellsworth and Jeremy Passmore merge action movie heroics with ass-backwards politics blunting the genre pleasures that made the original so delightfully kitsch.

In the early going of Red Dawn - the unnecessary un-fun remake of John Milius 1984 Russians-invade-America cult fave - hundreds of CG-rendered North Korean paratroopers descend on Spokane ready to kill any Americans who get in the way. Shot more than three years ago and only now making its way to the multiplexes Red Dawn is a movie with a red state state of mind. (The invaders were originally Chinese but with three years to consider geopolitical trends the filmmakers wisely changed the bad guys to a nation that doesnt own a giant U.S. theatrical exhibition chain.) A TV news montage of the world going kablooey - Europe in crisis cyberhackers shutting down power grids Asian conflagrations and Middle East attacks and Obama and Biden and Hillary Clinton trying to calm a nations frayed nerves - lets us know that things are not going swimmingly. And then Kim Jong-uns army arrives. Luckily a bunch of defiant Washington teens jump in a pickup truck crash through some barricades and make for a cabin in the woods where they plot a guerrilla campaign against Capt. Cho (a villainous Will Yun Lee) and his tanks and armored vehicles. Well-stocked with guns and ammo and armed with a good nickname - the Wolverines after the school football team - the boys make sorties into town to blow up occupied buildings and generally make a patriotic nusiance of themselves. The resistance fighters are led by Iraq veteran Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth pre-Thor) and his smug kid brother Matt (Josh Peck) the star quarterback. Theres a techie guy (Josh Hutcherson) the mayors son (Connor Cruise) a cheerleader (Isabel Lucas) and the girl (Adrianne Palicki) with a crush on Jed. After a while three ex-Marines show up too. Milius Red Dawn starred Patrick Swayze Charlie Sheen Lea Thompson and Jennifer Grey (and grizzled character actors Ben Johnson and Harry Dean Stanton) and had a goofy far-fetched empowered-youth macho appeal. The Red Dawn reboot directed by Dan Bradley a stunt coordinator and second-unit director (action action action) is hobbled by a laughably bad script and a uniformly uncharismatic cast. Peck for one wouldnt be convincing if he was filmed sitting on a couch working his Call of Duty game controls. Contact Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Red Dawn review Big yawn | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRed Dawn review Big yawnRed Dawn a remake of a 1984 film of the same name offers a cautionary lesson in movie remakes.Connor Cruise and Josh Hutcherson in the forgettable remake Red Dawn.  (Mark Preston / Alliance Films)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterWed. Nov. 21 2012Red Dawn(out of 4)Starring Chris Hemsworth Isabel Lucas Josh Hutcherson Josh Peck and Connor Cruise. Directed by Dan Bradley. 93 minutes. Opens Nov. 21 at major theatres. PGSomeday hopefully soon a film school somewhere will create a course called Remakes Why Bother?Topping the list of ill-conceived retreads ought to be Red Dawn a remake of the 1984 film of the same name. Article Continued BelowThe original did a reasonable job of entertaining audiences and kick-starting the budding careers of its young stars among them Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen.This version has had a more checkered history shot in 2009 scheduled for release in November 2010 then put on the shelf due to the financial woes of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer until now.In the interim its young stars faces have become recognizable which may help explain the studios decision to finally release this sorry remake. The careers of Chris Hemsworth (Thor The Avengers) and Josh Hutcherson (The Hunger Games and the upcoming sequel Catching Fire) arent exactly needy of Red Dawns added exposure. And its unlikely this remake will inject any stardust into the trajectories of the remainder of this barely memorable cast.Its really that bad starting with the premise which in the original was risible -- an invasion of the U.S. by the Soviet Union. By 1984 then-president Ronald Reagan had taken to calling the U.S.S.R. the ""evil empire"" so the premise was at least conceivable to the ultra-paranoid patriot set.This time around its nasty North Koreans parachuting into Spokane Wash. North Koreans? Really? Oh yeah theres also some stern Russian ""advisers"" along for the ride.The opening pseudo news clip setup -- the European debt crisis a new North Korean leader U.S. troops stationed abroad leaving ""American shores unprotected"" -- is beyond ludicrous.But it gets worse because the film helmed by first-time director Dan Bradley -- whos had a lengthy career as stuntman and assistant director -- is just really really lame right down to the Communist symbols that adorn the revised Stars and Stripes.While its entirely believable -- given Americans devotion to the right to bear arms -- that a small band of teens dubbed the Wolverines and led by Jed Ekert (Hemsworth) a Marine home on leave could arm themselves to the teeth and carry on a guerrilla war against the invaders the rest is undiluted dreck.""Even the tiniest flea can drive a big dog crazy"" is a sample of the homespun wisdom (and deplorably bad dialogue) to which the audience is subjected.Theres some ho-hum sibling rivalry between Jed and younger brother Matt (Josh Peck) who stubbornly insists on rescuing his girlfriend Erica (Isabel Lucas) who is virtually a blond cipher. Hutcherson for one has no character development to speak of and like Connor Cruise (adopted son of Tom) almost no dialogue. Ostensible villain Captain Lo (played by Will Yun Lee) is about as menacing as a surly parking lot attendant.With forgettable characters and dismal dialogue and plotting even action fans are going to find the new Red Dawn a major yawn.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Movie review New geography but same old Red Dawn - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate New geography but same old Red Dawn Share Tweet Share Tweet By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent | 11.21.12 | 1253 AM Youd think that post-9/11 Americans have if anything greater worry about threats from abroad than we did back in 1984 when the teen Commie-anxiety flick ""Red Dawn"" was released. So you can see where the producers of the new remake told themselves that the built-in receptiveness factor was there. They even planned on hitching their movie to that dated title -- making this in a way an even odder war story than the bluntly provocative Reagan-era original. As the target demographic emeritus will recall the old setup had down-home Colorado youths Patrick Swayze Charlie Sheen C. Thomas Howell and pals turning mountain guerrilla fighters (""Wolverines"") when Soviet forces invade. The new version from stunt coordinator-turned-director Dan Bradley drops Chris Hemsworth Josh Peck and Josh Hutcherson into the roles and shifts things to more urban Spokane (actually Michigan). While the filmmakers might employ other geopolitical hot spots to most effectively tap contemporary fears North Korea is promoted to Evil Empire status. Semi-forced? Maybe. But hey it satisfies the brand. And the creative choice is no more suspect than 11th-hour re-edits and digital tweaks reportedly used to swap out China as the invader to avoid a negative impact on Hollywoods growing Chinese market. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters As a combat action spectacle the movie takes a straightforward gritty approach that makes for mostly solid viewing. The opening surprise attack in particular is immersively jarring. (Hard to figure what happened with a climactic office-building shootout an editing mishmash thats comprehensible only in a general way.) Hemsworth is given an Iraq-vet background that makes the groups survivalist reinvention a somewhat smaller leap. And the writers work to give the characters issues -- tensions heartaches impossible dilemmas -- that could plausibly boil over under fire. Hemsworth and Peck (""Drake amp; Josh"") are distractingly miscast as borderline-estranged brothers but peripheral story conflicts are an upgrade from some of the ""After School Special"" drama we remember. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The filmmakers nominal handling of political commentary is another matter. Unable to decide whether to play it retro-jingoistic or contempo-liberal they split the difference. (At least the movies fuzzy convictions didnt date anything while studio bankruptcy wrangling kept the finished product on the shelf for a couple of years.) At one moment the script has a globally empathetic undercurrent with Hemsworths character sharing his views on insurgency ""To them this is just some place. When youre fighting in your own backyard . . . it all makes a little more sense."" At another moment the stance is government-issue. Says Hemsworth ""When I was overseas we were the good guys. We enforced order."" What penetrates is when Hutcherson in ""Hunger Games"" reluctant-combatant mode observes ""Dude were living Call of Duty and it sucks."" Not a poetic sentiment maybe but a pointedly relevant one. If ""Red Dawn"" flashed more of this there might have been more reason to dust off its Cold War tale.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The original 1984 action staple Red Dawn may be a dumb reactionary fantasy born of lingering anti-Soviet paranoia and Second Amendment zealotry but there can be no doubt that its vision of Americans fighting the Reds on their home soil comes straight from John Milius ball sack. Starting with the genuinely spooky image of Soviet paratroopers cascading onto an open field behind a Spokane high school Milius film thoroughly imagines an American city transformed by invasion and occupation which raises the stakes for the plucky young guerrilla warriors who lead a rebellion from the mountains. The remake of Red Dawn has no such conviction lamely substituting North Korea the flavor-of-the-month rogue nation for the U.S.S.R. while focusing mainly on reproducing the action without letting ideology get in the way. But Red Dawn without the jingoism is like a pie without the filling--it collapses into splintered mush. Director Dan Bradley a respected stunt coordinator and second-unit director making his debut feature opts to scrap the memorable opening to Milius film in favor of an enemy drop right onto suburban streets and lawns. Taking over for Patrick Swayze Thors Chris Hemsworth plays the leader of a band of rebels a shit-kicking Iraq War veteran who knows how to survive in the woods and use guerrilla tactics against a much larger force. Joining him is his little brother Josh Peck a high-school quarterback who lacks confidence and fights uphill to earn his older siblings respect. Together with Josh Hutcherson Adrianne Palicki Isabel Lucas and Conner Cruise they form ""The Wolverines"" a scrappy band of rebels who take the schools mascot as a rallying cry. Jeffrey Dean Morgan shows up later as the leader of active-duty Marines who provide vital support in the shouting-dumb-slogans department. Mired in postproduction for a few years--during which time the bad guys were changed from China to North Korea for marketing reasons--Red Dawn makes a few half-hearted bids for political relevance but it seems distinctly uncomfortable with pushing buttons. The films real agenda rests with supplying scads of bloodless semi-coherent action with clear good guys and bad guys and a little All-American can-do spirit behind it. White hats fighting for the homestead offer a basic Western appeal but Red Dawn is a generic time-passer at best--and no matter where a person might stand on Milius original that descriptive would never apply.

Is it possible North Koreans would invade Spokane by parachute even as Russia was colonizing the Eastern Seaboard? Well sure in the same way aliens might descend on New York City and superheroes would unite to protect us. But the latter feels like an entertaining way to purge some real anxieties while the former comes across as a cheap attempt to cash in without expending any extra effort. Granted Cold War fears were real in 1984 when the original ""Red Dawn"" was made. But in Dan Bradleys clunky remake they seem misplaced and out of touch. Ironically the movie itself is a perfect example of contemporary globalization. The film was shot in 2009 featuring Chinese villains before producers realized theyd be alienating a huge international audience. So the film was altered in postproduction turning the enemies into North Koreans. ""Avengers"" star Chris Hemsworth plays Jed Eckert an Iraq War vet whos barely returned home when Spokane is attacked. His dad (Brett Cullen) sends Jed and brother Matt (Josh Peck) to the family cabin where they regroup with some friends (played by ""Hunger Games"" co-star Josh Hutcherson Adrianne Palicki Isabel Lucas and Connor Cruise (Toms son). Somehow this straggling band of teens has to outwit the militia of Captain Cho (Will Yun Lee) and reclaim America. The more ludicrous a concept the more crucial it is that the director embrace the bigger-than-life absurdity. But everything about this project feels small-time. Generic characters spout empty dialogue enact poorly shot video-game-style violence and leave no impression whatsoever. The original at least had a cast that included Patrick Swayze Harry Dean Stanton Charlie Sheen and Jennifer Grey. In this group only Hemsworth stands out. Fortunately hes already moved on to Marvels ""Thor"" franchise undoubtedly a far more sensible and realistic adventure.

Only one thing is more improbable than that plot the idea that someone thought ""Now is the time for a remake."" Starring Chris Hemsworth Josh Peck Josh Hutcherson Director Dan Bradley Running time 134 Release Opened Nov 21 2012  Editorial Review Remake has more boom still lacks popBy Michael OSullivanWednesday November 21 2012Theres good news and bad news about ""Red Dawn"" a remake of the 1984 action film about high school kids from the American heartland forced to become guerrilla warriors when their small town is invaded by foreign troops. Im happy to report that the amped-up retread which substitutes North Korean soldiers for the original Soviet bad guys -- and a steely Chris Hemsworth for a cheesy Patrick Swayze -- is a big improvement. The bad news is Thats not saying much. Unlike some who hold dear the memory of the 1984 film I watched the thing not all that long ago when a collectors-edition DVD came out in 2007. It hadnt aged well and in the shifting light of 21st-century geopolitics the old films rabid anti-communism seemed slightly silly as did the fake-looking gunplay and explosions. The world changes and so do our standards for things that go boom. The new ""Red Dawn"" starts off pretty scary as the Pacific Northwest town where its set wakes up to find its spacious skies suddenly filled with menacing aircraft and paratroopers. The scenes that follow -- featuring internment camps and summary executions -- will be red meat for tea party patriots. Like the conservative documentary ""2016 Obamas America"" ""Red Dawn"" hints broadly that the United States has left itself open to attack and occupation through a combination of weak foreign policy and squandered military might. Thats going to be a tough pill to swallow for some. Others will eat it up along with all the speechifying about how freedom isnt free. Much of that speechifying initially comes from Hemsworths Jed a brooding Marine who finds his home leave (and brooding time) rudely interrupted by the invasion. This unexpectedly leaves him in charge of his younger brother Matty (Josh Peck) and several of Mattys teenage friends after they manage to slip through the clutches of the brutal North Korean prefect (Will Yun Lee) who has been assigned to suppress the locals. Jed quickly recruits the kids to the cause of resistance and the rest of the film is spent showing their training and tactics as they evolve into a crack squad of freedom fighters. Its moderately good fun even if it comes with a heaping helping of baloney on the side. Why exactly has the enemy decided to occupy this particular sleepy backwater? Its never terribly clear. Theres a suggestion that strategically there may be more going on here for the North Koreans than meets the eye but the film never delivers on that promise. The far-fetched nature of the military occupation is more than a little hard to overlook. And a mawkish subplot about the sibling rivalry between the disciplined Jed and his impulsive little brother -- neither of whom looks like he could possibly be related to the other -- feels trite and unsupported. It just adds mushiness to the story when what it needs is more snap. ""Red Dawn"" briefly picks up when a cadre of retired soldiers (led by Jeffrey Dean Morgan) joins the adolescent fighters who have come to call themselves ""Wolverines"" after the mascot of the local high schools football team. Where the youngsters seem at times more interested in making out with each other than they are in making a difference the older men bring a refreshing get-er-done attitude to the battle reminding us of whats at stake (or at least whats supposed to be at stake). Theres a glibness and superficiality to the proceedings that never allows us to care very deeply about anything or anyone. Ultimately the problem with this ""Red Dawn"" is the same problem with the first one. Despite the more realistic battle scenes nothing in it feels more fateful than a football game. Contains obscenity gunplay and violence.

After paratroopers rain down the NorKs win over lefty sympathizers with an Occupy Wall Street-like platform of blaming ""corporate corruption"" but a large portion of the country remains unconquered Were told that from ""Michigan to Montana Alabama to Arizona"" the American way lives on. That sounds like a right-wing fantasy to break off the coasts like crusts of bread. Yet I can hear bicoastal types murmuring ""Wait we can unload those yokels in the fly-over states in exchange for Communist rule? Win-win"" The 1984 ""Red Dawn"" was mediocre but at least it was warmed by the nutty energy of its writer-director John Milius who seemed alarmingly intrigued by the second half of the injunction ""Beat the Russians or die trying."" This time North Koreans take Spokane. ""North Koreans? It doesnt make any sense"" someone says speaking for all the head-scratchers in the audience. It makes perfect sense if you consider that the Chinese were originally scripted as the villains but nobody wants to mess with them anymore not even in a movie. Fleeing the NorKs and launching a guerrilla movement are Marine Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth of ""Thor"") who is back from a tour in Iraq and his little brother Matt (Josh Peck) a high school football star. They and Matts girl (Isabel Lucas) a geek (Josh Hutcherson) the mayors son (Connor Cruise) and Jeds former camping buddy Toni (Adrianne Palicki) set up a base camp in the woods from which they launch unpredictable attacks. Whenever they win a skirmish they scream their bloodcurdling cry ""Mighty Ducks"" Er I mean ""Wolverines"" The remake reuses highlights from the first film but the two new screenwriters big ideas for freshening up the material are woeful. Remember when the lads kill a deer and make the youngest drink a cup of its blood? This time the kid calls it a ""blood latte."" When stuck living in the woods they say they miss playing ""Call of Duty."" ""Dude were living Call of Duty and it sucks"" says another guy. A problem with the movie is that you cant picture anyone involved in it bothering to do any more research into guerrilla warfare than was available from the nearest Xbox. The director a rookie named Dan Bradley did the action scenes in the ""Bourne"" movies but here the firefights are clumsily edited unexciting routine. When for instance the Wolverines disrupt a public execution with an ambush from the rooftops you cant tell how they pulled off the raid. All we know is a bunch of shots are fired and when its over our guys are the ones still standing. Bradley cant even find a fresh way to do a training montage. And those scenes are Bradley at his best; when it comes to emotional stuff like the romances between the two couples he is MIA. The dull predictable direction is the perfect match for a watery nondescript cast. Patrick Swayze wasnt much of a movie star but he might as well have been Marlon Brando compared to Chris Hemsworth.

RELATED NEWS Goody Original Red Dawn captures mood politics of 80s A look at the original Red Dawn cast By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Nov 20 2012 1033 AM At first you might think that if youre going to remake a movie shouldnt it be a good one? Then you think no if you remake one thats not so good you have a chance to make a better movie something thats probably unlikely if you remake a classic. You will think of these things as you watch ""Red Dawn"" director Dan Bradleys remake of John Milius 1984 action film about teenagers standing up to a foreign invasion. The one thing you wont think much about is ""Red Dawn"" because it isnt smart enough to lend itself to such rigorous pursuits. Oh you might contemplate how Chris Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson have managed to go on to bigger things despite making this which has sat on the shelf for a while now. Jed (Hemsworth) is the leader of a gang of kids whose lives change when North Koreans invade. Soon they and a handful of friends are hiding out in the woods where Jed a Marine on leave teaches them the finer points of making explosives and sniper skills to fight back. Could be fun you might think. No. Bad acting and worse dialogue quickly put an end to that notion. Unlike the original there is no Cold War to hang the story on so the idea of an invasion seems rather strained. Thus you might think why bother to remake the thing in the first place? You may think all of these things maybe more. Mostly I think it stinks. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

"Red Dawn remake wont win hearts and minds Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Red Dawn remake wont win hearts and mindsRed Dawn stars Chris Hemsworth Josh Hutcherson and Connor Cruise. It lacks the appeal of the original.November 20 2012|By Mark Olsen Los Angeles Times Josh Peck left Josh Hutcherson and Chris Hemsworth star in ""Red... (Ron Phillips Film District )A remake of the 1984 film of the same name the new ""Red Dawn"" arrives in theaters following years of delays involving bankruptcy and a switch of the films central villains from the Chinese to North Koreans. If the original with its premise of American teenagers fighting off a Russian invasion was something like ""The Outsiders Fight Back"" steeped in last-gasp Cold War anxiety this update never finds an equivalent relevance or hook failing to connect fully with our here and now.While a foreign regime exerting its emergent power over America certainly has a familiar ring to it if anything this new ""Red Dawn"" is a movie in search of its moment.North Korean forces supported by Russia a apparently safe again as go-to bad guys a have taken control of both coasts while a stretch of the country from Michigan to Montana Alabama to Arizona remains known as Free America. That those are mostly Red States seems not at all coincidental and it is even possible to imagine the film as being conceived somewhere along its prolonged gestation as a dramatization of the ""take America back"" rhetoric of the tea party in its ascendancy.THE ENVELOPE SCREENING SERIESA The Sessions |A Anna KareninaThe group of Washington state youngsters who hole up outside town to operate as an insurrectionist force known as the Wolverines (after their high school mascot) includes a pre-""Thor"" Chris Hemsworth a pre-""Hunger Games"" Josh Hutcherson and Hollywood offspring Connor Cruise.At one point two of our insurgents duck into a doorway to take cover from a firefight and realize they are in a Subway sandwich franchise open for business and full of customers. The moment is a shock to them and to the audience as the idea of life functioning with some semblance of normalcy under occupation isnt otherwise much grappled with. The kids stick the place up for food a ""No flatbread"" a and take off falling into their new roles as urban guerrillas.Dan Bradley a veteran second-unit director responsible for action sequences in such films as ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" makes his directing debut here and so its no surprise that a few brief car chases have a visceral crunch. Yet that doesnt explain how some of the bigger set pieces feel undersold and rushed as if instead of making them centerpieces Bradley was still thinking someone else would add to them later on.Seemingly unwilling to fully embrace any position be it jingoistic patriotism anti-corporate anger or revolutionary radicalism the film winds up timid and unfocused. Reasonably dopey fun on its own the remade ""Red Dawn"" simply cant stand up to the real-world issues it steps on like a land mine.mark.olsenlatimes.com--Red DawnMPAA ratingA PG-13 for sequences of intense war violence and action and for languageRunning timeA 1 hour 33 minutesPlayingA In wide release PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO A guide to upcoming movies The Envelope Awards Insider PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-red-dawn-20121121,0,1603905.story",200,reddawn(2012)15,reddawn(2012),latimes

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 606 p.m. EST November 20 2012A remake of a movie made at the end of the Cold War Red Dawn is a war-mongering flag-waving spectacle. Josh Hutcherson and Chris Hemsworth give the only memorable performances.Josh Peck left Josh Hutcherson and Chris Hemsworth star in the reboot of the cult classic Red Dawn.(Photo Ron Phillips Film District)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourStars Chris Hemsworth Josh Hutcherson Josh Peck Jeffrey Dean Morgan Isabel Lucas Connor CruiseRated PG-13; runtime 1 hour 33 minutes; opens Wednesday nationwideYet another unnecessary reboot hits theaters this week with a few good action sequences but marred by one-dimensional characters and excessively shaky camera work.Early in Red Dawn ( out of four; rated PG-13; opening Wednesday nationwide) residents of Spokane Wash. wake up to paratroopers floating in as if suspended on pale mushrooms. Soon the shooting strafing and explosions begin.As in the 1984 original the heroes are predominantly teenagers -- mostly members of a high school football team -- led in this superficially updated version by a soldier who had fought in the Iraq War.ALEXANDER Original Red Dawn casts light on future starsEXCLUSIVE DAWN CLIP Im Gonna Fight.The premise is that enemy forces -- North Koreans and Russians -- have invaded the USA without warning. It quickly becomes an all-out occupation. People are taken prisoner and most choose to fearfully cooperate. But not these feisty teenagers. Under the tutelage of Jed (Chris Hemsworth) the older brother of Matt (Josh Peck) who plays on the Wolverines football team they escape to the woods and learn to fight like the toughest Marines. Their training takes mere days. These teens are soon firing all manner of weapons setting up elaborate ambushes and detonating bombs as if they were seasoned combat veterans. But theres never any real depiction of how these kids are actually coping separated from family friends and any vestige of their former lives. Are they scared determined ambivalent? The movie doesnt bother to go there. Similarly collaborators choose their path with no explanation.Thor star Hemsworth is credible as the unofficial leader of the overnight soldiers convincing as an action hero and believable in his uber-patriotic speechifying. Peck as his brother is far less effective with an acting style that would be better suited to a remake of Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure.The fighters begin to resemble a rural militia dubbing themselves the Wolverines. Its essentially a shoot-em-up spectacle devoid of any moral complexity.Fire first and never ask questions seems to be their motto.The film features some taut action sequences well choreographed by director Dan Bradley who is also one of the top stunt coordinators in the industry. But scenes are rather murkily shot and characters are like cardboard cutouts.These young guerrillas eventually meet up with a trio of roving Marines. Oddly they are the only hint of national military forces around though their leader (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) speaks of swaths of unoccupied territory ""from Alabama to Arizona and Michigan to Montana."" Apparently the invading evildoers are scared off by alliteration.Only those with paranoid fantasies of an en masse invasion on American soil will find Red Dawn remotely powerful. The concept should have been updated to allow for more complex and surreptitious kinds of warfare.Any episode of Homeland is far more terrifying.Josh Peck Talks Red DawnSkip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Red Dawn star Josh Peck answers 5 Questions for Detroit Free Press reporter Julie Hinds.

Whats Going On? Credit Open Road Films Released during Ronald Reagans 1984 re-election campaign the original Red Dawn was denounced as right-wing propaganda. But while director and co-writer John Milius fantasy of Colorado high-school students who battle Soviet and Cuban invaders was anti-communist it was principally pro-gun and pro-youth. In spirit it was closer to Frank Capra than to Leni Riefenstahl. Neither of those names comes to mind when watching the clunky new Red Dawn -- which is not all that new. Filmed in 2009 the remake was shelved for several years. Then apparently someone noticed that it stars Chris Hemsworth who later played Thor in two superhero flicks that made a few bucks. Alas he doesnt impersonate the Norse god in this movie which might benefit from a thunderbolt of divine intervention. Narratively the revamped Red Dawn is much like the first one. The heroes are still mostly teenagers although they now live in Spokane. And they still call themselves ""Wolverines"" after the local high school team. But the villains have been updated which may be the funniest thing about this inadvertently comic misfire. When the movie was shot the invaders were Chinese. But as the pixels aged in some digital cellar the producers had second thoughts. China is a growing market for film production and distribution. So they did reshoots and CGI fixes and turned the marauding hordes into North Koreans. Yes soldiers from North Korea a country whose electrical grid is frail whose food production is disastrous and whose missiles tend not to travel far from their launchpads. A country whose likelihood of conquering Spokane is about as high as say Yemens. Nonetheless the movie shows a sky full of North Korean paratroopers who land just after the football team loses a squeaker. Luckily Jed (Hemsworth) is in town on leave from the Marines. He assembles an adolescent guerrilla force that includes younger brother Matt (Josh Peck) -- the quarterback whose team just folded so hes got something to prove. i The ragtag group of teens call themselves the Wolverines after their high schools mascot. Ron Phillips/Open Road Films hide caption toggle caption Ron Phillips/Open Road Films The ragtag group of teens call themselves the Wolverines after their high schools mascot. Ron Phillips/Open Road Films Also in the ranks are a tech guy (Josh Hutcherson) a woman with a crush on Jed (Adrianne Palicki) and the son of the citys turncoat mayor (Conner Cruise son of Tom). Matts blond-cheerleader girlfriend (Isabel Lucas) is already in commie custody but the Wolverines will soon rescue her. The kids enemies are mostly nameless their threat condensed into one figure Capt. Cho (Korean-American actor Will Yun Lee). Hes a Ming the Merciless type whos fond of summary executions preferably witnessed by the victims family. Perhaps inspired by U.S. troops battles in Iraqi cities director Dan Bradley often abandons the hilltops for urban combat. But Spokane isnt exactly Baghdad and its hard to believe that the Wolverines could strike with impunity and then blend into the teeming crowds. No medium-sized American city teems. Bradley has experience as a stunt coordinator which might have heralded credible battle sequences; as a director however he conforms to the current vogue for fast pans handheld camera and frenzied edits. That makes large chunks of the movie energetic but incoherent. The pace slows for the deaths of named characters but the rest of the action could just as easily be break-dancing as combat. The new Red Dawns body count is as high as its predecessors. But the fatalism in all of Milius projects -- even the silliest ones -- has weight. Thats not the case with the remake whose portrayal of violence derives more from video games than from history. It wouldnt really matter if the movie were doctored once again to replace the Koreans with Klingons.

Good thing too because this is a movie that requires a caffeinated audience. The 1984 edition of ""Red Dawn"" played upon Cold War-era paranoia about the Soviet Union with whom wed never engaged on the battlefield even though they were our national Big Bad. That film imagined a Russian invasion of Colorado with high-school jocks going commando and becoming freedom fighters. Its a little strange to be seeing a new ""Red Dawn"" now that the Cold War is over and theres very real conflict in the world that all too many American teenagers are being sent to fight. What was once jingoistic wishful thinking and kind of dopey wishful thinking is now a mere adolescent power fantasy with the ""Call of Duty"" generation suddenly firing off real rocket launchers and automatic weapons. If this were any more about a childish desire to shoot at bad guys our heroes would ""br-r-r-r-oh"" The remake stars Chris Hemsworth (""The Avengers"") and Josh Peck (""The Wackness"") as Spokane Wash. brothers who flee to the woods and adopt guerilla tactics when North Korean soldiers start parachuting into their sleepy hamlet. Jed (Hemsworth) between tours of duty overseas finds himself having to whip a bunch of fresh-faced kids into fighting machines while Matt (Peck) proves reluctant to take orders. (The movie lets us know this by opening with a football game in which QB Matt refuses to pass the ball despite repeated entreaties from his coach.) Before you know it theyve created a ragtag bunch of rebels including nerdy Robert (Josh Hutcherson) hot chick Toni (Adrianne Palicki) and the-other-one Daryl (Connor Cruise giving a blank performance in a blank role). Matts girlfriend Erica (Isabel Lucas) eventually turns up looking like the most refreshed refugee camp escapee of all time. (As she related her tale of horror I half expected her to weep ""And then ... they ... spray-tanned me"") There are some other Wolverines (the teen fighters adopt their highschool mascot for their anti-invasion terror cell) but first-timer Dan Bradleys direction of Carl Ellsworth and Jeremy Passmores choppy script makes it a challenge to figure out whos who and what happens to them. For instance Julie (Alyssa Diaz) seems just to disappear at one point although presumably the character dies in one of the many incomprehensibly edited action sequences. Say what you will about director John Milius and co-writer Kevin Reynolds work on the original movie those guys knew how to blow stuff up while allowing the audience to follow along. During much of the new ""Red Dawn"" whenever shots were fired or explosives were set off I lost track of who was running in which direction for what reason. The lead actors here have all done fine work in other movies but this material is so flimsy that they are powerless against it. Hutcherson gives what may be his first lackluster performance here and I say that as someone who saw both ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" movies. ""Red Dawn"" has followed a somewhat tortured path to the big screen The invading troops were originally Chinese but the uniforms and flags were later digitally switched to North Korea so as not to offend one of the worlds largest growing film markets. After that studio bankruptcy led to the film spending years on the shelf next to another Hemsworth vehicle the far superior ""Cabin in the Woods."" Let us learn a lesson then if not from the scrappy underdogs of ""Red Dawn"" but from the journey of the film itself Sometimes even when the cards are stacked against you and it looks like things wont work out you can overcome all the obstacles only to discover in the final analysis that your movie still sucks.

The mild violence barely hid a pendulum swinging away from lefty Hollywoods post-Vietnam hand-wringing toward a hysteria in sync with Reagans ""evil empire."" Todays wholly unnecessary remake has in turn these same two elements as distinguishing features Machine-gun fire sprayed by insurgent teens defending Washington State from parachuting foreigners has a Saving Private Ryan ping to it--the sound of bloodless action made for semi-grown-up kids. And the horde of North Koreans (changed from the Chinese during this films lengthy postproduction) plays to axis-of-evil anxieties effective in a pretitle sequence in which clips of Obama Biden and Hillary Clinton make the case for eastward vigilance. But a new Red Dawn could have been so much more fun had it thrown a properly out-of-bounds tea party. (It lacks the signature brawn of original director John Milius a guns-first libertarian.) This updates cast led by Chris Hemsworth as an Iraq vet in a tentative performance captured before Thor and The Avengers has roughly the same bland nonappeal as the originals Patrick Swayze and pals. The script would have benefitted from more shameless wing-nuttery as when a black mayor (no relation to any real-life political figure) preaches appeasement. Instead we get too much running around the woods yelling ""Wolverines"" Even todays 13-year-old is too sophisticated for that.

Starring Chris Hemsworth Adrianne Palicki and Josh Peck. Directed by Dan Bradley. (PG-13. 105 minutes.) The most striking thing about ""Red Dawn"" is not that its dumb but that its unnecessary. And irrelevant. And makes no sense for 2012. The movie is a remake of the 1984 film of the same name which imagined a ground attack on the mainland United States by the Soviet Union with average Americans rising up to beat them back. The premise was fantastic even at the time but it came out of the eras very real Cold War tensions of a world with two superpowers competing head to head. People felt paranoid and ""Red Dawn"" spoke to that paranoia. Twenty-eight years later there is no Soviet Union so who might attack the United States and gain an immediate foothold on both coasts? Really who should we be worried about? The answer North Korea. Thats right in the new ""Red Dawn"" North Korea finally makes its move and almost knocks us out with one blow. Scary huh? Feel the chill? Its a funny thing. The rest of the world thinks of the United States as tough and borderline invincible but Americans always feel just a little uneasy a little vulnerable. Yet I doubt even the biggest geopolitical nervous wreck has spent much time worrying that North Korea might start landing ground troops in Spokane Wash. And even the depiction of precisely that in ""Red Dawn"" - plus aerial bombing - wont make that a popular nightmare.

Photo Open Road Films Red Dawn review Attack of the implausible 1 / 4 Back to Gallery So ""Red Dawn"" has its own absurdity to contend with. Then it has to contend with everything else. Chris Hemsworth - when is this actor going to catch a break? - plays a Marine on leave back home in Spokane who turns out to be a good man to have around in a crisis. One morning the North Koreans arrive and start blowing up the neighborhood and curiously no one reacts as one might expect. Yes they seem distressed but no one is shocked. No one says ""Why are the Koreans blowing up the neighborhood?"" Rather they act as if they were sort of expecting it but hoping it wouldnt happen. The Marine with the help of a young lady (Adrianne Palicki) who would be his lover if only the Koreans would stop shooting long enough for them to take their clothes off forms a guerrilla band of warriors. In no time the guerrillas have machine guns. Then they have explosives lots of them though how they acquire them is never quite accounted for. It should be said that ""Red Dawn"" is not repellent and sometimes isnt boring. Any sequence in which Americans are trying to blow up say a building full of invading politicians and generals has a certain built-in rooting interest as well as a story interest Will the bomb go off? Unfortunately the characters are so programmatic the premise so ridiculous and the situations so far-fetched even if you accept that premise that no energy can be built and the little thats there cant be sustained. ""Red Dawn"" is a vigorous but pointless exercise. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Red Dawn movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Homeland insecurity in Red Dawn  With North Koreans standing in for the Russians remake lacks overheated passions of the first DawnNovember 20 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie critic (Handout photo)For a while there the invading army in the ""Red Dawn"" remake was Chinese. Then the producers decided to change the enemy into North Koreans backed by a Russian or two for old times sake by way of an opening sequence explaining the geopolitical and economic crises that have rendered America ripe for attack. We see among others Vice President Joe Biden mouthing words of warning while implicitly standing for the United States of Appeasement. Elsewhere in the remake the emblems on the tanks and such have been digitally de-Chinesed so as to ensure better box-office results in the lucrative Chinese market. And to blazes with North Korea.The film itself shot in 2009 by director Dan Bradley is more of a damp matchstick than a blaze. It stars Chris Hemsworth in the old Patrick Swayze role and a couple of Joshes Hutcherson and Peck. Like the first and more interestingly insane ""Red Dawn"" a product of the Reagan era and the fevered machismo of writer-director John Milius the remake imagines a home-turf takeover this time in and around Spokane Wash.Americas only hope is a gaggle of high school kids who form a guerrilla army calling itself the Wolverines after the local high school football mascot. ""We inherited our freedom"" says Hemsworths U.S. Marine and Iraq War veteran a less emotional and vulnerable fellow than Swayze gave us. ""Now its up to us to fight for it.""Revisiting Milius ""Red Dawn"" its astonishing just how many hundreds of people die on screen in what was the first release to enter the marketplace with the newly created PG-13 rating in 1984. The mood swings in the original are fascinating as well with Milius ""Lord of the Flies"" infighting jostling for attention with weird little dollops of humor (a shot of the captured town reveals the local movie theater to be playing ""Alexander Nevsky""). The new ""Red Dawn"" is a more buttoned-down affair although its two-faced hypocrisy regarding the horrors of war are just as galling as they were a generation ago. Hemsworths character delivers speeches to his younger comrades about the ugliness and bloodiness of whats about to happen but of course theres no movie without the thrill of the righteous kill. And since the North Koreans have employed cyber-terrorism and old-fashioned airstrikes and ground troops to make the U.S. its playground its 100 percent righteous killing.I like Hemsworth as an actor and Hutcherson as well; they know how to serve a scene (even a stupid one) and keep things self-effacing. Peck from TVs unfortunate ""Drake amp; Josh"" and the indie ""The Wackness"" not so much. Hes all adenoidal mumbling and too-cool-for-the-invasion self-regard. Many of the original films booby-trap scenarios are repeated here but without Milius grandiosity and nihilism. Theres less of both in the new ""Red Dawn."" Its not a disaster.

Photo Credit Film District advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT When North Korea invades America a group of teenagers defend its tiny hometown. BOTTOM LINE Fans of the hard-hitting original may fume over this lightweight remake though others may tolerate it as a mindless action flick. CAST Chris Hemsworth Josh Hutcherson Josh Peck Isabel Lucas LENGTH 133 During the Cold War summer of 1984 John Milius ""Red Dawn"" spun a Commie-invasion scenario about three small-town youngsters -- played by up-and-comers Patrick Swayze Charlie Sheen and C. Thomas Howell -- who lead a guerrilla rebellion against the pinko trifecta of Russian Cuban and Nicaraguan aggressors. It was wildly implausible and more than a little jingoistic but also tough-minded troubling even bitter. For all its flaws ""Red Dawn"" was a movie with the courage of its convictions. The remake arriving at a time when Americans fear sleeper cells more than superpowers feels like a movie without a cause. It initially portrayed the invaders as Chinese (still Communist you know) until someone realized that might alienate one of the worlds biggest overseas movie markets. The villains were then re-edited into North Koreans (who are presumably too isolated to object).

Recast with contemporary hotties Chris Hemsworth (""Thor"") Josh Hutcherson (""The Hunger Games"") and Josh Peck -- all quite serviceable -- ""Red Dawn"" starts out strong with a panicky car chase and some rough violence. Adrianne Palicki and Isabel Lucas provide some love interest (a welcome improvement to the undersexed original) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan is appealing as Tanner a grizzled Marine who discovers that the famous rebels called the Wolverines are just a bunch of kids. Although ably directed by first-timer Dan Bradley ""Red Dawn"" consistently goes soft where the original stood firm. Its villains are dehumanized Asians (Will Yun Lee glowers inscrutably as Captain Cho) and its teen heroes make only brave choices never tough ones. Worse it invents a silly MacGuffin -- a North Korean wonder-box of some sort -- that our Wolverines try to steal. As empty entertainment the movie is almost passable. But whats the point of a brighter lighter ""Red Dawn""?

Red Dawn Teens thwart North Koreans in remake of Red Dawn By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com314-340-8344 Joe Williams Nov 20 2012 (...) FilmDistrict From left Chris Hemsworth Adrianne Palicki Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Connor Cruise in ""Red Dawn."" FilmDistrict Josh Hutcherson and Adrianne Palicki in ""Red Dawn."" Complaining that ""Red Dawn"" is a cheaply made ineptly directed and laughably acted remake of a movie that wasnt very good to begin with is like complaining about the overcast weather at a concentration camp. Youre missing the big picture.Like the 1984 version ""Red Dawn"" is a warning. Foreign terrorists are coming for our cheerleaders. Maybe not today maybe not tomorrow but soon and for the rest of your life. So are you going to run away like a little weasel or fight like a wolverine?In the Reagan-era original the heroes were freedom-fighting kids in Calumet Colo. and the invaders were Russians. In the recession-era remake the heroes are freedom-fighting kids in Spokane Wash. and the invaders are North Koreans. Yet the villains were supposed to be Chinese until our economic overlords forced the producers to make a last-minute change. Can you read the writing on the wall Mandrake? While Spokane slumbers the wily communists cross 5000 miles of ocean and parachute into suburbia (without a peep from the pacifists in Seattle apparently). The North Koreans quickly seize control. But they didnt factor a fighting machine like Jed Eckert (Chris ""Thor"" Hemsworth).Jed is an Iraq War veteran and the son of a cop so hes able to drive and shoot his way through the invasion like a superhero stopping just long enough to toss some provisions and teenagers (including Josh ""Hunger Games"" Hutcherson and Connor ""Son of Tom"" Cruise) into the back of the pickup. But the most volatile cargo is temperamental little brother Matt (Josh Peck) who resents Jed for abandoning the family after their mother died and insists on sneaking away from the woodland guerrilla camp to free his girlfriend (Isabel Lucas) in the city. The horror of a foreign invasion is so unimaginable that director Dan Bradley barely tries to imagine it. But the sight of armed Koreans herding turncoat Americans into food distribution centers beneath posters denouncing corporate corruption is enough to make a job creator cry.Like Paul Revere the pack of patriots who call themselves the Wolverines are sending us a message This world is divided between the makers and the takers and after just a few minutes of ""Red Dawn"" youll realize theres not much more you can take.What ""Red Dawn""  One and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 140  Content Sequences of intense war action and violence and some strong language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

""Red Dawn"" pitted Americans against Communists. A reboot casts the enemy as North Korea -- and its absurd Hugh Ryan Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics China cinema Cold War Communism fear-mongering Film Hollywood Movies North Korea Reagan Red Dawn Russia science fiction Entertainment News Politics News Chris Hemsworth in ""Red Dawn"" If I told you I was making a movie about a small group of child soldiers who use IEDs and scavenged weapons to fight a guerrilla war against a larger occupying force what would you picture? The war-torn sands of Gaza? The refugee camps of Somalia? The mountains of Afghanistan?How about the small towns of rural Colorado? Thats the setting for ""Red Dawn"" the 1984 piece of militia porn that pitted a group of American kids against the combined might of the invading armies of Cuba Nicaragua and the USSR. Led by Patrick Swayze they lived off the land and harvested what seemed to be a never-ending supply of rocket-propelled grenades with which they blew up tanks and Soviet-American Friendship Centers.The film was released in the height of the Cold War and its ludicrous premise (best summed up as ""Hey kids lets go fight an insurrection"") fit well with the rest of the decades fear-mongering anti-Soviet propaganda and jingoistic paeans to American exceptionalism. Lets not forget that this was the same year that Reagan joked ""My fellow Americans Im pleased to tell you today that Ive signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.""""Red Dawn"" might not have been a great movie but it fit within the context of its time -- a time so far gone as to be almost unrecognizable to Americans today. If you were born the year the Soviet Union collapsed you would now be 21. Even Mitt Romney no longer thinks Russia is our No. 1 geopolitical foe. As a nation weve seen firsthand the damage IEDs (and a desperate civilian population) can inflict. Instead of one Cold War there are now dozens of hot zones and areas of civil unrest. At a distance of 28 years ""Red Dawn"" seems to sit at the intersection of anachronistic naive and offensive.Which raises the question Why would MGM release a remake? As John Milius director and co-writer of the original said to the Los Angeles Times in 2010 ""Its a stupid thing to do.""The new ""Red Dawn"" which hits theaters on Wednesday is directed by Dan Bradley and stars Chris Hemsworth Adrianne Palicki and Josh Hutcherson. Filming actually wrapped in 2009 but its release was delayed for over a year due to MGMs financial restructuring. In 2011 ""Red Dawn"" was put off yet again when leaked footage of its Chinese villains caused an uproar in state-run Chinese newspapers. MGM terrified of losing access to Chinas booming entertainment markets quickly announced plans to scrub the villains and replace them with someone we can all agree to hate North Korea. This do-over tacked on another million to the projects overall 60 million budget as well as another year to its production schedule which is how it came to be this years Thanksgiving box-office turkey.Its an admirable amount of sacrifice for a company to make in order to prevent global hostility. In fact the only better alternative would have been to pull the movie entirely. Instead of worrying about how ""Red Dawn"" might play in Asian markets perhaps MGM should start considering how the message of the movie might play in the Middle East North Africa or even here in America.To be clear to release a movie today that celebrates the moral right -- nay responsibility -- of well-scrubbed American children to kill invaders is like giving a giant middle finger to the people around the world who see us as the invading army and whose children have died by the thousands already. ""Red Dawn"" is a ghoulish parody of reality served up earnestly and obliviously to an audience whose enjoyment will perforce be directly proportional to its ignorance. You Might Also Like But thats not the only way this remake dangerously subverts real-world politics. This new ""Red Dawn"" encourages an idea of America-in-danger that is absolutely ludicrous. Bioterrorism dirty bombs black market nukes -- all of these are real national security threats that would make for interesting movie plots. But an invasion by North Korea a country that cant even feed its own population without international aid goes beyond lazy writing. It feels as though the authors have consciously abandoned reality because any intrusion of the real world would lay bare the fact that this movie is about young children fighting and dying in their hometowns a horrible fate thats happening to real children in real towns all around the world every day.Now is the time for a deft and subtle hand to write layered intricate movies about the realities of insurgent fighting nation collapse and life under a foreign army. Now is the time to celebrate heroes like Malala Yousafzai for resisting violence and demanding her rights as a human being. Now is not the time for poorly written calls to violence that use the realities of global conflict as window dressing for a testosterone-fueled orgy of violence and retribution (but if thats what youre looking for the 2016 Republican primaries will start in about three months).I was 6 when the original ""Red Dawn"" came out. After watching the movie my older brother and I made our own camouflage by charring wine corks and rubbing them on our faces. We snuck out at night and hid in the eaves of our roof to pitch pennies at invading raccoons intent on stealing our all-American trash. I had a hiding hole full of throwing stars nunchucks and other odds and ends ordered from the back of comic books or purchased at dubious truck stops during family vacations. Did ""Red Dawn"" make me violent? No. Years of being socialized to be a boy had already done that. But it did affect my understanding of violence. It made righteous retribution seem glorious sexy patriotic and fun. It made me feel like I (and my entire country) could be the target of an unprovoked all-out assault at any moment -- a pre-victim if you will whose own violent behavior would be excused by circumstance. In other words ""Red Dawn"" simplified global conflict down to something a 6-year-old could well understand You took my stuff so now Im going to hit you until you give it back. Is this the message we want to send to the world today? I sincerely hope not.One scene from the original movie has stuck with me my whole life (well two if you count the opening where the kid gets shot in the head during history class). In it Powers Boothe plays Lt. Col. Andy Tanner an Air Force pilot shot down in Occupied America who joins the ragtag resistance group. When asked why the invasion happened he opines ""Maybe somebody just forgot what it was like"" to be at war.The new ""Red Dawn"" asks all of us to forget what we know about the world at war today. This is a path that leads in only one direction toward ever-escalating conflict. Theres an old military adage that says that an army is always still fighting its last war. Do we really need to be fighting the ones from 30 years ago? Hugh Ryan is a freelance journalist and YA author based in New York City.

Rather than accept this as good fortune the absence of this test of mettle has been a source of insecurity in some quarters so weve enacted our Stalingrads on the battlefield of the screen.Red Scare trash Invasion U.S.A. (1952) lent its title to an 85 Chuck Norris actioner itself riding the popularity of John Miliuss 1984 Red Dawn. (And does anyone remember the Kris Kristofferson miniseries Amerika?) The best of the lot Miliuss Red Dawn imagined a Soviet-Cuban allegiance linking up in Rocky Mountain Colorado where they meet opposition from high-schoolers-turned-partisans a savage bracing film drawing heavily on wartime Brit-invasion fantasy Went the Day Well? (1942).Now it has been remade as all films perforce must be 2012s Red Dawn begins in Spokane Washington as the clock winds down on the quintessentially American pastime of Friday-night high school football. Hothead quarterback for the home-team Wolverines Matt Eckert (Josh Peck) loses a squeaker in front of his girlfriend Erica (Isabel Lucas) his sheriff dad (Brett Cullen) and his big brother Jed (Chris Hemsworth). Hanging at the margins of town life prone to plopping down at the dining room table with a sixer just for himself Jed is an ex-Marine gone a little slack without high-pressure warfare to keep him taut and motivated.Film Details Red Dawn RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time93 min. More Info Trailer Jed doesnt have to wait long for a new mission. The following morning the sky is dotted with countless parachutes and Spokane has succumbed to a sneak attack by the dastardly . . . North Koreans? Picking up a few stragglers along the way Matt and Jed head for the hills loaded for bear. Once apprised of the developing situation--an officer called Captain Cho (Will Yun Lee) is now ""acting prefect of this district"" resistance is futile etc.--the escaped form up their own resistance. Theyre called the Wolverines and they model themselves per Jed on ""the Vietcong mujahideen even the minutemen"" with the de facto commander drilling his accidental recruits into a home-grown run-and-gun guerrilla insurgency.Single-mindedly action-oriented to the point where Miliuss film seems relatively ruminative this Red Dawn is handled by promoted stunt coordinator Dan Bradley who when the original came out was already making a living going headfirst through glass. Here Bradleys highest accomplishment is Matt and Jeds initial escape through the invaders tightening roadblocks a sequence that rides on snap-decision adrenal instinct with Matt off-roading the familys Dodge Ram around backyard pools the disjointed dashed-off design of the scene fitting the total disorientation of the experience. But even after Jed has drilled the Wolverines to ""keep [their] shit together in a firefight"" and theyve been battle-tested and born again hard Bradley sticks to the same ""film the hell out of everything and hope it all shakes out in the editing booth"" approach. What should be Red Dawns centerpiece--the Wolverines tactical assault with the backup of some out-of-retirement Marines on a police station that the occupying forces have converted into their headquarters--is scarcely more legible than the first panicked moments of takeover.Milius a well-read student of military history filmed his maneuvers with clarity took every pain to make his invasion seem practically feasible and applied the same care to the human details of his story--the relationships of brothers and sisters in arms the attrition on both sides of a war. Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheens Eckert brothers were half-wild country boys in over their heads who only knew how to shoot straight and audiences responded because they knew kids like them. Hemsworth is an alpha recruitment poster strong and silent until the script demands he deliver patriotic pregame pep talks; Pecks the Selfish Youth who needs to learn ""theres no I in team""--both stock characters with nary an atom of individual truth to them.It is possible that Bradley feels obliged to keep up the blitz on the audience to keep us from focusing on the manifold improbabilities here. How could North Korea a malnourished ingrown nation of 25 million hope to enforce martial law on the vast densely forested and well-armed Pacific Northwest? Didnt the filmmakers see Team America World Police? What high school quarterback would be wearing a Dinosaur Jr. shirt in 2012?Or perhaps I should say 2009 which is when Red Dawn was actually filmed--and who knows how many uncredited interventions led to its final form. As for the unconvincing casting of North Korea its no surprise to learn that they are a hasty post-production substitution for the Chinese who in the movie as initially scripted and shot had come to collect on the U.S.s massive overdue debt like a billion loan sharks on a feeding frenzy. This might have added a sorely missing topicality to this otherwise wholly egregious production but the occupying army of businessmen who run the movies depend on overseas box office like America depends on foreign oil and gone are the days when we could cheerily offend one half of the world for the entertainment of the other. Very soon it seems Hollywood will have perfected the art of making movies that batter no ones sensibilities except that tiny minority who have a shred of dramatic or aesthetic discrimination themselves a veritable North Korea in their isolation--though there might be more of us than they think.

The film -- a remake of the 1984 actioner about a Soviet invasion of America -- had originally updated its villains to the Chinese. The new idea was that tired of waiting for us to pay back all those loans Bejing would forcibly repossess our whole country. It was actually a rare fresh take on an old plot. Except then the Chinese heard about the movie and started ranting about it in their government-run press. And so a craven Hollywood quickly changed the villains to North Koreans badly redubbing the Mandarin dialogue and digitally altering all the onscreen flags and banners. Because we wouldnt want to offend a big country full of potential consumers would we? Say what you will about the popcorn original -- written and directed by wild man John Milius -- but at least it had the courage of its macho/libertarian convictions. Anti-authoritarian and pro-NRA it saw Americas salvation in a small gang of heartland high-school jocks. The remake though is just another action film. An out-of-date one too. Thanks to the financial difficulties of MGM this picture was shot three years ago which makes the casting look a little peculiar. Josh Hutcherson who plays a supporting role is now a star; Josh Peck who plays the lead no longer is. Peck -- considerably slimmed down since his old Nickelodeon days -- is the main character here though and not much fun to watch always stamping around and looking like hes about to bawl. (Also -- in what impossibly murky gene pool are Peck and Chris Hemsworth siblings?) After a hasty credits sequence that tries to set up the premise (and a badly shot football game that establishes Peck as an arrogant go-it-alone guy) we jump right into the CGI thick of things with hundreds of North Korean paratroopers landing in the Pacific Northwest. Most of the helpless American adults are quickly shot rounded up or turned into collaborators. But the hardy teens take to the hills where trained by home-on-leave soldier Hemsworth they rapidly transform into a tight band of guerilla fighters determined to strike back. The training sequence though is a little silly (one kid is assigned a SuperSoaker) and much of what follows is pretty improbable with these high-schoolers suddenly cool-headed demolition experts skilled at creating remote-controlled bombs. Of course any movie which has North Korea swiftly successfully invading the United States is clearly willing to strain credulity. Director Dan Bradley used to be a stunt person and he overstuffs the film with car crashes blurry hand-to-hand battles take-no-prisoners gunfights and lots of stuff blowing up. The movie never pauses -- at least not to waste time on anything like developing the female characters. But theres no edge to anything either dramatically or politically. And things get even softer when adult authority returns in a trio of Marines who quickly take charge of the rebels. Putting grown-ups in control only subverts the heady youth-power message of the whole movie; it sells out characters weve invested some time and trouble in. But then clearly this film knows all about selling out. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Red Dawn (PG-13) Film District (93 min.) Directed by Dan Bradley.

(AP Photo/Film District) <<1234>> In Theaters This Week Get showtimes watch movie trailers Opening Wednesday The Big Picture Life of Pi Life of Pi 3D Red Dawn Rise of the Guardians Rise of the Guardians 3D Interviews with the stars hot new trailers Remaking an old film is rarely a good idea but sometimes the idea is so spectacularly bad that the reasoning behind it defies all comprehension.Case in point ""Red Dawn"" which limps into theaters this holiday week almost three years after it was shot. (It has been sitting on a shelf since 2009 in part because of the financial problems of MGM the studio that made it.) The original was made in 1984 toward the end of the Cold War co-written and directed by John Milius an often terrific screenwriter (""Apocalypse Now"") but also a true believer in the Soviet menace. In the first ""Red Dawn"" Milius cooked up a jingoistic bit of paranoia that had the Soviet Union (with the help of Cuba) invading the United States. America of course fought back -- in the form of some Colorado teenagers turned resistance fighters.Even a quarter-century ago it was pretty silly stuff but at least it was diverting popcorn entertainment that didnt require (and really couldnt tolerate) too much deep thought. Over the years it drew something of a cult following because of a cast that included such actors as Patrick Swayze Jennifer Grey Lea Thompson and Charlie Sheen -- all of whom would go on to better things.Now comes the remake and what was silly fun is just plain dumb this time.Advertisement Obviously the Evil Empire of the Soviet Union isnt around any more so the filmmakers initially turned to the Chinese as the invaders -- which at least didnt take plausibility to the breaking point. But after the film was made studio executives decided the decision to make China the big bad wolf would hurt ticket sales in the lucrative Chinese market. So through digital magic all the Peoples Republic banners posters and insignia were wiped out and replaced by those of -- wait for this -- North Korea. Seriously? Making the invaders the Canadians would have more grounding in reality.Writers Jeremy Passmore and Carl Ellsworth working from the original script by Milius and Kevin Reynolds tried to keep something of a grip on reality by adding a lame premise giving the North Koreans a secret weapon that allows them to knock out Americas military forces. Then in ways that are never quite clear Pyongyang ships its military to the West Coast for the invasion.For whatever reasons Spokane Wash. seems to be a prime target and its there that the bad guys run into a band of suburban teenagers (called the Wolverines just as in the original) led by Jed Eckert a Marine on a leave from his unit played by Chris Hemsworth (Thor in ""The Avengers"") in the role originated by Swayze. Hemsworth -- a solid actor who has filmed ""The Avengers"" ""Thor"" and ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" since making this flick -- manages not to look embarrassed by lines like ""We inherited our freedom. Now its up to us to fight for it."" It may be his best acting job ever.Hemsworths Marine leads a resistance force that includes (of course) the towns star high school quarterback (the Disney Channels Josh Peck) a girl who has the hots for Jed (Adrianne Palicki of ""Friday Night Lights"") a geek (Josh Hutcherson of ""The Hunger Games"") the head cheerleader (Isabel Lucas) and the mayors son (that would be Connor Cruise Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidmans kid) who is appalled to find his father cooperating with the invaders.Jeffrey Dean Morgan a good character actor who presumably needed a paycheck at the time pops up as a veteran soldier who teams up with the Wolverines. And Will Yun Lee (the remake of ""Total Recall"") is stuck in the thankless role of the nasty but completely inept North Korean commander who lets his presumably battle-hardened troops get repeatedly ambushed by the young insurgents.If ""Red Dawn"" has one virtue its that director Dan Bradley (a veteran of stunt and second unit work) has a nice flair for battle scenes and some of the fight sequences are more exciting than they had any right to be. But even those moments are largely undermined by the shaky (literally) camera work of Mitchell Amundsen.About the only positive thing you can say about ""Red Dawn"" is that it is finally coming along on the perfect holiday Thanksgiving otherwise known as Turkey Day. Certainly this movie goes gobble gobble.For all things Oscar and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.red dawn  Rating PG-13 (for violence and language)Cast Chris Hemsworth Adrianne Palicki Josh Hutcherson and Josh PeckDirector Dan BradleyRunning time 1 hour 33 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Daily Edition Login to download Red Dawn Film Review 1242 PM PST 11/15/2012 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS An already silly premise is given a ham-fisted treatment in this ill-advised remake of John Milius 1984 hit action film. TWITTER Remake of John Milius 1984 cult favorite about a ragtag group of teen guerrillas fighting foreign invaders. The recent failure of North Korea to even launch a missile successfully lends a comic air of preposterousness to the already silly premise of Red Dawn the long-delayed remake of John Milius fondly remembered 1984 action film. Dan Bradleys reboot originally featured the Chinese as the villains but hey China is a lucrative film market while North Korea barely can keep its lights on hence the post-production switch. In any case this version is unlikely to strike a similar chord with young audiences while severely disappointing older fans of the original. It also contains far less resonance today than during the Cold War with domestic problems seeming far more a threat than foreign invasion. The premise once again concerns a stalwart group of teenagers who band together into a ragtag guerrilla army opposing the nasty North Koreans who suddenly besiege their hometown of Spokane Washington. Unintentionally echoing Mitt Romneys campaign pronouncement that Russia is our biggest international threat the film drops hints that they are also part of the conspiracy. PHOTOS Behind the Scenes of Marvels The Avengers The opening credits are accompanied by a montage of news clips featuring the likes of Obama Biden and Hillary Clinton warning about the threat of cyber-terrorism. It turns out that they were right as its eventually explained that this vicious sneak attack was precipitated by a total shutdown of our computer grids. The filmmakers dont waste any time beginning the action a mere fifteen minutes in with frightening scenes of tanks and paratroopers led by the bloodthirsty Captain Cho (Will Yun Lee) suddenly occupying the placid town. Dubbing themselves the ""Wolverines"" in honor of their high school football team the towns teens raised on a steady diet of war-themed videogames quickly take up arms to fight the invaders. Led by recently returned Iraq War vet Jed (Chris Hemsworth who filmed this before hitting the big time as Thor) they include star quarterback and Jeds kid brother Matt (Josh Peck); Toni (Adrianne Palicki) who carries a torch for Jed; tech geek Robert (Josh Hutcherson); head cheerleader Erica (Isabel Lucas); and Daryl (Connor Cruise) the mayors son. Theyre eventually joined by a trio of retired Marines led by a gung-ho type (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who utters such macho pronouncements as ""Its a good day to die gentlemen."" Thats but one example of the generally risible dialogue which includes Jeds observation that ""Even the tiniest flea can drive a big dog crazy."" Director Bradley is a former stunt coordinator which accounts for the well-staged action sequences that take up the bulk of the films relatively brief 93-minute running time. Unfortunately DP Mitchell Amundsen hewing to the now standard formula uses shaky hand-held cameras to photograph much of the proceedings resulting in near incoherent visuals that quickly induce monotony. Other than Hemsworth who infuses his character with a credible gravitas the young performers are wholly unconvincing in their roles with Palicki and Lucas somehow managing to look perfectly made-up and beautiful even while engaging in the down and dirty action. Morgan provides his usual strong screen presence and Korean-American actor Lee once dubbed one of People Magazines ""50 Most Beautiful People"" makes for a suitably hissable villain.

Despite the considerable impediment of a premise arguably even sillier than that of the original ""Red Dawn"" helmer Dan Bradleys long-delayed remake of John Milius 1984 kids-vs.-Commies adventure delivers enough thrilling action sequences and rock-em sock-em fantasy-fulfillment to amp its B.O. potential. Of course considering the near-deafening negative buzz generated during its extended post-production period the pic might elicit muted praise from critics as well as ticketbuyers simply for not living down to expectations. FilmDistrict plans a Nov. 21 release though its amusing to ponder its potential political and pop-cultural impact were it released before Election Day. Much like the 84 pic co-written by Milius and Kevin Reynolds (and duly credited as inspiration in the opening credits here) the remake depicts the heroic exploits of teen resistance fighters after their community is invaded by an occupying force. In this version of the story the community is Spokane Wash. not a Colorado hamlet and the invaders arent Cold War-era Soviet troops but ... well something else. For the benefit of those who tuned in late China was depicted as the aggressor when this ""Red Dawn"" was shot in 2009. But after MGM its original distributor declared bankruptcy the producers opted to make the pic more appealing to other distribs (particularly those wary of offending Chinese government officials) by refilming scenes relooping dialogue and digitally altering flags and military insignia to transform the bad guys into war-mongering North Koreans. Even so it should be noted that the pic sporadically indicates that somehow Russians also are involved in the invasion. Judging by whats shown and said here however China isnt merely a non-issue; it doesnt exist. Despite the change -- or to be more precise changes -- to the nationality of the occupying army its still the same old story a fight for love and glory a case of do-or-die as outgunned and outnumbered partisans take their best shots during an urban guerrilla campaign against the enemy. Led by the slightly older Jed Eckert (Chris Hemsworth) a newly returned Iraq War veteran the teen commandos commandeer the name Wolverines from their high-school football team -- a plot point considerably more significant in the original -- and repeatedly return to Spokane from their woodland camp to carry out sabotage and assassination missions. The young warriors -- including Matt (Josh Peck) Jeds impetuous younger brother; Toni (Adrianne Palicki) a tough fighter whos conspicuously sweet on Jed; and Daryl (Connor Cruise) whos distraught to see his dad the Spokane mayor collaborating with the enemy -- are plucky rebels who take to combat with remarkable ease. The pic fleetingly suggests that vidgame experience fortuitously prepared them for real-life fighting. (Still one commando isnt entirely grateful ""Dude were living Call of Duty. And it sucks."") Battle scenes are infused with a propulsive sense of urgency as Bradley (a vet stunt coordinator and second unit director) often achieves an effective semi-documentary look with Mitchell Amundsens skittish handheld lensing and Richard Pearsons kinetic editing. Pic was shot on Michigan locales that persuasively double for the scripts Pacific Northwest setting. Between stretches of full-tilt excitement ""Red Dawn"" slows down for sequences in which actors must deliver dialogue that ranges from serviceable to risible. (Hemsworth and Peck must do some especially heavy lifting.) From time to time the thesps are a tad too passionately intense for their own good and aud giggles may result. Elsewhere the film takes entirely too long to explain the full scope of the North Korean invasion -- how it was accomplished what other U.S. cities have been overrun etc. -- giving skeptical viewers too much time to pick holes in the thin plot. Late in the action however a few questions are helpfully answered by co-stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan (more or less channeling the originals Powers Boothe character) and Kenneth Choi (the pics token Asian good guy). Still some nagging questions will remain unanswered until ""Red Dawn"" hits theaters Nov. 21. Despite the original pics nostalgic appeal to many Baby Boomers and Gen-Xers will the title have any resonance at all for the remakes obvious target demographic of young male auds? Or will the new action-adventure rely more heavily on the marquee value of Chris Hemsworth (who actually filmed ""Thor"" and ""The Avengers"" after this pic) and the cross-generational allure of all-American semi-militarized ass-kicking?

""Well need to be smart"" Chris Hemsworths handsome Marine on leave tells his young group of press-ganged freedom fighters. If only the screenwriters had listened to their own advice. As Jed Eckert in the remake of 1984s ""Red Dawn"" Hemsworth leads Josh Peck Josh Hutcherson and some other people in a campaign of asymmetrical warfare against an occupying force of invading North Koreans. (Adrianne Palicki Isabel Lucas and the handful of other actresses are mostly silent but always look great.) One day life is all football games and T.G.I. Fridays; the next its paratroopers wiring up C4 explosives and machine-gunning checkpoint guards. Despite a fundamental breakdown of the only reality these kids have ever known everyone seems to take to their new career as American Mujahideen. There are some sullen moments here and there (""You left us when Mom died"") but by and large field dressing wounds and stealing briefcases with high-tech communications devices comes pretty quickly. This would be fine perhaps even ""bad ass"" as kids are wont to say if this movie was you know fun. But its not. The movie strives for realism so its inane storyline will inspire vague interest at best and abject irritation at worst. Sensitivities surely vary but I wouldnt argue with anyone who finds the imagery in the film racist considering the movie is almost done before we meet a ""good"" Asian-American. ""Red Dawn"" is one of those viewing experiences where you come away and think ""Where did the movie go?"" There arent that many run-and-gun guerrilla hits yet those are the only scenes that cut above the bland drone of interchangeable characters doing a whole lot of nothing. Some of the kids have maybe three lines which is more than the villains. Other than mean Captain Lo who is blessed with a few malicious close-ups the bad guys dont speak at all. The movie really does all it can to prevent you from taking it at face value. Now if North Korea really did align with other rogue nations and get backing from Russia to secure key sections of the Northwest youd think theyd be sharp enough to secure empty nearby buildings when the new Prefect was holding a rally. But no our band of rebels are able to just waltz up makeshift Texas School Book Depositories time and again to kick off their heroics. ""Red Dawn"" is one of the rare cases where a movie isnt just poor it is inadvisable. It is even perhaps irresponsible given the current political climate. The meat of ""Red Dawn"" remains free of politics which is actually a detriment to the story but it opens with a montage of rock solid xenophobia and saber-rattling against Kim Jong-un the young new leader of North Korea. Its almost preposterous enough to elicit laughter. Almost. The unfortunate thing is that some viewers may be naive to think that the movies scenario is rooted in some sort of realism. While I like to look down my nose at such rubes just as much as the next guy perhaps there are some large-ish budget movies that just shouldnt be made. Listen I love being inappropriate but you have to earn it. This paint-by-numbers picture with false drama and middling action has next to nothing to justify its very existence. ""Red Dawn"" on a fundamental level is garbage.
