Taken in that context you cant deny that it succeeds because its every bit as dour emotionless and nonsensical as Quantum of Solace. Angelina Jolie adopts a licence to pout and a small ocean of hair dye as the slippery indestructible Evelyn Salt. Shes a svelte CIA operative married to a lovey-dovey arachnologist (arent they all?) whose loyalty is thrown into question when the Cold War flares up again and shes implicated in a Russian conspiracy to have the US vapourised. Its a pulpy weakly political yarn that strains to maintain momentum by concealing Salts true allegiance although small not very subtle details (Why the hell didnt she just shoot me back there?) essentially reveal which flag shes flying. Australian director Noyce has pedigree in this field specifically his 90s Jack Ryan movies Patriot Games and Clear and Present Danger yet the focus here is less on creating a credible set of characters and motives than on manufacturing an excuse to have Jolie leapfrog between high-speed lorries. There is the odd moment of exhilaration such as a vertiginous shot of Salt clinging to the side of an apartment block having evaded her captors though mostly Noyce demonstrates little feel for movement rhythm or flow often allowing fights chases and ideas to deflate just at the point you feel they should be hitting a higher gear.

Spy ""Salt"" and ""Farewell."" By David Denby In Phillip Noyces new movie Angelina Jolies unending stare says that her character Evelyn Salt is impervious; her cool lies in how little she responds to what happens to her.   Credit Photograph by Andrew Schwartz / Courtesy Sony Pictures In the spy thriller ""Salt"" Angelina Jolie gets quite a workout. She kicks karate-chops and pistol-whips about thirty men. She kills many others with such weapons as a machine gun a broken bottle and handcuff chains which she uses to strangle a guy. She jumps from an overpass onto a moving truck and from there onto another; she rappels down an elevator shaft without a rope; and she blows a hole in the floor of St. Bartholomews Church on Park Avenue so that the man speaking in the pulpit the President of Russia will fall into the basement where she is waiting to shoot him. She also uses a syringe to draw a paralyzing fluid from a hairy black spider the size of a fist. I could easily do most of these things myself but wrangling the spider is beyond me. In brief Columbia Pictures has worked hard to establish a female equivalent to the ""Bourne"" franchise. (The end of the movie all but sells popcorn for a sequel.) The formula is similar Jolies character Evelyn Salt is an insider (a C.I.A. agent) who is also a hunted outsider (a possible Russian mole and assassin). Salt is always on the move--she dashes through the bowels of buildings she has never entered before and escapes innumerable encounters with fully armed security agents who obligingly present tender parts of their bodies for her to attack. Heroic inexorability is of course a movie staple going back to the silent serials and theres no reason that women shouldnt be super-studs too. Jolie is in great shape and watching her tear through the sets is entertaining even if we know that stunt doubles and computer-generated digits are doing some of the work. Staring everybody down Jolie never blinks. In this she resembles Leonardo DiCaprio. Is the steady gaze something taught to good-looking children in order to turn them into movie stars? And why I wonder have the Russians been revived as the enemy? Are Middle Eastern terrorists washed up as villains? The story by the screenwriter Kurt Wimmer revives Cold War wickedness presented without irony. It seems that years ago Russian children were kidnapped taken to an abandoned monastery in Siberia and trained by a kind of Soviet Fu Manchu to speak English with American accents and idioms. Then they were planted in this country as sleeper agents. In the present a defector named Orlov (the veteran Polish actor Daniel Olbrychski) turns himself in to the C.I.A. and fingers Salt as one of the spies. The chase is on. What follows--assassination threats to the American President a possible missile strike on the Middle East--is perhaps a little overblown; the actual Russian sleepers who were recently booted out of the country seem to have mainly kept a close watch on top-secret goings on in Montclair New Jersey. The movie has an air of momentousness yet most of it is conventional though well-directed pop mayhem. The director Phillip Noyce stages the action with a decent amount of space around the fights rather than the usual closeups of whirling limbs. I cant say if this nicely crafted nonsense will sell as a franchise but I know that I miss the unpretentiousness of the ""Bourne"" movies. Jason Bourne after all is merely trying to defend himself and retrieve his erased identity. In the person of Matt Damon hes a sombrely appealing man--tormented and for all his violence rather soulful. By contrast Jolies unending stare says that Evelyn Salt is impervious; her cool lies in how little she responds to what happens to her. Shes an advanced fighting machine an attempt at instant myth. I find her iciness repellent yet she certainly dominates the movie. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber play Salts superiors in the C.I.A. Schreiber saturnine as always growls a lot and Ejiofor reacts to everything with openmouthed wonder. The tricky plot locks them into purely functional responses. Noyce hasnt figured out how to free them as actors to give them a moment or two of play even a witty aside. ""Salt"" is as impersonal an action thriller as weve seen in years. The President is played by Hunt Block a bland-looking soap-opera actor. (Can that really be his name?) Block conveys so little strength that when the President gets conked on the noggin and knocked out you dont even register that hes no longer an active figure in the scene. Hes not worthy it seems of kissing Salts hyperactive black boots. Treating espionage as a fantasy liberates action filmmaking but a dramatization of how espionage actually works turns out to be a lot more interesting. In the mesmerizing French spy movie ""Farewell"" which is based on a true story the time is April 1981 in a sunny but morose Moscow. Monolithic statues of scowling Soviet heroes loom over public squares and parks a farcical reminder of old victories old illusions. Groups of white-shirted children perhaps the only citizens who still believe in the countrys greatness march around bravely singing patriotic songs. In a mood of fervent disgust a K.G.B. colonel Sergei Grigoriev (Emir Kusturica) decides that if the country is to survive the old order must be destroyed. He approaches a young French engineer Pierre Froment (Guillaume Canet) who is working in Moscow for a French company and dumps important secrets in his lap including the names of K.G.B. agents and industrial spies working in America and Europe. Froment is initially terrified. But grudgingly he moves the information West and when Francois Mitterrand (Philippe Magnan) and Ronald Reagan (Fred Ward) acknowledge the act as a victory for the free world he begins to enjoy--however nervously and guiltily--the excitements of a double life. Froment is also intrigued by Grigoriev who wants neither money nor asylum and is more than willing to face death. Violating every canon of spycraft Grigoriev meets Froment openly--in the subway in automobiles at a playground. The men utterly different in temperament fight like a married couple but draw close sharing personal as well as professional secrets. The director Christian Carion must have wanted the clash of strong personalities--men who are used to getting their own way--because he chose as his stars two prominent movie directors. Kusturica now in his mid-fifties and best known here as the director of ""When Father Was Away on Business"" (1985) is a formidable-looking intellectual bruiser with a barrel chest a heavy brow and deep-set eyes. His Grigoriev is playfully aggressive a sardonic wit a nonchalant sexual dynamo who though a married man shtups a blond K.G.B. staffer (Dina Korzun) in the agency library. Grigorievs despair gives him a kind of defiant gaiety abetted by what Froment sends his way--bonbons from the West including poetry and French champagne. Kusturica is enormously charismatic--watching him we think that no mere actor could project this much authority. And Guillaume Canet the director of ""Tell No One"" (2007) holds up his end. Handsome in an assistant-professorish way--neatly clipped beard horn-rimmed glasses--he makes Froment an irritable young man who has abundant personal ambition but no particular values. Canet has a natural severity Kusturica a natural flirtatiousness. Its an odd-couple movie with the world at stake. Carion and the screenwriter Eric Raynaud adapting a novel by Sergey Kostine (which was based on the actions of a real K.G.B. official Vladimir Vetrov) want us to understand the everyday reality of espionage--for instance the way habitual lying corrodes family life. Both mens marriages begin to come apart and Grigoriev finds himself violently at odds with his rebellious teen-age son who mistakenly thinks that his father is a pillar of the Soviet order. The domestic scenes play out with considerable emotion and the spying episodes are quick and precise a walk in the park an exchange of world-altering information and the moment is over. Carion avoids the cliches of the genre--the heavy shadows lurking figures and menacing music. The movie is stunningly intelligent; the concluding passages in which the game abruptly ends for both men are frightening and finally very moving. ""Farewell"" is Frances way of saying ""We played a role in the collapse of the Soviet Union too."" As Mitterrand Philippe Magnan is so dour with pursed lips and a lowered chin that he seems to have stepped out of ""Alice in Wonderland"" but Mitterrand who hated Communists does the right thing which is to pass the secrets to the Americans. Fred Ward playing Reagan with a pile of dark glossy hair makes the President bluff a little crude and ruthlessly calculating. The way Carion tells it Reagan was obsessed with John Fords ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" which he keeps showing in fragments to a puzzled aide. That movie like this one is about devastatingly effective actions hidden from the public view. In ""Farewell"" the leaders do their job but its the strange tense relationship between two cranky men the movie suggests that helped change the world.

As I think back I have no clue why the guy at the beginning did the thing with the or why Saltthats the name of the fugitive CIA agent played by Angelina Joliewould need to or why the villain could turn out to be Its impossible impossible to parse. But what Salt lacks in coherence it makes up in centrifugal force. You might not know why Salt is doing what shes doing but you know while youre watching that Jolie knows. The actresss certainty is diabolical. It has to be since shes acting in a vacuum. After Salt is fingered as a Russian sleeper agent by a defector (Daniel Olbrychski) who then never mind it makes no sense she has to escape from her erstwhile CIA colleagues. Much of Salt is Salt running away as Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor yell Salt Stop Salt She jumps off an overpass and onto a passing truck and then rolls over and kicks a motorcyclist off his bike and weaves on the bike between a jam-up of cars while the bullets zing past her. Salt Salt Stop Shell never stop. Shes on the hunt for her kidnapped German husband (August Diehl) an authority on spiders. Did he fall for her spidery grace her cool disregard of gravity her fanged smile? No he fell for the pre-envenomed child below the surface. Now Salt will blow away anyone who stands between her and reclaiming that dewy innocence. Director Phillip Noyce and writer Kurt Wimmer must have ticked off the heroes to be bested Bond Bourne Bauer Whos missing? MacGyver Watch Salt use household chemicals to turn a fire extinguisher into a rocket launcher. Watch her go where 007 would fear to tread the womens lav where she tapes up a wound with a maxi pad. Salt strides down a hotel corridor plucks an outfit off a rack of dry-cleaned clothes opens the door to her suite takes in the roomsall in one fluid motion without a wasted beat. Thats the movie brisk efficient forward-ho even when the plot does loop-de-loops fluid even when the action is smash-and-bash. Noyce knows theres nothing as potent as Jolies face which can turn in an instant from open and tremulous to hard and mocking. We never stop trying to read it. This isnt a high-camp performance like her insouciant Lara Croft. Salt is drawn and stricken emotionally off balance at her most physically poised. We dont know what the hell shes up to but we root for her. After a shocking act of violence James Newton Howards music goes from plaintive to syncopated and a female choir begins to chant. It sounded to me like Salt Salt Salt Salt Thats what I wanted it to be anyway. Because I wanted to sing along. The weeks second Russki spy picture Christian Carions Farewell (originally LAffaire Farewell) is less incandescent but far more enlightening. Im shocked that I didnt know the story of Vladimir Vetrov (code name Farewell) a Soviet colonel who in 1981 and 82 turned over to French intelligence the identities of enough spies to deal the KGB a near-fatal blowand ultimately help Ronald Reagan claim credit for winning the war on Communism. Vetrov is here called Sergei Grigoriev and played by Serbian director Emir Kusturica as a rumpled grouch with a fondness for haute French culture and a conviction that the Soviet Union has been so poisoned by fools and blackguards that the only hope is sweeping the board clean and beginning again. To keep the KGB off the scent the French make Grigorievs Moscow contact a timid rather neurotic bureaucrat Pierre Froment (played by French director Guillaume Canet) and the pairs uneasy relationship gives this deliberate underpopulated movie an unexpected fullness. As children scramble up a statue of Lenin Grigoriev proclaims that hes risking his life for his sons future but his son disdains him for being out of touch and keeping a mistress. Froment is on tenterhooks at the prospect of imperiling his own family. As both men lie to loved ones to keep their exchange alive the tension builds and becomes unbearable. In the great cast Fred Ward plays Reagan as not just engaged but swaggering and overexcitablea fun revisionist performance. But this is Kusturicas movie. Grigorievs once-chiseled face is sagging gone to seed and he cant seem to settle on a smirk or a scowl on cynicism or righteous fury. Farewell gives Grigoriev a much more sentimental last act than his real-life counterpart who stabbed his mistress in a parked car and killed a KGB colleague. But Kusturica is so brooding and subtle that a turn like that would seem movie-ish. Salt Sony Pictures. PG-13. Farewell NeoClassics Films. Not Rated. E-mail filmcriticnewyorkmag.com.

Angelina Jolie stars in the spy-action flick Salt. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald7/21/2010 Editor rating 3 The Cold War heats up again in Salt an old-school spy vs. spy action film complete with elaborate car and foot chases deadly sleeper agents and frosty-eyed vodka-shooting Soviet stalwarts who lament the fall of Communism and chortle evilly over the possibility of destroying the United States. In a way Phillip Noyces film is the anti-Inception; its never dazzling but its never confusing either. Its a Bourne movie minus the exotic locations and sickening handheld camera and its head spy has way better lips than Matt Damon. Give or take a doublecross or two Noyce (Catch a Fire The Quiet American) offers up a straightforward thriller and anybody who prefers to watch movies without resorting to extensive cerebral gymnastics should enjoy the familiar ride which comes with a swift pace and a solid cast. Angelina Jolie is happily in tough-girl mode here as modern-day CIA agent Evelyn Salt married to a mild-mannered German scientist (August Diehl one of the German soldiers who got splattered all over the bar in Inglourious Basterds). Salt excels in her job although she does prompt a fair question to the United States government Do you really want your top covert mission specialist to look quite that conspicuous? No matter. Salt is tough smart resourceful and exquisitely trained; she survived a stint in a North Korean prison even. She probably couldve ended the Cold War faster than Ronald Reagan given the opportunity -- though for which side remains somewhat in question. See a Russian source has accused Salt of being a sleeper agent saying she was brainwashed by the Soviets as a child and is preparing to unleash a can of Communist whoop-ass on U.S. soil. Salts colleagues are split. One (Liev Schreiber) steadfastly refuses to believe the accusation is true. Another (Chiwetel Ejiofer) is suspicious and thinks an investigation is warranted. And then Salt runs justifying his skepticism and throwing the federal agency into a tizzy. The rest of the film is basically one chase after another but Noyce choreographs his action carefully and sets up a nicely paranoid scenario that makes it hard to trust any of the characters. The screenplay is more fond of cheap tricks than it should be and Salt cant quite survive an in-depth analysis. Still theres a good bit of fun to be had with this throwback even if its not the most original movie at your local theater. Cast Angelina Jolie Liev Schreiber Chiwetel Ejiofer August Diehl.

This Storymovie reviews Jolies Salt and Walkers Zero bring heat to Cold War storiesAngelina Jolie is out to prove shes an actress worth her SaltQamp;A with Angelina Jolie and the cast of SaltAngelina Jolie Action HeroWatch Salt trailerView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Dressed in a short-skirted black suit adorned only by a knockout of an emerald ring matching ear bobs and a few inconspicuous tattoos Jolie looks both unattainably gorgeous and improbably of-this-world. The sculptural cheekbones and pillowy lips bear only the most scant dusting of makeup (although its difficult to fathom the reality of eyelashes that reach all the way to Arlington). The fingernails however are cut short devoid of polish. The face may say Movie Star but the hands say Mother of Six. That duality fits right in with ""Salt"" the action spy thriller opening Friday in which Jolie plays a would-be Russian sleeper spy of uncertain loyalties. In the course of what amounts to a pulse-pounding 90-minute chase from Washington to New York and back again Jolie gets to do a lot of things jump shoot kick the spit out of a cordon of broad-shouldered Secret Service agents dye her hair dress in full-on dude drag. But even in the midst of ""Salts"" most fantastical action hints of practicality peek through. Jolie might be wearing towering nude heels in real life but in the movie the first thing Salt does is take off her pumps to run. ""Theres no way running in heels"" Jolie says laughing at how often women in movies sprint down streets in 4 1/2 -inch Louboutins. ""There was no way I was going to do that"" If ""Salt"" makes anything clear its that the most superhuman stunt Jolie performs in the movie cant be found in the over-the-top set pieces or in her deceptively layered performance as the films slippery title character -- or even in the marmoreal perfection she has reached as a physically flawless screen object. Rather by starring in the kind of movie that made Sean Connery Harrison Ford and Matt Damon household names Jolie has undertaken no less an audacious feat than redefining female stardom itself.    Women have starred in action movies before a ripped Linda Hamilton in the ""Terminator"" movies; angular square-jawed Jamie Lee Curtis in ""True Lies""; and most recently a fembotic Milla Jovovich in the ""Resident Evil"" series. And certainly serious actresses have dabbled in action including Sigourney Weaver who reprised her groundbreaking tough-girl performance in ""Alien"" in last years ""Avatar"" and Halle Berrys regrettable macha turn in ""Catwoman."" But Jolie who at 35 has won an Oscar for her role in the 1999 drama ""Girl Interrupted"" and now commands 20 million per picture has made action a consistent and crucial part of her meteoric rise. Unlike Meg Ryan Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock Jolie has largely avoided the romantic-comedy ghetto of the highly paid sisterhood (hey even Kate Winslet did the date-night confection ""The Holiday""). Instead shes toggled between serious dramas (""A Mighty Heart"" ""Changeling"") and rock em-sock em action pictures (""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" ""Wanted"") managing to carve out a career all her own -- and hitherto unseen in Hollywood. Jolies success as an action heroine has helped her create a persona that both on-screen and off- has transfixed audiences through hits and bombs alike. ""You know I took kickboxing lessons and all that when I was really young"" Jolie explains in a soft voice. ""I was a bit of a tomboy. . . . I just feel like Ive been so lucky that Ive been allowed by audiences to do very heavy drama and big action movies and that balance has been so lovely in my life. Ive been able to go to those very heavy places and spend months very internally as a woman and explore my emotions and then a year later when Im feeling very soft and want to get out and feel strong Im encouraged to do that too."" Theres no question that action has been Jolies most popular genre since she first made ""Lara Croft"" in 2001. That movie and its sequel grossed more than 430 million between them worldwide; ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" grossed more than 230 million; ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" a romantic action comedy Jolie made with now real-life romantic partner Brad Pitt grossed 478 million; and the pulp-noir fantasy ""Wanted"" made more than 340 million. By comparison ""A Mighty Heart"" based on the agonizing real-life story of reporter Daniel Pearls widow Mariane made a little less than 19 million and the period melodrama ""Changeling"" (this time about an agonizing mother) made 113 million. Jolies embrace of raw kinetic action has proved canny at a time when action has become an essential part of the film grammar a guarantor of attracting the all-important teenage male audience. And surely her grit and guts have become an accepted trope in Hollywood where Cameron Diaz (""Charlies Angels"" ""Knight and Day"") can engage in more playful versions of Jolies harder-edged exploits. The reality that Jolie has acknowledged and helped create is that women are no less feminine for being as brave and agile as men; if anything mixing it up makes her more limber and believable as a player at a time when no one questions a womans ability to lead in any field.

Popcorn thriller Salt features a joyless Jolie BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Jul 23 2010 (...) Andrew Schwartz SMPSP Angelina Jolie stars as ""Evelyn Salt"" in Columbia Pictures contemporary action thriller SALT. Columbia Pictures Angelina Jolie stars as ""Evelyn Salt"" in Columbia Pictures contemporary action thriller SALT. Angelina Jolie is a diabolical double agent whos been implanted in the American power structure to provoke chaos. And so is the character she plays in ""Salt"" a serviceable spy thriller from collaborators who have done better.Philip Noyce who directed Jolie in ""The Bone Collector"" (and Harrison Ford in his Jack Ryan movies) demonstrated his sociopolitical smarts in ""The Quiet American"" ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" and ""Catch a Fire.""But now hes back to delivering popcorn. Its no surprise that this vehicle moves briskly but its disappointing that Jolie rides shotgun so joylessly. As Evelyn Salt a CIA agent who goes on the run after a Russian defector accuses her of being a mole shes got an arsenal of superhuman skills but little of the wit or allure she flashed us in ""Wanted"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith.""Because she works undercover for an oil company Salt is necessarily a secretive character. But even her marriage to a German entomologist (August Diehl) is a sketch instead of a portrait. Hot on Salts tail are CIA agents played by Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber. The latter is Salts closest friend and believes shes being framed -- until the fugitive agent infiltrates a state funeral at St. Patricks Cathedral for a brazen assault on a world leader. The notion that Jolie would play a communist traitor is intriguing but anyone whos ever seen a spy movie can predict the double and triple crosses that nullify any nuanced politics.""Salt"" is reassuringly familiar Russians are villains nuclear launches are counted down by computerized female voices and our bravest agents can leap between speeding trucks without breaking a heel.As a consumable resource ""Salt"" goes down easy but its lacking both nourishment and flavor.

"Angelina Jolie is icy invincible and a lot of fun in Salt. Slate Sign In Sign Up Angelina Jolie is icy invincible and a lot of fun in Salt. Angelina Jolie is icy invincible and a lot of fun in Salt. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 23 2010 1136 AM Salt Is Angelina Jolie Shes icy invincible and a lot of fun. By Dana Stevens Also in Slate Ellen Tarlin complains about the title Salt. After youve seen Salt check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunesor directly with our RSS feed. Angelina Jolie in Salt Salt (Columbia Pictures) is a movie thats almost impossible to review without blundering into the demilitarized zone between exposition and spoilers. Just about everything that happens from the fifth minute on out is a twist with so many double-fakeouts and reversals that you finally realize theres only one principle you need to grasp to finish the ride Angelina Jolie rules. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Though the movie uses geopolitics as a backdrop positing a secret network of Russian moles planted among the American population the only real superpower in Salts world is Jolies character Evelyn Salt who as the film begins is a blond CIA agent interrogating a seemingly unbalanced Russian defector (Daniel Olbrychski). The man insists that Salt is actually a Russian double agent who was taken from her parents as a baby and trained at a Soviet spy camp as part of an evil plan to reignite the Cold War. For reasons that arent at first--or OK ever--entirely clear Salts supervisor (Chiwetel Ejiofor) takes these outlandish accusations at face value from the get-go and orders an immediate lockdown of the office. Soon Salt is barricaded in a conference room armed only with a cart of cleaning supplies and her black thong underwear both of which are deployed MacGyver-style in her spectacular escape. Advertisement A few car chases later Salt is no longer blond no longer working for the CIA and very possibly no longer Evelyn Salt. Its the metaphysical rug-pull of Salts unstable identity that gives the story its kick. Has our hero become our villain? Why does her CIA colleague Ted (Liev Schreiber) continue to believe in Salts innocence even as she makes the case against herself by continuing to flee? And what has become of Salts husband a gentle German entomologist (August Diehl)? Though Salt will appeal to Bourne fans its slicker and less gritty than those films. Also Evelyn Salt is more inscrutable and less vulnerable than Matt Damons Jason Bourne; every time we think shes revealed a truth about herself its eventually exposed as a bluff. Had a man played the lead role which was originally written for Tom Cruise Salt would have come off as dated and predictable. With a woman--with this woman--all the invincible-spy cliches feel fresh and fun again. Jolie gets to doctor her own wounds in a bar bathroom scale the side of a building leap down an elevator shaft and--most impressively--pull off at least three successful makeovers by giving herself chic haircuts and stealing fab wardrobes on the fly. As she did in the graphic-novel adaptation Wanted Jolie makes for a natural action hero. Her physical confidence and self-possession are absolute and even if shes not doing all of her own stunts she makes you believe she could. Shes having great fun but its not smug jokey James Bond fun. Though the story is ridiculous she plays her character straight and though the inconclusive last sequence is a shameless setup for a sequel you give it a pass because truth be told youre not quite ready to be done with the icy invincible Evelyn Salt. The audiences relationship to Jolie as an off-screen superhero--a bona-fide old-school movie star--makes her ludicrously competent character seem contiguous with her real-life persona. After leaping from overpasses down onto the roofs of semis and single-handedly dispatching a White House bunker full of armed guards it seems perfectly logical that Salt--if that really is her name--might stop off at the U.N. make a speech about world hunger then head home to nurse the twins and have sex with Brad Pitt.

Jennie Punter The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 23 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Salt Directed by Phillip Noyce Screenplay by Kurt Wimmer Starring Angelina Jolie Liev Schreiber Chiwetel Ejiofor and Daniel Olbrychski Classification PG Salt. Too much can kill you and Im not talking about the stuff you sprinkle on your corn. With an icy gaze high kicks and an arsenal of nifty tricks reigning action queen Angelina Jolie gets nasty as lovely lithe and lethal CIA operative Evelyn Salt who dispatches heavily armed guys like so many pesky flies in Salt a brisk breathless bender of spy-versus-spy fluff geared for maximum multiplex action and gunning for a sequel. This is a movie with a massive Cold War hangover. Its premise - that Russian sleeper spies have been blending in with American citizens for years just waiting to be activated and execute evil plans - might have seemed preposterously old school were it not for the recent U.S.-Russia spy swap in Vienna. (The producers thank you Washington and Moscow.) Veteran director Phillip Noyce best known for his adaptations of two Tom Clancy spy novels ( Patriot Games Clear and Present Danger) and cinematographer Robert Elswit deliver a barrage of pulse-racing old-fashioned-thriller jolts. They keep our heroine on the run as she scales down buildings (no fire escapes for this lady) jumps between fast-moving vehicles and causes havoc at a state funeral (a dandy scene in which Salt blasts the pipe organ causing a discordant and sinister drone to accompany the panic). This is accomplished with her ironed-straight hair unruffled and her makeup fresh. Salt doesnt look so great in the films opening scene in which she withstands brutal torture in her skivvies in a North Korean prison. This most realistically violent scene leaves a mark on us and is part of what keeps us guessing - as the movies ""Who is Salt?"" tagline asks - at the heroines true mission and motivation. Released from the prison thanks to the efforts of her sweetheart a German arachnologist Salt wants nothing more than a CIA desk job after years in the field. But her dreams are dashed when she is pulled in with her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schrieber) and counterintelligence officer William Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to interrogate a coy older Russian spy (Daniel Olbrychski) who comes in from the cold and surprises everyone in the room by claiming that Salt is a sleeper spy. The Russian escapes and so does Salt beginning a Jason Bourne-like run from her sympathetic boss and Peabody who is less convinced shes innocent of this charge. Managing to keep just seconds ahead of a gaggle of law-enforcement pursuers - who start looking more like clueless boneheads as the action escalates toward a possible doomsday scenario - Salt is a slippery character in more ways than one. To the filmmakers credit the movie stays one step ahead of the audience offering up tantalizing bits of Salts childhood back-story and keeping us wondering whether were watching an elaborate revenge fantasy a double-agent mystery or something else entirely. For all its action thrills Salt is relatively humourless fare. There are a few minor chuckles like Salts MacGyver-like use of her pantyhose to block a surveillance camera and of a maxi-pad to bandage a flesh wound. While this role was originally written for a male star (and reportedly offered to Tom Cruise) Jolie certainly owns it. But the story itself never provides a level of intrigue - say the kind that surrounds Salts main female action rival in films these days Lisbeth Salander - that leaves you looking forward to the sequel.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Thought the recently swapped Russian spy Anna Chapman was foxy? Hah. The title character of ""Salt"" about a CIA operative accused of being a Russian mole looks just like Angelina Jolie. All right it is Jolie. And forget that her paycheck for portraying ace of spies and new franchise protagonist Evelyn Salt is a reported 20 million. What must really have set Sony Pictures back was staging that whole Russian-spy tie-in a couple of weeks ago. We jest but the coincidence of the adrenaline-revved film with the Cold War-esque kerfuffle is a rich one. ""Salt"" entertains with a bygone faceoff that is more easily understood (at least in hindsight) than the Wests current one with al-Qaeda its offshoots and its wannabes. Old-school nuclear brinksmanship even makes a cameo. In ""Salt"" a graying Cold Warrior turned defector arrives at the CIA with a fable from the bad old days. Daniel Olbrychski brings underplayed gruffness to the mysterious lethal Orlov as he tells his dark tale to Salt who is interrogating him. He recounts the machinations of a spymaster and the indoctrination of children for a diabolically patient plan to draw the U.S. into a war. It will start with the murder of the Russian president on American soil. His kicker? The name of the assassin is Evelyn Salt. And so begins a wild and satisfying ""Is she or isnt she?"" ride. ""Salt"" actually opens two years earlier with the agent in a very Jack Bauer fix in a North Korean prison. What saves her is the devotion of spider expert Mike Krause (August Diehl) who becomes her husband. Salt adores Krause whos plunged into danger as soon as Orlov names her. Her escape is about saving him. Or is it? Are her flashbacks of sweet courtship and pretty nuptials true or just remembrances of a highly evolved cover? Liev Schreiber as Salts handler Ted Winter squares off against Chiwetal Ejiofor as her hunter counterintelligence agent Peabody. Peabody wants to ""bring her in or bring her down."" Winter still believes in his agent. Casting Schreiber in the midst of the action delivers a nice bonus. The powerfully able performer played the title character in Jonathan Demmes update of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (2004) based on Richard Condons novel about a brainwashed plant. New kind of chick flick? Along the way to a tick-tick- tick conclusion Jolie pulls off improbable feats. Since shes been kicking hiney and taking no prisoners for a decade now (starting with ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"") Jolies ongoing action successes seem to provide evidence of an evolving cultural story. Are films like ""Salt"" and the physically vigorous Lisbeth Salander series playing at art houses (""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" ""The Girl Who Played With Fire"") expanding other fustier definitions of the chick flick? After all theres hankering here. Theres love. Relationships matter. But they can be very dodgy. Trust is an issue. Betrayal seems a probability. Kurt Wimmers screenplay mimics the challenges in trusting a spy. One minute were certain Salt is a heroine we can believe in. Then her actions suggest otherwise. Is she on the run or on the job? Is she clearing her name or carrying out a long-programmed mission? This is well- seasoned stuff. Swiftly paced ""Salt"" is directed by Phillip Noyce the intelligently sensitive filmmaker who helmed the Tom Clancy- Jack Ryan films ""Patriot Games"" (1992) and ""Clear and Present Danger"" (1994) and the very fine adaptation of Graham Greenes twisting drama ""The Quiet American"" (2002). Noyce knows his way around the S-curves of politically charged sagas. Hes also capable of maneuvering emotional and ethical dilemmas. Action doesnt race rough shod over the tale of a spy whose allegiances arent clear. Still some sequences are brazenly silly. Salt hurtles like a skipped stone from one tractor-trailer to another to a smaller truck on a highway that loops D.C. She maneuvers down an elevator shaft like Spidey only with no web. Granted the physically preposterous has become an action-flick staple. So too is a propulsive score. This one is the work of James Newton Howard. Fortunately Jolie is the movies never-idling engine. Yet she knows how to still the nonstop with those eyes that mouth that face. ""SALT."" PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action. 1 hour 40 minutes.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 23 2010 Save for later Saved Salt scene Angelina Jolie stars as Evelyn Salt. Andrew Schwartz/Columbia Pictures - Sony/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In her new movie ""Salt"" Angelina Jolie is outfitted in blond wigs black wigs jumpsuits pantsuits. She can appear eerily strait-laced in one scene and goth in the next. Shes probably the most dynamic action star in the movies right now and certainly the most exotic. In ""Salt"" shes playing a role that originally was meant for Tom Cruise; I dont lament the switch. The part could just as easily have been set up for Matt Damon. Although the principal filmmakers - director Phillip Noyce screenwriter Kurt Wimmer and cinematographer Robert Elswit - seem to have had a ""Bourne""-style franchise in mind their film is a bit too wiggy and perverse for that.Its also unapologetically a throwback to cold warriorism. Jolie plays Evelyn Salt a CIA undercover superspy first seen in flashback being tortured by her North Korean captors - just to set the films temperature. (All in a days work.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Two years later in Washington D.C. where Evelyn is cozily ensconced with her doting German arachnologist husband (August Diehl) she is named as a Russian spy by a Russian defector (Daniel Olbrychski) who also warns of an imminent assassination attempt in the US against the visiting Russian president. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Denying the accusation fearful for her husbands safety Evelyn flees the CIAs dragnet and spends much of the rest of the film slicing dicing blasting garroting slithering down elevator shafts falling out of planes and doing high-rise backflips onto speeding semis. And all of this without so much as a smirk. Shes not even afraid of spiders.Despite the fact that Evelyns calisthenics at least at first are propelled by her love for her husband shes not a romantic. Shes too glaceed and otherworldly for that. Jolie resembles here as she did to an even greater extent in the ""Lara Croft"" movies and ""Wanted"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" a supersized action figure. Theres an animatronic blankness to her features (even allowing for the fact that Evelyn must always be wary of revealing her true emotions).Paradoxically this blankness makes her more compelling than the usual action emoter because we are never quite sure what shes up to or when shell explode. Evelyn is almost preternaturally cunning - in less than a minute she can fashion a wastebasket and fire extinguisher into a lethal weapon - but she doesnt appear to need any time to machinate. Provoked she turns into an instant destructo machine.Noyce made his Hollywood name with the Tom Clancy adaptations ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"" but in recent years he showed his real worth as an artist with such films as ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" and the Graham Greene adaptation ""The Quiet American"" featuring one of Michael Caines two or three best performances.In ""Salt"" he does a commendable job as a director-for-hire especially in the action scenes although the flashback sequences are stiff and theres an undue amount of exposition involving CIA and Russian operatives standing around explaining the plot to us. Even though good actors such as Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor are doing the explaining (or disinforming?) theyre essentially just taking up space. What we really want to see is Evelyn that new-style Mata Hari do her drop kicks.(Speaking of casting why is Andre Braugher a great actor given a glorified walk-on as the US secretary of Defense? Hes ranked high in the billing so much must have been left on the cutting-room floor.)Although Middle East terrorism is cited at one point ""Salt"" could easily have been conceived in the 1960s. Theres something oddly comforting about this - just as in a way the recent discovery of Russian spies living double lives in the US harked back to a (seemingly) simpler time. Im not trying to champion Commie nostalgia here but the filmmakers might be.At a time when the real world of modern global terrorism inserts itself into even the most comic book-style escapades - ""The A Team"" anyone? - its no wonder that political action filmmakers are looking for ways to heat up the screen without giving audiences real-world nightmares. Casting about for new villains Hollywood has settled on a safe solution Bring back the old villains.The only thing missing from ""Salt"" is Lotte Lenyas Rosa Klebb with her steel blade-tipped shoes from ""From Russia With Love."" Come to think of it the Russian defector here does indeed kill with steel-blade shoes. Nice touch.

What purpose would be served I asked myself by cataloguing the manifold deficiencies of the Angelina Jolie spy thriller Salt a second-tier summer offering unlikely to inspire much critical or commercial enthusiasm anyway? But as I was coming to this conclusion the film itself shamed me back into an appreciation of my duty. It happened near the end when the heroine committed a homicide that was not strictly speaking necessary and another character asked her ""Why did you kill him?"" She replied firmly ""Because somebody had to.""Somebody has to. If government assassins and reviewers of mediocre summer cinema have anything in common (and in fact we have quite a bit) it is an appreciation of this Spartan credo. In this instance its best I think to be quick and businesslike avoiding emotional involvement and the unnecessary infliction of pain. So here goes. Salt is a dull dumb humorless film. Ive written before about Hollywoods failure to produce B+ (and even B-) genre films and Salt is a prime example--a movie that ought to have been a competent if uninspired entertainment but instead approximates Bourne for Dummies. Jolie stars as CIA superspy Evelyn Salt whom we first meet undergoing interrogation at the hands of North Korean intelligence. (Call me a cynic but the purpose of this opener seems less to introduce Jolies character than to introduce her tied up and in her underwear.) Fast forward a few years and Salt is back at a desk job stateside bantering with her boss (Liev Schrieber) and preparing for a romantic dinner with her husband (August Diehl) a German arachnologist. (Yes his offbeat occupation will provide the excuse for exactly one silly plot twist later on.) Work intrudes however when a self-declared Russian defector (Daniel Olbrychski) shows up on the doorstep with a story to tell. It seems that in the bad old days of the Soviet Union--which were of course the good old days for Hollywood spy movies--a plan was undertaken to place dozens of sleeper agents in the U.S. These moles would gradually assume positions of authority in preparation for a ""Day X"" when the Motherland would call upon them to bring our capitalist excesses to a violent halt. (Why this Soviet plot has survived the Soviet Union by two decades is mystery the filmmakers do not see fit to plumb.) One of the moles the defector tells Salt is poised to ignite an international incident by executing the Russian president when he visits New York. And the name of that hidden assassin is... Evelyn Salt As her superiors try to sort out what the hell is going on Salt makes a break for it she claims its because she fears her husband is in danger from whoever hatched this nefarious plot but darned if she doesnt seem to be behaving just like an enemy spy. Such is the narrative teeter-totter on which we will pass the duration of the film Is Salt a Russian assassin? A devoted wife? Neither? Both? The answer may surprise you though probably not in a good way. Jolies unusual brand of masculine magnetism is well-suited to roles such as this and for a while the film is diverting enough as a kind of upside-down No Way Out. But the limited forgivable absurdities (Salts MacGyver-like construction of a bazooka from elements of an office chair) gradually give way to a level of pandemic preposterousness that makes Ethan Hunt look like George Smiley. The attempt on the Russian presidents life is followed by another on the American presidents with a bid to launch a U.S. nuclear strike thrown in for good measure. I was vaguely relieved that the films overzealous agents didnt have time to release a global neurotoxin or roust bin Laden from his cave--though for all I know such feats await us in the directors cut. The director in question is Philip Noyce who has made spy films both contemplative (The Quiet American) and lively (Clear and Present Danger) but here opts for neither. A movie as harebrained as this needs a hint of wit and self-awareness but Salt is dour and self-serious to a fault right down to the murdered loved ones and grit-toothed promises of vengeance. This is a film so stolid that it offers a Russian agent with retractable shoe blades without even a whiff of irony. (Where have you gone Rosa Klebb?) Worst of all in keeping with the present fashion Salt has the misplaced confidence to end with a coda announcing its enthusiasm for a sequel. Heres hoping that if the box office does not lay such ambitions to rest the presumptive title of such a project--Salt II--will do the trick.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

Either way shes a one-woman weapon of sass destruction.       Photo Liev Schreiber as a CIA agent. And you thought ""Sex and the City 2"" was girly Superspy Evelyn Salt a sort of Jasmine Bourne who studies the art of napkin folding risks her life running away from the CIA so she can share her anniversary with her husband. She also makes a bazooka out of cleaning products uses her pantyhose to block a security camera saves her little doggy from armed men and deploys sanitary pads to bandage her wounds. I feel confident that in the directors-cut DVD we will find a deleted scene of her ducking bullets while sneaking out to the mailbox to renew her subscription to Real Simple. Though Salt (Angelina Jolie) does not possess any weapons as lethal as Carrie Bradshaws puns she is sleekly engineered to be one of those ""empowering"" she-heroes you supposedly never meet in any action flicks. Cue lots of scenes in which unarmed and often handcuffed she overpowers half a dozen hugely armed and highly trained men who politely line up their asses for kicking instead of just shooting her. MORE THE 25 COOLEST FEMALE CHARACTERS OF ALL-TIME The story is very proud of the way it keeps playing with expectations so I wont reveal any twists. At the outset agent Salt is released from a North Korean prison (given everything that follows why couldnt she simply have escaped and killed all her captors?). She learns back at her office in DC that a Russian defector has come in with a ludicrous story about a Russian sleeper agent being sent to assassinate his own countrys leader while the latter is in New York City to attend a former US vice presidents funeral. PHOTOS SALT FILMING IN NEW YORK The defector also claims that the Russkies have a decades-old plan to raise American-seeming babies and then unleash them as adults Stateside. One of them already did his job -- disguised as Lee Harvey Oswald. Salt who speaks Russian and used to live in Moscow starts to look suspicious herself. So she goes on the run. ""Salt"" contains many conflicts intelligence vs. counterintelligence blond Angelina vs raven-haired and . . . well thats about it. The interior lives of Salt and the other top guns at the CIA (played by among others Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor) are never dealt with. We (eventually) learn which side everybody is on but not what motivates them. The biggest conflict then is between two kinds of movies the exacting character-based 70s film vs. the blam-blam and rah-rah flicks that took over in the 1980s. At the start you may be reminded of such Ford administration classics as ""Three Days of the Condor"" -- a thriller that contains almost nothing like an action scene. Similarly ""Salt"" is most enticing when we see Jolie observing thinking plotting the next step as she outsmarts the smartest. After 40 minutes or so the blaring absurdity takes over and its an 80s action party. Im not talking Schwarzenegger movies. Im not even talking Stallone. Im talking Dolph Lundgren-Chuck Norris-grade. Salt keeps getting surrounded by large men solely so she can lay waste to them and scurry down the corridor or elevator shaft to do the same thing to the next squad of chumps. One of these guards -- and by now were in the American presidents most closely guarded space -- is defeated when Salt simply tosses a pistol that strikes him in the lip and bounces off. Which is more like a ""Naked Gun"" gag. Nor are the stunts anything special. How many times have you seen some celluloid bravo leap off an overpass and land safely on a passing truck? How many times have you seen a goon-encircled hero whirl around like a kickboxing weedwhacker and fell enemies like dandelions? ""Bourne"" director Paul Greengrass found new ways to make chases and fights visceral; this films director Philip Noyce (""Clear and Present Danger"" ""The Saint"") simply fires up the stunt-karaoke machine and replays the ancient hits. ""Salt"" is roughly as common as its titular condiment It chugs along competently enough its quickly paced and it doesnt drag out its conclusion (""Sex and the City 2"" was about 50 minutes longer). It keeps you guessing -- albeit mainly by piling on absurd twists. If it couldnt be a cerebral neo-Cold War thriller ""Salt"" could still have been a highly engaging gung-ho shoot-er-upper. Some of the cheesiest 80s action movies were more fun than this one because their heroes were trained in a technique alien to Salt a sense of humor. Russkies have a decades-old plan to raise American-seeming babies and then unleash them as adults Stateside. One of them already did his job -- disguised as Lee Harvey Oswald. Salt who speaks Russian and used to live in Moscow starts to look suspicious herself. So she goes on the run.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Salt Action. Starring Angelina Jolie Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Directed by Phillip Noyce. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Angelina Jolie can climb up the sides of buildings. She can leap from an overpass onto a truck dress her own bullet wounds and yank a guy off a motorcycle as he rides by on the highway. She can even chase an elevator thats going down by jumping from side to side along the shaft like a human fly. The woman is amazing. Now some might say that Jolie cant do these things that what were really talking about here is Evelyn Salt the heroine of the new action thriller and that Jolie is just an actress. But this is a prosaic distinction hardly worth making. ""Salt"" is a dream tailored to the public idea of Jolie as the woman who can do anything. She can do anything onscreen just as in real life she can stand next to one of the most desired men in the world and have it look like ""Oh yeah. Him."" Jolies superwoman tendencies have resulted mainly in cartoonish abrasive movies (""Wanted"" ""Tomb Raider"") worthy of neither her talent nor the intelligence of an audience older than 12. But when exploited properly - as ""Salt"" does keeping her human and vulnerable so that the characters amazing ability and ingenuity continue to surprise - this thing that Jolie does is well very cool. Making us believe in the woman who can do anything and I mean anything is Jolies distinct contribution to todays cinema.

Chiwetel Ejiofor as "" Agent Peabody"" and Liev Schreiber as ""Agent Ted Winter"" in Columbia Pictures contemporary action thriller SALT. Photo Andrew Schwartz Columbia Pictures Movie review Salt packs in superwoman feats 1 / 1 Back to Gallery This time she really doesnt want to kill anybody. Salt is a CIA agent in search of a desk job and on the day all hell breaks loose shes just looking forward to a quiet anniversary dinner at home with her kindly nerdy husband (August Diehl). Then in walks an old Soviet agent wanting to defect with a wild story to tell Apparently there are Russian nationals embedded within our intelligence agencies and at a signal they will commence their doomsday plan. And one of those agents he says is Salt. From there hold on to your hat. She goes on the run with the CIA FBI and the Secret Service after her and those Russians might want a piece of her too. Sometimes theyre chasing her and sometimes shes chasing them but throughout the movie is careful to slow down long enough for viewers to catch their breath and find their place within the story. Director Phillip Noyce strikes a modern mood and makes use of modern technologies but hes forgotten nothing of what he knew about storytelling in the 1990s when he made ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger."" In its small details ""Salt"" can seem ridiculous at times. At one point she seems to be steering a car by using a Taser on the drivers leg; each spasm makes the car accelerate. The president is presented as a moron which is a bit behind the curve and his name - President Lewis - sounds as though it were pulled from a phone book. But its no match for Vice President Maxwell Oates a name that sounds funny the first time you hear it and is repeated over and over. The main thing is that ""Salt"" holds together. Its narrative strategy is to leave audiences in the dark for much of the action but each tidbit were given fits into the broader picture. The action scenes are imaginative and elaborate without seeming fake. Nothing is belabored and the stakes never stop escalating. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Liev Schreiber offer vivid support as two distinctly different government types (the unimaginative suit and the independent thinker) and the movie never forgets the human element. Salt always has a strong emotional reason for what she does. For Jolie its the best of both worlds. For once she gets to be a woman and a superwoman in the same movie. -- Advisory This movie contains lots of violence.

"Movie review Jolie is worth her Salt - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Movie review Jolie is worth her Salt Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Salt"" the film and Evelyn Salt the character are perpetually in motion and thats a good thing for its own sake and because it keeps audiences from dwelling on how unapologetically preposterous the plot in question is.And really who goes to summer action movies for cast-iron logic anyway? Or for plausible characters for that matter? You go for brisk stunts expertly executed for well-directed action that doesnt allow you to catch your breath and for one of the preeminent action stars of our time. Yes that would be Angelina Jolie. With what she does here on top of ""Lara Craft Tomb Raider"" ""Wanted"" and ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"" Jolie has earned the right to be considered not a potent female action star but a potent action star period end of story.What makes her so good and what is visible as she deftly navigates the unending silliness of ""Salt"" are traits that add up to a fierce commitment to action a determination to make the role of a CIA agent who literally and metaphorically takes no prisoners as convincing as she can. For one thing although aided by stunt double Eunice Huthart Jolie is athletic and fearless enough to do many of her own stunts including nervy scenes of jumping from moving truck to moving truck (albeit done with the aid of cables and harnesses that were removed in post-production).The actress is also expert at projecting the ice cold fury that makes ""Salts"" fight scenes strong. Jolies dont-mess-with-me fierceness is palpable and it allows her to angrily throw herself into the martial arts action like she means every blow she strikes.Her casting makes all the difference in a part that would be completely standard if a man played it. (One of the well-known ironies of Jolies success in ""Salt"" is that screenwriter Kurt Wimmer originally wrote the role for a man.). It is the contrast between what cultural conditioning in general and Hollywood movies in particular tell us about womens roles and what Jolie can in fact accomplish that holds our interest here.If ""Salt"" wouldnt be as effective with someone else in the title role it also benefits greatly from the professional direction of Phillip Noyce who put Harrison Ford through his paces in ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger."" Though he cant do much about the films shaky foundation Noyce sets a brisk no nonsense pace and works with Oscar-winning cinematographer Robert Elswit and veteran editor Stuart Baird (""Casino Royale"" ""The Legend of Zorro"") to insure that no one on or off the screen has much time for reflection. Certainly not Evelyn Salt introduced being tortured by some angry North Koreans who dont buy her insistence that she isnt a spy. But a secret agent as she is soon telling her super-gentle arachnologist future husband Mike ( August Diehl) is just what she is working at a CIA front organization in Washington D.C. for spy boss and friend Ted Winter ( Liev Schreiber).""Salts"" action picks up wouldnt you just know it on Evelyn and spider-loving Mikes wedding anniversary. On her way out the door she is called back to interrogate possible Russian defector Orlov (longtime Andrzej Wajda collaborator Daniel Olbrychski).With Winter and counter-intelligence expert Peabody ( Chiwetel Ejiofor) looking on Orlov tells quite a tale. He says he has spent years planting a cadre of crack Russian secret agents in the U.S. Unlike the recent real-life Russian operatives uncovered in the U.S. folks whose main accomplishment was apparently cashing their checks from Moscow this is one deadly group intent on nothing less than completely destroying America.More than that Orlov says one of his people is about to go to New York to assassinate the current Russian president in town for a state funeral. That assassin he announces dramatically is none other than Evelyn Salt.Now if there was ever a time when cooler heads should prevail this would seem to be it but just the opposite happens. In fact all of ""Salt"" is based on the notion that nothing reasonable or plausible ever happens. So when a worried Evelyn decides she has to check up on her husband and then go to New York to check out that funeral she is forced to outsmart and outrun a building full of CIA types. Counter-intelligences Peabody can scream ""box her in"" all he wants but you might as well try to catch the wind.Though Schreiber Ejiofor and Olbrychski do as well as the script allows them to human relationships especially those between Evelyn and her husband are the films weakest link.

(See TIMEs summer entertainment guide.) A male action drama can be handed to any guy who looks fit enough to do a chin-up. (I mean honestly Ashton Kutcher in Killers?) The female action genre thats pretty much Angelina Jolie. With her slim voluptuous body her Easter Island-idol facial features and that smoldering I-dare-you look Jolie is one of the few contemporary star actresses who doesnt seem locked in perpetual girlhood; she was born grown up sure of herself and ready to rumble. That makes her perfect for ballsy ladies like tomb raider Lara Croft the assassin in Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith (targeting her real-life beau Brad Pitt) the daredevil pilot in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow the seductive witch-goddess of Beowulf and a secret-society supervixen -- the definitive Jolie character -- in Wanted. Shes got what no other Hollywood woman even tries for and which is embodied among recent international stars perhaps only by Hong Kong action star Michelle Yeoh feminismo. (Read TIMEs 2001 story on Jolie in Lara Croft Tomb Raider.) In Salt her new medium-fun espionage caper A. Jo takes a role originally written for Tom Cruise -- he chose to make the jokier Knight and Day instead -- and manages to ratchet up the testosterone level. Shes Evelyn Salt a CIA operative whos endured torture by the North Koreans without blowing her cover. Two years later happily married to an arachnologist who doesnt know what she does for a living Evelyn is fingered as a double agent by a Russian defector named Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski). Cue the dragnet the frenetic chases and the pounding James Newton Howard score. Salt spends the rest of the movie on the run from her friendly boss (Liev Schreiber) a relentless G-man (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and nearly every federal state and city cop in the Northeast corridor. And because in a spy movie the hero needs to be pursued by outlaws as well as lawmen Evelyn also has to watch out for a nest of Slavic superkillers bred in the Soviet Union and planted in the U.S. to carry out an assassination plot targeting two world leaders. Honoring the core premise of a bond or Bourne film -- that the main character is bold and resourceful everyone else is slow and stupid -- screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (he did the thrillers Equilibrium and Law Abiding Citizen) gets the talky parts over early and creates a series of set pieces to be efficiently executed by Australian director Phillip Noyce whose resume has alternated action stuff like Clear and Present Danger with more thoughtful political dramas Rabbit Proof Fence The Ugly American. No more a fan of facetiousness than Jolie is Noyce keeps the tone serious; he ignores the storys preposterous elements and lets the audience decide whether to laugh shudder or both -- and whether to cheer Salt on when she is revealed to be a Cold-War Russian agent with a U.S. President in her sights. (See pictures of historys most notorious Russian spies.) Noyces methods of crafting suspense are defiantly old-fashioned low-angle shots for maximum viewer disorientation and a preference for daredevil stunt work over CGI cheating. The truck-jumping scenes recall similar acrobatics performed by Yeoh and Jackie Chan in the Police Story series from Hong Kongs golden age of action movies. (The game Jolie is said to have done many of her own stunts.) Some of the action work is even more venerable Orlov overcomes two captors in an elevator with the old switchblade-in the-shoe-toe trick memorably used by Lotte Lenya as SMERSH agent Rosa Klebb in the second Bond film From Russia With Love. And since the movie is rated PG-13 it cant linger over the violent scenes. But they can still be jarring as when Evelyn breaks a mans neck with a pair of handcuffs -- a blow whose impact is more gruesome because it happens its over and Salt moves on to further mayhem. (See the best movies of the decade.) Another item on the movies nostalgia menu choosing a nonexistent superpower the former Soviet Union as the collective antagonist. During his interrogation Orlov lets the CIA in on a piece of alternate U.S. history that the Lee Harvey Oswald who returned from the U.S.S.R. to America in 1962 with a Russian wife in tow was actually a Soviet lookalike -- and its the lookalike who killed JFK. Pretty silly eh? A Russian who looks like an American setting up a domestic life while building an undercover agenda... Wait a minute. Maybe the plot isnt so silly. Think of Anna Chapman the sexy New Yorker recently arrested and deported as part of a cell of Russian spies. Give ""Agent 90-60-90"" (her measurements in centimeters) a gun a minidress and a charismatic pout and youve got Salt. Angelina Jolie must appreciate the connection. According to the New York Post she and the filmmakers invited Chapman to this weeks Moscow premiere of their movie. Only problem they cant find her. Maybe Chapman is on her latest mission and in disguise. Look for a curvaceous guy with spiders. From Pixels to Projectors See Hollywoods best video-game movies Buy reprints of TIMEs movie covers.

Salt Thrill ride shows Jolie is queen of action flicks | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSalt Thrill ride shows Jolie is queen of action flicksAngelina Jolie is taking names in Salt -- even though you know the handles will be as phony as her blond-to-black hair colour as a spy on the lam..Cleverly disguised with dark hair Agent Salt (Angelina Jolie) is a spy on the lam from government agents.  (Andrew Schwartz / Supplied photo)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. July 22 2010Salt (out of 4)Starring Angelina Jolie Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Directed by Phillip Noyce. 99 minutes. At major theatres. PGAngelina Jolie is kicking ass and taking names in Salt -- even though you know the handles will be as phony as her blond-to-black hair colour as a spy on the lam from government agents. You cant expect to trust anybody in the murky world of espionage and Salt mines that uncertainty to good advantage.One truth doubtless led the Sony studio brass to break into their happy dance when 10 real-life sleeper moles were busted and shunted off to Russia as Salt was poised to open. But dont look for too much reality in this thrill ride a relentlessly moving flick that cements Jolies position as queen of the action stars.Article Continued BelowKurt Winners script about the rise of the sleeper spy machines on Day X is fantastically loopy with just enough brushes with reality thanks to recent headlines to add a whiff of credibility. But were not here for script; we want action and as Agent Salt Jolie delivers.Originally tooled for Tom Cruise who nixed the project as being too close to his Mission Impossible ID (pity he didnt make the same call on Knight and Day) CIA Agent Edwin A. Salt is now Evelyn Salt. Shes one tough cookie when we first see her in undergoing a vicious waterboarding -- in her bra and panties a little something for the fanboys -- in a North Korean compound. Shes released in a spy swap thanks to the intervention of her husband a German spider expert who knows his bugs but failed to pass chemistry when it comes to his wife; the guy is a complete stiff. But humour us there are no throwaway lines events or people in Salt. Two years later and back in the office its all in days work for Salt as she interviews a Russian named Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) who walks in seeking to trade secrets about a plot to kill the Russian president for asylum. He spins a crazy Boys From Brazil-style tale about Russian kids being indoctrinated and raised as spies. He drops the bomb that he knows Salt was one of them and is a member of the Day X spy cell moles working and living in America undercover ready to take over the nation through organized terrorism on a signal from Moscow. Despite having the support of her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) who believes her out of the box and wont waver Salt goes on the lam. Running is the only proof uptight fellow agent Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) needs to prove her guilt and the chase is on. Director Philip Noyce (Patriot Games Clear and Present Danger) has crafted some heart-pumping chase scenes the tension hiked even higher thanks to Jolies stunt skills. Hes to be commended for keeping the CGI to a minimum and letting the actors well act. An early truck chase in which Jolie pinballs from transport to transport top will get hearts pumping. And this woman knows exactly how to use a Taser.Salt is part Jason Bourne and part James Bond except she makes her own superspy toys rather that waiting for Q to dole them out starting with turning a table leg into a bazooka. Shes also too busy to be bedding any double agents. MI also gets a nod with disguises (including Jolie dressed as a dude) and a classic face-removal scene.Winners story tries to keeps us guessing about Salts allegiances even as the story spins off into crazyland with its mixture of implausible events and impossible stunts. But the relentless action makes up for shortfalls and who says you need realism in a spy flick? Still Jolies cucumber-cool sexy spy is missing the heart to make her an enduring pop culture force like Bond Bourne or Ethan Hunt and in the end we dont much care which side shes on so long as she takes out a couple more assailants with crafty weapons and fancy-pants martial arts.Plot failings aside hot damn shes good with a gun and even better with her fists. And the fact the flick leaves the door open for a sequel makes it likely well have a chance to find out more about the icily mysterious Evelyn Salt.Read more about Angelina JolieThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Salt--accused of being a long-dormant Russian mole--dashes through the labyrinth of the agencys D.C. offices desperate to keep its surveillance system from tracking her flight. Having disabled various cameras in various ways she finally peels off her panties and drapes them over a lens. Watch a scene from ""Salt"" a new action film starring Angelina Jolie. Courtesy Columbia Pictures. And if Tom Cruise had been cast in the role instead of Angelina Jolie as originally planned? Chances are the scene would have played a bit differently. But would the movie? Not really. Based on an original screenplay by Kurt Wimmer this neo-Cold War thriller is out of the classic good-guy-as-fugitive mold about a CIA agent who may or may not have been a Russian plant and ends up with the entirety of the U.S. clandestine services breathing down her neck. As she tries to find her husband and perhaps assassinate the Russian president shes not quite sure who or what she is. And neither are we. Which is precisely why the whole thing works. Speakeasy Salt Director Phillip Noyce on Americas Fascination with Russian Spies But were equally in the dark regarding Ms. Jolie upon whom this putative tent pole is propped. She may in fact be the perfect action avatar--she often looks like she popped out of a videogame and her stardom seems to put her at an arms length from humanity anyway. What is she exactly? An actress. A megacelebrity. And apparently Hollywoods reigning female sex symbol. So wheres the sex? For that matter wheres the humor? ""Salt"" has neither and it seems to have become SOP for Ms. Jolies on-screen personae to exist on a plane unsullied by desire laughs or passion. ENLARGE Angelina Jolie as the titular CIA operative in Salt. Sony Pictures Theres something rollickingly puritanical about a film like ""Salt"" which is director Phillip Noyces first feature since the 2006 apartheid drama ""Catch a Fire"" and around which the word ""fun"" will be bandied about. It is fun Watching Ms. Jolie do her own acrobatics under the direction of her longtime stunt coordinator Simon Crane is a kick especially in an era when our knowledge of special effects have so diluted the vicarious thrills of high-wire moviemaking. As Evelyn shoots swings and flying back kicks her way through legions of foul male antagonists there may also be some subliminal/primal enhancement involved in watching a woman rather than a man doing what Ms. Jolie does--leaping from speeding truck to speeding truck along a dizzying freeway ramp or clambering along the 11th-floor ledge of an apartment building while the heads of CIA agents keep popping out of windows a la Whack-a-Mole. Most of it defies belief of course and Salts vaulting from a moving train into a clean landing on the 51st Street subway platform is really too much. But as defined by Ms. Jolie and by Mr. Wimmer our title character is less superagent than superhero. Shes also an operative with finely honed skills unlimited daring and like the movie itself vague complexities She has a strange relationship with her colleague Winter (Liev Schreiber). Her CIA superior Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is overly eager to bring her in dead or alive. Her little-seen husband Mike (August Diehl) couldnt be more colorless. While she can virtually vanish at will Salt will indeed rematerialize in a sequel--""Salt"" all but sets it up. Mr. Noyce whose best work has been in small-bore dramas (""The Quiet American"" ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"") can also handle large-caliber studio thrillers (""Patriot Games"") and isnt afraid to take inspiration where he finds it Hitchcocks ""Notorious"" and ""North by Northwest"" are his influences here as are the ""Bourne"" films directed by Paul Greengrass with their ADD editing and hallucinatory action. Theres a bit of gas-baggery--when the great Polish actor Daniel Olbrychski shows up at the beginning of the film playing the nefarious Russian Orlov we get a lengthy tutorial on the Cold War some blather about Lee Harvey Oswalds doppelganger having assassinated JFK and a storyline that seems well kind of familiar--about Russian agents living quiet lives waiting for the day when the Motherland will crush the West. As plotlines go its a lot more exciting in ""Salt"" than its been on CNN. Watch a scene from ""Countdown to Zero"" a post-Soviet rogue-nuke documentary. Courtesy Magnolia Pictures. Countdown to Zero During one of ""Salt""s more hair-raising moments the president of the United States and his aide enter a complex series of numbers and letters into the computer primed to launch a nuclear attack on Russia. The process is reassuringly complex. But among the many things we learn from the worrisome/exhilarating ""Countdown to Zero"" is that up until 1977 those so-called enable codes were all set to a single number--zero. As in 12 zeroes. Such was the response of the Strategic Air Command to Defense Secretary Robert McNamaras insistence that there be any codes at all. SAC may have been taking its cues from Gen. Jack D. Ripper of ""Dr. Strangelove."" (""War is too important to be left to politicians. They have neither the time the training nor the inclination for strategic thought."") As ""Countdown"" tells it no one in power has had enough time training or inclination to make the world anything but an incipient ashtray. The documentary which opens in New York and Washington Friday and Los Angeles next week will resonate among its audiences like a gong in a subway tunnel. Its a cautionary tale torqued up Opening with footage from various terrorist bombings of recent years--London Bali Riyadh Oklahoma City and of course New York--it makes the case that no one really wants to ponder regarding what each of those events would have become had terrorists owned The Bomb. And then it proceeds to tell us how frighteningly easy and close at hand nuclear terrorism is. ENLARGE Mikhail Gorbachev in Countdown to Zero. Magnolia No ""Countdown"" is not escapist cinema not a happy cartoon like ""Despicable Me."" Its more ""Despicable Them"" from the Russian lowlifes who trade highly enriched uranium to buy new cars to the Pakistani nuke-gangster A.Q. Khan to the entire Iranian leadership. But as odd as it may sound its a remarkably beautiful movie. Integrating all sorts of archival footage--including John F. Kennedys 1961 ""Sword of Damocles"" speech before the U.N. which echoes throughout the film--it has a sense of rhythm color and humanity that evokes melancholy rather than dread. The nighttime photography of the worlds most luminous cities awakens our sense of grief--not for whats gone but for what could be in the blink of an eye. The editing by Brad Fuller and Brian Johnson is miraculous. On top of it all is composer Peter Golubs score which few would immediately compare to Bach except for its mathematical precision contrapuntal textures and intersecting interlocking parts which suggest nothing if not the synchronized mechanics of a clock. Which by the way is ticking. Watch a scene from ""Farewell"" a French-made Cold War thriller. Courtesy NeoClassics Films. Farewell Its Cold War Week at the movies French director Christian Carions real-life espionage thriller ""Farewell"" is set at what is arguably the eras turning point Its 1981 Ronald Reagan is barely in office and Frances Francois Mitterrand presents him with a list of Soviets whove infiltrated American government and business. Mr. Mitterrand also offers an extraordinary estimate 40% of the Soviet budget is being spent on defense most of it on pilfering technology. The Soviet Union cant possibly survive the White House says. Lets propose a strategic missile-defense initiative and push em over the edge. The source of all this information was a real-life KGB agent Vladimir Vetrov code named Farewell and with the usual adjustments for drama his story gets a respectable retelling in this nervy French production. There are actually three directors in ""Farewell"" Mr. Carion; Guillaume Canet (""Tell No One"") who plays Pierre the charmless engineer and reluctant courier of top-secret information and Emir Kusturica (""Underground"") who plays Grigoriev aka Farewell a world-weary Francophile KGB colonel with a taste for cognac and a long view of history The end is near he knows; lets bring it nearer. Mr. Kusturica whose own best directing days may be behind him nevertheless gives a terrific portrayal of a man living inside his head and his history who listens to Pierres whining (""I dont want to mess up my life for the state..."") with the perfect balance of pity and contempt--and the knowledge that when its all over hell have even fewer days left than the USSR. Watch a scene from ""Valhalla Rising."" Courtesy IFC Films. ENLARGE Mads Mikkelsen as One-Eye in Valhalla Rising. IFC Films Valhalla Rising Heathens never get enough screen time but leave it to Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn to set things straight Reuniting with his longtime collaborator the increasingly visible actor Mads Mikkelsen (""Coco Chanel and Igor Stravinsky"") Mr. Refn constructs the stark violent filth-ridden world of ""Valhalla Rising"" and a pre-Christian Denmark. There the crypto-gladiator One-Eye (Mikkelsen)--led from place to place by a collar on a pole--dispatches all comers with excruciating efficiency. Sold to a group of Christians heading to the New World One-Eye becomes either the wrath of God or the lethal rebuttal to their nascent religion. As weve seen in Mr. Refns ultraviolent ""Pusher"" trilogy in ""Bleeder"" and in the underappreciated ""Bronson"" the director aims to get under ones skin but ""Valhalla Rising"" is far from pure provocation. Its a trip into a primordial world and primeval sensibilities and if youre looking to shake off the mall-movie blahs there are few better places to look. --John Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) Stanley Kubricks quintessential Cold War comedy is also one of the savvier movies period about politics in the postnuclear era. Starring Sterling Hayden as the mad general Jack D. Ripper--who decides its time to end the world--the film also features a brilliant turn by George C. Scott as the quasiclueless General Buck Turgidson and a much-celebrated triple play by Peter Sellers (as Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake U.S. President Merkin Muffley and the Kissinger-inspired Dr. Strangelove himself). And of course one shouldnt forget Slim Pickenss Maj. ""King"" Kong who rides that H bomb into oblivion and immortality. ENLARGE Seven Days in May (1964) Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas had starred together a few years earlier in ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral"" but they get into a different kind of shootout in this paranoia-fueled thriller from John Frankenheimer. Mr. Lancaster plays the popular cold warrior and chairman of the Joint Chiefs; Frederic March is the unpopular president pushing nuclear disarmament and Mr. Douglas is the military aide torn between loyalty to man and loyalty to country as he tries to prevent a coup. According to Mr. Frankenheimer Mr. Lancasters character Scott was inspired by two other generals Curtis LeMay and Douglas MacArthur. ENLARGE Thirteen Days (2000) Roger Donaldsons thriller about the Cuban Missile Crisis features a wonderfully nuanced performance by Bruce Greenwood as President John F. Kennedy who (for those who dont remember) had to stare down the Soviets over the placement of nuclear missiles in Cuba in 1962. Whether or not it works as history it certainly works as drama and includes a very credible performance by Kevin Costner as White House aide Kenny ODonnell through whom the story is told. Steven Culp is Robert F. Kennedy Dylan Baker is Robert McNamara Len Cariou plays Dean Acheson and Kevin Conway is Gen. Curtis LeMay. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune July 23 2010 -- 1026am Columbia Pictures Mct - Mct Angelina Jolie stars as Evelyn Salt whos either a Russian mole or a falsely accused U.S. patriot. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Salt"" is a throwback to pre-""Bourne"" spy movies where a subterranean level of stupidity was acceptable so long as there was plenty of mayhem. But despite enough hand-to-hand combat to glut an MMA marathon this movie is about as much fun as getting slugged in the head. Angelina Jolie plays CIA spook Evelyn Salt as a doting wife dog lover and no-nonsense careerist in the traditionally masculine world of spycraft. Then a walk-in defector fingers her as a long-dormant Brezhnev-era Russian mole and she bolts becoming a blank-faced killing machine. In clunky flashbacks we learn that a Russian spy program replaced Lee Harvey Oswald with a clone and that legions of similar undercover operatives are scattered across the free world awaiting the signal to strike. A cadre of Communist no-goodniks plans to drive the United States and Russia to the nuclear brink. Salts lethal race from Washington D.C. to New York City may be her attempt to launch the plot -- or quash it. The films slender claim on our attention is the protagonists ambiguous identity. Is she a Soviet asset activated by Cold War diehards or a falsely accused American patriot trying to protect her unsuspecting husband? On the one hand she terminates armies of U.S. agents and policemen aiming to capture her. Then again she puts the havoc on hold to rescue her adorable terrier from her ransacked apartment and place it with an even more adorable neighbor kid before proceeding with her getaway. So how bad could she be? Innocent insists her CIA team leader Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber a smug lunkish actor of limited resources). Guilty declares counterintelligence officer Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor who can deliver a convincing vital performance even as a character no one wanted to develop). Fakeouts and red herrings abound before this germ of an idea begins to induce dizziness and lethargy. The movies Big Secret dwindles to BS. It doesnt help that the twiglike Jolie is put in action scenes that would cripple Jason Statham. She yanks a speeding motorcyclist off his bike with a jujitsu wrist lock. She pursues a descending elevator down the shaft by doing a friction slide down parallel girders. She stomps squads of burly assassins into Beefaroni. Im all for equal opportunity for female action heroes (and am especially partial to the dirty charms of Milla Jovovich in the ""Resident Evil"" series). But Jolie who could be the spokesmodel for the pipe cleaner industry is preposterous in these David-and-Goliath smackdowns. Why not give her heat vision and be done with it? SALT  1/2 OUT OF FOUR STARS  Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence. Director Philip Noyce who made the Tom Clancy potboilers ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"" puts us through an ordeal not an adventure. He demonstrates a talent for slickly choreographed turmoil (and a deep-seated hatred for police cars Blammo) but little interest in characterization or emotion. If you like to watch your Oscar winners bounding across speeding trucks on a highway rather than acting look no further. If youre after an engrossing action movie keep looking.

Bailey Columbia Pictures Angelina Jolie plays American CIA agent Evelyn Salt who is forced to defend herself against accusations that she is secretly spying for the Russians. ABOUT THE MOVIESalt  (out of four) Stars Angelina Jolie Liev Schreiber Chiwetel Ejiofor Andre BraugherDirector Phillip Noyce Distributor Sony PicturesRating PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and actionRunning time 1 hour 39 minutesOpens tonight at midnight in some cities and Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY ""I didnt do anything"" mutters Angelina Jolie as the indestructible mysterious CIA operative Salt as she jumps off a bridge onto the roof of a moving car. Though shes defending herself against allegations that shes actually a Russian spy she never stops doing things in this action thriller. The physical stunts just keep on coming. The presence of a female lead thats a butt-kicking mega-mighty fighter is the most noteworthy aspect of this occasionally exciting tale of evil Russians trying to take down America. And in the realm of women stars the statuesque Jolie is just the one to pull off the characters unrelenting physicality. TRAILER Get a taste of Salt As Evelyn Salt shes part James Bond part Mata Hari part generic superhero and part Natasha (Boris counterpart in the animated 1960s series The Rocky andBullwinkle Show). The story has some timely overtones with Russian spy tales recently in the news. But given how long movies take to get made the timeliness is purely coincidental. While the plot is outlandish it unspools with obvious twists and turns. The film has its tense moments but instead of dazzle theres a workmanlike quality to the action sequences. And the dialogue is hampered by a cliched script. ""You are my greatest creation"" crows Russian evildoer Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) to a suspected double agent. Earlier we see him indoctrinating legions of young Russian minions who learn English impeccably enough to attend Princeton though their training consists of predictable classroom sessions and episodes of The Brady Bunch. Meanwhile Salt runs around bouncing off moving cars casually lobbing grenades and generally laying waste to anyone who gets in her way. The considerable talents of a strong supporting cast which includes Chiwetel Ejiofor Liev Schreiber and Andre Braugher go untapped. The only distinguishing feature to this by-the-book thriller is Jolie who gets pummeled as good as she pummels. Director Phillip Noyce doesnt hesitate to show men viciously beating up on her and a climactic mano a mano fight with Schreiber is surprisingly vicious. She nonetheless remains impervious to injury or wear and tear. At one point Jolie dons a furry Russian Cossack-style hat as she confronts her possible comrades. They in contrast are dressed in Western wear. Is that something like wearing a sombrero for a face-off with a Mexican gang? A small dose of Salt goes a long way.

She is being worked over because they suspect she is a spy.""Im not who you think I am"" she insists over and over between the pummels.And as it turns out she is not who we think she is either. Or maybe she is who we think she is The filmmakers want us to believe Jolies Evelyn Salt could be a deep-cover ""sleeper agent"" planted Stateside by the Russians many many years ago - kind of like those folks the FBI just uncovered in North Jersey.But how could Jolie US Weekly icon and Vanity Fair cover girl play a traitor a rogue agent a baddie?The same way Matt Damon plays one in the Bourne pics of course on the run fiercely focused determined to clear his or her name.And like Jason Bourne Salt is CIA. Shes trained in hand-to-hand combat able to hurl herself atop speeding tractor-trailers adept at rappelling down elevator shafts and using office furniture to construct improvised explosive devices.Commendably swift and progressively inane Salt has been directed by Phillip Noyce whose Clear and Present Danger and Patriot Games tossed viewers into a similar world of high-tech intel international intrigue and running around whacking people on the head.Its expeditious stuff From the moment a Russian defector names Salt as the mole Jolie is hoofing it - escaping a secure Washington interrogation facility wreaking havoc on the Beltway revving a (hijacked) motorcycle up the sidewalks collecting sensible shoes from her apartment. And then she exits her building via a neighbors window - floors above the street her fingernails gripping the bricks as she sidles along a slim ledge.Too lean perhaps but nonetheless arresting Jolie jogs jumps kickboxes head-butts hurls grenades and dons disguises as she makes for New York and - alarmingly - a hotel room across the street from a cathedral where funeral services for the vice president are being held. In attendance the presidents of Russia and the United States. The defector had said Salt planned to kill the Russian head of state and seemingly thats what shes here to do.All the while Liev Schreiber as her CIA boss Ted and Chiwetel Ejiofor as the G-man Peabody are trying to chase her down barking stuff like ""Get her records to my handheld"" and ""Theres trouble in the crypt""Needless to say Agent Salt is several steps ahead of them and also ahead of the army of CIA guys Secret Service men and New York cops in her way. She shoots sucker punches smokes and chokes the lot of them - they may as well put up their hands lie down and cry ""Uncle""Salt offers a sloppy concoction of story elements from 70s espionage classics - the sinister black ops of Three Days of the Condor the nuclear dread of Fail-Safe the political-assassination scenarios of The Day of the Jackal. And as in many of the Cold War classics its the Russians who are the villains again.At their smartest spy movies deliver thrills and suspense at the same time they address deeper issues about trust and betrayal identity and deception (and self-identity self-deception). Salt flirts with these notions but with its nonsensical setups and wildly illogical twists (and some crazy Def-Con business in a White House bunker) Jolies action vehicle is just that - an action vehicle moving fast but thinking slow.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Salt amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << Life During Wartime The Other Guys >> Salt In Salt Angelina Jolie is slender muted and awkwardly blonde. Wed swear she was a librarian if at the opening credits we hadnt seen her bloodied cut and capped with a ripe black eye. Now years later shes a government spook one transfer away from a desk job--espionage is a distant second to tucking in a night with her arachnologist husband (August Diehl). But thats not to be. A Russian spy (Daniel Olbrychski) fingers her as a double agent and before you can say ""Hey fellas lets talk this over at the commissary"" Jolie escapes from colleagues Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor leaving behind enough broken bones and busted windows to make the office Christmas party real awkward. Phillip Noyce has made the kind of thriller that skitters after its star playing catch-up. Kurt Wimmers script passes for suspense but robs us of active involvement--the key ingredient in the best action films. Jolie is lean luminous and inscrutable; our eyes track her pleasurably and passively as she gives and takes punches. The filmmakers are under the delusion that this is fascinating enough business that we never want her story to end. And so it doesnt. The road to the video store is paved with aborted franchises. Whatever happened to a film filling its time with awesomeness and taking a bow at the end a blockbuster that wants only to rock your world without presuming a second date?

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Watching Angelina Jolie slice dice kick jump shoot run and blow stuff up all while camera-ready has its moments. The idea of a 110-pound action star with ropy arms Claes Oldenburg lips and a bosom Roger Corman would love made sense only on the pages of a comic book. But Jolie operates in ridiculous defiance of physics. In ""Salt she plays Evelyn Salt an American spy on the run for perhaps being a Russian double agent. At some point it looks as though shes been cornered and caught. But no She leaps off an overpass onto a moving semi then onto a tanker followed by a delivery truck then a motorbike. She hangs off a speeding vehicle forces a poor police officer to drive while she Tases him and goes rolling off a bulleting subway. For 45 minutes as a blonde for 45 as a steely brunette.I started to call a doctor friend to find out how many sequences ago a tag should have graced Evelyns cold lifeless toe. But realizing I was missing the point of the Angelina Jolie experience I put the phone down and considered consulting a personal trainer. I want the Evelyn Salt workout. Otherwise ""Salt is ridiculous. A Russian baddie (Daniel Olbrychski) casually insists during a CIA interrogation that the terrorist scheduled to kill the Russian president at the funeral of the recently deceased American vice president is indeed Agent Salt.That I can believe. What I cant believe is that the North Koreans would have nabbed her in the field as they have in the comical opening scene  or that shed marry a homely German entomologist (August Diehl). Liev Schreiber plays a co-worker and why no one has thought to get these two together until now is mystery. That said only in the latter scenes of Kurt Wimmers screenplay do they really connect in any meaningful way. Otherwise shes Harrison Ford and he and Chiwetel Ejiofor as an FBI agent also trying to catch her share the Tommy Lee Jones part. It takes a lot of men not to catch this woman.So yes the movie is part ""The Fugitive. Its also part ""Bourne Identity and part dutiful airport thriller. To that end the director is Phillip Noyce an Australian who has spent the most lucrative years of his career orchestrating the Hollywood adaptations of such books. ""Patriot Games ""Clear and Present Danger and ""The Bone Collector also with Jolie were professional mostly serious entertainments. ""Salt is a lesser relative.Those first two films along with ""Dead Calm a thriller Noyce made with Nicole Kidman in 1989 exemplified a talent for generating the tension that results in excitement or suspense. Over 20 years later ""Salt appears to have been assembled in the same food processor as most mainstream action films. So much of its fights and chases share a generic sameness both in their sloppy construction and where theyre situated. Take Ye Olde Highway Chase which this movie finds so nice it tries it twice.But Jolie doesnt seem entirely bored with the routine. She has a laugh or two at her bionic image Evelyn is a woman who uses a maxi pad as a bandage and this is a star whos OK spending her movies last quarter looking like Hilary Swank playing Jason Bourne. But at this point Jolies ultraness needs a foil. ""Salt concludes with the promise of a sequel.

Share Tweet On the far fringes of conspiracy-theory enthusiasts lurks a particular subset that even Art Bell used to have a hard time taking seriously those who believe the greatest threat to the United States freedom democracy and all thats good in the world remains the Soviet Union. Salt could have been made specifically for them. Directed by Phillip Noyce from a script by Kurt Wimmer Salt stars Angelina Jolie as a CIA operative whose already-dangerous life takes a peculiar turn when a man claiming to be a Russian defector (Daniel Olbrychski) walks into her office building with a story about a society of genetically selected deep-cover operatives trained from birth by the KGB to plot the overthrow of the United States. The twist of the tale He claims Jolie is one of them. Fearing repercussions of this allegation and seeking to secure her husbands safety Jolie goes on the lam. Or maybe she has other motives for running. Was the Russian telling the truth? For much of its running time Salt effectively though not particularly intelligently teases the audience with slivers of Jolies past. But intelligence isnt really the point. Noyces past excursions into action filmmaking most notably the Harrison Ford-as-Jack Ryan films have been a bit flavorless but here he delivers one from the gut. Borrowing a page from the North By Northwest playbook Salt is essentially one endless chase scene one that doesnt let up and that refreshingly relies far more heavily on real-world stunt work than obvious CGI assistance. Metal twists flames crackle and it all feels disarmingly tangible. (Distinctive work from cinematographer Robert Elswit helps as well.) The story? Well it begins ludicrously then plunges deeper into insanity with each new turn. Jolies commanding presence mostly helps keep laughs at bay--her slightly inhuman glamour works in her favor here--but Salts mechanical command of action is what makes it one of the most entertaining films of a summer thin on its once-abundant variety of cheap thrills. Its old-fashioned over-the-top appeal doesnt end with its hammer-and-sickle bad guys.

"Salt Perfect with popcorn - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Salt Perfect with popcornSalt aaaJuly 22 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticAngelina Jolie stars as ""Evelyn Salt.""Both are worth seeing but ""Salt"" is the opposite of ""Inception."" It isnt trying to reinvent anyones wheel. Its quick (under 90 minutes minus credits) and like the condiment whose name it shares director Phillip Noyces run-like-hell thriller starring Angelina Jolie satisfies a basic human taste -- something to go with the popcorn. I liked it. It knows what its doing. Kurt Wimmers script was initially tailored for someone else. Tom Cruise passed because the role of CIA wizard Edwin Salt hewed too closely to Ethan Hunt of the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise. Edwin became Evelyn Jolie came aboard and the results are a mixture of Cold War-era paranoia and 21st century disinterest in anything like actual spying or counterspying or after a while conversation. The films primary thrust is the sight of Jolie leaping from truck to truck on a freeway or from subway to station stop at high speed or mowing down a surprising number of New Yorks finest as the audience wonders Is this Mata Hari working for us or them or what? Another question Why would anyone not recognize Jolies character in a crowd simply because she has changed the color of her hair? Im sorry but that face is just too distinctively feral yet glamorous to blend in among extras. On the balderdash scale ""Salt"" begins way over on the left establishing its protagonist as a supertough superspook (a North Korea prologue shows her withstanding torture without giving up her identity). Back home in America thanks to her arachnologist husband she and two CIA colleagues are confronted one day with a Russian defector who accuses Salt of being a sleeper agent in the employ of Russians dreaming of old-school world domination. Thus begin the running and the chasing. The action ranges from an assassination attempt on the Russian president in New York City to a threatened nuclear strike on the Middle East. The moment when ""Salt"" slips from very good to pretty good can be pinpointed precisely during a highway chase in which Salt goes from ace survivor to superhuman freak in the time it takes one heroine to survive one too many unsurvivable accidents. Well logic shmogic. Like the ""Bourne"" franchise to which Noyces film is indebted ""Salt"" is a combination of pursuit evasion name-clearing and a reversal or two. Noyce has a refreshing resistance to computer-generated effects so even when the pictures second half settles for bigger and more hyperbolic threats and a steadily mounting body count the freneticism never hits the ""Knight and Day"" level. This director is more old-fashioned. He fared well with ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"" once upon the 90s and here he relies on his very good actors including Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor as U.S. intelligence officers with varying degrees of ambivalence about their own methods to complement Jolie and her homemade bazooka. My two favorite bits are small ones which is why theyre called bits. One It may be in Wimmers script or it may have been cooked up by Noyce and his superlative cinematographer Robert Elswit but when the president calls about his nuclear options the camera dollies in for a close-up of the dreaded red phone. Its a shot to warm the heart of cinematic Cold Warriors everywhere. And two At a state funeral in Manhattan Salt blasts away at the pipe organs (she has her reasons) filling the place with discordant chaos. It recalls the sinister organ-chord resounding through the valley in Alfred Hitchcocks ""Secret Agent"" several movie generations back. The more spy games change the more they stay the same. MPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action) Cast Angelina Jolie (Evelyn Salt); Liev Schreiber (Ted Winter); Chiwetel Ejiofor (Peabody); Daniel Olbrychski (Orlov); August Diehl (Mike Krause) Credits Directed by Phillip Noyce; written by Kurt Wimmer; produced by Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Sunil Perkash.

Salt Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2010) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/salt-2010,200,salt29,salt,rogerebert
"Salt | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; salt ) Salt (United States 2010) July 21 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Salt is more than mere seasoning; its a full bouillabaisse comprised of bits and pieces of James Bond The Manchurian Candidate The Bourne Identity TVs 24 and the Nelson DeMille novel The Charm School. What begins with a delicious appetizer however loses its taste by the arrival of dessert. Salt contains plenty of action; in fact it rarely slows down making one wonder if a better title might be Run Angelina Run. But the plot isnt strong enough to withstand the assault on the wall of suspension of disbelief by a gamut of increasingly preposterous stunts. There comes a point when it becomes difficult to take Salt seriously. That would be fine if this was an intentional parody of action spy thrillers but its not. The films tone argues that it wants to be taken straight and thats where a disconnect occurs. Although the majority of Angelina Jolies recent endeavors have been dramatic in nature shes no stranger to high-wattage action having appeared in the likes of Wanted Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith and a pair of outings as Lara Croft. Shes capable of playing a distaff James Bond (much as her Lara Croft was a softer sexier Indiana Jones). In fact the biggest point of interest in Salt may be the main characters gender How many action films do we see with a female lead? Reportedly Tom Cruise was originally attached to Salt. His removal may have been the best thing for the production and not only because of the actors plunging audience appeal. With Cruise as the star this would have been generic. Jolie adds a different dimension and looks better in heels. Evelyn Salt (Jolie) is one of the CIAs best and brightest. She has given up almost everything for her country. But when a Russian defector Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) fingers her as a KGB agent in deep cover she finds herself being hunted not only by Agent Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a Company Internal Affairs operative but by her partner Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber). According to Orlov Salts objective is to assassinate Russian President Matyveyev (Olek Krupa) who is in the United States attending the funeral of the U.S. Vice President. Sure enough once Salt eludes her pursuers she heads for the cathedral where the funeral is being held but is her goal to fulfill her mission or to find evidence to prove she has been set up? The films mystery element - is Salt a double-agent or a triple-agent? - remains Salts most compelling element. Unfortunately the answer is evident well before the movie reaches its midpoint. From then on the movie falls into the category of pure eye candy although with accomplished director Phillip Noyce at the helm the action scenes are more suspenseful than they might be if choreographed by a less adept filmmaker. They are also coherent eschewing the Paul Greengrass/Bourne approach of shaking the handheld camera so violently its impossible to figure out whats going on. With only a couple of exceptions Salt prefers clear action to the muddied variety. Salt is violent - as violent as a movie can be and still earn the less restrictive PG-13 rating. We are shown brutality torture (of the title character near the beginning when she is held prisoner in North Korea) and death. However since the kills are ""clean"" (no blood) the film manages to sneak in under the PG-13 wire. Unfortunately this is once again an instance in which Hollywood has taken adult material and by toning down graphic elements turned it into teen-friendly fodder. Movies that contain inherently adult content should not be sanitized to the point where they can be shown in the ""no ID required"" wing of the multiplex. This process which is rampant in Hollywood is the reason why fans were so outraged when something similar was done to the Die Hard movies with the fourth installment of the franchise. If the content warrants an R give it an R. The central problem with Salt is that the spy aspects which are by far the most intriguing elements of the movie are shunted aside in favor of spectacular stunts and long chases. Exposition is kept to a minimum because more than a few minutes dialogue kills the pace. Then ending is perfunctory and somewhat unsatisfying because it is obvious and predictable. One gets the sense that the movie represents a solid outline for a mini-series but 95 minutes isnt nearly enough time to explore the possibilities hinted at by the narrative. For example Noyce seems to want the relationship between Evelyn and her husband Mike (August Diehl) to have real resonance but too little of it remains in the final cut for it to come across as more than a necessary afterthought. Somewhere in Salts DNA is a Machiavellian scheme that is bludgeoned into submission by the need to please an ADD crowd. Admittedly Salt goes well with popcorn but its never filling.

When a critic or an audience complained that a plot twist was too luridly far-fetched to believe that it stretched and snapped the bonds of reality (a rather vague concept to be sure) that would generally go down as a negative assessment. Over the past couple of decades though expectations have shifted. Fantasy has leaked like an oil spill into everything even naturalistic thrillers and that has changed our relationship to them. Salt a jacked-up espionage/action machine starring Angelina Jolie as a CIA superstar who may or may not be a Russian mole is a movie I have no trouble calling flagrantly preposterous and over-the-top -- impossible to buy on any sober adult level. Its like a John le Carre double-agent yarn compacted into comic-book pulp as if by the makers of Con Air. Yet the movie doesnt pretend to be anything other than that; to call it out for being ludicrous would be like complaining that Superman flies. Besides Salt knows how to stay one step ahead of you in devious if jaw-droppingly contrived ways. The movie is fun dammit. So who cares really if its trash? The opening half hour fakes us out a bit because its designed to recall the Bourne films which in their intricate Hitchcockian whiplash-camera paranoia are plausible (by the skin of their teeth). A prelude sequence with Jolies Evelyn Salt stripped down to her bra and panties bloodied and writhing in a North Korean torture den establishes that the director Phillip Noyce (Clear and Present Danger) isnt above using cheap exploitation tricks with a wink to hook us. The film then leaps ahead two years when a Russian defector named Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) wanders into Langley and makes the following statement that the Russians going back to the days of Lee Harvey Oswald have created an underground army of sleeper agents and assassins recruited and programmed from childhood to infiltrate America. All of them are waiting to strike when the order comes. He then announces that Salt the agent whos interrogating him is one of those secret Russian operatives. The premise of Salt may be hokum but it cleverly braids together old Cold War tensions with new fears of al-Qaeda topping it off with touches from The Manchurian Candidate and Children of the Damned. For all that the picture wastes no time spinning into high-velocity lone-wolf action mode as Salt accused of treason rushes to escape her CIA colleagues including the trusting sympathetic Winter (Liev Schreiber making bureaucratic bluster sexy) and the skeptical by-the-book Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor). We assume initially that she cant be guilty of what shes been accused of. But then why is she acting guilty? We certainly know why she scurries around barefoot using her lace underwear to cover a surveillance camera or a maxi pad to bandage a wound. Salt is like Bourne or Bond recast as a feminist pinup. On the run she builds a rocket launcher out of a swivel chair and a fire extinguisher. During a highway chase she leaps from one speeding truck to the next and she charges into rooms and mows down row upon row of assailants using fists feet and guns. As the camera swoops directly over her she hangs from a ledge of the apartment building where she lives with her kindly German-national spider-researcher husband (August Diehl) whom she fell in love with when she was busy recruiting him for the CIA. Jolie executes all of this with a terse nearly android-like efficiency. She still retains a hint of sensuality in those satin-pillow lips only now that famous feature is set off by a body so uncurvaceously skinny that her entire physique seems to have been stripped down for action. There are no shadings to Angelina Jolie in Salt; shes all sinew and will. In that sense though shes the very model of a modern kinetic movie star. If Salt were nothing but chase sequences it might grow tedious but Noyce working from a script by Kurt Wimmer (who co-wrote the elegant remake of The Thomas Crown Affair) builds nuts-and-bolts suspense into the question of who Salt is which side shes on -- and why the Russians in one very crafty and elaborate set piece would even attempt to assassinate their own president. Salt has enough high-octane reversals to keep you guessing right to the end. Even if you dont entirely buy any of them.

Salt Bad to fair Director Phillip Noyce. Cast Angelina Jolie Liev Schreiber Chiwetel Ejiofor. Rating Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and action. Related stories Spotlight Angelina Jolie Thrilling spy movies Angelina Jolie rough in Salt Granted ""Salt"" starring Angelina Jolie isnt supposed to be a documentary about national security. But couldnt they at least make it a little bit realistic? No. Instead a massive manhunt involving a beautiful spy continually leads nowhere even to the point where White House security . . . oh never mind. Saying more would reveal too much. Suffice it to say that its something that would make Austin Powers blush baby but its not supposed to be funny. I dont think so anyway. Its certainly possible that director Phillip Noyce whose cold-warrior status was honed in such 90s films as ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger"" is showing a sense of humor when he sends his action heroine hurtling from the top of one speeding truck to another on a busy freeway. That or an ignorance of the laws of physics. But for the most part he seems to take things pretty seriously. That tone is established from the start when we see Evelyn Salt in a cell in North Korea stripped down to her underwear and beaten brutally by her captors who insist shes a spy. Clever fellows. She denies it though until her release by way of exchange with another prisoner which was somehow arranged by her future husband an arachnologist named Mike (August Diehl). Fast-forward two years and theyre happily married him studying spiders while she continues with her clandestine work. Then a Russian defector walks into the CIA office and says he knows of a plan hatched in the Soviet Union years ago in which children were trained to be good little Americans a nest of sleeper cells in the making; eventually they will rise up and destroy the U.S. And Salt is one of them. She denies it - and fearing for her husbands safety promptly flees in a violent escape that involves both covering a security camera with her panties and concocting a sort of cannon out of what appear to be cleaning supplies and a fire extinguisher to the consternation of her boss Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber). Counterintelligence officer Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) has seen enough. Bring her in or take her down is the protocol but neither proves easy. Noyces aim here as he works from a script by Kurt Wimmer is to keep the audience guessing as to Salts true identity. And he does a pretty good job of it as Salt seemingly confirms Peabodys suspicions even as he begins to doubt them himself. Jolie is good at this kind of thing. The slightly crazy vibe she gives off in tabloid stories about her life and marriage serves her well when shes playing a cold-blooded killer good or bad. Its not exactly news that she is beautiful but shes also magnetic a genuine movie star. Tom Cruise was originally going to play the role; she does dangerously homicidal better. Schreiber and Ejiofor are outstanding talents but they dont get much chance to show it here. Mostly Salt flees and they chase. A few plot twists a couple of ludicrous set pieces and were all set for a sequel. As the final scene plays out (sort of) theres no guessing about that.

Bailey A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Salt famously the Spy Flick Rewritten for Angelina Jolie After Tom Cruise Dropped Out has been publicized as the cinematic equivalent of the 19th Amendment finally a level playing field for female action stars This is mostly bullshit of course--Jolies Evelyn Salt is not the first action hero to be given a gender reassignment between initial conception and opening weekend (cough Alien) nor is this the first stunt-heavy film Jolie has carried on her back and sold on her name. What is startling about Salt is the extent to which in insisting on the moral ambiguity of its protagonist for most of its running time it gives us an action-hero prototype that Cruise couldnt play and Jolie was born to.Ambiguity itself is something Cruise just doesnt do--maybe thats why for 30 years haters/fans have devoted so much energy to speculating about his supposed secret sex life. But Jolie is all about ambiguity and always has been. Shes an Oscar winner and an action star a husband-stealing tattooed pin-up and an orphan-adopting mom of six. In the first scene of Salt she is tortured by North Korean prison guards while wearing a bra and panties her long blond locks stained with blood like a vixen from an exploitation flick. From the start this character plays to the stars strengths merging subject and object warrior and victim ass-kicker and damsel-in-distress.And hero and villain. A trusted member of a CIA team led by Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) Salt is outed as a Russian double agent by Orlov (Daniel Olbrychski) her supposed comrade who essentially just strolls into a covert CIA outpost and accuses her of treason. Salts colleagues taking Orlov at his word slip into 70s-film paranoia mode and initiate an all-hands manhunt; Salt runs managing to stay a step ahead of the feds and several steps ahead of the audience all the while laying waste to dozens on either side of the apparent with-us/against-us divide.Coded by that first virtuous victim scene as the good guy early on Salt starts acting like a bad guy and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer and director Phillip Noyce are in no hurry to clear up the matter of their ostensible protagonists true allegiance. Eschewing any of the usual tricks and winks to let us know we can trust her that her moral compass renders her many crimes as collateral damage in the interest of the greater good the filmmakers imbue what at first seem to be rote action devices with unexpected psychological gravitas. Not until the final scene does Salt unambiguously spell out how were meant to feel about all thats come before. Compared to a film like Inception which is forever stopping to explain to us what weve just seen this feels like an incredible show of restraint.If Jolies star persona has something to do with Salts muddling of moral binaries her gender inspires little in the way of action-hero subversion. Her physical disadvantage as a smaller human being is ignored--in fact when it comes to hand-to-hand combat she seems to be the only fighter on either side who fully knows what shes doing. And the filmmakers are not above condescendingly winking at the notion of feminine wiles. When she needs to hide from a security camera she removes her panties and tosses them over the lens; when she needs to improvise a weapon she concocts an explosive out of everyday items any gal might find in her cleaning pantry and medicine cabinet. She may be invincible but her number-one ace in the hole seems to be that she can always convince smitten men they can fuck her.So lets not give this gambit more credit than it deserves--Salt is not particularly politically or socially progressive; stylistically the best that can be said is that Noyce elegantly mashes up post-Bourne shaky-cam p.o.v. with gilded bombast straight out of his own 90s Jack Ryan films. Its conception of world affairs would seem hopelessly retrograde if the U.S. hadnt hauled in a sleeper cell of Russian spies like last week. That this is a would-be franchise-launcher becomes clear when the first end title card interrupts Jolie mid-dash to what we presume would have been the final action set piece; its only at that moment that we understand weve been watching an origin story a primer on who this antihero is and how she came to be the only thing standing in the way of the nuclear annihilation of Mecca (yes seriously). That it flatters the audience by assuming a modicum of intelligence earns points if were grading on a curve but this is still closer to product than art. Highly satisfying often exhilarating refreshingly unpretentious product.

Her loyalty will be tested when a defector accuses her of being a Russian spy. (Columbia Pictures) Joe Neumaier Tuesday July 20 2010 400 AM Title Salt Forget Anna Chapman and New Yorks Russian Connection - its Angelina Jolie and ""Salt"" that make the Cold War cool again.This old-fashioned spy actioner opening Friday is fast-moving exciting and contains more twists than a tunnel under Checkpoint Charlie.It nods to classic suspense flicks - ""The Manchurian Candidate"" ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"" ""Three Days of the Condor"" - without seeming dated. And it has a star doing what she does best Giving a chilly character a cache of secret vulnerability.Jolies Evelyn Salt is a U.S. spook first seen being tortured by North Koreans for stealing nuclear secrets. Two years later having been saved in a spy swap shes married and working as a CIA analyst in Washington when a mysterious Russian defector names her as a double-agent.He claims she was trained along with a generation of Red orphans in the 70s to be a super-sleeper spy wholl start an attack on America planned by Soviet leaders decades ago.Salt insists shes innocent but goes on the run to keep a visiting diplomat from being assassinated in New York and her own husband from being a pawn.Only her CIA boss (a perfectly sneaky Liev Schreiber) stands between Salt and the counterintelligence officer (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who wants to haul her in or kill her before the fail-safe stakes get too high.Theres enough preposterousness in ""Salt"" to set off a Geiger counter - including a death by shoe-stiletto a fire extinguisher-turned-rocket launcher and activated nuke codes - but director Philip Noyce (""Patriot Games"" ""Clear and Present Danger"") working from a taut script by Kurt Wimmer makes the retro thrills feel new.Its nutty premise of Kremlin kids-as-boogeymen moles is winkingly old school just like the nuts-and-bolts action style This is a summer blockbuster that highlights leaps from a truck instead of giant fireballs and excessive CG fakery.And Jolie despite all the Mata Hari trappings mostly avoids playing things bigger than life.Running through the streets dwarfed by a giant backpack she looks frail and tiny and it helps humanize her. That is until she cold-bloodedly kills people who were her allies a few plot twists earlier.Then like everyone else in this trim cloak-and-dagger thriller youll wonder what really makes her tick.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Not every movie can survive protagonist gender reassignment but credit the makers of ""Salt"" for shrewdly retooling this onetime Tom Cruise starrer as a vehicle for Angelina Jolie. As a fierce superspy and mistress of many disguises Jolie reps the one indisputably kickass element in this brisk professionally assembled but finally shrug-inducing thriller which sees director Phillip Noyce applying his action chops to a predictable slice of warmed-over Cold War paranoia (recent headlines notwithstanding). One of the more anticipated entries of a blah summer Sony release looks to extend Jolies streak as one of the few consistently bankable action stars male or female working today. Originally titled ""Edwin A. Salt"" scribe Kurt Wimmers present-day scenario -- predicated on the threat of Russian sleeper spies waiting to trigger a massive attack on the U.S. -- drew attention from Cruise and other potential male leads before capturing Jolies interest. In short order Edwin became Evelyn a transformation that required an apparently none-too-difficult rewrite given the characters deliberately hazy inner life and preference for action over words. Certainly the filmmakers havent allowed anything resembling chivalry to distract from the matter at hand as Jolies Salt finds herself tortured punched shot nearly gassed and forced to leap from one speeding semi to another on a busy highway -- and thats just the first hour. The brutality begins immediately with blonde CIA agent Evelyn Salt on the receiving end of a bloody interrogation by North Korean captors before being sprung at great cost by one Mike Krause (August Diehl). Two years later the two are living in Washington D.C. as happily married as a hunky arachnologist and a smooth undercover operative can be. But everything changes during a seemingly routine interview between Salt and a Russian defector Orlov (an excellent Daniel Olbrychski). In an expository sequence whose use of flashbacks and slow-build pacing are a refreshing indicator of a meticulous storyteller behind the camera (even if the story itself happens to be ludicrous) Orlov explains the presence of a hidden network of childhood-indoctrinated spies for the Motherland and then unexpectedly fingers Salt as one of them. A whirlwind of violence ensues as Salt denies the accusation but seemingly confirms her guilt fleeing her CIA colleagues -- led by close associate Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) -- as she searches for her now-missing husband. But once shes broken free of her pursuers Salt goes on the offensive her vaguely ominous motives now signaled by a goth-black dye job and heads to New York where the Russian president (Olek Krupa) is scheduled to make a public appearance. As a sexy killing machine whose true identity and intentions are intended to remain a mystery to the audience Salt is clearly (if somewhat wishfully) being positioned as a curvier alternative to Jason Bourne. But in its efforts to spark fresh dramatic fireworks from the ashes of a past political conflict (despite an obligatory shout-out to the Middle East) ""Salt"" often plays like a throwback to such 90s thrillers as Noyces own Tom Clancy adaptations ""Patriot Games"" and ""Clear and Present Danger."" Multiple presidential assassination attempts and a doomsday missile-launch crisis hardly dispel the overall moribund feel of the material; neither does a third-act twist that wont come as a surprise to anyone whos been paying even moderate attention. Where the films old-school quality pays off however is in the fight sequences; if weve seen the stairwell attacks slo-mo machine gunnings and rush-hour getaways many times before theyre at least presented with coherence and crackle and with little in the way of high-tech gadgetry (at one point Salt builds a weapon out of a wastebasket and a fire extinguisher). Having spent most of the past decade helming politically charged prestige fare (""Catch a Fire"" ""Rabbit-Proof Fence"" ""The Quiet American"") Noyce rolls up his sleeves and delivers an unpretentious piece of action-movie craftsmanship that proves worthy of its stars own consummate professionalism. No less than in ""Wanted"" ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" and the ""Tomb Raider"" movies Jolie is very much in her element submitting gamely to the mayhem and hitting crucial emotional notes with effective understatement. But the pic tries to make Salts identity more compelling a puzzle than it really is; her allegiances are never really in doubt further leaching suspense and interest from the setup. Salts apparent willingness to relinquish all ties for her husbands safety may not sit well with those who like their butt-kicking feminist role models devoid of romantic feelings (even when theyre portrayed as subtly as they are here). As though aware of these concerns the filmmakers have taken care to make the character more and more ruthless as the film progresses. This makes for some nifty sequences as Salt descends with almost wraithlike intensity upon her attackers but unlike the Bourne movies ""Salt"" never manages to turn its death-defying stunts into character insights never reveals psychology through action. Schreiber gets to show off some fighting moves of his own while the usually welcome Chiwetel Ejiofor is trapped in the role of a by-the-book CIA scold. Costume designer Sarah Edwards deserves special mention for Jolies many disguises one of which a Russian military uniform is deployed with particular wit. Other tech credits from James Newton Howards score to Robert Elswits widescreen lensing of Gotham and D.C. locations are topnotch.

TWITTER Angelina Jolie for all intents and purposes is James Bond in her new film ""Salt"" and its really no surprise that Jolie the only female action star in Hollywood more than measures up to Daniel Craig. She never quite says ""The name is Salt. Evelyn Salt."" But Angelina Jolie for all intents and purposes is James Bond in her new film ""Salt"" and its really no surprise that Jolie the only female action star in Hollywood more than measures up to Daniel Craig. Donning several guises while on the run in Columbias spy thriller she even -- with the help of considerable facial latex mind you -- turns up as a guy in one scene. She makes a pretty ugly one but it makes an amusing gag a kind of acknowledgment that kick-ass action heroes now come in both genders. In Jolies case its more convincing than ever because in those Lara Croft movies she looked like an animated creature that popped out of a video game. While preposterous at every turn ""Salt"" is a better Bond movie than most recent Bond movies as its makers keep the stunts real and severely limit CGI gimmickry. This is a slick light summer entertainment that should throw considerable coin into Sonys coffers while re-establishing (if it needs re-establishing) Jolies bona fides as an action star. The film certainly didnt need the assist but recent news events have erased any objection from critics tied to laws of plausibility over the films key concept that Russian sleeper spies still exist in the U.S. long after the fall of the Soviet Union. Another talking point here is the similarity between this film reportedly first developed for Tom Cruise and the action-spy thriller he chose to do the lamentable ""Knight and Day."" There are astonishing similarities An American spy believed to be a rogue agent gets chased by the CIA with the protagonist escaping by among other tricks leaping from one fast-moving vehicle to another on a major thoroughfare. These similarities only point up how smart ""Salt"" is in crafting its escapist fare. Director Phillip Noyce and stunt guru Simon Crane working from a clever though shallow screenplay by Kurt Wimmer make sure the stunts in ""Salt"" look like a dangerous and demanding day at the office. In ""Knight and Day"" the movies absurd physicality is played as effortless clowning replete with repartee that is supposed to remind you of 007 but in fact is embarrassingly flat and banal. Theres no joking around here. Jolies Evelyn Salt is made of sterner stuff the kind that can survive a North Korean prison without giving up the name of her employer the CIA. Back in D.C. and married to a nice though naive German arachnologist (August Diehl) -- yes he studies spiders and yes there is a payoff to that -- she is assigned to CIA desk duties when a supposed Russian defector (Daniel Olbrychski) walks in one day. Nobody is particularly buying his act especially Salts superior Ted Winter (Liev Schreiber) but she accedes to his plea to interrogate the man briefly before she heads home to an anniversary dinner. The Russian talks nonsense about sleeper cells and a plot to assassinate the Russian president on American soil. Then he happens to drop the name of the Russian sleeper spy Evelyn Salt. This apparently is enough to turn the Agencys counterintelligence officer Peabody (Chiwetel Ejiofor) into her instant foe. Nothing that happens after this deserves any serious scrutiny but its fun to watch Jolies Salt seemingly transforms into the Russian sleeper agent she is reputed to be -- escaping from a virtual lockdown dodging cars and bullets making her way to New York and through subway tunnels to confront the Russian president then take on seemingly every Russian and CIA op in her way. All those ""seemingly"" qualifiers are meant to indicate that no studio is going to cast Jolie as a villain or even an anti-hero. What do you think this is the 70s? But theres just enough doubt for the ad copy to read Who is Salt? You cant say the movie keeps you guessing about this for long since most attentive viewers will figure out the true villain(s) well before the climax. But the chase is the whole point. Here Noyce and his team excel. Propelled by James Newton Howards nerve-teasing music and enhanced by Robert Elswits clear-eyed smartly positioned cameras ""Salt"" moves ever forward -- pushing pushing pushing its heroine to greater feats every minute. It doesnt stop for martinis either shaken or stirred or any other detours. The movie is lean and muscular looking for action even in situations where a little sleight of hand might have done the trick. You do wish that maybe it did slow down to consider the human factor. Salt is married; lets dig into that. A marriage between an agent and a civilian is never explored. In making the husband a problem that needs solving here -- not to give anything away -- the movie stumbles badly. At the end of the day ""who is Salt"" is less a tagline than a criticism. Eventually you know what Salt is. But who she is isnt satisfactorily resolved. In story terms that is. In Hollywood terms theres never any doubt Salt is Angelina Jolie.
