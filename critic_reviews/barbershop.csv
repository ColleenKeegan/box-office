The unisex barbershop of the title is a pillar of its south-side neighborhood yet owner Ice Cube must contend with gun violence on the streets and fears that his son is being courted by a local street gang. Without shying away from complexity director Malcolm D. Lee (The Best Man Holiday) shows how strong fatherhood and civic activism can engender social progress. And as always the barbers and their regulars debate race gender and sexuality their spirited rap sessions smart and nuanced. With Regina Hall Cedric the Entertainer Anthony Anderson Eve and Common.

Movie Review New Barbershop gets political Arriving 14 years after the original ""Barbershop"" and 12 after ""Barbershop 2 Back in Business"" ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" is saddled with the task of taking a familiar property and bringing it up to date. Comment By Katie WalshTribune News Service Posted Apr. 14 2016  930 pm Arriving 14 years after the original ""Barbershop"" and 12 after ""Barbershop 2 Back in Business"" ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" is saddled with the task of taking a familiar property and bringing it up to date. In the hands of writers Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver and director Malcom D. Lee the strategy is to get political with the issue of shootings and gang violence in Chicago as the galvanizing force around which the barbershop rallies. Leaving aside the humorous cultural escapism of the early aughts ""The Next Cut"" faces the racial and political issues of 2016 head on.Ice Cube returns as Calvin a successful small business owner married with a teen son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.) just trying to keep the wild bunch at the barbershop in check. With the exception of Terri (Eve) and Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) its a whole new crew in the shop including Calvins best friend Rashad (Common) nerdy cute Jerrod (Lamorne Morris) ""Bollyhood"" barber Raja (Utkarsh Ambudkar) as well as entrepreneurial One Stop (J.B. Smoove) and uncensored Dante (Deon Cole).On the other side of the shop is a ladies salon managed by Angie (Regina Hall) featuring outlandishly dressed flirt Draya (Nicki Minaj) and the soulfully conscious Bree (Margot Bingham). The girls vs. boys layout allows for heated debates and banter covering everything from gender to presidential politics.The barbershop in this film is a hub of the community where issues of all types are hashed out. Right away that issue becomes gang violence and shootings in their community. Calvins concerned about his son and considers moving the business to the North Side. But with the threat of an ominous ""enclosure"" to stem the violence soon to be voted on by city council and an increase in tensions the crew decides to take it upon themselves to promote a 48-hour cease-fire with free haircuts for the duration hoping to inspire peace talks and community bonding.Theres a lot of rhetoric about ""taking care of your own business"" saving your own community and placing the power on the individual to affect change. The neo-liberal ideas are espoused most vehemently by Raja the son of Indian immigrants who chased the American Dream -- though the lively debaters in the shop are quick to point out that the playing field isnt level for African-Americans.Less successful is the subplot about infidelity suspicions between Terry Rashad and Draya. The quickly escalating drama and cheesy reconciliations arent as interesting as the spirited discussions about relationships on the floor of the shop and feel shoehorned in to give Eve and Common something to do. The relationship that feels the most fresh funny and contemporary is between dorky Jerrod and enlightened Bree. Lamorne Morris as Jerrod is the low-key MVP of the film a comedic standout.The cease-fire seems strangely ineffective a short term solution that doesnt effect real change. But ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" stays on message about community pride family values and personal responsibility. Its a wholesomely entertaining film though some of the political discourse is a bit fast and loose with neo-liberal notions of individualism and respectability politics (Ice Cube of all people admonishes his son about baggy pants) and wants to be simultaneously both pro- and anti-government. Its a mixed message but that perfectly encapsulates the confusion of 2016 American politics.""Barbershop The Next Cut""Starring Ice Cube Eve Common Nicki Minaj Cedric the Entertainer Regina Hall Lamorne MorrisRating PG-13 for sexual material and languageRunning time 149 Terms of Service top clicks POPULAR EMAILED COMMENTED Mark Patinkin Providence Mayor Elorza can you spare us from the panhandling?

Pictures Calvins is a place where we can all laugh together sometimes at ideas that veer close to being explosive Today theres no place either in real life or on social media where you can talk about anything under the sun--race politics sex religion pop culture--and not get yourself into trouble. Thats what makes Malcolm D. Lees Barbershop The Next Cut so freeing and such a pleasure. The pacing is noodly--youd never look at this movie as a model of perfect structure--and the plot mechanics sometimes creak. But like the movies that preceded it the ebullient Barbershop (2002) and its rather clumsy follow-up Barbershop 2 Back in Business (2004) The Next Cut is less about plot than about communication and conversation offering a sense of promise that the air can be cleared if we just talk to each other. Its also filled with life If the characters in The Next Cut most of whom are African American struggle with racial politics and socioeconomic pressures--not to mention the terrible reality that their friends and family are in constant danger of being killed either by one of their own or by a cop--they also wrestle with the regular day-to-day stuff. A strained marriage might open the door to an affair. A good kid might be unduly influenced by a ""bad"" one. A single woman is having a devil of a time finding a good man. The Next Cut wrangles with all of it not so much looking for the answers as opening cracks of light from which answers might emerge. Its also incidentally likely to make you laugh. Ice Cube returns as Calvin the proprietor of a barbershop on Chicagos South Side--he inherited the place from his father and its always been a spot where the locals could gather and gossip. Nearly all of the cast members from the first two movies have returned including Cedric the Entertainers snoozy elderly barber Eddie a mumbling (and generally hilarious) one-man Greek chorus and Deon Coles Dante a customer who has pretty much moved into the joint. (At one point he mounts a lonely and ill-advised but very funny defense of R. Kelly.) But the shops location rife with gang violence has become more dangerous than ever and he fears for the well-being of his teenage son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr). Should he move his establishment to another part of town? Despite the troubles business is booming. Calvin has teamed up with beauty-shop proprietor Angie (Regina Hall) to cut costs and increase traffic. But the presence of so many women in this once mostly male enclave has created a few problems Unapologetically bodacious hairstylist Draya (Nicki Minaj saucy and delightful with a voice the texture of Pop Rocks) has her eye on one particular barber on the other side of the shop Commons Rashad. Rashads wife Terri (Eve)--long the shops only woman barber--is having none of it. Sexual tension isnt the only thing crackling. Calvins shop is a place where people drop in and talk about everything neighborhood shootings (there are a few tense moments when rivals find themselves in the shop at the same time--Lee infuses these exchanges with genuine menace); city-planning ""improvements"" that are actually the opposite; the reality that when youre black working hard isnt always going to afford the life you want for yourself or your children. Director Lee is incidentally the cousin of Spike who late last year released his own movie about (among other things) violence in modern Chicago the glorious Chi-Raq. Malcolm D. Lees approach is looser and more casual but its potent in its own way. Hes also the director of the 1999 Best Man and the 2013 Best Man Holiday pictures that might be considered by marketing types to be ""for"" audiences of color. But theyre really for everybody Part comedy part soap opera they wrap almost everything in life--love sex money jealousy interracial romance mortal illness childbirth--in their mighty embrace. Barbershop The Next Cut is for everybody too and not just because we all need to think about race in this country--the ways in which it divides us and the ways in which it shouldnt. This Barbershop is simply a place where we can all laugh together sometimes at ideas that veer close to being explosive. At one point the shops only South Asian barber Raja (Utkarsh Ambudkar) uses the term ""non-negro"" in a fairly benign context and catches himself. ""Can I say that?"" he asks facing the others sudden silence. Cedrics Eddie speaks up ""Say it slow so we can hear all the syllables."" The tension breaks and the air becomes clear again--maybe because in order to laugh you need to be able to breathe first. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Not exactly about the haircuts this 12-years-down-the-road sequel in the likable Barbershop franchise is still very much about getting ones head straight avoiding the temptations of coworkers (like a much-ogled Nicki Minaj) or--more seriously--the lures of gang acceptance that ruin the young and impressionable. Its a fairly strident comedy one that sometimes feels like an Afterschool Special with a timely real-life link to the escalating murder rate plaguing Chicagos South Side. Fierce righteousness is well-suited to series anchor Ice Cube who as the salons decent proprietor Calvin gives his most substantial performance since Boyz n the Hood. Hes got many rousing stand-up-and-cheer monologues including an argument with his wayward teenage son that champions the virtues of being smart and carefully choosing your associates. Provocatively director Malcolm D. Lee echoes some of the grammar of Spike Lees movies--not only his recent similarly themed Chi-Raq but Do the Right Thing in shots that pin the besieged Calvin in a cloud of worry much like Sal in his pizzeria. Its refreshing to encounter a sequel that leans deeper into sociopolitical realities not further away. While The Next Cut doesnt take any jabs at mayor Rahm Emanuel (who deserves them) theyre implied by the films plot about a small business organizing a weekend ceasefire when local authorities prove ineffective. Still the movies tone wobbles between sincerity sitcom-style naughtiness and stand-up gags courtesy Cedric the Entertainer and a large well-defined cast. It all feels a touch schematic trying to satisfy every audience type when each haircut should be different. Barbershop The Next Cut actually ends up in the chair with a highly symbolic snipping that could have come straight outta the 1950s.

Its not a subject for laughs. But Barbershop The Next Cut the third in a comedy franchise that first opened its doors in 2002 refuses to ignore what going on outside its windows on the citys raging South Side. More News Ice Cube Has More Words for Gene Simmons on Rock Hall Ice Cube Donald Trump Is What Americans Love Ice Cube Common Cut Their Hair Beef in Real People Video All Stories >> Ice Cube roiling inside like a gathering storm is back as Calvin Palmer. Calvin owns the place with Angie (Regina King) whose team of bodacious beauticians shares the premises much to the annoyance of Eddie the veteran scissorhands played to the hilt and beyond by Cedric the Entertainer. Dont get me wrong the fun is still rough and rowdy and everyone gets up in it. The gender warfare in the shop gives a satirical hosing to everyone from R. Kelly to Obama (""Barack has definitely got bitches""). As ever the Barbershop franchise lets in fresh players here including Utkarsh Ambudkar as a barber from India who votes Republican Lamorne Morris as a geek that everyone including his dream girl (Margot Bingham wonderful) takes for gay and a knockout Nicki Minaj (booty note to the Kardashians she twerks with everything shes got) as a siren stylist who comes between a barber (Common terrific) and his wife (Eve). But these subplots take a backseat to what really matters. Calvin is worried that his teenage son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.) is getting recruited by gangbangers. He thinks of selling the shop and hightailing off to the safer North Side. But first a plan is hatched use social media to offer free haircuts during a weekend-long ceasefire that will return the barbershop to a no-kill zone where people can talk shit in peace. Sure its a reach. But new screenwriters Kenya Barris (Black-ish) and Tracy Oliver make a deft go of it. And director Malcolm D. Lee of the Best Man films marshals his troops with commendable skill. The directors cousin  Spike Lee juggled a similar hot potato with more ambition in last years Chi-raq. But the direct approach taken here pays major dividends. Barbershop The Next Cut is stagey often simplistic and it talks too damn much. But hell the talk has flavor and snap and a real-world sense of a community in crisis. Not bad for an escapist romp.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 15 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 15 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Malcolm D. Lee Written by Kenya Barris Tracy Oliver Starring Ice Cube Cedric the Entertainer Nicki Minaj Classification 14A Country USA Language English Shameless in its shout-outs to Chicago but commendable for its addressing of gender race and urban-violence issues Barbershop The Next Cut will do fine box office and trigger funny-punny press quotes - a cut above a shear delight etc. But while the film is well meaning and the joshing crew at Calvins Barbershop is a hoot the Malcolm D. Lee-directed comedy is plagued by relentless mawkishness indifferent storytelling willful naivete and clunky seriousness. Twelve years after Barbershop 2 Ice Cube is back as the sensible Calvin who now shares his establishment with a female co-owner. That the shop is co-ed and half-salon breathes new life into the comedy franchise and rapper Nicki Minajs character is cartoonishly amusing. But fellow hip-hop star Common is as oaken an actor as youll ever see and a central plot that suggests a weekend of free weaves and trims will help solve South Side gang violence cant really be serious. Next time? Just a little off the top please and leave the socio-political commentary to others.

Pictures)A message movie with a capital M ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" couldnt be much more on-the-nose if it was a two-hour public service announcement.Its lesson is built around the gang violence that is ripping apart Chicagos South Side which provides the backdrop for this third trip to Ice Cubes barber chair 12 years after the last visit.The story picks up with Calvin (Cube) trying to keep his 14-year-old son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.) out of the Vice Lords one of the gangs at the center of the Chicago violence.This being ""Barbershop"" most of the action takes place in the shop where there is plenty of riffing on pop culture hip-hop race relations and neighborhood issues from the prospective of the shops staff (including Cedric the Entertainers Eddie Commons Rashad Nicki Minajs Draya J.B. Smooves One-Stop and Eves Terri) and its clients (Deon Coles Dante can never seem to leave the shop).These conversations and light chit-chat are the tapestry upon which the ""Barbershop"" franchise is built and underscore the role of the barbershop in the community.Yet as the gang plot takes over -- the barbershop offers a ceasefire to the warring gangs to help increase the peace -- the film becomes a series of speeches about how gang violence is bad.Which it is of course but ""Barbershop"" makes its point so bluntly that the fun banter becomes a heavy-handed lesson.Still the cast has a natural chemistry and the shop has an authentic feel. Even as things get preachy the quips keep customers coming through the door.agrahamdetroitnews.com(313) 222-2284twitter.com/grahamoramaBarbershop The Next CutGRADE B-Rated PG-13 for sexual material and languageRunning time 112 minutes 32 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1SdIxz0 MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/04/14/movie-review-barbershop-abuzz-gang-violence-message/83059888/,200,barbershop6,barbershop,detroitnews

Yep Ice Cube is back as the beloved Chi-town barber in Barbershop The Next Cut a new installment in the always welcome heartwarming comedy series that balances derriere jokes sight gags music and dancing with a socially conscious - and outspokenly liberal - message about the joys and challenges of life in African American communities. Confined for the most part to a single set and composed of simple plot lines the Barbershop films succeed with solid characters and snappy clever dialogue along with heartfelt sentiment. Last and certainly not least theres the sin factor. The films feature some of showbizs hottest stars draped in fetching and/or criminally skimpy outfits while engaged in suggestive dialogue and situations. The Barbershop movies live and die by their terrific ensemble casts. The Next Cut features returning stars Eve Sean Patrick Thomas Troy Garity and Cedric the Entertainer who is electric as the crotchety elder statesman Eddie. Newcomers include Regina Hall as Calvins new business partner Common as his best friend and Eves new husband and Nicki Minaj as the woman who tries to bed him - an aggressive husband-stealing stylist whose opinions about sexual politics are as in-your-face as her bionic decolletage. They congregate at the barbershop where they discuss their personal problems or argue about the state of the Chicago Bulls the state of gender roles in African American families or the state of Illinois. Recipes are traded along with morsels of wisdom about health care and bon mots about the best sexual positions. A heated fight over the economy morphs into an even angrier confrontation about the efforts of Americas first black president to ameliorate the legacy of slavery in America. The Next Cut focuses most of its attention on the devastating effects of gang violence on the South Side an issue that directly affects Calvin and his BFF Rashad both of whom are raising teenage sons. How can ordinary people make a difference asks Calvin when politicians and business leaders have been powerless to fix things? Calvin and his pals have a sit-down with the leaders of the South Sides two biggest gangs to ask for a 48-hour cease-fire. It works It seems Marquis (Notorious Jamal Woolard) and Jay (Renell Gibbs) who are easily the two most dangerous thugs around love their barber so much that they agree to play nice for a weekend. In exchange the shop offers free haircuts to all comers. (Yes the Barbershop franchise seriously simplifies the issues but it remains one of very few pop-culture venues outside of rap music where these problems are discussed.) Word gets out and Calvins experiment attracts TV reporters and local celebs. There are smiles there are tears theres good will. But behind the scenes theres evil The gangs continue an aggressive recruitment drive aimed at Calvins son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.). So there also are a few shudders. The weight of the pictures moral and political message rests on Ice Cubes Calvin. A decent honest man with a well-developed sense of responsibility and a passion for social justice hes an iconic American type - the reluctant hero. Hed rather tend to his own garden but when called to duty hes all in. Barbershop The Next Cut ends with an inspiring call to individual action. But as Calvin concedes the problems he faces are so entrenched so systemic so complex there is very little any one person can do to make a real difference. Im grateful for the ambivalence Instead of offering easy answers Barbershop The Next Cut raises important difficult and timely questions. tirdadphillynews.com215-854-2736 Barbershop The Next CutDirected by Malcolm D.

"Humor and serious issues cut close to the funnybone in Barbershop The Next Cut - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Humor and serious issues cut close to the funnybone in Barbershop The Next Cut Barbershop Chuck Zlotnick Ice Cube as Calvin in ""Barbershop The Next Cut."" Ice Cube as Calvin in ""Barbershop The Next Cut."" (Chuck Zlotnick) Mark OlsenContact Reporter It feels like a bit of a cheat to say that ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" is clearly the best of the series. The current filmmakers had the two previous films (and a short-lived TV show and spinoff movie) to study and grow from and the new film amplifies those films positive qualities even while suffering from essentially the same drawbacks. Regardless ""The Next Cut"" manages to be entertaining and thoughtful harmless fun but just serious enough not to seem frivolous.Returning producers Robert Teitel and George L. Tillman Jr. have this time out brought on writers Kenya Barris (""black-ish"") and Tracy Oliver (""Survivors Remorse"") and director Malcolm D. Lee (""The Best Man""). The movie juggles so many characters and story lines that it often feels like an extended television pilot place-setting for future episodes. The Barbershop writers took great pains to make The Next Cut current and to avoid worn-out tropes Trevell Anderson The formula for so-called black films is both specific and ill-defined Jenifer Lewis Lynn Whitfield or Loretta Devine lead a mostly black cast with Taye Diggs or Morris Chestnut in there somewhere; Spike Lee or Tyler Perry is writer director and star; every character hides their purse around... The formula for so-called black films is both specific and ill-defined Jenifer Lewis Lynn Whitfield or Loretta Devine lead a mostly black cast with Taye Diggs or Morris Chestnut in there somewhere; Spike Lee or Tyler Perry is writer director and star; every character hides their purse around... (Trevell Anderson) The ""Barbershop"" movies have all been rooted essentially in talk as the basic premise is the easygoing atmosphere of a neighborhood barbershop and the friendly banter and off-handed wisdom that is dispensed there. As with the previous films it is at its weakest when it becomes mired in plot rather than savoring the free flow of just hanging out. Yet at a time when so many franchises exist in the cocoon of self-contained universes to evade the real-world implications of their stories -- hence the endless images of large-scale urban destruction -- the ""Barbershop"" films at least make the effort to grapple with a world the rest of us might recognize too.This new film explicitly takes on a contemporary urban blight as shop owner Calvin (Ice Cube) is becoming increasingly troubled by the gun violence plaguing his neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago. He is especially worried that his teenage son may be about to join a gang so Calvin encourages a weekend cease fire between the gangs in exchange for free haircuts and extended community get-togethers at his shop. All three ""Barbershop"" films have been rooted in Calvins ambivalence in taking over his fathers business and this time he contemplates selling for a new location in a different neighborhood. Barbershop Chuck Zlotnick / AP Nicki Minaj foreground from left Eve and Common appear in a scene from ""Barbershop The Next Cut."" Nicki Minaj foreground from left Eve and Common appear in a scene from ""Barbershop The Next Cut."" (Chuck Zlotnick / AP) Barris is the creator of the TV show ""black-ish"" and his sensibility a mix of the silly and the serious meshes well with the world of ""Barbershop."" The same goes for Oliver whose credits include the Web series ""The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl"" and likewise for Lee whose previous work includes the hit ensemble ""Best Man"" films and the satirical comedy ""Undercover Brother."" The trio are a rather inspired choice to apply their talents to the sincerity and self-awareness of the ""Barbershop"" universe.The movie also catches its star Ice Cube at a particularly pivotal moment riding high off the recent success of ""Straight Outta Compton"" which portrayed the story of the rap group that first launched him to stardom. Though he has ridden that incongruity for some time there is a fresh tension in seeing one of the writers of ""F-- tha Police"" now admonishing others not to curse and to dress conservatively. Cube portrays parenting and mature adulthood as a constant balancing act of priorities and responsibilities. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link The cast is such a deep bench of talent that a number of performers at times even Ice Cube himself can be lost in the shuffle. Costar Deon Cole of ""black-ish"" ""The New Girl"" cast member Lamorne Morris musicians Common Tyga and Nicki Minaj and actors Gina Hall and J.B. Smoove all join the cast for the first time alongside returning performers such as Cedric the Entertainer Eve Anthony Anderson Troy Garity and Sean Patrick Thomas.The film is overstuffed with cultural references from jokes on Obama or Beyonce to Black Lives Matter the phrase ""on fleek"" and a poster for the seminal Chicago high school basketball documentary ""Hoop Dreams."" While many land and give the film a certain spark there is also a disconcerting number of variations of the phrase ""trending on Twitter"" that comes to feel like someone anxiously trying a little too hard to show how hip they are. The film does not have the edge of anger that coursed through ""Chi-Raq"" the recent film also on Chicago gun violence by Lees cousin Spike Lee. What the two films do share is a sense of incomprehension an inability to process how this became the world. But rather than impish satire ""The Next Cut"" responds with a resigned feeling of commitment to simply continue to press on. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Coming 12 years after the second film ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" may be a movie few were exactly clamoring for or expecting. Even as it does plug into the current cultural moment this is not a great piece of filmmaking but its good enough in a way that feels pleasant and even comforting. By being engaging but not too pointed topical without being particularly provocative the film is a sharply executed version of the warm and amiable movie it sets out to be.""Barbershop The Next Cut"" somehow overachieves a movie that fulfills its own modest goals in a big way.------------Barbershop The Next CutRunning time 1 hour 51 minutesRating PG-13 for sexual material and languagePlaying In wide releasemark.olsenlatimes.comFollow on Twitter IndieFocus Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on April 15 2016 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""Cuts close to funnybone - Humorous new `Barbershop handles serious issues without getting into a lather. - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Movies Entertainment Reviews Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined TV viewership for Hillary Clintons acceptance speech is smaller than Donald Trumps Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad78deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-0415-barbershop-the-next-cut-review-20160415-story.html,200,barbershop8,barbershop,latimes

That is because Ice Cube who is reprising his role as Chicago barbershop owner Calvin Palmer Jr. made sure that this third in the popular series has both heart and social relevance. So the jokes still sting -- everyone from President Barack Obama to disgraced comedian Bill Cosby gets skewered as Cubes almost all-black cast goes gonzo again on celebrities -- but the antics inside the South Side shop are informed by the deadly serious events going on outside in the neighbourhood. In the years since the original Barbershop (2002) and its sequel Barbershop 2 Back in Business (2004) Chicago has become the murder capital of America in real life. The gang violence on the South Side with black-on-black violence and hundreds of murders cannot be ignored. Not even by a Hollywood comedy shot on location in Atlanta (even though the story remains set in Chicago). The problems in Chicago have created a national tragedy that was also the focus of Spike Lees most recent film the biting satire Chi-Raq. As for Barbershop and its approach Cube himself grew up in South Central Los Angeles. That neighbourhood also suffered through an era of gang violence that was depicted in Cubes film debut 25 years ago John Singletons Boyz n the Hood. So Cube knows and feels what is going on in Chicago. In the new movie the shop has gone co-ed since the days of Barbershop 2. Cubes Calvin and the boys -- among them the hilariously uncensored Cedric the Entertainer as oldtimer Eddie -- have one half of the establishment for their chairs. On the other side Regina Halls blue-haired Angie looks after the girls in their chairs among them rapper Nicki Minaj as the sexy schemer Draya. She gets Commons Rashad in trouble with his longtime gal Eves Terri. The ensemble with both new characters and familiar faces from the past Barbershop movies also includes Anthony Anderson J.B. Smoove Sean Patrick Thomas Lamorne Morris Troy Garity in a cameo Reggie Brown as the Obama impersonator and Chicago-born NBA star Anthony Davis as himself -- a man who makes fun of his own unibrow. All the antics are a laugh-riot although some audience members (including me) sometimes have to concentrate on the slang phrases to suss out the meaning of some of the jokes. The socio-political riots however are universally understood. The Next Cut operates on two levels with the serious material. Both Cube and Common have to worry that their high school-aged sons might be seduced by members of a local gang trying to recruit fresh members to do their dirty work. Family relationships are given time and sensitivity by director Malcolm D. Lee who was working from a well-balanced screenplay by Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver. On the macro level The Next Cut also boldly addresses the gang violence and its effect on the barbershops South Side neighbourhood as a larger City of Chicago issue. To survive especially as a neighbourhood centre the barbershop partners have to come up with a fresh way of dealing with gangs especially because two of the rival gang leaders come into the shop for their cuts. Always on different days ... until ... Well there is no point in offering spoilers. The Next Cut is compelling in how it plays out its core story without ever losing its ability to crack jokes.

Richard Roeper richardroeper | email You dont expect a comedy to give you the chills but the opening scene in ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" did exactly that to me. Its been a decade and a half since weve seen Ice Cubes Calvin Palmer proprietor of the South Side barbershop where theres as much conversation as cutting on any given day. The neighborhood has fallen on hard times. Crime is up. Gunshots and sirens are the soundtrack of the day. We see real-life news footage of recent tragedies and protests that have put Chicago in the national spotlight. Says Calvin to his beloved hometown Chicago we need to talk. Maybe its because Im from the south suburbs and Ive lived in the city for 25 years -- and through the years Ive written many a column and done many a TV and radio show about violence in the city -- but when Calvin talked about the violence has him rethinking his love affair with the city it hit home hard. Not only is ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" one of the funniest movies in recent years its a poignant and timely drama about the dilemma facing many parents in certain Chicago neighborhoods where crime is a fact of life as much as you want to live where your family has lived for generations as much as you dont want to be pushed out of your home is it better for your children if you move the family elsewhere? Calvin and his wife Jennifer (Jazsmin Lewis) have done everything they can to make sure their son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.) concentrates on his studies and his basketball game while avoiding the gang influences lurking around every corner and even in the high school hallways. But when a model student from the neighborhood gets caught in the crossfire of another senseless exchange of gunfire Calvin contemplates selling the barbershop and relocating his family and the business to the North Side. This is the serious side of ""Barbershop The Next Cut."" The issues are examined in appropriately somber tones and even though ""The Next Cut"" was actually filmed in Atlanta the discussions of violence and the scenes involving a nasty punk of a gang leader named Yummy (well played by Tyga) feel Chicago-authentic. Its impressive how well director Malcolm D. Lee (working from a script by Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver) balances the serious material with the bawdy freewheeling comedy pieces. Out of economic necessity Calvins barbershop is now sharing space with the beauty shop run by Angie (Regina Hall) so the stage is set every morning for gender (and generational) verbal warfare with Nicki Minajs Draya leading the charge for the ladies while Cedric the Entertainers crusty old Eddie does the most of the talking from the guys point of view. Adding to the comedic mix J.B. Smoove as the smooth-talking ""One Stop"" who can and will sell you just about anything imaginable; Deon Cole as Dante a daily regular customer who apparently has no place else to go and Troy Garity as Isaac perhaps the only white guy who regularly pops into the barbershop. At times ""The Next Cut"" is almost too ambitious in its attempt to cover myriad bases. In addition to the plot lines about Calvins family violence in Chicago Eddies claim he once cut the hair of a young Barack Obama and Anthony Andersons J.D. operating a food truck theres a romantic triangle of sorts involving Rashad (Common) and his wife Terri (Eve) and Draya who has designs on Rashad. Its the least interesting and least effective story thread in the film. Just about everything else clicks thanks in no small part to the wonderful performances from the deep cast. The father-son dynamic between Ice Cube and Michael Rainey Jr. is emotionally involving and almost heartbreaking at times. Common gives one of his best performances as Rashad a good husband a loving and a loyal friend. Regina Hall is a rock as the independent strong Angie and Cedric hits another home run as the hilariously outspoken Eddie. Im not going to tell you if Eddie really did cut Barack Obamas hair back in the day but when the truth is revealed it makes for one hilarious epilogue. 1/2 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures and New Line Cinema present a film directed by Malcolm D.

"Barbershop The Next Cut blends comedy and drama | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBarbershop The Next Cut blends comedy and drama The third instalment in the Barbershop series balances comedy with a serious subject gang violence.Michael Rainey Jr. as Jalen and Ice Cube as Calvin share a father and son moment in Barbershop The Next Cut.  (Chuck Zlotnick / WARNER BROS.)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. April 14 2016Barbershop The Next CutStarring Ice Cube Cedric the Entertainer. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee. Opens April 15 at GTA theatres. 112 minutes. 14A.Its the third instalment of the Barbershop franchise and the big question is Will Calvin cut and run?The original Barbershop (2002) dealt with Calvins desire to sell out the place his dad and granddad built and the second Back in Business (2004) dealt with corporate competition and neighbourhood gentrification.Article Continued BelowThis one -- like Spike Lees most recent film Chi-Raq -- deals with a more weighty theme the explosion of gang violence and the toll it takes on communities.Calvins secret plan to move out of Chicagos deadly South Side is one of the numerous storylines running the film. A second involves his teenage son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.) being wooed to join a gang.There are many new faces including rap artist Nicki Minaj as sassy stylist Draya who tries to separate Calvins friend and colleague Rashad (Common) from his girlfriend.Of course now that the shop is fully coed the daily banter involves sexual politics as well as the realpolitik experience of everyday African-Americans. Black Lives Matter is mentioned a few times and there are references to everyone from Barack Obama to Bill Cosby.As always Ice Cube is the solid emotional core of the ensemble and he gets plenty of wisecracking support from Cedric the Entertainer -- unflatteringly dubbed ""Negro-saurus"" -- as Eddie.The script does feel clunky at times and overladen with minor characters and plot lines and theres certainly a tension between the comedy and the films more dramatic moments.The attitude toward white people is casually dismissive as in something that is ""very very Caucasian"" is necessarily unhip and the banter about big booties and male endowment feels gratuitous at times.But amidst the broad comedy and mawkishness -- e.g. an appearance by an Obama look-alike -- there are enough moments that feel both real and true to make one hope the latest cut isnt the final one.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsSquadGoals Will Smith Margot Robbie on Suicide Squad red carpet in TorontoToronto mayor John Tory showed up to thank the stars for shooting the summer tent-pole movie in the city.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

""The birthplace of the skyscraper deep-dish pizza Don Cornelius Kanye West. The home of the Cubs Bulls and the undisputed queen of daytime television Oprah""--in other words a city rich (in both culture and cholesterol) with history. But theres no denying the mess of the present ""The streets are talking"" he says. ""Theyre tired. Theyre angry."" That voiceover is the first hint that Next Cut is aiming for something beyond the loose big-hearted comedy of the franchises three previous outings. (Its last entry 2005s Atlanta-set Beauty Shop was technically a spinoff). From the first installment in 2002 the series has always rallied around certain core values the importance of loyalty and friendship and family; the space a local shop provides not just for cutting hair but for centering and serving a community. Here though the specter of violence looms early and large Calvins Southside storefront is plagued by neighborhood decay and almost-daily gunshots; some customers are too scared to even come by anymore while others are too dangerous to let in the door. Black-ish creator Kenya Barris who penned the script along with Tracy Oliver (Starz Survivors Remorse) struggles sometimes to balance easy banter with serious issues; cracks about bad weaves Instagram and STDs toggle with sobering talk about Trayvon Martin Freddie Grey and whether Obama really serves his black constituents. Certain jokes cut sharper than a fresh clipper set; others land with a dull safety-scissors thud. The cast has also expanded to include new additions like Nicki Minaj Tyga Regina Hall and New Girls Lamorne Morris while retaining most of the original stars and the crisscrossing of personalities and plotlines can feel both chaotic and sitcom-stagey. (When one minor character is killed offscreen its not really a surprise; his one-note sweetness seems to have doomed him from the start). Still the movie works hard to take on both everyday concerns (money romance keeping a small business afloat) and deeper dramas (Calvin has to keep a lockbox for certain regulars guns and theres a local gang actively recruiting his son) without losing the spark that brought the franchise this far in the first place. And even when it falls short of its aim to get every last Beyonce joke and Big Idea onscreen the movie still offers what any barbershop worth its repeat customers provides An hour or two of good company and the feeling that youre leaving a little sharper than when you came in.

Warner Bros. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In the annals of improbable things happening in the movie industry the travails of a struggling hair salon on Chicagos South Side may have been the oddest formula ever for a film series. So Im happy to report that the delightful ""Barbershop"" franchise now opening its third installment remains not a harebrained scheme but a viable fan favorite. Its not groundbreaking stuff but its solid fun. If a studio is going to deliver a niche audience high-concept low-cost films this is the way to go. I would rather watch this than a post-apocalypse action movie any day. The new chapter ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" once again touches controversial social topics and attitudes with ridiculous humor and well-done horse sense. It returns us to Calvins Barbershop a charming slice of community life with an ensemble of believable people interacting in real situations. Ice Cube hosts the visitors as the shops manager whose indestructible gumption is under pressure. He narrates a prologue that shows how recent years have become very tough for Chicagoans. Gangs in the citys South and West sides have pushed gun-related violence to extremely dangerous levels. Its a troubling situation that flares up repeatedly off-screen. Things have come a long way since 2002 when the top worries in the original ""Barbershop"" were loan sharks and ATM thieves. On a more personal note his teenage sons conflicts with neighborhood rivals may force his transfer to a safer Catholic school. ""Its time you met some Catholics"" Calvin barks. And his business formerly a mens-only club has expanded into a coed debate society. Female customers beauticians and cosmetologists take up equal space in the shop regularly steering discussions to the topic of two-timing boyfriends. The cast is packed with players who get their individual moments in the limelight balancing a bit of real drama with scabrously funny dialogue. Cedric the Entertainer returns as Eddie the sarcastic old stylist who spends most of his day firing off hilarious reverse racism. Common joins the crew as a love mate for Eve whose success pulls her out of the shop and makes her suspect him of disappearing suspiciously into the backroom with Nicki Minaj. This sets up a number of booty jokes that are raunchy fun balancing some serious announcements that devastate the barbers and move them to take action to calm the streets. Barbershop The Next Cut  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sexual material and language. These are not parallel plot lines. Director Malcolm D. Lee is not giving us a cross-section of urban life but one that goes left right and diagonal all at once. The films unapologetic political viewpoint doesnt always make sense. One cherished character is presented as an aide to the citys real-life leader Rahm Emanuel the least popular mayor in modern Chicago history. Still Calvins Barbershop has evolved from its roots (six cutters one a token woman one a token white) to the crowded multicultural 21st century. While it comes across at times like a talk show where everyone interrupts the film has a good-hearted aura thats very hard to resist. colincovert ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Its a gathering place for storytelling with the subject matter ranging from wrangles between the male and female employees to whether President Barack Obama has done enough for black America. When things are on the verge of getting out of control Calvin is good at calming everybody down.But hes beginning to think that his days in the neighborhood are drawing to a close. Gun violence is up with gangs roaming the streets and the mayhem threatening his business. Calvins particularly worried that his son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.) could be swept up into the gang lifestyle. And thats a possibility hes just not willing to accept. +3 Ice Cube and Jazsmin Lewis-Kelley in ""Barbershop The Next Cut."" Warner Bros. Pictures photo Chuck Zlotnick Calvins barber pals are no less concerned. The elderly cantankerous Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) has turned the gangster threat into a running joke while family man Rashad (Common) hopes that a 48-hour ceasefire -- with free haircuts thrown in as perks -- will help to heal the neighborhood. But what can anyone no matter how well-meaning or committed really do to stop the madness?""Barbershop The Next Cut"" combines the broad comedy that moviegoers have come to expect from the franchise with social commentary thats surprisingly effective. Working from a screenplay by Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver director Malcolm D. Lee (""The Best Man Holiday"") keeps the laughs coming while maintaining an undercurrent of urgency. Thats reflected in the performances -- particularly from Ice Cube who doesnt always get the credit he deserves for his acting skills. If Calvin wasnt such an entertainingly flummoxed straight man the comic chaos engulfing him wouldnt come off anywhere near as well. If ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" ends on an improbably upbeat note the franchise is to be commended for daringly stepping outside its comfort zone.What ""Barbershop The Next Cut""  Three stars out of four  Run time 149  Rating PG-13  Content Sexual material and language Calvin Wilson  314-340-8346calvinwilsonstl on Twittercalvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Tags Barbershop The Next Cut Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson Calvin Wilson is an arts writer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

(Warning Contains some NSFW language.) Ice Cube (left) and Common co-star in ""Barbershop The Next Cut.""(Photo Warner Bros.)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3.5 out of 5 starsThe latest installment in the ""Barbershop"" franchise has a huge leg up on the 2002 original and its 2004 sequel Its 2016 and a film set in Chicagos current-day South Side with a predominantly Black cast is rife with dramatic possibility. ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" embraces the societal changes and rifts of the past decade from Chicagos increased violence and the Black Lives Matter movement to Barack Obamas historic presidency making the film an even more heartfelt love letter to Chicago.RELATED Barbershop reopens with timely Next CutCalvins Barbershop is the same familiar comfort it has always been to both its patrons and filmgoers. The South Side mainstay is as much a community center as it is a place to get your hair cut where barbers and customers alike riff on politics current events relationships and more. One side is a barbershop where owner Calvin (Ice Cube) Rashad (Common) and crotchety old Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) hold court; the other a beauty parlor where co-owner Angie (Regina Hall) and newcomer Draya (Nicki Minaj) install weaves and engage the men in social and sexual banter.Nicki Minaj joins the cast in the latest ""Barbershop"" movie. (Photo Warner Bros.)While not much has changed inside the shop the streets around it have. South Side is rampant with violent crime and gang activity so much so that Calvin keeps a gun safe in the shop to hold clients pieces while he cuts their hair; and rival gang members have to be carefully scheduled to avoid confrontation.The violence goes one step too far when it enters Calvins home. His teenage son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.) is toying with the idea of joining a gang. Hes talking back getting into fights and drawing gang symbols and after one bad omen too many Calvin moves forward with his secret plan to uproot the shop to the calmer North Side.There are heavy conversations inside as the streets erupt around them and they delve into topics as complicated as the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Eric Garner the Charleston church massacre and whether or not President Obama has done enough for the Black community. ""We Black. Its hard"" someone says. ""Hard and us go hand in hand.""Common (left) joins Cedric the Entertainer and Ice Cube (right) in ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" the third film in the franchise. (Photo Warner Bros.)Those conversations are well balanced by plenty of levity. Sexual politics play as big of a role as actual politics and the two sides of the shop lob many friendly grenades about dating and marriage. A subplot sees Draya moving in on Rashad who is very much already claimed by Terri (Eve) with hilarious and ill-fated results.Disappointingly the barbershop/beauty shop combo does not offer the women equal voice or screen time.

Photo Chuck Zlotnick MOVIE REVIEW BARBERSHOP THE NEXT CUT Running time 111 minutes. Rated PG-13 (heavy sexual innuendo). Ice Cube the once-incendiary NWA rapper celebrating a quarter-century as one of Hollywoods unlikeliest stars winningly resurrects his ""Barbershop franchise to broker a truce in the Chicago gang wars. More than a decade after the second installment was followed by an unsuccessful spinoff (""Beauty Shop with Queen Latifah) and a short-lived TV series things have gotten so bad on the South Side that Ice Cubes Calvin is considering moving to a safer part of town. Calvin also suspects that his teenage son (Michael Rainey Jr.) may be on the verge of joining a gang underlining an edgy topical theme that director Malcolm D. Lees film shares with his cousin Spikes ""Chi-Raq. When the city contemplates street closures to limit the mounting death toll Calvin uses his influence to negotiate a cease-fire which he publicizes by giving away free haircuts. ""The Next Cut is still basically a workplace comedy and the writers have freshened the formula by having Calvins space shared by the women (headed by Regina Hall) who used to work in the now-closed beauty shop next door. There is still lots of good-natured insult comedy much of it dished out by the crotchety old-timer Eddie again played by Cedric the Entertainer and Anthony Anderson as the now-reformed J.D. Amusing newcomers include a flashy entrepreneur (J.B. Smoove) a sensitive young barber whose sexuality provokes much speculation (Lamorne Morris) and even a token Indian haircutter (Utkarsh Ambudkar). There is also a major romantic subplot that almost feels like it wandered in from another movie featuring singer Nicki Minaj who steals every scene as Draya a buxom stylist trying to tempt Calvins friend Rashad (Common) away from his hard-working wife Terri (the singularly named Eve). Director Lee best known for the ""Best Man comedies handles the huge excellent ensemble and tonal shifts with skill as the crew argues about sexism and politics along the way mocking everyone from President Obama and R. Kelly to Bill Cosby and the Kardashians. ""Barbershop The Next Cut is a cut above the seasons other belated sequels like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2 and ""Zoolander 2.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Alan Zilberman April 14 From left Common Cedric the Entertainer and Ice Cube in ""Barbershop The Next Cut."" (Chuck Zlotnick/Warner Bros. Pictures) Just as the men and women at Calvins Barbershop are older and have more responsibilities so too is ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" more mature than its cinematic predecessors. Director Malcolm D. Lee and his screenwriters raise the stakes of ""Barbershop"" and its 2004 sequel by taking Chicagos ongoing gang violence seriously making it the focus of the plot. But since the film is a comedy first the one-liners serve as a welcome form of levity. This is a delicate balancing act -- one which the large acting ensemble pulls off with effortless chemistry. In the 2002 original the workers saw Calvins as a space where men could let their hair down -- pun intended -- and speak their minds freely. Now that Calvin (Ice Cube) has joined forces with Angie (Regina Hall) and her beauty shop Calvins is neutral territory in the ongoing battle of the sexes. This neutrality takes on a larger purpose since gangbangers also visit the shop. After discussing how politicians ignore the South Side Calvin and Angie organize the community around the shop persuading rival gangs to participate in a 48-hour cease-fire. Everyones enthusiastic about the idea but Calvins son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.) is about to be initiated into one of the gangs. The ""Barbershop"" films have always had multiple subplots yet the films are more about the characters holding court. Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) rambles about how the neighborhood used to be for example while Raja (Utkarsh Ambudkar) tries to argue that Obamas presidency means that African Americans now face less institutional racism than before. The filmmaker treats all viewpoints with respect; part of the fun is seeing whom we agree with more than others. Nicki Minaj in ""Barbershop The Next Cut."" (Chuck Zlotnick/Warner Bros. Pictures) Although this sounds like pretty serious stuff everyone at Calvins is so relaxed -- and naturally funny -- using jokes not just argument to make their points. Some subplots exist primarily for comedy Rashad (Common) must resist advances from Draya (Nicki Minaj) -- the screenplay includes several asides about her figure -- while Rashads wife Terri (Eve) grows jealous. Lee avoids formula enough that the smaller stories have rewarding payoffs. And when tensions are at their peak he throws in a dance sequence just to remind us that everyone still cares for one another. ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" is a gentler alternative to ""Chi-Raq"" Spike Lees bracing satire about Chicago street violence. (Spike Lee and Malcolm D. Lee are cousins). If ""Chi-Raq"" aimed to shock us out of complacency ""The Next Cut"" creates a more welcoming groove encouraging greater openness to outside perspectives. The cast is huge many with larger-than-life personalities so its inevitable that Lee will not be able to give them all the attention they deserve. Compared with the settings of most movies however this ""Barbershop"" remains a place where almost anyone would love to while away a long easygoing afternoon. PG-13. At area theaters. Contains coarse language and sexual situations. 112 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The last few years have seen plenty of sequels trailing their predecessors by over a decade. This is undeniably the case with Barbershop The Next Cut; its separated from the second Barbershop by 12 years and from the original film by almost 14. But despite the passage of time the influx of new characters and the fact that formerly young-ish barbershop proprietor Calvin (Ice Cube) is now parenting a teenage son The Next Cut doesnt really feel like a years-later follow-up. Maybe its because most of the actors who do return including Cube rapper Eve and a reduced-role Sean Patrick Thomas have barely appeared to age since 2004 or maybe its because Cedric The Entertainer wears pretty much the same semi-unconvincing hair and makeup as he did playing a sixtysomething a dozen years ago ignoring the fact that his character Eddie should have advanced even farther into old age by now.Its more likely though that The Next Cut doesnt feel like a musty revival because it has such a simple durable comfortable premise Calvins barbershop hosts a variety of conversational riffing and romantic entanglements while eventually facing some kind of threat to its South Side neighborhood in Chicago. After tackling foreclosure and gentrification Calvin and company are now dealing with escalating gang violence in their beloved city and whether or not it will ensnare Calvins son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.). At times Calvins (and by extension the movies) anger and frustration with neighborhood violence makes the film feel like a companion piece to Spike Lees recent Chi-Raq.Of course theres plenty of workaday soap mixed into the social consciousness. The movie doesnt really differentiate between bits of continuity from the previous films and the variety of events that have happened during the offscreen interim such as Terri (Eve) marrying previously unseen Rashad (Common) and Calvin fusing his dude-heavy barbershop with a group of female stylists led by Angie (Regina Hall arriving in the Barberverse sporting snazzy blue hair). Though some of this can be confusing for anyone with a hazy memory of the earlier films--including spin-off Beauty Shop--it also makes this the rare third-parter thats fairly inviting for new viewers never too beholden to its series past. New characters like Rashad nerdy Jerrod (New Girls Lamorne Morris) flirtatious Draya (Nicki Minaj) and enterprising One-Stop (J.B. Smoove) get substantial screen time. Morris and Smoove are particularly natural comic additions to the cast underlining the best part about any Barbershop movie watching a lot of funny charming actors (and sometimes also rapper/actors) enjoy the opportunity to chat philosophize or even express political opinions--something a lot of studio comedies work strenuously to avoid. This time out the characters hold court on Obama American racism Instagram sexuality and gender roles among other topics. Nothing anyone says is much edgier more insightful or more topical than the dialogue in any number of sitcoms (Black-ish creator Kenya Barris even worked on the script). But a movie theater like a barbershop is a communal space and the clamorous conversation plays especially well to a crowd eager to spend time with a bunch of likable stars.The movie would be even more welcoming if director Malcolm D. Lee made better use of the barbershop as a physical location; in a few scenes the blocking is far more confusing than it should be for a set that only has three rooms. The outside-barbershop moments dont fare any better at least technically speaking; whenever the movie cuts to Calvin and his family at home it feels as if the actors have been waiting there silently for their scene to start. The family stuff also drifts away from the movies ensemble strengths but its a forgivable sort of neglect when Cube and company seem so determined to address and condemn real-world violence. Again there are few groundbreaking insights offered. But as a borderline cornball but effective social-issue film The Next Cut explicitly and smartly avoids the presentation of easy answers. The second half of the movie hinges on the barbershop gang staging a weekend cease-fire and Calvin isnt shy about wondering aloud whether that kind of peaceful protest can have any effects whatsoever--and if he ought to leave for more gentrified environs. Though this series is built on comic looseness its that sincerity that carries through its minor comedic missteps like underusing Hall and leaning too heavily on Cedrics wacky-old-man shtick. In about six hours spaced out over a decade and a half the Barbershop movies have generated the warmth of a familiar TV show without the time demands of hundreds of episodes. The question isnt why revive Barbershop after so many years but rather can Ice Cube do more of these and fewer Ride Alongs?

Common (left) and Eve in the ""Barbershop"" that since the previous films in the series has now become a unisex center of the community. Photo Chuck Zlotnick AP New Barbershop Comedy with a pensive edge 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Very early in ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" an odd mood settles in. The mood is comic but anxious. The barbershop is a special place a place where life happens but its not protected. So even while were laughing were glancing at the door and wondering who or what awful thing will come through it. Its a special kind of movie that can find a tone broad enough to accommodate comedy and the possibility of tragedy. And the powerful suggestion here the one that sinks in and will not leave is that this tone captures something of the urban black experience. Its a movie about a communitys resiliency but also about parents having to worry about their children and about people dodging bullets on the way to work. So ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" is a funny movie but also a serious movie and -- who knows? -- maybe an important one. Its very much about a place the South Side of Chicago and about a time as in right now. In the barbershop they talk about Obama Trayvon Martin Eric Garner -- and other issues that were in the news as recently as six months ago. This is a different barbershop from the one in the previous ""Barbershop"" movies. Once a male sanctuary it is now a unisex place or rather its two businesses in one. On one side Calvin (Ice Cube) and his male employees including Cedric the Entertainer as Eddie take care of the male customers. And the other side Angie (a brilliant Regina Hall) and her staff take care of the women. As a business its about as real as the nightclub in ""Flashdance"" offering full-time employment to eight people despite only a steady trickle of customers. But as a movie location its ideal. The characters are vivid all in one place and they keep talking. The fact that this time women are present expands the range of conversation. This time theres even the possibility of sexual tension as when Draya (a hard-to-resist Nicki Minaj) starts eyeing one of her married co-workers (Common). The length of the scenes and the expansiveness of the conversations in ""The Next Cut"" can almost feel clumsy especially if were used to the clipped brevity of scenes in most modern movies. But if this is clumsy its the clumsiness of sincerity and authenticity. In one scene they argue about whether 2016 is the best time (so far) to be black in America and the various sides of the issue are interesting to hear -- and funny too. The conclusion It probably is the best time ""unless youre Bill Cosby."" Meanwhile everything going on outside the barbershop isnt funny at all. There are gang killings every day and in one case schedules have to be arranged so that rival gang members dont show up for haircuts at the same time. In one scene (almost) everyone drops to the floor because there are gunshots on the street. The one who stays upright is Eddie who says it would take him too long to get back up. Though Kenya Barris and Tracy Olivers screenplay skillfully juggles a number of characters and plotlines the tension in Calvins life is at the center. He has a teenage son who is having trouble in school and though he doesnt know for sure he suspects (accurately) that he is about to join a gang. Fed up Calvin wants to open a shop in a safer neighborhood and enroll his son in a new school. His mixed feelings form the question at the heart of the movie whether its better to stay and fight or run to safety. Theres no good or satisfying answer to that question which means that there can be no easy resolution for ""Barbershop The Next Cut."" By the time its over the characters may have decided on their best course but the audience hasnt decided at all. The audience isnt sure. That hint of unease that contrary feeling that pulls from the general mood is a product of the movies truthfulness and an emblem of its quality. We see a mans dilemma and frustration passionately played by Ice Cube but we dont know what he should do. So we leave the theater thinking about him and wondering about everybody else in the same position. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Photo Credit Warner Bros. Pictures / Chuck Zlotnick advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A barbershop on Chicagos South Side becomes the hub of an anti-violence crusade.CAST Ice Cube Cedric the Entertainer Nicki MinajRATED PG-13 (Adult talk and sexual themes)LENGTH 151BOTTOM LINE The franchise hasnt improved quality-wise but the racially charged humor still crackles. South Centrals Ice Cube and Brooklyns Spike Lee hail from opposite coasts but lately theyve found common ground in a city almost equidistant Chicago. Lees wild satire ""Chi-Raq"" a gangster-ized version of Aristophanes ""Lysistrata"" from last year addressed the ongoing violence on the citys South Side. In a less erudite fashion Cubes new comedy ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" does the same. The third film in the ""Barbershop"" franchise (not counting the spinoff ""Beauty Shop"") stars Cube as Calvin who long ago abandoned his big dreams to run his late fathers South Side barbershop. (Cue the hip-hop theme to ""Its a Wonderful Life."") The shop isnt just a business but a social hub where folks spread gossip dissect the news and speak the truth. Eavesdropping on the conversations -- staged though they are -- has always been the best part of these movies. (Heaven knows it isnt the threadbare plots.) advertisement | advertise on newsday Thats still true in ""The Next Cut"" directed by Malcolm D. Lee (a cousin to Spike) and written by Kenya Barris (ABCs ""Black-ish"") with Tracy Oliver. The banter starts almost immediately and it crackles with life. Here in Calvins shop Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity) can freely admit he prefers ""the sisters"" even while black women grumble that black men prefer Kim Kardashian to Lupita Nyongo. All of this is great fun; too bad it has to end so the storylines can begin. Calvin and his buddy Rashad (Common) have sons who are flirting with the gangster life; Rashad is trying to avoid the clutches of oversexed Draya (a very good Nicki Minaj); the slick businessman One-Stop (JB Smoove) floats Calvin a questionable loan a plot so similar to the original films that Smoove repeats a few lines and gestures. The main story involves Calvin creating a South Side cease-fire by offering haircuts to rival gangs for free. Its hard to grumble too much about ""The Next Cut"" when its heart is so clearly in the right place.

Warner Bros. Pictures A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The effortless charisma of Ice Cube and Cedric the Entertainer the headliners of the first two Barbershop movies (released in 2002 and 2004) helped keep those over-plotted comedies buoyant. Cube and Cedric are back as Calvin and Eddie in Barbershop the Next Cut but even their enormous appeal cant rescue the third installment in the franchise. Nor can director Malcolm D. Lee whos overseen an impressive number of breezy productions The Best Man (1999) and its 2013 sequel Undercover Brother (2002) Roll Bounce (2005). Scripted by Black-ish creator Kenya Barris and Tracy Oliver The Next Cut is glutted even more than its predecessors with ancient fellas-versus-females debates ungainly sociopolitical commentary and top-40 superstars trying to diversify their brands.""Lately weve been having trouble"" Calvin the owner of the South Side tonsorium that bears his name says in voiceover in the opening montage -- a sunny Earth Wind amp; Fire-scored paean to Chicago glories like deep-dish pizza and Oprah that soon turns into a disaster reel of the gun violence that has plagued the city. Calvin is determined to stay in the battle-weary neighborhood though; to keep solvent he has expanded his onetime all-male sanctum to include a ladies salon overseen by green-ringleted Angie (Regina Hall). Yet the coed space only intensifies the Mars/Venus divide ""The only man you can trust is the man upstairs"" fumes stylist Bree (Margot Bingham) one of several lines suggesting a T.D. Jakes homily.Film Details Barbershop The Next Cut RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time112 min. More Info Trailer The intragender feuds are just as fractious. Bree often clashes with co-worker Draya (Nicki Minaj) a weave specialist who must also contend with some serious side eye from Terri (Eve whose acting career was launched with the first Barbershop but may end with the third). The reigning hip-hop queen appears contractually obliged to say fleek if only to provoke old-timer Eddies grumpy lecture on neologisms. The smack talk is much sharper and funnier between the gray panther and One-Stop (J.B. Smoove) whose innumerable side hustles -- VD testing dental work counseling real estate -- prove the freshest gags.But the film too often relies on rote sermonizing when tackling the citys scourge of shootings a grave topic that The Next Cut is simply too feeble to examine with any real depth or meaning. (Though wildly uneven last years Chi-Raq directed by Lees cousin Spike at least pulses with unalloyed fury and pain about the metropoliss rising death toll.) After trying to keep his fourteen-year-old son on the straight and narrow Calvin concludes ""We gotta fix our problems ourselves."" The declaration typifies the boot-strapping conservatism that dominates all of the Barbershop movies but offered as a solution to an intractable problem sounds especially glib.

Director Malcolm D. Lee (152) PG-13 Sexual material and language. Area theaters. After twelve years Ice Cube is back wielding the scissors in ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" and his motley crew of hair-snippers still has a lot to blab about. Except this time it isnt all for laughs. Since we last saw the ""Barbershop"" crew local product Barack Obama has been elected President and the shop has gone unisex adding a new dynamic to the mix. They chatter freely about politics pop stars and other celebrities and no one is safe especially once the shops aging trimmer Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) gets going. N.W.A. DEEP PURPLE AND REST OF 2016 ENTER ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME ON HIGH NOTE From l. Common splits hairs with Cedric the Entertainer and Ice Cube in Barbershop The Next Cut. (Chuck Zlotnick/Chuck Zlotnick) Cubes Calvin is a father trying to deal with the growing crime in the shops Southside Chicago neighborhood with his teenage son being coerced to join one of the local gangs. Fellow rapper Common plays Rashad another barber whose son may be a bad influence on Calvins child causing conflict between the two colleagues. Otherwise all the franchises favorite cutups are back (except a noticeably-absent Queen Latifah) as the movie features a super-group of comedy talent including Cedric and JB Smoov from ""Curb Your Enthusiasm."" Even Anthony Anderson (from ""Blackish"") pops in as a greedy food truck owner. All these cameos arent necessary since there are enough personalities inside the shop to keep things entertaining despite there being so much dialogue. Nicki Minaj is one of a parade of big-name supporting cast-members. (Chuck Zlotnick/Chuck Zlotnick) Pop star Nikki Minaj fits in well both with the veterans and the new characters as hairstylist Drea who forms one side of a love triangle with Common and his onscreen wife Eve -- a storyline that takes away from everything else. ""The Next Cut"" is a true love letter to Chicago but one that doesnt ignore the hard truth about the problems the city still faces. The citys gang violence plays a large part in the story without ever making light of that plague. Still theres always a few laughs to counterbalance the weightiness of that subject. At times the latest ""Barbershop"" might get too serious for some but as far as the comedy goes it remains a cut above the rest.

Set in a combination barber shop/beauty salon in Chicagos South Side the titular venues status as a neighborhood sounding post and community meeting place provides context for the films speechier moments about gun violence and self-sufficiency while the colliding of familiar comedic characters - this is the third ""Barbershop"" movie fourth if you count the ""Beauty Shop"" spinoff - brings the laughs. See Video Barbershop 3 Trailer Welcomes Nicki Minaj to the Neighborhood Spike Lee took a much less prosaic look at Chicagos gang violence in last years challenging ""Chi-Raq"" but this more straightforward presentation will probably find more traction among mainstream audiences. Like much of Lees work - ""Next Cut"" was actually directed by the auteurs cousin Malcolm D. Lee (""The Best Man Holiday"") - this new comedy simultaneously addresses concerns of a black audience while allowing white viewers to feel privy to conversations they might not otherwise get to hear. The ripple effect of neighborhood violence is felt every day by shop owners Calvin (Ice Cube) and Angie (Regina Hall) and their staff whether its the periodic sound of gunfire the lack of foot traffic on their block or the perils of accidentally booking simultaneous salon appointments for rival gang leaders. And while Calvin is a second-generation small business owner hes seriously considering pulling up stakes to move his shop to a safer locale on the north side of town making efforts in that direction without bothering to consult with Angie. Calvins son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr. ""Orange is the New Black"") seems to be drifting toward getting involved with gangs himself and the city council is threatening to limit traffic flow into the South Side effectively walling off the neighborhood from the rest of the city so Calvin takes matters into his own hands declaring a 48-hour truce in the neighborhood and offering free haircuts for one weekend in an attempt to fix matters. Also Read Ice Cube Gene Simmons Beef Over NWAs Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction For all the talk of politics and violence ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" focuses mainly on the laughs and on the ensemble from the malapropisms of old-timer Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) to the attempts of sexy stylist Draya (Nicki Minaj) to inveigle herself into the marital discord of Rashad (Common) and Terri (Eve). (Minaj it should be noted demonstrates real comic chops here even while cinematographer Greg Gardiner films her prodigious derriere like the monolith in ""2001."") Screenwriters Kenya Barris (""Black-ish"") and Tracy Oliver provide plenty of one-liners for a talented cast which includes J.B. Smoove as wheeler-dealer One-Stop Utkarsh Ambudkar as the Indian haircutter Raja (whose most popular male haircut is ""the Lupita"") and scene-stealer Lamorne Morris as the nerdy Jerrod. The script has its flaws though particularly one character whos very obviously a Chekhovs gun - or in this case a Chekhovs target. Given how little the talented Hall gets to do here its frustrating how quickly Angie forgives Calvin for his attempts to yank a business that she co-owns out from under her and the running gag bout how everyone in the shop thinks that Jerrod is gay falls particularly flat. (And if the point of the 48-hour truce is to bring press attention to the beleaguered south side why do no TV cameras show up until the weekend is almost over?) See Photos Ice Cube Nicki Minaj Cedric the Entertainer Look Sharp at Barbershop The Next Cut Premiere Ultimately however ""Barbershop The Final Cut"" attempts a tricky balance between wacky comedy and real-world concerns and the result is a layered cut that looks pretty good in both mirrors.

TWITTER 4/15/2016 Returning veterans Ice Cube and Cedric the Entertainer are joined by several newcomers including Nicki Minaj in the third installment of the hit comedy franchise. A dozen years have passed and there have been some major changes but Calvins Barbershop is as enjoyable a place to hang out for a couple of hours as ever. Featuring returning favorites and several fun new characters to spice up the mix Barbershop The Next Cut the third installment in the film series brings the laughs while injecting a serious topical theme that gives it a welcome edge. Viewers should be lining up for cuts. The chief difference in this installment is notable from the outset. The Chicago South Side barber shop has gone coed as Calvin (Ice Cube) has joined forces with salon owner Angie (Regina Hall) to create a single hair-cutting emporium. Although it was a canny business move for them its even more advantageous for viewers as the resulting gender clashes provide much of the films humor such as an amusing debate about whether or not President Obama has a ""side chick."" At the same time newcomer screenwriters Kenya Barris (creator of ABCs Black-ish) and Tracy Oliver introduce a weightier tone by having much of the plot revolve around the horrific violence of the setting. When one gang member comes into the shop Calvin confiscates his gun like a saloonkeeper in the Old West. He also becomes increasingly concerned that his teenage son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.) is falling under the bad influence of his colleague Rashads (Common) son Kenny (Diallo Thompson) and is contemplating joining a gang. When the gun violence on the streets becomes particularly acute a plan is hatched to raise awareness of the problem. The shop pledges a weekend of free haircuts for everyone to promote a temporary cease-fire. Meanwhile Calvin is secretly scouting locations across town to reopen his business in a safer locale. A less rewarding subplot involves the tensions that develop between Rashad and his wife Terri (Eve) when she suspects him of fooling around with the shops sexy vampy haircutter Draya (Nicki Minaj whose fans will be pleased to know that she twerks in the film). But while these plot elements move the pic along the real appeal of the series is the relaxed and funny banter that goes on among the numerous characters in the shop. As with the previous two movies many of the laughs come courtesy of the elderly crotchety Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer) who shares his irascible views on every subject under the sun. His competition here includes such new barber arrivals as the comically nerdy Jerrod (Lamorne Morris); the Indian Raja (Utkarsh Ambudkr) who adds some ethnic humor; and the fast-talking entrepreneur One-Stop (JB Smoove). The rapid-fire dialogue which often has an improvised feel features enough funny one-liners about such subjects as R. Kelly and ""Instagram hoes"" to keep fans satisfied. And its not all talk since Calvins is the sort of place where the staff enjoys a spontaneous dance break. Not every gag lands and the effort to feature as many familiar characters as possible -- including Anthony Andersons J.D. now running a food-truck business dubbed ""Gangsta Grub"" -- feels strained. But despite its being more than a little rough around the edges Barbershop The Next Cut has an underlying sweetness thats hard to resist. Taking over the directorial chores Malcolm D. Lee demonstrates the same skill with large ensembles that he did on the Best Man films. The characters in this film seem to really like and care for each other and audience members are bound to share their affection. Distributor Warner Bros.

After all the other long-deferred sequels that have come and gone this year (""Zoolander 2"" ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2"" ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Snore of Destiny"" or whatever) ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" cant help but feel like a model of form durability and purpose. Thats not bad for what is essentially a serving of warmed-over cinematic comfort food -- then again comfort may be the wrong word in light of all the violence erupting outside this longtime Chicago neighborhood hangout the bullets flying almost as quickly as the ever-spirited verbal volleys hurled by Ice Cube Cedric the Entertainer and a fresh cast of coed cutters and stylists. Blending real-world topicality and battle-of-the-sexes playfulness in a way that may remind some of Spike Lees ""Chi-Raq"" but in a much more familiar and crowd-pleasing franchise mold this overly earnest but not-unwelcome third entry should land in the same double-digit domestic B.O. bracket as its 2002 and 2004 predecessors. As functionally directed by Malcolm D. Lee (of ""The Best Man"" movies) ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" retains the lively yet stagebound feel of its workplace-comedy predecessors (including 2005s Queen Latifah-starring spinoff ""Beauty Shop""). Despite the occasional cutaways to homes schools and other outside locations the movie derives its energy almost entirely from the bristling quality of the dialogue and the easy ensemble flow of the performances; its no knock to note that we could at times be watching a play -- or for that matter a TV series not unlike the short-lived ""Barbershop"" sitcom that starred Omar Gooding in the Ice Cube role. Twelve years after we last saw him Cubes gruff good-hearted Calvin Palmer now shares his South Side establishment with a beauty salon operated by his business partner Angie (Regina Hall) -- a necessary cost-cutting measure that has altered the dynamics of the place considerably. Once a neighborhood refuge where a guy could say whatever he pleased in the company of other brothers the barbershop has since become ground zero in a playful ongoing gender war where the women routinely deflate the mens sexual boasts and the men mock the women for spending so much money on their weaves. The beautification of women of course has always been a costly but mutually satisfying arrangement ""Men are visual"" one barber notes and the movie duly proves the point -- and backslaps its primary audience -- by subjecting several of the actresses to ogle-cam closeups. The witty dissection of sexual and relational mores has long been a staple of the franchise and much of the movie hinges on a predictably soapy turn involving longtime haircutter Terri (Eve) and her barber husband Rashad (Common solid if stolid) who becomes the object of an attempted seduction by another co-worker Draya (Nicki Minaj pouty perfection). Carrying on an altogether subtler flirtation are Jerrod (Lamorne Morris) whos nerdy sensitive and tired of being mistaken for gay and Bree (Margot Bingham) an underwritten character who shares Jerrods penchant for the road less traveled and the booty less tapped. But ""Barbershop The Next Cut"" as written by Kenya Barris (""Black-ish"") and Tracy Oliver also has graver matters on its mind. With black-on-black violence continually on the rise and news of a gang shooting in the vicinity almost every day much of the banter wild and free-flowing as it is feels more sobering and instructive than usual. The irreverent glee with which Cedric the Entertainer once dropped a line like ""F--k Jesse Jackson"" has been tempered by a more respectful less provocative impulse perhaps signaled by the visible graying and receding of the still-energetic actors mop. The names of Trayvon Martin Michael Brown and Tamir Rice are dropped with dutiful solemnity and while there is an obligatory jab at Bill Cosby and one saucy POTUS-themed punchline (""Barack has definitely got bitches"") the script also veers into a more pointed debate about whether the nations first black commander-in-chief has done enough to address the persecutions of the African-American community. Its a measure of the movies generosity of spirit that the definition of that community is elastic enough to include a white ex-barber Isaac (series regular Troy Garity back for a short scene) as well as an Indian-American cutter named Raja (Utkarsh Ambudkar) whos accepted as an honorary brother even if he does vote Republican. The story here involves politics on a more local scale. Another ex-barber the upwardly mobile Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas) stops by to inform everyone of a bill that if passed would call for the closure of several South Side streets -- an attempt to contain the ongoing violence that would also have a crippling effect on the business. It wouldnt be a ""Barbershop"" movie of course if the salon didnt come under threat and Calvin and company quickly spring into action offering free haircuts during a weekend-long hashtag-friendly ""ceasefire"" that will hopefully re-establish the barbershop as an oasis of peace and community. As contrived plot turns go its much more involving than the plight of Calvins adolescent son Jalen (Michael Rainey Jr.) -- who partly under the questionable influence of Rashads son Kenny (Diallo Thompson) is about to be initiated into a gang. The ensuing scenes of domestic father-son conflict -- and one egregiously manipulative bit involving an innocent young bystander -- are the pictures most melodramatic and least convincing not least because they steer this raucous sentimental neighborhood comedy in the wearying direction of an Afterschool Special. Granted the underlying thrust of the ""Barbershop"" movies has always been educational These films may provide black viewers with a necessary measure of affirmation identification and catharsis but for the rest of us they can open a mainstream-friendly window into different ways of seeing and more importantly hearing one another. Still its easier to absorb ideas that are being hurled across a crowded public arena rather than being delivered sternly from a lectern. Father Calvin may indeed know best but in those moments its not just Jalen who may feel like hes being treated like a child; when the kid finally gets his dreadlocks trimmed -- well lets just say the concept of an upbraiding has never seemed more literal.

GO SEE IT Reply John Miller says April 12 2016 at 820 pm Rich African-Americans like Ice Cube etc. would do better to spend their tons of money actually helping those in need instead of using attempted-police-killers like Michael Brown as idols or blaming Obama for their races ills.
