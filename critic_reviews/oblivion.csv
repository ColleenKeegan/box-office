UNIVERSAL PICTURES By MICHAEL SRAGOW / ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF This film publicity image released by Universal Pictures shows Tom Cruise in a scene from ""Oblivion."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures)   AP OblivionStarring Tom Cruise Olga Kurylenko Andrea Riseborough Morgan Freeman and Melissa Leo Behind the scenes Directed by Joseph Kosinski Rating PG-13 for sci-fi action violence brief strong language and some sensuality/nudity Running time Two hours five minutes Playing Opens late on April 18 throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitThe mysteries arent as mysterious as they should be in this sci-fi thriller starring Tom Cruise as a tech specialist whos salvaging whats left of Earths natural resources after a catastrophic war with aliens. Grade C+ ""Oblivion"" starts out as a last-man-on-earth film but soon becomes a game of ""Whats wrong with this picture?"" By the time you know all the answers youre wondering what went wrong with the movie. Although it looks spectacular and boasts some pungent ideas the surprise-to-running-time ratio is out of whack. Tom Cruise acts more relaxed than usual as Jack Harper Tech 49 the post-apocalyptic grease monkey who narrates the film. He tells us that after earthlings beat off an invasion from alien ""Scavengers"" (or just plain ""Scavs"") Jack and the awesomely efficient Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) were dispatched to run an epic salvage job from a glittering condo in the clouds. They live in what must be the highest-rent district of the atmosphere somewhere over the ruins of Manhattan. You see the good guys won the war but lost the planet. After the Scavs cleverly wrecked the moon catalyzing natural disasters the humans went nuclear destroying what was left of the environment. Under the orders of their mission commander Sally (Melissa Leo) Jack and Victoria maintain ""hydro-rigs"" that suck up the planets water for relocation to Titan the largest moon of Saturn and the new home for Earths population. With Victoria running the communications desk Jack roams the Eastern seaboard in a ""bubble ship"" that resembles a souped-up weaponized whirlybird. He rescues and repairs deadly flying drones that protect the hydro-rigs from whats left of the Scavs. The drones murder any Scavs they cast their digital eyes on. The war between Scavs and humans sounds like a valid description of what we see before our eyes but you may have your doubts within minutes. Director Joseph Kosinski and his co-writers (William Monahan Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt) try to play fair with the audience but tip their hands too quickly. Jack and Victoria are supposed to have had their memories wiped clean. But Jack gets recurring visions or dreams of Old New York including meeting a woman (Olga Kurylenko) at the Empire State building. He vents his inexplicable nostalgia by covertly building a lakeside cabin where he dons a flannel shirt and a Yankees cap listens to classic rock on vinyl (Led Zeppelin and Procol Harum) and keeps a library of rescued books. (It includes ""A Tale of Two Cities"" - this film is weighted with Sydney Carton-like sacrificial gestures.) When Jack finds a new-grown flower and brings it back to base in a tin can were not shocked that Victoria tosses it out blaming her fear of toxins. Riseborough plays her as an eerie vision of perfection almost preternaturally precise. We know theres something off about Victoria we just dont know what. She responds as if brainwashed to commander Sallys daily question ""Are you an effective team?"" With so few characters on hand its a mistake for a tricky screenplay to plant so many clues early on. Not even dandy shoot-outs and breathtaking vistas can distract you from figuring out their general motivations. The oh-so-gradual revelations hem in the actors. Morgan Freeman brings his usual charismatic gravitas to the second half of the picture but the movies secret acting weapon all along is Leo as Sally. Leo turns an unflappable image and a coaxing voice into an insidious goading presence on Victorias console. This performers gutsiness has a way of conjuring hidden dimensions in the most limited parts like the investigator in last years ""Flight."" She brings a touch of grit to well oiled machines. We should respond to the mysteries-within-mysteries of ""Oblivion"" with the delight of children opening a stack of Russian nesting dolls. Sadly the film lacks the necessary brilliance or grace or spark of originality. Sci-fi zealots might find it fun to count off the references to ""La Jetee"" ""Planet of the Apes"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back."" But even they might consider this films use of music heavy-handed. The score by the chic French electronic band M83 keeps thudding away; Kosinski lathers it on as if in a panic about holding our interest. In one chase scene the pounding stops just long enough for Jack to ask his passenger ""You OK?"" The audience is not OK. Its an art crime that a film so pretty to watch is such hell on the ears.

"Beautiful Oblivion << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Hes Jeremy Lin. Im Chris Tang.  Next Tim Tebows E-mail Hacked Courtesy of Universal Facebook Twitter Print Celebrities Beautiful Oblivion Tom Cruises latest and the problems with modern sci-fi by Wesley Morris on April 18 2013 It takes more than an hour for Oblivion to become whatever it is the filmmakers think its supposed to be. But when that whatever arrives (and even before it does) the movie works as an experience that glorifies the megaplex ideal. I watched it in a very good IMAX theater in suburban Philadelphia that like all IMAX theaters had a guardrail sitting at the bottom of the screen. It seemed to be there expressly to prevent you from entering one of Tom Cruises pores. Fully overwhelmed in IMAX might be the only way to watch this movie. Its been shot with a crispness that elevates the heart rate. Projected at that scale you want to leave your seat and explore this postnuclear Earth to walk the films sands and marvel at the manner in which the geological table has been so fantastically upended that Manhattan erodes beneath dunes and decays at the base of canyons. (The year is 2073.) Oblivion oscillates between sites that are way up high and locations that are way down low between the astral dark of outer space and the flashlit dankness of long-abandoned caves. Even at IMAX scale it remains thrillingly impossible to detect whether the orb-like drones that accompany Jack Harper the wistful repairman Cruise plays have true tactility or whether theyre just projections from a hard drive. The drones perform surveillance theyre armed to the teeth and their resemblance to eyeballs is a clever formal manifestation of their function which is to hunt and exterminate aliens for an ominous entity called the Tet whose twangy operations commander Sally is played by a scratchy video uplink of Melissa Leo. The orbs have a rapport with Jack that gives you that Blade Runner replicant feeling about him. They break; he fixes them. When Jack and by extension the orbs happen upon a tiny survivalist civilization of human rebels -- theyre the ""aliens"" and theyre called Scavs -- the orbs descend and instigate a fantastic firefight. Tremendous care has gone into making you believe that the orbs are whizzing around flying into beams and machine-gunning everyone. No matter its actual provenance this ruined and depopulated Earth often feels breathtakingly real. But theres too much time to realize that what Oblivion cares about most is how good it looks. The director and cowriter Joseph Kosinski is a trained architect and visual-effects designer who wrote the graphic novel that became this movie. His expertise is in vastness and scale. He knows how to fill the camera frame and can orchestrate chaos and elaborate movement so that your ability to follow it is simple and your nervous systems response to its intensity is involuntary. His meticulousness is as painstaking as it was in Tron Legacy another grand optical illusion that kept confusing commercial vanity with philosophical wonder. There he made light something you want to lick and wear and put inside you. Oblivion is something you want to be inside of. Upon entry youd have plenty of room to notice how hollow it is. Kosinski devotes the first hour to setting up Jacks workaday life. He lives atop a single-unit tower on Earth and wakes up with his English assistant and maybe-girlfriend Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) -- because this is also a Tom Cruise movie the studio is almost contractually obligated to let him do this waking shirtlessly. Jack hops into his high-tech jet craft and sets out to repair drones. He visits a cabin from his pre-apocalypse life. Hes nearly captured by mysterious forces far underground in what looks a lot like the New York Public Library. He discovers a woman (Olga Kurylenko) in NASA gear who could be his remnant wife and he is discovered by the Scavs a race of impossibly chic renegades (so much strategically placed rubber So many paramilitary knits) whose leader is Morgan Freeman an actor whos never needed to look cool. But in a cape and a pair of steampunk sunglasses he now looks like hes waiting to make the Mothership Connection. The Scavs need Jack to help them strike back against the Tet and poor Jack has no idea what to do. There are three problems with this setup. The first is that it takes too long to get to striking back. Watching Jack and Victoria pass the time with her communicating with Sally and him roving for drones is not as interesting as Kosinski believes. You need soulfulness for these sorts of longueurs not math or circuitry. The second is that the business with Mrs. Harper is confusing more than it is intriguing The Tet has wiped Jacks memory; but what he does remember of her and of Manhattan is generic placeholder stuff like the photo that comes with a picture frame. This of course leads to the third problem Kosinski might have heightened senses of sound and vision but hes got no feel for interesting people. The ominous humanness the drones achieve -- along with the repeated sight of the iconic coin-ooperated viewfinder on the observation deck of the now-trashed Empire State Building -- is the most interesting surprise in this movie. This is science fiction with state-of-the-art production and sound design smart if absurdly fashionable costumes boundless cinematography and eventually Morgan Freeman. But for all the time and care and money that went into the physical details its astonishing so little ostensible attention was paid to writing an equally well-realized movie. Kosinksi is a filmmaker of the Christopher Nolan mold -- a pop-art engineer. Theyre both shallow and anti-psychological but Nolan has a rippling shallowness; he can skim a rock across the surface of a puddle. He can do a lot with superficiality and genericness. Kosinski doesnt appear to be up to anything. The use of drones that hunt in caves for people who are rumored to be aliens doesnt have enough development to achieve the full weight of allegory. The Tet is a giant game piece thats been designed in a way that resembles the old Viacom logo and shares a name with a Vietnamese holiday -- and the deadly Vietcong military campaign that happened on that day. But it has a womans voice and opens and closes crypto-vaginally. But only for Cruise which must be a metaphor for something. (The movie does some other comical flirting with misogyny too.) Cruise is his reliable self. His determination to give us our moneys worth might represent the most intense and intensely ridiculous professional commitment in the history of the movies. Its hard not to love a man who loves us as much as Cruise does. He just has no chemistry with anyone else. Kurylenko is a beauty but she brings with her a Bond-girlishness that has little to do with Cruise (shes currently being better used opposite Ben Affleck in Terrence Malicks To the Wonder). And in IMAX you fear that in the Hollywood constellation her exoticness might be a redundancy -- that she might be Catherine Zeta-Cotillard. More important is that Cruise is not the sort of star who can keep you rapt just bobbing around ruins and being a kind of average. This might be where the Charlton Hestons and Will Smiths of the world have him beat. Going less than 15 miles an hour diminishes Cruises power. At this point it no longer makes sense for him to keep making science fiction movies anyway. He still looks naturally 30. He is science fiction. The arrivals of Mrs. Harper and the Scavs threaten to take the movie somewhere interesting. For one thing Victoria frigidly freaks out into a way that takes full advantage of Riseboroughs insinuating attentiveness. But then the characters begin doubling and time seems to fold in on itself only so that the audience can go home in a state of satisfied confusion instead of scratching its head in bewildered misery. Kosinski deploys the most banal emblems. At one point two characters stare at Andrew Wyeths Christinas World -- the painting in which a young woman sits at the bottom of a hillock and gazes with her back to us at a distant house -- and one says the painting reminds her of home. What does she mean? Its like staring at a glass of water and saying it reminds you of being wet. That kind of flatfooted cultural imagination pervades the whole movie. Jack goes to that cabin and puts on a Yankees cap which in some corners of the universe might signify the opposite of humanity. Later at the cabin Mrs. Harper puts on a record intended to mean a lot to Jack Its ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" which has shown up in so many movies and commercials that it no longer means anything to us. Oblivion is so much like and influenced by so many other movies that it doesnt top or transcend -- The Matrix I Am Legend Planet of the Apes Star Wars Aliens Vertigo Cloud Atlas Inception An Affair to Remember. Kosinski rejects the wondrous foreboding of 2001 or WALL-E. Oblivion sells the bogus upside of doom. Theres also a desert sequence that bring back sleepy memories of last years John Carter and how this could have been Jack Harper but Kosinski really does have a talent for hypnotizing you with production. This is what John Carter could have been and yet Oblivion could have been so much more. Kosinski doesnt build a new world. Hes just reupholstered a bunch of old ones.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review Tom Cruise in Oblivion Drones and Clones on Planet Earth One of Hollywoods last stars wins battles against enemy spacecraft but he cant infuse this artsy sci-fi film with emotional vitality By Richard Corliss April 19 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle David James / Universal Studios Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Earth 2077. Sixty years earlier alien invaders had blown up our moon and an intergalactic battle ensued. ""We won the war but lost the planet"" says Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) a kind of grease-monkey pilot whose job is to repair the drones that monitor desolate Earth while the rest of humanity lives in a remote space station. His coworker and assigned girlfriend Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) directs Jacks flying sorties over the wreckage of Manhattan which may literally be a no-mans land. Yet as he lies in bed with Victoria Jack has visions of another mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko) from his fantasies or his past. ""I know you but weve never met. Im with you and I dont know your name. I know Im dreaming but it feels like more that. It feels like a memory. How can that be?"" And how is it that science-fiction films imagine the worst for our future while steeped in love-loss for our past? Perhaps because the genre blossomed as literature and then cinema in the late 1940s -- the time of the Cold War and the first nuclear age -- when our worlds two great powers played a deadly game of mutually assured destruction and when fearing the prospect of human extinction was not paranoia just common sense. Its no wonder that any time before the Bomb seemed Edenic to sci-fi writers readers and movigoers; any time after might spell The End. (SEE TIMEs Top 10 Sci-Fi Movies of the 1950s) The same warm ache of nostalgia envelops the Jack of 2077 the hero of Joseph Kosinskis oh-so-serious Oblivion for the pre-invasion Earth of 2017. He stands at the top of the Empire State Building most of it covered in sand and rubble wanders through the caverns of the New York Public Library on 42nd Street (only eight blocks away from King Kongs final perch but miraculously not buried) and patrols Yankee Stadium scene of the very last World Series. He saves old books a catchers mitt and baseball and some LPs from the 1960s and 70s; Procol Harum keeps playing on his internal iTunes. Fixating on the 1948 Andrew Wyeth painting Christinas World and on his dream girl Jack finds a verdant interior life in this wasteland by mixing memory and desire. His poetic guide though is not Eliot but Macaulay whose famous couplet in The Lays of Ancient Rome -- ""And how can man die better than facing fearful odds / For the ashes of his fathers and the temples of his Gods..."" -- haunts Jack like a long-ago pop tune or a distant battle cry. Oblivion must be the only science-fiction film that borrows substantially from I Am Legend WALL-E and Sleepless in Seattle -- itself a remake of 1957s An Affair to Remember which was a remake of 1939s Love Affair. In fact everything in this movie keeps looking backward. Victoria warns Jack that ""Our job is to not remember. Remember?"" Thats the cue for this company man with a rebellious streak to find his future in the past to decide if hes fishing for  memory or waking up inside of a dream. Jack must attend to the dual meaning of ""oblivion"" ""nothing"" and ""forgetfulness."" If weve misplaced our memories weve lost ourselves. (READ Corliss review of the Will Smith I Am Legend) The movies trailer and poster have alerted viewers that Jack and Victoria are not alone on Earth. Morgan Freeman briefly emerges from the underworld as a Zeus-Hades insurgent sporting sunglasses and chomping on a cigar. (Whered he find that -- in a subterranean smoke shop?) Melissa Leo with a fake-syrupy Southern accent is seen on Riseboroughs screen as a mid-level operative back at Mission Control. And Kurylenko also in theaters now as Ben Afflecks whirling wife in Terrence Malicks To the Wonder eventually shows up in person when Jack rescues her from a shot-down spaceship on which she had taken a long cryogenic nap. (No surprise she looks great.) But Oblivion is still so underpopulated that. when Jack requires a suitable rival for a bare-knuckles fight its a clone of himself. (READ Corlisss review of To the Wonder) Kosinski the 3-D graphics whiz who has a Masters degree in architecture from Columbia University made his feature-film debut with the 2010 Tron Legacy (a sequel-remake that also hopscotches through time). Oblivion shows that Kosinski certainly has an eye for spiffy shapes -- the sleek watchtower the collapsible metallic grandeur of Jacks aircraft the platoon of drones with one glowering red eye and the frowny face of a Pac-man goblin-- amid a ravishingly barren landscape. Indeed the juggling of opposites is this directors game to make an artistic statement while indulging his stars need to be a Top Gun aerial ace a moto-bike demon and an old-fashioned romantic swain. (READ Mary Pols review of Tron Legacy) Cruise nearly carries it off. At 50 with a few becoming facial creases but also looking cryogenically preserved he is still the boyish action star a perpetual-motion machine whos been told No so many times hes stopped listening and leaped into the enthralling unknown. The extreme closeups that find only generic worry in Riseboroughs face are kind to Cruise; he instinctively knows how to communicate to an audience through a possibly thoughtful stare. (We havent seen the old-young smiling Tom on the big screen for ages; hes taken Will Smiths lead and traded in his trademark grin for a world-weary grimace.) After playing the dessicated Stacee Jaxx in Rock of Ages and the hobo sleuth in Jack Reacher Cruise completes his Jack trilogy as Harper spelunking inside the crevices of his memory or fantasy. (READ Corliss on Tom Cruise in Rock of Ages and Jack Reacher) The exigencies of Cruises participation demand fights and flights. We get one pretty cool space dogfight as Jack plays bumper cars with a flotilla of enemy aircraft and one lame one thats way too reminiscent of and less thrilling than the climactic chase in the original Star Wars. Rule for sci-fi directors No more aerial Indy 500-style battles in narrow canyons. But the biggest collision in Oblivion -- one Kosinski may not have intended -- is between the feverish action scenes and the slowness we might say torpor of the rest of the film. For all the shouting and swooning characters dont connect; and by the end when all the clones and drones are accounted for science-fiction entropy has given way to audience ennui. Six minutes or 60 years after seeing the movie viewers are unlikely to remember it. In space Jack hopes someone may hear you dream. But in a movie theater no one will see you yawn.

Oblivion is like that movie-within-a-movie Everything in it feels 100 percent inauthentic. That vibe as it happens turns out to be intentional. But when the humans arrive its still a narcotic. The pity is that the film is about the war to liberate the human spirit from alien soul-snuffing exploiters and that Cruise is supposed to be our last best hope. In the long opening voice-over his character Jack (not Reacher) explains that ""Scavengers"" obliterated humankind They blew up the moon and Nature did the rest. Humans beat the invaders back and then took off en masse to colonize a moon of Saturn Titan. But a few people stayed behind to harvest the remaining resources and watch out for leftover ""Scavs."" Jack is teamed with a Brit named Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) who sits in a giant mushroomlike flight tower reading data from ""hydro rigs"" and lethal drones. He flies around doing repairs and calling in those drones whenever there are signs of saboteurs. He also tells us that his memory has been wiped so that he wont spill any beans if grabbed by Scavs. Director Joseph Kosinski (Tron Legacy) thinks big -- big white impersonal settings on a big barren landscape under a big fractured moon with one big segment broken off and simply hanging suspended in orbit with a trail of little pieces floating around. But the sets just sit there. The first half-hour is Jack talking to Victoria on his headset Jack fixing rigs and Jack having sex with the eager-beaver Victoria. (Wow does she want him.) They talk longingly of their imminent departure for Titan. Victoria speaks to an administrator on a screen called Sally (Melissa Leo). These scenes exert a strange fascination Theyre so conscientiously neutral so droningly dull that they almost pass for Stanley Kubrick-like. But Jack shares our boredom. He feels dislocated. He has visions of himself atop the Empire State Building with another woman -- someone more compelling than his vaguely robotic partner. Someone played by Olga Kurylenko this years comely avatar of spirituality. When Jack finds a crashed spaceship with human passengers (including Olga) in suspended animation and a drone flies in and starts blasting them hes flummoxed. Drones are supposed to kill Scavs not humans And certainly not Olga Eventually Jack is captured by beings who look like humans (but you never know) led by Morgan Freeman who puffs happily on a cigar -- and you would too if you had to do as little for a paycheck this size. He says he was intrigued when Jack found a book with a poem by Macaulay in which three Romans sacrifice themselves to save their city. Thats when things get murky. I eventually figured out Oblivion but not while watching it. While watching it I said ""What? What?"" over the din of the explosions. It was Wikipedias Oblivion entry that spelled out what was happening in the final flashback. And some but not all of my questions were answered on an IMDb board in which posters argued over whether the problem was our lack of attention spans or atrocious screenwriting. I have honed my attention span on three-hour Romanian pictures and the oeuvre of Tarkovsky and Tarr. My attention span is dandy. Was Cruise trying to beat out fellow Scientologist John Travolta for the honor of starring in the dumbest sci-fi epic ever? Thank heavens he lost -- nothing will ever be as shatteringly inane as the L. Ron Hubbard-based Battlefield Earth. But joining forces with the director of Tron Legacy was like checking ""d"" on the form that said ""I want my space movies more (a) incoherent (b) plodding (c) migraine-inducing or (d) all of the above."" Oblivion spins the same kind of paranoid futuristic fantasy as Battlefield Earth in which a man must learn the true nature of his identity that his body is but a temporary vessel his soul immortal. Only then can he take on an evil empire of plundering anti-individualists from an unnamed planet that sounds like Xenu. Cruise was on a roll for a while with Magnolia and his two Spielberg pictures -- his acting was grounded. But he must be shedding brain cells like wives. After all of these years he still indicates rather than feels signaling thought by wrinkling his brow and squinting real hard and looking like a caveman encountering fire for the first time. He looks less like mankinds savior than like a harbinger of devolution -- the last stage before were back at lungfish.

Reactions to significant events subdued like in reality. No Hollywood Clapping and gratuitous cheering. No intensely angry interchanges. Some doubt as to who is real and who is maybe a subversive being. Do I trust you? Very satisfying capture of the human experience Dennissaid on Monday September 02 2013 14418 AMI liked it. Bought the DVD last week and watched it today. Loved the visuals amp; the soundtrack. It DID help to go back amp; watch a 2nd time with the commentary switched ON. I had originally planned on seeing it in a theater but I think that Will Smith film came out about the same time amp; bombed horribly. That was some sort of sci-fi film featuring his son. Oblivion.....Im VERY glad that I bought the DVD. And....YES I have seen ( amp; forgotten ) Moon. Theres some guy whos been leaving Moon plugs all over any amp; every Oblivion-related YouTube video he could find. Dro Dizzlesaid on Monday September 02 2013 125840 AMI found the movie to be quite interesting but stale at times. I agree with one commenter that this was more product than art. The idea and concept of clones their memories and unexpected crossing of paths has been explored and in more thoughtful ways. I felt the movie took inspiration from many predecessors such as Blade Runner and most especially Moon (with Sam Rockwell I believe one come for asked about clones and souls. Both of these movies explore that concept much better and more beautifully). I felt there also touches of Wall-E and 2001 space odyssey. Then again many movies these days are basically repackaged stories. Nevertheless directors and writers have to find a way to make movies unique. Sadly while this movie was overall entertaining and filled with good performances its direction and overall concept fell short of it being a great Sci-fi film for the ages. I wrote this using a mobile device please excuse any errors. Thanks. Mike Leesaid on Monday August 12 2013 112008 AMNIce job Richard. Its funny how whenever a sci-fi film is being reviewed I miss Roger Ebert so intensely. I still remember the argument about whether the three- legged monstrosities in Spielbergs ""War of the Worlds"" were silly or not. Roger loved sci-fi. And thats why you go see a cover band--because you loved the original and even the echoes are fun Dustinsaid on Sunday August 04 2013 25008 PMRobotello no seriously watch the movie moon. thetileninja said on Thursday June 27 2013 111127 PMPerhaps it was because of my overactive brain and my acute sense of Americas film state as of late but I had a sense that I was watching ""product not art"". Very expensive and well made product like walking into a Lexus dealership and maybe even getting to take a test drive... but left no haunting questions or life affirming epiphanies like good (no... great) sci-fi does and should.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Tom Cruise stars as Jack Harper and Morgan Freeman stars as Malcolm Beech in ""Oblivion."" Story highlights""Oblivion"" is a Tom Cruise sci-fi film; he stars as the last guy on EarthCritic Tom Charity says movie is shot beautifully but doesnt deliverDirector lacks the poetic imagination to animate this requiem Charity saysRemember when the movies held the impending extinction of human life on the planet as a worst-case scenario -- something that could and would be heroically averted if only at the last second? Nowadays the end times are only the beginning an apocalyptic backdrop is something were going to be seeing a lot of this year so we might as well get used to it. In the glossy derivative ambitious and fatally underpowered ""Oblivion"" Tom Cruise is the last guy on Earth. Hes Jack a technician -- a mechanic really -- whose job is to fix broken down drones (in a cute touch he sticks the first one back together with chewing gum). In other words hes a bit like WALL-E and Andrea Riseborough is his latter day Eve. They live in a billion-dollar birdhouse perched up above the clouds and in a quaintly chauvinist set up he reconnoiters the skies in a flashy starfighter prototype while she sits at an interstellar telephone exchange and relays the commands of mission controller Sally (an irritatingly twangy Melissa Leo) from on high. See the remainder of the human race has taken refuge on a giant spaceship (it looks like a floating audio speaker something that wouldnt be out of place on the cover of an 80s progressive rock album). The plan is to scoot over to Saturn just as soon as they have sucked up enough hydropower from the Earths oceans to fuel the journey. But why? Well because of the alien invaders who destroyed the moon and threw the biosphere out of whack thats why. As Cruise mournfully intones in the movies lugubrious prologue we won the war but lost the planet.JUST WATCHEDTom Cruise and Morgan Freemans bromanceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTom Cruise and Morgan Freemans bromance 0154JUST WATCHEDTom Cruise denies talking about divorceReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTom Cruise denies talking about divorce 0141Thats what the drones are for to kill off the last remaining hostiles or ""scavs"" who have taken refuge on the edge of the radioactive wastelands that cover most of the globe. Thats more than enough backstory I know but theres much more to come out even as Jack goes about his daily routine tracking down lost drones revisiting ruined New York landmarks (the top of the Empire State Building now sits at ground level on a sea of dust) and occasionally going AWOL himself to grapple with fragmentary memories of a beautiful girl (Olga Kurylenko) and a lost world he has no right to remember. The story is officially credited to an unpublished comic book by the films director Joseph Kosinski. But if you poured all the most memorable sci-fi films from the past half century into a blender from ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and the original ""Planet of the Apes"" all the way down to last years ""Prometheus"" you would probably wind up with something very similar and equally synthetic -- though quite possibly more exciting. While he immerses us in an often dazzling futurescape for the most part Kosinski (""Tron Legacy"") lacks the poetic imagination to animate this requiem for a dying world -- comparisons with ""WALL-E"" are certainly not to this films advantage -- and fails to convince us that he genuinely cares about the fate of his characters let alone the planet. The movies few action scenes are competent but unlikely to wow any battle-seasoned gamers out there. Kosinski does produce one rabbit from his hat a real surprise late in the game that sends the movie for a loop but also undermines a good deal of the credibility hes worked hard to build up over the preceding hour and a half or so. Like ""Prometheus"" this is another of those earnest overdetermined spiritual allegories that falls apart in the rear-view mirror. It is certainly nice to look at though. Director of photography Claudio Miranda was last seen picking up an Academy Award for his breathtaking work on ""Life of Pi"" and his images of an Earth turned to ash are almost as alluring. Theyre enough to lend the picture a sense of scope and even grandeur but they cant paper over the cracks running right through its core. ""Oblivion"" shoots for the moon and falls short.Powered by LivefyreHomeU.S.Crime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle East2016 ElectionWashingtonNationWorldMarketsTechMediaPersonal FinanceLuxuryOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthDiet + FitnessLiving WellParenting + FamilyEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationFashionDesignArchitectureAutosLuxuryTravelBest of TravelSleeps + EatsBusiness TravelAviation + BeyondPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerLivingFoodRelationshipsReligionVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZMore...PhotosLongformInvestigationsiReportCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersU.S. EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

The story eventually devolves into a grab bag of sci-fi tropes--time travel doppelgangers government perfidy roving bands of human survivalists--but as with so many other Cruise productions the sheer scale of everything is so mind-numbing that you may not notice.

Thats certainly true of ""Oblivion"" the sly surprising and visually magnificent Tom Cruise vehicle that has forced me - and many other people I suspect - to revise my first opinion of director Joseph Kosinski. In fact on some bizarre level ""Oblivion"" feels like a more grown-up and vastly improved version of Kosinskis murky and ludicrous ""TRON Legacy"" a movie I compared to sticking your head into a barrel of ink full of fluorescent glow-sticks.Like that movie ""Oblivion"" incorporates all sorts of themes ideas and images from science-fiction cinema of the last several decades including ""Blade Runner"" ""The Matrix"" ""Total Recall"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" and Andrei Tarkovskys ""Solaris"" among others. It explores nearly the same territory of loss loneliness and rediscovery but the philosophical veneer and the reverent design aesthetic fit a whole lot better when the whole story doesnt take place inside a 1980s video game. Im sure some people will see ""Oblivion"" as another Philip K. Dick rehash -- to be clear its not based on any of his material -- but to my mind Kosinski and co-writers Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt have synthesized all these influences into a witty and elegant post-apocalyptic parable thats well suited to our age of asymmetrical warfare and even asymmetrical reality. (One could indeed steer a discussion of ""Oblivion"" toward a discussion of the limits of political knowledge and global understanding - but not before youve seen the movie.)We begin on or just above the surface of an abandoned and nearly dead planet which happens to be our beloved third rock from the sun. Its the 2070s and Jack (Cruise) our hero explains in an opening voice-over that some years earlier the human race fought a total war against an alien race known as the Scavs. These invaders had first blown up the Moon - and indeed we can see it a horizontal streak of rubble across the sky -- wreaking havoc with the tides and immensely destructive changes in the climate. While the Scav invasion was eventually repelled the victory required the use of most of Earths nuclear arsenal leaving most of the planet uninhabitable. Most surviving humans have apparently been airlifted to a gigantic triangular spacecraft called the Tet where they await evacuation to Titan Saturns largest moon to begin a new civilization.Jack and Victoria (the chilly leggy Andrea Riseborough) whos both his co-worker and his sexual partner are technicians posted to a sleek chic sky-pod that doubles as command center and living quarters - think Le Corbusier plus a 1979 layout from Architectural Digest plus Playboy magazine - mounted on a pole a few hundred meters above the Earths surface. Theyre only there on a short-term assignment mostly to monitor and repair the drones who hunt down bands of surviving Scavs and protect the giant nuclear reactors that suck up seawater and send power to the Tet. Victoria and Jack both know theyve had their previous memories wiped so that if theyre captured by the Scavs they cant reveal any important operating info about the Tet. But Jack has started having peculiar dreams and fragments of memory seemingly from a prewar Earth society he isnt old enough to remember.So we know from the very first scene that somethings wrong with this picture. But Kosinski takes his time with this resplendent vision of massive desolation and isolated luxury slowly building an atmosphere of menace uncertainty and even sadness. Even aspects of the film that seem arbitrary or poorly thought-out (why does Victoria get dolled up in skirt and heels to man a communications console?) come into focus eventually. As Jack patrols the awe-inspiring and sometimes heartbreaking landscape of a devastated planet - which recalls the ""Planet of the Apes"" movies to be sure but also Stephen Vincent Benets classic short story ""By the Waters of Babylon"" - ""Oblivion"" veers awfully close to the contemplative mode especially for a Hollywood spectacle that reportedly cost more than 100 million. I mean that as high praise and Claudio Mirandas photography and the magnificent retro-moderne production design of Darren Gilford are well worth contemplation. But its likely some viewers will become impatient for the plot to kick into gear and the action scenes to cut loose. You Might Also Like In due course they do - but theres a limited amount I can tell you about that. Adapting his own graphic novel (originally written with Arvid Nelson) Kosinski handles the flow of information in ""Oblivion"" with confidence. We realize from the outset that Jacks dreams and memories reflect some underlying reality and that he and Victoria dont understand the whole story of the Tet and the Scavs and the war. And its obvious that Sally (Melissa Leo) the chatty-bossy hardass Southern belle who talks to them from the Tet knows a great deal more than shes telling them. Still even after Jack rescues Julia (Olga Kurylenko) the lone survivor of a crashed spacecraft whose crew has been in suspended animation for decades and learns some surprising facts about her mission you still wont put it all together. Since every poster for this movie has Morgan Freeman in it Im probably OK saying that he and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (of ""Game of Thrones"") show up as the leaders of a renegade band of humans - and that they and Julia arent the only living people Jack finds on the planet. If a lot of the second half of ""Oblivion"" is fairly standard action cinema - a guy and a girl on the run and looking for answers - their setting and situation is always visually striking. Whatever you make of Tom Cruise as a person or personality he has a sharp eye for material and understands his own limits; in the last couple of years hes homed in on playing the iconic Troubled Guy Who Knows Too Much. This is at least the third strong Cruise performance in a row after ""Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol"" and ""Jack Reacher"" (hell lets throw in ""Knight and Day"" even though it wasnt a hit).Is it possible or plausible that the metaphorical David vs. Goliath level of ""Oblivion"" will strike some deep cultural and political chord the way the Wachowskis did in 1999 with the first ""Matrix""? Not really - that layer of the movie is in there for those who yearn for it but ""Oblivion"" is a much cooler movie temperature-wise not bursting with ideas in quite the same way and much more a visual tribute to the world of Tarkovsky and R.W. Fassbinder. ""Oblivion"" is a technical triumph rather than a philosophical breakthrough demonstrating how beautifully digital effects can be blended with real people and real sets demonstrating that neither Tom Cruise nor the 1970s will ever die and announcing the unexpected arrival of a major science-fiction director.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 19 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 19 2013 1157AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Joseph Kosinski Written by Joseph Kosinski William Monahan Karl Gajdusek Michael Arndt Starring Tom Cruise Andrea Riseborough Olga Kurylenko Classification PG Genre scifi Year 2013 Country USA Language English Blockbuster movies like the stars who populate them really have only one obligation first last and foremost to look good. Increasingly a lavish look is all that the big screen is selling how it has chosen to distinguish itself from those smaller and smarter screens. Sure if the spectacle happens to come with the semblance of a script the pretty head with the hint of a brain so much the better. Thats nice just no longer necessary. Multimedia Oblivion The official trailer Now lets apply these lofty standards to this early extravaganza of the season. Oblivion has got a pretty good look a sterile beauty yet beauty nonetheless. IQ-wise its even got that semblance and that hint no more but we cant be greedy. And its got Tom Cruise hardly the star or the hunk he once was yet still constellation-worthy. What it hasnt got is much action and virtually none of the numbingly loud brand beloved by the genre; however to these ears at least that absence plays like a blessed presence. So the final tally isnt hard to tote Oblivion is an okay blockbuster a multimillion-dollar exercise in competence.The antiseptic beauty is courtesy of director Joseph Kosinksi who proved his CGI chops in Tron Legacy and extends that proof here. A pre-credit spot of exposition sets the futuristic scene. 2077 and the Earth glimpsed from above is a ravaged rock of grey devastation. At some point in the past scavenger aliens destroyed our moon a loss that unleashed a barrage of tsunamis and earthquakes. In the ensuing battle humans vanquished the aliens although the victory proved Pyrrhic. Or as Jack Harper (Cruise) puts it ""We won the war but lost the planet."" That left the victors to retreat to the suburbs of the solar system - Titan on the outskirts of Jupiter - where they currently reside.Stationed above the Earths ruin in a lovely stainless-steel pod (Frank Lloyd Wright meets NASA) Jack is a maintenance guy a one-man ""mop-up crew"" - think Wall-E but without the wit. His job is to play flying visits to the desolate surface on the hunt for any remnant aliens which hes quick to dispatch often aided by a fleet of unmanned drones - giant metal balls with guns. Back up in his home away from home Jack has a missus in Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) who speaks in a proper English accent and dresses very well. And undresses even better when she goes skinny-dipping in the stainless-steel pods stainless-steel pool an event that Kosinksi treats like the Rapture with corresponding Dolbyesque fanfare. Then again Riseborough does look good.The two as theyre fond of telling their smiling dispatcher on Titan are ""an effective team."" Nevertheless unlike his by-the-rules missus Jack has a bit of a rebel streak. Hes fond of wearing an old Yankees cap of retrieving books of Roman poetry from abandoned libraries of venturing off the grid to visit a cottage hideaway in an earthly valley still green and most disconcertingly of entertaining black-and-white flashbacks to a long-ago assignation on the observation deck of the Empire State Building - yes An Affair to Almost Remember.Jacks memory is stoked and the films good looks further amped when an aging spacecraft crash-lands and Olga Kurylenko awakens from a 60-year slumber. Her name is Julia but more important to Jack is her news ""Im your wife."" Trust me up in the pod the missus aint pleased.At this stage Im under strict orders from the studio in question not to ""reveal key plot points."" A good thing too since the key plot points grow downright unfathomable although in the scripts defence the climax does bring a certain clarity. Yet I can safely divulge that especially by spectacle standards the cast is quite sparse - look hard and you might see Morgan Freeman doing his usual noble Morgan Freeman thing. Equally scarce are the villains - the best we get are a bunch of those metal-ball drones flitting about in high dudgeon. Zombies they arent.But again these very absences have an oddly refreshing allure. In the sterility of Oblivion in the paucity of its characters and the vacuum of its spaced-out story theres a kind of serenity. This is a quiet blockbuster devoid of sound and fury but for that precise reason signifying something. What exactly? A functioning mediocrity perhaps blessed with good looks and unassuming with good reason.

Then throws out the good ones. Then makes ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" anyway. The movie is set on Earth rendered nearly uninhabitable after a long war with some alien race called the Scavengers. The Scavs started it off by exploding the moon. We then amped up things with nuclear missiles and well welcome to Armageddon. Now almost all the human survivors have all gone to Saturns moon. But two people stay behind fighting off the remaining Scavs repairing surveillance equipment and maintaining the machines which are draining our oceans for fuel exports. What does this energy project have to do with Saturns moon? Why do the two technicians live in a glamorous pad with an infinity pool and why does the woman work in high heels? Why does a rocket suddenly crash to earth with a crew of retro astronauts and why does the male technician keep having 21st-century flashbacks? Your guess is as good as mine. Actually your guess may be better than mine because half an hour into this mess I began to think of more interesting things. Such as what the hell is that sticky thing on the floor I just stepped in? Also just how strangely secretly revealing is Tom Cruises career? At first Cruise played young men with daddy issues older authority figures whose respect he was trying to win or whose control he was rebelling against. ""Risky Business"" ""Top Gun"" ""Days of Thunder"" ""Cocktail"" ""The Color of Money"" ""The Firm"" -- it was endless and by the time he started to get some crows-feet a little unseemly. Grow up already. So OK he switched to playing slightly older secretive guys who are themselves persecuted by unknown forces. ""Mission Impossible"" was the segue (it had both a deceptive daddy figure and a conspiracy) and the plots soon thickened with ""Eyes Wide Shut"" ""Vanilla Sky"" ""Minority Report"" ""Knight and Day"" and ""Jack Reacher."" And thats been the whole of the arc -- from Daddy Dearest to You Just Say Im Paranoid Because Youre Out To Get Me. Of course maybe the very tightly-wound star does think there are forces out to get him -- just as the son of an abusive father might have once felt an alpha-male gap. But the only times Cruise has connected recently -- in ""Rock of Ages"" and ""Tropic Thunder"" -- have been when he threw all this overboard and showed an unexpected sense of humor. Any wit is lost in space here though as the seriously suspicious save-the-world hunk flies a cool hovercraft hunts Scavs takes a lot of showers and of course does that time-honored Cruise thing of running endlessly pumping his arms and looking determined. Determined to do what though is another question. Theres nothing to really catch our interest here outside of some retro-`70s movie design (the director did the last ""Tron"" movie and fills the soundtrack with the beeps and bleeps of old video games). The landscapes are pretty but there are no people in them. Oh theres Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko -- both of whom scored separately in ""Disconnect"" and ""To the Wonder"" neither of whom register here. Theres Melissa Leo (who literally phones in her performance via video screen) and Morgan Freeman who is -- of course -- terribly wise and avuncular. The audience laughed at him. And that was the only light moment in a movie that combines a lot of different films yet somehow remains less than the sum of its parts as it slowly spirals toward Armageddon II. At the end in desperation they even send in the clones. But honestly? The replicants have been on the scene from the start. Ratings note The film contains brief nudity violence and some strong language. Oblivion (PG-13) Universal (126 min.) Directed by Joseph Kosinski. With Tom Cruise Morgan Freeman Olga Kurylenko.

"Review Tom Cruises Oblivion a sci-fi adventure to remember - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesReview Tom Cruises Oblivion a sci-fi adventure to rememberDirector Joseph Kosinski has created an intricate dystopian story of a devastated Earth for grown-ups with Cruise expertly in control.April 18 2013|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Tom Cruise stars in ""Oblivion."" (David James / Universal...)""Oblivion"" will make you remember not forget.This Tom Cruise vehicle is a throwback to the days when on-screen science fiction was about speculative ideas rather than selling toys to tots a think of it as the most expensive episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" ever made.""Oblivion"" is not perfect. Its dystopian story makes no apologies for its familiarity echoing such films as ""The Planet of the Apes"" ""The Matrix"" ""2001"" and even ""Wall-E."" And expecting the wheels not to eventually begin to fall off its pleasantly complicated head-spinning plot (based on the director Joseph Kosinskis graphic novel) is asking a little too much.But even given all this implausibility ""Oblivion"" has the ability to haunt you visually and with an unanticipated love story even emotionally. Written by Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn this is a piece of futuristic fiction intended for adults not their children a film in which firefights and futuristic weapons feel more like afterthoughts than reasons for being.VIDEO Tom Cruise Joseph Kosinski talk OblivionGiven that the film is set on an Earth 60-plus years in the future a time after an invasion by rapacious aliens (are there any other kind?) has completely devastated the planet were expecting to see ruins aplenty and ""Oblivion"" does not disappoint.Overseen by production designer Darren Gilford and shot by Claudio Miranda whose ""Life of Pi"" experience blending physical components and computer-generated effects stood him in good stead ""Oblivions"" snapshots of CGI devastation are enhanced by being shown against real Icelandic landscapes.Whether it be beached warships the Washington Monument looking like that tower in Pisa or an elaborate re-creation of the wrecked main reading room in the New York Public Librarys Fifth Avenue branch these images linger in the memory after theyve faded from the screen.Director Kosinski (""Tron Legacy"") has an architecture background and it shows in the sleekly futuristic look the film gives to both the highly mobile Bubble ship a combination jet plane and helicopter that looks like a flying can opener and the Skytower a coolly minimalistic residential structure set 3000 feet above the surface of the earth.As important as ""Oblivions"" look is its good fortune in having Cruise in the starring role of Jack Harper. The actor is essential in bringing conviction and credibility to this made-up world and he also expertly handles the huge chunk of voice-over exposition that gets us up to speed in a complicated story.""Oblivion"" starts not with the future but with a black and white dream of Harpers ""Earth before the war New York before I was born."" Its a dream of a woman Harper feels he has some connection with but given that the year is 2077 five years since Harper underwent a ""mandatory memory wipe"" for security purposes hes not surprised that he cant quite figure it out.FULL COVERAGE Film reviewsThe films back story is this that an invading alien force lost the war but so destroyed Earth in the process that all of the planets survivors have moved to Titan one of Jupiters moons. There life is supported by huge fusion reactors on Earth that create energy by relentlessly sucking up seawater.But because remnants of the alien force known as scavengers or scavs remain active on the deserted earth mechanized drones are needed to protect those vital reactors. And because anything mechanized tends to break down human repairmen are essential which is where Jack Harper comes in.Known officially as Technician 49 Harper lives in that Skytower with his navigator Victoria ""Vika"" Olsen (the gifted Andrea Riseborough) who stays in touch via video link with their commanding officer down-home Sally (Melissa Leo always effective). In just two weeks the pair are scheduled to be rotated off Earth and though Vika for one cant wait to leave Harper is not so sure.""Oblivion"" is in no hurry to have its tricky plot unfold and that enables the film to take full advantage of its lonely ""theres nobody out there but us"" scenario. We get to spend a lot of time with this one-man-band as he flies around servicing downed drones far and near on Earths vastness (chewing gum comes in surprisingly handy) and displaying a fondness for the flotsam and jetsam of the planet.Because the spaces are so vast and the people so few ""Oblivion"" unexpectedly plays at times like a chamber drama so the high caliber of the two leads joined later by Morgan Freeman Olga Kurylenko and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is a key factor in how evocative the story becomes.For in typical Rod Serling fashion what starts out simple and straightforward gets increasingly less so as reality-bending plot zigs and zags become the order of the day. More adventurous than your typical Hollywood tent pole ""Oblivion"" makes you remember why science fiction movies pulled you in way back when and didnt let you go.kenneth.turanlatimes.com--------------------------------OblivionMPAA rating PG-13 for sci-fi action violence brief strong language and some sensuality/nudityRunning time 2 hours 5 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE Roger Ebert Career in pictures ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS Greatest box office flops MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESGlendale motorcycle shop created Tom Cruises Oblivion...April 27 2013Tom Cruise proves his box-office worth with No. 1 OblivionApril 21 2013Oblivion Sci-fi pastiche doesnt come together reviews...April 19 2013Tom Cruise will be back on top of box office with OblivionApril 18 2013M83 to score Tom Cruise sci-fi epic OblivionJune 29 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesMovies_nowTom CruiseNot_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-oblivion-20130419,0,2938842.story",200,oblivion13,oblivion,latimes

(Universal Pictures) By Michael OSullivan April 18 2013 ""Oblivion"" looks marvelous in the deliciously dystopian way of so many post-apocalyptic films. Its set in 2077 after alien invaders called Scavengers (or ""Scavs"") have laid waste to our moon leading to cataclysmic floods and earthquakes that have ravaged Earth. The film features gorgeous CGI shots of such broken half-buried landmarks as the Washington Monument and the Empire State Building whose observation deck can now be accessed by walking onto it from a mountain of rubble. Its the kind of film thats perfect for the Imax format in which some theaters are offering it. Just be warned that this means its also very very loud. One joker at a preview screening shouted ""Volume"" as the film was barely getting under way to much laughter. He wasnt complaining that it was too quiet. It ought to look good. The movie by director Joseph Kosinski (""Tron Legacy"") is said to be based on a graphic novel by Kosinski and comic book writer Arvid Nelson. Although that book was never published -- and probably never will be -- the mock-up of the story drew the attention of star Tom Cruise along with not one but two studios. Disney which originally had the rights ultimately gave them up to Universal which made the film. Its an engrossing if complicated and twisty story with plentiful sci-fi action and a provocative subtext about the nature of the human soul. At times however the balance between those two things feels off. Some of the fight sequences which involve robotic flying ""drones"" mounted with guns go on a bit longer than is strictly necessary. Cruise plays Jack Harper a futuristic maintenance man whose dangerous job consists of repairing the drones that patrol Earth an unpopulated wasteland where giant ""hydro rigs"" convert seawater into energy to be used by whats left of the human race which has relocated to a colony on one of Saturns moons. Although weve won the war against the Scavs there are still some left and they like to sabotage the hydro rigs and the drones almost as much as they enjoy trying to kill Jack. He and his partner/lover Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) who provides backup from a command center in the clouds have their work cut out for them but its more routine than glamorous. ""Were the mop-up crew"" Jack says. All is not as it appears however. That scenario as laid out by Jack in voice-over narration soon starts to show cracks. The Scavs terrorist-style activities pick up and a spacecraft loaded with humans in suspended animation crash-lands on Earth drawn by an electronic beacon emanating from the surface. Its suddenly as if the order of Jacks world is turned upside down including his understanding of who the good guys and the bad guys are. Even Jack and Victorias boss Sally (Melissa Leo) who supervises their work from an orbiting satellite called the Tet starts to seem not quite so maternal as she did at the beginning of the film. More important Jack starts to question his own identity; indeed the very nature of identity itself. Its worth noting that although Jack and Victoria underwent mandatory ""memory wipes"" that erased everything they knew before starting these jobs Jack is plagued by strange dreams of a pre-war Earth -- a time when he wouldnt even have been born -- and of a beautiful but mysterious woman (Olga Kurylenko). The films big reveal is satisfying but requires some mental effort. This is not a movie during which you should fall asleep. Fortunately theres not much chance of that. ""Oblivion"" is fast-paced and exciting. As for the elephant in the room it must be said that going to a Tom Cruise movie these days is more complicated than it used to be. The real-world baggage that this sometimes kooky tabloid staple brings to the screen is for many harder to ignore than it is with other movie stars with the possible exception of Lindsay Lohan. That said Cruise makes for a fine and even appealing action hero perhaps because his character is someone without an apparent past. Its as if ""Oblivion"" is inviting us to undergo our own memory wipes before seeing the film. If youre able to forgive and forget ""Oblivion"" isnt a bad place to start loving Tom Cruise all over again. rr 1/2 PG-13. At area theaters.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1009 p.m. EDT April 18 2013An ultra-fit Tom Cruise cant save this stylish but empty adventure.Oblivion starring Tom Cruise dazzles with style but falls short on substance.(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  1/2 out of fourStars Tom Cruise Morgan Freeman Olga Kurylenko Andrea Riseborough Melissa Leo Zoe BellRated PG-13; Runtime 2 hours 6 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideOblivion is a slick spectacle -- seeing the humorless but ultra-fit Tom Cruise wrestle with himself might be worth the price of admission alone.But with the film (  1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) focusing squarely on style substance falls by the post-apocalyptic wayside. Director Joseph Kosinski focuses on cool visuals but stints on a compelling plot. Its a dazzler but the story lacks the impact of the futuristic look.Cruises performance as Jack Harper is the best of the lot but thats because hes given the closest thing to a fully-realized character. The rest of the talented cast might as well be cardboard cutouts.The plots muddled internal logic leaves some substantial holes. But even more dramatically this story of Earth in 2077 loses its way in the films second half. It also is startlingly derivative as Kosinski who directed 2010s TRON Legacy draws from a grab bag of sci-fi predecessors including WALLE Total Recall Planet of the Apes and The Matrix.Still neither the sci-fi or the vague political commentary are involving. And while Cruises character is given two romantic interests (played by Andrea Riseborough and Olga Kurylenko) the actor doesnt connect with either. Its his star vehicle and he runs with it in a way that only the intense actor can.STORY Beyond Bond Olga Kurylenko heads for OblivionVIDEO The secret to Tom Cruises youthful looksMORE The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYWhen we meet Jack Earth is a post-apocalyptic wasteland except for the crumbling ruins of iconic New York buildings and a few off-the-grid verdant sites. Jack zips around in an ultra-mod helicopter. Hes a technician who repairs drones and lives in a minimalist house at the top of a tower with girlfriend/co-worker Victoria (Riseborough). She mans the controls as he flits about looking for malfunctioning drones and lurking ""scavs"" leftover scavengers from the planets destruction some 60 years back.Its Victorias job to check in daily with Mission Control embodied by the frighteningly cheerful chief (Melissa Leo.) Every day after asserting its ""another wonderful day in paradise"" Victoria is asked if she and Jack are still ""an effective team."" Victoria doesnt miss a beat with her chipper assurances.But Jack is not feeling all that effective. Even though he and Victoria had their memories scoured (for security reasons) hes haunted by recurring dreams of a mysterious dark-haired woman. Earth has a powerful pull on Jack. Victoria on the other hand cant wait to join the rest of the human race that has migrated to Titan the largest moon of Saturn. ""Only two more weeks"" she keeps reminding Jack like a movie cop with only a couple weeks left until retirement.Jacks Earth-bound reveries are intensified when he rescues a human survivor (Kurylenko) from crash wreckage.Just as in the Mission Impossible movies War of the Worlds and Top Gun Jack is a classic hero. Hes bent on saving the world and we dont ever doubt that he will. If only he was more complicated and flawed. The biggest complication for him is his relationship with Victoria and his pull toward the woman he saved.Morgan Freeman is always a welcome presence but hes given too little screen time as the leader of an underground human resistance group.When the time comes for the big reveal were almost oblivious since the storys vitality has waned. 30 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 10 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/175xAaw",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/G2SzGdxRL20/?utm_source=feedly,200,oblivion15,oblivion,usatoday

A veteran (Tom Cruise) assigned to extract Earths remaining resources begins to question what he knows about his mission and himself. Also starring Morgan Freeman. (Photo/Video Universal) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com April 18 2013 619 p.m. ET In more ways than one ""Oblivion"" offers a vision of a chilling future. What leaps to the eye most impressively is our planet in ruins decades after an alien invasion so destructive that it shattered the moon. The tops of once-proud landmarks--the Empire State Building the Golden Gate Bridge--still protrude from the rubble evoking the image of the Statue of Liberty at the end of ""Planet of the Apes."" At the same time though this bloated sci-fi adventure with Tom Cruise in a starring role suggests a future in which the theatrical movie medium is dominated by productions that are ever richer in high-tech visual arts and ever more impoverished in the art of telling a story. Its not that ""Oblivion"" has nothing on its mind; the narrative is fairly complex although full of recycled themes and potentially affecting. But feelings are discussed instead of dramatized in a film that doesnt know what to make of them while coherence suffers the moons fate. Mr. Cruise is Jack a man with a mission thats more mundane than one might guess from the weapons he wields and the so-called bubble ship he flies. Jack is basically a repairman. He fixes the drones that protect earths only remaining industry a vast extractive operation thats supposedly providing power for an ongoing human migration to Titan Saturns largest moon. ""We won the war"" Jack says at several points ""but we lost the planet."" As one of the last of his species in a lifeless environment he goes about his work like a flesh-and-blood WALLE and shares an ultramodern house perched on a slender pedestal with his significant other Victoria ( Andrea Riseborough); she also serves as his mission control when hes off on a repair trip. For a while theres an interesting contrast between the couples home life--they could pass for rather formal suburbanites savoring fine wines at dinner--and Jacks nagging nostalgia for an earth that no longer exists. His longings first surface in a silent hauntingly lyrical black-and-white preface that shows a bustling New York long before he was born as well as a smiling nameless beauty from the same era who has somehow become his most precious memory. Jack talks about those feelings a lot in elegiac tones that echo Ray Bradbury or Robert Heinleins classic story ""The Green Hills of Earth."" But his nostalgia provides the only vestige of emotional content for an extremely long while as the movie meanders blissed out on its own gadgetry and Jack chases around the planet in search of alien Scavengers or Scavs. (Almost an hour goes by before the outbreak of anything resembling straight-ahead action.) And when that long-remembered beauty of his dreams turns up as the sole survivor of a spaceship crash she acquires a name Julia--shes played by Olga Kurylenko--but not enough vitality to sustain interest in what becomes a menage a trois. A menage a quatre almost since Jack is also in love with Mother Earth. ""Oblivion"" was directed by Joseph Kosinski from a screenplay he wrote with Karl Gajdusek and Michael Arndt. Mr. Kosinskis previous film and his feature debut was the visually striking and dramatically turgid ""Tron Legacy."" When that one opened three years ago I described it as a deadly efficient machine for merchandising toys videogames and theme-park rides along with movie tickets. This one isnt deadly. The visuals are much livelier (the production was designed by Darren Gilford and photographed by Claudio Miranda) and theres always Mr. Cruise bright-eyed and intense though he looks silly enough at certain points in Jacks exertions--pointing his gun at every suspect sound piloting his ship with ""Top Gun"" panache in a ""Star Wars"" chase--to make you wonder if the filmmakers were intentionally flirting with self-parody. No such suspicions arise from Ms. Riseboroughs performance. Shes fully in command of a role that she invests with passion and with intriguing mystery. Why is the svelte Victoria so efficient at her work yet oddly reserved? Why do Jacks fugitive recollections of another life prompt her to insist that ""our job is not to remember""? (Sci-fi devotees will get her drift all too soon.) Why for that matter is she so svelte and why is there so little sexual excitement between Victoria and Jack? Everything about their private life is understandable in the context of subsequent events but the director hasnt given those domestic sequences any stylistic distinction apart from the sleek settings so their relationship remains merely odd. The film eventually answers all of the mysteries posed by the plot--Julias identity the roots of Jacks nostalgia the truth about the planetary apocalypse. And once the production lumbers into action mode Mr. Cruise is allowed to be yet again an action hero just as Jack is allowed to save the human species though not without the help of Morgan Freemans Beech. (Never mind who Beech is. Just know that Mr. Freemans gift for making anything seem plausible is once again put to the test and passes though barely.) Still the mystery posed by ""Oblivion"" as a whole is why its mysteries are posed so clumsily and worked out so murkily. ENLARGE Emmanuelle Seigner Ernst Umhauer and Denis Menochet Cohen Media Group In the House If ""Oblivion"" is an example of how not to tell a story Francois Ozons ""In the House"" is a celebration of storytellings power. The film is very clever and very French not only in its subtitled dialogue but in its love of language its concern for the relationship between writer and reader and its fascination with high culture. The cleverness gives considerable pleasure until the story grows absurd and the story within the story turns unpleasant like the creepily precocious young man who tells it. Watch a clip from the French film ""In the House."" A sixteen-year-old boy insinuates himself into the house of a fellow student from his literature class and writes about it in essays for his French teacher. (Photo/Video Cohen Media Group) Germain a jaded high-school teacher played by Fabrice Luchini takes unexpected delight in an essay written by 16-year-old Claude ( Ernst Umhauer). The subject is unexceptional a weekend stay at the house of a fellow student but Claude has an eye--and a nose--for detail; his vivid description of his friends mother includes her scent. When Germain incites his student to ever greater detail and perfervid invention Claude insinuates himself into his friends household and what began as a promising piece of pedagogy becomes a folie a deux with dangerously unpredictable--though gratifyingly salacious--consequences. Scheherazade would have understood the metasubject of stories and spells fact and fiction. Kristin Scott Thomas plays Germains wife Jeanne; she works in an art gallery and insists that literature and art teach us nothing about life. ""In the House"" isnt about life only literature and movies and its ever so clever self. ENLARGE Sam Rockwell Sony Pictures Classics/Courtesy Everett Collection DVD Focus Moon (2009) I recommended this small smart film a couple of years ago and Im noting it again because it deals albeit cryptically with themes that are central to ""Oblivion."" Sam Rockwell is Sam Bell an astronaut nearing the end of a three-year tour of solitary duty on the moon where hes been supervising machines that mine helium for fusion power on Earth. Suddenly he falls ill then discovers that hes not alone. Another Sam Bell has appeared insisting that hes not a clone. Duncan Jones directed deftly from a script by Nathan Parker. ENLARGE Magnolia (1999) Magnolia (1999) Tom Cruise gives a fearless absolutely flawless performance as Frank Mackey a high-revving narcissist who preaches a misogynist gospel of the id in this sprawling enthralling phantasmagoria set in the boundless burbs of Los Angeless San Fernando Valley. At a time when cynicism passes for wisdom Paul Thomas Anderson has made a wildly funny truly wise and subversively sincere film about pain forgiveness and the possibility of healing. The remarkable cast includes Philip Baker Hall Philip Seymour Hoffman William H. Macy Alfred Molina Julianne Moore John C. Reilly Jason Robards and Melora Walters. The cinematographer was Robert Elswit. ENLARGE Intimate Strangers (2004) Intimate Strangers (2004) Fabrice Luchini is William Faber a rueful slightly prissy accountant who has let life pass him by. Sandrine Bonnaire is Anna Delambre a woman who bares her soul to William after mistaking him for a therapist. Patrice Lecontes film which he wrote with Jerome Tonnerre is many things often at the same time a thriller that pays homage to Hitchcock; a blithe farce; a lurid tale of obsession; a wry study of the therapeutic process. Most of all though it is a love story that ends improbably but enchantingly with a birds-eye view of two people and a couch.

Slideshow Elements of past sci-fi films in Oblivion Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Oblivion >> Such is the lot of Jack Harper the latest Tom Cruise hero in the polished-to-a-sheen sci-fi puzzler Oblivion. The year is 2077 and according to Jacks introductory voice-over humankind has won a nuclear war against alien invaders but in the victory there was defeat the moon has blown apart causing epic tsunamis and earthquakes and the atomic fallout left most of the globe uninhabitable. And so everybody has rocketed off in the direction of Mars to begin anew. Which leaves Jack Harper and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) his domestic partner and navigator to keep the hydro rigs that supply water to the relocated billions safe from the pesky Scavengers a band of hooded roustabouts who emerge from the caves at night. But Jack and ""Vikas"" stint on Earth is almost done. A few more weeks and they too can ship off to Titan the biggest of the Martian moons. Before we go any further let it be be noted that Duncan Jones the writer and director of the nifty 2009 sci-fi indie Moon should contact an intellectual property lawyer. There are so many similarities between that modest melancholy space drama with Sam Rockwell as a solitary maintenance man servicing machinery and mining minerals on the lunar surface and the spectacularly rendered mega-budgeted Oblivion that it isnt funny. Apart from the premise the two share a third-act reveal that for the sake of those who may not have seen Moon will not be disclosed. Joseph Kosinski was handed the directorial reins on Oblivion after demonstrating a mastery of visual effects and an affinity for virtual realities with his debut TRON Legacy. He oversees some pretty impressive stuff here from the drones that ping-pong around in the air to the bubbleship that Jack uses to go to and fro - a jet/helicopter hybrid with a gimbaling cockpit - to that awesome house with its panoramic views. The sleek gray getups he and Riseborough wear arent too shabby either. Right from the get-go were told that Jack has memories he shouldnt have (there was a ""mandatory memory wipe"") and that a recurring one has to do with a beautiful woman he meets on the observation deck of the Empire State Building back in the days before the war. And so when a spaceship crash-lands Jack hies over to see whats up and finds a beautiful woman - NASA name tag J. Rusakova - in a sleep pod. He brings the astronaut back to the cool pad he shares with Vika and well thats when the trouble starts. Its like one of those Eric Rohmer moral tales the man the girlfriend and the other woman the one he really wants or loves. J stands for Julia and Julia is played by Olga Kurylenko the French muse of Terrence Malicks To the Wonder. Jack is so keen on her that he takes her to his secret cabin by the lake - the one where he keeps books about ancient Rome and a collection of vintage vinyl certain to impress (Blue Oyster Cult Duran Duran). At a certain point in all this Morgan Freeman shows up smoking cigars and leading a pack of rebels who look like extras from Mad Max. There is a silly Flash Gordon-style shootout deep in the bowels of the Earth involving drones and Scavengers Jack and Julia. And Melissa Leo is watching over everything from her command center somewhere in the Cloud checking in with Vika to ask if she and Jack remain ""an effective team."" By the end of the film Leo is beginning to sound suspiciously like HAL in 2001 A Space Odyssey. Robotic and more than a little peeved.

Universal Pictures Oblivion Director Joseph Kosinski Genre Action-adventure Running Time 126 minutes Rated PG-13; sci-fi action violence brief strong language and some sensuality/nudity With Tom Cruise Morgan Freeman Melissa Leo Watch Clips Watch A Clip From Oblivion - Theyre Human Theyre Human Credit Universal Pictures Watch A Clip From Oblivion - What The Hell? What The Hell? Credit Universal Pictures Watch A Clip From Oblivion - None Of Your Crew Survived None Of Your Crew Survived Credit Universal Pictures The score for Oblivion was composed by M83 a superb French electronic outfit that derives its name from one of the spectral pinwheels known as spiral galaxies. I point this out because its the best element of the movie -- a cascade of dreamy synthesizers that registers as appropriately futuristic (at least the future as suggested by 80s pop) while allowing an undercurrent of romantic yearning. More than that though it underlines director Joseph Kosinskis pursuit of digital beauty -- some combination of ""ones and zeros"" that can approach those pinwheels heavenly perfection. Its not the first time Kosinskis last film converted the arcade-game kicks of Disneys 1982 relic Tron into the 200 million screensaver Tron Legacy. With Oblivion the content comes a lot closer to matching the pristine form. Though its derivative in the extreme the film keeps the dialogue to a minimum -- and what dialogue it has is often deliberately formalized and robotic -- while creating a future of insidious elegance one in which the remnants of humanity and nature represent a threat to the artificial order of things. And so Kosinskis personal commitment to gorgeous artifice above all other considerations only harms the film so much. Based on the directors own unpublished graphic novel Oblivion gets all its exposition out of the way in one graceless chunk of opening narration. Its 2077 exactly 60 years after alien invaders called Scavengers (or ""Scavs"") appeared from another dimension and wiped out the moon before setting their sights on the Earths resources. Though mankind ""won"" the war against the Scavs the nuclear weapons required to do so -- combined with the devastating natural disasters brought on by the moons destruction -- killed off much of the population and rendered the planet uninhabitable. Those humans who did survive were whisked onto a space station until they can colonize elsewhere. Enter Jack (Tom Cruise) and his partner Victoria (Andrea Riseborough whose Disconnect is also out this week) a couple living in a home in the clouds above both the lingering radiation and the remaining Scavs stalking the territory below. Their official duty is to protect the machines drawing precious water from the seas mainly by ensuring that the unmanned drones intended to suppress the Scavs remain online. Though his memory of the war has been wiped Jack dreams of a woman (Olga Kurylenko) from a distant past who reappears when a NASA capsule crashes and forces him to rethink his mission. i The enigmatic Julia (Olga Kurylenko) surfaces from the mysterious past of Victorias husband Jack (Tom Cruise) a repairman tending drones on a largely abandoned Earth. Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures The enigmatic Julia (Olga Kurylenko) surfaces from the mysterious past of Victorias husband Jack (Tom Cruise) a repairman tending drones on a largely abandoned Earth. Universal Pictures Oblivion occupies an awkward no-mans-land between escapist space adventure and heady science fiction but its neither thrilling enough nor intellectually stimulating enough to satisfy devotees of either. The strongest scenes tend to be the least eventful long moody stretches in which Jack and Victoria go about their rounds then retire to a domestic life with too practiced a rhythm. Jack registers his lost-world longings by slipping off to a secret hideaway of lush greenery and the analog pleasures of books and LPs but its Riseboroughs Victoria whos the most affecting because her humanity registers in cracks that never fully disrupt her commitment to the mission. Kosinski handles the obligatory action beats capably with Jack zipping through the skies on a helicopter-spaceship hybrid that resembles a cross between tech from the Star Wars prequels and Cruises own Top Gun. (Kosinski throws in a stylish pair of aviator glasses as an homage to the latter.) The eventual gunplay distracts from the cool ambience of those early quiet scenes but as the film goes on and Kosinskis meditations on individual will grow gloppy and predictable such distractions become more welcome. Theres a faintly political message here about drone warfare but for all its hard sci-fi portentousness Oblivion advocates mainly for an earthy lifestyle of organic vegetables classic vinyl and more time in the great outdoors. In a film created entirely in front of green screens and behind computer terminals selling a message like that takes a certain nerve.

"Oblivion hints at a promising future review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesOblivion hints at a promising future reviewDirector Joseph Kosinskis sci-fi thriller Oblivion is stunning to look at and starts well but the narrative ultimately lets us down.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 18 2013OblivionStarring Tom Cruise Morgan Freeman Olga Kurylenko Andrea Riseborough and Melissa Leo. Directed by Joseph Kosinski. 124 minutes. Opens April 19 at major theatres. PGSci-fi thriller Oblivion gives us stars in the cast stars in our eyes and it even tweaks a brain cell or three.Which ought to be enough for the first blockbuster of summer 2013 and for the most part it is. Consider it a backwards compliment to say that what keeps this Tom Cruise/Morgan Freeman event picture from a total rave is that it doesnt quite live up to its splendid promise.Article Continued BelowCertainly there are no qualms about the visuals. Writer/director Joseph Kosinski confirms his flair for the fantastic that he brought to TRON Legacy another film that pleased the eye better than the mind.Working with Oscar-winning Life of Pi cinematographer Claudio Miranda Kosinski conjures a post-Armageddon Earth of 2077 where an atomic battle 60 years earlier with rapacious space aliens has left the globe a nearly depopulated cinder block vast portions of which are no-go zones still glowing with radioactivity. Vistas of ruined monuments bridges and other landmarks assault the senses especially on the IMAX screen where Oblivion plays best. You can almost smell the smoke and feel the tears and above it all floats the fragments of our once-whole moon an early victim of the pillaging space invaders called Scavengers (""Scavs"" for short).""We won the war but lost the planet"" intones Cruises Jack Harper an ex-Marine whose job it is to act as both security guard and repairman for an Earth that (shades of WALL-E) no longer shelters populations. Humanity long ago decamped for the (apparently) more hospitable climes of Saturns main moon Titan.But these ex-Earthlings need the water and power their home planet is still capable of generating. Giant hovering machines vacuum up saltwater for processing protected by heavily armed flying robot drones that resemble a cross between R2-D2 and an angry bulldog. Jack is also armed and always moving (something Cruise excels at) courtesy of a spidery mini-jet and groovy motorbike that he uses to scout landscapes and to find and fix damaged drones.The firepower is required to repel the few remaining Scavs on Earth -- ""Theyre still fighting but I do not know why"" Jack muses -- and also to protect him and his coworker/lover Vika (Andrea Riseborough) who is alternately officious and frisky.Jack and Vika live in a cloud-ringed tower of glass and steel that looks like Expressionist architecture as designed by Dr. Seuss but its not their home for much longer. Theyre attending to the final details of putting the extraction machinery on autopilot whereupon theyll quit Earth for Titan. Watching over this ""cleanup crew"" is a cheery authoritarian figure called Sally (Melissa Leo) who checks in from afar via grainy video link to see how Jack and Vika are getting along ""Are you an effective team?"" she keeps asking them affecting the cadence of a cult leader.Indeed they are except Jack is secretly haunted by dreams of a sultry woman (Olga Kurylenko also steaming up this weeks To the Wonder) with whom he shares intense looks on the observation deck of a pre-Armageddon Empire State Building.How can Jack be having these reveries when he submitted to the ""mandatory memory wipe"" required of all post-war Earthlings (for security reasons no doubt)? And speaking of eyes who or what belongs to the shadowy pair behind the binoculars that seem to watch Jacks every move on the planet?It strays into spoiler territory to say much more except to note that we have yet to meet Morgan Freemans character a man of dark glasses lit cigar and determined resolve. Rare for blockbusters Oblivion is in no hurry to reveal its secrets or to resolve its plot points even at the risk of testing audience patience.The screenplay by playwright Karl Gajdusek (Trespass) and Michael Arndt (Toy Story 3) takes pains to develop suspense building upon an unpublished graphic novel by writer/director Kosinski. An ear-grabbing score led by M83 the French electronic band helmed by Anthony Gonzalez teases themes from sci-fi movies past (Star Wars and Blade Runner among them). And classic rock fans will be tickled to see how Led Zeppelins ""Ramble On"" and Procol Harums ""A Whiter Shade of Pale"" fit into the narrative in ways that fit the mood and dont just pad out a soundtrack CD.But oh that narrative Its the flaw in Kosinskis diamond a pastiche of genre cliches that manage to make a muddle out of the films otherwise brainy exploration of existence identity memory and duality. It begins like Andrei Tarkovsky or Stanley Kubrick but ends like Michael Bay.The rushed third act seems as if it came from different filmmakers or perhaps a producers dictum providing conventional resolution that fails to fully satisfy Oblivions loftier thoughts.But a few thoughts are better than none during blockbuster season and we are treated once again to more of those great visuals. Kosinski has the look; all he needs now is a great script to make him truly soar.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert The dystopian thriller ""Oblivion"" is a breathtaking collage of welcome originality and references to a huge common cultural bank of fantasy images and themes. Its grandiose in scope and scale attentive to important details like character and tone and unafraid to tackle mature themes like love and loss personal identity and redemption. If theres a better science-fiction blockbuster this year Ill count us lucky. The film stars an intensely focused Tom Cruise as Jack Harper a futuristic repairman tending to weaponized drones that guard the giant rigs mining Earths final reserves of energy. The year is 2077 60 years after an invasion by alien hordes devastated the planet. The remaining human population has relocated to one of Saturns moons. Only violent alien marauders remain on the surface sabotaging the equipment that is extracting the planets last resources. Yet Jack five years after his mandatory memory wipe cant shake the feeling that this eerie brave new world is still his home. Who is that woman (Olga Kurylenko) who reappears so insistently in his dreams? The films look is mesmerizing combining hypnotically sleek industrial design workaday grubbiness and immense landscapes so stunningly barren that they elicit tangible unease. Director Joseph Kosinski (""Tron Legacy"") and cinematographer Claudio Miranda (who shot ""Tron"" and won an Oscar for last years ""Life of Pi"") make the impossible impressively realistic. Jack and his communications officer Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) live in a pristine glass-walled loft that floats thousands of feet above stunning cloud formations. Their solicitous superior Susan (Melissa Leo) checks in regularly via video screen to check their status as ""an effective team."" Jack makes his service calls to the surface in a whizzy vehicle that looks like an Apple-designed commuter jet. ""Only two more weeks Jack and we can finally leave and join the others"" Victoria cautions. ""Please dont take any chances."" Its as if someone is catering to his superficial needs in an effort to keep him from growing restless and inquisitive. While ""Tron"" was a dramatically inert bite of eye candy and Cruise can emit a soulless vibe here the star and director create gratifying emotional depth. A haunting loneliness pervades the story. When Jack visits a swath of desert terrain pierced by the spire of the Empire State Building or rappels through the blasted roof of the New York Public Library the effect is genuine pathos. Even shots of flowers stubbornly struggling to evolve in this decimated environment pack a punch. UNIVERSAL STUDIOS Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman in ""Oblivion."" Jack a former Marine has a generous supply of action-hero skills (this is a Tom Cruise movie after all) but he is at heart a high-tech grease monkey. He looks suitably worried awed and surprised when he encounters the plots several bombshells. Cruise is fully engaged in his scenes with Riseborough whose cool composure erodes as their caretaker assignment grows more perilous. She infuses her jargon-heavy ""Copy that"" dialogue with a rich subtext of vulnerability and longing. Even Leo seen only as a smiling broadcast visage imbues her honeyed tones with a hint of steely command at once cloying and creepy. Happily ""Oblivion"" is not a remake sequel reboot or the foundation for a projected franchise. It tells a self-contained mystery story that for all its explosive action passages feels like an epic episode of ""The Twilight Zone."" The film is rife with elements from its finest predecessors -- Kubrick Lucas the Wachowskis and Pixar could be listed as creative consultants -- but it has the spirit of a love letter to classic sci-fi not an opportunistic mash-up. Just as Lucas reached back to ""Flash Gordon"" serials for inspiration Kosinski borrows wisely and well. ""Oblivion"" will not fade from memory for quite a while. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Its Clunker No. 2 from the director of ""TRON Legacy."" CAST Tom Cruise Morgan Freeman Olga Kurylenko LENGTH 204 Lets see which famous science-fiction film does ""Oblivion"" most resemble? No not ""Minority Report"" another big-budget Tom Cruise vehicle. That movie had imagination energy humor and at least a hint of thematic depth none of which youll find in ""Oblivion."" Keep trying though because playing spot-the-influence is the most fun youll have during this expensive-looking slow-moving plod through familiar territory. All right how about ""2001 A Space Odyssey""? Thats where the white-on-white color scheme comes from and Cruise wears his tight-fitting spacesuit well as Jack Harper a post-apocalyptic repairman who roams Earth fixing broken drones. Meanwhile Morgan Freeman playing a rebel chieftain is clearly wearing Laurence Fishburnes circular sunglasses but comparisons to ""The Matrix"" end there. What about ""Total Recall"" another movie whose protoganist suffers flashbacks despite a memory wipe? Youre getting warmer. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The correct answer is ""WALL-E"" the 2008 animated film from Disney-Pixar. Who else is Harper but a sleek human version of the creaky little robot? Abandoned on a blighted planet Harper collects nostalgic detritus -- bobblehead dolls a Yankees cap -- and keeps them in his makeshift bachelor pad. In this case its a lakeside cabin not a shipping container and he prefers Led Zeppelin to ""Hello Dolly"" Granted instead of a cockroach companion Harper has a human wife Victoria played by an unexpectedly moving Andrea Riseborough but his true love (Olga Kurylenko ""Quantum of Solace"") will soon drop from the sky. And just like ""WALL-Es"" Eve she will introduce our hero to a strange new world that once glimpsed must be destroyed. ""Oblivion"" might have been mindless laser-equipped fun if not for its sluggish pacing and self- 236 MoviesOblivion trailer serious tone. The spherical drones Harper repairs are formidably fast foes but theyre among the few signs of life in the whole movie. Joseph Kosinski directing and cowriting from his own graphic novel is far more interested in nifty space gear (Harpers delicate whirly-glider is indeed a pretty sight) than in story or character. Its the same problem that plagued Kosinskis hollow debut ""TRON Legacy"" which come to think of it may be the sci-fi movie ""Oblivion"" resembles most. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT In the future a lone scout on an abandoned Earth makes a mysterious discovery.

So ""Top Gun"" has become ""Wall-E."" At least Cruise does get to fly around an aircraft again With its round twin gun turrets and a narrow cockpit in between it looks like a funny nose and glasses or possibly an intergalactic brassiere. So maybe think of him as Maverick-E. Its 2077 60 years since Earth was destroyed when a foul breed of mysterious alien attackers called the Scavengers or Scavs destroyed the moon which unleashed tsunamis and earthquakes that half-wrecked our planet. Then humankind in fighting back ruined the other half with a nuclear war. But all of this is just an excuse for New York landmarks to be trashed again The Manhattan Bridge and the Empire State Building get mostly buried and the filmmakers cant resist the cliches of the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge so they dont. Also the hero has vague flashbacks of repressed memories and theres an all-controlling force sometimes represented by an evil glowing eye. Wait a minute. You say I am having Total Recall of the Legend of the Planet of the Apes A Space Odyssey? Then youre beginning to think exactly like a successful hack screenwriter. Watch a few movies (skip the nonfamous ones) scramble the bits together dream up 200 million worth of effects and youve got something you can ""pitch"" to execs who have seen exactly the same movies (and not many others). Both you and the execs are in full agreement that originality requires too much work. Not that ""Oblivion"" isnt kind of fun; there are lots of zippy flying scenes and an adequate quantity of shootouts. Simply counting up the various rip-offs is a fun drinking game and the effects look cool or at least costly. Theres an eerie blue-gray glow to space-station scenes which feature clinically minimalist interiors with a design that suggests Steve Jobs will be back by 2067 -- and no longer confined to just one planet. On this space station just outside the Earths atmosphere that Jack Harper (Cruise) shares with his partner/lover Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) she is the liaison with Mission Control. (The boss is played by Melissa Leo who does a showy and pointless regional accent.) Jack meanwhile is out locating and fixing up armed drones that protect the mother ship from those rogue predators the Scavs. The drones turn out to be disappointingly poorly made Your average Roomba is more menacing. (Their shoddiness suggests that like Apple Microsoft will also always be around forever promising to get it right in the next generation.) Each of these robo-sentries is built with an exposed dinner plate-sized ""Shoot Me Anywhere But Here"" target that when hit causes instant destruction. Were these things designed by the same guy who built the Death Star? Also when theyre about to unleash half a dozen huge machine guns on you the drones sometimes pause lip-smackingly to savor the moment which to the untrained eye looks an awful lot like these machines are just waiting for someone to sneak up behind and shoot them. Additional problem Drones can be distracted by yelling ""Hey"" In two weeks Jack and Victoria are due to join the rest of humanity in the new colony on Saturn moon Titan but you kinda sorta get the feeling theyre never going to get there. Jack is plagued by dreams that feel almost like memories of a meeting atop the Empire State Building with a mystery girl (Olga Kurylenko). And the lead Scav (Morgan Freeman who looks fairly badass in a black cape) has other plans for Jack. As directed by Joseph Kosinski (""Tron"") ""Oblivion"" is one of those movies in which the main source of interest is simply in figuring out whats actually going on though when you do your reaction is bound to be a shrug. Without an exceptionally skilled director of actors (such as Cameron Crowe) Cruise cant dial up much emotion so the two love interests for his character are two more than he can convincingly handle. He may be at home in the cockpit of a killing machine but when it comes to displaying his humanity hes no Wall-E.

David James AP AP AP AP AP More information Oblivion Director Joseph Kosinski Cast Tom Cruise Morgan Freeman Olga Kurylenko Rated PG-13 (sci-fi action violence brief strong language sensuality/nudity) Running time 126 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 106pm on Thursday Apr. 18 2013 Thursday Apr. 18 2013 Thursday Apr. 18 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Oblivion is the Frankenstein of science-fiction movies.Stitched together from spare bits of other often better films -- 2001 A Space Odyssey Mad Max Silent Running WALL-E Moon Solaris Total Recall The Matrix and Prometheus just to name a few -- it stumbles awkwardly in story and plot shuffling toward the predictable explosions and fireballs of the third act. Yet despite all that Oblivion is surprisingly well-acted and so beautiful to look at that what at first seems like a cinematic monster is actually a handsomely compelling creation.Thats a little hard to believe considering that director/co-writer Joseph Kosinskis only previous feature is the dreadful TRON Legacy or that star Tom Cruise whos in virtually every scene is at his Cruise-iest here -- running jumping flexing showering inspiring envy from every other 50-year-old man on the planet. But somehow Oblivion transcends what could have been fatal flaws.In the near future Earth has been nearly destroyed by a battle with mineral-hungry aliens called ""scavs"" (short for ""scavengers""). The humans won but the planet is toast so most of whats left of humanity has been transported to a terraformed Titan one of Saturns moons.Jack (Cruise) Victoria (Andrea Riseborough Disconnect) and a small army of flying drones are left behind as a cleanup crew hunting down any remaining scavs and generally keeping an eye on things. Everything is hunky-dory -- Victoria is excitedly counting the days until they too can move to Titan -- until Cruise stumbles across a group of ragtag humans living underground led by the wise and able Beech (Morgan Freeman). They upend Jacks perfect world telling him that the official history he has been told all this time is a lie.If the subsequent twists and turns verge on the ridiculous viewers can take refuge in the films epic scope. Shot in Iceland with cinematography by Claudio Miranda (who won an Oscar for Life of Pi) Oblivion paints a world of gorgeous desolation. The pulsing yet soaring electronic score by French indie-dance act M83 and composer Joseph Trapanese adds to the sense of breathtaking sweep.Kosinski working from a script based on a graphic novel he co-authored manages the near-impossible He humanizes Cruise over the course of the 126-minute running time. But its Riseborough playing a woman in love with Jack who also feels him slipping away who gives the sleek Oblivion a sense of soul.On the down side Freeman Olga Kurylenko as a Jack love interest and especially Game of Thrones Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (so great in 2011s Headhunters) as Beechs right-hand man are criminally underused.By the end audiences may grow weary of things going boom. But theres one final twist that brings things back to Earth literally. This Frankenstein may not have as many brains as Kosinski might imagine but it definitely has a heart.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures) A high-concept movie is the kind that can be pitched to a studio executive in the time it takes him to do a line of coke Adam Sandler has to re-enroll in grade school to inherit his fathers fortune. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito are twins who were separated at birth. Tom Cruise is Americas top fighter-jet pilot.But in the new millennium summarizing Cruises movies has become an impossible mission. Even Don Draper wouldnt be able to describe ""Minority Report"" in 50 words or less. And that sci-fi mind-bender was as straightforward as a fortune cookie compared to ""Oblivion.""Ostensibly based on director Joseph Kosinskis graphic novel about a post-apocalyptic clean-up crew its more like a nonsensical mash-up of science-fiction blockbusters since ""2001 A Space Odyssey."" Theres a brazen reprise of the Death Star sequence from the original ""Star Wars."" Theres the abandoned Earth from ""Wall-E."" Theres the pod people from ""The Matrix."" Theres a even a glimpse of the fallen Lady Liberty from ""Planet of the Apes."" New York City circa 2077 is buried beneath the rubble from a war between humans and an alien race dubbed the Scavengers. Although the humans prevailed it required nuclear weapons devastating the planet. So the survivors have taken refuge on the moon of Saturn called Titan while the scorched Earth is guarded against a return of the Scavengers by Jack Harper (Cruise) and his mate Victoria (Andrea Riseborough).Instead of developing characters Kosinski (""Tron Legacy"") pours most of his imagination into the annihilated landscapes and futuristic gadgetry.In the midst of all this cool technology Jack is a typical Cruisean maverick with an old Yankees cap a bobblehead on the dashboard of his space pod and a wad of chewing gum for emergency repairs to the spherical drones that guard the hinterlands. But hes unprepared for a different kind of invader a crashed human astronaut named Julia (Olga Kurylenko) who was put into hyper-sleep before the war and claims that she is Jacks long-lost wife. Julia inadvertently leads Jack to a gang of ""Mad Max""-style survivalists in the catacombs of the New York Public Library. Their leader Beech (Morgan Freeman) has an even scarier secret to reveal one that forces Jack to question everything hes been programmed to believe.The questions raised by ""Oblivion"" arent especially deep but the movie does answer a puzzler that has troubled humankind for generations Can Tom Cruise build a concept so big that he himself cant lift it?

"Oblivion movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Tom Cruise Oblivion going nowhere glacially  Video Phillips calls Tom Cruises latest knotty and complicated Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Oblivion"" starring Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman. (Posted on April 17 2013) Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews ""Oblivion"" starring Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman. (Posted on April 17 2013) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Somethings wrong. Tom Cruise or rather Jack Harper his character in the placid new science-fiction adventure ""Oblivion"" cant shake his dreams of a woman giving him the big eyes on the observation deck of the Empire State Building.Its 2077. Earth has been devastated by a war with invading aliens. Most of the remaining populace has been relocated to a Saturn moon. Jack has recently undergone a ""mandatory memory wipe"" and now goes about his work a couple of weeks prior to his own exit from Earth. Hes a security guard and all-around Mr. Fix-It living and working high above whats left of Earths surface in Tower 49 with his lover/colleague Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). But who is this woman in Jacks dreams? I mean its Olga Kurylenko also starring in the new Terrence Malick film ""To the Wonder"" but who is she?A sort of ""Partial Recall"" ""Oblivion"" gives you a lot to think about. And too much time to think about it. The script by Karl Gajdusek (an interesting playwright) and Michael DeBruyn based on an unpublished graphic novel by the director Joseph Kosinski (""Tron Legacy"") weaves a tale involving governmental conspiracy a revolutionary underground movement (Morgan Freeman plays the supercool head of the ""scavs"" or scavengers) and various pro forma battle scenes that pit Cruise in his spaceship or on his futuristic motorcycle against a cadre of scowling moon-faced mechanical flying drones equipped with machine guns stolen from ""Attack of the Clones."" Jack knows somethings up when his HAL-9000-styled boss Sally (Melissa Leo seen only on video monitors and oozing the sort of fake charm that spells trouble) orders him to stay away from a crash-landing site. Does Jack follow orders? No. He follows his instinct and rescues the surviving member of the downed U.S. spaceship. She is the woman of his dreams played by Kurylenko and from there ""Oblivion"" springs a surprise or two.""Surprise"" is a relative term. Kosinskis rhythm and visual style are pretty square for such a squirrelly script Each grave purposeful exchange of dialogue (some of it pretty thick in terms of expositional back story) is laid out very carefully as if were idiots. The movies not bad for a while but its made of spare parts from a lot of other movies among them ""Total Recall"" ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" the ""2001"" riff ""Moon"" a certain recent play by Caryl Churchill (cant say; spoiler) and a few others.Whats interesting about it is its tight focus on a handful of characters. ""Oblivion"" is odder and less conventional than your average forgettable star vehicle; at times it feels like a five-character play taking place in a digital-effects lab. But theres not much energy to it. When you go to a futuristic dystopian post-apocalyptic barn dance starring Tom Cruise and his space guns you expect a little zap with your thoughtful pauses.mjphillipstribune.comOblivion -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for sci-fi action violence brief strong language and some sensuality/nudity)Running time 205Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Science Fiction (Movie Genre) Entertainment Movies Literature Arts and Culture Oblivion (movie) Tom Cruise Who are the early Oscars 2014 favorites?

More News Oblivion Feels Derivative All Stories >> OK thats the plot of Pixars WALL-E. Minus the animation its also the motor that drives Oblivion a fantasy without an original thought in its sleek empty head. Director Joseph Kosinski (Tron Legacy) knows from sleek. If looks were everything Oblivion - gorgeously shot by Life of Pi Oscar winner Claudio Miranda - would be the sci-fi Citizen Kane. Its not. With a script Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn adapted from Kosinskis graphic novel Oblivion is a scavenger feeding off better material. Get ready to play ""Name That Reference."" Tom Cruise stars as Jack Harper the fighter pilot (Top Gun) charged with eliminating any leftover aliens and protecting the drones at work on a hydroelectric energy plant. Hes the Chosen One (The Matrix). There are hints of mind-tampering (Total Recall) as Jack and Vika (Andrea Riseborough) his British partner and bedmate take orders from a computer named Sally a magnolia-voiced Melissa Leo (think HAL in 2001 A Space Odyssey). Vika stays in the glass bubble she and Jack use as home base. Is Vika real (Blade Runner)? She does get jealous when Jack discovers Julia (Olga Kurylenko) a beauty who reminds him of his past (Inception) when the Empire State Building still stood (Planet of the Apes). It takes a roving band of humans (The Matrix Reloaded) led by Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau to spark a climactic battle that has Jack seeing double (Avatar). For all the bells and whistles - an electronic score by M83 a screen-busting Imax presentation and Cruise going full throttle - Oblivion feels arid and antiseptic untouched by human hands. Bummer.

"Movie review Cruise-ing into Oblivion - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Cruise-ing into Oblivion Share Tweet This is a test player. Share Tweet By Mark Feeney Globe Staff | 04.18.13 | 1106 AM OK so its 2077 and Earth is not the place to be. Things got really bad here in 2017. Aliens showed up. No not the secure-the-borders kind the secure-the-skies kind. People called them the Scavengers. Humans won the ensuing war but at great cost. The moon was destroyed as was much of the Earth. The human race now lives on a moon of Saturn. One of the few people left on the planet is Jack Harper. Maybe ""above"" would be a better word than ""on."" Hes stationed with his lover/communications officer Victoria in a slick sleek command post atop a tower thousands of feet in the air. ""Were the mop-up crew"" Jack says. He goes down below on patrol keeping an eye on the remaining Scavs and overseeing the extraction of water and other resources from the now largely ravaged Earth. How ravaged? It looks a lot like the planet in ""Prometheus"" which makes sense since Iceland is where both movies did a lot of their exteriors. Related Links Find showtimes and theaters Find showtimes and theaters in IMAX Thats the basic plot situation. Really though all you need to know is that Tom Cruise plays Jack Harper. He rides a motorcycle. He shoots fancy-looking guns. He never gets fazed though he does get conked on the head. Thats the kind of guy Jack Harper is. Last winter Cruise played the title role in ""Jack Reacher."" What is it with the Jacks? His agent must have had some explaining to do when Cruise didnt get the lead in ""Jack the Giant Slayer."" Advertisement - Continue Reading Below ""Oblivion"" is a lot like its star clean cold efficient increasingly overblown and not a little inexplicable. Its based on a graphic novel by Joseph Kosinski the films director. Kosinskis previous movie was ""Tron Legacy."" He plainly likes repurposing older movies. At times ""Oblivion"" looks a lot like ""WALL-E"" (which makes Cruise the robot?). There are bits of ""Planet of the Apes"" ""2001"" the ""Matrix"" movies (Morgan Freeman as chief Scav resembles a cross between Laurence Fishburnes Morpheus and Bill Russell) ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" the Death Star in ""Star Wars"" and Im not making this up ""Sleepless in Seattle."" Andrea Riseborough plays Victoria. Sitting up in the tower she uses her hands to move the images on a big computer screen just like Cruise in ""Minority Report."" Did he teach her? Thats about the only thing they have in common. With her blank lugubrious face Riseboroughs an odd match for Cruises wolfish avidity. When Olga Kurylenkos spaceship crashes and Cruise goes to the rescue the match seems just as odd. Is there another actress today whose eyes are so empty and lips so full? Its a big month for Kurylenko. Shes starring in Terrence Malicks ""To the Wonder"" too. She doesnt get to say much in that movie and this one she doesnt want to say much -- at least not at first. Shes mum about the ships mission or why she is so desperate to retrieve its flight recorder. Once we find out its major switcheroo time plot-wise. This gives Cruise the chance to struggle with himself onscreen as he never has before. It also provides Kosinski with a big action sequence and climactic confrontation. He handles both somewhat confusingly. Good with openness and wide vistas hes challenged when put in tight places whether spatial or narrative. Any science fiction movie worth its space suit (Cruises is silvery-white and happily bulletproof) will offer at least some commentary however glancing on the present. In ""Oblivion"" this comes courtesy of the ubiquity of drones. They resemble angry-looking white weaponized versions of Pacman. These drones have a clunkiness thats pretty consistent with the other bits of technology in ""Oblivion."" Cruises motorcycle for example looks like something from a yard sale compared to Anne Hathaways in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" Darren Gilfords production design is not ""Oblivion"" at its best. Instead that would be whenever Melissa Leos no-nonsense image wavers on Cruises or Riseboroughs computer screen. Shes like Jack Nicholson showing up on the TV monitor in ""Broadcast News"" except Leos a lot tougher. Forget Riseborough or Kurylenko. Heres a woman whos a match for Cruise. Shes mission control on the space station thats their home base. The station is called Tet. For anyone over 50 (admittedly not the target demographic) thats even more bewildering than that ""Sleepless in Seattle"" connection. As its title might suggest remembering and forgetting are important elements in ""Oblivion"" as is history generally. In how many other movies has Lord Macaulays ""Lays of Ancient Rome"" been a plot point? But sometimes ""Oblivion"" can be pretty oblivious. Mark Feeney can be reached at mfeeneyglobe.com.

"Oblivion (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Oblivion (PG-13) Stunning visuals and special effects cant make up for a derivative story. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/18/2013 Editor rating 2 For its first hour or so Oblivion is a visually mesmerizing intriguing picture that doesnt feel like the same-old It engages your eyes and piques your curiosity. Then gradually the novelty wears off the cliches start to pile up and were back to Post-Apocalyptic Dystopia 101. In his follow-up to TRON Legacy director Joseph Kosinski with the aid of Oscar-winning cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Life of Pi) crafts some dazzling images and beautiful designs (the movie was shot using 4K cameras and enormous rear projections instead of green screens; see it in IMAX if you can). He also teases you with the story letting you know right from the start things may not be what they seem. The movie based on Kosinskis graphic novel is set in the year 2077 decades after Earth fought a battle with space invaders that rendered the planet a radioactive wasteland. Mankind has relocated to a moon off Saturn and relies on enormous long-distance power generators that feed off the ocean tides. Only two human beings remain Jack (Tom Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) who live in a sleek floating apartment and are assigned ""mop-up crew"" duty. Their job is to keep the electricity flowing and deal with roaming packs of the defeated alien forces which are still hanging around for some reason constantly making trouble. Jack and Victoria live and work together as a romantic couple. But he has a recurring dream of standing atop the Empire State Building before the end of the world with a beautiful woman (Olga Kurylenko) he doesnt know. Cruise is tasked with carrying Oblivion on his own for a surprising while -- there are long stretches when hes the only person onscreen -- and he has wisely chosen to tone down the clenched-jaw intensity he used in his last movie Jack Reacher and make this Jack a more relatable vulnerable fellow. Once again he appears to be doing a lot of his own stunts and he helps to sell the films great CGI illusions -- such as the floating drones that dot the planet ready to exterminate anyone or anything they dont recognize. Oblivion also features a thunderous score by the French electronic band M83 that elevates the excitement of the action sequences such as a gigantic shoot-out between man and drone in cramped quarters. But once the plot starts doling out the surprises the seams begin to show. Oblivion was co-written by Michael Arndt who won an Oscar for Little Miss Sunshine and also worked on Toy Story 3 and Brave so its especially disappointing to watch the movie dissipate into ideas and visuals from other films. There are distracting vibes of 2001 A Space Odyssey Wall-E Total Recall TVs Battlestar Galactica the underrated Moon -- even Star Wars. The filmmakers dont even have the courage to see the story to its proper end opting for a ridiculous finale that feels vaguely insulting to anyone who had invested in the film as a work of serious yet accessible pop sci-fi. See Oblivion for its look but dont expect anything more. Cast Tom Cruise Andrea Riseborough Olga Kurylenko Morgan Freeman Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Melissa Leo. Director Joseph Kosinski.

"Oblivion | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; oblivion ) Oblivion (United States 2013) April 18 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli We dont get many idea-based science fiction films these days so when one comes along it represents a welcome change of pace from the fantasy space opera that has co-opted the genre. Despite being tarted up with enough action to stave off boredom for inattentive viewers Oblivion is still more of a ""true"" sci-fi offering than 90% of what Hollywood passes off as such. Its not ""hard"" science fiction from the Asimov school but it feels more genuine than a lot of what tops box office tote boards and that may hurt it when it comes to the bottom line. Despite various shoot-outs dogfights chases and crashes Oblivion is not a teen-friendly film. The storyline is too dense and the pacing too uneven. Its easy to nitpick Oblivion to death. There are a lot of little holes and inconsistencies. The problem is related to the ratio between content and running time. Theres far too much material to be crammed into 126 minutes. The backstory alone could take up that much time. As a result things get glossed over and explanations are omitted. Its easy enough to rationalize most of what isnt clarified but annoying that the rationalizations are necessary. Oblivion is about the nature of identity - a common theme in more literate science fiction works. Is an individual defined by his/her DNA? Is it the sum of ones memories? What constitutes essential ""humanness""? Star Trek (especially The Next Generation) frequently addressed this question as did the reboot of Battlestar Galactica. Oblivion also draws upon other common science fiction themes (which I will not discuss here due to the ""spoilerish"" nature of mentioning them - the narrative contains a few surprises). The year is 2077. Earth is a barren wasteland the result of a conflict with aliens that happened 60 years ago. Humanity won the war but lost the planet - the survivors fled to Titan where they established a colony. The irradiated remnants of the ""home world"" are watched over by a series of drones and their human caretakers. Meanwhile the enemy hasnt been completely eradicated. Isolated survivors skulk around in the ruins of old cities and occasionally attack and cripple drones. Huge hovering conversion stations have been set up to turn water into steam power and funnel it to Titan to provide energy for the colony. Jack (Tom Cruise) and Vic (Andrea Riseborough) are a ""team"" nearing the end of a tour of duty as Earth-watchers. With their memories wiped before the mission neither boasts recollections of their days before inhabiting a high-tech apartment overlooking the East Coast. They arent married but their relationship is like a marriage. Vic stays in contact with Sally (Melissa Leo) her remote commander and Jack flies around in a high-speed craft locating and repairing damaged drones. But while Vic isnt interested in the past and wants to return to Titan as soon as possible Jack dreams of a beautiful mysterious woman named Julia (Olga Kurylenko) and claims the dreams are more like memories. Whats more he has become enamored of Earth and wants to remain. He has even built a make-shift cabin in a safe zone where he sometimes lands his craft for some Ramp;R. In the 00s Tom Cruise developed a penchant for appearing in science fiction movies although this is the first one he has made since 2005s War of the Worlds. He brings whats needed to the role the same ruggedness and physicality that served him well in the Mission Impossible series. Andrea Riseborough essays an emotionally vacuous character; the shallowness of the portrayal is likely more a reflection of intent than an indication of her ability. While she and Cruise never connect the same cannot be said of Cruise and the ethereal Olga Kurylenko. Her performance here is more ""earthy"" than the one she gives in To the Wonder but the expressivity of her face is as much an asset in this film as in Malicks and she works well with Cruise. Morgan Freeman (chomping on a big cigar) and Nikolaj ""Jaime Lannister"" Coster-Waldau have supporting roles as human refugees living on Earth. The visual effects work is first-rate. Most of this involves creating a post-cataclysmic New York and D.C. including such landmarks as the Empire State Building the Pentagon the Washington Monument the Statue of Liberty and the Brooklyn Bridge. Obviously this isnt the first time weve seen this sort of thing - Planet of the Apes set the standard - but its done as well here as anywhere else. The sound effects including a throbbing score are ""punched up"" enough to be memorable although there are times when they call too much attention to themselves. This is the second directorial effort from Joseph Kosinski who made his debut with the much-heralded TRON Legacy. Here hes working from a screenplay he co-wrote based on his own graphic novel so he has to take blame for the films failings especially the narrative shortcomings and pacing problems. At the same time he can claim credit for bringing to the screen a story that is intriguing enough to engage viewers who are interested in more from futuristic stories than explosions and space battles. Much like Cloud Atlas Oblivion is imperfect but some of its imperfections result from being overly ambitious. And while one could argue that characters are secondary to the ideas and storyline throughout Oblivion I found myself caring about what happens to the people at the end and what that last moment signifies for the concept of identity.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For speculative-fiction fans the least interesting part of any modern science-fiction movie is its final act. The opening of films like Joseph Kosinskis Oblivion tend to be about world-building about creating a future and establishing its rules. The second act lets the characters explore and make significant decisions. But like Leo Tolstoys happy families science-fiction movie endings tend to all be alike a big pileup of chases and explosions. The acts are extended in Oblivion which applies an intriguingly complicated mixture of wonder and workaday tedium to its world-building then lays on the developments fast and thick in the discovery phase. But it all comes down to blowing things up in the end. Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough star as a placid couple living in a spectacular spartan glass-and-steel spire in the post-apocalyptic ruins of New York City. As Cruise establishes in a tediously overstuffed opening monologue aliens called Scavengers or ""Scavs"" attacked Earth 50 years ago and the battle to drive them out left Earth ravaged and unlivable. The remnants of humanity are moving to Saturns moon Titan once a series of giant harvesters have turned the oceans into fuel. Cruise Riseborough and a handful of sinister gun-bots are the last people pulling guard duty on the planet protecting the harvesters from the scattered Scavs until their deployment ends in a few weeks and reporting in to mildly sinister mission controller Melissa Leo. In spite of that hushed heavily oversold opening monologue co-writer/director Kosinski takes his time in unfurling Oblivions world from Earths stark abandoned IMAX-friendly vistas to Cruise and Riseboroughs relationship. Oblivion shines in the moments that are least crucial to the plot as Cruise explores a thunderstorm in his sleek futuristic personal conveyance or Riseborough trades pleasantries with Leo that seem just a bit too barbed. An unsettling sense of not-quite-right coats all of the films steely surfaces and Kosinski and his co-writers give audiences plenty of time to absorb the unease and gear up for the action. Oblivions primary issue is that everything that comes next supposedly emerges from Cruises characters humanity curiosity and personality yet given that hes Tom Cruise he doesnt evince much of any of these things. His Earth-loving nightmare-having order-disobeying daredevil comes across as the exact same intent vaguely desperate vaguely angry protagonist he played in Minority Report and the Mission Impossible movies and theres nothing here to differentiate him from Generic Heroic Template To Be Personalized Later. Instead Oblivions personality comes from the CGI production design; co-writer/director Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Life Of Pi) previously worked together on Kosinskis debut Tron Legacy which had a similar style-over-character aesthetic with plenty of gloss and no warmth. Oblivion is a terrific-looking movie alternating spare sterile environments with homey organic ones and making both look tremendously pretty. Kosinski also handles his action well with cut-and-dried clarity and edge-of-seat energy. And while the story developments heavily echo other science-fiction films--some classic some recent but all earlier to the finish line on these particular plotlines--Kosinski and his screenwriting partners wind them into the action effectively. But this remains the kind of film where viewers know Cruise is sad because he says in voiceover that hes sad; they know hes in love because he and his partner rotely announce it. And they know hes driven because he keeps mechanically repeating a Thomas B. Macaulay poem about death while facing fearful odds. Theres a clinical remove to virtually every step in Oblivion that doesnt get in the way of the pieces as they slot into place but does make the story feel hollow. All its missing is Cruise proclaiming in a monotone in the middle of the final battle ""This is very exciting.""

That is until now. The thrilling ""Minority Report"" from 2002 ranks not only among his best films but as one of the greatest sci-fi films ever. And while ""War of the Worlds"" the 2005 remake in which Cruise reteamed with ""Report"" director Steven Spielberg had issues especially the ending it nevertheless emerged as a decent renovation of the H.G. Wells classic.But in ""Oblivion"" sci-fi lets Cruise down.Conceived by ""Tron"" director Joseph Kosinski from his graphic novel ""Oblivion"" suffers from what could be called the hottie complex. It looks sleek and sexy on the outside but theres precious little substance on the inside. The special effects are first-rate but its dystopian plot is not. This film publicity image released by Universal Pictures shows Olga Kurylenko left and Tom Cruise in a scene from ""Oblivion."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures) Set in a post-apocalyptic 2077 ""Oblivion"" is about the realization by one worker bee (Cruise) that life is not at all what it seems and that the girl (Olga Kurylenko of ""To the Wonder"") invading his dreams holds shattering significance. Plot twists are involved so I dont want to reveal too much but its safe to say that when developments play out theyre hardly knock-your-socks-off revelatory in the way screenwriters Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn deem them to be.The first half of ""Oblivion"" holds up best as we meet a two-team crew -- Jack (Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) -- stuck on an Earth devastated by an alien showdown. If youve seen ""Tron"" you know Kosinski prefers gizmos over characters and he introduces us to some uber-cool contraptions that would get even James Bond shaken and stirred. My favorite is the helicopter hybrid Jack flies -- wish you could buy it on Amazon.Advertisement The mix of gee-whiz gadgetry and the day-to-day routineness of Jack and Victorias lives is interesting enough but the film is too glacially paced for it to work. The two share a lot including the same boss -- a vapidly smiling Sally (Melissa Leo in a small role that I wish were bigger). They also share the same bed and the same pool (Cruise has a lot of Taylor Lautner-like gratuitous shirtless scenes). We drop in on them as their stint overseeing an assignment that sucks the marrow from Earths natural resources is entering its final phase.But the promise built up in the beginning self-destructs right about the time Jack does a stopover at his own secret spot on Earth and when Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (""Game of Thrones"") enter the scene as survivors. I cant reveal how this influences the plot but in the end ""Oblivion"" struggles to come up with something profound to say. Ridley Scotts ""Prometheus"" befell a similar fate. While ""Oblivion"" is more enjoyable it still cant compare to a more fully realized sci-fi mind tripper like last years ""Looper"" a film that worked because it balanced the gizmos with the human drama. ""Oblivion"" does a fine job on the technology side but the emotional part rings as hollow as a deserted vessel drifting through space.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday April 17 2013 600 AM Title Oblivion Film Info PG-13 Violence nudity. Area theaters. Opens Friday. Memories of earlier sci-fi dramas peek out of ""Oblivion"" like bits of New York jutting out of the futuristic rubble. From high on the shoulders of ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" ""Silent Running"" ""Solaris"" ""The Matrix"" and others director Joseph Kosinskis movie surveys a hodgepodge of narrative worlds and our mental circuits make the connections. Yet while fans of apocalyptic cinema may hope to add ""Oblivion"" to those ranks Kosinskis ultimately underwhelming film leads nowhere. As its palpable sense of dread -- well-sustained in a gently cascading first hour -- gives way to dead ends this Omega Movie shoots itself in the foot. Tom Cruise is Jack Harper a high-tech repairman in 2077. Some 60 years earlier aliens blew up the moon triggering tsunamis and earthquakes before humans set off nukes to defeat the invaders. As Jack pilots his space helicopter across the now-desolate East Coast repairing huge automaton drones that use ocean water to power our new home off Saturn hes wistful for an Earth he never knew. Jack and his communications officer Victoria (Andrea Riseborough) live as a couple in a floating condo receiving orders remotely from chilly commanding officer Sally (Melissa Leo). Despite a ""mandatory memory wipe"" Jack has flashbacks to a pre-attack Manhattan and visions of a beautiful woman (Olga Kurylenko) he cant place. While investigating ""scavengers"" hiding out in the remains of the New York Public Library Jack discovers theyre humans and led by a benevolent leader (Morgan Freeman). He encourages Jack to seek the truth about the drones which winds up impacting Jacks hideaway inside a still-lush ""radiation zone"" and the world he thinks is lost. Then a ship crashes down containing the very woman he has been dreaming of. Its disappointing that after a promising start the big-budget ""Oblivion"" fails at the kind of twisty tug-of-war stuff a small movie like ""Moon"" did so memorably. Kosinski (""Tron Legacy"") gets the landscape right but overloads the internal engine. Olga Kurylenko plays a mysteryious woman who crash-lands on Earth in Oblivion. Cruise luckily dials down the intensity making Jack a low-blood-pressure kind of hero. As is often the case in his movies -- if not his publicity -- Cruise has a knack for knowing how to make things work. That serves him well during ""Oblivions"" often solitary setup as well as in his scenes with Riseborough (a lovely puzzle of detachment) and Kurylenko (more one-note). Though the stars efficiency fits into the overall plan the film gets weighed down by too much plot even as it lacks good ideas. Several screenwriters helped adapt what had been Kosinskis sketched-out idea for a graphic novel and the struggle shows. ""Oblivion"" feels like a gaggle of sci-fi fanboys riffed late into the night letting one strand of plot beget another. The sad reality is that all this string theory turned into a big knotted-up twine ball. Magic moment Cruises action hero runs up against a face he knows well. USING MOBILE?

Director Joseph Kosinski.Cast Tom Cruise Morgan Freeman Olga Kurylenko.Rating PG-13 for sci-fi action violence brief strong language and some sensuality/nudity. By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Apr 17 2013 951 AM ""Oblivion"" may not live up fully to its grand ambitions but it isnt for lack of trying. The film starring Tom Cruise and directed by Joseph Kosinski dips its toe into all manner of science-fiction waters. (Its much better than Kosinskis last film ""TRON Legacy."") The story probably doesnt stand up to heavy scrutiny and at times the effort by star and director shows. But at least the effort is there. The film is beautiful to look at. You can check off most of your go-to sci-fi elements here a post-apocalyptic dystopian future; aliens; memory wipes; outlying rebels; the aforementioned Tom Cruise. Some are used more effectively than others including Cruise. The puzzlements will be explained by the end but as is often the case the fun is in the getting there. The movie is set in 2077. In a voiceover Jack Harper (Cruise) explains that 60 years ago aliens destroyed Earths moon throwing everything out of whack. Natural disasters wrecked the planet. Then the aliens called Scavengers or Scavs for short invaded. Humans were able to win the war but had to resort to nuclear weapons ruining what was left of Earth. So the human race moved to Titan a moon of Saturn. Jack and his partner Vika (Andrea Riseborough) live high above the ruins in a Spartan-chic airy home. Theyre the ""mop-up"" crew as Jack calls them. Every day he takes his helicopter-plane hybrid down to the surface to repair the drones that guard against the remaining Scavs who try to disrupt the water-extraction project that is essential to human survival. Vika tracks him and reports on their efforts to her boss (Melissa Leo) whose Southern accent drips with disingenuous charm. It sounds like a pleasant-enough existence but they only have two weeks left on their shift. Vika cant wait to head for Titan but Jack isnt so sure. He is haunted in his dreams by visions of pre-war New York where he stands on the Empire State Buildings observation tower with a beautiful woman (Olga Kurylenko). Hes also carved out little bits of Earthly nostalgia wherever he can though to reveal more beyond the Yankees cap he wears while hes fixing drones would be a mistake. It is fair to say however that some little touches like a record-player needle dropping on a vinyl album are surprisingly agreeable. Of course not all of this is what it seems. Jack will eventually come into contact with a man named Beech (Morgan Freeman). That along with Jacks rescue of a familiar looking survivor of a spacecraft crash will make Jack question the truth about his existence even more. This just scratches the surface of the twisty tale. You will see most of the surprises coming but one in particular is effective and moving. Cruise is in likable action-hero mode which means that Jack is well likable and heroic in an action-packed kind of way. (Cruise bugs people for some reason; I suspect it has more to do with his off-camera persona than what we see on-screen. If nothing else his characters are entertaining to spend a couple of hours with and Jack is no exception.) Freemans not in the movie much. It mostly falls to him to explain a few hard truths to Jack. And when theyre explained in that voice-of-God delivery of Morgans well you cant doubt him for long. In some ways Riseboroughs Vika is the most-intriguing character in the movie. Shes officious so by-the-book you wonder whether she is simply trying not to blow her assignment with so little time left or up to something more. None of this works without Kosinski who aims big. Leos supervisor repeats a question to Vika throughout the film asking about Vika and Jacks success. ""Are you an effective team?"" ""Oblivion"" doesnt rise to the level of movies like ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" or even ""WALL-E"" just two of many by which Kosinski is so obviously influenced. But are Kosinski and Cruise an effective team? As Vika might way definitely. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Sadly what we have here is a stale pretzel. I would describe the movie as a mash-up of The Matrix Blade Runner and Planet of the Apes but that makes it sound better than it is. The year is 2077 and Tom Cruise--proving that at age 50 he can still run jump and brawl like a man in his twenties--plays Jack Harper a can-do engineer stationed on Earth 60 years after the planet was totaled by an alien race that destroyed the moon which led to an Armageddon of tsunamis earthquakes and nuclear annihilation. What was left of the human race shipped off to Titan one of the moons of Saturn leaving behind the detritus of our defeated civilization (football stadiums in ashes a leaning Washington Monument -- you know typical Roland Emmerich stuff). The only folks left behind on the uninhabitable planet are Jack and his submissive sex-kitten supervisor Victoria (W.E.?s Andrea Riseborough) who live in a sleek glass Jetsons pad in the clouds and whose memories were wiped before they were assigned to their not-so-glamorous new gig. Jack heads down to Earth?s barren surface every day to repair cue ball-like patrol drones that scan the landscape for rebel alien ?Scavengers? while Victoria checks in with Mission Control (Melissa Leo sporting a syrupy Foghorn Leghorn drawl that telegraphs that she?s up to no good). Even though his memory has been erased Jack still has flickers of the past?mostly of a beautiful mystery woman (Quantum of Solace?s Olga Kurylenko) on the Empire State Building?s observation deck (where else?). Then one day Jack investigates a spacecraft that crash lands in the desert and finds the jettisoned crew of the ship asleep in cryo-pods. The only one to survive is?the woman from his dreams. Jack?s discovery makes him question his mission and his identity. Familiar right? All that?s missing is Harrison Ford in a trench coat and an origami unicorn. Even Morgan Freeman?s small role (it looks a lot meatier in the trailer) feels like he?s doing a karaoke version of Lawrence Fishburne?s Morpheus. Kosinski who made the unnecessary 2010 Tron reboot look so cool manages to cough up some memorable action sequences. Cruise has one aerial dogfight sequence in a spaceship through vertiginous canyons that?s so thrilling it will make you feel like you?re watching Top Gun?s Maverick back in action. The actor gets to model hi-tech jumpsuits (paired with an old-school New York Yankees cap?figures) and indulge his need for speed zipping around in some gee-whiz futuristic hardware. And as always he proves why he?s been a perfect engine of gung-ho Hollywood professionalism for the past three decades. The man?s incapable of half-assing it or phoning it in. But unlike his characters in Minority Report and War of the Worlds he?s a bit of a cypher here. Thanks to Kosinski and cinematographer Claudio Miranda (Life of Pi) Oblivion has enough special-effects artistry to keep you distracted for a while. But all the eye candy in the world can?t mask the sensation that you?ve seen this all before?and done better. Too bad the movie?s script wasn?t given the same attention as its sleek brave-new-world look.

As a potential gateway drug to the genre the ambition of its ideas and extent of its world design are considerable attributes; as the latest studio stride towards so-called ""original"" sci-fi (in that its not a sequel prequel remake or reboot) those aforementioned ideas are glaringly indebted to several earlier works and the film overall remains beholden to one established brand above all others Tom Cruise. Sixty years hence the human population of our war-torn planet has been evacuated to an orbiting space station from which all will soon travel to Titan to begin life anew. Until then massive hydro-energy whatsits harness whats left of our oceans devices protected from meddlesome scavengers by robotic drones which are themselves kept in working order by Jack (Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough). He takes to the planets surface for repairs by day while she keeps tabs from sky-scraping living quarters and reports back to the sweetly authoritative Sally (Melissa Leo) and once drone duties are done they keep one another company in their luxury limbo situated as it is between the heavens and Earth. Two more weeks until Titan Victoria reminds imploring to the ever-curious Jack that he shouldnt get any bright ideas that he shouldnt break protocol that he shouldnt take nightly nookie in their translucent sky pool for granted. Jack being Jack -- which is to say Jack being Cruise -- he fails to sit idly by as emergency pods fall from the sky without warning and once he retrieves Julia (Olga Kurylenko) a lone survivor with an oddly familiar face her questions only serve to fuel his own. Also check out In Defense of Tom Cruise as the Ultimate Directors Actor Just as Harper is forced to repair drones using only recycled parts Kosinski builds his universe mostly using the same. Jacks bubble ship and sky condo have all the polish of any given iDevice; the evident destruction of New York City landmarks bring to mind ""Planet of the Apes"" if somehow nothing else; while a bomb-minded resistance movement led by the Morpheus-like Beech (Morgan Freeman) more specifically evokes ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes."" Our heros fondness for rare post-apocalyptic plant life and women with a strict work ethic cant help but remind one of ""Wall-E"" while the sight of a shattered moon often looming over the horizon finally gives one cause to recall 2002s update of ""The Time Machine."" There are even more evident signposts beyond that initial set-up but to simply name them would be to give up ""Oblivions"" few intended surprises. The more that Jack tries to remember the more that sci-fi-savvy viewers will try to forget as they beat him to an inevitable awakening. However unoriginal they are the fact that this film is even entertaining Big Ideas automatically marks it as a step forward from the monochromatic monomyth exercise that was ""Tron Legacy."" The case might soon be made that this films second-half revelations prove conceptually critical of its very own existence; alas well return to biting our tongues for now. What can be said is that Kosinskis emphasis on style over substance informs ""Oblivion"" much as it did ""Tron"" offering forth only the most handsome stretches of desolate wasteland and glimpses of plasticine future tech for our enjoyment as the helmer fulfills Zack Snyders absence in bringing bitchin album art to life on the big screen. (On a related note M83 and Joseph Trapaneses score here unsurprisingly evokes Daft Punks like-minded electronica soundtrack for ""Tron"" when not outright parroting Hans Zimmers ""Inception"" cues -- yet another element rendered with equal parts urgency and familiarity.) The sight of an aggressive drone floating slowly through billowing flaming curtains at one critical moment epitomizes the directors eye for the coolest cruelty and everything else about the film from the characters to the plotting reinforces the extent to which sheer functionality dominates the proceedings. Anyone who isnt Jack only serves to nudge him towards his destiny and every big reveal finds itself sandwiched cozily between suitably slick action beats themselves each doled out with clockwork precision. In turn the human components all do their part with Cruise running gunning yelling and jumping while Riseborough comes closest to introducing much-needed passion and vulnerability to an otherwise routine revolution. The title itself even has a certain generic grandeur to it promising extinction-scale stakes in the moment while begging to be accurately remembered a year from now let alone sixty. Somehow setting aside its exhaustively derivative central mystery the base-level spectacle of ""Oblivion"" does manage to be Big and Loud and Not Entirely Incoherent for those willing to watch Tom Cruise serve his primary purpose in the guise of a man trying to uncover his primary purpose. Sure I may not sound overly thrilled by the end result but just go back and ask 14-year-old me what he thought.

Joseph Kosinskis Oblivion based on his own graphic novel is one of those futuristic puzzlers whose dramatic energies are most invested not in the characters or their fates exactly but in the slow revelation of its own premise. Youll begin to doubt the storys initial setup--its 2077 and the Earth is mostly uninhabitable after humanity defeated an invading alien force--the second its hero mentions having recently had his memory wiped and that his wife has been ""assigned"" to him.Which brings us to Tom Cruise the not-necessarily-good news. However engaging its end-times mysteries Oblivion is still a Tom Cruise movie. Hes rarely credible these days playing specific humans but he is without peer as Mr. Charge-Ahead Movie Hero the guy who feels only one thing at a time always exactly what the scene demands. (His default mode relentless determination.) Hes like some premium plot-moving app producers can download for their blockbusters--but he comes with the usual bugs. To witness Oblivions marvels youll have to watch him do all he does in movie after movie modeling jumpsuits and sunglasses; racing about on a dirt bike; getting tied to a chair; running in that stiff and measured way that makes him look like an animated GIF titled ""Tom Cruise Running.""Here as in Minority Report hes excellent when hes in motion but risible when he slows down to ache over the normal life his characters are always denied--are we truly meant to believe these engineered-to-move Cruise supermen would prefer the familial idyll?Film Details Oblivion RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time125 More Info Trailer Still in the first act Cruise proves ideally suited to the role. Hes his usual everyman/automaton a man whos just like any of us except that hes the absolute best at everything he tries ever. Here in a Yankees cap that reminds us hes still all-American even a generation after America hes a technician charged with monitoring a large swath of the abandoned Eastern Seaboard as the rest of humanity on a towering space station preps to be shipped off to Titan. Hes called Jack Harper--is there a spigot in Hollywood that dispenses action hero names?--and each day he zips down to Earth from his home in the clouds a Frank Lloyd Wright casserole dish speared atop a Jetsons pole. Down here in his flying machine he traverses the canyons of a ruined U.S. to monitor and repair the patrol drones that space station dispatches to protect--well just what theyre protecting is a third-act revelation youll have to wonder about until Harper finally does. (The Cruise app never thinks more than required.)Those drones look like Luke Skywalkers helmet tricked out with guns and the eye of HAL; theyre wicked next-tech marvels with the weight and presence of old-fashioned special effects--you never doubt that theyre really there somehow on the set with Cruise. Cruises early adventures with them in whats left of New York unfold with a suspenseful patience rare in movies this expensive. At its best as Cruise explores a ruined stadium or a cratered library Oblivion takes on the immersiveness of the greatest video games--with apologies to the late Mr. Ebert thats a compliment. Heres your cypher/avatar picking through a wide-open alien environment with time given for you to savor the world around you. Director Kosinski proves himself talented in ways his Tron Legacy didnt suggest. You might wish hed been allowed to indulge in longer prouder shots of his wonders la the Kubrick he seems to admire.But Cruise is contractually required to sprint and drones tend to get turned on the drone-keeper. So the stately opening gives way to explosions and plot Theres an invasive alien species to deal with as well as the usual tattered squad of post-apocalyptic refugees. Plus the mission-control overseers Harper reports to (theyre on that space station) seem to have interests other his own in mind.Andrea Riseborough is officious and funny in a role that should be less familiar than it is the hive-minded beauty chosen to be Tom Cruises wife. Morgan Freeman featured prominently in the advertising only has a couple of scenes which also echo video games but in the bad way. Like a cut-scene character he doles out exposition and seems programmed to do what he does no matter how our hero responds. The third act bogs down with twists and answers many of which youll see coming before Harper pauses even to consider them but the ending--which involves another patient immersion in another strange world--inspires awe. The hard choices Harper makes are ones characters have faced since we first started telling stories but Oblivion does achieve an inhuman majesty.Follow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

The results looks amazing but most of the ideas that resonate will feel very familiar and more than a bit warmed-over. Youll see one if not both of the movies big twists coming and while a case could be made that ""Oblivion"" will make the boldest anti-drones statement of any fictional film this year its a chilly movie that never draws you in enough to get fully invested in whats happening. Tom Cruise opens the film with a head-spinning torrent of exposition but it boils down to this Its 2077. Sixty years earlier alien invaders wrecked the moon destroying much of Earth. What was left of the planet got trashed by nukes used to fight off the E.T.s and now most of the population lives on a moon of Saturn. The only people left on Earth are Jack (Cruise) and Victoria (Andrea Riseborough ""W.E."") who live in a high-tech house in the clouds and whose memories were wiped five years earlier. He goes out every day to repair the drones that scan the earth for the remnants of the alien Scavengers; she reports their progress to Sally (Melissa Leo with a ludicrous twang) at Mission Control. Unbeknownst to Victoria Jack still remembers meeting up with a mystery woman (Olga Kurylenko of ""To the Wonder"") at the Empire State Building back before the war. Hes also built a secret hideaway in the mountains a lakeside cabin where he can shoot hoops listen to old vinyl LPs and squirrel away the books he has found in his travels. One day Jack happens upon the top of the Empire State Building which the Scavengers are using as a homing beacon; following the coordinates being sent out he finds a crashed spaceship but the passengers arent aliens -- theyre humans. And one of them is the lady from Jacks dreams. This discovery sets in motion Jacks new understanding of who he is and what has happened to Earth and ""Oblivion"" might have worked better if it werent so proud of these revelations that most audience members will figure out long before the characters do. Kosinski is great with the doohickeys -- Jacks transport his fold-up motorcycle that house of the future -- but neither the plot nor the characters click the way they should. (And I say that as someone who actually liked ""TRON Legacy."") Cruise has to spend most of the film playing a literal blank slate but even after he starts filling in his own memories the character remains as vague as ever. And poor Morgan Freeman who turns up late in the film gets saddled with some astonishingly cliched dialogue. (That YouTube reel of characters in dozens of movies saying the line ""You look like shit"" just got three seconds longer.) M83s score is mostly effective but even it feels unoriginal like the love child of Daft Punks ""TRON Legacy"" music and the ""Inception"" BWAAAAH. Theres a weirdly sexist tinge as well with the female characters being either nefarious or inert (not to mention a triangular big bad alien presence that could have been designed by Judy Chicago). ""Oblivion"" also indulges in one of those have-your-cake endings that are so popular of late; not to give anything away but this is another movie that promises a gutsy powerful denouement only to give the audience a reassuring wink and a high-five. The stink of studio notes and focus groups pervades throughout in fact -- that awkward narration at the beginning shares information that Jack offers up again later in the film; one imagines a test audience complaining that they didnt understand what was happening and the studio deciding to overlay all that clunky exposition up front. Just a theory but Id put five bucks on it. If the dialogue and the concepts of ""Oblivion"" had been as fresh and powerful as its art direction wed really have something here. Instead its something borrowed packaged inside something new. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Daily Edition Login to download Oblivion Film Review 800 AM PDT 4/10/2013 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS itunes A terrific-looking sci-fier that loses steam in the second half. TWITTER Universals sci-fi thriller from ""Tron Legacy"" director Joseph Kosinski opens April 19. A sort of The Eternal Return played out in the ruins of a post-apocalyptic planet Earth Joseph Kosinskis Oblivion is an absolutely gorgeous film dramatically caught between its aspirations for poetic romanticism and the demands of heavy sci-fi action. After a captivating beginning brimming with mystery and evident ambition the air gradually seeps out of the balloon that keeps this thinly populated tale aloft leaving the ultimate impression of a nice try that falls somewhat short of the mark. Theres enough futuristic eye candy and battle scenes to lure the genre boys while the presence of three important female characters as well as Tom Cruise in good form could attract more women than usual for this sort of fare resulting in mostly robust but not great returns worldwide. The Universal release opens this week in most international territories while the domestic bow comes April 19. To those who might wish to avoid a film by the maker of Tron Legacy it should be stressed that Oblivion is a more interesting work by a good distance an imaginative speculative piece set some six decades hence that always engages serious attention even if it doesnt convincingly jell. In mood a certain delicacy and the sense of isolation both on a depopulated Earth and somewhere above it the recent film that this most strongly recalls is WALL-E except with violence and without the humor and charm of the Pixar classic. PHOTOS The Costumes of Tron There have been many films set on an Earth depleted of humans but few as visually enthralling as this one. Shot by Claudio Miranda of Life of Pi Oblivion shares that films lovely light nuanced coloration and virtually seamless meshing of live photography and effects. In neither film is it always possible to be entirely sure of what is real and whats computer generated but the result is beautiful however it breaks down. After what appear to be memory flashes of a previous life back in an early 21st century New York City on the part of Cruises Jack Harper he and his partner Vika (Andrea Riseborough) wake up in what can only take the prize as the ultimate loft space circa 2077 a perch thats the last word in minimalist chic. It also affords unobstructed views of whats been left behind after the catastrophe that saw the moon blown into pieces which in turn resulted in earthly ruin and a subsequent evacuation of survivors to Saturns planet Titan. Jack (Cruises second use of the name in a row after Jack Reacher) takes daily spins down to Earth in a bladeless mosquito-like helicopter while the British Vika tracks his movements and coordinates with headquarters personified on a screen by the friendly Southern-accented Sally (Melissa Leo). The self-described ""mop-up crew"" Jack and Sally who get on well have only two weeks to go before they finish up and head for Titan. On the ground Jack looks for any signs of Scavengers or Scavs who apparently were defeated in the great war but still provoke worries with their desperate ambushes. He also must avoid the radioactive zones which remain hot. Everywhere he goes however Jack is protected by drones fast-flying globe-like hi-tech wonders that are armed to the teeth and can reliably detect friend or foe. Jack seems to relish being haunted by the past. He wears a Yankees cap nostalgically wallows in lore surrounding the final Super Bowl played in 2017 while surrounded by the ruins of the stadium where it took place and uses the upper part of the Empire State Building which sticks out of the ground that has swallowed the rest of the structure as a sort of home base and control tower. Jack also is inordinately fond of a collection of highfalutin Victorian-era verse by Thomas Macaulay titled The Lays of Ancient Rome especially the line that reads ""And how can man die better than facing fearful odds."" Given that Jack seems to be the last man responsible for tidying up affairs on Earth hed better not die prematurely though there is someone or something down there that seems bent on catching him. STORY Tom Cruise Plans Imax Qamp;A to Promote Universal Pictures Oblivion The films delightful sense of apartness in the early going and the industrious way that Vika especially approaches her task of administering to the final business of Earth are things that cant last especially not after Jack brings home the one survivor of a mysterious crash of a spaceship carrying several hibernating humans. Once she wakes up and recovers Julia (Olga Kurylenko) throws a monkey wrench into life in the loft not only because she is so beautiful (Riseboroughs alarmed reactions to her are indelibly registered) but because she is an arrival from the past when she was Jacks wife. Revelations of what follows are best not detailed except to say that Morgan Freeman and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau respectively play the intelligent and impulsive members of a rebel band that soon captures Jack and Julia. As much as Jack aspires to recapture the past however and regardless of Julias evident purity of intent the renewed relationship doesnt click as intended mostly because its tough to buy the conceit of the couple reunited after so long. Further twists and betrayals lie in store but they feel more like obligatory plot complications than organic to the overall story. As a result viewer engagement gradually lessens leading to a climax that makes for thematic sense but dramatic head-scratching. Theres a bit too much manly stunt stuff the better likes of which weve seen in the Mission Impossible extravaganzas and elsewhere but generally Cruise plays it naturalistic and low-key here likable and to solid effect. Riseborough who was the one person worth watching in Madonnas wretched W.E. is an inspired bit of casting as she brings prim snappy delivery to many routine lines and irrepressible emotion to her later behavior. Kurylenko is more than plausible as a woman who would inspire recurring dreams in Jack while Leo has so much personality that she can burst right through the limitations of her video screen-only appearances and still register strongly. Technically the film is a dream; if Tron Legacy showed that Kosinski was right at home in an imaginary effects-created world then Oblivion reveals him as well along the road toward applying effects to even grander ends in this case to a story he originally conceived years ago as a graphic novel that was adapted as a script by Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn. The unconventional electronic score by M83 is terrifically effective for the first hour and maybe more until it starts becoming a bit repetitive.

Whatever its other shortcomings Kosinskis 2010 directorial debut Tron Legacy constructed a virtual-reality universe so sharply dressed and decorated it was hard to see why the characters kept trying to escape. He has repeated that trick in his follow-up Oblivion a sleek sci-fi playground of gleaming cloud palaces where French hipsters M83 provide the electro-classical beats and even Tom Cruises dirtied radiation suit looks runway-ready. Set in 2077 60 years after aliens supposedly laid waste to our planet and forced humanity into this chic sky shelter Oblivion suggests the apocalypse may not be all bad news. One person not delighting in this fashion-forward future is Cruises plaid-favouring Jack Harper a former Marine now plundering our scorched Earth for its few remaining resources. With memories of their past lives wiped Jack and his lover Victoria (Andrea Riseborough sadly playing little more than a switchboard operator with benefits) work dutifully under the command of Melissa Leos Sally - essentially HAL with a perky Southern drawl. But when one of Jacks missions turns up an oddly familiar-looking human time-traveller (Olga Kurylenko) from the year 2017 he is forced to question the rules of his existence. The audience meanwhile will be questioning what those rules are in the first place particularly when Harper is pursued by a parallel human race that has no obvious need for him. Like a haute couture designer with no grasp of ready-to-wear garb Kosinski continues to lavish far more thought on how his elaborate fantasy worlds look than how they work and neither the politics nor the human stakes here coalesce into rational or relatable drama. Oblivion finally plods even as it dazzles; a flick through Kosinskis sketchbook would be quicker and equally impressive.

I am not always that keen on Tom Cruise but he was really good in this.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 16 2013SPHFeaturedThe audience meanwhile will be questioning... why they even wasted the money and time coming to see this it doesnt make sense has more plot holes than Swiss cheese its boring and predictable. The raison detre for this movie seems to be that they needed to give Cruise something to do with himself.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 16 2013wildkatwriterFeaturedThis starts with surely the clunkiest piece of exposition in cinema history and people keep explaining the plot - trouble is whenever they do we realise it doesnt make much sense. There are holes in this that you could fly a spaceship through and the Big Questions (like why would anyone who lives in a cave feel the need to wear sunglasses?) are never answered. Tom Cruise and Andrea Riseborough are a lonely maintenance crew preparing to leave a nuked and ravaged Earth but Cruise keeps dreaming of a mysterious woman. Then he finds her. Then he finds Morgan Freeman smoking cigars and being enigmatic and realises - a good deal later than the audience - that Things Are Not What They Seem. The cliched script seems to have been dictated mostly by Cruises demands (""I will have two wives I will speed around on motorbikes and mini-spaceships to remind people of TOP GUN I will be a maverick who breaks the rules I will try and save the dog""). Though it has a comparatively tiny number of characters in the best sci-fi traditions - cf. 2001 ALIEN SOLARIS SUNSHINE EVENT HORIZON etc - Kosinski never takes advantage of this to develop them in any depth or detail. The three female characters (two more than in a lot of genre pieces admittedly) are particularly underwritten. Riseborough is the nagging we-must-do-it-by-the-book wife; Kurylenko is purely decorative and spends most of the time with Cruise lovingly putting her into cryogenic sleep (aah - what a romantic) and the excellent Melissa Leo is stuck being the voice of the computer - though she gives it a menacing cheeriness that makes it the best performance. If you want to be thrilled scared surprised or engaged you better see something else - Duncan Joness MOON for example which has infinitely more imagination on a tiny tiny fraction of the budget.. ""Oblivion"" could be where Cruises career is headed.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 16 2013GortFeaturedOMX This is Tom Cruise tailored movie I can see how it was made Tom Cruise phoned some producer and said ""Hello I want make a movie."" Producer ""OK m. Cruise you still have somewhat bankable name. What can we do for you?"" Cruise ""It has to be an action movie because Im too bad of an actor to be in drama for instance. I mean I tried that but failed and was very boring. People loved me most when I flew jets so could you make me a pilot? And also since Im very old it would be ridiculous if I flew in contemporary plane and army so make it SF. And see I also want to save the world because I want people to like me and then join Scientology so you could also take some of that dogma of people being asleep and then waking up to the truth. In the matter of fact Ill play a character like that so that people can see what it is to join Scientology... I mean wake to the truth. Also put a romance in it because at first we didnt have it in Top Gun there was just me but then test screenings audience demanded it so put it in right away to save on time."" Producer ""OK mr. Cruise. Anything else?"" Cruise ""Yeah do something about design. I heard that Apple is pretty popular these days so maybe you could design it to look like an Apple store. For instance with me fighting robots that look like Macs and Ipads."" Producer ""All right. Right away mr. Cruise.""FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 14 2013IanFeaturedI have just seen this in Imax and whilst it looks amazing visually in that format it doesnt hide the fact that the plot is a bit by the numbers. At the heart of it this is a simple film which seems to have been patched together from a number of other films. Like the Tron film Kosinski delivers something spectacular to look at but it is all a little empty. The scene where Cruises character realises what is going on was done much better in Moon and a number of other exposes dont really come as too much of a surprise. Also the final reunion scene is a huge cliche. Till then I enjoyed it. Its good but not great. An enjoyable 3 star film all the same.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 14 2013Cole EssexFeaturedI saw this film last night having read this review before hand I wasnt expecting what I found. A really good film and yes you have to have a certain suspension of disbelief for all films and this is no exception. I found the story was good (although sometimes a bit sentimental). But the film held me considering that there are only 4 principal characters they all played their part and Tom Cruise was great. The styliing the visuals and the soundtrack was wonderful (I bought it today on iTunes). This film isnt ground breaking but that doesnt mean to say its a Turkey... far from it. Go see it and enjoy it... FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 13 2013EricFeaturedIf you start analysing why exactly this or that happened precisely in that way in this movie youre not going to end up satisfied. If you look for plot holes youll find them but thats far from saying this is a dumb movie. Theres a certain suspension of disbelief required to enjoy this kind of movie but most of us are easily capable of it (otherwise explain The Avengers being the second-highest grossing movie ever) and if you manage it unlike poor Mr. Lodge you get a film with an original intelligent sci-fi story incredible visuals and three very good actors. I can think of much worse ways to spend time in a cinema. Would give 3.5 stars if it were possible.

In the vastly improved version shown locally Harper does not ""plunder"" the earth his ""hideaway"" has a collection of household items presumably found when landing to repair drones furthermore the parallel race has a blindingly obvious need in their general plan to capture one of these flyboys. To say much more would be to let loose spoilers and this film does have a story which continues through to an acceptable ending though I might wonder why an inter-stellar intelligence would settle on the precise strategy shown. All the same it is far better in my opinion than the severely over-hyped illogical Prometheus perhaps the best Cruise film I have seen so far.

To say much more would be to let loose spoilers and this film does have a story which continues through to an acceptable ending though I might wonder why an inter-stellar intelligence would settle on the precise strategy shown. All the same it is far better in my opinion than the severely over-hyped illogical Prometheus perhaps the best Cruise film I have seen so far.

Pitting the latest action-hero incarnation of Tom Cruise against an army of alien marauders director Joseph Kosinskis follow-up to ""Tron Legacy"" is a moderately clever dystopian mindbender with a gratifying human pulse despite some questionable narrative developments along the way. The less-than-airtight construction and conventional resolution may rankle genre devotees though hardly to the detriment of robust overall B.O. Getting the blockbuster season off to an early start on April 19 when it opens Stateside in wide release and in Imax theaters ""Oblivion"" reps the latest test of Cruises bankability coming mere months after he tried on a new ass-kicking persona with ""Jack Reacher."" This time hes Jack Harper and without giving too much away theres an amusing perhaps unintended existential subtext here about the somewhat interchangeable men of action Cruise has played over the course of his career. Still the actors first foray into science fiction in eight years (if you dont count ""Rock of Ages"") comes with a more intriguing backstory than most. Its the year 2077 six decades after the people of Earth fought and vanquished an evil race of space invaders called Scavengers. But victory has come at a great cost. The planet is now an uninhabitable post-nuclear wasteland and Jack (Cruise) is one of the last men still stationed on Earth a fighter pilot/technician assigned to fend off stray Scavengers and repair the powerful drones overseeing a massive hydroelectric energy project necessary for the survival of the human species. It all looks and sounds a bit like a live-action remake of ""Wall-E"" right down to the way the protagonist spurred by natural curiosity and an unexpected love interest finds himself on a dangerous unauthorized mission. Until now Jack has worked effectively enough with Vika (Andrea Riseborough) who guides his repair jobs with cool formidable efficiency from the glassy confines of their high-tech home base (referred to as the Skytower though it might as well be called the iPad). But unlike his partner Jack is a dreamer and a bit of a poet someone who cant help reminiscing about the past or questioning everyones future. Haunted by pre-apocalyptic visions of a beautiful mystery woman (Olga Kurylenko) he cant quite grasp why humanity having won the war has decided to permanently abandon its native planet for an uncertain future in space. As he steers his sleek pod-like aircraft over a landscape of eerie desolate beauty dotted with craters and radiation zones as well as lush unspoiled lakes and valleys Jack cant quite shake the feeling that all is not as it appears to be despite the chipper directives coming from the mothership (represented by a crackling TV image of Melissa Leo boasting a deceptively sweet Southern drawl). Indeed the audience will likely have a clear sense of whats going on long before scribes Karl Gajdusek and Michael DeBruyn (working from a 2005 short story that Kosinski later developed into a graphic novel) get around to spelling things out; suffice to say the title refers to more than just the physical aftermath of Earths cataclysmic destruction. Apart from an initial burst of neo-noir narration and a few moderately pulse-quickening action sequences one of them set in the impressively imagined ruins of the New York Public Library the first half of ""Oblivion"" adopts a spare unhurried approach that conveys a powerfully enveloping sense of Jacks isolation. Kosinski wastes no opportunity to linger -- and you cant blame him -- on his alternately seductive and staggering visuals richly conceived by production designer Darren Gilford and filmed with marvelous fluidity on the new Sony F65 digital camera by Claudio Miranda (following his Oscar-winning work on ""Life of Pi"" with another accomplished integration of cinematography and visual effects). This patient narrative strategy works well enough until Jacks big questions finally start to yield answers - many of them delivered as answers so often are by the sage presence of Morgan Freeman - and the storys underlying thinness and predictability gradually become apparent. The superficial cleverness of the plotting with its elements of amnesia self-delusion and impossible yearning at times gestures in the direction of a Christopher Nolan brainteaser (as does the surging score by French band M83 which sounds like electronified Hans Zimmer). But the lack of comparable rigor ingenuity and procedural detail is naggingly evident as is the almost feel-good manner in which the story explains away some of its morally troubling implications. If ""Tron Legacy"" offered up an eye-popping playground with more videogame potential than human interest ""Oblivion"" despite similarly immersive environs provides greater moment-to-moment dramatic involvement. Cruise combines his usual physical agility and daredevil stuntwork with one of his more affable characters in a while a high-flying dreamer trying to figure out mankinds place in this brave new world. Although much of the picture is essentially a one-man show Riseborough locates the blood and passion beneath Vikas icy surface while Kurylenko brings flickers of feeling to an underwritten role. Kosinskis architectural background is apparent in the pictures suave rounded design concepts and clean coherent compositions the effect of which is gloriously enveloping in Imax. Insofar as ""Oblivion"" is first and foremost a visual experience a movie to be seen rather than a puzzle to be deciphered its chief pleasures are essentially spoiler-proof.

Akorn44 says April 24 2013 at 1217 pm what Kim implied I cant believe that any body able to get paid 9153 in a few weeks on the computer. have you read this site Snap11COM Reply Margaret says April 21 2013 at 356 pm Well Ive done post-graduate work in mathematics ... but Im still baffled by Oblivion. Either Ill see it again or Ill wait for the Netflix/DVD. I overall loved the movie ... especially the imagery and set design ... WOW And what I grasped of the story I loved. But the timeline and how all the various events came together over the previous 60 years Im still confused about. Personally I thought the acting was decent and the future home(s) and bubble-craft ... awesome But I still dont have a clear concept of the movies backstory i.e what was supposed to have happened when why and how. I dont want to give any spoilers ... so Ill just leave it at that (and maybe go hunt for a blog or something where theyre discussing the plot backstory etc). Reply Stephen says April 16 2013 at 806 am Just saw it in Bangkok knowing nothing about it except the movie posters looked cool and my friend said it was good. I loved it. Loved it. For a humans v. aliens movie its a surprisingly intimate and focused storyline (like Moon?). EXCEEDINGLY good visual design music and sound design (especially those drones). No plot holes I can think of. All the extra layers of design details draw you into the world like Star Wars. My diagnosis the critic has seen too many movies recently. He makes accurate-enough comparisons to other movies but manages to make them drip with undue negativity. And the fact that you can guess what might be revealed 10 minutes later doesnt make it a stupid movie. Take a break go snorkelling then come back to the movies with a fresh perspective. This movie really is a pleasure. Reply Ames says April 15 2013 at 1202 pm Excellent review.

Reply Luis smit says April 12 2013 at 1038 pm I saw it and one of the most boring film . Ive seen Tom s movie and this is the most boring. Its a waste of money . I would not recommend it . Reply Richard Leynes says April 12 2013 at 1252 pm I saw this movie last wednesday (April 10) here in the Philippines.. First and foremost I am a fan of Tom Cruise especially when he is acting in sci-fi movies (minority report war of the worlds) and so I was really looking forward to see this film. However I have no idea what the movie is all about there were no viral marketing and cast interviews for this movie even trailer for the Oblivion was limited so I went to the cinema without knowing what to expect.. Well I think it was a blessing in disguise because releasing another trailer or interviewing cast members would really spoil the whole story no wonder the director and the rest of the crew were very secretive about the plot. Anyway I really love the story. At first I really had no idea where the movie would take the audience especially me but as the story progressed it became clear to us. I do not know about you guys but the plot was simple yet it really impressed me because I did not expect those things to unfold. It blew my mind it felt like ""inception"" but set in a post apocalyptic future. It really blew my mind. And so I am now convinced that Joseph Konsinki is a great director especially a writer. His previous film Tron was okay visually but I am not really a fan of the franchise and so I did not fully enjoy the film but its different in Oblivion. The story is rich and I love how it surprised me. To be honest I just came home from a party and I only slept for two hours then I decided to go to see the movie. I dozed in the first few minutes of the film but when elements were gradually revealed my brain opened wide so I could fully grasp the rich story.. I am looking forward to see the movie again. Reply Deborah Moran says April 11 2013 at 402 pm I love Tom Cruise and his incredibly passionate portrayal of his characters. He was mesmerizing as Stacie Jaxx in Rock of Ages and I am definitely going to be one of the first to see Oblivion Yea for looking forward to some lovely escapism Reply Josh Cook says April 10 2013 at 924 am Wow. In the first sentence of this review where they mention the studios desire to refrain from let on too many plot details JustinCChang manages to provide the biggest spoiler. I dont usually read Varietys reviews but Ive been excited to see this movie so its the first time Ive clicked on a review link. I regretted it immediately. I understand that spoilers leak over time (dont tell anyone what Rosebud really is) but the movies not even out yet and I can guess the big twist already. Not cool. Reply Michael Sillion says April 11 2013 at 601 pm Well I dont read Reviews or watch Spoiler Trailers before seeing a really like see any more. Nothing is ever spoiler free Reply Sheldon Roth MD says April 10 2013 at 920 am Justin Changs review is superbly written (as usual). I read Mr. Changs reviews for the pleasure of good reading. His alliterative style elevates understanding deft precis analyses even handed mood encompassing scope makes the case for Variety versus Twitter. Reply sbob says April 10 2013 at 1024 am Sheldon -- are you being paid by Chang. I find he is smitten with himself and his own self-satisfying reparte -- and other than sketching out the narrative of the story (which he was invited not to do) has really very little to offer.
