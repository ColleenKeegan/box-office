Joe Neumaier Thursday March 13 2008 557 PM Horton Hears a Who Animated tale of an elephant trying to save a world of tiny creatures. From the Dr. Seuss book. With the voices of Jim Carrey Steve Carell Seth Rogen. (128) G. Villainy and nasty threats. At area theaters.Among the fantastical allegorical not-always-translatable books of Theodor Geisel aka Dr. Seuss ""Horton Hears a Who"" is a lesser light. The Grinch is a cinch to quote and the Cat in the Hat is all that and more. Then there are the Sneetches the Lorax and that perennial graduation gift ""Oh the Places Youll Go""Yet its the simple-but-brave elephant Horton who goes to the place Hollywoods been aiming for. The team behind ""Ice Age"" capture the Seussian visuals without squishing emotions or squelching the sing-songy language. Listen closely Its the sound of a million Who fans cheering. Jim Carrey the goof on the loose in 2000s hit ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" lends just his vocal cords here as the pachyderm who finds a microscopic world atop a clover. The tiny town of Whoville is presided over by the harried mayor (Steve Carell) who has to lead his family of nearly a hundred and fight town elders determined to keep the masses distracted even if disaster is imminent. Which it could be - and how - when Whoville is deemed Hortons hallucination by an authoritarian Kangaroo (Carol Burnett) then snatched up by a bad eagle (Will Arnett). As anyone whos ever had the book read to them at bedtime knows every Who has to speak up if theyre to be saved. ""Horton"" avoids the live-action pitfalls of Carreys ""Grinch"" and Mike Myers 2003 ""The Cat in the Hat"" which jammed their stars personas into overcrowded freak shows. (""Cat"" especially was like a bad acid trip). In happy animated contrast is Carell giving an affectionate subtle performance. The mayor is a bumbler but not a sap and has decency to spare. Seth Rogen Jonah Hill and Isla Fisher lend cute vocal support. In comparison Carreys motor-mouthed Horton is mainly a blustering sight gag. And the ""Shrek""-like pop-culture riffs arent needed in a universe this unique. But the computer animation is lovingly layered and the books moral to stand up and be counted arrives intact matched by a message to enjoy imagination. Children will like the broad comedy used to stretch out a thin tale while adults may relive their youth through the sound of the familiar rhyme-rhythms (Geisels best stuff was published between 1950 and 61). When even a snippet of those are heard in ""Horton"" everyone no matter how big is a kid again. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

The computer-animated feature based on Seusss ""Horton Hears a Who"" from Blue Sky - the outfit behind the ""Ice Age"" cartoons - is frequently charming beautifully drawn and far more faithful in spirit to the source material than those dreadful Ron Howard-Brian Grazer productions. Jim Carrey who overbearingly played the Grinch is in comparatively restrained form as Horton a genial elephant who lives in the jungle of Nool with his mouse buddy Morton (Seth Rogen). One day Horton discovers a speck of dust on a clover thats actually a tiny planet - where mini residents live in a town called Who-ville. Horton is somehow able to hear the much disrespected mayor of Who-ville (a terrific Steve Carell) but nobody else can. Especially not the overbearing Kangaroo (Carol Burnett very good) who thinks Horton has a delusion that poses a danger to the social order of Nool. By some accounts Seuss (aka Theodor Geisel) intended ""Horton"" published in 1954 at least in part as a political commentary on the times with Kangaroo a surrogate for Communist witchhunter Sen. Joseph McCarthy. While that political subtext will still resonate for boomer parents this cartoon is also a delight for their kids with beautifully rendered images of Nool and Who-ville and the books original beguiling rhymes recited as narration by the perfectly chosen Charles Osgood. The simple story has Horton trying to save Who-ville from extinction by predators and from Kangaroo arguing more than once that ""a persons a person no matter how small."" (Geisel adamantly pro-choice once sued a pro-life group that appropriated his slogan). Meanwhile in Who-ville the mayor is having a hard time convincing the skeptical populace that Horton even exists much less that theyre in danger unless they come together in a community effort. Seuss short books barely provided enough story for half-hour TV specials (an animated ""Horton"" aired in 1970) so makers of features always have to pad things out with action sequences and in this case some clever visual gags. Screenwriters Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio (""The Santa Clause 2"" ""College Road Trip"") have added lines for characters voiced by Will Arnett Dan Fogler Isla Fisher Jonah Hill and Amy Poehler. But they and directors Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino thankfully never stray far from the creators gentle whimsy in ""Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who"" HORTON HEARS A WHO For kids of all ages. Running time 88 minutes.

Directed by Jimmy Hayward Steve Martino. With the voices of Jim Carrey Carol Burnett. Now playing in New Jersey. THREE STARS There once was a doctor very funny named Seuss Who wrote about elephants a Grinch cat and moose And after his passing some tales went to buyers With deals in their fists for Jim Carrey Mike Myers They had pots of effects and huge piles of money They had lots of stars and they thought theyd be funny Except the films made had no touch of the magic The pictures were sad -- well in fact they were tragic They made the sets ugly and super expensive The high points were few and the lows quite extensive The new ""Cat in the Hat"" looked puffy and creepy The ""Grinch"" made us feel at once cranky and sleepy Until some new producer and boy this was smart Said Then why dont we try this -- lets use the Docs art Forget the bad makeup the guest stars so dated We could sketch them all and just go animated And so the elephant Horton faithful and true Now arrives on the screen just as Dr. Seuss drew Along with the Whos and the Wickersham brothers The nasty bird kangaroo and all the others And while the cartooning is now super high-tech Even true-blue Seuss fans cant dismiss it as dreck Its kept close to his style and his sense charm and wit It stays true to his memory (well most of it) Hortons nose is prodigious his ears flap like tents The Whos are all charming their inventions immense If theres a nit we must pick (and oh yes we must) Its that the Docs plot the new scribes do not quite trust There are jokes about Kissinger old-movie pokes Will anyone get these except fifty-ish folks? And the moral is laid on a little too thick Where Doctor Seuss used a feather -- they use a brick And yet past the poor puns and not-so-great choices There are still some nice pics and spectacular voices Including Jim Carrey (again) as dear Horton And even Seth Rogen as scaredy-mouse Morton Plus frazzled Steve Carell as the mayor of the Whos And Carol Burnett as the most mirthless of $?roos This Horton is silly (in mad love with his ears) And Carrey is funny for the first time in years Hes not wrapped in ego or painful pretension Or ""singing"" with body parts too crude to mention Instead he just voices this most marvelous beast Who has respect for everyone even the least And thats a lesson worth teaching to one and all That a persons a person no matter how small And a motto moguls should take some time learning If theyd like their movies to finally be earning For its not the cash that makes a prize of the art But the warmth of the tale and the size of the heart Rating note Theres nothing here to scare even the small and Jim Carreys jokes are scrubbed clean for all.

Related That Old Feeling Seuss on First Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Seated behind me at a critics screening of Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who were a well-known movie reviewer and her date a young child. At the end the child audibly in rapture asked ""Did you love the movie?"" ""I love that you loved it"" was the nicely evasive reply. But the child was persistent. ""Will you give it a rave? Will you give it four stars?"" Im with the kid. I hearted Horton laughing at the funny parts welling up at the inspirational bits. For the story concocted in 1954 by childrens author Ted Geisel has more than a few messages all of which resound 54 years later. The book is about belief in what you cant see fidelity to a cause that others think is ridiculous and community service to reach an improbable goal. Were all in this together Seuss says; everyones important. Or as Horton puts it ""A persons a person no matter how small."" The new version from 20th Century Foxs Blue Sky Studios (Ice Age Robots) shows a pleasingly Hortonian faithfulness to the original story; and the process of fleshing it out Geisels anapestic rhymes to feature-film length seems smart sensible and organic. Narrated by Charles Osgood of CBS Sunday Morning and making superior use of the voice talents of Jim Carrey Steve Carell Carol Burnett Seth Rogen Will Arnett and others the movie proves a funny elevating ride that should beguile the young and keep their parents or grandparents enthralled too. For once the G rating stands for Glorious. Universes within universes -- the interdependency of all living things everywhere -- is Geisels theme in Horton. In the Jungle of Nool something foreign lands on a piece of clover. Its not a spaceship but an entire alien world the nearly infinitesimal planet of Who-ville. Horton the elephant his large ears giving him the most acute hearing detects cries from the clover speck. He cant see the little Whos but he deduces believes knows that sentient creatures are in there; and his caring instinct tells him that they must be protected. He builds a rapport with the tiny planets resident scientist Dr. Hoovey who is having just as much trouble convincing his villagers that theres a giant outside force unseen but benevolent that will determine their future. Horton is a naturally generous soul; in an earlier Seuss story Horton Hatches the Egg he had stolidly perched on an irresponsible birds egg and stayed at the job for nearly a year because he had promised he would. ""I meant what I said and I said what I meant An elephants faithful one hundred percent."" This time his mission is even more perilous. He must fend off the agnostic scorn of prime jungle bureaucrat Jane Kangaroo and her simian minions the Wickersham brothers. Kangaroo charges a ""black-bottomed eagle"" to fly the speck to a remote spot and dump it in a giant field of clover where Horton would have to overcome tremendous odds just to locate it. Actually the Who-ville speck would be quite safe in that field (which might be home to three billion tiny worlds). For Horton to bring the Whos back to the jungle will surely put them in renewed danger. But Horton must be not just the hero of the story but the teacher of its moral. Both are large and satisfying indeed. In 1970 the book became a handsomely detailed TV perennial directed by Chuck Jones the Warner Bros. animation genius who had worked with Geisel on the wartime Private Snafu cartoons and in 1966 brought Dr. Seuss How the Grinch Stole Christmas to the small screen. This Horton was narrated by another old Geisel colleague Hans Conried the actor who had incarnated that pedagogue-demagogue that piano-teacher torturer Dr. Terwilliker in Geisels fantastical live-action film The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T. And you shouldnt miss the elephants first appearance in movies in the Warners cartoon Horton Hatches the Egg directed by Bob Clampett. This wonderfully vigorous adaptation can be found on YouTube. (But dont let the kids peek at the next offering on the YouTube list the non-Seuss very Spitzer-sounding Horton Hires a Ho.) The Blue Sky version is directed by Jimmy Hayward a Pixar veteran who worked as an animator on that studios first five features and Steve Martino. They have elaborated on the TV shows designs to develop a dense gorgeously goofy Who-ville -- a town of bright colors and sweetly tilting towers that might have been dreamed by Antonio Gaudi and Red Grooms. Who-ville has a daft architectural logic that makes a comely contrast to the jungle lushness of Nool. The films big narrative change is to turn Dr. Hoovey into the cheerful desperately busy increasingly addled Mayor of Who-ville (voiced by Carell). On top of his day job the Mayor has 96 kids to whom he can devoted only 12 secs. each at breakfast time. After all those girls he had a son JoJo a silent sulking lad in Goth attire. (In the original and JoJo was unrelated to the main Whovian -- just ""a very small shirker"" who performs a crucial role at the climax.) So the movie combines two kinds of parenting literally as the Mayor and JoJo find a project to bring them together and figuratively as Horton (a fine vocal job by Carrey) grandly represents the kindness of strangers. In the early scenes fastidious viewers may be wearied by a glut of comic references -- to movies of the 50s (The Thing from Another World) and the 70s (Apocalypse Now) -- that should probably be deleted from the anything-for-a-joke book. The movie also briefly and unnecessarily invokes the voices of Henry Kissinger and JFK. But ransacking pop culture is what cartoons do and not just the gag-strewn Shrek movies. Clampetts Horton Hatches the Egg has a Katharine Hepburn bird a Peter Lorre fish (that commits suicide) and the Horace Heidt novelty hit ""The Hut Sut Song."" Even the more restrained Jones ended his Horton with a twist on a twist of John Philip Sousas ""Stars and Stripes Forever."" The cast sings ""Be kind to your small-person friends"" a variation on the ""Be kind to your web-footed friends"" chorus from ""Crazy Mixed-Up Song"" a novelty hit of the 50s performed by two other stars of Dr. T Peter Lind Hayes and Mary Healy. In the Seuss universe as in Hortons everyones connected. The new Horton movie also has a very contemporary front-page vibe. In their years preparing the film Hayward and Martini couldnt have anticipated the political connection but the bossy Kangaroo (voiced by Burnett) seems strangely like Hillary Clinton. ""That Hortons a menace"" she says adding as if it were a crime against humanity. ""Hes got rabbits using their imaginations"" The lady does all in her nattering power to sabotage Hortons mission and sends out her surrogates -- the Wickersham monkeys acting like so many fractious Ferraros -- on a whispering campaign against the idealistic elephant (who in this case should probably be a donkey). Yet the movie keeps the audience rooting for idealism for the unlikely hero for the audacity of Horton. These accidental campaign allusions and the old-jokes meant to keep senior members of the audience in the loop soon subside as the film starts parading its strong story sense and its plethora of heart. Theres an old-fashioned suspense sequence in which Horton tries to navigate a rickety rope bridge thats as well choreographed as any action scene from an Indiana Jones movie. So is the climax with the Who-villagers shouting in desperate chorus to save both their world and their benefactors life. I wont say its emotionally wrenching but the man sitting in front of the child at the screening was bathed in tears. You may leave the movie with Seussian anapests dancing in your happy head. Heres mine A treat for the eye an epic event/ This film is delightful one hundred percent.

The look of the story is an undeniable treat and the message it weaves is both funny and sweet. Horton Hears a Who is razzle-dazzling and artful and it builds on Seuss words by the clever cart-full. One senses that the good doctor would be pleased with this cinematic treatment of his beloved 1954 book. The voice talent was well-chosen and the computer-generated animation is gorgeous vibrantly hued and surprisingly textured particularly the many kinds of rippling and lustrous fur (a notoriously tough thing to render digitally). TRAILER See what it is that Horton Hears Horton (voiced charmingly by Jim Carrey) is a cheerful big-hearted galoot of an elephant. One day as hes tromping through the jungle he hears a distant sound that appears to be coming from a speck of dust. Sure enough what he hears emanates from Who-ville an entire city contained on that speck. Horton is immediately intrigued and instantly ridiculed. Particularly threatened is a busybody kangaroo (a very funny Carol Burnett) who insists that anything outside her narrow world must be evil. Horton bravely faces his detractors. He communicates with the mayor of Who-ville (Steve Carell) who is derided on his end for believing that hes talking to an unseen elephant. The storys message of standing up for yourself and respecting others opinions comes through powerfully in this imaginative adaptation. Horton has a simple explanation for why he is willing to withstand the slings and arrows of the controlling kangaroo and her court ""A persons a person no matter how small."" Writers Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul skillfully weave in the poetry of Seuss actual words with their amusing dialogue. Equally noteworthy is how the animators capture the visual magic of Seuss distinctive and stylized illustrations. They also build ingeniously upon Seuss rich fantasy world Horton fashions his big floppy ears into a bathing cap before diving into a lake. Later his trunk becomes a shower nozzle. Hortons definition of the term ASAP -- ""Act swiftly awesome pachyderm"" -- suggests sage advice to moviegoers Act swiftly and go see this awesome pachyderm strut his stuff.

Sony Pictures Classics By Joe Morgenstern Updated April 22 2011 1201 a.m. ET This is the film that should have won an Oscar in its foreign-language category this year and didnt. Its languages are French and Arabic but theres nothing foreign about its substance or its shattering impact. Denis Villeneuves screen adaptation of a play by the Lebanese-Canadian playwright Wajdi Mouawad tells a story--masterfully--of courage cruelty family mysteries and a chain of anger that can only be broken by love. Watch a clip from the film Incendies courtesy Sony Pictures Classics ""Incendies"" which means ""scorched"" starts with a dramatic device worthy of Agatha Christie (and ends with one worthy of Sophocles.) A Montreal notary summons the twin children of a recently deceased woman from the Middle East for the reading of her will. The twins Jeanne and Simon arent surprised about the distribution of their mothers modest estate; its to be divided equally between them. But theyre astonished when the notary hands them a pair of envelopes for delivery--one to the father theyd assumed was dead the other to a brother theyd never heard of. To find these shadowy figures Jeanne followed later by her brother Simon embarks on a Middle Eastern odyssey thats intercut with the story of their mother Nawal; she is brought back to life in a glorious grand-operatic performance by Lubna Azabal. The actress and the role deserve each other in the best way. Nawal grows from a passionate girl in a backward village to a college student a nonviolent activist for peace a violent activist for peace and then a prisoner so ruthlessly brutalized by her captors that she becomes known as La Femme Qui Chante the woman who sings through her pain to keep her sanity. The film was shot in Jordan--Andre Turpin did the inspired cinematography--though the locales arent specified; indeed the country isnt named. Nevertheless Nawals life is clearly intertwined with the agonies of Lebanon that culminated in a Christian militias massacre of Palestinian refugees in 1982. And it doesnt matter that the logic of the warfare may be difficult to decode. What ""Incendies"" sets forth so powerfully is the biblical nature of sectarian violence--retribution leading endlessly to more of the same--and Nawals struggle to live a principled life in its midst. The ending literally derives from Sophocles with all that implies of drama heightened--sometimes uncomfortably--to the level of myth. Its all the more remarkable then that Mr. Villeneuve and his superb cast keep the action grounded in the moment-to-moment realities of the siblings quest--of the detective story really--as they cross the chasm that separates generations and slowly discover who their mother was. Jeanne is played by Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin and Simon by Maxim Gaudette. Remy Girard is the notary in a film that makes a compelling case in passing for the role that notaries have played over the centuries in keeping historical records and tracing family connections. Watch a clip from the film Water For Elephants courtesy 20th Century Fox starring Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson Water for Elephants How do I count the ways this movie goes wrong? Maybe by starting with the pictorial rightness of a circus train pulling into town in Depression-era America Rodrigo Prietos cinematography gives the whole production an evocative beauty that it never earns dramatically. The circus of ""Water For Elephants"" isnt supposed to be the Greatest Show on Earth but it might be expected to resemble the exuberantly tawdry microcosm of Sara Gruens novel with its fiery lovers fascinating freaks unregenerate brutes and a menagerie dominated by a fancy-dancing linguist of an elephant named Rosie. So much for expectations. These lovers Robert Pattinsons Jacob and Reese Witherspoons Marlena generate less heat than a naphtha stove. These freaks are noted only glancingly. (The fat lady doesnt get to talk let alone sing.) The brutes have been combined into one bipolar monster that a surpassingly subtle actor Christoph Waltz (the Nazi colonel of ""Inglourious Basterds"") has been directed to play coarsely. And the director Francis Lawrence--working from a screenplay by Richard LaGravenese--blows the moment when Jacob finds the key to Rosies behavior What was a magical discovery in the book becomes a mildly intriguing plot point. ENLARGE Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon in Water for Elephants. Twentieth Century Fox The film starts going wrong in a ""Titanic""-like prologue with Hal Holbrook as the aged Jacob looking back on his life. His performance is too big the camera is too close the scene is being sold to the audience instead of offered to it. But thats nothing compared to the too-muchness of Mr. Waltzs evil ringmaster August and the too-manyness of the doting closeups devoted to Mr. Pattinson who does far more reacting than acting in a movie that keeps insisting on the obvious. Its a tiny point but that insistence even infects the moment when Marlena finds herself a ladder in order to climb aboard Rosie for the first time. ""Can you help me with this ladder?"" she asks Jacob as if he might not recognize a tall narrow thing with lots of rungs. Meeks Cutoff Kelly Reichardts marvelous minimalist epic which is entering national distribution this week amounts to a master class in the power of observation. Much of the action--the outward action since a lot goes on in peoples heads--is seen and barely heard in long shots. The pace matches that of the characters three families in a wagon train moving slowly toward Oregon in 1845. (At least the families hope theyre headed for Oregon since their guide a mountain man named Stephen Meek has taken them on an unmarked path and theyve lost their way.) Yet you watch with unswerving attention. ENLARGE Shirley Henderson Zoe Kazan and Michelle Williams in Meeks Cutoff. Oscilloscope Laboratories Meek who is played with layered extravagance by Bruce Greenwood is part of the reason the movie is intrinsically dramatic. Is Meek to be trusted or is he the blowhard he seems increasingly to be? But the other component of Jon Raymonds brilliant script presents an equally fateful alternative--an Indian wanderer who may lead the pioneers to the water they must find or to their deaths at the hands of his unseen tribesmen. Insisting on nothing ""Meeks Cutoff"" operates on faith in our concern for understated yet complex issues of trust fear empathy ignorance versus evil the mystery of authority and the role of The Other in an encounter between civilizations. Ms. Reichardt conveys all of this with her own serene authority. The flawless cast includes Michelle Williams Will Patton Paul Dano Shirley Henderson Zoe Kazan and Rod Rondeaux. Christopher Blauvelt did the cinematography which is luminous by day and mysteriously dark by night. Jeff Grace composed the score an austere symphony of woozy swoops. POM Wonderful Presents The Greatest Movie Ever Sold Morgan Spurlock has come up with a terrific idea--a movie about product placements that depends completely on product placements for its financing. He admits from the get-go that hes selling out then insists that such transparency proves his integrity. The full title gives POM Wonderful its own line because the makers of the pricey pomegranate elixir paid 1 million for above-the-title naming rights. (Hats off to them not only for getting the joke but helping promulgate it.) Most of the movies substance consists of Mr. Spurlocks campaign to find backers--hes an engaging pitchman--but he also discusses matters of ethics (while slugging down bottles of POM Wonderful) with such deep thinkers as Noam Chomsky and Donald Trump and with Ralph Nader who warns that ""you can satirize and spoof yourself out of your objective."" Its good advice but Mr. Spurlock doesnt need it. He spoofs himself into an exuberant documentary that demonstrates the all-pervasive influence of modern advertising by satiric example and with great ingenuity--talking for example about product placement while hes placed in such products as a JetBlue terminal (where he slugs down a bottle of POM Wonderful.) During the course of the film he helps us understand why school districts like the one in Floridas Broward County stoop to selling ad space on their vehicles and fences (they know theyre bending though they dont consider it stooping.) Toward the end he favors Mr. Nader with a pair of Merrell shoes. In the interests of transparency I should say that I left the screening with a swag bag full of placed products and used one of them Mane n Tail shampoo on my hair the following morning. Although Mane n Tail was originally developed for horses I cant tell you how clean it left me feeling. In Brief Jeanne the single mother at the center of ""Fly Away"" lives with incipient crisis. Her teenage daughter Mandy (Ashley Rickards) is autistic and that incipience can give way to utter chaos without warning. Janet Grillos modestly produced feature breaks no new ground in depicting those who live with autism--both the afflicted and their loved ones. So much is so familiar--the sudden terrors the financial pressure the beckoning prospect of institutionalization the unanswerable question of how to have a life of ones own while caring for an autistic child. But Beth Brodericks lovely portrayal illuminates Jeannes loneliness and the steadfastness of her love.    Cy Harvey who died last weekend at the age of 85 opened my eyes and lots of others to foreign films. Along with Bryant Haliday his partner in the Brattle Theatre off Harvard Square he founded Janus Films the distribution company that introduced a generation of Americans half a century ago to the work of such directors as Ingmar Bergman Francois Truffaut Jean-Luc Godard Federico Fellini and Akira Kurosawa. While its hard to recall what the film scene was like before Janus its easy to remember the thrill of discovering the companys releases. The Roman god Janus faced two ways but Janus the distributor taught me to look only one way--forward with anticipation. ENLARGE DVD FOCUS Caramel (2007) Once known as the Paris of the Middle East Beirut isnt all bombings and political upheavals. Nadine Labakis beguiling debut feature a small-scale comedy of sisterhood is comprised of urgent intimate vignettes about five women who meet at or work at a Beirut beauty salon called Si Belle. All but one of the actresses who play them are nonprofessionals--not unprofessional just untrained in the craft--and they are to a woman enchanting. (The film takes its title from a sticky mixture used in Lebanon as a depilatory.) Ms. Labaki the professional plays Si Belles owner. Horton Hears a Who (2008) Jim Carrey is the voice of Horton the elephant in this animated feature from Blue Sky Studios the company thats currently flying high with a blue macaw named Rio. The film turns enchanting when it plunges from the jungle of Nool into the cheerful pandemonium of Who-ville the microscopic civilization atop the white speck that Horton finds perched on a pink clover blossom. (Chuck Jones did a TV version of the Dr. Seuss classic in 1970.) The voice cast includes Steve Carell Carol Burnett Will Arnett Amy Poehler Seth Rogen Jonah Hill Dan Fogler and Isla Fisher. Super Size Me (2004) Morgan Spurlock took on the fast-food industry--and took the measure of this nations obesity--by eating three meals a day only at McDonalds for one month pigging out on the full caloric sweep of the chains menu and agreeing to have orders supersized whenever a counter clerk asked. The result was a substantial weight gain surprise surprise; a spike in blood cholesterol and a likable documentary that puts American portion control in vivid perspective. The only other movie to do that more graphically is ""WallE"" with its extraplanetary leisure world of grotesque waddlers. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Photo Blue Sky Studios Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who 1 / 2 Back to Gallery On the 14th of March from the Land of L.A. Comes a film based on Seuss that Im happy to say Isnt overblown junk like The Cat in The Hat - A movie that messed with the book and fell flat. This time Seuss work rendered in CGI Has the look and the feel and the wonder oh my Of Ted Geisels creations imagined as though They were sculpted from toothbrushes foam and Play-Doh. The hero is Horton and he Hears a Who - A whole city of Whos who cant think what to do When the speck that they live on dislodged from a bloom Rumbles and tumbles portending great doom. They dont know its a speck that they live on of course Until Horton the Elephant yells till hes hoarse And gabs through a drainpipe with a muddled wee Mayor (Whos voiced by Steve Carell with vertical hair). But the Whos they refuse to believe him and Horton Stuck with a Seth Rogen sidekick named Morton Finds himself mocked in the Jungle of Nool As a fibber a ninny a rebel a fool. Will Horton a pachyderm full of great spirit Get the Whos to safe haven (or anywhere near it)? Will the snide Kangaroo and a bicuspid vulture Persecute Horton and destroy the Whos culture? Will infinitesimal Whos win them over Belting out ``We are here from their speck on a clover? Or will bossy marsupial Carol Burnett Hold a kangaroo court until everyones dead? Oh suspense Oh the drama Oh the quick-fired wit From Jim Carrey as Horton who acts up a bit With riffs on Apocalypse Now and John Kennedy Yet projects Hortons innocent cuddly identity. The film co-directed by one Jimmy Hayward And video-game man Steve Martino isnt wayward But REO Speedwagon? In Nool? Well thats strange. And a Pokemon-esque 2-D clip seems deranged. But with Charles Osgood narrating and nods to old Seuss The movie seems updated without playing too loose. Though the dialogue is mainly in modern-day prose There are rhymes from the book that most anyone knows. And the heart of the movie like Hortons remains One of sweetness and kindness and so it maintains Its message of courage and love ``After all ``A persons a person no matter how small. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Tactical Cree XML 4000-Lumen LED Flashlight for 8 + free...

But in ""Horton Hears a Who"" the genius of Theodor ""Ted"" Geisel has finally made it to the big screen in ways that charm but do no harm to the the good Dr. Seuss rhymes and delightful reasons. And directors Jimmy Hayward and Steve Marino even conclude their animated pleasure about a heroic pachyderm protecting a mote that contains a world with an REO Speedwagon power ballad. It doesnt get much better than that. 1/2 RATING | Animated Family Film When we meet Horton (voiced by Jim Carrey) he is twisting his ears into a bathing cap and taking a dip in a jungle pool. Horton is constantly fiddling with those ears of his. And it is with these flappers that he famously ""hears a Who."" Uppercase of course as in the small beings who inhabit the speck Horton carefully places on a clover. The Whos and the bustling burg of Who-ville are not small to themselves. Indeed the mayor and the City Council are preparing for an anniversary celebration when Hizzoner (Steve Carell) notices something is amiss. With determination and faith in each other Horton and the Mayor become allies across the great divide of the massive and the minuscule. Speaking of wee the mayor is trying to bridge a different gap as he reaches out to Jo-Jo his son the littlest Who and the lone boy in a family of 96 girls. Returning to animation to capture Dr. Seuss imaginative worlds helps tremendously in making this movie enchanting. Live-action letdowns ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" and ""The Cat in the Hat"" were hobbled by star turns -- Carreys and Mike Myers -- that overshadowed the true star Seuss terrific imagination. The utterly different yet parallel realms of Horton and the Whos of Who-ville are rendered in all their complex computer-generated glory by Blue Sky Studios makers of ""Ice Age"" its sequels and ""Robots."" The jungle of Nool evokes in this viewer the fresh romance of Henri Rousseaus paintings. Who-ville a world of odd curves and angles honors Seuss exquisite illustrations. Kudos to Carrey for this darling second go-round. His Horton is not only loving and lovable he is also heroic in everyday and grand ways. He is a funny generous teacher. And the children of Nool look forward to their lessons. One of Hortons students Katie looks like the love child of an Easter Peep and a blowfish. While this may sound scary shes truly weird and magical -- in other words positively Seussian. For one Nool parent Hortons popularity is suspect. Marvelous Carol Burnett plays misguided Kangaroo (who ""pouch- schools"" her son). She exploits fear of difference then solicits the aid of a hip-unto-himself vulture named Vlad (Will Arnett) and the Wickersham clan and its leader Yummo (Dan Fogler) to oust Horton. Thats a euphemism. The roster of voice talent could have readers of credits fretting. After all a number of the roles belong to Judd Apatow regulars -- Seth Rogen (""Knocked Up"") Jonah Hill (""Superbad"") even Carell. Its a relief then that writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio have fun with the belief that all humor doesnt have to be of the wink-nudge variety to appeal to adults in the plex. ""These luxury condos dont build themselves"" says a construction foreman before Who-ville rattles and they do. ""I love the smell of bananas in the morning"" shouts Horton dodging Yummos fruity ammo. The films depiction of parallel universes has its tour-de-force moment when Horton braves a ravine while the mayor sits in his dentists chair for a root canal. Wooden planks. A gaping maw of teeth. Forget chaos theorys riff on butterfly wings. This is the interconnectedness to fantastical and comical degree. Suspiciously blue-rinsed the Wickersham apes might remind some of freakish simians from cinemas vault of wonders. Kangaroo herself has the superiority complex of a certain snooty Kansas denizen. Echoes of ""The Wizard of Oz"" aside ""Horton"" isnt derivative. Like its hero the movie is heroically loyal. ""A person is a person no matter how small."" Indeed. And thanks to ""Horton Hears a Who"" we are again reminded that a wonderful movie is a wonderful movie no matter how G. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor March 14 2008 Save for later Saved Furballs From left Tommy Katie Mrs. Quilligan and Jessica in the vibrant new Dr. Seuss courtesy of blue sky studios          View Caption About video ads View Caption of For some bizarre reason I was not brought up on the Dr. Seuss books even though by age and temperament I should have been. My loss.As a result watching the new animated feature ""Dr Seuss Horton Hears a Who"" was like living out a second childhood when I hadnt quite experienced the first.Not that I am unfamiliar with the Seuss books - its just that I read most of them as an adult. As I said my loss. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The good news here is that ""Horton"" directed by Jimmy Haywood and Steve Martino wonderfully captures the Seuss-ian - or is it Ted Geisel-ian? - world as full-scale animation. The CGI visuals not only serve Geisels story they also much more important capture his imaginative leaps. This is an animated movie that unlike the recent ""Shrek"" series for example doesnt try to play up to adults while playing down to children. It also mercifully doesnt insert product placements even as satire - another dubious legacy of the later ""Shrek"" movies. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Horton is a wholly Seussessful adaptation The best family-oriented animated movies are almost always the ones that treat the audience as one happy band of enlightened kids. With ""Horton"" as the signpost its easy for an adult to locate his or her ""inner child.""Horton (voiced by Jim Carrey) is an elephant who hears a faint cry from a speck of flying dust and discovers that the speck is actually a planet with a city called Who-ville. The voice of alarm belongs to Who-villes daffy Mayor (voiced by Steve Carell). Horton takes it upon himself to relocate the speck to a safe sanctuary - because ""an elephants faithful 100 percent.""And if that wasnt enough for you theres also Hortons motto ""A persons a person no matter how small.""The sheer galumphing bigness of Horton is used to great comic effect. He contrasts beautifully if only in our imaginations with the teensy inhabitants of Who-ville. (Horton and the Whos hear but never see each other.)By insisting that the speck houses a city Horton is the laughing stock of his own world the jungle of Nool. The Kangaroo who believes ""if you cant see something it doesnt exist"" is particularly derisive. And since she is voiced by Carol Burnett - who you may recall does a pretty mean Tarzan yell - you can be sure the derision is outlandish.The inhabitants of Who-ville are equally skeptical of the Mayors Horton-inspired claims that their planet is in peril - even after things go topsy-turvy and it starts snowing in summer.In addition to Kangaroo the film is festooned with other marvelous creatures including Kangaroos chief henchman Vlad (voiced by Will Arnett) a scrappy eagle who sounds as if hes auditioning for ""The Godfather"" and best of all Dr. Mary Lou Larue a purple-haired nerdette with thick safety glasses who alone among Who-villians believes in the Mayors alarms. I dont wish to give offense here but it certainly doesnt hurt that Mary Lou is voiced by that famously small bundle of energy Isla Fisher. (Shes 5-foot-2.)""Horton"" connects with children in the best possible way by respecting their inquisitiveness (and their smallness). More so than with most animated family films it proffers life lessons but so charmingly that we never feel as if were being lectured to.I dont wish to overstate the pleasures of ""Horton."" It doesnt approach the lyrical heights of which the medium is capable and theres a conventionally animated ninja scene that doesnt come off at all. But its so funny and good-natured that I cant imagine anybody not smiling through it. Not even a Grinch. Grade A-Rated G.

"CGI redo nearly true to the Whos - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review CGI redo nearly true to the Whos (Blue sky studios) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / March 14 2008 Im probably being overly kind rating ""Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who"" as more than strictly average computer-animated kiddie fare but two things swayed me. First its a relief not to have to put up with Mike Myers as a cretin in a cat suit. Second after the Saturday morning screening I attended every 4-year-old stood and applauded. With a movie like this theyre the critics not me.If you have a kid or have ever been one you know the story. Horton (the voice of Jim Carrey) is a big gormless elephant lumbering happily through the jungle until the day he hears a voice coming from a dust-speck. On that speck is the entire village of Whoville and in that village is the Mayor of Whoville (Steve Carell).This is the kind of perspective-altering insight familiar to decades of dorm-room stoners and ""Hor ton"" lays it out straight ""Your whole world fits on a flower in my world - were in the middle of some amazing cosmic convergence"" Whoa.Unfortunately the rest of the jungle thinks Hortons hallucinating. Led by a fascist soccer-mom kangaroo (Carol Burnett) and the Wickersham Brothers - a tribe of rampaging blue simians who stand as Dr. Seusss most inspired vision of mob-think - the animals come after the elephant with a vengeance bent on immolating the speck in a vat of boiling Beezlenut oil. Apply the political witch-hunt parallels as you see fit.""Horton Hears a Who"" represents a fresh and mostly refreshing approach in Hollywoods pillaging of the good doctors oeuvre. Gone are the A-list stars in eye-sore make-up of Universals live-action ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (2000) and ""The Cat in the Hat"" (2003). Gone too is the witless vulgarity of a PG-rated Seuss flick desperate to pander to middle schoolers and teenagers.Apparently as appalled by those films as the rest of us Audrey Geisel (the authors widow) and her lawyers have handed over the new film to Fox Animation head Christopher Meledandri who understands that a Seuss movie doesnt have to be hip to work. Quite the opposite in fact.Working with Blue Sky Animation (""Ice Age"") Meledandri and directors Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino have cooked up a visually luscious CGI jungle for their mop-topped critters to galumph around in. The trees have three-dimensional depth but theyre recognizably Seussian in surrealist geometry; the animals mimic the authors sense of line and whimsy with a dash of oddball hyper-cuteness derived from Japanese anime.Even Whoville feels right all loopy buildings and impossible kiddie-Escher staircases. Theres a sequence involving a visit to the Whoville Observatory thats breathtakingly graceful - a fusion of Rube Goldberg Wile E. Coyote and Alexander Calder.At the same time ""Horton"" strains to fit in with all the other family ""product"" cluttering our multiplexes DVD players and landfills. The Whoville sequences have been turned into wham-bam slapstick the vulture (Will Arnett) is now a scary villain with a Russian accent and the less said the better about the Mayors ""sassy"" black secretary (Niecy Nash; Wanda Sykes must have been busy doing Applebees ads).As if ""I meant what I said and I said what I meant an elephants faithful one hundred percent"" (borrowed from ""Horton Hatches the Egg"") isnt enough an extra feel-good message has been tacked on in the form of the Mayors misunderstood son Jo-jo whos mostly silent a la Paul Dano in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" but who eventually - well lets just say hes voiced by teen singing heartthrob Jesse McCartney for a reason. Score one for the soundtrack CD.Carrey cant always keep the smarmy pop-culture cross-references in check (""I love the smell of bananas in the morning"" oy) and these deliver the expected easy laughs while betraying the essential simplicity of Dr. Seuss. Yet the overall tone is playful rather than forced and even when ""Horton"" takes a side-alley into an anime action parody I found myself laughing against my better judgment.Its a tough balancing act and probably a futile one. As greedily as Hollywood looks upon these books as a franchise to strip-mine the hard fact remains that whats good about them - Ted Geisels untrendy gentleness humor and intelligence - resists translation to the big screen.Which wont stop the studios from trying obviously. At least ""Horton Hears a Who"" understands that this storys moral - ""A persons a person no matter how small"" - applies to the customers in the booster seats.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune March 14 2008 -- 517pm Blue Sky Studios Associated Press In this image released by 20th Century Fox a still from the film ""Dr Seuss Horton Hears a Who"" is shown. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Tastier than a platter of green eggs and ham ""Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who"" is a pachyderm-sized helping of silliness and graceful imagination. Earlier big-screen adaptations have smothered the good doctors unpretentious whimsy under layers of production bloat. ""Horton"" from the producers of ""Ice Age"" feels as blithe and confident of its unpretentious virtues as its long-nosed hero. It ranks among the rare family entertainments that are both kid- and adult-friendly. Children might not realize how good it is but older viewers certainly will. Jim Carrey atoning for his strident 2000 performance as the Grinch hits a note of unforced charm as the elephant Horton. With ears large enough to hear the smallest of voices he becomes the ambassador between the parallel worlds of the jungle and the spec-sized planet of the Whos. After floating through space the Whos world has landed on a flower that Horton carefully protects. The snippy Kangaroo (Carol Burnett) questions his sanity and insists that he stop making claims about invisible Whos whom no one else can hear. On the submicroscopic level Steve Carell is the Mayor of Whoville a feline-looking creature whose rain spout is the outlet for Hortons voice. Prune-faced grumps on his City Council mock his warnings that Whovilles increasingly unpredictable weather reflects an approaching global warming-style mess. (If you object to veiled political themes in childrens lit the unrepentantly progressive Seuss is not your man.) Carell who does panicked out-of-control authority figures brilliantly is the ideal actor for the role. As a gargoylish vulture brought in to settle Hortons hash Will Arnett hisses and growls hilariously. The film boasts a Pixar level of attention to detail and overall quality. Veteran broadcaster Charles Osgood provides kindly-uncle narration. The animation and editing are top-notch pleasing audiovisual parallels to the authors wriggling lines and bubbly rhymes. The tenderhearted Buddha-bellied elephant makes an irresistibly cuddly hero and when he springs into superhero-style action in an anime sequence he proves a better flier than Dumbo. The architectural madhouse of Whoville with its candy-cane colors and thousands of eccentric citizens is a sublimely silly society. The only objection that can be raised is that the filmmakers continue Seuss inattention to female characters who function either as scolds or ciphers. The family-values subplot centers not on the Mayors 90-odd daughters but his mopey son who resembles a vanilla jellybean with emo boy-bangs. Nevertheless the lad displays some vital 11th-hour moxie. Saving the day here is strictly a male enterprise. DR. SEUSS HORTON HEARS A WHO  OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating G. All in all this is a spirit-lifting affair that proves that childrens films and quality neednt be contradictory terms.

Gray and grateful for his place in the universe The pachyderm breaks the Dr. Seuss movie curse. Seuss lovers - and who is not? - may now heave a sigh of relief. Unlike those behind the recent live-action grotesqueries The Grinch Who Stole Christmas and The Cat in the Hat the makers of the Horton Hears a Who a most genial animation do well by the great good medic of metrical writing. Even better they honor the smile-making delight of Seuss drawing style too. As any 5-year-old can tell you Hortons story is quite simple. While frolicking ""in the heat of the day in the cool of a pool he was splashing enjoying the jungles great joys when Horton the elephant heard a small noise."" From a speck on a dandelion Horton discerns two things. That there is a microscopic universe Whoville populated by imaginative builders whose convoluted engineering suggests that they are graduates of the Rube Goldberg College of Design. And that rumbles in the jungle can cause quakes and climate change in the infinitesimal Whoville. As any 55-year-old can tell you Hortons story is quite cosmic. For the pachyderm (voiced by an unusually serene Jim Carrey) takes it on faith that there exists a parallel universe that he can only faintly hear. And he remains firm in convincing doubters especially Sour Kangaroo (Carol Burnett) that though it cannot be seen Whoville exists. With a gentle hand the captivating and helium-light 88-minute film touches on issues of religious and scientific belief the Butterfly Effect (the notion that the flutter of insect wings might create small changes in the atmosphere that cause a tornado) global warming and peaceful coexistence. The under-6 set wont notice the storys covert agenda which is as relevant today as in 1954 when it was originally published.

Grinches have messed up recent live-action adaptations beyond repair I do not like The Cat in the Hat I do not like it fancy that. But this exuberant translation of the 1954 classic -- from the Blue Sky Studios folks who made Sisyphean drama out of a squirrel and a nut in Ice Age -- is true to the Seuss vision with a contemporary integrity that makes full use of CG power without sacrificing the delicacy of the authors springy zingy illustrations. The new Horton proves that in the care of a creative team prudent enough to keep the focus on the books timeless melange of eccentricities and ethics and steer clear of meta joking or condescension theres new juice to be squeezed from old Seuss yet. Certainly the excesses of the live-action Cat and How the Grinch Stole Christmas movies cant eclipse the durable genius of the good Doctor who in Horton has created one of literatures great pachyderm role models. One day ""in the Jungle of Nool"" as anyone who was ever an American child may remember the title elephant hears the tiniest squeak coming from the smallest speck floating through the air and discerns an entire universe in a dust mote. Its the residents of Who-ville he alone hears -- city folks in a vulnerable universe teensy enough for Horton to carry on the head of a clover flower. And so even though he cant see them Horton tenderly carries the Whos to safety despite outlandish obstacles in a jungle of naysayers led by a bullying bossypouch of a kangaroo. His explanation ""A persons a person no matter how small"" is a verity right up there with ""give peace a chance."" Accordingly the statement has been interpreted like a holy text. Completists may also want to track down Chuck Jones animated 1970 TV version. The actors who lend their voices to the film arent people we generally think of as working ""small."" But in a felicitous group effort guided by directors Jimmy Hayward (a Pixar alumnus) and Steve Martino (art director of Blue Skys Robots) comic powerhouses Jim Carrey (as Horton) Steve Carell (as the Mayor) and Carol Burnett (as the sour Kangaroo) temper their own full-throttle performances with an unironic respect for the original text. The backup players (among them Seth Rogen Will Arnett Amy Poehler and Isla Fisher) also swing in the breeze. The movies visual pep complements the nonconformist glee of Seuss line drawings. And when the entire population of Who-ville clangs and chimes to announce ""We are here"" loud enough to be heard beyond their city limits the noise is downright joyous.

SEUSS HORTON HEARS A WHO Running time 88 minutes Written by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul Directed by Jimmy Haywood and Steve Martino Starring Jim Carrey Steve Carell Carol Burnett Jimmy Haywood and Steve Martinos Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a Who with the help of innumerable collaborators is rated G which makes it O.K. for children of all ages. This presents a problem for me as a reviewer since I was assured by my parents that I was never a child even in the cradle where I assumed the expression of a Greek philosopher which is perhaps why I have never had children of my own. I have never read Dr. Seuss but I have always considered Walt Disneys Dumbo (1941) an adult taste. But there I was in the cavernous expanse of the Ziegfeld Theatre with all the little persons in New York sitting around me watching Horton an elephant with the trick voice of Jim Carrey. Horton reports hearing a clover blossom in his ear announce that a whole city of Whos governed by a mayor with the trick voice of Steve Carell inhabit the blossom. As Horton explains patiently to the jungle skeptics around him ""If you were way out in space and you looked down at where we live we would look like a speck."" I suppose so and I dont think it will do children any harm to become suspicious of conventional opinion or even conventional wisdom. And anyway who among us can resist an animated elephant or even a lethargic one?

It seems to be two Theres one thats quite Seussical gentle and charming. The other stars Jim Carrey brash and alarming What auds will attend? Who has what it takes? Wee innocent children -- and moms with headaches A story of Horton and people called Who -- but how many movies? It seems to be two Theres one thats quite Seussical gentle and charming. The other stars Jim Carrey brash and alarming What auds will attend? Who has what it takes? Wee innocent children -- and moms with headaches Helmed by Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino this large-scale big-effects animated take on the 1954 Dr. Seuss tale ""Horton Hears a Who"" (directed by Chuck Jones for TV in 1970) really does have a split personality. When Charles Osgood is narrating the very simple tale of the elephant with a big heart and big ears -- Horton can hear the tiny inhabitants of Whoville whose miniature world is in peril -- the story is quite innocent and child-friendly. Elsewhere not so much. The problem is the beloved Dr. Seuss (aka Theodore Geisel) didnt write movie-size stories -- his best-known cartoon adaptation ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" had to be padded and scored just to supply a half-hour of television. In the case of the new ""Horton"" it has fallen to scribes Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio (""College Road Trip"") to shall we say accessorize the good doctor. What we get is action for actions sake cartoon violence and a whole lot of hubbub. Despite the movies motto -- ""A persons a person no matter how small"" (Geisel once sued a pro-life group to stop them from using it) -- the film apparently needed such ""comedy giants"" (Foxs words) as Carrey Steve Carell and Carol Burnett to do it justice. This is a touchy issue and not just for the hundreds of vocal talents left unemployed by the craze for celebrity voiceovers; its unclear whether such names really mean much in the way of B.O. for animated films. And while someone like Jerry Seinfeld was probably indispensable to ""Bee Movie"" its hard to say what exactly Carrey Carell and Burnett bring to ""Horton."" The real stars of the movie are the animators who imbue even the overgrowth in Hortons jungle with a certain floppy Seuss-ishness. When the apelike Wickersham brothers are firing bananas out of their armpits the film attains Tex Avery-grade nuttiness. The visual gags are mostly just great great fun. A couple of the non-Seuss lines too are near-classic (""You take care of that meatball sir"" Carreys Horton tells Carells mayor of Whoville ""and leave the freakin out to me."") But the drive to overdo almost everything in the film only emphasizes how thinly stretched the story is and how movies almost always resort to violence and violent action when no one knows what else to do. Every time Osgood weighs back in with a few lines of Seuss (and not even all of the original ""Horton"" is used here) it imposes a sort of cultural whiplash. Pics producers seem to have been trying to make Carreys ""Aladdin"" hoping that his manic delivery like Robin Williams in that 1992 Disney film would be so in synch with the animation that it would lift auds right out of their seats. Not quite the case. No elevating moments but a few of pure mirth ""In my world"" says one of the films furry woodland creatures ""everybodys a pony they eat rainbows and poop butterflies ... "" Now that would be something to see. Dr. Seuss Horton Hears a WhoProductionA 20th Century Fox release of a 20th Century Fox Animation presentation of a Blue Sky Studios production.
