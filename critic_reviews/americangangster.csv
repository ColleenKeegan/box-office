David Lee/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption David Lee/Universal Pictures Denzel Washingtons heroin merchant squares off with a corrupt cop (Josh Brolin) in American Gangster. David Lee/Universal Pictures Director Ridley ScottGenre Crime Drama/ThrillerRunning Time 157 minutes (Requires RealPlayer) A sprawling mob epic that clearly wants to be a Harlem Scarface Ridley Scotts gangster flick aims high and mostly measures up. Ambitious engaging and occasionally even gripping it never adds much to the genre -- but it knows how to stroke genre tropes till they tremble. Denzel Washington is strong and reasonably persuasive as Frank Lucas a 70s dope king who if the movies version of this torn-from-magazine-headlines tale is accurate got the bright idea of bribing servicemen to fly thousands of pounds of heroin stateside from Vietnam during combat operations as if the U.S. military was his own personal FedEx. An initially outmatched narcotics agent (Russell Crowe) struggles to make minor inroads which eventually lead to a surprisingly big payoff. Director Scott crosscuts between their stories mining them for ironic parallels -- the gangsters a family man the cops a deadbeat dad both men are principled in their divergent ways -- and if the result isnt an instant classic its never less than engrossing.

Its worth epic treatment all 157 minutes of it. And right from the title Ridley Scott guns for nothing less than the twenty-first centurys first great crime saga the American dream re-cut as a New York dope opera.Doesnt it show. More hyper-aware than hyper-real Scotts meticulous aesthetics cant touch the urban texture and deep focus of The French Connection The Godfather Serpico and Prince of the City - all looming heavily in intertextual nods. Whats more writer Steven Zaillian strains to splice a Scarface rise and fall with a Heat-styled crisscross character-study as untouchable cop Richie Roberts (Crowe buttoned into a low-key role) toils to bring down Lucas (Washington) and the corrupt NYPD narcs. But for all the fractured mirroring this is Lucas story - and Washingtons movie. Hes immense centring every scene with tractor-beam charisma that dangerous easy charm hovering between a luxury smile or blazing violence.Like much of his oeuvre Scotts scaled-up movie is bigger than life - and lesser for it. But while never digging deeply or darkly enough to match its own grand vision of itself slick technique drives the story forward with pace and style. The finish rushes in a brilliantly constructed police take-down a magnetic collision between two Oscar-winning alpha males and a gift-wrapped coda which confirms that in Hollywood mythology always trumps morality.

Scott was trying to telegraph every inch of plot with loud fake mismatched sounds of symphony R amp; B and sound effects. Every once in a while he used a real song from the period like Across 110th St. with Bobby Womack singing. But he had a handful of club scenes with fake horrible R amp; B. What? Was he too cheap to pay for more originals. So that was the fakest thing [next to Joe Mortons hairpiece]. The other irritant to my eyes was the mixture of great scenes like Lucas offing the rival in broad daylight on a crowded street in Harlem in front of his brothers and his mother [Ruby Dee] standing up to him. Good stuff. The rest I swear I saw for sale at a Blockbuster 3/10 bin. I love integration and Hwood making a black-themed pic every so often. They dont get the music right cant bear to see the profundity in black life and cannot begin to understand how black people speak to each other in intimacy and love.

If it fails its not for lack of trying. Its based on the true story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) a cool brilliant ambitious sharecroppers son from North Carolina who worked his way to the top of the New York drug trade in the 1970s. Unlike his great Harlem competitor Nicky Barnes (Cuba Gooding Jr.) Lucas cut out the white middlemen--i.e. the Mafia. The Vietnam War was on and Lucas got his heroin direct from the source in Southeast Asia shipping his goods home on military planes in the coffins of American soldiers. His product Blue Magic outsold his rivals because it was purer and cheaper. It was also deadlier.Scotts movie written by Steve Zaillian regards the control-freak Lucas--a figure of dapper understated elegance and lethal viciousness--with a mixture of awe and fear. Theres nothing new about a gangster movie that both glamorizes and condemns its hero (a certain hypocrisy is built into the genre) but ""Gangster"" further hedges its bets by making the corrupt white cops (led by Josh Brolins loathsome Detective Trupo) far more odious than Lucas. It doesnt try to soft-pedal the human cost of Lucass success--grisly images of dead junkies abound. But at the same time it posits the pusher as a triumphant example of black capitalism the first African-American to get the Mafia to work on his terms. This tricky moral balancing act may be one reason ""American Gangster"" never fully ignites its a movie thats always watching its own shadow.Lucass story is crosscut with that of his pursuer the scruffy womanizing legendarily honest cop Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) whos put in charge of the NYPDs drug unit. As charismatic as Crowe is the cops story cant compete with the crooks. You have to wait until the end for these two stars to share a scene and when they do team up as odd-couple crimebusters it seems to belong to another movie. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week For all its grit style and atmosphere ""Gangster"" never sweeps you away. It has neither the lurid bravado of De Palmas ""Scarface"" nor the intimate grasp of the criminal lifestyle you find in Scorsese or Coppola. You stay with it because of Washingtons commanding presence. He gives us a man whose eyes miss nothing and his fire-and-ice performance demands we watch him with the same rapt attention.

But great its not. ""American Gangster"" wants to be a great epic crime saga so badly you can feel it. The true story at its core -- of the rise fall and redemption of a 70s-era Harlem drug lord -- is so terrific its amazing it wasnt put onscreen long ago and it would be difficult today to find two better actors to pit against one another as hoodlum and cop respectively than Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. With so many elements going for it this big fat Universal release is absorbing exciting at times and undeniably entertaining and is poised to be a major commercial hit. But great its not. Memories of numerous classics hang over this film like banners commemorating past championship teams -- ""The Godfather"" ""Serpico"" ""Prince of the City"" ""Scarface"" and ""Goodfellas"" among other modern-era crime-pic landmarks. Like most of those this is a quintessential New York story one you feel could have been the basis for a Sidney Lumet masterpiece. But while ""American Gangster"" is made with consummate professionalism on every level it just doesnt quite feel like the real deal; it delivers but doesnt soar. Based on a New York magazine article by Mark Jacobson the story arc is so sensational it warrants outsized treatment. Frank Lucas rose from Harlem crime-world minion to drug kingpin by bringing in uncut heroin straight from Southeast Asia during the height of the Vietnam War. At least the way the script tells it his steps were dogged by notably incorruptible working-class federal investigator Richie Roberts (a man not once mentioned in Jacobsons piece) and the upshot was the hammer coming down on the NYPDs drug enforcement cops three-fourths of whom were on the take. Steven Zaillians script plausibly lays the story out on parallel tracks following the two men until they finally meet very late in the game. Its an intelligent craftsmanlike job that coherently lays out a complicated multifaceted tale but also one that serves up genuine intensity and overblown aspects in virtually equal measure with director Ridley Scott following suit. Contrast between the two protags is neatly set up. Frank (Denzel Washington) driver and collector for legendary Harlem hood Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III classy) steps into the void left by his mentors death in 1968 by traveling to the jungles of Thailand and with crucial help from an Army relative transporting 100 kilos of pure heroin back to the U.S. via military planes. Eliminating any middleman Frank floods the streets with top-quality stuff undercuts the competitions prices and reaps huge profits. In an era of pimp-style flash and braggadacio Frank cuts an intriguingly low-key profile; he dresses conservatively eats breakfast alone early every morning in a local diner and seems not to indulge in his own merchandise. But when crossed he doesnt hesitate to administer punishment personally by shooting the transgressor himself in broad daylight. On the other hand Richie (Russell Crowe) is a sweaty scraping-it-together Joisy kid going through an unpleasant divorce and studying for a law degree when hes not chasing down drug dealers. He becomes the notorious exception to the rule in his profession when he busts a couple guys with a million bucks in the trunk and insists on turning it in. With little visible opposition Frank does more than his share to spread drugs and crime throughout New York. Pic barrels like an uptown express through this moral issue neither condemning the self-made entrepreneur nor excessively glamorizing him blaxploitation-style (the real Frank Lucas was by all accounts considerably flashier than Washingtons version allows). As Frank expands his empire he brings his five younger brothers up from North Carolina and proudly installs his dirt-poor mother (Ruby Dee) in a white mansion on a hill. Frank meets and marries Miss Puerto Rico 1970 (Lymari Nadal); puts would-be rivals at a polite distance (Armand Assantes Italian mobster who wants part of Franks action) or in their place (Cuba Gooding Jr.s Nicky Barnes Franks real-life Harlem competitor); and makes a return trip to Thailand to engineer the most ambitious import scheme of his career (although not nearly as breathtaking as the real mans alleged career-capper). To make an end run around the NYPD the feds recruit Richie to lead their own drug probe a move that bumps Mr. Clean up against top cop Det. Trupo (Josh Brolin) in some of the films most jolting interludes. Trupos brazen sense of entitlement to a cut of everyones drug profits is jaw-droppingly audacious and its played to the hilt of threatening menace by Brolin who steals scenes from even Washington and Crowe. With this and his splendid turn in ""No Country for Old Men"" Brolin has graduated to the bigs this year. But its when Richie in a spectacular raid on Franks factory nails his prey and Washington and Crowe finally end up across a desk from one another in a small room that ""American Gangster"" achieves maximum voltage. What goes down during their exchanges proves all the more engrossing thanks to the shrewd underplaying of these two terrific actors both of whom rise to the occasion when pitted opposite the best. Still theres an irony in that good as he is Crowe is essentially miscast as the tenacious working-class Jewish kid who brings Frank down. Having an actor of Crowes stature play Franks adversary helps balance the film but this is one of the few roles hes played for which he brings nothing special to the table and which does not allow his considerable charisma to flourish. Similarly miscast is director Scott whose greatest strengths lie in bringing to life grandly conceived portraits of distant worlds past and future rather than in contemporary realism. Maximizing a gritty big-city story requires a credibility composed of thousands of small details and this is one area where a citizen-of-the-world director like Scott cant excel. Its akin to asking Lumet or Scorsese to make a definitive film about crime in 70s Newcastle -- they could do a respectable even exciting job of it but it probably wouldnt ring deeply true. Still Washingtons steely grip on his impersonation of Frank Lucas holds the film together. Even if he doesnt entirely give the impression of a street hustler who never attended school in his life Washington presents a man of striking thoroughly credible contradictions cool businessman/explosive killer loner/family man engaging guy/scourge of society. Awash in blues functional lensing is something of a disappointment coming from the usually distinctive Harris Savides. Though it achieves a decent momentum pic feels its length.

"American Gangster Disorganized crime | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAmerican Gangster Disorganized crimeIn a fall season thats seen the mini-revival of the two most ritualistically brutal of classic American genres - the western and gangster movie - fascinating parallels abound.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. Nov. 2 2007 (out of 4)Starring Denzel Washington Russell Crowe Josh Brolin Chiwetel Ejiofor Lymari Nadal Ted Levine Armand Assante Cuba Gooding Jr. Written by Steven Zaillian. Directed by Ridley Scott. 157 minutes. At major theatres. 18A   Article Continued BelowIn a fall season thats seen the mini-revival of the two most ritualistically brutal of classic American genres - the western and gangster movie - fascinating parallels abound.Just as 310 to Yuma and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford represented the popcorn and poetic aspirations of the cowboy movie so David Cronenbergs Eastern Promises and Ridley Scotts American Gangster demonstrate the bipolar tendencies of the organized crime epic. But where the two recent westerns reminded us of the vitality of frontier as a form of both entertainment and experimentation the contrast between the two gangster movies illuminates the innovative brilliance of one at the expense of the dull-witted derivativeness of the other.Where Cronenbergs terse Russian mob saga is a worthy post-Sopranos riff on criminal tendencies Ridley Scotts listless Big Statement is a wheezy hot air-inflated dud. Once attached to Training Days director Antoine Fuqua American Gangster clearly has a history as a TD-tinged dark-side Denzel movie an intention the opening scene of Washingtons 1970s heroin kingpin Frank Lucas torching a man alive teasingly suggests might be borne out. And it might well have but in the process of becoming a Ridley Scott movie written by the man (Steve Zaillian) best known for Schindlers List and co-starring Russell Crowe American Gangster seems to have lost its mojo. In the transition to becoming a multiple Oscar-winner showcase American Gangster appears to have lost not only its edge but any sense of purpose and direction the result being a tedious three-hour saga so uncertain of its own reason for being it has to keep reminding us what its two main characters are about. Thus Washingtons Lucas who has upset the American underworld apple cart by cutting out the middleman to directly import junk from Vietnam must reiterate his psycho status by suddenly going mental every two or three scenes and Crowes incorruptible working-class cop Richie Roberts must have his rogue cop credentials re-issued nearly as often. Its like watching a movie that keeps forgetting what its already told you.Tracking Lucass rise to Harlem Godfather in tandem with Roberts history of stainless incorruptibility (a seemingly forgivable tendency to serial skirt-chasing aside) may only be the movies first mistake but its also the most fatal.Apart from the perplexing question of what makes this cop (besides the fact hes played by Crowe) worth half the movies time theres an equally vexing issue of why the whole movie isnt Frank Lucas. If it was we might actually learn something about the man. Instead American Gangster veers with metronymic tediousness between the Frank and Richie stories. With Scott demonstrating no native affinity to the genre and Zaillian resorting to such thunderously obvious dialogue as ""This is America"" and with both Oscar-frightened stars trapped inside characters that trade equally in established personas and cardboard archetypes American Gangster is an act of criminal negligence.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsPrince William and Kate coming back to Canada this fallRoyals are scheduled to come to British Columbia and the Yukon but no word on whether they will bring their children.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME The ruling cliche in writing about crime bosses -- ""the gangster as tragic hero"" -- was coined in 1948 by Robert Warshow an extremely intelligent cultural critic whose premature passing in 1955 robbed us of an invaluable voice. Warshow held that the classic movie mobsters (Little Caesar The Public Enemy) were in their essence classic Americans forced by their status as the sons of immigrants to seek success and status outside the law even though their style and motives were not so very different from the robber barons who found their riches in more respectable industries. The difference between the gangsters and say John D. Rockefeller was that their methods of eliminating the competition was shall we say somewhat more strenuous and that ultimately they paid a deadly price for their depredations. It has been 59 years since Warshow wrote and it seems to me that studies of the modern criminal have not advanced very much in that time. As evidence we might consider Ridley Scotts American Gangster which is based on the true story of a drug lord named Frank Lucas who in the 1970s cornered the Harlem heroin market and thereby made millions upon millions. He is a black man no less a member of a struggling underclass than his Italian and Irish movie predecessors and he has a couple of gimmicks that they (who were never drug dealers) didnt have. For one thing he eliminated the middle men; he bought his smack directly from sources in Southeast Asia and smuggled it into the country often in the body bags containing the remains of American soldiers killed in Vietnam. For another thing he ""branded"" his product as ""Blue Magic"" which was a purer and cheaper product that his competitors offered. Finally Frank who is played with a smooth coolness by Denzel Washington that eluded the more rough-hewn Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney does not come to a tragic end. Eventually he is turned by an almost comically obsessive cop named Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) does some jail time and loses his fortune but remains available to tell his story. In Washingtons soft-spoken gently smiling and ingratiating performance he is altogether more charming than most of his predecessors; it comes as a real shock when he must off a competitor or a betrayer. And we enjoy seeing him enjoy his success -- the gigantic mansion in which he installs his formerly dirt-poor family his trophy wife the celebrity that comes to him. There has never been much point in deploring a gangsters rise; its his demise that we fear -- the notion that the American go-getter must inevitably be gotten. ""Mother of Mercy is this the end of Rico?"" Robinson moans at the end of Little Ceasar --as surprised as we are by a death that may be tragically ordained but is also a sop to conventional morality. Thus perhaps ironically American Gangster Steve represents an improvement on gangster myth. In truth crime kingpins tend to lead long lives interrupted by a little jail time (Franks life sentence was commuted to 15 years). It is also improved by the fact that Crowes bumptious character comes to enjoy the mans company even becoming his attorney when he leaves law enforcement. Its the old Dostoyevskian bit about cop and crook being brothers under the skin. In the film the only truly loathsome villain is a crooked cop Detective Trupo played with wonderful brutality by Josh Brolin who encourages us to think that the only real crime is to interrupt the smooth flow of criminal entrepreneurship. Warshow observed that the classic gangster dramas punished their protagonists not so much for their unlawful activities but because they dared to succeed. He implied that we may seemingly worship success in this country but that we also deplore and envy it -- since most of us never attain it. But that was then and this is now. Our love affair with wealth and fame is now untrammeled by doubts. It is our big good thing and eventually Crowes character like the rest of us must surrender to its cheerful demands. That makes American Gangster which is rather leisurely paced but richly detailed in the way it pursues the minutiae of conspicuous criminality as well as consumption a more disturbing movie than its makers may have intended. I dont think it attains the Godfather level -- it lacks dark passion and grand-scale irony -- but it is an intelligent well-made and seductive movie.

Rated R for violence language drug use nudity sexuality. Several theaters. Although it simmers too long during the buildup phase Ridley Scotts epic crime drama ""American Gangster"" eventually pays off during the final reels. Steve Zaillians screenplay based on the true story of a 1970s Harlem drug lord initially suggests a series of familiar events in search of a story line. As scenes reminiscent of ""Scarface"" ""Serpico"" and ""Bugsy"" drift by you sense the ambition of the film if not the achievement. And then it all begins to click Denzel Washingtons spookily unpredictable performance as the homicidal drug dealer Frank Lucas; Russell Crowes warts-and-all portrayal of Richie Roberts the conflicted but committed cop who took him down; and especially Zaillians insistence on drawing parallels between Lucas rise and fall and the end of the Vietnam War and demise of the Nixon administration. The frequent use of television clips of Vietnam turning points seems gratuitous at first but the movie eventually makes its case. There was after all a direct connection between Lucas and the Southeast Asia drug trade. He insisted on going to the source and cutting out the middle man -- and when the American presence ended in Vietnam his business model was threatened. Scotts use of ""Amazing Grace"" on the soundtrack as Lucas faces this inevitable crisis will offend some and delight others. Its one of many devices Scott and Zaillian use to keep ""American Gangster"" from becoming just another tale of murderous drug dealers and the cops who try to outwit them. The movie begins with a particularly nasty demonstration of Lucas ruthlessness as a gasoline-soaked victim is torched and shot and it includes frequent reminders of the characters willingness to use violence to establish his authority. Washington pours on the charm in several scenes in which Lucas is dealing with his bride and family attending a landmark prizefight (""Its not boxing but politics"" he points out) and playing a role as Harlems Robin Hood. But the actor makes it perfectly clear that Lucas is always capable of brutality even within his frightened family. Scott guided Crowe to an Oscar in ""Gladiator"" and once more he brings out the actors vulnerable side. Crowe is particularly affecting in an episode in which Roberts confronts a barking racist militarist and in a divorce-court scene in which he acknowledges that hes not much of a parent. The exceptional supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr. as a rival dealer; Armand Assante as an aggressive mob boss; Josh Brolin as a corrupt police detective; Chiwetel Ejiofor as Lucas nervous brother; and Ruby Dee whos sublime as their troubled mother. ""American Gangster"" may not have reached its final form. Like so many of Scotts movies (the current reworking of ""Blade Runner"" being the most extreme example) its likely to improve as we get to see more of what he left on the cutting-room floor. (Surely theres more to Dees performance than we see here.) Call it a most promising work in progress.

"American Gangster Denzel Washington not ruthless enough as drug lord - Mercury News Hot Topics San Diego cop killed Big Sur fire Michael Parros Lake Tahoe warming Keith Urban Alphabet hiring Star Parties Facebook tax bill Brock Turner case Ask Amy SV150 Print Email Font ResizeAmerican Gangster Denzel Washington not ruthless enough as drug lordWASHINGTONS PORTRAYAL OF DRUG LORD LACKS REQUISITE RUTHLESSNESSBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 11/01/2007 052935 PM PDTUpdated 11/02/2007 042926 AM PDT Even in its overreaching title ""American Gangster"" asserts for itself a sort of thug manifest destiny an epic grandeur to which its hyper-local story of Harlem heroin kingpin Frank Lucas is unsuited. And in its title character the movie has created a murdering dope-slinging millionaire from the streets that even Denzel Washington has managed to make boring. Washington is so technically adept so eminently watchable that this isnt obvious right away. His portrayal of Lucas has a superficial sheen of charisma of command. But it slowly becomes obvious that Washington has decided he wont glamorize Lucas or glorify a career that led to the destruction of so many lives in his own community. And that in turn drains the life out of the picture. What ""American Gangster"" lacks is the ruthless crime lord its title promises and thats because Washington evidently has chosen to emphasize Lucas buccaneering business instincts. He kills rivals without apparent remorse and erupts in sudden violent rages but even those spasms feel contained efficient. Frank Lucas should project dread but there is little of the menace here that Washington brought to Alonzo Harris the rogue cop in ""Training Day"" for which he won an Oscar. That film was directed by Antoine Fuqua as this one was going to be until Fuqua terrified the studio with a 100 million budget. He was replaced by Ridley Scott who ended up making the movie for 100 million.Advertisement Scott is one of those directors who is always interesting even when hes bad as he has been in a recent run that includes ""Matchstick Men"" ""Kingdom of Heaven"" and ""A Good Year."" He isnt bad here but he isnt great. And neither is ""American Gangster."" The movie opens with a scene that feels as if it has been tacked on to demonstrate Lucas ruthlessness both to us and to his mentor drug kingpin Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson (played by an uncredited Clarence Williams III). Bumpy then takes his protege to a Harlem discount appliance store where he seems to be delivering a metaphor-rich aria about the loss of Mom and Pop heroin dealers when he sits down and dies. Lucas wants to take over Bumpys business but he needs a gimmick and gets it when he hears a news report about how the Vietnam War is turning American soldiers into dope fiends. He immediately heads for Thailand where he plunges deep into the jungle and buys a large shipment of heroin. The general who sells it to him accustomed to dealing with the Mafia asks Lucas how he plans to smuggle the drugs into the States. Even though this part of the story is well known (in part from being used in the marketing of the movie) the scheme Lucas devises is withheld so it can be revealed later in a scene that turns out to be more deflating than climactic. In the great Warner Bros. gangster pictures of the 1930s the police were rarely more than foils for the bootleggers who ran New York. But we are nowadays a nation obsessed with law enforcement. Presented with a story about one of the most ingenious and operatically violent criminals of the 70s ""American Gangster"" reflexively turns into a movie at least half of which is about the cop who goes after him. That investigation is led by Richie Roberts a detective played by Russell Crowe a star almost as big as Washington which means the movie is obliged to bounce back and forth between Lucas and Roberts while one establishes himself as the new Superfly and the other as the incorruptible new Serpico. This would be a difficult narrative feat under any circumstances. But Crowes half has so many complicating subplots - Roberts is studying to be a lawyer he angers his fellow cops when he finds a bag containing nearly a million dollars in the trunk of a car and refuses to steal it and hes battling his soon-to-be-ex-wife (Carla Gugino) for custody of their son - that the movie feels like a series of disconnected scenes - color-coded in ebony and ivory. Into this scrum marches a crew of dirty cops from the Special Investigations Unit led by the movies one authentic-looking gangster Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin). Not content to just shake the dealers down Trupo has been stealing the notorious ""French Connection"" drugs out of the police property room and wholesaling his own dope. Trupo is the only character who moves freely through the two movies that make up ""Gangster"" and its his greed that finally knits them together. But the movie has been going on for an hour and a half before Roberts even finds out who Lucas is and its two hours before Washington and Crowe are finally on screen together. There is a charged moment when they do finally meet but by the time their one long scene together rolls around the movie feels as if its winding down. Until then Scott keeps cutting back and forth frantically trying to give the two leads equal weight. But his heart isnt in it; you can feel the movie tilting toward Washingtons character even if it never tilts quite far enough. Washingtons performance should have made that a practical necessity but it doesnt. No one would suggest an actor of Washingtons stature should conform to any gangster prototype least of all the florid modernism of Al Pacinos Tony Montana in the 1983 remake of ""Scarface."" But if Washington doesnt want to play someone as tawdry as a gangster he should let someone have the part who will.

Photo David Lee / Universal Studios Gangster Frank Lucas (DENZEL WASHINGTON) helps outcast cop Richie Roberts (RUSSELL CROWE) understand the level of corruption in American Gangster. Photo David Lee / Universal Studios Photo Ho Review Crowe Washington face off in American Gangster 1 / 1 Back to Gallery American Gangster Crime drama. Starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. Directed by Ridley Scott. (R. 157 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) ""American Gangster"" doesnt quite live up to its title. Yes its about a gangster and yes hes American but the movie isnt emblematic in the way the title implies nor does it tell a great American story. Ridley Scott gives it the grand treatment 157 minutes worth but in the end it doesnt stack up as the portrait of an era (the 1970s in this case) or an important tale of a criminal mastermind. So its not a classic say like ""Scarface"" the 1983 De Palma film. Instead it can be classed as a respectable second-tier entry our decades equivalent of Michael Manns ""Heat"" (1995) with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Like Manns picture this one has a couple of huge stars Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe one as a cop and one as a crook. And the movie follows the trajectory of each as one tries to catch the other. The impressive thing about ""American Gangster"" is that it lives up to the challenge imposed by the structure A movie that follows two separate guys and two separate stories needs to be sure that both guys are interesting so that when the narrative switches from one to the other its never a letdown. Well its never a letdown. Washington and Crowe would come in tied in any charisma-animal magnetism-star quality runoff and screenwriter Steven Zaillian keeps the competition fair by making both characters equally compelling. Extremes are always fun and so the movie sets the terms in the first scene even before the credits. Frank Lucas (Washington) heroin lord of Harlem pours gasoline over a guys head and sets him on fire. We never find out who the guy is. The incident is never referred to again. Its just there as a little marker a glimpse of Frank having an average hard day at work. Richie is extreme too but in the other direction. Hes the kind of guy who finds a million dollars in a bag and turns it in. (And this is in the early 1970s when a million dollars was a million dollars.) Like Frank hes a striver. He wants more. Frank starts out as the assistant for a Harlem drug boss and succeeds him to become bigger than even the mafia. And Richie after working all day as a detective goes to night school to become a lawyer. If theres anything ""American"" about ""American Gangster"" its that both protagonists believe in the American dream. ""American Gangster"" is based on the true story of Frank Lucas a disciplined criminal who brought a better grade of heroin to Harlem and left devastated lives in his wake. Scott takes us into the squalid apartments where naked women - naked so they cant steal - stand at a table bagging drugs while armed men stand guard in the next room. When Frank decides he needs to buy directly from the wholesaler the movie takes a side trip to Indochina and somehow Scott is able to make the jungle itself seem evil full of mist and secrets and unknowable pain. Just as a viewer you want to leave there as soon as you arrive. Richies world as a police detective is no prettier. He inhabits the bluish-tinged tenements and rundown police stations of Serpicos New York back in the days when the battle between good and evil was being won by evil and good wasnt even fielding an army. Richie gets dirty looks and threatening blank stares from his colleagues who perceive an honest cop as a threat but Crowe presents Richie as oblivious to disdain. Youve seen Crowe in his oblivious mode and its appealing - as though he has too many concerns and distractions to worry about what anybody else thinks. As Lucas Washington doesnt do much smiling and when he does smile his eyes dont. The spectacle of Washington as a gangster is engrossing though its difficult if you think about it to reconcile Franks most appalling acts of violence with the moral sense that Washington conveys just by virtue of being himself. Washington pins his performance on Franks cold-blooded business ethic and he makes it work. But I cant but suspect that the real Frank probably enjoyed being a crook a lot more than the fictional Frank - and that at least some of his violent acts had an element of sheer cruelty mixed in with the pragmatism. Still ""American Gangster"" is an enjoyable double character study and the movies length ultimately becomes an advantage. When it seems to end it doesnt and the extended epilogue enriches the experience of what went before. -- Advisory This film contains full frontal nudity (female) strong language and graphic violence.

Crime drama based on the true story of a Harlem drug lord who corrupted the NYPD narcotics division. With Denzel Washington Russell Crowe. Director Ridley Scott. (240) R Violence language drug use nudity. Area theaters.The last 40 minutes of Ridley Scotts ""American Gangster"" are as brilliantly directed acted and action-packed as anything since well last years Oscar-winning mob movie ""The Departed"" - or ""The French Connection"" ""Superfly"" and the ""Godfather"" movies that inspired it. But the film is 2 hours and 40 minutes long and the runup setup or whatever-up you want to call the first two hours is largely a drag relieved only by the riveting presence of Denzel Washington as real-life Harlem godfather Frank Lucas. This is Washingtons movie as much as it is Lucas story and he is as entertainingly evil here as in his Oscar-winning performance as a bad cop in ""Training Day."" The problem is that the movie - adapted from a magazine article about Lucas reign in the 60s and 70s when he cornered the local drug trade and bought off most of the NYPD narcotics cops assigned to bust him - spends as much time on the boring detective chasing Lucas as on the drug lord himself. Screenwriter Steven Zaillian was obviously compelled to flesh out the role of standup Newark detective Richie Roberts to give equal screen time to co-star Russell Crowe. You can appreciate the writers dilemma but every time the story shifts from Lucas to Roberts whos in the midst of an irrelevant custody battle with his ex-wife (Carla Gugino) it brings the movie to a halt. However once things move into the final stretch the film picks up speed fast. All of the characters introduced before - Josh Brolins openly corrupt special investigations cop Armand Assantes condescending Mafia boss Cuba Gooding Jr.s hotheaded drug dealer - come together in an extended version of the kind of layered violence that Francis Coppola made famous with his ""Godfather"" movies. Washington and Crowe dont appear together until late in the sizzling third act - and the two pros have an easy chemistry between them. Still there is not much to their characters. Scott is a gifted visual designer of content but he has rarely brought full human dimension to his characters and he doesnt do it here. Ultimately ""Gangster"" glorifies a murderer and parasite who bought his freedom by ratting out the corrupt cops in his pocket. In a devastating last-act speech the tiny and still lovely 83-year-old Ruby Dee playing Lucas mother gives the movie its one resounding note of moral outrage. The film needed more of her and it. jmathewsnydailynews.com Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

American Gangster 1 / 2 Back to Gallery A truism Any film that stars both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe isnt a bore. No matter what it is no matter how its made if it features these two bruisers in prominent roles then it is incontrovertibly watchable. Virtuosity taught me that back in 1995. Did you catch that one? With Washington as the noble cop chasing Crowe as the spiffy computerized serial-killer? The movie stank but it wasnt their fault. Even in production-line genre slop theyre a pair of omnivorous wolves. American Gangster is need I add a much better film than Virtuosity. Its a much better film than nine-tenths of whats out there on any given Friday and if youre a fan of steak-and-potatoes crime drama I highly recommend it. But it is derivative. It does end suddenly -- if a film can be said to end suddenly after 157 minutes -- at the very moment when both characters are on the verge of life-altering personality and career changes. I left the movie theater wanting to see the rest of it. Directed by Ridley Scott from a script by masculine-histrionics specialist Steven Zaillian (All the Kings Men) American Gangster began life as a New York Magazine profile of Frank Lucas -- the legendary smuggler and heroin kingpin who lorded over his own Harlem underworld from the late 1960s to the early 70s. Crowe gets to be the cop this time with Washington as his sleek criminal opposition but you know these two Every role they touch turns instantly complicated whether by good or by evil. Neither one can play a bad guy without seeming decent or a hero without trailing slime. Crowes cop therefore is a sweaty womanizer with a massive gut. Washingtons criminal is a suave and devoted family man who takes his mother (Ruby Dee) to church on Sunday. The cop is aware of his own flaws; the criminal is not convinced that hes a mere entrepreneur working hard to run a sound corporation. ""The most important thing in business is honesty -- honesty integrity hard work"" he imparts to acolytes at a diner. Then he gets up from his seat heads out to confront a rival and takes care of business mercilessly before heading back and tucking into breakfast. Its a killer scene -- thanks to Washingtons unflappable murderous poise and thanks to Scotts fleet but pragmatic 1970s pacing. Movie goers who long for the days of Serpico will be gladdened by the many reminders here including skuzzy cops on the take (Josh Brolin a riot of pomade) and cut portions of French Connection powder. Almost inevitably The Godfather also gets referenced We just cant escape without a montage juxtaposing religion with a gangland climax. Even the sky looks vintage -- overcast to mirror the gray-scale morality below. Rainy days follow snowy days follow cloudy days as cinematographer Harris Savides punctuates his grotty outdoor camerawork with low-light indoor scenes set in nondescript rooms. In one such putty-colored cell Crowe and Washington have their first real face-off some two-and-a-quarter hours after the movies start. It isnt all it should be -- remember the disappointment of that Pacino-De Niro match-up in Heat? -- and the film screeches to a halt shortly thereafter leaving unexplored an emergent friendship between two transformed men. Otherwise this third Scott-Crowe collaboration (after the period bloodletting of Gladiator and the in-vino-cutesiness of A Good Year) offers a good old-fashioned slab of actorly swagger. Make that two slabs bloody rare. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Wide-Ruled 70-Sheet Spiral-Bound Notebook for 17 cents +... Mens Leather Bifold Wallet with Money Clip for 3 + free...

When it hit Harlems avenues of fractured dreams cut with mannite and quinine it was the most potent heroin around. In the shooting galleries Blue Magic stood above competition with names like Rush Ding Dong KKK. The direct route the cargo followed from Southeast Asia to New York City in the late 60s and early 70s made a legend of Frank Lucas the drug lord in director Ridley Scotts ""American Gangster"" starring Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. For talent Scott couldnt start much purer. Washington and Crowe are consummate craftsmen who burrow deep into their characters. Contrary to their leading-man status neither has won our admiration - or awards - by overpowering a screenplay. (Crowes offscreen squandering of our fondness is another matter). Turns out you can dilute even this potent combination. All it takes is an ambitious but confused screenplay that switches back and forth between Washingtons gangster and Crowes cop slowly bringing prey into hunters scope. Blame it on David Chase that its become harder to make a resonant mob movie. The creator of ""The Sopranos"" didnt just understand the neuroses of the gangster. He consistently grasped our gangster love and walloped us on our heads for it. ""American Gangster"" rich with 70s atmospherics (hampered by a score more ""Baretta"" than ""Superfly"") owes us similar complexity but never strikes as tense a chord. Working in the confines of Steven Zaillians script (informed by Mark Jacobsons New York magazine profile) each actor gives glimmers of fine work but neither hits an alchemical tipping point. A North Carolina sharecroppers son Lucas migrated to New York in the late 40s. There he found a job as muscle confidant and heir (though it wasnt apparent to others in the organization) to Harlem gangster Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson. The way Lucas circumvented the Italian mob and juked squad rooms full of corrupt cops was audacious. It was also desecration. Kilos came stashed in the flag-draped caskets of soldiers slain in Vietnam. The movie wastes no time wasting somebody and establishing Washington in bad-dude mode. A similarly brutal force won him an Oscar for ""Training Day."" Dont expect a repeat. Richie Roberts (Crowe) is a New Jersey narc who is obstinately honest on the job and stubbornly lousy in every other aspect of his life. Just how clean is laid out early on when Richie and partner Javier (John Ortiz) come across a trunkful of ill-gotten gains and dont skim a cent. ""Cops kill cops they dont trust"" Javier bleats. The implication Cops dont honor cops who arent thieves. Josh Brolin proves Javiers point as New York detective Trupo who makes shakedown rounds in a hot black-and-gold muscle car his crooked colleagues in tow. Richies upstanding ways make outcasts of them both. Eventually Richie heads a clandestine drug task force separate from the police. Lucas also lives by an ethic. Just before Bumpy dies - fluttering eyes followed by a massive coronary - he pontificates in a Harlem appliance store on the means of production and monopolies. ""American Gangster"" offers a twisted story of enterprise supply and demand and rough business practices. In a time of pimp couture and the Superfly extravagance of Harlem rival Nicky Barnes (Cuba Gooding Jr.) Frank dressed quietly for success. ""The loudest man in the room is the weakest man in the room"" he tells brother Huey (Chiwetel Ejiofor ). Richies personal life falls apart. Frank consolidates his empire. Richie loses a wife. His ex (Carla Gugino in a brittle sharp turn) wants to take their son and move. Frank takes a wife - Eva (Lymari Nadal). Richie is bereft of family ties. Frank buys his mama (Ruby Dee) a plantation estate and brings his brothers into the fold. Up north his sibs are known as the Country Boys. Its a classical set-up of opposites. So why isnt it the hoped-for masterpiece? In BETs cable special on Lucas the real-life Richie Roberts recounts the turning point in the case. A mother takes the stand in a courtroom. Shed found her son on the toilet dead needle still in his arm a packet of Blue Magic nearby. ""You could hear a pin drop as she was testifying"" says Roberts. ""Some people were crying."" ""American Gangster"" provides no comparable moment of truth or emotional power. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

Comments click to enlarge American Gangster Rated R  2007 Ridley Scott serves up Brian De Palmas Scarface cocktail--historical sweep for the middlebrow bloody vengeance for the lowbrow--in this crime epic (2007) about the rise and fall of Harlem heroin kingpin Frank Lucas. Set in the Vietnam era it cuts relentlessly back and forth between Lucas (Denzel Washington) as he builds his empire and federal investigator Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) as he zeroes in on the dealer hindered at every turn by the wholesale corruption of the NYC police force. With one of these two alpha males anchoring nearly every scene Scott really cant go wrong but the lead characters are pretty thin a fact highlighted by generic subplots Lucas wants to impress his poor southern mama Roberts needs to spend more time with his kid.

Russell Crowe is mumbling eloquence as Richie Roberts the dogged cop who brought down the real-life Harlem godfather.While Ridley Scotts film delivers pulse-pounding tension is not in its glassine envelope.At its best American Gangster is an absorbing character study distinguished by textured performances and gritty cinematography in the run-and-gun 70s style of The French Connection.But it lacks momentum and thus the propulsion required to rocket it into the movie mythosphere. Its choppy editing hurts. An orchestral musical score rather than its jukebox soundtrack might have helped unify its ping-pong narrative. This is not a mob opera its a pop procedural.Inspired by ""The Return of Superfly"" Mark Jacobsons incredible-but-true magazine profile of the 70s Harlem kingpin Gangster opposes two types Lucas outlaw and devoted family man versus Roberts lawman and unfaithful husband.Put them in the same room - which doesnt happen until the films climax - and they are brothers under the holster. Half moral half immoral all monomaniac.Scotts film opens with a chilling glimpse of the stone-faced Lucas incinerating a rival thug then pumping him with bullets - the hit-man equivalent of wearing both belt and suspenders.American Gangster details how Lucas went from henchman to overlord of the Harlem underworld less good at showing what drove him. The real-life Lucas boasted to Jacobson that he had the business brain for Wall Street but couldnt have gotten hired as a janitor there.Like self-made men before and since Lucas applied his entrepreneurial skills to the supply-and-demand of the street. He buys heroin direct from the poppy fields of Asia controls the means of transport packaging and distribution. He cut out the middleman boosted his profits and - in the most daring part of the scheme - smuggled in the contraband on U.S. military jets.As Lucas Washington streams like a torpedo splintering the hull of society. When he says ""My man"" its an expletive. Both he and Ruby Dee as his mother give Oscar-caliber performances.Like most mob films Gangster is a study in extreme capitalism its collateral benefits and damage. In a Thanksgiving montage it shows that while Lucas drug empire affords him the Norman Rockwell American dream it comes at the cost of hungry kids crying as their parents overdose.What Lucas does is illegal and immoral. But hes not pretending to serve the public like Det. Trupo (Josh Brolin effective in a Simon Legree mustache) the on-the-take cop who in the screenplays moral relativism is a bigger villain than Lucas.In the labored symmetry of Steven Zaillians screenplay Lucas rise and fall is balanced by Roberts fall and rise. This may respect the biographical facts but feels overdetermined. If Lucas makes a million on the street bet that Roberts is going to find a million - of Trupos shakedown money - and will return it like the Boy Scout he is. If Lucas clenches his fists to flex his power bet that Roberts will have jitterfingers to signify how nervous he is.This symmetry does have a payoff when at last Lucas and Roberts face off. Great actors like great athletes elevate each others games. Its thrilling to watch these guys frequent Oscar competitors go at each other. Can Washingtons steel withstand Crowes corrosiveness? Is the fist mightier than the jitterfingers? Does the Hurricane blow away Cinderella Man? Its a draw.Though by the end the two actors are evenly matched this is Washingtons film. With its quicksilver mood shifts Washingtons performance makes him an Oscar front-runner. (Crowes likely citation will be for 310 to Yuma.) I know that if Washington wins Ill be annoyed all over again that his lead-actor statuettes are for his unrepentant figures in Training Day and Gangster rather than the redemptive figures of Malcolm X and Hurricane.American Gangster  (out of four stars) Directed by Ridley Scott.

Thats a reflection of the drug trades lethal paradox the better the product the worse the devastation. A different paradox conditions our response to the film which was directed by Ridley Scott from a script by Steven Zaillian and co-stars Russell Crowe as an unstoppable cop on Lucass case. The better it gets -- and the drama grows in power over its quasi-epic course of 157 minutes -- the more it brings to mind the truly great gangster films of American movie history starting with ""The Godfather"" and extending back to such landmarks as ""The Public Enemy"" and ""Scarface."" Yet these recollections are part of the enjoyment. They lend stature by association to the impressive product on the screen. ENLARGE ""American Gangster"" is based on a true story (a ""true juggernaut success story"" according to the publicity). Frank Lucas who is still with us was in fact a rags-to-riches businessman who took over what had been a mafia monopoly and Richie Roberts the laconic womanizer played by Russell Crowe was the detective and later prosecutor who brought the kingpin down. Truth inevitably turns fictional when a character as murderous as Lucas is portrayed by the buoyant and dashing Denzel Washington but not as fictional or romanticized as you might think. In the grand tradition of gangster sociopaths this extravagant black godfather -- Franks chinchilla coat helps lead to his undoing -- can go from effortless seducer to stone killer in one beat of whatever serves as his heart. Lucas dominates the action though thats not to suggest that Mr. Crowe is overmatched. (This formidable actor has never been overmatched except by a few bad scripts.) He plays Richie as a perpetual high-school kid who happens to be fiercely intelligent. Its a big performance and a beautifully modulated one -- I thought of Wallace Beery -- that makes the role seem more substantial than it is. During long stretches of the narrative Richies main function is to make shrewd assumptions about Lucass M.O. which involves smuggling vast quantities of heroin into the United States inside caskets containing the remains of soldiers killed in Vietnam. (One of those assumptions leads to a thrilling sequence at a stateside air base.) From the very first scene an attention-grabber that does its work shockingly well Mr. Scott and his colleagues -- most notably the cinematographer Harris Savides and the production designer Arthur Max -- provide a densely populated lavishly detailed view of the period. The direction is impeccable whether in the sweeping action of the set pieces or in the department of small talk and murmurs. (The supporting cast includes Chiwetel Ejiofor Cuba Gooding Jr. Josh Brolin Ted Levine Armand Assante and an affecting if overwrought Ruby Dee.) Mr. Zaillians script has more on its mind than cat-and-mouse -- or mongoose-and-cobra -- games. Both Frank and Richie are by their own lights men of honor bound by their own codes; the irony of those parallels is obvious but still interesting. Both go to great lengths to assemble trustworthy teams. And in a reach for more meaning the film draws a parallel between Franks downfall and the fall of Saigon. (Thats not such a reach in a literal sense since his supply channel depends on the Vietnam War.) In the end though the success of ""American Gangster"" doesnt flow from the originality of its ideas or its bid for epic status as much as from its craftsmanship and confident professionalism. Its a great big gangster film and a good one. Bee Movie ""Bee Movie"" isnt a B movie its a Z movie as in dizmal. This animated feature might have been tolerable though for what demographic Im not sure if its hyper vocal star Jerry Seinfeld had chosen to drone. Instead he delivers every line -- every stupid bee joke that he and his cronies could cook up -- with a pounding punishing triumphalism that recalls not the Seinfeld of ""Seinfeld"" but Milton Berle on a really bad night. ENLARGE Jerry Seinfeld provides the voice for Barry B. Benson in ""Bee Movie."" As you may have gleaned from a publicity campaign thats been slightly less invasive than the influenza pandemic of 1918 Mr. Seinfelds character a bee named Barry B. Benson has just graduated from college and cant face a life of making honey. (The storys borrowings from ""The Graduate"" include a swimming pool.) Escaping the hive he goes out into the world as a pollen jock -- a member of an airborne squadron that sprinkles a DreamWorks version of Disney-dust on Central Park -- and falls in love with Vanessa Bloome a florist voiced by Renee Zellweger. And why not since Barry can talk -- his problem and ours is that he cant stop talking -- and her boyfriend Ken is monstrously dislikable. (Vanessa is no bargain either at least for a while.) Why not indeed. Whats the harm if one of the most successful comics in show biz history business gets to buzz around in a would-be comic fable about the bees and the bees? The graphics are pretty enough -- a vision of the hive thats somewhere between Richard Scarry and Rube Goldberg. And the script is not after all content-free. Once Barry discovers that people eat honey he sues the human race for exploiting his species treasure. Its just that the movie aims so low and still manages to miss all distinction. At one point in Barrys honey trial an exasperated defense lawyer asks ""How do we know this talking bee isnt some kind of Hollywood wizardry?"" Would that wizards had left their mark. This is Hollywood hackery.    DVD TIP Theres no more eloquent visualization of childhoods mystery than Victor Erices ""The Spirit of the Beehive"" (1973) one of the most important films ever made in Spain. In the key scene a Castilian village child named Ana (played by 6-year-old Ana Torrent) watches James Whales ""Frankenstein"" at a traveling cinema then takes the film as a touchstone with which to interpret subsequent events in her life. Luis Cuadrados cinematography is as it was meant to be beautiful beyond words.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor November 2 2007 Save for later Saved The self-importance of Ridley Scotts ""American Gangster"" announces itself with its title. This is not intended to be just any old crime thriller. Its going to be archetypal.The fact that its ""based on a true story"" lends credence to the notion that what we are seeing is more ""real"" than the usual trumped-up gangster scenarios. But despite its heavy-duty packaging ""American Gangster"" is in many respects just as hokey and melodramatic as its less authenticated forebears. Its an entertaining pulp pastiche with pretensions.Denzel Washington is Frank Lucas who served as driver and bag man for Harlems famed hood Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III). Bumpys death in 1968 propels Frank into the big leagues. Aided by a relative stationed in Vietnam he secretly imports pure heroin from Thailand on US military planes and becomes very rich. He brings over his four brothers from North Carolina to help in the operation. He installs his hardscrabble mother (Ruby Dee) in a rural mansion. He marries Miss Puerto Rico (Lymari Nadal). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Intercut with Franks odyssey is the more familiar saga of the fed who tracks him down. Richie Roberts played by Russell Crowe is a working-class New Jersey guy who takes law courses at night and has a marriage on the rocks. Hes also 100 percent honest which doesnt endear him to his fellow cops. When a bust uncovers a million dollars in the trunk of a car Richie helpfully returns it all. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Frank and Richie will have their showdown but director Scott and screenwriter Steven Zaillian postpone the inevitable until almost the end of this overlong 157-minute movie. Meantime we are ping-ponged back and forth between the two mens lives and the parallels are workmanlike. Frank and Richie are presented as tough guys working opposite ends of the system. Frank who thinks nothing of addicting half of Harlem is blithely amoral; Richie is doggedly incorruptible.""American Gangster"" is often best around the edges. Without making a big deal about it Scott reveals how the Mafia while putting up a businesslike front deplored the incursion of black gangsters into the drug trade. It shows how Frank controlled his turf as much through fear as through power. (In one sequence just to show he can get away with it he shoots a loudmouth rival point blank on a crowded street.)Washington does a good job with a difficult role. Frank does not dress flashily or live big because he believes that doing so would make him a target and so he has the aura of a man too embittered to enjoy his own spoils. Washingtons performance may be too tamped down to be truly exciting but emotionally it rings true.Crowe is highly proficient but he doesnt provide enough psychological shadings. However he has the requisite masculine force for the role and that counts for something in a movie where everybody is trying to outswagger everyone else.The two sharpest performances in ""American Gangster"" belong not to the two leads but to Ruby Dee as Franks mother who has a truly savage moment near the end when she confronts her gangster son and Josh Brolin as the most crooked of cops.Scott doesnt play up the degradation Franks heroin wreaks in his community as if to do so would be unnecessary or worse uncool. But by holding back the horrors he succeeds in making Frank something of a folk hero. Crime may not always pay in the movies but it usually glitters. ""American Gangster"" tries to set itself up as a nightmare rags-to-riches saga - a kind of African-American sidebar to ""The Godfather"" - but it too easily coasts on the thrill of the chase instead of focusing on why the chase was necessary.

"American Gangster A Direct Hit washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies American Gangster A Direct Hit Network News X Profile View More Activity Play Video TRAILER | American Gangster TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 2 2007 In ""American Gangster"" time doesnt fly it explodes. The thing is 2 1/2 hours long; it feels like 40 minutes. Whether its the next great American crime movie or simply this years professional stunner will be determined over the next few months. For now its enough to say that the story of the rise and fall of an African American drug kingpin is relentlessly told by the English director Ridley Scott (""Gladiator"" ""Black Hawk Down""); it just keeps on coming. Starring Denzel Washington as Frank Lucas a beneath-the-radar Harlem heroin impresario who puts together an astonishing organization before anyone notices and Russell Crowe as Richie Roberts the Jersey detective who tracks him the movie has the aspirations of a crime-and-punishment epic a superb feel for time and milieu and an almost subliminal feel for myth. ""Is this the end of Rico?"" ""I aint so tough."" ""Ill make him an offer he cant refuse."" These iconic lines are from the tradition in which ""American Gangster"" hopes to find its way. ""Either youre somebody or you aint nobody"" seems to be the line it dreams will live forever. The movie begins by evoking the classic old gangster Bumpy Johnson (dead-eyed Clarence Williams III) the numbers king of Harlem who outlived Dutch Schultz and Lucky Luciano and by the mid-60s was the criminal Yoda of the rough terrain above 125th Street a bitter old cynic who complained to his driver about the profligacy and the lack of dignity and self-discipline of todays generation of criminals. His driver just up from North Carolina was Frank Lucas and he listened hard and well. When his turn came he insisted that his organizations minions be low-key steely-eyed well-dressed un-flamboyant. They may have carried .45s but they dressed Brooks Brothers. Frank himself could shoot a competitor in the head then cross the street and eat breakfast confident that his sedate coat and tie would shield him from the attention of police investigators who hassled guys with bling around their necks. Frank had a gimmick. He had a cousin a well-connected career NCO in Southeast Asia (the war haunts the movie it should be noted) and via that connection was able to smuggle in pure Chinese-grown smack (Ric Young does a memorable job in brief scenes as an oleaginous Kuomintang generalissimo in the highlands of Thailand). His junk is better and cheaper than anything on the streets and soon enough by the physics of the market he controls the streets. The Mafia (repped by Armand Assante dressed in the fashion of Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) has to come to him  And who opposes him? Hardly the New York Police Department portrayed as so totally corrupt that the cops are only too eager to keep the drugs flowing as a way to subsidize summer homes in Florida which dovetails neatly with other period films like ""Serpico"" and ""Prince of the City."" Only one man rises to the challenge. That is Crowes Richie complete with Popeye Doyles scrubby wardrobe and a Jersey accent that sounds like it came from Hoboken out of Perth Amboy. Richie is famously honest and in Newark he marks himself off from all cops for all time by the simple act of turning in a million bucks he recovered from the back of a mob Cadillac. Big mistake Richie No cop in the Newark of the early 60s would work with a guy they knew was tainted by the disease of honesty. So when Richie calls for backup guess who shows up nobody. Like Serpico he goes through the doors alone. After years of isolation Richie finally gets a chance to jump to the Feds -- in an early iteration of the Drug Enforcement Administration -- and heads a task force to take down the Harlem heroin lord. But first he has to get a serious enemy out of the way the New York City Police Department. Scott working from a brilliant script by Steven Zaillian (""Schindlers List"" among his many other A-list projects) plays the two stories off each other so adroitly that we dont notice that the two antagonists though defined by the parallel cutting and equal screen time as well as the charisma of the stars arent even aware of each other until the movies second half and never eyeball each other until the last 20 minutes. And yet thats not bad thats good thats even the heart of the movies brilliance. Scott gets so much right that its easy to ignore the singular brilliance of the movie which is that it gets its star management right. By that I mean Scott and Zaillian are aware of (and dependent upon) the charisma of the stars as they build toward their fated collision. Yet theyre also aware that like so many a gangster movie before were secretly in awe of the nominal ""bad guy"" and that in any case the rules of movie stardom far outweigh the rules of social morality at least in the sepulcher of the theater. Thus while we disapprove of Frank we dont want to see him destroyed; we want to see him bond with Richie in a way that salvages his soul destroys a true enemy and send us out on a high note. We want within the world of chaos greed and ambition that marks the gangster genre a happy ending. This is what Scott and Zaillian and Washington and Crowe give us. Washington is brilliant. He makes sense of a man who could move his mother into a mansion and love the joy on her face and yet coldly place a Browning 9mm against a competitors forehead and reply to the question ""What are you going to do Frank shoot me in front of all these people?"" by shooting him in front of all those people. Washington seems to have a secret mechanism by which he turns his face off; it goes from a vibrant expressive projection of humanity and empathy to a stone-killer executioners mask so fast its scary. He makes you fear Frank. Yet he also makes you love Frank. Thats the key to the thing the charisma of the man who triumphs over the system. And so identified with this theme is ""American Gangster"" that its other hero Richie is also defined as an outsider. The movie seems to be saying When the inside is so corrupt you must turn to outsiders. Does it over-glamorize a man who after all sold people drugs for money and their souls and lived high while they bottomed out in the gutter and were found in the thousands with needle tracks scabs and hepatitis B in cold Harlem alleyways? In a word yes. But that is not its decision alone its also ours -- as a society as a culture as a civilization were complicit in the promotion of deviance to heroism. That figure -- the dope dealer the seller of the Sportin Life with his powders and his escapes -- has moved from pariah to rock star over the years. Wishing it werent so isnt going to make it go away. American Gangster (157 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violence pervasive drug content profanity nudity and sexuality.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 1 2007 244 PM American Gangster A star-studded epic that doesnt bring the heat. By Dana Stevens Denzel Washington plays Frank Lucas in American Gangster American Gangster (Universal) Ridley Scotts epic about Harlem crime boss Frank Lucas never reconciles its desire to be the black Scarface-- a bloody balls-out fantasy of crime as a form of ethnic empowerment--with its aspiration to be something weightier a grittily realistic treatise on race capitalism and social mobility in America. As a result the movie is never quite pop enough to get audiences hooting and hollering and quoting favorite lines nor smart enough to inspire passionate post-movie debate. Scene by scene the film is unassailably well-crafted. (Whether there had to be so many scenes--the subplot-stuffed saga runs 157 minutes--is another matter.) But theres something oddly dull even respectable about Scotts adherence to the rules of gangster-film grammar. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Its almost incredible that anything about this movie could be staid when you consider its source material a 2000 New York Magazine profile of Frank Lucas by Mark Jacobson in which the 69-year-old kingpin parked on the street corners of the neighborhood he once owned spins eye-popping impossible-to-verify tales of smuggling dope out of Southeast Asia on Henry Kissingers plane. Lucas is a satanic charmer who can turn a phrase like nobodys business The atmosphere at a high-stakes pool game was ""so quiet you couldve heard a rat piss on a piece of cotton in China."" Advertisement When we first meet Ridley Scotts Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) in 1969 hes a discreet driver and occasional hired gun for the old-school Harlem gangster Ellsworth ""Bumpy"" Johnson (Clarence Williams III). Bumpy dies of old age in Franks arms mumbling about his disdain for the newfangled chain stores that are taking over the neighborhood ""What right do they have cutting out the suppliers ... buying direct from the manufacturer?"" As the soft-spoken but merciless Frank takes over Bumpys operation thats exactly what he proceeds to do eliminating the Mafia middleman and smuggling his dope direct from Vietnam in the coffins of dead soldiers. Franks unusual business methods allow him to charge half the price for a product twice as good a dangerously pure heroin that goes by the street name Blue Magic. As a result Frank has soon cornered the junkie market infuriating both his Italian competitors and the crooked cops who depend on them for kickbacks. This brings Frank to the attention of Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) a New Jersey cop whos so clean that when he came upon a stash of 1 million he turned it in--an act thats earned him the contempt of the entire department. Roberts is named head of a federal drug task force to investigate the source of Blue Magic and although Frank soon emerges as a player the evidence against him remains maddeningly slippery. So unfortunately does the character of Frank Lucas who should be the dark pulsing heart of this movie. Instead Washingtons gangster is as opaque and iconic as the face on a coin. Its hard to know whether to attribute this indistinct quality to the script (by Steven Zaillian) to Washingtons tight-lipped performance or to something that exceeds both a factor well call ""Denzelitude."" As I heard one viewer say on the way out of the screening ""I had my problems with the movie but you just cant hate on Denzel."" Precisely. Despite Washingtons Oscar-winning excursion into villainy in Training Day hes still somehow too measured too refined and statesmanlike to bring the gonzo crazy when needed. I found his performance in Training Day a bit hammy but in American Gangster Washington goes the other direction; he plays a drug kingpin so austere and restrained that we never understand Franks true motivation. Is he simply a born businessman who might in another time and place have made his millions in mergers and acquisitions? Or does he need to be a criminal--does he enjoy gunning down rivals in broad daylight and slamming peoples heads into grand pianos? Russell Crowe as the cop-turned-prosecutor whos more honest than he is good (Richies personal life as we learn in an intrusive subplot is in the toilet) delivers a more finely detailed performance but that may be because the movie doesnt ask him to bear as much symbolic weight as Washingtons title character. The title itself suggests that theres something quintessential about the Frank Lucas story and at key moments hes given to pronouncements like ""I can do anything I want--this is America"" But when it comes to unpacking that symbolic baggage the movie is vague falling back on pre-existing mob-film archetypes (the climactic scene in which Scott crosscuts between a raid on Lucas house and a formal church celebration is straight from The Godfather). In a rushed and unsatisfying coda Richie and Frank join forces to prosecute the bad cops (led by a marvelously slimy Josh Brolin). The movies central ambiguity is revealed in this ending. What should have been a clash of two opposing moral universes instead comes off as a wan buddy flick. What exactly is the story of Franks rise and fall supposed to have shown us about gangsters or about America? And if the answer is ""nothing"" shouldnt we have had more fun?

Denzel Washington dazzles in his best screen performance to date as Frank Lucas a real-life Harlem drug lord who revolutionized his nasty business by importing heroin directly from Thailand and selling a product that cost half as much and was twice as potent as anything on the market. In the detail-packed script by Steven Zaillian (an Oscar winner for ""Schindlers List"") just about the only cop standing in Lucas way is the resolutely honest Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) a former Essex County detective recruited by the feds to run an undercover operation against both drug dealers and massively corrupt narcs. Crowe is solid in a self-effacing way as this Serpico-like character but the film belongs to the mesmerizing Washington as Lucas who seized power after his mentor legendary Harlem crime lord Bumpy Johnson (Clarence Williams III) died of a heart attack in 1968. Lucas had little education but the street-smart instincts of a CEO. Knowing that drug use is rampant among troops during the then-raging Vietnam War he sees it as a business opportunity. Rather than continuing to buy heavily cut heroin from the Mafia Lucas flies to the Far East and makes a deal to cut out the middle man - using military planes to transport the smack sometimes in the coffins of U.S. servicemen. Soon Lucas is grossing 1 million a day and has sent for his brothers (Chiwetel Ejiofor plays the oldest) and cousins from North Carolina installing them in low-profile businesses that serve as fronts for drug distribution points in New York and New Jersey. He also brings up his mother (the great Ruby Dee) and buys her a large house where they all have dinner every Sunday the model of middle-class strivers. Unlike his better-known and flamboyant rival Nicky Barnes (briefly impersonated by Cuba Gooding Jr. in ""Superfly"" mode) Lucas mostly is scrupulous not to draw attention to himself or his activities - even when he carries out a public execution on the street just to remind everyone whos boss. The major exception occurs when his wife (Lymari Nadal) a former Miss Puerto Rico buys Lucas a chinchilla coat as a birthday present and he unwisely wears it to a Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fight at Madison Square Garden. Worse he sits in front of a Mafia don (Armand Assante) who by this point is buying drugs from Lucas. This draws the attention of the cop Roberts his polar opposite who lacks Lucas gift for gab and indeed has a talent for alienating people. While Lucas lives comfortably Roberts is a financially struggling divorced dad who to the disdain of his colleagues turns in nearly a million dollars worth of cash probably skimmed by cops from the French Connection bust. Eschewing his recent reliance on computer-generated effects ""Gladiator"" director Scott realizes this compelling saga doesnt need his usual stylistic tricks. Scott builds considerable tension cutting back and forth between these two stories until Lucas and Roberts finally meet more than two hours into the 157 minutes for a twist climax I found especially rewarding. I also give Scott credit for not shying away from graphically depicting the horror of heroin addiction caused by Lucas and the law-enforcers he had on the payroll (Josh Brolin plays a particularly nasty specimen of the latter). Its probably the most unflinching picture of drug use since Brian DePalmas ""Scarface"" though Scott thankfully avoids that films operatic excesses and over-the-top performances. ""American Gangster"" feels a little rushed as Scott ties up loose ends in the last half hour. It left me wanting more. Thats one of the biggest compliments I can pay one of the years best movies - and surely a major Oscar contender.

"American Gangster | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; american-gangster ) American Gangster (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli American Gangster is compelling in the same way that many mob-related motion pictures are compelling but it fails to achieve the greatness that the best of them attain. The problem with American Gangster may be that it tries to hard to provide balance between the protagonist and the antagonist but never really achieves it. While the story is rarely dull and theres plenty of material to fill up the more than 2 1/2 hour running time theres an overall absence of dramatic tension. Ridley Scott rarely creates an uninteresting motion picture and this is no exception but American Gangster will not go down as one of the respected directors best efforts. The cast is headlined by two Oscar winners Denzel Washington as Harlem drug lord Frank Lucas and Russell Crowe as North Jersey drug cop Richie Roberts. The time period is the early 1970s with drug use escalating on the streets of New York even as the interminable war in Vietnam drags on. The framework of American Gangster bears the ""based on a true story"" moniker and Lucas (now in his 70s) was one of the films advisors but numerous liberties have been taken with the historical record. Some of these are effective but others create head-scratching contrivances that are hard to swallow even for someone who easily suspends disbelief. (Example Would an arresting officer be allowed to try the arrested individual as his first case after passing the bar especially when its a major drug case?) For many years Frank has been the driver for mobster Bumpy Johnson. When a heart attack fells Bumpy Frank uses his contacts and knowledge to carve out a niche in the Harlem drug market. But his circumstances are fragile with other black mobsters and the Mafia threatening to squeeze him out. To make his position unassailable Frank executes a bold move - he travels to Bangkok to set up a direct deal with the drug producers cutting out the middle men. In order to transport the drugs into the United States he uses the army which is constantly ferrying men and equipment to Vietnam. Suddenly Frank has the purest heroin on the streets of New York and he can sell it cheaper than any of his competitors. It doesnt take long before Mafioso Dominic Cattano (Armand Assante) is working for him. Meanwhile in New Jersey Richie has become a pariah for turning in 1 million in unmarked drug money which was designated for cop payoffs. He is transferred to a newly formed narcotics squad and gets to pick his own men. Their goal - take down the highest placed drug lord they can get evidence against and their sights are eventually trained on Frank. But Richie has problems both professional and personal. His ex-wife (Carla Gugino) is suing him for custody of his son he is not well respected by his peers and his New York City equivalent Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin) is on the take. Franks portion of the story is energetic and intense. We are treated to a lot of little details about the drug trade that recall the behind-the-scenes look at gambling offered by Martin Scorsese in Casino. (For example all the women cutting and packaging the drugs in Franks ""workshop"" do so in the nude so they cant steal any to take home.) Frank is a fascinating and charismatic character in the best tradition of screen mobsters. For the most part he is gentlemanly and courteous. He loves his wife (Lymari Nadal) and his mother (Ruby Dee). But there are times when he snaps and his dark side shows - as in a scene when he brutally eliminates a rival in broad daylight in the middle of a crowd. Unfortunately Richie is rather dull and the segments featuring his story arent nearly as interesting. Its odd to find such a volatile and forceful actor as Russell Crowe stuck in a low-key performance. Theres nothing wrong with Crowes acting. Like Washington hes very good. The problem is the character and this aspect of the plot. Its inferior and the films level of energy declines palpably every time the scene switches from Frank to Richie. These two are set up as rivals but they never seem equally matched in their chess game. If theres an acting surprise its Josh Brolin who digs his teeth into the role of Trupo and tears at it with relish. All thats missing is the black hat. Frank is more of an anti-hero than a villain a self-made man who has pulled himself up by his bootstraps and spreads around the wealth. The movie allows us to sympathize with him while never forgetting what he is. (Theres a brilliant sequence that contrasts Franks cutting of the Thanksgiving turkey with users dying of overdoses on his drugs.) Trupo on the other hand is a true bad guy - a blackhearted opportunist with a gun who lords his power over everyone in an era when killing a cop was almost unheard of. Scotts intention is to build the story to its climax by contrasting Richie and Frank as he brings them into conflict with each other. It doesnt work as well as the director would like because the material is uneven and the conflict lacks potency. Theres never a sense that these two are in opposition at least not until the end. That dulls the films edge. And its hard to deny that American Gangster is a better motion picture when it is centered on Frank than on Richie. While the decision to focus on a black gangster isnt original the way in which Frank is developed is unique and thats the primary reason why the film works. Characters whose personalities mix so many contradictory and volatile elements are always the most interesting - thats what has made Michael Corleone one of the all-time best screen gangsters and theres more than a little of this in Frank. Like in Training Day and Malcolm X where he portrayed less than perfect individuals Washington rules the screen. His portrayal is one of many things that elevates this film to the level of being consistently entertaining and occasionally compelling.

Theres no doubt that Frank communicates strength -- in fact he communicates little else. Washington might be playing a senator or Malcolm X all over again; his performance is smooth confident and more than a little familiar. Even as a gangster he doesnt transform -- he doesnt release his inner thug. Hes still every inch Denzel all dour nobility. Directed by Ridley Scott and adapted by screenwriter Steven Zaillian from a New York magazine story entitled ""The Return of Superfly"" American Gangster is meticulous and detailed a drug-world epic that holds you from moment to moment immersing you in the intricate and sleazy logistics of crime. Yet the movie isnt quite enthralling; its more like the ghost version of a 70s classic. Scott nails the grit and clutter of the era -- the bombed-out buildings the litter and the rusty pay phones -- and he structures the film almost pointillistically with brief heightened coruscating scenes that flow into each other. American Gangster unfolds on parallel tracks cutting back and forth between Frank Lucas reign and the stubborn quest of Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) a terse and scruffy last-honest-narcotics-cop-in-New York to hunt him down. Its like The Godfather Serpico Scarface and The French Connection all mashed in a blender along with a heavy helping of synthetic cocktail mix. Lucas aspires to be a new kind of inner-city criminal. Hes a drug dealer who thinks like a CEO without the plumage of previous black gangsters. His innovation which puts him a step ahead of the Italian Mob is to realize that with the Vietnam War raging he can purchase uncut heroin directly from the Southeast Asian kingpins who supply it to American soldiers. Using his connections he journeys upriver like a grunt in Apocalypse Now to the jungles of Thailand and buys 100 kilos. He then cuts the U.S. military into the deal by having the drugs shipped back on Army planes. Now thats thinking outside the box. Franks product marketed as ""Blue Magic"" is purer than any other dealers and he sells it for less. American Gangster tells the story of a singular underworld mind yet Frank as a character isnt fascinating exactly. Hes an icon who hasnt been completely filled in. Every half hour or so starting with the opening scene he commits some hideous cold-blooded execution meant to demonstrate hes got more stones than anyone else. His fury though is tidy and compartmentalized. Even for a stealth corporate gangster he doesnt show a glimmer of it the rest of the time. You never feel -- like you did when James Cagney shoved that grapefruit in his girlfriends face in The Public Enemy or when Tony Montana unleashed his mad-dog machine-gun rage in Scarface -- that Frank is a gangster because he lives and breathes violence. Washingtons performance lacks idiosyncrasy and it also lacks a whisper of the streets though that at least is by design. When Franks Puerto Rican beauty-queen wife (Lymari Nadal) gives him a striped fur coat he wears it to the 1973 Ali-Frazier fight and thats the tip-off to Detective Roberts that theres a new player in town. Frank gets caught out the one night he dresses like a pimp. Theres an irony to that fact the film should have made more of. What works terrifically is Roberts fixation on Frank. Crowe plays him with a thick hunched body and a squint of a scowl. Hes a caveman lug who has burned his life down to an ashy nub of integrity. Catching criminals is all he has; hes every bit as obsessed with nailing dirty cops like the shakedown bully Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin). Still it takes a special doggedness to trap Lucas since Franks secret weapon -- the real way he sneaks drugs into the country not revealed until late in the film -- has a ghastly ingenuity. Frank builds his empire with family uprooting brothers cousins and his dear old mother (Ruby Dee) from North Carolina and moving them to a mansion that looks like the Tara of Westchester. Yet we barely get to know the brothers even as they run Franks operation. (The great Chiwetel Ejiofor is wasted.) American Gangster is never dull but it could have used more good old-fashioned melodramatic intrigue. The last section in which Lucas and Roberts finally connect is almost weirdly upbeat. Many movie gangsters have of course become role models but this film might have been more convincing if it didnt set out to create one.

By David Denby Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington in Ridley Scotts new movie.   Credit JOHN RITTER Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) the dazzling thug in ""American Gangster"" is a man particular in his ways and early in the movie he sees something that bothers him. For years Frank a real-life figure was a protege of the Harlem crime boss Ellsworth (Bumpy) Johnson and when Bumpy dies in 1968 the wake at his house draws in the notables--local politicians assorted mafiosi and Harlem ruffians one of whom an insolent dude named Tango puts a damp glass of Scotch down on Bumpys lacquered dining-room table. Frank picks it up dries off the table and places the glass on a coaster. For Frank there is a correct and an incorrect way of doing things and property like Bumpys acquired after long and arduous criminal activity should be revered. Tango lacks judgment and class--hes a noisy show-off--and some months later Frank having taken over Bumpys operation draws a gun on Tango and as dozens of people look on shoots him in the head. Frank is eliminating a rival and also teaching a lesson in etiquette. At roughly the same time Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe) a real-life Essex County New Jersey police detective and his excitable partner Javier (Javy) Rivera (John Ortiz) discover about a million dollars in unmarked bills in the trunk of a car. Javy reasons that the money has been lifted by a cop during a drug bust so if he and Richie turn it in they will in effect be turning a cop in. Javy is a junkie and a liar but his logic in this case is impeccable. (We later discover in an intertextual flourish that the money may be linked to the French Connection.) Ignoring Javy Richie counts out the bills in a station house as the upholders of the law eye him balefully. Like Frank Serpico another honest cop of the period Richie becomes a pariah and so obsessed with his job that no one can live with him. His wife takes their son and leaves. Russell Crowe is thick-shouldered and a little heavy in the gut; he gives Richie a quick stumpy walk and he leans forward when he sits as if he needed to be close to the ground in order to think. Denzel Washington stands upright wears perfectly tailored suits and smiles like the captain of a luxury liner entertaining royal guests. In style Richie and Frank are as different as a badger and a hawk but ""American Gangster"" which was produced by Brian Grazer written by Steven Zaillian and directed by Ridley Scott presents them as equals. They are both ambitious punctilious violent men. When they finally meet they regard each other as spiritual brothers. ""American Gangster"" which is based on Mark Jacobsons New York profile of Lucas from 2000 (with some parts fictionalized) is a febrile cops-and-robbers picture that has been scaled as an epic. Set in the years 1968 to 1975 it encompasses the rise of black entrepreneurial capitalism in its criminal version the corruption of law enforcement and the shadowy crossover between the two. In passing the filmmakers suggest that Americas heroin epidemic in those years grew out of the disintegration of Army morale during the Vietnam War when thousands of G.I.s got hooked. Scott fills the screen with scenes of Americans shooting up in Bangkok and Harlem getting rich on crime and having a terrific time. Its as if the country were transfixed by war drugs and violence with no one but the dour troubled Nixon as an authority figure. The references to film classics of the period acknowledge the way the crime wave and the resistance to it was mythologized even as it was happening. The movie is a descendant not just of ""The French Connection"" but of the raucous blaxploitation romps of the early seventies. Its ""Super Fly""--which also had a drug-dealer hero--without the cartoon cruddiness and the put-on violence and with an enormous increase of range and detail How is the drug business actually done? How do mules get the stuff from one place to another? The pace of the movie is rapid almost hectic the touch glancing. Until the confrontation between Frank and Richie at the end nothing stays on the screen for long although Scott working in the street or in clubs and at parties packs as much as he can into the corners of shots and shapes even the most casual scenes decisively. ""American Gangster"" has been made with great panache and drive. And it pushes us hard--it asks us to accept the audacity of Franks methods as not only brave but wittily inventive. Flying to Bangkok in 1968 Frank against all advice makes his way through the jungle to northern Thailand where a courtly Chinese officer--a member of the long-defeated Kuomintang--supervises vast poppy fields. The officer who may never have seen a black American before has trouble believing that Frank is capable of taking a hundred or more kilos of uncut heroin into the United States without sponsorship (that is without the Mafia). But the dope in pure form arrives in New York (in spectacularly bizarre fashion) gets cut by naked female ""table workers"" in Harlem and is sold on the street at twice the strength and half the price of what the Mafia is selling. Frank has achieved the retailers dream he has eliminated the middleman and the competition in a single blow. Later he summons his five brothers from North Carolina and sets them up in dry-cleaning and auto-repair shops that serve as distribution points; he also buys his elderly mother (Ruby Dee) a huge white-columned house in New Jersey where she presides at jubilant family dinners. Like many modern gangsters Frank wants to turn crime into a rational enterprise; he wants to lead an orderly and loving family life and to play his game so stealthily that he will never be tainted by what he does. And the audience may go along with his self-conception which also appears to be the moviemakers conception--that Frank is a cool guy always shrewd enough to put a coaster under the drinks and leave no marks behind. Denzel Washingtons movie-star glow is all-powerful here. Grinning broadly between fits of rage his Frank Lucas is quicker smarter and more charming than anyone else around. He takes the overt menace out of such lines as ""Im a busy man I got no time to be going to anyones funeral."" He makes it seem less a threat of murder (which it is) than a casual joke. Frank doesnt have to worry much about being caught by the N.Y.P.D. since groups of narcotics officers led by a goon in black leather (Josh Brolin) occupy themselves with shaking down dealers or selling impounded drugs back to the Mafia. (The movie presents these guys as outrageous creeps who put law enforcement on a lower level than outright criminality.) Trying to get clear of the force Richie accepts a federal assignment to set up his own group of irregulars. Scott introduces us to this skanky-looking bunch in a New Jersey bar but he doesnt do much with them. The driving force is always Richie whom Crowe plays with shambling low-key intensity. He keeps his voice down and stays calm and logical--as if he knew that it was the only way to compete with Washingtons bravura. Our loyalties are split between the hero of virtue and the hero of vice. We dont have to choose which is fine--irresponsibility is one of the pleasures of narrative movies. But can we accept the movies glorification of Frank Lucas in the terms in which its offered? Its true that movie audiences have always relished gangsters. They act out our fantasies of unlimited aggression and when they are punished with death we are purged of the guilt weve felt from enjoying their rampages. The greatest gangster movies however deepen this transaction taking us closer to the gangsters hopes and illusions and then turning them inside out. In ""The Godfather Part II"" Michael Corleone grows in power and then ravages his family--the thing he most wanted to protect--and we can see him rotting like a dead oak. In ""Goodfellas"" Ray Liottas narration revels in the abundant pleasures of criminality but as the bad times keep coming the narration turns anxious and finally harrowing. In ""American Gangster"" however Franks ascent is presented simply--not with irony or as a mini-tragedy or as a cruel joke on his own community but as a long-delayed victory of black capitalism. The Mafia represented by Dominic Cattano (Armand Assante) an immensely dignified grandee condescends to Frank but then offers to buy some of his product at a discounted rate. The Mafia in effect works for Frank who winds up again and again impressing people not disposed to be impressed by a black man. The movie associates him with Muhammad Ali and for an instant with Martin Luther King Jr. Franks success were meant to believe is a strike against racism. Its not as if Zaillian and Scott ignore the results of Franks trade. On the contrary there are innumerable shots of needles going into the arms of black men and women in Harlem who then waver from the dope like palm fronds in the heat. But none of this devastation alters the approving portrayal of Frank. After a while the shallowness of his characterization and the movies glib impassivity become a little unnerving and viewers may ask why its supposed to be better that hundreds maybe thousands of people in Harlem were destroyed by black gangsters rather than by Italians. Near the end of the movie Franks mother in the iconic person of Ruby Dee slaps him across the face but that moral judgment comes too late and it isnt prepared for. When is cool no longer cool? In the documentary ""Frank Lucas"" to be aired on BETs series ""American Gangster"" on October 31st you see the real Frank Lucas now in his late seventies. He is every bit as gifted as you would expect. Hes also boastful cynical and as far as we can see dead to the bottom of the place where his soul should be.
