Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; winter-s-tale ) Winters Tale (United States 2014) February 14 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli We live in a cynical world. A romantic fairy tale like Winters Tale might have worked better in a kinder gentler age but in todays era of sarcasm and scorn its flaws (of which there are many) are magnified. For something this sentimental to work one has to approach it with full willingness to ignore narrative inconsistencies and willingly suspend disbelief. The movie demands a lot that many viewers wont be willing to give. Can you accept Will Smith as Satan? Can you believe that when people die they become stars? Can you buy into the concept of an eternal war between good and evil playing out on the streets of New York? Winters Tale asks these things and more from viewers and in the end fails to deliver a story capable of satisfying even those who want to be drawn into Akiva Goldsmans mystically-influenced clone of our reality. The movie transpires in two time periods with the first half unspooling in 1915 and the second half in 2014. Though a century separates beginning from end Peter Lake looks much the same thereby sparing lead actor Colin Farrell the necessity of applying old age makeup. In the World War I-era Peter is a petty thief who breaks into the house of newspaper publisher Isaac Penn (William Hurt). The only one at home is Penns beautiful daughter Beverly (Jessica Brown Findlay) who is dying of consumption. Peter and Beverly fall hopelessly in love and against all odds Peter earns Isaacs respect and admiration. Unfortunately Peter is caught at the nexus of a supernatural struggle. Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe) a demon masquerading as a gangster wants to kill Peter before he can fulfill his destiny of initiating a miracle. Meanwhile to balance things God has sent Peter a flying white horse who can spirit him away from danger when the need arises. When the movie skips forward in time some of the characters have changed but the supernatural struggle remains the same with Pearly once again attempting to thwart Peter. On a purely narrative level Winters Tale missteps early and often. Its earnestness is its downfall resulting in opportunities for unintentional humor. Goldsman asks viewers to believe in this mystical vision of the world without providing a credible reason why we should. ""Hard to swallow"" only begins to describe some of the plot contortions Winters Tale offers. Yes this is a tale of fantasy and the supernatural but it abrogates its responsibility to make its reality genuine for the audience. Goldsman a veteran Hollywood screenwriter is making his directorial debut. For his supporting cast he has plundered past productions in which he has been involved employing the services of Russell Crowe (from Cinderella Man and A Beautiful Mind) Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind) and Will Smith (I am Legend and I Robot). Colin Farrell who has taken the Matthew McConaughey route of choosing offbeat roles almost makes us accept his character through sheer force of personality. Jessica Brown Findlay known to millions around the world as Lady Sybil Branson in Downton Abbey plays a peculiar Hollywood staple the terminal woman who grows more gorgeous as the hour of her demise approaches. Despite woefully written roles Farrell and Findlay display enough chemistry to cause viewers to become invested in their romance - at least for the 40-or-so minutes when its a plot element. If nothing else Winters Tale looks fabulous. This is due in no small part to the efforts of master cinematographer Caleb Deschanel who understands how to use light and color to set a scene and establish a mood. Various frosty images stand out including a memorable one in which lovers Peter and Beverly stroll through a winterscape. In tangible ways Deschanels contributions are more forceful and lasting than anything provided by the actors. The movies sincerity makes it an easy target for snarky comments but its the waterfall of artifice that drowns the story. I respect Goldsman for having the courage to offer up an unvarnished melodrama but his screenplay fails to convincingly transport the viewer into the state of mind where the contrivances become organic to the story. Instead of magic we get trickery. Viewers can spot the difference and it results in an easily mocked experience. What Goldsman attempts is laudable; the way he goes about it isnt.

"(Re)Made for Love << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The B.S. Report Anthony Davis  Next The Road Not Taken Facebook Twitter Print Movies (Re)Made for Love Hollywoods on the rebound for Valentines Day by Wesley Morris on February 14 2014 Valentines Day is intermittently a big deal to the movie industry. The more aligned February 14 is with a Wednesday or a weekend the crazier it gets. But for every Nicholas Sparks bulls-eye theres something with Adam Sandler Hannibal Lecter or a passel of soon-to-be-dead teens. This year the 14th is a Friday and that means movies are those partners who show they care by totally going overboard. Not only are there a pair of romances and a sex comedy this week but 75 percent of the new major-studio releases are based on movies that already exist. You may love love stories. Hollywood loves remakes. The new RoboCop stars Joel Kinnaman as Alex Murphy a Detroit detective and family man whos killed by crooks and revivified by corporate science. Gary Oldman preserves Murphys brain lungs and long handsome face and builds them an elaborate armor. A slick defense contractor (Michael Keaton) wants to sell the result -- a multibillion-dollar walking tank -- to the government. Theres a liberal moral-minded senator (Zach Grenier) breathing down Keatons neck and Oldmans scientist suspects he might have a Frankenstein situation on his hands. His creation -- RoboCop -- yearns for wife Abbie Cornish and their son while remaining determined to solve his own murder. All this goes on after Iranian insurgents strike back against the U.S. government robot soldiers that roam the streets of Tehran. A quick Google search would have informed our hero that the same thing happened to another guy named Murphy back in 1987. He was shot dead reborn and fought crime and they called that movie RoboCop too. It was a lean mean satire machine that opened 27 years ago in July. The screenwriters Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner wrote a black comedy about Orwellian capitalism and the Dutch director Paul Verhoeven turned it into a strange mockery of Hollywood action priorities. His RoboCop played by Peter Weller embodied and rebuked the law-enforcement avengers of the 70s and the steroidal action figures of the 80s. Verhoeven gave us a literal killing machine. But his film -- with its droll depiction of a complicit media subplot of beat cops on the verge of a strike and myriad flavors of corrupt CEO -- collapsed the future into the present. In 2014 Verhoevens then still feels like now. This remake is like someone breaking into an ATM. It takes less than 20 seconds to find Verhoevens movie which still feels as if it doesnt have a pure genre. This new version directed by Jose Padilha and written by Joshua Zetumer gives it one. Its more of a straight-up action film about a man fighting for his humanity (and against having his dopamine levels manipulated). Thats not nearly as interesting as the anarchic drollery of the original. You miss Verhoevens borderline heartlessness and his inability to tell the difference between good acting and bad (Nancy Allen played Murphys police partner like an 80s sitcom kid sister). That sounds like a put-down but with Verhoeven it just means theres no artifice to the performances. Theres a rawness to everything and the rawness feels real. This new version goes for realness too. This time Michael K. Williams is Murphys partner -- hes the sort of no-frills actor Verhoeven would love. The movie also tries to make a character of Detroit but that doesnt go far. Murphy is engineered in a Chinese factory and exported to the erstwhile Motor City. The irony is cruel and cruelly unexamined. But you never resent it as much as you might want to; the new RoboCop is smart in its limited way. Jennifer Ehle plays an icy corporate lawyer and Jay Baruchel is perfect as Keatons sleazy marketing man. Meanwhile Samuel L. Jackson hosts a hawkish cable-news show in an Al Sharpton perm and the movie grazes todays unique ideological scramble of a liberal presidential administration embracing right-leaning security stances. Happily Padilha is more than a hack. He doesnt fear long shots for one thing. They give RoboCop his due as a physical specimen. In a moment of post-traumatic stress he breaks out of the lab and on to a vast factory floor packed with Chinese workers in pink lab coats then into a rice paddy. The camera trails below him then above. Padilha also gets the movies satire of defense capitalism. When insurgent martyrs strike back against whatever it is the film has the U.S. doing in Tehran the Pentagon cuts the feed to Jacksons news program. This is a thinking action thriller. You laugh at the baldness of a conspiracy whose ladder spans the top of the government down into the Detroit Police Department. Padilha is Brazilian and its interesting that both RoboCops have been made by men whose non-Hollywood work focused on their respective countries curdled politics. Padilha devised the hostage documentary Bus 174 and two Elite Squad action-thrillers and they all deftly asserted that systemic government corruption and neglect of the lower classes breed criminality. Padilhas RoboCop runs on a sentimentality absent from both his other work and Verhoevens original. Murphy just wants to get home to his family and his family needs him to come home to them. But the movie has no idea what to do with the perversity of this new dynamic which seems ripe for a returning-war-veteran allegory. But the movie does something Verhoeven couldnt have in 1987 It loosens up racial and political positions. The liberal anti-drone senator has the humorless doggedness the entertainment industry usually saves for conservatives. And the conservative here is Samuel L. Jackson who more than meets his contractually obligated use of ""motherfucker."" Kinnaman plays pre-RoboCop Murphy in the same black tones he used to play an ex-junkie detective on AMCs The Killing. When Williamss character sees Murphy in ebony armor he says ""Least I know you the right color now."" Which is to say Kinnamans RoboCop gives the action franchise something else thats timely its own Macklemore.  I didnt think of the Endless Love remake as an old Hollywood melodrama. But it is Social mores are breached social mores erupt. Its just never interesting enough to get you thinking about anything. Like the original this version is based on Scott Spencers 1979 novel which was turned into a notorious 1981 Franco Zeffirelli movie with Brooke Shields and Martin Hewitt as two different kinds of rich kids in love. (""She is 15. He is 17"" read the poster. ""The love every parent fears."") Spencers book is a good overblown adult novel that Zeffirelli and screenwriter Judith Rascoe turned into an extra-strength after-school special about sexual obsession. Charmingly Zeffirelli didnt seem to get that he wasnt doing Verdi or Shakespeare but he didnt seem to know he was making a movie either. His direction was unruly and arbitrary two hours of unmowed lawn. But this remake has almost nothing to do with Spencers novel. Its the kind of film you make when youve run out of Nicholas Sparks books. Its set in the South instead of Chicago. The story -- in which a hot working-class kid (Alex Pettyfer) fights for a rich virginal blonde (Gabriella Wilde) -- has Sparks flavoring. There are Secrets. When the boys thrown in jail the girl screams at her father ""Get him out I love him"" The father is played by Bruce Greenwood who tries to make this all seem emotionally plausible as is a good actors wont. But the movie needs him to swap plain old paternity for villainous tiger-dadding -- you know No boys for you daughter just this medical internship. And Why cant you be more like my other son? Whos dead Shana Feste is the director. Shes the one who put the ""try"" in Country Strong -- but that movie at least coughed up a few wonders mostly with the actors. Feste was going for Nashville authenticity there. This time she appears to be aiming for the top of the box office. All of the books bizarre psychological behavior is gone the come-ons the arson the mental illness the sexual assault that downbeat ending. The stars are British models doing American accents and you never believe them. Wilde just spends the movie galloping in and out of rooms. This isnt acting so much as steeplechase. The new movie throws in one friend (Dayo Okeniyi) for comic relief and one (Emma Rigby) for sexual comedy. The latter is a jealous ex -- and brunette -- who at some point finds herself on the edge of a bed with her chest and lips puffed out and stomach sucked in while in the right of the frame Pettyfer stands in the bathroom staring forlornly into a mirror. Thats not a movie scene. Its a Guess Jeans ad. Zeffirelli gave his version heat that you almost never see in movies with young actors now. When Hewitt kissed Shields you were amazed there was anything left of her face. He was hungry for love. Too many actors in the remake just look hungry.  Im no fan of turning one book into 16 movies. But on the way out of Winters Tale the other night I rode the escalator with a woman who said it should have been a series. I didnt read the Mark Helprin novel the movies based on but I did just lift up a hardback copy and nearly threw out my back. Its 672 pages which is to say the woman who loved the book and disliked the movie had a point. Still I dont know that six more hours of Colin Farrell riding a white horse with aurora borealis wings would help. This is a time-travel love fantasy featuring a consumptive English virgin (Jessica Brown Findlay) an Irish burglar (Farrell) his equine spirit animal and a demon gangster (Russell Crowe). There are also an American publishing baron (William Hurt) a dour New York food reporter (Jennifer Connelly) a totally different dying girl (Ripley Sobo) a high-powered newspaper scion (Eva Marie Saint) and two appearances by Lucifer whos played wearing a blazer T-shirt and vest by a Very Famous Movie Star in a not-so-secret cameo. I wont detail how these people connect to each other because should you wind up at this mess youll need a reason to laugh. The director and writer is the veteran Hollywood screenwriter and producer Akiva Goldsman whos done it all -- The Client Batman amp; Robin Cinderella Man A Beautiful Mind The Da Vinci Code I Am Legend. This is his debut as a director and I wish there were more to say about it than ""Come again now?"" He cant make you care about one world let alone the cosmic collision of two. Whenever someone asks why something happens to be the response tends to be something like ""Those are the rules."" Theyre just never made clear to us so it seems as though Goldsman is simply making things up as he goes. We never come to understand the magic that keeps Farrell looking like a member of My Chemical Romance for 10 decades. We never know why consumption makes women sexy. Most of the actors here have previously worked with Goldsman who it seems has called in several favors. (Would Connelly have her Oscar without him?) They all give their roles lots of tears and passion -- even the Very Famous Movie Star. But its a waste. If youve got these actors in your movie why are you bothering with magic at all? The magic should be them.  The best of this weeks remakes and the best of this weeks romances is also the least likely combination of the two. About Last Night is just like the 1986 movie of the same name (but without any ellipses). Now Michael Ealy Joy Bryant Kevin Hart and Regina Hall are in roles that Rob Lowe Demi Moore James Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins were all miscast in. Both movies are based on David Mamets 1974 play Sexual Perversity in Chicago. The play now feels like Mamet for beginners but the foundation is still solid enough for a sex comedy. In the new movie directed by Steve Pink and written by Leslye Headland who wrote and directed Bachelorette two coworkers (Ealy and Hart) have drinks with two roommates (Bryant and Hall). Hart and Hall have slept together once before. The movie delivers a play-by-play of the sex and just listening to Hall exclaim to Bryant that Harts pecker is the ""John Legend of penises"" is like going to sitcom-banter heaven. The whole movie is like that loud fast quippy made-for-TV. When Hart and Hall get fantastically drunk before going to have more sex in a bathroom Ealy walks Bryant home and a more traditional relationship starts. Hart and Hall fight and fuck and then fight some more while Ealy and Bryant who are both elegant natural actors drift into domestic malaise. None of what follows is profound. But the movies got energy and lewdness and warmth.1 Headlands script expands the parameters of Mamets play to make the women as funny as the men in the play think they are. This film has the looseness of a movie made of outtakes -- but they mostly work and they mostly involve Hall and Hart. Theyre the undercard that takes over the movie. Hall was Anna Fariss copilot in out-on-a-limb nonsense at the start of the Scary Movie series. And I always worry that the studios forget what she can do with a so-so comedy -- like knock Hart to the floor with laughter as she does toward the end of this movie. Shes great here using her body and her voice to bring something newly human out of her costar. So much of Harts shtick asks us to believe in his sexiness before he pulls a rug out from under it. What hes lacked are partners as credible as Ealy and Hall. He had his moments with Alan Arkin in Grudge Match but Arkin wast sparring with him -- he was flyswatting. Ride Along has made him a box office star but About Last Night makes a case for Hart as the kind of romantic comedian wholl stop humping your leg long enough to ask how your day was. The movie also has Ealy and Bryant in Ike and Tina Halloween costumes which means that after Jay Zs reference to them on Beyonces ""Drunk in Love"" it might be time to revisit why thats too loaded an allusion for so much glibness.

PICTURES BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Winters TaleStarring Colin Farrell Jessica Brown Findlay Russell Crowe Directed by Akiva Goldsman Running time 1 hour 58 minutes Rated PG-13 for violence and some sensuality Playing Throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitThis flight of fancy about the love between a burglar and a newspaper heiress never achieves liftoff. Grade C- If there were a ""clap if you believe in fairies"" moment in this would-be magical movie viewers would sit on their hands. Its so filled with high-flown blather about love destiny and miracles that theres no room for enchantment. The writer-director Akiva Goldsman extracts the romance between reformed thief Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) and newspaper tycoons daughter Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay) from Mark Helprins much-loved 768-page novel along with other elements like a Pegasus-like horse and an evil crime boss Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe) who wants Peter dead. The filmmaker puts them all into his own neat patterns. Ive read enough of the book to know that its charm comes from inviting readers to enter an enigmatic world - a phantasmagoric New York City seen at either end of the 20th century - and to savor its mysteries not explain them away. The movie explicates everything; its off-putting rather than inviting. Though Beverly is fading from consumption her fevers give her second sight. In one of several flossy speeches she declares that magic is ubiquitous time and distance are elusive and ""there is a world behind the world where we are all connected."" In this fantasy universe each person holds a unique miracle. Guardian angels - like that flying white horse - show up to help realize the miracle though a demon like Pearly may commit himself to stomping it out. (As Pearly Crowe does everything rabid an actor can do except foam at the mouth.) Goldsman has tried to create a stirring seductive fable yoking Peters amorous fate - his quest to save Beverly - to a battle between good and evil. But this filmmaker has no gift for mythology or adventure. He fills the movie with hairbreadth escapes headlong chases and fantastical fights that he cant quite bring off. (He is after all a first-time director better known as a writer for movies like ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Cinderella Man."") The films grandiosity squelches Farrell and Findlays flirtatious spark; theyre at their best when Peter and Beverly ""meet cute"" during his attempted burglary of her house. (Farrell has another half-good scene when her father played by William Hurt gives him a laconic grilling). Set mostly in the early 20th century the movie teases us with glimpses of Peter in 2014 (the book jumps to 1999) until the action finally settles there. Still young but afflicted with amnesia Peter spends his days doing chalk pavement drawings of a red-haired girl. In Central Park he meets a gorgeous food writer (Jennifer Connelly) who works for the Penns newspaper (still in business still family-owned); her young daughter has been fighting cancer. What can it all mean? Take it away Beverly ""There is a great dance"" she says ""and we all have our part. And when we are done here after one life or a thousand we rise up into the sky and we become stars."" This movie is too fancy and too literal. It contains too many twinkling stars.

Their love or the ache of its absence takes place in three different years 1895 1916 and 2014. The period detail is impressive; the romanticism is gooey.Peters nemesis is his mentor in crime the (literally) demonic Pearly Somes played by Russell Crowe in a gutteral mode that threatened at any moment to turn operatic. (Fortunately it doesnt. Im still recovering from his warbling in ""Les Miserables."") Goldsman directing his first feature is trying to achieve a fairy-tale radiance not an easy achievement even for a seasoned pro. Most of the time the magic on view is distinctly unmagical - too many twinkling stars.Hes pretty good with actors though and hes stocked his cast with additional worthies including Eva Marie Saint William Hurt Jennifer Connelly and in an unbilled cameo Will Smith as no less than Lucifer. If only there was less mush and more meat in this stew. Grade C+ (Rated PG-13 for violence and some sensuality.)

Lee Warner Bros. Entertainment)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourStars Colin Farrell Jessica Brown Findlay Russell Crowe Matt Bomer William Hurt Jennifer ConnellyRated PG-13; runtime 1 hour 58 minutes; opens Friday nationwideDont be swayed by the title The forced and far-fetched Winters Taleshould not be confused with Shakespeares similarly titled play.Its also not a worthy adaptation of Mark Helprins acclaimed 1983 novel on which the saga is based.This sappy time-traveling love story ( out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) seems instead as if it sprang from the pages of a Harlequin romance.Not only is the story of magic angels demons and predetermined destiny preposterous but the characters are also unconvincing and the dialogue sanctimonious. ""Everything is connected by light"" intones the grating narration. But in this elaborate flight of fancy set in New York City the blend of fantasy and reality is disconnected and convoluted.STORY Colin Farrell spins a great TaleREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersDestinies cross and an unlikely pair falls in love while Satan and his henchmen lurk ominously.Oscar-winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind) makes his directorial debut with this overly ambitious saga that awkwardly combines imagery from Christianity Greek mythology New Age notions fairy tales magical realism and TVs Touched by an Angel. Goldsman seems unsure what story hes telling a timeless romance or a sci-fi thriller? He doesnt accomplish either.The cast is impressive but hamstrung by the inane plot. Despite a bad haircut the actor who best acquits himself is Colin Farrell who plays Peter Lake a thief who falls in love with tuberculosis-stricken heiress Beverly Penn (Downton Abbeys Jessica Brown Findlay). The pair has moments of chemistry though its hard to understand why shes enchanted rather than dismayed when she stumbles on Peter burglarizing her familys mansion. Shes struggling with a deadly illness and Peter is a marked man hunted by the diabolical Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe). The scar-faced Soames works for the big bad guy himself Lucifer (Will Smith).Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Colin Farell stars in a love story that defies time in Winters Tale. VPCPeter was abandoned as a baby in 1895 when his sickly immigrant parents were turned away at Ellis Island. They left him at sea sailing toward New York in a basket Moses-style as they returned to Europe. Soames tutored Peter in the art of thievery but in his early 20s the charming Peter is trying to go legit.Peter spends a good portion of his time inexplicably lurking in the rafters of Grand Central Station both in the early 1900s and again in 2014. Despite the passage of a century he doesnt age. He has however lost the bad haircut and grown a beard. A sub-plot involving his association with a sickly little girl named Abby (Ripley Sobo) and her mother Virginia (Jennifer Connelly) makes up most of the contemporary portion of the story during which Peter is still plagued by Pearly.Its all patently absurd depicted in a simultaneously solemn and sloppy fashion. Peter is saved from the clutches of Pearly and his minions by a mystical white steed that gallops by in the nick of time and swoops him up. The Pegasus-like horse then flies over Manhattan with Peter hanging on for dear life. They become partners. Peter chats up his equine savior addressing him unimaginatively as ""Horse."" The stallion nods when Peter talks to him. You half expect to hear the creature speak in a throaty vibrato (but thankfully the film stops short of Mr. Ed turf).Lurching back and forth through time Winters Tale tries to blend the supernatural and the sentimental with a synchronous nod to elements of New York history. But this would-be magical romance flounders hitting only dissonant chords. 56 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1b0RJEz",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/02/13/winters-tale-review/4988591/,200,winter'stale9,winter'stale,usatoday
"Review Colin Farrell and Winters Tale unabashedly romantic - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Colin Farrell and Winters Tale unabashedly romantic Winters Tale Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Winters Tale starring Colin FarrelRussell Crowe Will Smith Jessica Brown Findlay William Hurt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Winters Tale starring Colin FarrelRussell Crowe Will Smith Jessica Brown Findlay William Hurt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Winters Tale"" is so obviously a passion project so much a labor of love for industry veteran Akiva Goldsman that youd like to be able to say its a complete success. It isnt but the parts that do succeed especially the fervor between stars Colin Farrell and Jessica Brown Findlay provide such lush emotional magic that unabashed romantics will be pleased.Co-produced written and directed by Goldsman ""Winters Tale"" has been drastically pared from Mark Helprins nearly 700-page 1983 literary blockbuster. That novel is so complex and massive the films story of love as a miracle that can save us all feels as much suggested by characters and themes of the original as it does an adaptation. Though hes recently done directing on televisions ""The Fringe"" Goldsman is best known as a screenwriter on projects such as ""The Da Vinci Code"" ""Cinderella Man"" and his Oscar-winning work on ""A Beautiful Mind"" credits that indicate he has never been shy about taking on emotional situations.PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013 That tendency was given a terrible wrench when Goldsmans wife died suddenly of a heart attack while he was working on this script. When he was able to return to writing Goldsman told The Times Glenn Whipp ""the book suddenly went from something I loved to the only thing that mattered"" and he decided to direct the material as well.Before the romance fully takes hold ""Winters Tale"" lets us know that its set in a kind of alternate-universe New York a world much like our own but one where magic and the supernatural are factors and the clash between good and evil is fought out one life at a time.Setting up this universes rules is one of ""Winters Tales"" weaker points There is so much to tell us that its hard to take it all in. Suffice it to say that in this world helpful spirit animals magically appear individuals have a shot at ascending to the heavens and becoming stars when they die and the devil and his demons take human form so much the better to stop miracles that are victories for the other side.Love it will come as no surprise is the biggest wonder of all. The key piece of information ""Winters Tale"" insists on is that ""inside each of us is a miracle a miracle intended for one person alone."" The good forces in the universe try to aid this process the evil ones to stop it in its tracks. PHOTOS Bad romances on film""Winters Tale"" visits this world in three years -- 1895 1916 and 2014 -- and thanks to Caleb Deschanels gorgeous cinematography one of the films strengths it looks luminous and magical at all times.After a brief prologue we meet protagonist Peter Lake (Farrell) in 1916. Hes a master thief on the run from former boss Pearly Soames head of the Short Tails Gang who is so unhappy with Peter going out on his own he wants to kill him.Seriously overplayed by Russell Crowe (another of the films problems) Pearly is not just a vengeful gangster hes a full-fledged demon in league with the devil himself bound and determined to keep those personal miracles from happening.Making things difficult for Pearly is Athansor an honest-to-god flying horse who happens to be Peters helpful spirit guide. This gorgeous animal played by an all-white Andalusian named Listo elevates every scene hes in both literally and metaphorically.Its Athansor who leads Peter to Beverly Penn (""Downton Abbeys"" Brown Findlay) a wealthy newspaper magnates daughter who just happens to be a) drop-dead gorgeous and b) burning up with an advanced case of consumption that threatens to end her life at any moment. ""What"" Peter says to Athansor ""have you gotten me into?""PHOTOS Greatest box office flopsSay what you will about the rest of ""Winters Tale"" (and people will) there is real magic between Brown Findlay and Farrell in their scenes together which the films carefully crafted atmospheric visuals do their best to capture and enhance. This is shamelessly romantic ultra-sentimental material so anyone yearning for something reminiscent of Lars von Trier or Quentin Tarantino had best look elsewhere.Once ""Winters Tales"" convoluted plot leaves this couple and goes down other paths much of the magic leaves with it. Though Eva Marie Saint has a lovely cameo many of the other actors including Crowe Jennifer Connelly and William Hurt as Beverlys father dont seem to have a firm grasp on their parts or where they fit into this winding saga.Because it is fearlessly sincere and not totally successful ""Winters Tale"" is easy to mock. But it is also hard not to admire its willingness to go all out in its quest for the grandest of romantic gestures. Magic like that is hard to come by both on screen and off.kenneth.turanlatimes.com----------------------------------Winters TaleMPAA rating PG-13 for violence and some sensualityRunning time 2 hours 9 minutesIn general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Reviews Colin Farrell Russell Crowe A Beautiful Mind (movie) Downton Abbey Winters Tale Colin Farrell turns romantic in the fantasy film Winters Tale Review Colin Farrell and Winters Tale unabashedly romantic Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-winters-tale-review-20140214,0,4866722.story#axzz2tFyFFcYE",200,winter'stale10,winter'stale,latimes
"Winters Tale movie turns a silk purse into sows ear review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWinters Tale movie turns a silk purse into sows ear reviewConsidering how badly Akiva Goldsman pillages Winters Tale he might as well have gone whole hog and swapped Pink Floyds flying porker for the winged white horse that is central to the saga.Colin Farrell sporting quite the haircut and Jessica Brown Findlay romp with an equine friend in Winters Tale.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Feb. 13 2014Winters TaleStarring Colin Farrell Russell Crowe Jessica Brown Findlay Jennifer Connelly William Hurt Eva Marie Saint and Will Smith. Written and directed by Akiva Goldsman. Opens Feb. 14 at GTA theatres. 118 minutes. PGConsidering how badly Akiva Goldsman pillages Winters Tale he might as well have gone whole hog and swapped Pink Floyds flying porker for the winged white horse that is central to the saga.It would be the most fitting way of showing how hes turned the silk purse that is author Mark Helprins original prose and storytelling into the sows ear of this misbegotten screen adaptation.Article Continued BelowEnduring this soppy muddle of twinkling stars fluttering wings refracted points of light and destiny-led swooners is like being forced to listen at length to a crazy person at a street corner read out old Hallmark greeting cards.Theres a good reason why longtime screenwriters often dont succeed when they try their hand at directing films as Goldsman does here for the first time after a career of hits (Oscar winner A Beautiful Mind) and misses (Batman amp; Robin Lost in Space). They tend to resist having their words cut to suit the films visual medium requiring an objective eye ear and mind behind the blade. No such luck here with Goldsman not only writing and directing but also producing what amounts to a colossal vanity project.Theres also a reason a book of Winters Tale vast splendourhas often been described as ""unfilmable."" The nearly 700 pages of Helprins acclaimed 1983 novel spanning more than a century in a supernatural New York alive with winged steeds vengeful demons technological marvels and spirited humans simply cant be intelligently crammed into a two-hour movie.Especially not the way Goldsman has done it which was to evidently rip out about 300 pages at random and to stitch together what was left over. Hes chucked much of Helprins lyrical and metaphorical narrative and wealth of characters preferring to pull the tear-jerking threads about dying beauties consumptive newspaper heiress Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay) and youthful cancer victim Abby (Ripley Sobo). Sure its a movie aimed at a Valentines Day audience but this is like breaking your tooth while crunching down hard on a cinnamon heart.And the major plot omissions leave us scratching our heads over many things such as why Colin Farrells orphan thief character Peter Lake is so hated by Russell Crowes demonic Pearly Soames who grunts with a bad Irish accent.The two have a long history together that is only hinted at in the film one akin to Dickens Artful Dodger and Fagin yet Goldsman weirdly finds room to stuff in a character not found in the book Will Smiths take on Lucifer a funky cellar-dweller in earrings and a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt who dispenses peevish ""rules"" (barely explained) to his satanic minion Soames.Smiths here because as Variety reports Goldsman called in markers from his celebrity friends from other films hes been involved with. Smith starred in I Am Legend which Goldsman wrote and produced. Similar career connections also explain the presence of A Beautiful Minds Crowe and Jennifer Connelly (who plays a journalist in Winters Tale) and Lost in Spaces William Hurt (who plays a press tycoon). This leaves the great Eva Marie Saint making her first big-screen appearance in eight years in the role of a newspaper publisher who evidently doesnt owe Goldsman any favours. We can only assume she loved the book but didnt read the screenplay.This is all very chummy but not much of a basis on which to pursue the screen adaptation of a novel and story that would be a challenge even for a great writer and director neither of which Goldsman is.Not helping at all is cinematographer Caleb Deschanel who shoots with a dull and lifeless lens that fails to fully exploit the many NYC landmarks the film whirls past. But we must at least applaud the selection of Farrell for main character Lake a mysterious time traveller who takes Manhattan from the 1895 up through 2014. That twinkle in his eye suggests that he knows hes caught in a steaming load one that requires him to sport a lopsided haircut (I call it the Permanent Tidal Wave) while riding a flying white horse with badly conjured CGI wings. Hey the moneys good and the cheque cashed so Farrell might as well grin and make the best of it.We might further extend critical charity to Findlay best known from TVs Downton Abbey who brings sensitivity and romance to the thankless role of a doomed recluse. As for the rest the less said the better -- other than to note the luck of the minor character who gets shot and killed in the films first half-hour.He gets to check out of Winters Tale early. The rest of have to sit through another 90 minutes of it.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Kristin Tillotson StribKristin Like the frozen expanses of its most dramatic settings ""Winters Tale"" is mostly hard glittering surface. Colin Farrell as Peter Lake a tortured time traveler straddling two lives a century apart in New York City brings the only performance warm enough to penetrate it. As an infant in 1895 Peter is left in a bobbing miniature boat to wash ashore in New York City by his immigrant parents after they are rejected at Ellis Isle. Fast-forward a generation and hes a thief on the run from his former gang. In the midst of robbing an Upper West Side mansion Peter encounters ephemeral pianist Beverly who is 21 gorgeous and dying of consumption. Jessica Brown Findlay who played Lady Sybil on ""Downton Abbey"" is once again a doomed rich damsel who falls for a bad boy beneath her station. Farrell employs his trademark inverted-eyebrow gymnastics to great effect here distracting from the ugliest variation on the bowl haircut since young Dick Whitman on ""Mad Men."" Hes so fetching as a besotted beau that Findlay need only toss her mane about and make breathy declarations about the importance of light to make their few scenes together sing. Too bad the rest of the movie lumbers along like a shackled version of the sprawling novel on which its based. Published 30 years ago Mark Helprins book was adored for both its love story and its vividly drawn magical realism. First-time director Akiva Goldsman the sci-fi screenwriter behind ""I Robot"" and ""I Am Legend"" focuses on the latter at the formers expense and not always successfully. His attempts at depicting fantasy -- in particular Peters spirit animal a white horse that sprouts iridescent wings at convenient moments -- translate as Disney Channel kiddie kitsch. As Peters nemesis alpha-thug Pearly Soames Russell Crowe plays it more like hes Growly Ham. He pulls off a few genuinely sinister moments between bouts of shameless mugging. Will Smith as his boss ""Judge"" aka Lucifer is too hilarious to fear providing unintentional but welcome comic relief. William Hurt as Beverlys father and Eva Marie Saint as the 21st-century embodiment of Beverlys younger sister add depth but Jennifer Connelly barely makes an impression as a journalist who helps modern-day amnesiac Peter find clues to his past. Goldsman should have used a cheaper unknown and spent the savings on better props like 100-year-old tombstones that dont look freshly constructed by the art department. winters tale  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for violence and some sensuality. Despite Farrells valiant efforts to heat things up this Valentines Day opening is sentimental artifice in search of true heart.

If youre writer-director Akiva Goldsman you take a meat tenderizer and hammer away until all thats left is romantic-fantasy mush. Colin Farrell plays a heroic burglar in pre-WWI Manhattan Jessica Brown Findlay (""Downton Abbey"") is the rich girl he loves and Russell Crowe is a demonic (no really) gang leader after Farrells soul. Throw in a flying horse hit-or-miss digital sets a miscast Special Guest Star as Satan and endless pseudo-philosophical banalities on the soundtrack and you have an acceptable date-night guilty pleasure.

In 2028 Detroit when Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is critically injured in the line of duty the conglomerate OmniCorp sees their chance for a part-man part-robot police officer. (Photo/Video Sony) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Feb. 13 2014 225 p.m. ET When RoboCops helmet isnt down in combat mode his Achilles heel is his head. The same goes for this muddle-brained remake with Joel Kinnaman as Alex Murphy the shattered human trapped in the high-tech armor. Its not that the filmmakers--Jose Padilha directing from a screenplay by Joshua Zetumer--havent worked hard to retrofit Paul Verhoevens 1987 sci-fi classic for duty in the 21st century. But theyve overburdened their story with underbaked notions about U.S. militarism corporate greed the importance of empathy and the nature of consciousness as well as robotics versus what the film calls organics--not pesticide-free veggies but free-willed flesh and blood that in the case of unlucky Alex has been reprogrammed for ruthless efficiency. The result is fitfully interesting and Mr. Kinnaman best known for ""The Killing"" on television compels our empathy with a kind of macho melancholia. Still the whole thing comes down to an action adventure thats graphics-rich logic-poor coherence-challenged and pleasure-impaired. The first few seconds promise something brighter. Over the familiar MGM logo at just the moment Leo the Lion is supposed to roar we hear a charmingly bizarre sound somewhere between a babble and a trill. Thats it for levity though. The sound turns out to be the vocal warmup exercise of a TV personality named Pat Novak. An odious ultranationalist with a booming voice he is played in sledgehammer style thats supposed to be satirical by Samuel L. Jackson. Novak is there to celebrate an occupying force of giant robots that as his viewers see in a live report patrol the streets of a terrified Tehran as part of something called Operation Freedom. (Note to Irans emerging moderates its only a movie guys.) ""Its great"" Novak chortles ""to see American machines promoting peace and freedom abroad."" So what does this jingoism have to do with patrolling the streets of Detroit? (Yes RoboCop still works for the Detroit Police Department; for all its variations and speculations the script sticks close to the original structure.) In the films echo-mimicry of current events robots on foreign soil evoke drones--the terms are used interchangeably--and drones provoke a debate about using robot cops on U.S. soil. ""Why"" Novak laments ""is America so robophobic?"" This leads to still another debate about designing a robocop thats acceptable to the American public. ""Weve gotta give Americans a product they can love"" says a cynical corporate executive played by Michael Keaton ""a product with a conscience something that knows what its like to be human."" The countervailing argument--the law-and-order position in the context of the cartoony dialectic--becomes clear when Alex is chosen for the prototype and finally activated. Preserving empathy circuits in his brain slows his reflexes. Humanity degrades performance. The argument against so much back-and-forth is that dialectics arent drama. The original ""RoboCop"" became a classic because of the clarity and sly humor with which it dramatized a potent idea. This remake reflecting its era all too accurately bounces from one hyperlinked notion to the next--and one videogamelike simulation to the next--while Alex or whats left of him undergoes acute information overload thanks to networks of security cameras and criminal databases that hes been plugged into. The supporting cast includes Gary Oldman Abbie Cornish Jackie Earle Haley Jennifer Ehle and Marianne Jean-Baptiste. Theyre more fun to watch than Mr. Kinnaman unburdened as they are by solemn significance. Watch a clip from the film ""Winters Tale."" A burglar (Colin Farrell) falls for an heiress as she dies in his arms. When he learns that he has the gift of reincarnation he sets out to save her. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) Winters Tale Earlier this week I received an email from which Ill excerpt the salient passage Please tell me that Winters Tale is a great movie befitting a wonderful book one of my favorites.... It would kill me to see the book butchered so Ill have to rely on your judgment to decide whether to rush to the theater on Friday or pretend it never happened. But please please please give me good news Id like to pretend it never happened but it did and the news is befuddlingly bad though I could be prejudiced because I found the Mark Helprin novel so diffuse and pretentious that I never finished it. Be that as it may a surrealist love story with countless admirers has been reduced by Akiva Goldsmans screen version to a potboiler brimming with treacly preachments. The main one concerns connectivity--not in the digital but the cosmic sense i.e. we are all connected were all part of a grand design. Lets hope so but the movie is a prodigy of disconnection one that perpetrates graceless leaps and hapless lurches of logic in the name of magic realism. Two memorable moments in this regard involve the winged white horse Athansor who serves as guardian angel for the hero Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) across a century of time. Back in the early years of the 20th century when Peter finds the love of his life in the beautiful but sickly Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay) the horse rescues the couple from the demonic Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe floridly guttural) by flying them off a cliff to a frozen river. ""How is that even possible?"" asks Beverly. Shes pleasantly surprised you understand but essentially disconnected from the miracle that has just occurred. (Peters mumbled reply is even more obtuse ""Dunno. The horse."") Later in 21st century Manhattan the horse shows up again on the roof of an apartment building just in time to save the still-young Peter a woman named Virginia (Jennifer Connelly) and her sickly young daughter. ""Theres a horse on the roof"" Virginia says. Its an accurate observation and an amazement if ever there was one. Whats amazing about the scene though is Virginias disconnection from this new miracle--she too registers mild surprise at the most--and the directors disconnection from her bland response. Could anyone have made a creditable movie out of the book? Maybe not; magic realism works best in the privacy of the mind. In fact Mr. Farrell and Ms. Findlay are appealing as the star-crossed lovers Will Smith has an agreeably weird cameo as Lucifer and its lovely to have Eva Marie Saint in a small role asking ""What if we are all unique and the universe loves us all equally?"" But Mr. Goldsman a first-time director though a veteran screenwriter has been done in by the source material. Either he climbed aboard a horse that was too much for him or the universe gave him a bum steer. Watch a clip from the documentary film ""The Last of the Unjust."" In 1975 Claude Lanzmann filmed a series of interviews with Benjamin Murmelstein the only ""Elder of the Jews"" not to have been killed during World War II. (Photo/Video Cohen Media Group) The Last of the Unjust Before making ""Shoah"" his 1985 masterpiece about the Holocaust Claude Lanzmann decided against using documentary footage in favor of interviews--91/2 hours of screen time in the final version devoted to survivors eyewitnesses and ex-Nazis. Almost three decades later in 2013 he completed ""The Last of the Unjust"" which is compact by comparison at 220 minutes and centers on a single extended interview--basically an outtake from ""Shoah""--with a singular figure in Holocaust history. Mr. Lanzmanns subject who sat for the camera in Rome in 1975 is Benjamin Murmelstein the last Jewish elder of the Theresienstadt concentration camp and the only Jewish elder to survive Nazi Germanys campaign of extermination. The new film may not qualify for masterpiece status but its an enthralling portrait of a man--an exceptionally brilliant and articulate man--who personified the courage complexity and moral ambiguity of his tortured time. The films title is a play on another masterpiece Andre Schwartz-Barts novel ""The Last of the Just."" The phrase was first coined not by the filmmaker but by Mr. Murmelstein who used it sardonically to describe himself because hed been accused by fellow Jews of having collaborated with the Nazis in administering Theresienstadt an infamous model camp depicted by Nazi propaganda films as a pleasant place where prisoners played music read books and applied themselves willingly to good clean work. Mr. Murmelstein stood trial after the war. He was acquitted of all charges but questions remained. Mr. Lanzmann who is now 88 raises them again by way of the 1975 interviews which are supplemented by his recent visits to sites of Holocaust horror in Vienna and the Czech Republic. In those earlier conversations Mr. Murmelstein addresses the filmmakers questions and sharp skepticism with formidable passion and a precision verging on total recall. In the process he describes Jewish elders as having been ""between the anvil and the hammer""--negotiating with the Nazis to save their own people--and likens himself as a camp administrator to Sancho Panza ""While others are tilting at windmills hes a calculating realist with two feet on the ground."" He also scorns any notion of the banality of evil as it applies to Adolf Eichmann whom he knew and dealt with frequently as a rabbi in prewar Vienna. Eichmann wasnt banal Mr. Murmelstein says ""he was a demon."" But does the self-styled last of the unjust exonerate himself? The film leaves that of necessity for us to judge. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Easy Money (2010) Joel Kinnaman born of a Swedish mother and an American father stars in this impressive Swedish thriller as Johan ""JW"" Westlund a business student from a working-class family and a man of many parts most of them bogus. What makes JW interesting isnt so much his skewed vision of right and wrong but the ambiguity of his personality. Like the seductive and elusive hero of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" he isnt quite there. The director Daniel Espinosa handles the heros social climbing and the multicultural criminality that surrounds him with great aplomb and relentless energy. ENLARGE Miami Vice (2006) The rap on Colin Farrell has often been that hes a great character actor but not a movie star. Yet hes a star in every sense of the term in Michael Manns big-screen update of his 1980s TV series. Jamie Foxx co-stars in a somewhat lesser role; theyre the contemporary incarnations of Detective James ""Sonny"" Crockett and Detective Ricardo ""Rico"" Tubbs a pair of thoroughbred clotheshorses originally played on the small screen by Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas. Gong Li is Isabella the Chinese-Cuban financial wizard of a globalized drug cartel. ENLARGE Mr. Death The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter Jr. (1999) The Holocaust by reflected light in a distorting mirror. The subject of Errol Morriss remarkable documentary used to build restore and maintain execution machines. He considered himself a humanitarian indeed a benefactor because his machines killed quickly and efficiently. Then he became a prominent Holocaust denier. The film connects those phases of Mr. Leuchters life the better to understand how the Holocaust occurred. Mr. Morris never demonizes his subject or denies his humanity. To the contrary ""Mr. Death"" wants us to see how one of them could also be one of us.

Rather than throw him out she offers him tea. (Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures) By Stephanie Merry February 13 2014 Follow stephmerry When it comes to melodrama few actors deliver the goods like Colin Farrell with his melancholy eyebrows and flair for summoning big fat tears and Russell Crowe who bellows when hes not bloviating. The two are perfectly cast as adversaries in ""Winters Tale"" a shamelessly sentimental magical fable based on Mark Helprins 1983 novel. Farrell plays Peter Lake a puppy dog of a thief whos on the run from his former boss Pearly Soames (Crowe). Pearly is a shifty turn-of-the-century mob boss with a hair-trigger temper and a twitch that creates a sinister smile on his aggressively scarred face. Also he happens to be a demon. Pearly is infuriated that his protege wants to steal from people without killing them which doesnt mesh with the mafiosos business model. More troubling Peter has been seen flying around town on a winged white horse which smacks of miracles and other angelry. For demons a pegasus is cause for concern but nothing is more troublesome than true love. And wouldnt you know? Peter has fallen for Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay from ""Downton Abbey"") a 21-year-old heiress with wavy red locks and a beatific smile. She speaks in poetic verse and practically floats through her fathers mansion in a white nightgown but this angels fate is sealed Shes dying of consumption. In one of the movies most winning scenes the two meet while Peter is robbing the place. Rather than throw him out Beverly offers him tea. Its one of the few genuinely comedic scenes that lighten what could be a self-serious fairy tale. But everything falls apart when the time-traveling starts. The movie is broken into two parts. Most of it takes place in the early 1900s but another portion unfolds in the present day following an unaged and amnesiac Peter as he meets a woman (Jennifer Connelly) and her cancer-stricken daughter (Ripley Sobo). Less time and attention is paid to the modern part of the movie and a general atmosphere of schmaltz swallows up the carefully orchestrated mood of the Peter-and-Beverly love story. Up until that point theres a lot to like in ""Winters Tale."" Sure Crowe tends to growl or scream all of his lines and theres cheese aplenty. But the characters are memorable even the bit parts -- William Hurt as Beverlys no-nonsense father; Mckayla Twiggs as Beverlys precocious younger sister; and Kevin Corrigan as Pearlys dimwitted right-hand man. You dont see a lot of magic in dramas these days so it would be easy to write off a flying horse (or any other number of fantastical elements) as ridiculous. But much of the sorcery in ""Winters Tale"" is stunningly captured whether its Pearlys face cracking into pieces when he loses his temper or the way Beverly sees bright glints of light everywhere. And although there are missteps in the plotting Akiva Goldsman (who wrote ""A Beautiful Mind"" and adapted this screenplay) does good work directing his feature debut. ""Winters Tale"" is ambitious with its otherworldly ingredients and temporal leaps. Its not always a success but the movie has one thing going for it spot-on casting.   PG-13. At area theaters. Contains violence and some sensuality. 118 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Comments click to enlarge Winters Tale Video Rated PG-13  118 minutes  2014 This live-action fairy tale aims to recapture the romantic splendor MGMs golden era; the dialogue and metaphysical conceits are often risible but even they convey an emotionalism rare in 21st-century Hollywood. A good-natured thief (Colin Farrell) in 1916 New York falls in love with a consumptive heiress (Jessica Brown Findlay of Downton Abbey) while attempting to rob her fathers mansion; their romance upsets the thiefs employer (Russell Crowe doing his best Victor McLaglen impression) a centuries-old demon posing as an Irish crime boss. There are plenty more wacky developments where that came from such as flying horses and the premise that true love can lead to immortality; the filmmakers present these with surprising conviction and they seem almost natural given the movies lush graceful tone. Veteran producer Akiva Goldsman directed a script he adapted from Mark Helprins novel; with William Hurt and Eva Marie Saint.

"Winters Tale movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW Winters Tale  1/2 Winters Tale Warner Bros. Pictures Colin Farrell and Jessica Brown Findlay in ""Winters Tale."" Colin Farrell and Jessica Brown Findlay in ""Winters Tale."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In the movies particularly in the case of best-sellers adapted for the screen time travel and its next-door neighbor reincarnation seem like a good idea at the time. But very often something goes gooey. Even with Colin Farrells soulful eyes the tastefully cockamamie and increasingly gloppy new film ""Winters Tale"" pulled from Mark Helprins 1983 novel refuses to take off in any of its eras.Screenwriter/director Akiva Goldsman has stripped the source material for parts and for its through-line eliminating various characters as is the case with any adaptation. Whats left is sincere ridiculousness. You have the time-traveling thief with the heart of gold played by Farrell who begins life in late-19th-century New York City as a foundling straight out of Shakespeare. (As is the title minus the ""The."") You have a magical flying horse who befriends our hero Peter Lake at a convenient juncture just as hes about to be attacked by one of Lucifers own henchmen. The adversary with the penchant for computer-generated monsterisms is portrayed by Russell Crowe twitching and glowering and always always threatening to break into one of his songs from ""Les Miserables."" In the 1916 section of the tale Peter falls for a consumptive newspaper heiress (Jessica Brown Findlay of ""Downton Abbey"") who dies seconds after losing her virginity swathed in cinematographer Caleb Deschanels honey-toned lighting to the thief who stole her heart. In the 2014 bits also set in and around a highly romanticized New York Peters the same age the same desperate miracle worker in a new era. Jennifer Connelly playing a food writer but looking like someone who never eats enough has little to do except be sad and then be happy that this mysterious hunky angel of sorts has come to save her own little girl from cancer.If that sounds like a plot development of dubious taste ""Winters Tale"" may not be for you. Goldsman a veteran screenwriter makes his feature directorial debut here and he doesnt yet think like a visual fantasist. If your movie features prominently a flying steed with wings made of starlight you want that animal to look cool or at least interesting not like a hippy-dippy knockoff of the old TriStar studio logo. At one point Crowe who comes off like a ward boss with no concerns about re-election talks of ""blackenin souls and crushin miracles."" Despite the actors who at least get some swell clothes to wear ""Winters Tale"" is a bit of a soul-crusher itself.mjphillipstribune.com""Winters Tale"" - 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for violence and some sensuality)Running time 158Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Russell Crowe Colin Farrell Les Miserables (movie) Downton Abbey Latest movie reviews REVIEW About Last Night  1/2 REVIEW RoboCop  Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-winters-tale-review-20140213,0,7164293.column",200,winter'stale17,winter'stale,chicagotribune

Colin Farrell and Brown Findlay star in ""Winters Tale."" Photo David C. Lee Warner Bros. Winters Tale review A different type of tale but what? 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Winters Tale Drama. Starring Colin Farrell Russell Crowe and Jessica Brown Findlay. Directed by Akiva Goldsman. (PG-13. 118 minutes.) At the very least ""Winters Tale"" is something different. Its a romance with fantastic elements utterly lacking in cynicism heading straight for the grandest emotions and deepest issues in life - love death time - without anybody worrying that the audience wont buy it or worse start laughing. It is partly a failure but mostly it succeeds and the films aspiration is so enormous that thats enough for a moving experience. The films flaws will most probably be attributed to the story based on the novel by Mark Helprin about a thief who falls in love with an heiress dying of consumption in the New York City of 1916. But no the story is not to blame and neither is the screenplay by writer-director Akiva Goldsman nor the performances. No the fault here is with Goldsmans direction which is in many ways lovely but is uneven in one crucial particular. The movies one problem is that Goldsman seems unable to locate a balance point of harmony for all the storys disparate elements - fantasy fairy tale supernatural morality fable and saga of old New York. Its the directors job to fashion the specific universe in which a story can make perfect sense; and sometimes Goldsman just doesnt do that so that plot shifts seem jarring that should have been easily accepted. But then Goldsman a seasoned screenwriter (""A Beautiful Mind"") who has heretofore only directed a handful of TV show episodes has really bitten off a tough assignment for his first feature film. Related Stories Classic movie couples Relationship archetypes in film About Last Night review Low-stakes love story Endless Love review Tragic tale mangled for new generation Otherwise Goldsman does pretty well. He brings off an early key scene in which the thief Peter (Colin Farrell) - on the run from his demonic (literally) mob boss (Russell Crowe) - hits it off swimmingly with the young heiress Beverly (Jessica Brown Findlay) while in the course of robbing her house. Their almost instant spirit connection becomes believable because both in their different ways are desperate to stay alive and each sees the other as embodying lifes promise. Beverly is the storys great creation. Only 21 and living with a death sentence she claims that the sicker she gets the more she can see ""that everything is connected by light."" In a sense she is halfway between worlds still grounded in the physical but with her head already turned to the next place. This kind of ethereal carnality is always effective in movies at least with the right actress and newcomer Findlay is perfectly cast. She makes Farrells job easy. He just has to stay open and allow Peter to be a witness to radiance. This radiance becomes tangible in the films cinematography which makes the actors look like cut-glass figures sharp against the glowing backdrops. Even the night scenes glow with the blue-green light of a Hollywood moon and they convey the sense of magic in the midst of things. For two-thirds of its running time ""Winters Tale"" is like this and can do no wrong. And then in the last third things do go wrong with some tonal weirdness and story elements that are far-fetched or are allowed to feel that way. By holding his character together amid the shifts and turns Farrell holds the emotional thread together - which is to say he holds the movie together. Though a crook Peter is a character of complete purity and honesty and its a pleasure to watch how Farrell plays that whether in the movies sole love scene - the most beautiful so far of 2014 - or in his dialogues with other actors. Whether speaking to a child or to William Hurt as the sick girls father or to Eva Marie Saint as an old friend from days past you can see Farrell striving sometimes pausing to say the truest thing in the simplest way. These are virtues too strong to discount and they easily make up for some of the last thirds awkwardness. Besides ""Winters Tale"" has a magic white horse and these days you just cant see enough of those. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

An unsupernatural romance. Director Akiva Goldsman (158). PG-13 Violence mild sexuality. Area theaters. There was a time nearly 15 years ago when Colin Farrell was being groomed as an A-list leading man. Instead fate -- or bad choices or perhaps some sort of internal rebellion -- turned him into a character actor instead. Farrell is undeniably talented. And when he sticks to the pitch-black humor of independent films like ""In Bruges"" hes fantastic. But when he tries to squeeze himself into traditional Hollywood material he too often flails. Which brings us to the dreadful ""Winters Tale."" Mark Helprins original novel had its well-earned fans but writer-director Akiva Goldsman replaces Helprins creative metaphysical musings with cheap sentimentality. Colin Farrell and Jessica Brown Findlay in ""Winters Tale"" directed by Akiva Goldsman (David C. Lee) Farrell should never have accepted this role but worse he shouldnt even have been offered it. Hes at least a decade too old to believably play Peter Lake an orphan who works for master thief Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe) in turn-of-the-century New York. When Peter decides to go his own way he makes an enemy out of Pearly. And its worse than he thinks though Peter doesnt know it his city is crowded with angels and demons -- Pearly among the latter. Nothing burns him up more than angel-assisted miracles and Peter is about to find one in 20-year-old Beverly (Jessica Brown Findlay). A beautiful innocent shielded by her protective father (William Hurt) Beverly happens to be dying of consumption. Before she goes theres just enough time for her and Peter to fall madly in love. This drives Pearly crazy and he tries his best to ruin both of them even appealing to the Devil (Will Smith in a cameo) himself. Jennifer Connelly and Colin Farrell in ""Winters Tale"" (David C. Lee) Goldsman streamlines Helprins 1983 book but seems oddly to assume viewers have read it. He makes little effort to explain this magical world or its rules and relies on fragile virgins and sick children rather than insights and emotions to pull our heartstrings. The ponderous dialogue feels equally false with characters conversing primarily in lofty pronouncements. A time-travel mystery involving Jennifer Connelly is jammed in ineffectually but Crowe at least has some fun chewing scenery as the evil villain with a delicious bloodlust. And thanks to the angelic lights glinting everywhere the scenery is it must be said very pretty. Russell Crowe as Pearly Soames in ""Winters Tale"" (David C. Lee) But Goldsman a prolific screenwriter (""A Beautiful Mind ""I Am Legend"") making his directorial debut overplays every moment of spiritual yearning. The whole movie hinges on the allegedly miraculous romance between Beverly and Peter but Goldsmans leads are distractingly mismatched and lack even a spark of chemistry. Peter is told that ""destiny calls to each of us"" but its Farrell who should be listening. Surely an actor of his gifts is called to finer things.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A moony kitsch fantasy of the ""everything is connected and everyone is special"" variety Winters Tale is as romantic as a Facebook-posted engagement photo as opulent as a rehearsal dinner and as profound as a greeting card. Its characters play Brahms fly over New York City on a magic white horse and babble endlessly about stars miracles and how stars are in and of themselves miracles. Digitally added twinkles sparkles and lens flares abound and the movies end credits resemble a wedding photographers slideshow sepia stills of Colin Farrell and Jessica Brown Findlay kissing and laughing on horseback overlaid with serif-font text while Hans Zimmers love theme--which features passages lifted from ""The Star-Spangled Banner""--plays on. Though viewers may have trouble watching any of this with a straight face the movies goofy corniness becomes marginally endearing in a hobbling-puppy sort of way.  Adapted by A-list cornball Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind Batman amp; Robin The Da Vinci Code) from Mark Helprins 1983 novel Winters Tale stars Farrell as Peter Lake a Russian-born New Jersey-raised burglar whose thick Irish brogue is neither acknowledged nor explained. Set mostly in 1916 the movie follows Peter as he falls in love with privileged red-haired Beverly (Findlay) and battles the citys head demon Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe also doing an Irish accent) with the help of the aforementioned horse. Peter and Beverlys romance is notional; it registers as neither a real love nor a real tragedy and instead exists largely as a way for the narrative to introduce and explore its convoluted cosmology which involves magical gemstones automatic drawing love-induced immortality miracle quotas guardian angels (who seem to work exclusively in the service industry) and the complicated demon hierarchy overseen by Lucifer (Will Smith wearing earrings as thick as thumbs and a Jimi Hendrix T-shirt).For a movie so busy with matters both supernatural and sentimental (it contains not one or two but three tragically dying characters--two with tuberculosis and one with cancer) Winters Tale is remarkably bare-looking set on suspiciously empty New York streets and in noticeably underdecorated interiors. The ""whatever was in the wardrobe department"" costuming and mid-range effects combined with the storys haphazardly introduced fantasy metaphysical elements and use of a non-supernatural present-day observer (Jennifer Connelly) lend the movie the atmosphere of a lackluster Doctor Who Christmas special.In certain ways all of this resembles a less successful cousin to The Adjustment Bureau George Nolfis similarly silly Doctor Who-esque romantic fantasy. But whereas that movie boasted a charismatic credible central couple and a sense of loose fun Winters Tale has only its hokey metaphysical worldview and its vast array of maudlin cliches. Its not by any metric a good movie and yet by the umpteenth green screen shot of Farrell smiling like a maniac while he flies through the sky on his magical horse one cant help rooting for it. A film this awkwardly sappy comes only once in a blue moon.

Because depending on your answer you may find yourself either stifling a sniffle by the films end credits or rolling your eyes and groaning. There isnt much middle ground. Based on Mark Helprins beloved 1983 novel and adapted with a liberal dollop of sap by Oscar-winning screenwriter-turned-director Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind) Winters Tale never figures out what kind of story it wants to tell. Is it a three-hankie tearjerker about the redemptive power of love? Is it a dark sci-fi thriller pitting the age-old forces of heaven and hell against each other? Or is it a kid-friendly fairy tale replete with a dashing Prince Charming astride a flying white stallion? Miraculously and unfortunately the answer is all of the above. After a sepia-tinted prologue set in 1895 -- when a baby boy is placed on a raft and pushed Moses-like toward Manhattan by his immigrant parents who are denied entry to America -- the film flashes forward to 1916. There the boy now named Peter Lake and played as a grown-up by the seemingly ageless Colin Farrell is a quick-witted thief on the run from his sadistic boss Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe with a mouth-to-ear scar and an ill-advised growly leprechaun brogue). With the help of that mystical white steed Peter escapes from Pearly and his bowler-hatted goons long enough to break into the mansion of a newspaper magnate (William Hurt) where he meets the mans dying tubercular daughter (Downton Abbeys Lady Sybil Jessica Brown Findlay) and falls deeply madly hopelessly in love. Apart from the obvious question of why directors are so fond of killing off Brown Findlay the film asks Can Peters passion miraculously save the auburn-haired beauty from her cruel death sentence? And if not in this lifetime then what about the next? If it sounds like Im being intentionally vague about the films cornball Snow White-meets-Boardwalk Empire plot thats because its fantastical twists decades-spanning time leaps and head-scratching cameos (hey there Will Smith) will be a big chunk of its allure for the hopeless romantics in the house. Me I was never able to go with it. Which is a shame. Considering his heady pop scripts for The DaVinci Code and Angels amp; Demons Goldsman clearly understands how to grapple with ethereal topics like destiny and miracles. But here he seems to be stringing together one preposterously hokey scenario after another. His wisest move was casting Farrell who much as he did in Saving Mr. Banks knows how to put aside his cynicism and sell sentimental material with conviction. Its no coincidence that Winters Tale is being released on Valentines Day when our resistance to schmaltz is at its weakest. But do that special someone in your life a favor and splurge on some flowers and a nice heart-shaped Russell Stover box instead.

Daily Edition Login to download Winters Tale Film Review 900 PM PST 2/11/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS An ineffectual account of an eternal love. TWITTER Colin Farrell and ""Downton Abbey"" alum Jessica Brown Findlay star as lovers in Akiva Goldsmans directorial debut an adaptation of Mark Helprins 1983 novel. Aspiring transcendent love stories dont come much more claptrappy and unconvincing than Winters Tale. In a yarn spanning more than a century people die (or then again maybe they dont) vendettas never end a white Pegasus is always there to save the day any trace of humor is banished and Will Smith suddenly sprouts dagger-sharp teeth at the climax of his worst-ever big-screen appearance. The Valentines Day release date is predicated on the idea that such a soapy tale will make for a good date movie so Warner Bros. will have to hope that love story-seeking young women will be able to convince their dates that this one will be OK because Colin Farrell and Russell Crowe are in it. Theyd do much better with The Lego Movie. Mark Helprins nearly 800-page 1983 novel has a substantial literary reputation but whats been hatched by Akiva Goldsman a veteran screenwriter making his directorial debut would make you think that the original story here was cooked up by Nicholas Sparks. Goldman is fortunate in his friends having gotten his A Beautiful Mind co-stars Crowe and Jennifer Connelly to come aboard and having induced Smith with whom he worked on I Robot Hancock and I Am Legend to do his ill-advised extended cameo. VIDEO Winters Tale Trailer Colin Farrell Stars in Time-Jumping Romantic Drama Connections like this can help get your film made but they dont necessarily make it palatable. Neither does such a solemn sanctimonious approach to material that is far-fetched by any standard. Rather than giving it a wink and a nod thus inviting the viewer to become complicit in his romantic flight of fancy and fantasy Goldsman lays on the blowsy sincerity while lacing the film with impenetrably air-headed narration about how ""everything is connected by light"" (in a British accent for added gravitas) and investing in a hero who can ask with a straight face ""Is it possible to love someone so much they cant die?"" A couple of generations ago in Love Story the answer was no. In fact with external appointments changed the first section of Winters Tale actually is Love Story Lower-class boy and upper-class girl fall in love utter banal platitudes she dies. Then 98 years later hes still around still in his 30s and mooning about her and still being pursued by his diabolical former mentor who cant forgive a slight. STORY Warner Bros. Sets Release Date for Winters Tale No doubt intended as an emotionalized and commercialized embodiment of Nietzsches ""eternal recurrence"" the time-jumping setup is so lacking in plausible narrative underpinnings that Goldsman would have needed to somehow seduce the audience into accepting the wild leaps the story takes. Without the needed persuasion the strong temptation is just to reject the entire premise early on which makes for a lot of eye-rolling exasperated sighing and wristwatch glancing during the remaining long haul. At the outset in 1895 a baby is surreptitiously set adrift on a toy boat called City of Justice into New York Harbor by immigrant parents forced to return to Europe. Two decades later baby-turned-professional thief Peter Lake (Colin Farrell) is cornered by a very angry man with terrible scars across the left side of his face Pearly Soames (Crowe) the ringleader of Brooklyns Short Tails gang. Pearly having trained the lad would rather kill him than let him go his own way and he nearly does before Peter finds a horse that spirits him off and out of Pearlys clutches. Its symptomatic of Peters lack of wit that all through the years hes never able to come up with another name for this helpful animal other than ""Horse."" However he is able to recognize a good thing when he sees one which he does when while attempting to rob a Manhattan mansion one night he finds within it its greatest treasure Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay aka Lady Sybil Crawley in Downton Abbey) the beautiful red-headed daughter of one of New Yorks richest men (William Hurt). For the next hour or so a photogenic but bland romance progresses as the love-struck Peter tends to the 21-year-old while she slowly dies of consumption. Periodically Peter must ward off attacks by the relentless Pearly who at one point visits an underground hideout to ask a favor of the so-called ""Judge"" (Smith) a Lucifer-like figure who rants at his underling before baring teeth that go pointy like a werewolfs. After much cavorting swooning and expressions of eternal devotion in a variety of scenic settings Peter willingly obliges Beverlys final request the experience of physical love before she expires. Pearly then tosses Peter off the Brooklyn Bridge. Flash forward to 2014 theres Peter now a long-haired and bearded chap creating chalk drawings in Central Park. Not knowing his name nor where he is he nonetheless befriends Virginia (Connelly) and her little daughter Abby (Ripley Sobo). They begin to connect some dots the also-still-extant Pearly persists in his pursuit of Peter ""Horse"" is still alive and flying and miracles are expected. As the presumed star-crossed climax approaches one is struck by the exceptional opulence of the New York settings (particularly the vintage ones) overseen and/or created by production designer Naomi Shohan and visual effects supervisor Richard Hollander the great care devoted to the changing backdrops and skylines dictated by the eras and the beauty with which it has all been photographed by Caleb Deschanel. This is one movie that was definitely not shot in Louisiana. Unfortunately the great settings lack vital and compelling characters to place within them. Farrell has to work harder than anyone and hes nothing if not energetic but the burden of the premise falls harder on him than on anyone else. Crowe is one tough dude here in a character who is malevolence and nothing but. Pearly would seem to outweigh Peter by at least 75 pounds making a major brawl between them as far-fetched as just about everything else in this unbelievable tale.

"Review Winters Tale 2.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Article Review Winters Tale 2.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Feb 12 2014 1202 PM Earnest in its ambition but dopey in its execution ""Winters Tale"" never takes flight. Unlike the white horse who shows up from time to time. Sure this is a fantasy romance but it cant be a good sign that the audience laughed out loud whenever the beast appeared. But we digress. Akiva Goldsmans film based on Mark Helprins novel has other more earthly problems. It stars Colin Farrell as Peter Lake. He arrives in New York at Ellis Island as an infant in 1895. His parents are denied entry but they set little Peter adrift on a model boat. He grows up in Manhattan as a talented charming thief taken under the wing so to speak of the evil mobster Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe). Like really evil. Demon evil. Face turns into a ""Buffy""-style-vampire-visage-when-hes-mad evil. And boy is he mad. Peter has deserted him and Pearly wants him dead and he almost gets his wish early on. But Peter is saved by the horse which is actually a dog or something and with the animals goading winds up robbing the palatial home of Isaac Penn (William Hurt). The only one home is Penns daughter Beverly (Jessica Brown Findlay) who when she catches Peter after he breaks in falls for him immediately. The feeling is mutual. Sadly shes dying of consumption but she maintains a chipper attitude toward life and love saying things like how the sicker she gets the clearer she can see that everything is connected by light. Cue the CGI light effects. (And the gag reflex). This is one of those loves that will outlast time. But not if Pearly can help it. One of the major goals of his existence is to deny people their miracles and hes evidently pretty good at it seeing as how he can be granted an audience with Lucifer himself (an unbilled cameo thats too fun to spoil). Events conspire to land Peter in the present where he runs (literally) into a little girl (Mckayla Twiggs) and befriends her mother Virginia (Jennifer Connelly). Ah but the girl is dying of cancer. And Peter hasnt aged a day unlike Willa (Eva Marie Saint) Beverlys younger sister. Shes now the editor of the newspaper where Virginia works conveniently fitting in with some of the themes everything is connected and everything happens for a reason. There is more magic and more miracles to come along with more mayhem courtesy of Pearly. But ""magic"" is pretty subjective in this case. The film is unapologetically romantic. Its no coincidence that it opens on Valentines Day. It wants to make you cry and snuggle with the person youre sitting next to while youre at it (assuming you arrived together). The cast is immensely talented and the cinematography (courtesy of Caleb Deschanel) is gorgeous especially whenever it snows which is often. But it too often seems as if everyone is stuck in a big stew of romantic goo. Not having read the novel its difficult to say if some essential connective tissue is missing from the story line (Goldsman also wrote the script) -- despite the best efforts of everyone involved ""Winters Tale"" is at times hard to follow. And maybe we are just supposed to follow our hearts. But our heads keep saying this just isnt working. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Winters Tale Review Colin Farrell Stars in a Ridiculous Romantic Drama | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Winters Tale Justin Chang Chief Film Critic JustinCChang 16 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr February 11 2014 | 0900PM PT Akiva Goldsmans feature-directing debut is a cloying sledgehammer-subtle adaptation of Mark Helprins vastly richer novel. Angels and demons. A man who doesnt age. A snow-white pegasus. Colin Farrells hair. In every respect ""Winters Tale"" is a movie rife with mysterious and unexplainable phenomena -- elusive supernatural occurrences that its characters insist on describing as miracles. But the real miracle will be if audiences manage to suppress their giggles during this enormously cloying sledgehammer-subtle feature directing debut by longtime writer-producer Akiva Goldsman whittled down from Mark Helprins vastly richer century-spanning novel of the same title. Agreeably daft at times but more often painfully trite in its attempts to impose some grand narrative design on the story of two grievously ill young women and the man who may hold the key to their salvation Warner Bros. Valentines Day release could nonetheless seduce viewers willing to go along with its offbeat romantic-fantasy elements provided they dont wander in expecting Shakespeare. ""Magic is everywhere around us"" a female voiceover whispers over the opening scenes. ""You just have to look."" As if to prove its point the film proceeds from a brazenly illogical premise opening in present-day New York with a man moving through the upper rafters of Grand Central Terminal. He may be played by Colin Farrell but hes a lot older than he looks as becomes clear (sort of) during an extended flashback to 1895 when he was just an infant arriving at Ellis Island with his immigrant parents. Mom and Dad are deported due to illness but not before they succeed in setting the child adrift near shore like Moses among the reeds abandoning him to a lonely Lower Manhattan upbringing. ""We are all connected"" the voiceover continues helpfully. ""Each baby born carries a miracle inside."" This baby more than most for he will grow up to be the strapping handsome Peter Lake (Farrell) a wily thief and professional charmer who when we catch up with him in 1916 has run afoul of crime boss Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe). Pearly it turns out is no ordinary crook but rather an ill-tempered demon quite literally hellbent on destroying Peter before he can fulfill his miraculous destiny. That destiny is somehow entangled with the fate of Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay) a lovely consumption-ridden pianist who is charmed rather than creeped out beyond belief when she catches Peter burglarizing her fathers Central Park estate. ""The sicker I become the more I can see that everything is connected by light"" Beverly coughs -- spelling out for the benefit of anyone not paying attention that ""Winters Tale"" means to concern itself with the deepest mysteries of human existence. In a world where morality is governed by some strict combination of karmic laws and screenwriting manuals a star appearing in the heavens means an angel has received his wings (Clarence is that you?) and a magnificent flying horse named Athansor periodically swoops down out of the heavens to snatch Peter away from Pearlys infernal clutches. According to this great cosmic blueprint nothing happens by coincidence and love is a force that can defeat death itself -- as becomes apparent when Peter having given himself body and soul to the dying Beverly is suddenly whisked forward in time to the year 2014 where his divine purpose will be revealed. Goldsman who dealt with twinkly visions of an ostensibly more concrete nature in his Oscar-winning screenplay for ""A Beautiful Mind"" doesnt exactly shy away from the overweening grandiosity of his material. That extravagance was built right into Helprins massive (and massively successful) 1983 novel a dazzlingly ambitious epic set in a fairy-tale New York replete with magical-realist inventions pre-millennial portents and richly Dickensian characters -- most of which unfortunately have been left by the wayside during the sagas reductive journey to the bigscreen. In ""distilling from it what resonated with me the most"" per press notes Goldsman appears to have plucked key moments and images from the book and twisted them into a familiar iconography of spiritual/sentimental kitsch -- hey look a little girl with cancer -- with no regard for the delicacy with which Helprin eased the reader into his fanciful universe. The best miracles are those that creep up on you unexpectedly rather than endlessly announcing themselves and the ones in ""Winters Tale"" are fatally obvious and self-congratulatory; its the sort of film that insists on taking you by the hand and steering you through a dark labyrinth for two hours instructing you to watch your step every five minutes only to switch on the lights and reveal youve been in a circular room with an exit in plain sight. As an adapter Goldsman is out of his depth. As a director he is at least fortunate in his choice of actors including Farrell watchable enough to prevail past what appears to be a birds nest atop a buzz cut; Findlay as luminous and intelligent a presence as she was in ""Downton Abbey""; Jennifer Connelly as the somber mother of the aforementioned little girl with cancer (Ripley Sobo); and the always welcome Eva Marie Saint making her first screen appearance in the eight years since ""Superman Returns."" Appealing as these performers are they all seem to be emoting in a sort of fog as though too busy trying to parse the storys metaphysics to connect with each other onscreen. Certainly none of them seems to be working as strenuously as Crowe who previously collaborated with Goldsman on ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Cinderella Man""; adopting a facial scar and a rough Irish brogue he hulks and growls his way through the picture like Mad Dog Coll with a bad head cold. Its one of the more joyless performances of the actors career and Pearlys sudden blasts of CG-augmented rage seem to belong to another film entirely. Ditto the ""Screwtape Letters""-style dialogues he carries on with his master Lucifer himself played in an unbilled cameo by a grizzled Will Smith (hes the Fresh Prince of Hell Air). Production designer Naomi Shohan achieves a vivid enough approximation of turn-of-the-century New York in the films first half making resourceful use of historic sites in each of the five boroughs -- from Brooklyns cobblestone-paved streets and Queens Calvary Cemetery to the docks of South Street Seaport and Surrogates Courthouse in Lower Manhattan. This is hardly the grand teeming vision of the city set forth in Helprins novel. But as shot in moody muted tones by Caleb Deschanel it does make a suitably romantic snow-dappled backdrop for a picture that attempts to merge the swooning passion of ""Somewhere in Time"" with the cozy uplift of ""Touched by an Angel"" -- a subgenre in which the natural and the supernatural are invisibly and for the most part benevolently intertwined. ""What if we are all part of a great pattern that we may one day understand?"" that voiceover pipes up again near films end. Its a nice enough thought and it may well leave the charitable viewer with a peculiar form of consolation Rest assured your efforts will bear fruit. Suffering today means rejoicing tomorrow. The next movie will be a better one. Film Review Winters TaleReviewed at Warner Bros. Studios Feb. 5 2014. MPAA Rating PG-13. Running time 118 MIN.

Calipas says May 8 2015 at 425 pm I thought it was a great innocent and sweet movie; a break from the nauseous formula big budget junk. Justin Chang you are WAY off base here. This film touches upon the humanity and wonder that is rarely broached anymore; it is at once about love and life...and dreams. The problem with this review and reviewers like Chang is that they wreak of the modern age of a cold antiseptic reality which in many ways dehumanizes and desensitizes us from the finer traits within. Go within Its where all the magic is. Hail to WINTERS TALE - a wonderful movie and source of escapism. And Jessica Brown Findlay is amazing. Reply Sheila says January 8 2015 at 706 pm my daughter and I loved the movie. It was sweet and poignant. Reply audrey says December 12 2014 at 1213 pm I saw the movie and I loved it. the casting the music the setting and the love William Hurt and Collin Farrell project is felt to the viewers I fell in love with all the actors the love that isnt around any more the movie took my heart the girl who plays Beverly Penn is perfect . I watch it over and over to shayyyy Reply curious says February 15 2014 at 231 pm I saw the movie and its not as terrible as this guy says. wondering what he has against the director Reply MaryAnn says February 16 2014 at 235 pm I agree with what Curious wrote-the review is overly harsh. Reply LOL says February 12 2014 at 113 pm Does it have an ""Exit pursued by a bear""? (Americans will be scratching their uncultured heads at that reference.) Reply dar dar says February 17 2014 at 1200 pm Uncultured Americans? Surely you jest - probably some sniveling Eastern Euro rat troll Reply mentos says February 13 2014 at 1250 pm Yeah and ""Exit pursued by a bear"" is the ""You had me at hello"" of Shakespeare references. Its like saying your love of ""Mambo No. 5"" makes you the expert on World Music. Go culture your head in a tub of yogurt presumed Frenchy. Reply chickofprey says February 15 2014 at 353 pm ^this made me love you Jeeves says February 12 2014 at 258 pm Quite speaking down on Americans in a comment section shows who has culture. Reply Ken says February 12 2014 at 1143 am This one wins The Pauline Kael Award for most entertaining movie review Ive read so far this year. Reply Blythe says February 12 2014 at 335 am ""hes the Fresh Prince of Hell Air""... HA Reply Van says February 11 2014 at 1013 pm At least the movie is earnest hopeful and with good intention. You call this ""ridiculous"" movie ""enormously cloying"" ""painfully trite"" and ""self-congratulatory"" which is exactly how this review comes across as. Reply K. Wright (kellypea56) says February 15 2014 at 102 pm Well said. The reviewer was emoting such a fog I was unable to finish reading and looked to exit instead. Reply Ana Rodriguez says February 11 2014 at 1005 pm Ripley Sobo is the little girl with cancer not Mckayla. Ripley is also starring at Matilda on Broadway.

I suspect ""Winters Tale"" which defies logic in new and exciting ways as it pushes together lovers played by Colin Farrell and Jessica Brown Findlay (""Downton Abbey"") will engender a similar minority of dedicated swooning admirers. For the rest of us piffle this is and piffle it will always be. The sparks between Farrell and Brown Findlay are undeniable but ""Winters Tale"" gives us too little of their love story opting instead to lose itself in magical mumbo-jumbo while at the same time trying to keep one foot in the real recognizable world. In 1895 two Russian immigrants (played by Matt Bomer and Lucy Griffiths) are turned away from Ellis Island because of the husbands respiratory ailments. Determined to make a better life for their son they put the child in a model ship lower him in the Atlantic and send him toward the shore. Jump ahead to 1916 where that baby has grown up to become Peter Lake (Farrell 38) -- and if you think a foundling and a 21-year-old Colin Farrell is a lot to digest in the first five minutes strap yourself in. The first time we see Lake hes running away from the henchmen of crime boss Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe) who had been Lakes mentor. Lake gets away naturally by hopping onto a white horse that can fly. See video Russell Crowe Really Hates Colin Farrell in Winters Tale Trailer (Video) Being rescued by the Tri-Star logo gets the ball rolling on a plot that includes miracles Satan terminal illness demon gangs of New York ballroom dancing and a 107-year-old female editor-in-chief of a major Manhattan newspaper. Adapting the novel by Mark Helprin writer-director Akiva Goldsman (whose range of bad screenplays covers everything from ""Batman amp; Robin"" to the Oscar-winning ""A Beautiful Mind"") keeps throwing fate and destiny and magical realism at the screen but he doesnt strike that delicate balance in which the audience chooses to just accept everything and go along for the ride. Also read Akiva Goldsmans Winters Tale to Open on Valentines Day Where ""Winters Tale"" achieves the spark it so desperately chases is when it slows down enough for Farrell to pitch woo at Findlay Browns beautiful doomed heiress. Stricken with consumption she runs a constant fever and must keep the windows open so that the wintry air can keep her cool. Anyone who mourns the loss of Lady Sybil on ""Downton Abbey"" knows that this actress has a gift for falling in love with working-class Irishmen and those talents are in full effect here. The film grinds its gears when it tries to make its fantasy elements run alongside real-world logic Will we buy that Peter Lake can live for a century without aging so that he can fulfill his destiny? Sure why not. But the moment the film trots out Eva Marie Saint (still radiant after all these years) as a centenarian whos still running the family business thats just too many tonal plates to spin. Also read Trio of 80s Hit Movie Remakes Put Valentines Day Box Office in Time Warp It also doesnt help that we reach a point where its apparent that ""Winters Tale"" is about to spend a great deal of time tying up its least interesting storyline in which the nefarious Soames must stop Lake from doing humanity a solid. When ""Winters Tale"" makes its way onto formats that let you watch the Farrell/Findlay Brown scenes enjoy their romance. In the meantime its not worth listening to the rest of the love song just to get to the hooks. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Because we like you.Photo by David C. Lee - (c) 2012 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. Its a little sad that Colin Farrell has outgrown roles that require him to wear raggedy sweaters and say things like ""For fooks sake"" It had to happen though. Farrell has always made a terrific bad boy but he clearly knows he couldnt be a scamp forever and he seems to be settling into some very serious responsible-adult roles. Last year he played a doting if heavy-drinking father in Saving Mr. Banks. Now in Akiva Goldsmans Winters Tale based on Mark Helprins bestselling novel set in a mythical version of early 20th-century Manhattan he plays Peter Lake a petty criminal who tries to go straight much to the dismay of the demonic supranaturally gifted crime boss Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe) who raised him from boyhood. As it turns out Peter has some fookin extraordinary powers himself though he wont find out what they are until well into the following century. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - If you havent guessed already -- and if you havent read Helprins book -- you should know that Winters Tale is laced heavily with magical woo-woo. If youre a reasonably rational human being you may snort at the way Peters consumptive love interest Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay) exclaims to her newspaper-publisher father (William Hurt) ""The sicker I become the more clearly I can see that everything is connected by light"" as beams of CG radiance glint around her. But provided you know what youre in for the first chunk of Winters Tale -- the romantic part before Peter is consigned to being a boring old Jesus figure -- offers some modest escapist pleasures not least thanks to Farrells sweet earnest intensity and the presence of a rather spectacular flying white horse.Because if having a horse in a movie is almost always a good idea having a flying white horse ridden by Colin Farrell is pretty much the ne plus ultra. Farrell is an extraordinarily appealing actor a five-o-clock-shadow charmer. But even with those mad Groucho Marx eyebrows -- like two fat black caterpillars meeting on a leaf and saying ""How dyou do?"" -- and his (now diminished) party boy reputation on film Farrell has always come off as a contemplative fellow one who carries worry with him wherever he goes. The role of Peter Lake requires him to be a shy sexy heartthrob in the movies first half and a savior in the second -- he pulls it off as well as anyone could. And his first meeting with that white horse is more pleasingly earthbound than cartoonishly fantastical. Approaching this lovely creature with its inquisitive eyes and fine silver-gray forelock he shows the humility of a stable boy and a sense of wonder at its otherworldly beauty. Horse and rider are a match -- as you would expect theres a spiritual connection -- though later Jack will appear shirtless with the feverish heiress Beverly which is a different sort of magic altogether.Film Details Winters Tale RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time118 min. More Info Trailer Unfortunately it all goes south when Jennifer Connelly shows up as a modern-day newspaper columnist and super-worried mom. Thats not Connellys fault; shes a fine luminous actress. But thats when Winters Tale switches from a lavish mystical fantasy into a ponderous fable about destiny and miracles and stuff. Goldsman has written heaps of screenplays and the list of movies hes produced is even longer but Winters Tale is his feature directing debut -- he hits all the beats which often makes the proceedings feel perfunctory and in the clinch he overreaches for pathos. Still he keeps the story moving smoothly enough. And the picture has a rich handsome look courtesy of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel. Even though the super-magical stuff is highly infused with CGI Deschanel blends it seamlessly with brick-and-mortar reality.Some of Winters Tale is just flat-out pretty enough to work. Beverly and her family own a glorious fairy-tale mansion perched at the edge of a frozen lake -- the scene is winter wonderland central a confection of dazzling sparkly whiteness. And while you wouldnt call his performance believable or realistic Crowe seems to be having a grand old time as a glowering villain. How often does he get to play the kind of guy who consults -- and takes seriously -- a bunch of enchanted glowing gems or who has to bow and scrape when he meets with one of Beelzebubs loyal servants (played by Will Smith)? Winters Tale however imperfectis that rare beast on the movie landscape an unapologetic romance (for the first two-thirds anyway) with attractive stars and special effects designed to give audiences something other than the experience of watching worlds get blown up. And even when he isnt flying the horse is still pretty magnificent. You dont have to dress up nature that much to get close to magic.
