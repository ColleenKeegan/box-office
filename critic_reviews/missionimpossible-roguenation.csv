Powered by WordPress.com VIP Sponsored Content Entertainment Movie Reviews 07/30/2015 1100am Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation Tom Cruise thriller keeps topping itself Richard Roeper richardroeper | email With ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" were getting the best Bond movie since ""Casino Royale"" in 2006. OK so Ethan Hunt isnt James Bond and the Impossible Missions Force isnt MI6 but the ""MI"" films are essentially Bond movies with a touch of ""Bourne"" and a whole lot of Tom Cruise doing what he does best -- looking about 15 years younger than his true age (Cruise recently turned 53) performing harrowing stunts engaging in clever banter with his adversaries and doing it all with just the hint of a smirk that tells us even when it appears certain Mr. Hunt is facing imminent death hell find a way to free himself from the clutches of even the most dastardly sneering villain. Because hes Hunt. Ethan Hunt. Believe it or not its been 19 years since the first ""Mission Impossible"" a high-powered mess directed by Brian DePalma. With the fifth installment of the franchise writer-director Christopher McQuarrie matches the style and edge of ""Mission Impossible III"" (2006) directed by J.J. Abrams and Brad Birds ""Ghost Protocol"" (2011.) This is the rare instance of the later movies in a series easily exceeding the quality of the original. In ""Rogue Nation"" we get the classic spy-out-in-the-cold scenario. The great Alec Baldwin hams it up nicely as Hunley the gruff and fantastically clueless head of the CIA who forces the IMF out of existence because thats what gruff and clueless government bureaucrats do in movies like this They refuse to listen to logic and disregard the facts because they dont care for these hotshot rogue types who dont follow protocol. RELATED Tom Cruise loves roaming globe making Mission Impossible films Just because IMF has been disbanded doesnt mean Hunt will relent in his pursuit of ""The Syndicate"" a mysterious (and some say purely mythical) organization of former good-guy operatives now working in the shadows to spread evil and blow things up and kidnap world leaders and BRING THE WORLD TO ITS KNEES BAHAHAHAHAHA Rebecca Ferguson does stellar work as the beautiful and deadly and alluring Ilsa Faust an agent who also might be a double agent and could even be a double-DOUBLE agent. Ilsa and Ethan exchange smoldering glances even as Ethan is trying to decipher whether shes trying to kill him or save his life but theres no time for romance in ""Rogue Nation"" not with so much intrigue and suspense lurking around every corner. Much has been made of Cruise doing his own stunt work in an amazing sequence in which Ethan clings to the side of a Russian cargo plane as it takes off from a Minsk runway and it IS a fantastically ludicrous sequence -- but its not even the second best action set piece in ""Rogue Nation."" Director McQuarrie stages a beautifully shot extended scene in the Vienna State Opera house in which Ethan must outwit outlast and out-shoot multiple potential assassins. Its reminiscent of Hitchcock -- or the aforementioned de Palma when the latter was doing his best Hitchcock impersonation. Just breathtaking thrilling action cinema. Later Ethan and Ilsa team up to breach a seemingly impenetrable fortress that includes a secure underwater tank. They need to do this because they have to switch a code so Ethans sidekick Benji (Simon Pegg excellent comic relief) can access a facility in order to you know thwart the bad guys. At times the deception and the intrigue and the twists and turns make it nearly impossible follow every detail of the plot but even when things get muddled we know Ethans our hero and we know well eventually learn the true intentions of Ilsa and the rest of the players. One relatively weak spot Sean Harris Solomon Lane isnt a particularly memorable villain. Hes medium-insane and he loves to taunt Ethan but he looks about as frightening as your accountant after a long weekend. Its an interesting move to go with such a meek-looking bad guy but I just dont find Lane all that chilling or memorable. Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames turn in fine performances as Ethans fiercely loyal teammates. Simon McBurney is absolutely brilliant as a British Intelligence official with questionable motives. Of course this is Cruises movie Cruises franchise -- and Ethan Hunt has become one of the signature characters of his 35-year career. [s3r star=3.5/4] Paramount Pictures presents a film written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Running time 131 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for sequences of action and violence and brief partial nudity).

Entertainment ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" Shouldnt Be Nearly As Good As It Is The latest installment in Tom Cruises spy franchise manages to be ridiculous amounts of fun despite itself. And here are four reasons why. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic Its old. View this image > Bo Bridges / Paramount Pictures ID 6441218 The Mission Impossible movies have now been around for just under two decades almost twice as long as the television show on which theyre based (and thats counting the 80s revival). The first film came out in 1996 when Cruise was 33 and his co-star was the owl-eyed French actress Emmanuelle Beart making a doomed bid for American stardom. It was directed by no less than Brian De Palma (of Scarface and Carrie) and co-written by Chinatowns Oscar-winning Robert Towne who also scripted the John Woo-helmed sequel. Film series have certainly chugged on for longer -- see Alien Star Wars Planet of the Apes -- but its rare for one this long in the tooth to also be so continuous. Ethan Hunt the indestructible IMF agent extraordinaire played by Cruise has never passed the torch off to someone else even as his team has shifted around him. Five features in the franchise could easily feel past its prime. But through the same blockbuster thaumaturgy thats allowed the Fast amp; Furious films to scale up into operatic chrome-crunching weepies Mission Impossible has somehow adapted and gotten better over time. Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation may not be the best in the series (a win Id give to 2011s Ghost Protocol) but it easily tops that first movie which despite its pedigree and box office success was a mixed bag. The franchise has gradually refined its combination of jaw-dropping action set pieces and sleekly cool world of espionage into something thats approaching pop perfection. And in a moment in which studio movies have fallen hard for serialization -- even the latest string of Bond films are linked -- Mission Impossibles weightlessness both in its stunts and in its spirit is its greatest asset. ID 6434187 It stars Tom Cruise. View this image > David James / Paramount Pictures ID 6441227 And Cruises career has gone through some roller coaster swings over the course of the franchise. Cruise was still married to Nicole Kidman when he made the first Mission Impossible -- in the time since hes married and divorced Katie Holmes jumped on Oprahs couch gotten dumped by Paramount starred in a feverish Scientology promotional video that was leaked to the public and reinvented his career as a Real Action Star the guy who does his own stunts. His public image has taken a battering and may always be fraught but onscreen hes clung to movie stardom and youth with astonishing willpower. And it works. Ethan Hunt is the kind of role thats a perfect fit for Cruises overwhelming gameness his willingness both to dangle off the worlds tallest building and to spend weeks doing cheery TV promotional appearances around the globe. Ethans aura of inhumanity in Rogue Nation syncs nicely with Cruises to create a character aware of his own larger-than-life status. ""Ive heard stories"" gasps an IMF worker upon meeting him. ""They cant all be true"" Cruise pauses then smiles like hes running through the ones hes heard himself and verifying that yes they all totally happened. Over the course of Rogue Nation Cruise now 53 vaults shirtless up a pole in handcuffs like some big-screen Pilates advertisement; he jumps off an opera house roof; he clings to a plane that takes off a much-touted stunt thats actually just the movies equivalent of a cold open; and most impressively he makes fun of his own imperviousness in the flash of alarm that flickers across his face as Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) volunteers him for an insane break-in (and in the bit of physical comedy that comes when his characters still recovering afterward). ID 6436529 The plot makes little to no sense. View this image > David James / Paramount Pictures ID 6441241 The big bad in Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation is the Syndicate a kind of evil answer to the IMF run by Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Its extra vague and ultimately meaningless what a shadow version of the organization would entail given that its never all that clear what the IMF does other than operate without oversight. Like the previous films in the franchise Rogue Nation is all multi-continent MacGuffin-chasing and the convoluted plot is only a way to ferry the characters between action sequences. The first Mission Impossible went into preproduction without a finalized script and over the years that idea has become more of a feature than a bug -- in the midst of shooting Rogue Nation shut down for a week so that a new ending could be sorted out. The movie which was directed by Christopher McQuarrie of Jack Reacher feels like it was conceived of set piece-first even more than previous installments. Thats rarely a quality to recommend but in Rogue Nation it helps create an air of blithe freedom. Who cares whats going on here? Spies Assassination attempts at the opera Motorcycle chases through Morocco Some underwater heist thing Its an insular gloriously garbled universe of hyper-competent agents running around while the rest of humanity seems unaware -- a fact the film winks at during a Senate hearing in which the IMFs past misdeeds involving the trashing of at least one international landmark are listed by an irate CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). ID 6440883 Theres a revolving door of female characters. View this image > David James / Paramount Pictures ID 6441264 Ethan Hunt is obviously the center of any Mission Impossible movie -- Cruise isnt just the star of the series hes the producer. Ving Rhamess computer expert Luther Stickell has been in all five installments as well having started as a disavowed agent Ethan recruits when on the run. Simon Peggs technician (and comic relief source) Benji Dunn was added to the franchise in Mission Impossible III while Jeremy Renners field agent turned suit William Brandt joined in Ghost Protocol. But the women come and go and theres rarely room for more than one or two of them. Maggie Q in the third film is replaced by Paula Patton in the fourth. The second films love interest Thandie Newton is swapped out in Mission Impossible III for Michelle Monaghan who shows up briefly in Ghost Protocol before retreating into normal life leaving Ethan (so far) chastely single. There are plenty of other cast members who dont make repeat appearances but its particularly noticeable with the ladies which is what makes the excellence of Rogue Nations female lead Rebecca Ferguson bittersweet. As Ilsa Faust an undercover agent trapped in a difficult position Fergusons character is set up as an answer to Cruises. Ilsa can fight shoot bluff and look excellent in a dress and she saves Ethan as often as he returns the favor all with a throwback movie star glamour and a sense of troubled vulnerability. Shes a worthy summer movie bookend to Furiosa in Mad Max Fury Road and the only downside to her character is that given the franchises history she seems unlikely to return.

By Anthony Lane Some things have held firm throughout the ""Mission Impossible"" films not least a resolute belief that the globe is made for trotting.   Credit Illustration by R. Kikuo Johnson How impossible can a mission be if it is successfully completed five times? The big-screen franchise that began in 1996 has now reached ""Mission Impossible--Rogue Nation"" directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Some things have held firm along the way not least a resolute belief that the globe is made for trotting. The new film kicks off in Belarus and whisks us to Cuba Virginia Paris Vienna Casablanca and London where our hero Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) pulls off his most amazing stunt to date by finding a functioning phone booth near Piccadilly Circus. Cruise is in excellent fettle relaxing like a high-wire artist into the tensest of predicaments and securing his status as the Dorian Gray of action movies. So what if his portrait decays with age in a vault at Paramount Pictures as long as he preserves the smooth unfading cockiness of youth? Ethan works as ever for the I.M.F. the Impossible Mission Force not the International Monetary Fund though its easy to imagine Christine Lagarde as his controller immaculate in pearls calmly instructing him to break into Greece and steal back the German cash. The hitch for Ethan is that Hunley (Alec Baldwin) the director of the C.I.A. argues that the I.M.F. is both unreliable and spent. It is accused by a congressional committee of ""wanton brinkmanship""--a nice description of this genre of movie--and promptly shut down. Needless to say circumstances lead Hunley not just to change his tune but to sing the praises of Ethan as ""the living manifestation of destiny."" Around me people howled at that line. Ungrateful beasts. How often do you get to hear Alec Baldwin sound like Ayn Rand? You could read the whole film as a reactionary plea for less transparency--for agents toiling so far below the surface of civil society on our behalf that we should not insult them with petty requests that they remain accountable. Conversely you could wind up like me so suckered by the tentacles of the plot that its ethical implications pass you by. However stateless and lawless Ethan may be once hes disavowed by the C.I.A. he is far from friendless. Pals like Luther (Ving Rhames) Benji (Simon Pegg) and Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are on hand to guide his search for the Syndicate. This is a shadowy outfit--again the open or sunlit variety is unthinkable--that is busy destabilizing the world order. Its principal is Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) who has a soft rasp in his voice and a finger in every nasty pie. ""Only Lane knows whats going to happen"" we are told. In my dreams. What this means is that we dart from one improbable set piece to the next a performance of ""Turandot"" attended by a surplus of assassins; the cracking of an underwater security system breachable only by a free diver with capacious lungs; and a motorbike chase that gives Cruise leaning sideways at speed the chance to buff his kneecaps on the curving road. These arias of suspense are conducted in lavish style by McQuarrie and its no surprise that they exhaust his powers of invention leaving the climax of the story to limp home. The Puccini sequence comes perilously early in the tale yet its a gorgeous highlight teeming with trills of visual wit and McQuarrie uses the occasion to bow as he should to Hitchcocks ""The Man Who Knew Too Much."" In a similar tribute Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) a British spy is on hand to greet Ethan and Benji when they arrive in Casablanca. As fans of Ingrid Bergman can confirm nobody should go there without meeting a beautiful woman named Ilsa preferably one whose loyalty is so mutable that men can hardly keep up. This particular Ilsa is forever switching from Lane to the good guys and back again pausing only to save Ethans skin and to prove in the process that murky though the films geopolitics may be its gender politics are a blast. And the moral is when in distress call a damsel. Of the many heists and grabs that litter the movie none is as blatant as the deft irrepressible manner in which Ferguson displaying a light smile and a brisk way with a knife steals the show. Poor Tom Cruise. He cant even steal a kiss. Author tours should not be confused with the rock-and-roll variety. Where bands face a baying throng in a cavernous stadium writers drone through random chunks of their work at the rear of provincial bookstores signing copies in the faint hope that the newly enhanced volumes will not appear on eBay before breakfast. It took courage therefore for James Ponsoldt to direct a movie called ""The End of the Tour"" which hits a dramatic peak when a novelist declines to answer questions after his reading. Mind you the novelist is David Foster Wallace (Jason Segel)--the creator of ""Infinite Jest"" and the nearest thing to a rock legend that literature has tossed up in recent decades. Complete with bandanna he even looked the part and since his death in 2008 the clamor has only swelled. Jesse Eisenberg plays David Lipsky--a lesser talent than Wallace and both men know it. (Nobody seethes as well as Eisenberg who frowns at the smallest hint of a slight.) Lipsky is commissioned by Rolling Stone to write a profile of Wallace. This entails a trip to Illinois and a snowy stay at Wallaces house after which the two men set off on the tour. Very little occurs and you can sense the movie stretching and creaking to fill the available space. Minor incidents like a tiff over a rental car are built up into showdowns. Thank heavens for Joan Cusack who plays the tour escort in Minneapolis proudly pointing out the statue of Mary Tyler Moore and declaring as she bids a breezy farewell to Wallace ""I may have to buy your book and read it"" Anybody hoping that ""The End of the Tour"" would mirror the formal dazzle of Wallaces fiction doubling back on itself like the frantically probing encounters in his 1999 collection ""Brief Interviews with Hideous Men"" will be disappointed. Yet the film despite its flatness is worth exploring just as the writers unremarkable home is picked apart by Lipsky who prowls around like a cop noting the contents of the bathroom cabinet and the photograph of Updike on the wall. Then theres Segel who doesnt just map the outer contours of Wallace (note the arms shyly crossed as if in self-protection) but gradually starts to delve down. Is his nature as sweet as it first appears or is he in the Shavian phrase of one acquaintance ""pleasantly unpleasant""? Is his dependence on junk--he gorges on a banquet of ""Falcon Crest"" ""Magnum P.I."" and ""Charlies Angels"" and invites Lipsky to dine on Diet Pepsi and Twizzlers--a heedless addiction or a loving embrace of Americana? Is he a regular guy or as Lipsky suspects a deeply irregular one striking an anxious pose? ""I dont think writers are much smarter than other people"" Wallace says. ""I think theyre more compelling in their stupidity."" Ouch. At the end we see him dancing badly and happily as if trying for a few precious minutes to shake all the words out of his mind. Another time another two-hander although in this case the hands are more evenly matched. ""Best of Enemies"" is a documentary about Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley Jr. who in 1968 were invited by ABC--then the lowliest of the networks--to lock horns during the Republican and Democratic conventions. There were ten bouts in all with Howard K. Smith as the referee and from the opening minutes it was clear that the contestants were bound together by a loathing that was stronger than death. Vidal the more complacent was also the greater pro preparing for battle by hiring a researcher and arriving armed with quotations and venomous facts to wield against his foe. Some of his zingers ad hominem and supposedly ad hoc were rehearsed beforehand and it shows. ""Hes always to the right and almost always in the wrong"" he said of Buckley on air. The latter chose to wing it and was never more attentive than when he seemed to be at ease. I spent half the movie trying to pin down whom he reminded me of with those blue-gray eyes as pale as a winter sea. When he threw his head back and bared his teeth in a harrowing grin I got it seven years ahead of schedule he looked like the poster for ""Jaws."" The rum thing about ""Best of Enemies"" directed by Morgan Neville and Robert Gordon is that it keeps interrupting the footage of the debates--veering away to more recent commentators and spoiling the flavor of the original feud. Now that TV punditry has roughened into a rant do we not deserve to see more of its lordly apogee? Maybe so except that Vidal vs. Buckley--or as I prefer to think of it Alien vs. Predator--has not improved with age. Which combatant you cleave to is beside the point since both of them teeter on the brink of the insufferable. The long drawl of their vowels however shapely bespeaks a patrician fatigue that has passed into history and is welcome to stay there. Each man was too bent on outsmarting the other to obey their nominal brief which was to assess the tremors that unnerved the convention halls and convulsed the nation beyond. For a better reckoning of 1968 you need a better writer--Norman Mailer unloved by Buckley and Vidal alike whose ""Miami and the Siege of Chicago"" covered the same events. Next to his fervid look at the sinews of power as they sweat and flex ""Best of Enemies"" is barely more than a skit.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Jul 31 2015 Culture On one level Tom Cruise is an odd choice for a star expected to anchor a spy-movie franchise. Espionage after all is largely concerned with the dispassionate collection of information and Cruise is among the least curious of performers. A defining characteristic of his onscreen persona is the reckless certitude that he already has everything figured out. (This is also as Oprah Winfrey and Matt Lauer would be happy to remind you a defining characteristic of his offscreen persona.) Cruises technique consistently eschews the interrogative in favor of the declarative. Sure hell dutifully track down missing files and identify enemy agents when tasked with such drudgery. But these are at best secondary chores connective tissue to hold together the motorcycle chases.Related Story What Mission Impossible Understands About Tom Cruise This of course is no problem at all for the Mission Impossible movies in which Cruise stars which have consistently viewed plot coherence as an unnecessary luxury and have elevated the MacGuffin to something approaching a philosophical ideal. Indeed Cruise fits perfectly as the star of the franchise for reasons that are right there in the title. You dont overcome the ""impossible"" by thinking it over a little more carefully. (Thats how you deal with the ""possible."") You overcome the impossible through the application of sheer unvarnished willpower a quality that Cruise has always possessed in abundance. Other performers might cry more persuasively for instance than Cruise did at Jason Robards bedside in Magnolia; but none will cry harder. Others might juke more gracefully in their underwear than Cruise did in Risky Business; none will juke with greater conviction.The actors trademark intensity is put to good use in the latest installment of the franchise Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation and never more so than in the opening ten minutes a Bondian prologue in which the 53-year-old actor (not a stunt double as he is justifiably eager to remind anyone wholl listen) clings to the side of a cargo plane as it takes off and ascends to 5000 feet. Its a bravura sequence. The only downside is that the movie never again quite reaches such heights so to speak.But little matter. In another scene Cruise penetrates a torus-shaped underwater vault holding his breath for what seems the length of a Bible. (According to the movies stunt director during one take Cruise didnt take a breath for six minutes.) There are fisticuffs and gunfights and an assassination attempt that takes place during a production of Puccinis Turandot. (Echoes of a similar effort at The Mikado back in 1978s Foul Play.) And there is--of course--a motorcycle chase which Cruise conducts with characteristic gusto. Asked at one point if he can track down a particular villain he replies with what could easily be his life credo ""I wont stop until I do.""The plot insofar as it matters revolves around a shadowy syndicate of ex-spies bent on global domination. (It is called conveniently enough ""the Syndicate."") Early in the movie Cruises Ethan Hunt of the ridiculously named Impossible Mission Force (IMF) is taken captive by the Syndicate before escaping with the help of a female agent (Rebecca Ferguson) of indeterminate allegiance. Hunt assembles his usual colleagues (played by Jeremy Renner Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) to take on the group. But the mission is complicated by a CIA director (Alec Baldwin) who has succeeded in persuading Congress to shut down the IMF on the grounds that it is a vestige of a bygone era. (Echoes here of nearly every Bond film since Never Say Never Again. All thats missing is the word ""dinosaur."") The 007 vibe is further heightened by a final act featuring the British Prime Minister (Tom Hollander) the head of MI6 (Simon McBurney) and a rendezvous at the Tower of London.You overcome the impossible through the application of sheer unvarnished willpower a quality that Cruise has always possessed in abundance.For the most part the supporting cast does what its paid to do support. Ferguson holds her own in the physical charisma department and Sean Harris makes the most of his role as the head of the Syndicate all soft murmurs and stylish eyewear. Alas Baldwin gives the strong impression that he has Nicholson-like become too large a character in his own right to convincingly play anyone else at least in non-comic roles. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (teaming with Cruise again following 2012s Jack Reacher) keeps things moving along briskly and with appropriate levity though the movie overstays its welcome slightly at a bit over two hours.But its Cruise who serves--almost literally--as the engine driving the movie. His performance is difficult to rate in the customary sense because he has entered a phase in his career when ""acting"" seems almost tangential to his job description. There was a time when Cruise was eager to test his mettle with such fare as Born on the Fourth of July and Eyes Wide Shut and Magnolia. But the challenges hes set for himself lately seem principally physical in nature as if by hanging off planes and diving underwater he can stop his own clock from ticking into middle age. Its an exercise simultaneously triumphant and dispiriting and there is an odd fascination in watching how much longer he can pull it off. Another Jack Reacher movie is planned along with at least one more installment of Mission Impossible and Cruise has expressed interest in making sequels to Edge of Tomorrow and even Top Gun. Love him or hate him Tom Cruise still has no intention of stopping.

Twitter previousWhites Have More Debt Than Latinos and Blacksnext Killing Them Softly The Juvenile Justice System Is Complicit in Lost Lives Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 31 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 31 2015 848AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Christopher McQuarrie Written by Christopher McQuarrie Drew Pearce Starring Starring Tom Cruise Rebecca Ferguson Simon Pegg Jeremy Renner Ving Rhames Genre action Country USA Language English Tom Cruise is not like us mere mortals. At 53 years old the actor is a living breathing manifestation of pure determination - more motivational poster than man. Physically ripped constantly engaged and possessing a quite possibly insane desire to do each and every one of his own stunts Cruise is the platonic ideal of an action star. And thank god for that. Tom Cruise takes his turn in a lip-sync battle with Jimmy .Fallon YouTube Multimedia Tom Cruise defeats Jimmy Fallon in impressive lip-sync battle The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way In an industry obsessed with the shiny and new Cruise is a refreshing and reliable throwback. We may occasionally reduce him to a Scientology-obsessed nut but thats just because its easy and cynical two things that the entertainment news cycle relies on. Xenu aside Cruise holds a rightful critical spot in the language of blockbuster cinema. Hes the slick charming captivating man of action who we all secretly want to be. Hes pure popcorn.The fact that Cruise never slips into leading man complacency - always insisting on working with the top filmmakers always developing intense rehearsal procedures for stunts that should very well end him - is also what keeps his improbable Mission Impossible brand afloat.On the surface theres no reason that the series should be releasing its fifth instalment. Based on a mostly forgotten TV show each entry in the franchise is essentially a facsimile of the other Theres the hunt for a MacGuffin an exotic beauty who tempts Cruises Ethan Hunt into trouble (although never sexually) a threat to dismantle the IMF agency and a generic villain who purports to be Hunts equal but never warrants even half his attention (the only exception to this last rule is Mission Impossible III because of Philip Seymour Hoffmans delightful sociopath).Yet each MI film is its own unique thrill ride largely thanks to Cruises non-stop charisma and fierce dedication to being the best implausibly talented spy he can be. (And before you ask Yes I will even go to bat for John Woos second entry a wildly weird exercise in genre extremes.)The series continues its surprising streak in this latest entry nonsensically subtitled Rogue Nation. The storys beats again are familiar Hunt faces off against a twisted mirror-image of himself in the form of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) a former MI6 agent whos building a capital-E Evil organization called the Syndicate as all the unique villain organization names were already taken.Somewhere in the middle of all this theres Rebecca Ferguson as the deep-cover spy Ilsa Faust (now thats a name) and returning players Simon Pegg Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames. But its a bit pointless to spend much time deciphering co-star performances or picking apart the nuances of the plot. Everything even Alec Baldwins tight and itchy turn as a CIA buzzkill is mere window-dressing to Cruises attempts to kill himself on-screen.Anyone whos stepped outside their home in the past few months will have already seen the image of Cruise hanging from the outside of a moving plane Rogue Nations signature visual. Yet despite the promotional overkill the scene still feels terrifyingly fresh on the big screen. Sure we dont actually get to witness Cruise plummeting to his doom but the fact that he knew the possibility was there when he filmed it and still went for it with gusto is a remarkable mix of showmanship and hubris.The same goes for Cruises other brushes with on-screen death including a frantic motorcycle chase through the streets of Morocco a taut cat-and-mouse game behind the scenes of a Vienna opera and an underwater plunge to the most improbable data-storage facility in the world (during which he reportedly held his breath for six minutes which is as crazy as it sounds).During filming of the fourth MI film whose subtitle of Ghost Protocol is still the series best joke it was rumoured that Renner was being groomed to take over the franchise. Thankfully his by-the-book hero Brandt never caught fire beyond a supporting role - not that the actor was really to blame. Who after all could make suicide missions look as much fun as Tom Cruise?

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 31 2015 Save for later Saved Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation stars Tom Cruise (l.) and Rebecca Ferguson (r.). David James/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide One of the big problems with action movie franchises is that they have to keep topping the ""wow"" factor of each preceding film. Inevitably things level off. This is what seems to have happened in ""Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation"" which in terms of the high bar set by Brad Birds ""Ghost Protocol"" its immediate predecessor is underwhelming. But writer-director Christopher McQuarrie whose action movie skills are at best high-adequate compensates by being good at interpersonal stuff. He can make us feel for the characters as something more than action toys.At 53 Tom Cruise reprising his role as Ethan Hunt is almost alarmingly spry (and appears to be doing many of his stunts). The IMF has been shut down by the CIA (headed by Alec Baldwin in prime surly mode) and Ethan eluding the agencys dragnet is on a worldwide undercover mission to uncover the nefarious Syndicate a power-mad organization the CIA does not even believe exists. Joining Ethan are his partners from the last film Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Benji (Simon Pegg) along with basso profondo Ving Rhames but the most interesting addition to the corps is Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) a fearsome agent who may or may not be working for the Syndicate. In the films best extended sequence set in Morocco Ethan must dislodge a top-secret computer chip from an underwater lair while holding his breath for more than three minutes. Ilsa comes to the rescue - or does she? (A recurring motif from Puccinis ""Turandot"" on the soundtrack pointedly intrudes whenever these two get googly-eyed.) Recommended The 50 best movies of all time The requisite car and motorcycle chases are all here and the Syndicates chief played by Sean Harris is appropriately reptilian.  Once you accept the fact that ""Rogue Nation"" is not going to be the wingding of the franchise it becomes a lot easier to enjoy.

Bo Bridges/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Bo Bridges/Paramount Pictures A spry 52 when the film was shot Tom Cruise -- still his own stuntman -- careens a motorcycle sans helmet around a winding Moroccan highway at suicide-miles-per-hour. Bo Bridges/Paramount Pictures The most mercilessly thrilling action sequence of 2015 is still the entirety of Mad Max Fury Road. But a credible challenger has at last arrived in the perilously punctuated Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation a super-fun sequel that spends its best 15 minutes at the Vienna State Opera. In this masterful set piece various constituencies of spy and counterspy angle to assassinate or protect the Chancellor of Austria whos watching Puccinis Turandot from a balcony box -- oblivious like the rest of the audience to the sweaty melee playing out literally in the wings. Ethan Hunt the colorless odorless highly acrobatic secret agent embodied by Tom Cruise fights a side of Slavic beef 150 percent his own size. Elsewhere a new-to-the-series spy of murky loyalties played by the ravishing Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson waits for a specified note in the score to fire her rifle. Onstage a Chinese prince tries to solve three riddles to win the hand of Princess Turandot. The price of a wrong answer in Puccinis opera is his life. Clipped out of the almost-as-good 131-minute feature surrounding it this sequence would work beautifully as a short film. Its a sterling example of the elegance wit and harrowing flesh-and-blood stunt work that have made the ""Missions Impossible"" the most reliable blockbuster series going Five films some weirder than others but not a stinker in the bunch. The only thing that (slightly) disappoints about the otherwise copacetic new Rogue Nation is that unlike every prior Mission its not a big stylistic departure from its predecessor 2011s Brad Bird-directed best-seen-in-IMAX Ghost Protocol. Every entry has come from a different auteur director and Cruise-the-producer has allowed each one to leave their stamp on the malleable franchise. This time its Christopher McQuarrie a veteran screenwriter and relatively green director who previously teamed with Cruise on Jack Reacher and Edge of Tomorrow. Like those two overlooked gems Rogue Nation is exciting stylish and funny. Its also 10 minutes too long an overage I suspect McQuarrie wouldve corrected had the films original release date not been moved up by five months. There are a few factors contributing to the deja vu 1) Rogue Nations retains more of the previous films players than is customary. Hunt allies Simon Pegg and Jeremy Renner both get major screen time and Ving Rhames the only actor besides Cruise to show up in every movie has an expanded role. 2) Robert Elswit the Oscar-winning cinematographer who provided Ghost Protocols desert gloss is back giving this follow-up a similarly airy look. 3) Cruise has the same haircut for two consecutive movies. 4) The plot involves Hunt going you know rogue and being um hunted by his own government -- for the fourth time in five films But what Rogue Nation lacks in novelty it more than makes up for with verve. A spry 52 when the film was shot Cruise -- still his own stuntman -- clings to the fuselage of an Airbus A400 cargo plane flying thousands of feet off the ground swims underwater for several minutes without a breath careens a motorcycle sans helmet around a winding Moroccan highway at suicide-miles-per-hour and uses his oft-demonstrated if little-remarked spider-strength to shimmy up a pole to which hes handcuffed using only his hips and his abs. Are you not entertained? Woven in among the capers is an espionage story that recalls the first film the Brian De Palma-directed Mission Impossible of a generation ago by being more opaque than is strictly necessary. Im sure Ill sort it out on a second or third viewing. All that matters is that Fergusons Ilsa Faust (great name that) is a marvelous addition; a smooth alluring operator who is Hunts equal in every way. Her signature move when clobbering taller male opponents is to leap onto their shoulders and wrestle them to the ground with her legs. It never gets old. And unlike the heroine of the years biggest hit Jurassic World shes sensible enough to take off her heels before rappelling down the side of a building. Theres only a flicker of attraction between her and Hunt. Theres some other inspired casting. Sean Harris who plays the leader of a ring of presumed-dead covert agents now using their skills to sow strategic unrest looks like a lab-grown hybrid of good guys Cruise and Pegg. And Alec Baldwin brings his welcome comic pomposity as a C.I.A. official who convinces a Senate panel to shutter and defund the Impossible Mission Force making Hunt a fugitive. Trying to sum up the danger of allowing Hunt to roam free Baldwin is reduced to poetic abstraction. He reels off all the usual superspy credentials before concluding ""Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny."" Its an absurd line and the movie couldve used a few more of those. (McQuarrie gave Cruise better jokes in Jack Reacher). But you wont remember it. Because even without the Turandot sequence Rogue Nation still has at least three other stand-up-and-cheer set pieces executed with a rigor and clarity the crude Fast amp; Furious series cant touch. Everyone knows action speaks louder than words.

The masses will eat it up. And really who can blame them?No one really. Hollywood is very good at this stuff even if in the end this stuff really does feel like stuff. It doesnt feel important or moving certainly not thought-provoking or life-enhancing. Its the cinematic equivalent of a Happy Meal.Hey a lot of people eat Happy Meals.So its Tom Cruise again playing daredevil super spy Ethan Hunt (in reality the MI franchise is just another spin around the James Bond roulette wheel). This time hes trying to bring down yet another dastardly network of bad guys; the (slight) twist is that the network is made up of other super spies from assorted worldwide agencies whove elected to go to the dark side.Complicating things the blockheads in Washington led by a new CIA chief (Alec Baldwin) have decided to disband the Impossible Mission task force (or whatever its called) so Hunt is now on his own. Oh wait its actually worse -- the CIA now wants to kill Hunt. Now hes really-really on his own. Thats the ""Rogue Nation"" part of the title.Except hes not really on his own of course. As things progress he reunites with goofy right-hand man Benji (Simon Pegg) computer wizard Luther (Ving Rhames) and bureaucrat-spy William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) who wandered into the franchise somewhere in the last sequel.Complicating things further is the mysterious Ilsa (the mysterious Rebecca Ferguson) a woman who shows up to torture Hunt but then ends up saving him. She may or may not be working for the shadowy organization even as she becomes a sort of auxiliary member of Hunts team.OK enough with the personalities lets get on with the stunts. The film opens with a biggie as Hunt clings to the outside of an airplane as it takes to the sky. Nicely done. Then there are your standard-issue full-speed car and motorcycle chases and spectacular shoot-outs along with some operatic assassination acrobatics and a gurgling underwater adventure.Its all very breathless but then its supposed to be. We like our Happy Meals breathlessThe most -- only -- intriguing question posed by ""Rogue Nation"" is what would Rebecca Ferguson look like in a serious film? Will we ever know? She certainly rocks this cartoon (her final confrontation is the movies highlight).Cruise is of course his charming cocky self but at 53 you have to wonder how much more action silliness he has in him (some apparently next up are ""Top Gun 2"" and another Jack Reacher film). Remember when he used to make real movies? Actually the answer to that for an entire generation is likely no. Well he did and some of them were quite good.For now though its Happy Meals.

The character is either a double (good) or triple (bad) agent -- but its the type of bad that would make most of us want to switch our allegiances in a heartbeat. Actually Fergusons mom is a Brit which would account for the slight smirk that suggests naughty secrets on an otherwise coolly beautiful face as well as the kitty-cat purr that makes routine lines sound as insouciant as Emma Peel. Ferguson is a scary-good fighter too. One minute shes still the next she has wrapped her strong limbs around some scummy thug and is pounding away. She fights like someone who thinks more about winning than striking poses. Related Stories Mission Impossible a Rogue Nationas New Trailer Swaps Out Lauryn Hill for Led Zeppelin Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation doesnt have the nonsensical lyricism of Brad Birds stupendous Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol but its still pretty good. It works best when like Ferguson it plays things straight instead of (mis)using Simon Peggs Impossible Mission Team techie for broad comic relief and Ving Rhames for Lou Grant-like grumpiness. Dull as they usually were the old poker-faced TV Mission Impossible crew had dignity. They werent always blubbering ""Im working on it Hang on Aaauuggghh"" when one of their thingamajigs jammed. The series is also becoming almost as huggy and self-congratulatory as the Fast and Furious films. The plot of Rogue Nation has Ethan Hunt (Cruise) once again cast out of the fold branded as a madman or worse by a CIA director Hunley (Alec Baldwin) who wants to shut the Impossible Mission Force down on the grounds that it operates without transparency or oversight. There are so many layers of irony here (the CIA whining about lack of oversight the casting of ultraliberal Baldwin) that Hunleys congressional debate with IMF coordinator Brandt (Jeremy Renner in the action-movie equivalent of a desk job) ought to be more fun than it is. Ethans crime is arguing that theres an anti-IMF at large a ""rogue nation"" called ""the Syndicate"" thats ... doing a lot of bad things. This makes Hunley so angry that he puts much of the CIAs resources into catching Ethan -- while various members of his former team chuckle to themselves that no army could catch Ethan Hunt; hes that smart cunning dexterous muscular sexually potent etc. The script is by director Christopher McQuarrie whose characters voiced similar sentiments about Cruises hero in the pairs last collaboration Jack Reacher. A new strain of highbrow fanboy is lately making a case for McQuarrie as an unsung action auteur. Would it were so. He doesnt have the visual panache to pull off the slapstick-derring-do prologue in which Cruise hangs from an escaping terrorist plane while his hysterical team tries to get the door open for him. An early subterranean martial-arts clash is edited for maximum chop. A triple-assassin shoot-out with fisticuffs in a Vienna opera house has one or two good moments but McQuarrie wants so nakedly for it to be a Brian De Palma-style spatial-temporal tour de force that its semi-coherence is an embarrassment. On the other hand he delivers a corker of a high-speed motorcycle chase -- the road-level camerawork rattles you down to your joints. A climactic knife fight between Ferguson and a burly villain known as the ""Bone Doctor"" works like gangbusters It doesnt have too many variables and it isnt broken up by one-liners. As the icily malignant leader of ""the Syndicate"" the twisty-faced Sean Harris is like a medieval demon with thick glasses. He and Hunt have a splendid climactic stare-down -- elegantly staged and surprising. And McQuarrie has one foolproof weapon Lalo Schifrins original TV theme blasted so triumphantly whenever Cruise and Company do something right that its like the action-movie equivalent of Beethovens ""Ode to Joy.""

This time hes taking on the Syndicate a rogue nation of operatives coming after the IMF. VPCTom Cruise returns as the plucky IMF agent Ethan Hunt.(Photo Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 3 1/2 stars out of 5Tom Cruise Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames return in fifth installment joined by Alec Baldwin.New director Christopher McQuarrie is the Oscar-winning screenwriter of ""The Usual Suspects.""You couldnt say that making a ""Mission Impossible"" movie is easy exactly but Tom Cruises globe-trotting spy-caper franchise -- based on the hit TV series from the 60s and 70s -- certainly has a reliable formula.The worst-reviewed installment No. ""II"" (per Rotten Tomatoes) was nonetheless an entertainingly frenetic shoot-emup while the worst performer at the box office ""III"" still grossed nearly 400 million worldwide.RELATED Top 10 thrilling action flicks""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" is the fifth film and is helmed by the series fifth director Christopher McQuarrie. Also the co-writer (his screenplay credits include the Oscar-winning ""The Usual Suspects"") McQuarrie delivers a tense eye-popping amusement-park ride thats almost as exciting as it is forgettable.Theres nothing plausible in ""Rogue Nation"" -- not that that really matters. (Photo Paramount Pictures)The plot which is of zero importance to ones enjoyment of the movie once again has Cruises agent Ethan Hunt on the outs with the U.S. government and freelancing the job of saving the world. With his colleagues from the IMF -- thats Impossible Mission Force not International Monetary Fund -- leashed by a bureaucratic CIA director (Alec Baldwin) Hunt is on the trail of the Syndicate a shadowy ""anti-IMF"" staffed by rogue operatives from spy agencies around the world.The investigation takes him to the Vienna Opera House for fisticuffs with a would-be assassin on the catwalks backstage and then to Casablanca for a convoluted break-and-enter job and motorcycle chase. Meanwhile Hunt finds an ally in Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) a fetching Brit with a deadly skill set working as a double agent although its not clear for whom.AZCENTRALMission Impossible Rogue Nation (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReturning cast members include IMFers played by Ving Rhames (doughy but menacing) and Simon Pegg (always welcome as comic relief) but the real stars of any ""Mission Impossible"" movie arent the actors but all the action-flick bells and whistles from the elaborately choreographed stunt sequences to the sci-fi gadgets. (The contact-lens cameras are years ahead of Google Glass for example. And who wouldnt want a 3-D printer to create latex masks?

"Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation and an impossible romance review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMission Impossible -- Rogue Nation and an impossible romance review At age 53 Tom Cruise is still a credible action hero. But in Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation he gets a run for his money -- and his heart from a rival spy played by Rebecca FergusonBy Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. July 30 2015Mission Impossible -- Rogue NationStarring Tom Cruise Rebecca Ferguson Simon Pegg Jeremy Renner Ving Rhames Alec Baldwin and Sean Harris. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie. At GTA theatres. 131 minutes. PGYou must remember this about Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation even if the plot details threaten to self-destruct in five seconds.Its the smouldering suggestion of romance between Tom Cruises unstoppable Ethan Hunt and series newcomer Rebecca Fergusons inscrutable Ilsa Faust. Article Continued BelowThe chance of a love connection between these rival spies fascinates more than the predictably entertaining car and motorbike chases ticking time bombs and ""impossible"" action set pieces the franchise trades in much like the 007 series it imitates. (MIA from this M I are aspects of Hunts personal life that were revealed in the previous two films.)Rebecca Ferguson gives Tom Cruise a run for his money in the latest Mission Impossible sequel.Not by accident does a major story development happen in Casablanca one of the films many frantic and scenic global stops. And the Stockholm-born Ferguson strongly resembles fellow Swede Ingrid Bergman who starred opposite Humphrey Bogart in the classic wartime romance situated in and titled after the Moroccan desert city. Of course you would never have caught Bogie hanging from the side of a departing jet. Hunt does this in the opening sequence that has already been revealed in the trailer for this fifth impossible mission which this time has been capably directed by Christopher McQuarrie Cruises favourite screenwriter who shares the script duties with Drew Pearce (Iron Man 3). But theres a similar intense willingness to sacrifice personal fulfilment for the safety of the planet or war effort as the case may be.And Fergusons Ilsa like Bergmans Ilsa Lund makes for a worthy obsession. Shes a true femme fatale one who is every bit Hunts match physically and mentally. Ilsa may be working for dastardly dweeb Soloman Lane played by Sean Harris the head of a Bondlike evil agency called the Syndicate. But if so why is she willing to bail Ethan out of dangerous scrapes?Her motives and loyalties are as unreadable as her emotions which helps maintain interest in a story that rekindles the fugitive status for the Impossible Mission Force previously established in the fourth chapter Ghost Protocol. Alec Baldwin plays the CIA chief determined to once and for all shut down the IMF which has been deemed to be engaging in ""wanton brinksmanship."" All the covert cooing between Ethan and Ilsa means other IMF characters played by Simon Pegg Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames end up looking like bit players although Peggs gadget guy Benji is increasingly more of a serious sidekick than comic-relief clown.At age 53 Tom Cruise is still a credible action hero. But this time Rebecca Ferguson really gives him a run for his money and his heart.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review In Rogue Nation Tom Cruise once again accomplishes the near-impossible - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Once again Tom Cruise accomplishes the near-impossible in Rogue Nation Review In Rogue Nation Cruise once again accomplishes the near-impossible Bo Bridges / Paramount Pictures Tom Cruise in ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation."" Tom Cruise in ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation."" (Bo Bridges / Paramount Pictures) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter As an actor and producer the ""Mission Impossible"" series has been good to Tom Cruise and he continues to return the favor.""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" is the fifth film in a series that has taken in more than 2 billion in worldwide box office and has provided the one role that of secret agent Ethan Hunt the performer can count on since the series made the jump from television to theaters in 1996. In return Cruise has been a vigilant steward of the franchise making sure its various components (including its celebrated Lalo Schifrin theme) never fall below acceptable standards and even pushing to exceed the norm where possible.SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt; So it is with the polished and entertaining new film the kind of neo-James Bond spy-versus-spy diversion where secrets are ""triple encoded"" and agents in trouble sound like ambitious dentists when they request ""immediate extraction."" Photos Both in front of and behind the camera ""Rogue Nation"" has been smoothly made by people who know just how to get entertainment business done and have often worked with Cruise before.That is very much true of filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie who was a writer on two Cruise ventures (""Valkyrie"" and ""Edge of Tomorrow"") and directed the actors ""Jack Reacher"" venture.Teaming up with cinematographer Robert Elswit and production designer Jim Bissell both of whom worked on the earlier ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" McQuarrie is adept at keeping things moving and has overseen two areas where ""Rogue Nation"" stands out from the crowd. Director Christopher McQuarries unlikely path to Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation Steven Zeitchik Near a leafy square in this bustling capital filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie sat in a screening room tilting his head at scenes from the new movie ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation."" In one scene Tom Cruises Ethan Hunt slid a BMW Formula One style through narrow streets in Morocco and... Near a leafy square in this bustling capital filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie sat in a screening room tilting his head at scenes from the new movie ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation."" In one scene Tom Cruises Ethan Hunt slid a BMW Formula One style through narrow streets in Morocco and... (Steven Zeitchik) The first is physical action. Though the ""Mission Impossible"" films are known for Cruise doing his own eye-popping stunts (he climbed Dubais Burj Khalifa the worlds tallest building in ""Ghost Protocol"") the actor sets a new standard for himself here.The opening stunt in ""Rogue Nation"" is the films nerve-racking signature moment as Hunt the key operative for the super-secret IMF or Impossible Mission Force finds himself clinging to the side of a four-engine Airbus A400 turbo-prop military plane as it takes off from an airbase in Belarus carrying a cargo of VX poison gas.Yes that really is Cruise clinging to the side of the departing aircraft by his fingertips (hes actually attached by a single harness he wears under his clothes). So dangerous that Cruise had to wear custom contact lenses to protect his eyes the stunt was repeated eight times until actor and director had the coverage they needed.While agent Hunt is thus risking his life to save the free world CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) is testifying before a secret congressional committee about how the IMFs ""pattern of wanton brinkmanship"" is so dangerous that it should be disbanded. Which it promptly is.That leaves Hunt as a man without a country an international fugitive sought by the CIA just as he is closing in on a nefarious organization known as the Syndicate.A group as dangerous as its name is bland the Syndicate is manned exclusively by missing or presumed dead former government secret agents like the Bone Doctor (Jens Hulten) whos there to hurt you not help you.See the most-read stories this hour gt;gt;In charge of these merry men is the super-nasty always nihilistic Solomon Lane played by an excellent Sean Harris an evil genius who will stop at nothing (nothing do you hear) to destabilize the world and throw it into chaos. A rogue nation indeed.With just his own merry men (returning ""MI"" veterans Jeremy Renner Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) to help him Hunt no surprise is determined to stop the Syndicate because to quote an associate he is ""the living manifestation of destiny."" Try putting that on your resume.Films like this always foreground a glamorous woman of mystery and while ""Rogue Nation"" has one this is the second area where the film feels different.Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson brings a bit of unexpected maturity and substance to the role of the inscrutable Ilsa Faust an individual who is fully Hunts equal and then some in derring-do. Yes she has a scene in a black bikini but youd better believe she is wearing it for an operational reason.Hunt and Faust share in most of ""Rogue Nations"" expert action scenes (Wade Eastwood is the stunt coordinator) including a hair-raising motorcycle chase a dangerous assault on a nominally impregnable underwater vault called the Taurus and assorted high jinks inside and outside Viennas venerable State Opera House. (Thats American tenor Gregory Kunde heard singing the classic aria ""Nessun dorma"" from ""Turandot"" as the action heats up.)Cruise has played Ethan Hunt so often it would be understandable if he phoned it in but one of the pleasures of ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" is that he doesnt. As the films plot gets twistier and twistier as knowing who you can trust becomes increasingly difficult Ethan Hunt never wavers. Kind of like ""the living manifestation of destiny"" if you know what I mean.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------Mission Impossible -- Rogue NationRating PG-13 for sequences of action and violence and brief partial nudityRunning time 2 hours 11 minutesPlaying In general release------------MOREThe mini-mogul behind Relativity Media said hed change Hollywood now he faces bankruptcy The Diary of a Teenage Girl is a rare film that explores female sexuality without judgmentVacation Road trip comedy goes downhill reviews say Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Tom Cruise Reviews Simon Pegg Relativity Media Alec Baldwin Tom Cruise | Career in Pictures Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-mission-impossible-rogue-nation-review-20150731-column.html,200,missionimpossible-roguenation13,missionimpossible-roguenation,latimes

The action bonanza gets a little lost in its own spycraft but offers scenes both fast and furious and a fabulous couple of additions to the world of the IMF (short for Impossible Mission Force obviously).USA TODAYMission tests new recruit Rebecca FergusonThe Rogue Nation part of the title refers to a nefarious new secret organization called the Syndicate which utilizes presumed-dead operatives from around the world to carry out terrorist acts and tear down the global system that spawned them. Well Ethan will have none of that as Americas top secret agent though hes a fugitive from the government itself after one too many rogue missions.USA TODAYTom Cruise powers Mission with personalityFrom Belarusian airspace to the Vienna Opera to the streets of Morocco the hero plays cat-and-mouse with a new villain on the scene -- Solomon Lane played with cold calm by Sean Harris -- while making an ally in the mysterious Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) a capable agent and lethal weapon herself who has been dealing with the devilish Lane.With a number of movies under its belt the MI franchise finally has Avengered itself -- previous cinematic shenanigans are referred to when CIA chief Alan Hunley (a delightfully smarmy Alec Baldwin) makes a power play to shut down the IMF crew once and for all. Its like a greatest hits squad of supporting players surrounding Ethan including by-the-book agent William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) hacker extraordinaire Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and tech guy Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) who finally gets thrown into some dangerous fieldwork.USA TODAYTom Cruise held his breath for HOW long for Mission Impossible underwater scenes?Rogue Nation gets convoluted in its series of twists though McQuarrie offers a surprising amount of welcome humor sometimes with the gadgetry -- watch Tom use a bass flute as a rifle -- and other times in the exhaustion that comes after one death-defying episode or another.While not as top notch as the action scenes in the previous Impossible outing Ghost Protocol theres some stellar stuff here especially a speedy chase through Casablanca on motorcycles and in sports cars with a soundtrack comprised solely of revving engines and Peggs panicky screams.USA TODAYWhy Rebecca Ferguson kicks Mission buttTheres not much character development involved with Ethan this time around though you dont need it as much with all the stunts Cruise is doing. (And at 53 dudes still outstanding.) Yet his match is made in Fergusons enigmatic Ilsa an attractive bone-breaker of a femme fatale who looks like she stepped right off the set of a 007 adventure.Teaming her with Cruise again would be a mission impossible not to watch. 33 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1I5gk8h",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/07/30/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-movie-review/30818495/,200,missionimpossible-roguenation14,missionimpossible-roguenation,usatoday

Comments click to enlarge Mission Impossible--Rogue Nation Recommended Rated PG-13  131 minutes  2015 Yes producer-star Tom Cruise really did hang off the side of an airplane 5000 feet in the air to shoot the jaw-dropping action set piece that opens this fifth installment in his Mission Impossible franchise. If Buster Keaton had pulled this off it would be legendary so now might be the time to concede that Cruise the worlds oldest and richest adolescent has invited us into his unhinged fantasy life in the tradition of some of our most beloved filmmakers. (Any attempts at serious acting are pretty much over though--more than a decade has passed since Collateral Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut). Five movies in Cruise has perfected the MI formula--a simple spy story passable character comedy and extremely long impressively sustained action sequences; second only to the plane escapade is an assassination attempt at the Vienna Opera that honors its debt to The Man Who Knew Too Much.

"Review Mission accomplished for Cruise in new MI flick | The Big Story Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Review Mission accomplished for Cruise in new MI flick By JOCELYN NOVECK Jul. 29 2015 456 PM EDT Theres some interesting talk in the cleverly satisfying script of ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" about the element of luck. As in How much is luck a factor in the success of Ethan Hunt and his IMF cohorts? After all in the last movie they merely saved us from a nuclear holocaust. Was it talent work or dumb luck?Whatever you decide about that lets be clear about this When it comes to Tom Cruise and his durability as an action hero luck has little to do with it. The guys an action star extraordinaire and its not luck or chance but work and smarts and yes some swashbuckling derring-do that get him there. Whatever you may think of Cruise and his complex off-screen persona lets give him this At age 53 he and his Ethan Hunt are if anything getting more fun to watch. And they make ""Rogue Nation"" not merely a serviceable summer flick but an entertainment well worth your inflated ticket price.Lets give kudos to a few other folks too starting with director-writer Christopher McQuarrie who like each director in the franchise puts his own stamp on the proceedings. McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"") does this with both a wry script that often makes fun of whats happening and some seriously entertaining action pieces including a complicated assassination sequence set in Viennas glittering opera house during a lavish production of Puccinis ""Turandot."" (Parents heres a chance to get some opera into your kids summer -- sort of like hiding the broccoli in the brownie mix.)Also invaluable is returning ""MI"" vet Simon Pegg as Benji the wise-cracking (and safe-cracking) computer whiz who provides a crucial dose not only of humor but also of humanity here. Welcome newcomers include Alec Baldwin as a pompous CIA boss with deliciously dry delivery and Rebecca Ferguson making the most and then some of the obligatory female role. Ferguson is -- get this -- Swedish-born named Ilsa here and yes shows up in Casablanca too.""Rogue Nation"" doesnt start slowly. In fact it begins with the scene youre most likely to have heard about because it involves Cruises own stunt work in which the actor actually places himself on the wing of an airborne jet and then -- why not? -- lets his legs slip hanging on by only his hands as the landscape beneath gets tinier and tinier.Why is Hunt on the wing? Well thats what can happen annoyingly when you try to board a plane AFTER takeoff. He manages to successfully remove a case of nerve gas canisters but were just getting started.We soon learn that the IMF is being disbanded and the timing is terrible. Hunt is onto something really bad the Syndicate a nefarious group of former spies led by a vague sinister leader (Sean Harris). That the Syndicate is not attached to one particular nation -- it is the ""Rogue Nation"" of the title -- has eerie resonance in todays world.Hunt soon finds himself chained to a ceiling in a London dungeon. Enter Ilsa (Ferguson) who obviously has some attraction to Hunt and a tendency to save his life but also is clearly not working with him either.The two meet again in Vienna and eventually in Morocco where Hunt and his friends take on a mission that involves for one thing Hunt holding his breath underwater for an impossibly long time while fighting an impossibly strong water current and many other things.It shouldnt surprise you by now to hear that Cruise apparently flirted with on-set danger here too. And its impossible to deny that this knowledge adds to the fun. Early on when Hunt was hanging off that plane my 12-year-old companion -- whos grown up in the age of computer-generated wizardry -- confidently whispered ""Ha thats totally a green screen."" And I was happy to be able to whisper back""Nope. Thats just Tom Cruise.""""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" a Paramount release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""sequences of intense action and violence.""

Keeping it alive and vital for nearly two decades is very difficult. Having the fourth film in the series turn out to be the best of the bunch is damn near unheard of. Topping that it seems might actually be impossible. Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation in theatres Friday is a decently fun summer blockbuster. Its not however the best Mission Impossible film. Not by a long shot. Star producer and ridiculously buff 53-year-old Tom Cruise returns for the fifth time as Ethan Hunt lead agent of the Impossible Mission Force. After the events of 2011s Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol which ended with the Kremlin blown up and San Francisco nearly nuked Hunt and his pals Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) have been disavowed and stripped of their status by no-nonsense CIA director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). But since this is pretty much what happened in Ghost Protocol we know its not going to keep Hunt and the gang down for long. Especially once Hunt gets a whiff of the Syndicate an anti-IMF made up of former spies gone rogue. Under the guidance of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris who seems to be channeling a classic Bond villain) the Syndicate has committed all manner of terrorist acts in a bid to reshape regions of the world according to their agenda. And they MUST BE STOPPED. Dun-dun DUH NUH dun-dun DUH NUH doodoladooooooo doodoladooooooo doodoladooooooo BA-NAH. (Not the best song-to-text interpretation of the Mission Impossible theme music but you get the idea.) After the commercial and critical success of director Brad Birds Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol Rogue Nations Christopher McQuarrie who also directed Cruise in the mostly meh Jack Reacher has his work cut out for him. And while you can almost see the checklist that hes working from dutifully crossing off items like ""insane set-piece stunt that Cruise does himself"" ""tense infiltration hinging on a disguise powered by spotty tech"" and ""lovely leggy woman in a tight evening gown"" the result never quite gels the way it did in the previous films. The lovely leggy woman in Rogue Nation is Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson possibly the best thing about the movie. With the face of a 1930s Hollywood siren and the moves of a late-model Terminator Fergusons double agent Ilsa Faust (subtlety thy name is not Rogue Nation) lights up every scene shes in whether shes beating the living crap out of a gang of henchmen or trying to outmaneuver the big baddie in a game of mental chess. Id love to see her become a fixture in the franchise. Or hell just cast her as the next James Bond. There are lots of big moments in Rogue Nation beginning with the much-publicized stunt that has Cruise hanging off the side of a cargo plane as it takes off and continuing with a wonderfully tense Austrian standoff (like a Mexican standoff except set in an old-world opera house where the shooters arent sure whos aiming at whom) a wild underwater data centre infiltration (see if you can hold your breath as long as Tom Cruise) and an extended chase sequence in which Cruise appears to be doing a lot of his own motorbiking. And the story which is angling for more of the shadowy spycraft vibe of the original Mission Impossible darts all around the globe from Austria to Morocco to England and beyond. But theres just not a lot of zing or zest here and the connective tissue between the action sequences feels stiff. Had this been Cruises first outing as Ethan Hunt we might have been dazzled. But hes fallen victim to his own success with this franchise and Rogue Nation cant match the organic character chemistry of Ghost Protocol nor the high personal stakes (and much better villain) of Mission Impossible III. Its simultaneously a little too cool and a little too hokey for its own good and has what might be the most anticlimactic final confrontation of the series. You half expect a bad guy to mutter that hed have gotten away with it all if it wasnt for these meddling kids. While certainly not a disappointment Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation sticks too closely to the franchise formula. And unlike its buff star the whole thing is starting to show its age.

Keeping it alive and vital for nearly two decades is very difficult. Having the fourth film in the series turn out to be the best of the bunch is damn near unheard of. Topping that it seems might actually be impossible. Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation in theatres Friday is a decently fun summer blockbuster. Its not however the best Mission Impossible film. Not by a long shot. Star producer and ridiculously buff 53-year-old Tom Cruise returns for the fifth time as Ethan Hunt lead agent of the Impossible Mission Force. After the events of 2011s Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol which ended with the Kremlin blown up and San Francisco nearly nuked Hunt and his pals Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) have been disavowed and stripped of their status by no-nonsense CIA director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin).

Share This Story Share Discuss Meh There is not an original bone in Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nations battered bloody but freakishly toned body. Its globe-trotting double-crossing death-defying eardrum-rattling wise-cracking good-looking shenanigans are a mirepoix of every action-adventure film since Alfred Hitchcock was in short pants. This is comfort-food cinema. Gorge on the endless buffet.The fifth -- and easily the best -- installment in the based-on-an-old-TV-show franchise is the loudest fastest hardest version of every action-adventure-spy thriller youve ever seen. Take Casablanca early Connery-era Bond Cary Grant- and Jimmy Stewart-starring Hitchcock and The Manchurian Candidate. Then cap it off with Tom Cruise top-gunning down a winding mountainside road astride a motorcycle while his open shirt whips in the wind.  For grins throw in a little Get Smart.Every moments a climax. A much-ballyhooed sequence -- look thats actually Tom Cruise hanging off an actual airplane -- opens the film. Its over and done with before the audience has sipped its first soda almost like an afterthought. But why save anything when theres everything still to come? The plot is a genre staple Government spys once heralded as world-savers are branded as outlaws and sent into exile just as The Most Dangerous Villain Ever rises to power under the cover of myth and bureaucratic deniability. The good guys -- who wont take ""youre fired"" for an answer -- do good. The bad guys -- spearheaded by a creep in need of a throat lozenge (Sean Harris) who employs thought-dead ex-government assassins armed with assault rifles and bad aim -- do worse. And in between them all is the femme fatale (the excellent Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa because Casablanca) with murky allegiances that are actually pretty crystal-clear but lets just pretend OK?And theyre all looking for the same thing a USB drive.Writer-director Chris McQuarrie (who wrote and directed the bleak and hysterical The Way of the Gun after winning an Oscar for penning The Usual Suspect) embraces every clichA(c) like a long-lost lover the assassination attempt at the opera (Turandot in this case) the car chase through Moroccan back alleys the breath-holding underwater file-swap the encrypted computer disc that can only be opened with a retinal scan and the British prime ministers recitation of some Rudyard Kipling. And standing flexing sweating running and gunning at the center of this shiny chaos is a 53-year-old man 19 years into a franchise he kickstarted Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt sneeringly referred to by his boss as ""the living manifestation of destiny."" That lands as a punch line when delivered by the great Alec Baldwin who even as the CIA boss is still doing 30 Rocks Jack Donaghy. Ethan Hunt and Daniel Craigs Bond have morphed into the same character at this late date bitter betrayed weary burdened by loss and anguish and regret. For both the spy games lost its luster; killing people just isnt as fun as it used to be when your superiors aiming a sniper rifle at the back of your neck (again).Beyond the ever-escalating pile of dollar bills Cruise was wise to resurrect the TV show and turn into an Imax franchise. In the MI series he gets to play Ethan with an actual emotional arc -- from fresh(ish)-faced buzz-cut whiz kid in Film No. 1 to husband in entry three to exiled Cold Warrior. Were having tons of fun; but Ethan looks like he stopped enjoying himself right around the time Film 4s director Brad Bird turned him into Coyote and Road Runner. But thats the joke Ethans the humorless leader of a band of super buddies who might as well be named Scotty (Simon Pegg now with a blessedly amped-up role) Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames of whom theres never enough) and Not Jason Bourne (Jeremy Renner again wasted). The man doesnt crack a smile. This is serious business ... well big business anyway.Assume the next Mission Impossible will be even bigger. And louder. Goes Well With...

(David James/Paramount Pictures) Preposterous playful and shamelessly entertaining ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" obeys the first rule of action thrillers-cum-star vehicles Take this all too seriously and youre dead meat. Tom Cruise who delivers a Dorian Gray-like performance in his fifth outing as the Impossible Mission Forces Ethan Hunt knows this in his preternaturally uncreaky bones. Starting things off with an impressively realistic stunt hanging off the side of an ascending airplane -- which he performed himself according to pre-opening publicity -- Cruise strides through ""Rogue Nation"" with the combination of swagger and winking self-deprecation that have helped make him one of Hollywoods most enduring and dang it lovable screen products. Just when viewers are about to give into full eye roll -- when he displays the perfectly sculpted chest that his contract apparently stipulates he bare in every movie say or lays one of his penetrating Blue Steel looks on the baddie du jour -- he delivers a perfectly timed pratfall or handsomely dim retort. [The 2015 Summer Movie Guide] Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie who worked with Cruise on the far grittier ""Jack Reacher"" is just as canny as Cruise himself when it comes to deploying his lead actor. ""Rogue Nation"" turns out to be a fleet well-crafted effortlessly stylish addition to the ""Mission Impossible"" canon in which outlandish derring-do risibly arcane stakes and a woefully overlong running time are leavened by an endearing sense of humor that at times approaches high camp. The joshing tone of the most recent installments was securely established when Simon Pegg joined the force in 2006. With Alec Baldwin in the mix -- as a peevish CIA director eager to strip the IMF of its unchecked powers -- ""Rogue Nation"" goes deep meta. When Baldwin utters ""Hunt"" in a pivotal scene near the end of the film what might have been a moment where the wheels come off instead attains deadpan silkiness of Donaghy-esque proportions. Tom Cruise returns as agent Ethan Hunt for his most challenging mission yet. Hunt and his team are tasked with eliminating the Syndicate a highly-skilled international rogue organization committed to destroying the IMF. (  / Paramount Pictures) The great strength of McQuarrie is that even when hes leaning into the laughs he plays it straight -- he doesnt sacrifice inviolable core values in the name of escapism whether in the form of smart writing or superb production aesthetics. Handsomely photographed by Robert Elswit ""Rogue Nation"" possesses the sleek globe-trotting feel weve come to expect from the James Bonds and Jason Bournes of the world. What distinguishes this iteration is a classical sensibility that feels almost like a throwback like 007 before he went techno-ballistic. The spine of the plot touches on such topical tropes as computer hacks government transparency and global terrorism. But the set pieces are pure old school from the films eyeball-grabbing opening number and a Hitchcockian fight staged during ""Turandot"" on a backstage catwalk to a beautifully executed underwater bit and a motorcycle-car chase that must have struck co-star Jeremy Renner as dimly familiar from his stint in the Bourne universe. Through it all Cruise maintains the signature focus and physical cool that weve come to expect even if Ethan has become a little unhinged in his righteous lone-wolf fury (""unhinged"" being yet another beat Cruise can pluck easily from his emotional tool box). Whats more as he did in the criminally under-seen ""Edge of Tomorrow"" Cruise once again chooses for Ethan to work with a female counterpart who rather than a stock lady-in-jeopardy or erotic love interest is just as competent and physically courageous as he is. (In a clever twist its Peggs dweeby character Benji who emerges as ""Rogue Nations"" damsel in distress.) Indeed as much as Cruise dominates ""Rogue Nation"" its his co-star Rebecca Ferguson who emerges as the films true and most memorable revelation. A dazzling auburn-haired Swedish beauty she embodies the glamour and elan of a modern-day Diana Rigg or ""Edge of Tomorrows"" Emily Blunt. Like Blunt Ferguson manages to be sexy strong complicated and enigmatic in a performance that Cruise highlights by way of his own reflected persona. It may not entail hanging off the side of a moving airplane but its a pretty gutsy and admirable stunt nonetheless free of vanity and brimming with the secure unfussy confidence of a true star. 1 of 62 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Four-star movies View Photos Caption Captain Fantastic Viggo Mortensen stars as a father raising six children in the forest in ""Captain Fantastic.""

"Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation review Best of the series - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation review Best of the series Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson Chiabella James / Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions via AP Rebecca Ferguson left and Tom Cruise appear in a scene from ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation."" Rebecca Ferguson left and Tom Cruise appear in a scene from ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation."" (Chiabella James / Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions via AP) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The thinking persons mindless entertainment. With the new ""Mission Impossible"" movie even if its the most assured and satisfying of the five so far it sounds foolish to even mention the things the characters say in between screeching tires gunfights knife fights motorcycle derring-do and the opening act featuring Tom Cruise dangling for real (real enough to make it look cool and frightening) on the outside of a plane high over a Belarus airstrip.But it isnt foolish. One of the many pleasures of ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" is the snap and tension of writer-director Christopher McQuarries dialogue. At one point a character describes Cruises Ethan Hunt as an unstoppable force of destiny in such wittily florid terms its like a love letter crossed with a term paper dropped into a spy movie. McQuarrie won an Oscar for the highly verbal ensemble foray ""The Usual Suspects."" Then for a long while his Hollywood career cooled. Now its hot again thanks to Cruise who hired McQuarrie for ""Jack Reacher"" and then to rewrite the troubled (and ultimately entertaining) science fiction thriller ""Edge of Tomorrow."" As a storyteller McQuarrie is smart enough to treat each character as the smartest person in any given room in his or her own way. Even the disposable goons in ""Rogue Nation"" are rewarded with a line or two betraying some verifiable human intelligence before they get scissor-kicked in the face.McQuarrie joins the tony list of ""Mission Impossible"" directors past Brian De Palma John Woo J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird. His facility for straight-up relatively traditional violent action takes on a new swagger in ""Rogue Nation."" He has a mind and an eye for intricate setups and if the results arent quite in the realm of movie heaven (the editing by Eddie Hamilton sometimes devolves into chaos) neither do they settle for generic head-bashing. As photographed in rich gleaming light and shadow in London Vienna and Casablanca by the great cinematographer Robert Elswit Oscar winner for ""There Will Be Blood"" the showcase scenes -- such as a lengthy ""Man Who Knew Too Much""-inspired assassination attempt inside the Vienna State Opera House -- hark back to swank consciously ""exotic"" Cold War thrillers in the locales as well as the spirit. The super-secret espionage agency known as the Impossible Mission Force becomes de-funded in ""Rogue Nation"" by the grumpy competitive CIA director played by Alec Baldwin lightening the load with extraordinarily dry line readings. This leaves Hunt and the gang without the leeway they need to capture the vicious head of an international terrorist syndicate known expediently as The Syndicate.Sean Harris whose vocal intonations suggest a lifetime of cigarettes and helium intake is genuinely chilling as Hunts quarry. The IMF crew familiar and welcome faces all includes Jeremy Renner Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames. Rebecca Ferguson Swedish-born makes a formidable addition to the team (sub-group ""frenemy"") in the role of a British spy working every side of every street with her mad fighting skills and inevitable if extremely cautious interest in Cruises Hunt. ""Rogue Nation"" has only a fleeting theoretical interest in sex. Its more interested in Cruise running or Cruise leaping or Cruise holding his breath underwater for a long time in a genuinely tense tour-de-force. Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation clip Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation Clip Shoes (ScreenPlay) Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation Clip Shoes (ScreenPlay) See more videos The IMF oversight committee cites ""wanton brinksmanship"" as the reason for closing down the ""throwback"" that is the IMF. ""Rogue Nation"" revels in both those qualities. Its daring of McQuarrie in a big-budget internationally financed action picture such as this to turn over a fair amount of narrative acreage to a lengthy methodical scene cutting between a performance of Puccinis ""Turandot"" and not one not two but three assassins lurking in the opera house wings. Other filmmakers wouldve condensed such a sequence down to a couple of minutes; this one presumes a little patience on the audiences behalf. Lest we mistake ""Rogue Nation"" for Graham Greene theres a Moroccan car chase leading into a motorcycle chase leading into a telling moment of betrayal.Cruise clearly has a death wish judging from how he throws himself into Mission Improbable stunts every time out. The opening gambit with the plane recalls Sean Connery atop the moving locomotive in the 70s adventure ""The Great Train Robbery."" For whatever sick reason we enjoy seeing our stars in some degree of actual physical peril. Half of ""Rogue Nation"" belongs to the digital realm of trickery; the other half delivers a more gratifying combination of bodies in space usually going at each other along with crosses double-crosses and settings reminiscent of everything from the 1966-1973 TV show to Hitchcock to Stanley Donens ""Charade."" As for Lalo Schifrins famous 5/4 theme -- one of the greatest of all ""danger"" themes in TV or the movies -- well theres cool. And then theres ""Theme from Mission Impossible"" cool.

Pegg in fact gets an unofficial promotion. For large portions of the film he and Cruise might as well be in their own buddy pic. (Cruise gets to do the cool stunts; Pegg gets to make snappy comments about said stunts.) That leaves underutilized Renner in the Washington D.C. headquarters for far too long. An alluring femme fatale raises the intrigue quotient. Newcomer Rebecca Ferguson plays a mysterious British agent who may or may not belong to the dark side and may or may not want to aid Hunt. She keeps up with Cruise in the most tenuous of actions sequences. Paula Patton we barely knew ye. PHOTOS Tom and Katie Holmes -- the way they were Jeremy Renner and Ving Rhames in Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation Christian Black If youve seen any of the first four movies -- heck even if you only know that dynamite theme -- then youre aware that this mighty motley crew isnt just going to sit in a room and talk strategy. (Which is fine as the plot doesnt quite hold up.) They chase they shoot they hack they do that cool neck-snap-with-the-legs move. And once again Hunt shows super-human resilience jumping from bullet sprays to oxygen-depriving feats underwater. Though not even Marvel superheroes can withstand this kind of punishment this isnt the kind of movie in which to quibble about the realism of the death-defying acts. Just marvel. (Lowercase m.) Indeed this is smart and satisfying summer entertainment. One harrowing set piece in which Cruise and a villain go at it on the rafters during a performance at the Vienna opera house is fantastically executed. Nothing may ever recapture the thrilling sight of Cruise hanging on wires from a ceiling trying desperately not to let a bead of sweat drip down from his eyeglasses but give credit to writer-director Christopher McQuarrie Its been almost 20 years since that original showstopper and he still manages to keep the espionage fresh. PHOTOS Stars rewear their most iconic costumes It all goes by in a whirl though and theres a good chance it will dissipate from memory as quickly as a message that self-destructs.

Its one of the best wide-release movies of the summer.  | 1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune July 30 2015 -- 1054am Paramount Pictures Tom Cruise appears in a scene from ""Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint One of the many talents of Tom Cruise is the ability to elevate a ho-hum movie format into a goodie box of creative surprises. To me thats a skill that even tops doing his own stunts. Cruise has sometimes been a cocky 7 out of 10 as a performer but as a movie-developing producer hes dependably a 9.5. His ""Mission Impossible"" series has transformed traditional action espionage into high-concept team stories with a crew of clever protagonists snappy dialogue and gravity-defying stunts. The new edition ""Rogue Nation"" is immersive unpredictable and crammed with more sharp plot hooks than a fishing basket. Its one of the best wide-release movies of the summer. Over 19 years -- a term far beyond the longevity of any Bond star -- Cruise has played undercover agent Ethan Hunt like a dashing freshman on campus. In his 50s now his charisma and physicality are still good as new. Hunts ageless charm never seems to reach beyond his closest Impossible Missions Force allies though. The units spotty track record in saving the world has the CIA (led with tongue-in-cheek smarm by Alec Baldwin) trying to disband the IMF in secretive U.S. Senate meetings. Under investigation Hunt is forced to abandon Simon Peggs anxious tech wizard Benji Ving Rhames icewater cool Luther and Jeremy Renners analytical Brandt. Those are badly timed farewells since a global threat called the Syndicate is about to launch an international splatterfest that only Hunt and his associates can confront. ""Rogue Nation"" takes us from Belarus to Morocco to London where Hunt clings to vehicles moving at redline speed. Now hes hanging onto a transport plane taking off now screeching sideways in a wheel-smoking BMW now racing alongside a dozen enemies in a lethal game of motorcycle chicken. Cruise doesnt put on airs of berserk strength and invulnerability. One of the films funny touches is seeing Hunt survive each new catastrophe just barely. Bo Bridges Paramount Pictures Tom Cruise appears in a scene from ""Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation."" Hes not always pushed to the edge of death by hand-to-hand combat. Often he goes there himself. An instant after a near-drowning he motors across Casablanca with a comically worried Benji in the passenger seat. ""Sure youre OK to drive?"" Benji bleats. ""A minute ago you were dead."" How nice to have a hero with no superpowers just skills and courage. Christopher McQuarrie Cruises creative partner on ""Valkyrie"" ""Jack Reacher"" and ""Edge of Tomorrow"" handles both the script and direction with stylish spin. You cant guess where the mystery is headed scene to scene but everything makes sense. The film has a sophisticated feel introducing an unidentified unpredictable femme fatale who could be Hunts ally or archenemy. Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson is vibrant in the role standing out here like Charlize Theron did in ""Mad Max."" Ferguson earns our support whether shes outfoxing the IMF the weirdly reserved Syndicate nemesis played by Sean Harris or Simon McBurneys manipulative MI6 chief (the films bad guys are all British as marmalade). Her eyes shining with intelligence Ferguson is a performing equal to Cruise. To orchestrate the emotional tension between the characters McQuarrie repeats the glorious ""Turandot"" theme we first encounter in a Hitchcock-style assassination at the Vienna opera house. Even the films musical motifs are swanky. Baldwins CIA bulldozer spends most of the running time trying to pull the plug on the IMFs adventures but not many viewers will agree. Theyre Tom terrific. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

(Chiabella James/Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions via AP) David James In this image released by Paramount Pictures Tom Cruise portrays Ethan Hunt in a scene from ""Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation."" (David James/Paramount Pictures and Skydance Productions via AP) Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is used to accepting missions that in hindsight he might have been better off declining. In his line of work theres not much room -- or time -- for second-guessing. Jumping into uncertain situations is all part of being a spy.But Hunt isnt quite prepared when he finds himself the target of an organization that hed expect to be his ally the CIA whose chief Alan Huntley (Alec Baldwin) takes issue with his handling of the Impossible Missions Force and is determined to neutralize him. In short order Hunts colleagues Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are under Huntleys thumb -- and Hunt is on the run.The IMFs dismantling couldnt come at a worse time. Hunt has discovered a network of rogue agents called the Syndicate who have embraced a terrorist agenda under the leadership of the merciless and methodical Lane (Sean Harris). But the CIA insists the threat doesnt exist. Hunts efforts to defeat the Syndicate depend on working with the IMF including erstwhile teammate Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) on the sly -- and enlisting the help of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) a British agent who may or may not be trustworthy.The fifth installment in the spy franchise inspired by a classic television series ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" is a thrillingly entertaining follow-up to 2011s hugely successful ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol."" While delivering the kind of action that fans of the big-screen series expect writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (""Jack Reacher"") also raises questions about the role of espionage in an era of shifting geopolitical allegiances. Cruise is as watchable as ever bringing to Hunt a blend of steeliness and vulnerability. But hes almost upstaged by Ferguson whose intriguingly charismatic Ilsa deserves her own movie. And Pegg makes the most of his significantly enhanced role.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Ethan Hunt is a secret agent. He works with a team of high-tech specialists to save the world from terrorists. Often their work involves dangerous physical feats performed under tight time constraints. That folks is about all the backstory you need to know to successfully enjoy Mission Impossible--Rogue Nation--or for that matter any of the four other entries in this blockbuster movie series that was once a blockbuster television series. As Hollywood continues to build franchises on top of franchises turning the summer movie season into a massive crossover event the MI films remain blessedly unfashionably self-contained Theyre stand-alone popcorn entertainments that can be watched in any order with only the thinnest of connecting continuity between them. Who needs a post-credits tease for next summers sequel when you have the pre-credits spectacle of Tom Cruise really truly actually dangling from an airplane on its way to the sky?Thats the first but definitely not the last daredevil challenge the star accepts in this locomotive fifth installment another relentless dose of espionage escapism. Cruise now 53 still approaches each new Mission as though it were an elaborate game of truth or dare (he never picks truth) channeling his couch-jumping madman enthusiasm into insanely gutsy (or just plain insane) stunt work. Rogue Nation puts his protagonist aging agent Ethan Hunt through the globe-hopping wringer and the conflation of real and fictional exertion--thats not just the character but also the actor taking a 150-foot plunge or holding his breath for minutes on end--gives the action a charge of authenticity. What this divisive celebrity headliner seems to understand is that hes never more likable than when risking life and limb for our perverse enjoyment.Christopher McQuarrie understands that too. He was one of three credited screenwriters on last summers Cruise vehicle the tragically underperforming Edge Of Tomorrow whose eccentric appeal was built at least partially on the sight of its star dying over and over again. McQuarrie who previously directed Cruise in Jack Reacher and won an Oscar for penning The Usual Suspects was handpicked by the actor to write and direct Rogue Nation. His chief contribution here is keeping the odds preposterously stacked against our hero whos forced to go off the grid when the government--in the latest setback for the Impossible Mission Force an organization that seems to be in a perpetual state of near-collapse--pulls the plug on his operations. Chased by a bloviating CIA bigwig (Alec Baldwin gamely spouting angry-police-chief buzzwords like ""unorthodox"") Hunt crisscrosses the planet in pursuit of a shadow terrorist group called The Syndicate. A kind of ""anti-IMF"" its staffed by supposedly dead agents from other intelligence divisions. Their leader (Sean Harris) is a bespectacled raspy-voiced anarchist pragmatic to an inhuman fault. Hes like Steve Jobs as played by Hannibal Lecter.Rogue Nation sometimes struggles to make productive use of its supporting agents--not so much comic-relief sidekick Benji (Simon Pegg) but certainly Brandt (Jeremy Renner) who spends most of the film running interference in the States and Luther (Ving Rhames) eventually recruited to track down their MIA leader. But thats partially because the movie needed to make room for a new hire a mysterious double agent played spectacularly by newcomer Rebecca Ferguson. Ilsa as shes called cuts a fierce femme-fatale figure making short work of goons and building an ambiguously romantic rapport with Hunt whos been stripped without explanation of the personal life Mission Impossible III provided him. The movie also supplies her with a real conflict a crisis of allegiance that syncs up well with Rogue Nations deeper concerns about the havoc intelligence work can wreak on moral compasses. Shes not just a fine sparring partner for Cruise but maybe the heart of the picture lending its terrific spy games some emotional stakes.Of course the true X-factors of these movies with their fairly interchangeable plots and nerve-jangling suspense sequences are the one-and-done directors at the helm. Rather than go full auteur on his formulaic material McQuarrie instead offers a kind of greatest hits package Rogue Nation marries the shifting loyalties of Brian De Palmas original to the kinetic action beats of John Woos series nadir and the all-set-piece structure of Brad Birds series zenith adding an omnipotent villain not far removed from the one Philip Seymour Hoffman played in J.J. Abrams entry. Its the least visually or conceptually distinctive of the five movies leaning on whats worked before rather than forging its own path.But if McQuarrie doesnt put as singular of a stamp on the MI brand as his predecessors did he proves himself more than qualified to run the control booth of a perpetual motion machine. Rogue Nation like the similarly propulsive Ghost Protocol often feels like a pure instrument of fun dragging Hunt through an ongoing series of precarious situations. Theres a crosscutting Hitchcockian skirmish in the rafters of the Vienna Opera House a tight motorcycle pursuit through heavy traffic and a heist sequence--a series specialty--in which Hunt must filch some sensitive data from a circular underwater vault dodging a rotating crane as his oxygen supply dwindles. McQuarrie mounts these sequences with playful booby-trap precision; in one particularly inspired moment a car blows up in the background of the shot seconds before Benji speeds a getaway vehicle into the foreground. Mostly though he just keeps the whole enterprise hurtling forward from one hit of pleasure to the next. Whoever occupies the directors chair of the next Mission Impossible movie would be wise to study his cut-the-fat approach. Thats assuming of course there is a next Mission Impossible movie. Please let there be a next Mission Impossible movie.

Movie review Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation Article Tweet Loading ... Paramount Paramount Paramount Paramount Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation     (out of five) Director Christopher McQuarrie Cast Tom Cruise Rebecca Ferguson Simon Pegg Rated PG-13 (sequences of action and violence brief partial nudity) Running time 131 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 308pm on Wednesday Jul. 29 2015 Wednesday Jul. 29 2015 Thursday Jul. 30 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The ""Mission Impossible"" franchise has a lot in common with Old Faithful its a popular summertime attraction; its predictable as clockwork; and features acts of nature -- a geyser of boiling water in one case Tom Cruises abs in the other -- that remain impressive after all these years. Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation the fifth installment in this reboot of the popular 60s TV spy series does nothing to undermine this assertion. While director Christopher McQuarrie ( Jack Reacher) has little new to add to the filmmaking formula he proves himself to be a talented recycler. Once again the secretive American agency known as the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) finds itself in the crosshairs this time from Congress. The head of the CIA (Alec Baldwin) wants the IMF brought to heel under his control meaning all the agents will be pulled from their assignments and the organization dismantled. But top agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his boss William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) have no intention of knuckling under as they think they are close to cracking the ruthless Syndicate a global terrorist organization bent on chaos and catastrophe. That the Syndicate happens to be run by a cold sinister European (Sean Harris The Borgias) makes it all the more nefarious.The result is that Hunt is a wanted man by both the Syndicate and CIA with only his trusty sidekicks -- including comic-relief Benji (Simon Pegg) no-nonsense Luther (Ving Rhames) and the leggy is-she-or-isnt-she-a-double-agent Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) -- as well as his lack of fear of heights speeding cars and whizzing bullets to guide him. MI fans go to these movies for the stunts in exotic locales and Rogue Nation has at least three winners. The much-talked-about scene with Cruise hanging from the outside of an ascending airplane takes place before the opening credits though it is outdone by two later set-pieces a masterful dance of action choreography and camera work set backstage and in the rafters of the Vienna Opera House while Turandot is being performed; and a dizzying motorcycle chase through the winding streets of Morocco.While it all may be literally downhill from there McQuarrie -- who also wrote the screenplay -- keeps things moving swiftly though at 131 minutes Rogue Nation does wear out its welcome by the end.Still what Rogue Nation does well is reinforce what a commanding action figure Cruise 53 has been for the last couple of decades. He received very little notice for one of last summers best action films the woefully underrated Edge of Tomorrow and Rogue Nation may be dismissed as just another sequel as cash grab. But Cruise can still bring the goods when it comes to this kind of summer spectacle.Just like Old Faithful.

"Review Tom Cruise and Mission Impossible Rogue Nation are best so far - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Tom Cruise and Mission Impossible Rogue Nation are best so farBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News CorrespondentPosted 07/29/2015 114347 AM PDTUpdated 08/01/2015 064834 AM PDT Related StoriesJul 30Is Rogue Nation the best of the Mission Impossible movies?When a franchise cranks out its fifth installment its no surprise if the treads on the tires start looking a little bald.Not so with the ""Mission Impossible"" series and ""Rogue Nation"" proves theres still plenty of fire in the tank to fuel ensuing sequels.The taut brain-twister is one of the best so far in this spy series based on a decades-old TV show. Its also one of the years top action films.While ""Rogue Nation"" cant quite match the creative spark that energized Brad Birds ""Ghost Protocol"" from 2011 it comes close. And love him or not the 53-year-old Tom Cruise makes an ideal Ethan Hunt the unstoppable leader of the Impossible Missions Force. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt Tom Cruise shooting as scene on the set of Mission Impossible a "" Rogue Nation. (Bo Bridges/Paramount Pictures) (Photo credit Bo Bridges) The franchise got off to a shaky start with its first couple of films because they couldnt find the right mix of brains and brawn. ""Rogue Nation"" on the other hand stands firmly confident never dragging and only going overboard with the action when warranted. OK maybe it does get cuckoo near the end but thats part of the fun.Director and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie redeems himself after he and Cruise floundered with 2012s lackluster crime story ""Jack Reacher."" Here he seems more assured and better equipped to choreograph spectacular action pieces. The opening segment with Hunt jumping atop a plane is breathtaking and that scene and a wild motorcycle chase in Morocco are among the many sweaty-palms-inducing showstoppers.Advertisement The difference is that the stunts never feel entirely disconnected from the twist-filled yet mostly logical storyline. This time around the IMF is battling a shadowy terrorist outfit called the Syndicate a rogue organization that none of the higher-ups appears to believe even exists. How to end the Syndicates tyranny is going to be tough since the IMF is being deactivated partly as a result of their perceived roles in past incidents including the Kremlin bombing in ""Ghost Protocol.""""Rogue Nation"" picks up shortly after the events in ""Protocol"" with CIA boss Allen Hunley (Alec Baldwin a most welcome addition) advocating to dissolve the group. Defending the IMF but not budging on divulging details is William Brandt (Jeremy Renner who joined the franchise in ""Ghost"" as the ""suit"" to Ethans action).The plot plays out like a James Bond flick with the team -- which includes the computer-savvy but comical Benji (Simon Pegg) and no-nonsense smart guy Luther (Ving Rhames) -- battling the bad guys. In one of my favorite parts Ethan and Benji wind up at the Vienna Opera House trying to stop possible mayhem during a ""Turandot"" performance. The scene recalls the best of Hitchcock and is one of many sequences that references classic films including ""Casablanca."" (L-R) Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa and Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt in Mission Impossible a "" Rogue Nation. (Chiabella James/Paramount Pictures) (Chiabella James/Paramount Pictur) ""Rogue"" also showcases Pegg and Cruise as a winning team. But all the actors play off each other with the ease of old friends leaning on Pegg and Rhames for doses of humor.Whats no laughing matter is the films villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris of ""Prometheus"" in a creepy low-key turn). He wants to see the IMF self-destruct and hes deploying a team to do that and more. He relies heavily on Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson of BBCs ""The White Queen"") whose duplicity helps Ethan get out of life-threatening pickles while tempting him in other ways.Ilsa is one of the best female characters in the entire series and Ferguson livens up the boys club making her one of the most intriguing female action characters in recent memory.The actors all slip into their roles as if they were custom tailored. For Cruise Ethan remains a perfect fit -- intense and a little crazy. But Cruise doesnt dominate ""Mission Impossible."" This is an ensemble effort.Overall ""Rogue Nation"" shows a clearer sense of purpose for the franchise and even opens it up for more than one star to power. After taking a few stabs at the right formula the series has finally found its voice and Ethan Hunt and company give James Bond a real run for his blockbuster money. mission impossible rogue nation    1/2Rating PG-13 (for sequences of action and violence and brief partial nudity)Cast Tom Cruise Jeremy Renner Simon Pegg Rebecca Ferguson Alec Baldwin Ving RhamesDirector and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrieRunning time 2 hours 11 minutes Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

EntertainmentMovies Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation brings the summer action Originally published July 30 2015 at 1205 am Updated July 30 2015 at 1115 am Tom Cruise returns as superspy Ethan Hunt in ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation."" (Bo Bridges) A review of ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" starring Tom Cruise as the irrepressible superspy Ethan Hunt. Rating 3 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic Superspy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) in the lively ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" demonstrates an impressive number of essential life skills. In short order he hangs off the edge of a plane outruns bullets holds his breath for a really long time demonstrates the balance of a skilled tightrope walker motorcycles without a helmet dangles high above an opera set while beating somebody up and (spoiler alert but not really) recovers from death. (You dont think this franchise would kill Ethan Hunt off do you?) Hes such a Renaissance man that during the disruption of said opera I found myself hoping hed hop onto the stage don a costume and pinch-hit for the tenor. This fifth edition of the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie is good popcorn-movie fun; watch it on the biggest screen you can find (I saw it on the Boeing IMAX at Pacific Science Center) and enjoy the zippiness. The plot doesnt matter at all in a movie like this; suffice to say that Hunt and his IMF colleagues Benji (Simon Pegg) Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Luther (Ving Rhames) after being disbanded for ""wanton brinkmanship and a total disregard for protocol"" must nonetheless save the world from a shady rogue nation called The Syndicate. Along the way theyre joined by slinky spy Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) whose true affiliation remains shadowy. McQuarrie structuring the film as a series of action set pieces in dazzling international locations keeps the pace taut. That opera sequence (set at the stunning Vienna State Opera House during a performance of ""Turandot"") in particular is a nail-biter with Puccinis music adding to the drama. (Has anyone in the movies ever been strangled to the tune of ""Nessun dorma"" before?) The cast is good fun particularly Pegg whose comic looseness helps balance Cruises well Cruise-ness. The Intense Tom Cruise Face -- you know the expression I mean where he looks like hes about to explode and/or start yelling but doesnt -- makes frequent appearances as does the trademark arm-chopping Tom Cruise Run. Movie Review    Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation with Tom Cruise Jeremy Renner Simon Pegg Rebecca Ferguson Ving Rhames Sean Harris Alec Baldwin. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. 125 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of action and violence and brief partial nudity. Several theaters. And Ferguson does well as a female badass quite capable of deftly punching the lights out of any man in the room. (Demonstrating that shes far smarter than her ""Jurassic World"" counterpart this chic adventurer shucks off her sky-high heels before running for her life.) Is it too much to ask in this supposed Summer of Female Heroines at the Multiplexes that someday a big-franchise action flick might have more than one token female with a speaking role? Just wondering. In the meantime pass the popcorn. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

"Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; mission-impossible-rogue-nation ) Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation (United States 2015) July 29 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli 2015 has been a banner year for action-oriented spy movies. One early entry Kingsman The Secret Service was a Valentine to 60s British titles. A similar claim could be made about the upcoming The Man from U.N.C.L.E. In November James Bond will be back in Spectre. Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation the fifth installment of the TV series-turned-motion picture franchise is American in origin but owes more than a small debt to the 007 movies from the Timothy Dalton/Pierce Brosnan era. Mission Impossible (the movie series) has improved markedly since its rocky start. Perhaps its that Tom Cruise has grown into the role of Ethan Hunt or perhaps its because the films by successfully distancing themselves from the TV inspiration have gained a life of their own. Whatever the reason this production joins its immediate predecessor Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol at the franchises pinnacle. Some of the narrative contortions are rather silly (although the same could be said about every 007 outing) but the steady level of suspense maintained by writer/director Christopher McQuarrie more than compensates. Rogue Nation stretches all the way back to the TV series for the villain. The Syndicate an evil ""mirror"" of the IMF was teased at the end of Ghost Protocol. Here it takes center stage under the leadership of a corrupt ex-British agent (played with steely antagonism by Sean Harris). Meanwhile Stateside CIA director Hunley (Alec Baldwin) succeeds in getting the IMFs charter revoked and having the agents absorbed into his organization. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) globetrotting in Europe chasing the Syndicate refuses to come in from the cold. He is soon joined in exile by Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and later by William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames). Hunts investigation leads him to the beautiful deadly Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) who alternately helps and betrays him causing him (and us) to question whether shes a British agent a double agent or a triple agent. Whatever one thinks of Tom Cruise as a person and celebrity theres no doubting his commitment to the Mission Impossible series. In installment 4 he clung to the Burj Khalifa. In Rogue Nation to top that stunt Cruise clambers around on the outside of an Airbus A400M without the benefit of special effects or a double. Although in many ways more daring than what he accomplished for the previous film the airplane walk is less central to the plot and seems superfluous. It may be the most spectacular scene offered by Rogue Nation but it is by no means the most tense. That distinction belongs to an underwater adventure a car and motorcycle chase or the final confrontation. The action moves through many countries stopping so briefly in some that we dont get a chance to sightsee. Filming was done in Vienna London and Casablanca with those locations representing themselves and sometimes standing in for others (Paris Cuba and the United States). McQuarries screenplay has perfected the flavor of late-80s/90s Bond - over-the-top action cars and gadgets and plenty of high-level corruption and double-crossing. The only element missing is a traditional ""Bond girl."" Rebecca Fergusons Ilsa is just as physically intimidating and lethal as Hunt. Shes more often the rescuer than the one in need of rescuing. And the films romantic angle never goes beyond a little simmering sexual friction. The movie brings back a few of the characters who have appeared alongside Hunt during the franchises 19-year run. Aside from Hunt the only other IMF member to appear in all five installments is Ving Rhames Luther. Hes a supporting character with minimal screen time here but his presence is welcome. Simon Pegg now in his third Mission Impossible gets a meaty part trailing only Cruise and Ferguson for screen time. And Jeremy Renner the only actor to feature in both the Mission Impossible and Jason Bourne franchises reprises his role from Ghost Protocol. Rogue Nation arrives in theaters at the tail-end of the summer season and its positioning may impact its ability to find an audience. Nevertheless the film offers everything one could ask for from popcorn entertainment and its brand of action feels fresher and more freewheeling than anything we have seen since Furious 7 kicked things off. The tone is predominantly serious but theres enough humor to keep things light. Hopefully the reception will be positive because on the strength of this outing a sixth big-screen impossible mission is warranted.

Photo Paramount Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation Running time 131 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence profanity). In the last couple of years Tom Cruise has made a smart detective film ""Jack Reacher"" that made no money plus a smart sci-fi film ""Edge of Tomorrow"" that made no money. ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" is a sigh of defeat. Now Toms only goal is to give us a kickboxing fight or a motorcycle chase every eight minutes and hope for the best. Tom Cruise (left) and Jeremy RennerPhoto Paramount Pictures Neither bad enough to be a complete waste of time nor good enough to remember past next Tuesday the film co-written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie staples together one routine action piece after another with cutesy dialogue and lots of merciless pounding away at iPad screens. The IMF (Impossible Mission Force) is in trouble with the CIA boss (Alec Baldwin) who wants to shut them down for chasing after what he believes is a fictitious international terror force dubbed the Syndicate that foments disaster worldwide Blame them for plane crashes civil wars and maybe even the script for ""Jupiter Ascending."" Tom CruisePhoto Paramount Pictures To unravel the Syndicate Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his IMF team (Simon Pegg Jeremy Renner Ving Rhames) will have to go off-grid (are they ever on-grid?) in search of ultimately a bank statement. This can be obtained only by diving into an underwater chamber to switch out a data card because I guess sensitive electronics gear works optimally under 10 billion gallons of H20 and also because diving scenes are cool. Especially if we know that Ethan will have to hold his breath under the wet stuff for three solid minutes if all goes perfectly which of course it will not. Is there a super-spy trick to this? No McQuarrie simply has Ethan be superhuman. Holding onto a flying jet with his fingertips at hundreds of miles an hour? No problem. Walking away from a 100-mph motorcycle wipeout? Yawn. Ethan even suffers brain damage at one point then shakes it off like its a gin and tonic. Superman thinks this guy is boringly infallible. Tom Cruise and Rebecca FergusonPhoto Paramount Pictures But even Superman had a girlfriend. Cruise seems to have given up on trying to convince us that hes a ladies man and with the female lead -- a fellow spy (Rebecca Ferguson) of uncertain loyalty -- he shares no moment sexier than a warm hug of the quality youd give your aunt at Thanksgiving. Lacking much character except (like everyone else here) expertise at all things she is on hand only to check the box marked ""Strong assertive female."" It would make no difference within the movie if she perished at the hands of the Syndicates creepy chief Lane (Sean Harris). Naming her Ilsa and having her hang out in Casablanca brings up the kinds of comparisons that can only be labeled unfortunate. ""Rogue Nation"" the kind of movie where trained assassins with machine guns miss our hero from a distance of five yards has the occasional semi-rousing moment but it has neither the wit of the best Bond films nor the grit of any of the Bourne ones. Its a movie that never lives up to the promise of its own theme song.

"Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation (PG-13) The fifth installment in Tom Cruises super-spy franchise is an absolute blast - for a while. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com7/29/2015 Editor rating 2.5 In Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation Tom Cruise runs faster fights harder and flies higher. At 53 the actor seems more intent than ever on cementing his beleaguered star power and he invests so much into his fifth outing as the tireless super-spy Ethan Hunt that he wins you over. For much of the films two hours you forget about the real-world Cruise and all the problematic baggage he carries and just marvel at his efforts even if they bear a whiff of desperation. Yes thats really Cruise hanging off the side of an airplane in the stupendous prologue that opens the movie. Yes he really did have to hold his breath for long stretches during one of the films mammoth setpieces this one set underwater. And yes that really is Cruise hurtling through the streets of Morocco on a motorcycle roaring after the bad guys. There is evidence of CGI trickery everywhere but its never as distracting as the video-game artificiality of say Furious 7. Cruise and his frequent collaborator Christopher McQuarrie (who wrote Valkyrie and Edge of Tomorrow and also directed 2012s old-school Jack Reacher) adhere to the proven formula of the MI franchise Put the hero in a series of impossible over-the-top predicaments that look as real as possible then let Cruises clenched-jaw intensity sell the show (he always looks like hes under duress even when hes just talking on the telephone). Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation pays homage to the previous entries in the series. The opening credits duplicate the ones from the first installment directed by Brian De Palma in 1996 showing you the entire movie youre about to see in rapid-fire cuts set to Lalo Schifrins iconic score. McQuarrie also channels De Palma during an elegantly edited sequence involving an assassination attempt inside the Vienna Opera House during a live performance of Turandot although McQuarrie cant duplicate De Palmas rapturous nerve-shredding languors. Fallout from the events of the previous picture Brad Birds 2011 Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol leads to consequences. Alec Baldwin plays the CIA chief who decides to shut down Hunt and his band of IMF agents for all the collateral damage theyve caused around the world. Jeremy Renner Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames return as Hunts cohorts always watching his back (and with the exception of Pegg are given surprisingly little to do). Rebecca Ferguson is a fellow secret agent who is a physical and mental match for Hunt but in time-honored espionage-thriller fashion she may not be trustworthy. Sean Harris (Prometheus) plays the requisite maniacal villain Lane who speaks in a raspy whisper is prone to theatrical grandstanding and has amassed an international army of former secret agents intent on destroying the world or somesuch. In a movie like this the bad guys motivation is just a MacGuffin a narrative spine to provide an excuse for outrageous action and preposterous plot twists. For about 90 minutes or so Rogue Nation settles for that and the result is grandly exciting even if it never reaches the delirious heights of Ghost Protocol (or the emotional intensity of J.J. Abrams underrated Mission Impossible III which boasted the formidable Philip Seymour Hoffman as Cruises antagonist). But in the final half-hour McQuarrie makes a critical mistake He starts taking this enjoyable nonsense seriously. Suddenly this fleet nimble adventure -- which commented on the increasingly cannibalistic nature of modern-day covert government operations while making room for such intentionally hammy lines as ""Ethan Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny"" -- turns talky and morose. The dialogue no longer carries a tongue-in-cheek undertone (you feel sad watching the great Rhames forced to say ""If Lane gets his hands on that money were unleashing a terrorist superpower"" with a straight face). The action becomes smaller and more generic. The surprise use of the series trademark rubber masks is perfunctory and predictable. Even Pegg who had constantly leavened the film with humor is stripped of any opportunity to lighten the mood. Cruise follows suit his performance shifting into serious-drama mode as if he were back making Born on the Fourth of July or Rainman. You can see the fun seep out of the movie just as it should be building to a crescendo and its a bummer. Cruise remains an underrated versatile actor a victim of his own success his acting chops and daring overshadowed by his box-office popularity (Rock of Ages was atrocious yes but what Cruise did in that movie was an act of nutso bravery.) In Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation Cruise wants to have it both ways feeding the Hollywood blockbuster machine while trying to squeeze in respectability. The movie is better when its poking sly fun at Cruises superheroic screen persona (look at the expression on his face when Ethan realizes just how big the guy he must fight is) than when it asks you to buy into its far-fetched antics. Nobody wants a campy Mission Impossible picture but I dont think anyone wants to see a grave Mission Impossible either. A bolder choice would have been to see this often thrilling entertainment through to the overblown finale it deserved. Instead Rogue Nation becomes flat and self-important demanding that we take it at face value. Thats like asking you to treat a Road Runner cartoon as a nature documentary. Mission impossible indeed. Cast Tom Cruise Jeremy Renner Simon Pegg Rebecca Ferguson Ving Rhames Sean Harris Alec Baldwin. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie. A Paramount Pictures release. Running time 131 minutes. Bloodless but intense action violence. Playing at area theaters.

Director Christopher McQuarrie (211). PG-13 Violence strong language. Area theaters. ""Impossible"" is right. Tom Cruises fun new movie features the star hanging off an airplane walking away from car crashes and pulling off one insane stunt after another. Its almost unbelievable. But choose to accept it. Because ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" is the perfect summer action flick. Its full of attractive people gorgeous locations loathsome bad guys and a pounding score that ties it all together. This is what the ""Fast and Furious"" movies want to be and the Bond pictures used to. INSIDE TOM CRUISES DEATH-DEFYING PLANE-GRABBING STUNT IN MISSION IMPOSSIBLE - ROGUE NATION The story has the Impossible Mission Force in trouble with their bosses -- again -- while tracking a shadowy spy organization. Known as the Syndicate its a global group of former agents crashing airplanes in Asia and assassinating leaders in Europe. Why? Dont ask. One of the films few problems is coming up with a real motive for this gang and its leader a mysterious master spy racking up the frequent flyer miles -- and always staying one step ahead of Cruises Ethan Hunt. But thats OK because the unflappable charismatic Cruise is back and doing what he does best -- flashing a smile running at the camera and looking great while things explode behind him. Sure in the gossip pages he comes off as an oddball. At best. But on the big IMAX screen hes still a pure true movie star. Tom Cruise leans in as Ethan Hunt in ""Mission Impossible."" (Paramount Pictures) Tom Cruise and Jeremy Renner as William Brandt in ""Mission Impossible"" (David James) Tom Cruise is brought into CIA headquarters in ""Mission Impossible."" (PARAMOUNT PICTURES) Also returning is Simon Pegg as Benji his geeky hacker helper and tight-lipped teammates Ving Rhames and Jeremy Renner. Alec Baldwin shows up too as the peevish CIA chief out to shut down Hunt and his buddies and scowls at everyone as if they put too much water in his Dewars. They all play perfectly their roles as hero sidekick or mean boss. The breakout star is Rebecca Ferguson as a slinky double agent. Or is that triple? She seems to change her allegiance more often than her drop-dead gowns. But Ferguson makes her formidable even if the romantic scenes with Cruise give off more smoke than fire. Rebecca Ferguson dazzles with costume changes in ""Mission Impossible."" (David James) Simon Pegg as Benji in ""Mission Impossible"" (David James) Rebecca Ferguson plays Ilsa in Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation from Paramount Pictures and Skydance Production (David James) Guiding all this is director Christopher McQuarrie who co-wrote the movie and keeps it moving well. He first hit with his script for ""The Usual Suspects"" and has been the go-to scribe for Cruise for years writing ""Valkyrie"" ""Jack Reacher"" and ""The Edge of Tomorrow"" and directing ""Reacher"" as well. McQuarrie shamelessly steals a big scene from Hitchcocks ""The Man Who Knew Too Much."" Hes smart enough though to amp up the tension by having multiple assassins instead of just one. The other solid setpieces have Cruise diving parachuting fighting and running. Always running. McQuarrie avoids the urge to end each action event with a cheap quip. 1 photos view gallery Stars hit the red carpet for the Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation premiere When its all over the movie pulls off the smartest trick of all. You leave feeling like you found a film that gave you your moneys worth. These days that can seem like the most impossible mission of all. ON A MOBILE DEVICE? WATCH THE VIDEO HERE.

Slideshow Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation High-speed hijinks more business than fun Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation >> ""Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny"" he proclaims. This is quite a statement - and quite an about-face for Baldwins CIA Director Hunley who for most of the movie has been busy denouncing disavowing and trying desperately to disband Hunts Impossible Missions Force. The team of deep-cover ops - Simon Pegg as tech whiz Benji Dunn Ving Rhames as hacker extraordinaire Luther Stickell Jeremy Renner as agent-with-bags-under-his-eyes William Brandt - has been nothing but trouble. All sorts of ""wanton acts of mayhem"" as Baldwin puts it (hes full of pithy phrases) have been pinned on the IMF. Of course Hunt and his crew are not to blame. Theres a mysterious group called the Syndicate an ""anti-IMF"" bent on doing what evil masterminds and their nefarious henchfolk are wont to do rule the world and transfer billions of dollars of other peoples money into a secret bank account while theyre at it. Cue the Lalo Schifrin theme music DAH-di-duh-duh - Dah-di-dun-dun. Not nearly as much fun as its 2011 predecessor Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol which played like a live-action Road Runner movie Rogue Nation nonetheless does the job of moving Hunt and company around the globe (Minsk London Washington Havana Paris Vienna Casablanca) from one outlandish action set piece to the next. If youve seen the trailers then youve seen Cruise clutching the side door of a military cargo plane as it takes off hoping Benji can open the thing via laptop before Hunts ears pop. If youve seen the trailers then youve seen Cruise free-diving into 70000 gallons of pressurized water hoping he can hold his breath for three minutes while he switches a data card gizmo around. If youve seen the trailers then youve seen Cruise gunning a BMW motorcycle along Moroccan roadways hoping he doesnt skid out while leaning into the turns at 120 m.p.h. (Hes not wearing a helmet either.) A trailer though runs for two minutes-plus. The movie runs for two hours-plus. Theres just a lot more of everything - too much actually. Theres a difference between velocity and momentum and while the chases shootouts and close quarters combat rarely flag our interest does. Christopher McQuarrie the Oscar-winning screenwriter of The Usual Suspects has worked with Cruise thrice before - he scripted the Nazi drama Valkyrie and the sci-fi war pic Edge of Tomorrow and directed Cruise in the franchise wannabe Jack Reacher. In Rogue Nation McQuarries attention to the intricacies of the plot and the choreography of the action get the better of him - and of the film. Its like an elaborate audition reel to get him a job directing the next James Bond. But McQuarrie has hired an amazing cinematographer Robert Elswit and you cant say Rogue Nation doesnt look good. McQuarrie also has hired Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson (the Starz miniseries The White Queen) as British espionage ace Ilsa Faust. It takes a while to figure out where Ilsas allegiances lie (double agent? triple agent? quadruple agent?) but she and Hunt get to rappel from the roof of the Vienna Opera House and roar up the switchbacks of the Atlas Mountains together. They make a nice couple. And she has a mean leg-whipping headlock thing going too. Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation 1/2 (Out of four stars) Directed by Christopher McQuarrie.

Simon Pegg plays Ethan Hunts nervous sidekick Benji in ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation."" Photo David James Associated Press Mission Impossible Cruise at his relentless best 1 / 3 Back to Gallery The force of will -- not nature but human will -- that we call Tom Cruise gets a serious workout in ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" and its an impressive thing to witness. First of all the man has stopped aging and no one even thinks thats weird. He is 53 but seems to have stopped the clock at 35 and if he keeps this up for another five years it will be time to either call in scientists or start speculating about Lucifer. His acting is also an act of will. Cruise brings a conviction to his scenes here that is partly the characters but mostly its as if he keeps repeating ""I am Tom Cruise and I am going to fill your mind with this very important thing I am about to say."" And everything he says is important. He has a scene with Simon Pegg in which hes incredibly intense and one can hardly imagine why. And then Pegg is intense right back at him not because that makes any sense but because Pegg has entered Cruise Land where all the molecules start vibrating because Tom is in the room. Cruises entrance in this fifth installment of the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise is particularly memorable. His colleagues in the Impossible Mission Force are trying to figure out how to ground a terrorist airplane before it takes off bearing enough nerve gas to choke a major city. Suddenly from out of nowhere Cruise appears -- should I really say ""Ethan Hunt""? -- and hes running toward the plane. His colleagues didnt even know he was in town. He just shows up jumps onto the wing and hangs from the door as the plane takes off. You can write the rest of the scene yourself. The old rule was that action heroes past the age of 47 or 48 enter a geriatric phase at which point audiences stop thinking ""This guy sure knows how to fight"" and start thinking ""Why does Dad keep on beating up people?"" But Cruise is writing his own rules. This time as always he leaps from tall buildings rides a motorcycle like a carnival daredevil and takes numerous punches and falls without it ever once crossing any viewers mind that this might be a strain for him. Of course Ethan Hunt is straining all over the place but Tom Cruise has got this. Incidentally this may be the first ""Mission Impossible"" movie in which Cruises real height (5 feet 7) is a factor in the fight scenes. Usually the movies try to create the illusion that Cruise is at least two or three inches taller but in several places here the disparity in size between him and his opponents becomes something else he must overcome. This is Cruises only new concession to physical reality and its a refreshing one. This time Ethan Hunt and his team are fighting everybody. A diabolical terrorist syndicate run by a soft-spoken maniac (Sean Harris) is on the verge of acquiring enough working capital to act as a kind of mobile rogue nation. Meanwhile the new CIA director (a sneering Alec Baldwin) shuts down the Impossible Mission Force because he thinks theyre a bunch of cowboys operating without oversight. Which is not exactly untrue. Christopher McQuarrie who wrote and directed previously wrote and directed ""Jack Reacher"" which wasnt much. But here McQuarrie devises a film thats a succession of riveting sequences filmed in a way thats active and yet elegant. The camera keeps moving within shots but not in a subjective jittery way but rather like a third-person narrator calmly emphasizing the essential points. Cruise who produced the film pairs himself well in ""Mission."" For most of the movie he shares the screen with Pegg who is appealing as his nervous sidekick. He is also paired or at least contrasted with Harris villain who is as laid-back as Cruise is relentless. Thats the only way a villain has a chance against Cruise to suggest a judo situation in which all the heros energy will be turned against him. Best of all Cruise is paired with Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa an enigmatic mystery woman who might be good and might be bad. Either way Fergusons aura of gravity -- the way she seems to read Cruise and take him seriously -- prevents us from seeing him as flighty. She is nothing like a Bond girl yet another thing in this entertaining movies favor. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Each installment in the series seems to showcase at least one top-this set piece where Cruise takes his life into his hands as if he were out to prove that theres still one old-school A-lister whos willing to go to the daredevil extremes that his peers pawn off on their stunt doubles. In the previous chapter 2011s Ghost Protocol Cruise wowed audiences by hanging from the side of the worlds tallest skyscraper Dubais Burj Khalifa with the help of a pair of electrified adhesive gloves. Now in the latest sequel Mission Impossible-Rogue Nation director Christopher McQuarrie understands that Cruises signature without-a-net show-stopper is what were all primed for. And he wastes no time serving it up opening the film with its biggest money shot as Cruise sprints and leaps onto the wing of a Russian cargo plane speeding down a Minsk runway and proceeds to cling by his fingernails onto its side after its taken flight. As he gets violently sucked into its hull (in a natty suit no less) and parachutes out with a payload of bombs laced with VX nerve gas all you can do is pick your jaw off your lap and grin at the breathtakingly bananas spectacle youve just witnessed. Because make no mistake about it even at 53 Cruise is still Hollywoods hungriest leading man. Regardless of whatever off-screen P.R. briar patches or on-screen missteps Cruise has weathered over the past decade the Mission Impossible films have remained the actors safe harbor--his Teflon franchise. Hell always be embraced as a returning hero as Ethan Hunt. Maybe thats because its one of the few remaining series (along with 007) where slick globe-trotting derring-do is still appreciated. Rogue Nation may not be the best the tightest or even the most logically coherent MI flick but there should be more movies like it relentlessly thrilling smart entertainments for folks who cant tell the difference between Quicksilver and The Flash--and arent particularly interested in trying to learn the difference either. After Rogue Nations opening salvo we quickly learn that these are dire times for Hunt and his top-secret IMF posse (Jeremy Renner Ving Rhames and the comic-relief maestro Simon Pegg). The U.S. government egged on by Alec Baldwins CIA heavy have gotten tired with Hunts cavalier brand of espionage and have called for their retirement. Of course theyre not about to start taking golf lessons without one last mission. Fortunately ones provided thanks to a rogue terrorist organization called The Syndicate led by a somewhat bland villain named Solomon Lane (Prometheus Sean Harris). While on the run from the CIA a spy in the cold Hunt is captured by Lanes henchmen and rescued from a beating by a beautiful Syndicate badass named Ilsa (Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson) who quickly slips away from Hunt and hightails it to Casablanca. Ilsa? Casablanca? Somewhere the Humphrey Bogart Estate awaits its royalties. Can Ilsa be trusted to work both sides against the middle while Hunt and his crew work their way up the Eurobaddie food chain to Lane and clear their names back at home? Cruises franchise is too valuable to Paramount to ever put that question in doubt. But like all Mission Impossible films (of which theres yet to be a dud) its not so much about the outcome as it is the breathlessly thrilling journey Cruise takes us on to get there.

By now the very idea of an auteur-driven blockbuster sounds downright quaint. While veterans John Woo J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird all had the chance to leave a mark on the franchise with fifth installment ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" relative newcomer Christopher McQuarrie trades ambition for competent action and typically charismatic worldly spies but little in the way of fresh ideas -- about as much as one can expect these days. McQuarries screenwriting career stretches back to ""The Usual Suspects"" but his directing career is comparatively young with only two previous credits to his name 2000s ""The Way of the Gun"" and 2012s ""Jack Reacher"" which like the ""Mission Impossible"" movies bolstered Tom Cruises status as a movie star against dwindling odds. With ""Rogue Nation"" for which McQuarrie holds the sole screenwriting credit the filmmaker delivers an enjoyable globe-trotting journey featuring Cruises clandestine government agent Ethan Hunt this time faced with the threat of obliteration. Not that any diehard fans should be too worried. The stakes of the story reflect an occasion as inevitable as Hunts exploding messages -- namely that ""Mission Impossible"" has arrived at the standard point in a series where its entire future comes into question. Assailed by a hawkish CIA director (Alec Baldwin distractingly on gruff autopilot) for their unruly tactics the Impossible Missions Force is shut down just as Hunt picks up on a shadowy crime organization in the UK that calls itself The Syndicate. Evading their capture he covertly agrees with team leader William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) to go underground and continue the mission. The premise is virtually a dare for the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise itself Ethan goes rogue to prove hes still got plenty of fight left in him. That eventually leads him to bring along smarmy computer expert Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg wide-eyed and hilarious as usual)  while scowling IMF ally Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) throws the occasional assist. Along the way Hunt also encounters slick British spy Ilsa (an icy Rebecca Ferguson) whose allegiances are continually called into question. With his merry band of tech-savvy espionage pros watching his back Hunt launches into swiftly paced set of set pieces most notably a daring backstage showdown with would-be assassins at the Vienna opera involving dangling platforms and guns disguised as instruments. Theres also an unnerving underwater sequence involving key cards and a rapid motorcycle chase through the dusty roads of Casablanca. But despite all of these enjoyable digressions ""Rogue Nation"" has fairly humble ambitions recycling old devices like absurdly convincing face masks and clever set-ups that no longer feel all that surprising. As a central threat The Syndicate holds some contemporary weight its murky intentions pitched somewhere between the NSA and ISIS. At the end of the day however its just a standard-issue MacGuffin designed to set the stage for ample tension and fast-paced routines. They dont disappoint but as a whole the entire endeavor has started to show signs of tedium. Weve come a long way since a single bead could play the chief vessel of suspense in a mainstream narrative. Instead theres Cruise in a CGI-enabled underground water tank struggling to hold his breath for three minutes while dodging huge churning machinery; elsewhere he grasps the edge of an airplane during takeoff before bursting through its doors. These physically daring stunts are certainly a lot of fun but hardly offer much in the way of the memorable inventive storytelling that turns Hunts absurd feats into relatable endeavors. Instead ""Rogue Nation"" plays out like a sufficient rejigging of the same variables tossed around many times before which is just enough to both celebrate the material and demonstrate its limitations. Of course that may be beyond McQuarrie and Cruises formidable efforts. While the ""Mission Impossible"" series may no longer feel fresh it also shows no signs of self-destructing anytime soon. Grade B ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" opens nationwide on July 31.

Cruise like Arnold strive for life instilled action (making look real be keeping it as real as you can/ like Arnold shooting the real 50 smg or carrying a dummy weighted at 300 lbs) Cruise tries his hand at the stunts. Each movie is as much an Evil Knievel stunt show as a thrilling action hellride. Although Cruise has landed on peoples bad sides for his off seeming ways lately ( like making people realize they are doping their kids with amphetamine like Ritalin etc yet cops put dare posters up showing me the is bad...or even the Oprah incident of which he got all crazy...yet what old man poking a teen wouldnt be exhilarated? ?

Photo by Bo Bridges A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - At 53 Tom Cruise is past the retirement age of every James Bond except Roger Moore. Yet his 19-year-old Mission Impossible series ticks on counting down the seconds till its next explosion -- and Cruises Ethan Hunt is determined to unman his cross-Atlantic competition. Forget high-tech gadgets. The older Cruise gets the more he relies on his fists. (And his abs and his nerves -- hell never let you forget he does his own stunts and why should he?) His body is the wonder-gizmo and Christopher McQuarrie writer and director of the fifth entry Rogue Nation keeps the camera on him like a nature show about a hungry lion.Every Mission Impossible has a different tone. Its the first franchise Cruise produced and he handpicked the old TV serial to be his blockbuster plaything a toy chest he offers to directors who catch his eye. Cruise used Mission Impossible to resurrect Brian De Palma capitalize on John Woo transition J.J. Abrams from TV to film and shift Brad Bird from pixels to a real man. Cruise allowed each helmer to adapt his own Ethan Hunt. To De Palma Hunt was a whiz kid. For Woo a horndog. Abrams a husband. Bird a cartoon. Cruise -- not his character -- is the only constant plus his continually returning bros Ving Rhames Simon Pegg and now Jeremy Renner and whatever new leggy long-haired brunette chooses to accept. (This time its newcomer Rebecca Ferguson and boy are we lucky to have her.)Film Details Mission Impossible Rogue Nation RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time131 min. More Info Here Ethan Hunt is a cousin of Jack Reacher -- the first film where McQuarrie directed Cruise -- only without the quips. McQuarrie the writer of The Usual Suspects gives Rogue Nation a suspicious street smarts. People dont just plan -- they double- and triple-think the enemy not that the plot matters more than a mousetrap. In an early scene a lovely blond agent coos ""Ive heard stories -- they cant all be true."" James Bond would flirt; any other action hero would crack a joke. Cruises Hunt doesnt kid. He seems to actually consider the question before slipping a small who knows? smile.Cruise enjoys playing humble. Thats the secret behind the biggest movie star in the world Hes always an underdog even when we dont think Ethan Hunt can lose. (And thats why youll never see him playing an effortless comic book immortal -- his characters are at their best when their backs are to the wall.) The game is how close he can get to death. Here hes battered buffeted and strung up like St. Sebastian. In one breath-sucking scene he tumbles into a water tank that tosses him like a gyroscope. What sells it isnt just the feats one wicked gag but his tiny toothy inhalation before he takes the plunge. Cruise even permits himself to be dwarfed by every lantern-jawed goon flung his way by the Syndicate an anti-IMF network hell-bent on triggering world havoc.

One spinning motorcycle stunt would have killed if hed pulled back so we could actually see it. Strapping Cruise to an airplane is a zippy idea yet in the execution I found myself distracted by how the wind flattened his hair to his forehead like a sweaty preachers toupee. Weirder still when Hunt goes into hiding Cruise sprouts a blond -- yes blond -- beard. Better is a simple circus-act move where Cruise monkeys up a pole doing what I can only describe as horizontal crunches. (Hed make a mint in Magic Mike 3.) Theres a fine car chase and a superior motorcycle dash that combines everything Cruise does well insane physics credible danger and human fragility.Of course Cruises best skill is his acting. He doesnt get to do much here -- only De Palma and Abrams gave Hunt an inner life -- and he hasnt gotten to do much in the last 10 years. His last decade is a too-eager-to-please shadow of his stretch from 1989 to 1999 which earned him three Oscar nominations.At Rogue Nations deepest McQuarrie seems to be trying to say something about luck Theres some mumbo jumbo about chance a shot of a rabbits-foot keychain. But luck is antithetical to everything Cruise represents. More than any actor -- and certainly every CG-reliant superhero -- he believes in bruises and exhaustion. He wants to earn the audiences love. After all when youve been pummeled by the global media how scary is a silly little plane?Rogue Nation is smart to pair him with the Swedish Ferguson an athletic beauty with appraising ice-blue eyes. In our first look at her as Syndicate agent Ilsa Ferguson unbuttons the top of her blouse before spinning around to interrogate Hunt. Were caught off-guard -- she doesnt seem like the type to lean on guile -- and she soon proves she isnt. For fun Ilsa practices holding her breath and while McQuarrie indulges in one long pan up her muscular thigh its not as entrancing as the characters brains. Alas Mission Impossibles rotating lovelies mean we probably wont see her again in the sixth installment.However newcomer Alec Baldwin as a McCarthy-esque CIA boss grins like hes already signed his contract even though hes saddled with lines such as ""Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny"" I giggled but for Cruise its true. The 5-foot-7 New Jersey kid went west and conquered California. His key franchise has conquered the world. And Cruise wont rest until he collapses.MISSION IMPOSSIBLE -- ROGUE NATION | Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie | Paramount Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

The theme that runs like a quick-burning fuse through ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" is the tricky relationship between inevitability and chance -- or luck rather as signaled by the brief appearance of a rabbits foot in one of Tom Cruises more brutal action sequences. Its a dynamic that applies to the film as well If the robust commercial performance of 2011s ""Mission Impossible -- Ghost Protocol"" made a follow-up inevitable then luck turns out to be very much on the side of this unusually spry and satisfying fifth entry which finds the surviving members of the Impossible Missions Force trying to neutralize an insidious global threat while struggling to convince their skeptical overlords that there is such a threat to begin with. The result is an existential quandary that writer-director Christopher McQuarrie negotiates with characteristic cleverness and a sly respect for the sheer durability of genre; at once questioning and reaffirming the pleasures of cinematic espionage this is the rare sequel that leaves its franchise feeling not exhausted but surprisingly resurgent at 19 years and counting. Despite early reports of soft tracking this late-summer Paramount release should meet with a solid embrace worldwide and could demonstrate considerable B.O. resilience through the doldrums of August. Its worth recalling that the Brad Bird-directed ""Ghost Protocol"" overcame a slow start to become the series highest-grossing entry (nearly 700 million worldwide) suggesting there was still plenty of life in ""Mission Impossible"" -- and in Tom Cruises career whatever personal embarrassments and professional setbacks he may have suffered along the way. After a few lackluster recent vehicles (""Jack Reacher"" ""Oblivion"") and one terrific underappreciated thriller (""Edge of Tomorrow"") its clearer than ever that Ethan Hunt is not just one of Cruises signature roles but also a commercial oasis to which he can reliably return in between riskier attempts to extend his personal brand. Or as someone snarls in one of McQuarries more amusing lines ""Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny"" And if the now 53-year-old Cruise isnt quite limber enough to do full justice to that description he continues to throw himself into harms way with energy conviction and an astonishing disregard for life and limb. That much is clear from a set piece that has already figured heavily into Paramounts marketing campaign and which is wisely dispensed with in the opening scene Bent on retrieving a cache of nerve-gas missiles from a band of Chechen separatist fighters Ethan leaps onto a military cargo plane mid-takeoff and hangs on for dear life as terra firma recedes behind him -- an astounding piece of airborne staging that Cruise with his distaste for green-screen effects and his fondness for performing his own stunts pulls off in typically sweat-free fashion. The sequence is at once a tasty appetizer and a total red herring and ""Rogue Nation"" swiftly gets down to business by putting Ethan and his fellow operatives out of commission. Citing the destruction of the Kremlin and other extensive property damage from ""Ghost Protocol"" brash CIA boss Alan Huntley (Alec Baldwin) succeeds in dismantling the IMF and absorbing it into the Agency -- a move that effectively paralyzes two of Ethans old pals top analyst William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and tech genius Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and proves serious enough to bring Ethans trustiest ally Luther Stickell (an underused Ving Rhames) back in from the cold. Still those guys are doing relatively well compared with Ethan himself who barely makes it through the opening credits before hes accosted in London tied up and repeatedly pummeled by a chrome-domed torture specialist called the Bone Doctor (Jens Hulten). Its the work of a wide-ranging shadow organization known simply as the Syndicate (the ""rogue nation"" of the title) which has been setting off destabilizing waves of violence civil unrest and catastrophe across the globe some of which -- far-flung industrial accidents jetliners vanishing into thin air -- have deliberately uncomfortable real-world echoes. Ethans mission which he has no choice but to accept is to take down this sinister group which will require him to team up with the tellingly named Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) a skilled but relatively untested British intelligence agent who has succeeded in infiltrating the Syndicate. (For all the films rampant globe-trotting its casting choices and frequent London stopovers give it a markedly Blighty flavor.) In classic spy-thriller fashion its never entirely clear whether Ilsa is friend or femme fatale -- especially after she and Ethan cross paths with a few well-positioned snipers at the Vienna State Opera where a lavish performance of ""Turandot"" serves as both backdrop and modus operandi for an up-in-the-rafters assassination attempt. The curtain comes crashing violently down on that episode but the movies second major action sequence is a marvel of precise execution and quietly fraught suspense forcing Ethan to swim his way into a highly pressurized underwater cavern in order to lay hands on a weapon that could make or break the Syndicate. Its a remarkably taut bit of business (shot on the large-format Alexa 65 6k digital camera) literally breathless in its intensity yet executed with the sort of deftness and economy may remind you of Ethans early reference to the great jazz drummer Shadow Wilson and his famously ""light touch."" Even when the characters are diving into giant water turbines or ripping up the streets of Morocco on motorcycles that intricate improvisatory lightness is a quality that McQuarries film has in spades. While the ""Mission Impossible"" movies have employed a different helmer with each new installment this is notably the first one to be directed and solely written by the same filmmaker -- which may explain why even at a pacey slightly trimmable 131 minutes ""Rogue Nation"" feels like the most dramatically sustained and conceptually unified picture in the series. To be sure McQuarrie isnt as flamboyant a stylist as his predecessors Brian De Palma and John Woo and although it shares with ""Ghost Protocol"" the same superb cinematographer (Robert Elswit) the new film has an altogether darker more workmanlike palette with little of the previous films eye-tickling compositional flair. (And whereas ""Ghost Protocol"" boasted 27 staggering minutes of footage shot on Imax cameras the image stays strictly widescreen in ""Rogue Nation"" gaining relatively little from the giant-screen format in which it was screened for review.) But whatever the filmmaking may lack in visual or visceral impact McQuarrie (whose past collaborations with Cruise include directing ""Jack Reacher"" and scripting ""Edge of Tomorrow"") more than compensates on the written front; his screenplay (based on a story conceived with Drew Pearce) achieves an admirable complexity without sacrificing coherence in the process. On the face of it ""Rogue Nation"" is another patchwork of Hitchcockian tropes and James Bondian cliches as familiar as the recurring strains of Lalo Schifrins classic musical theme Carefully encrypted messages are transmitted bank-account numbers are copied and deleted and high-tech explosives are armed and disarmed. Behind the Syndicate lurks a calculating uber-villain (played with understated menace by the protean Sean Harris) deluded enough to confuse mass annihilation with salvation and even after hes defeated the film acknowledges there will be many others like him waiting in the wings. Everyone is wearing a mask and not just of the latex variety As Ethan and Ilsas pointed conversations remind us these agents are professional con artists who must decide anew each day whether they owe their highest allegiance to their cause their employers their friends in the field or the civilians who are always at risk of becoming collateral damage. A ""Mission Impossible"" movie will admittedly never be mistaken for John le Carre even if this one does feature the marvelous Simon McBurney (a veteran of 2011s ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"") as a high-ranking official whose connections within the British intelligence community run treacherously deep. Still ""Rogue Nation"" exudes a knowing sophistication and a winking sense of fun that make it the most philosophically brooding film in the series acknowledging the soul-crushing futility of so much intelligence work especially for those who have been smeared and disavowed by their own agency. ""I cant see another way"" Ethan despairs as the story approaches its fatal endgame -- one that he realizes is utterly unavoidable and perhaps even preordained. And so the characters sense of defeat becomes a metaphor for the essentially formulaic nature of the action-thriller calling into question the viability of a genre of which weve already seen countless iterations and will certainly see countless more. Yet the unexpected pleasure of ""Rogue Nation"" is the way it claws its way to freedom and a sense of renewal In writing Ethan and his colleagues out of an impossibly tight corner McQuarrie ingeniously turns both formula and metaphor inside out. While the most recent ""Die Hard"" and ""Terminator"" movies have playfully acknowledged that their once-strapping male stars are well past their physical prime the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise is having none of it. Whatever combination of stunt work and digital trickery was involved (very little if reports are to be believed) Cruise remains as deft a physical performer as ever and projects nary a shred of self-consciousness or vanity; he is no less than Ethan Hunt himself an incorrigible daredevil and a consummate professional. Ferguson a Swedish actress best known for TV productions like ""The Red Tent"" and ""The White Queen"" brings a strong engaging if not particularly enigmatic presence to a series whose female operatives have never been its strong suit; her iffy chemistry with Cruise is kept further at bay by a story that aside from some occupationally mandated toplessness remains strictly within PG-13 boundaries. Baldwins blustering antagonistic CIA man lends the proceedings a welcome punch while Pegg previously seen in ""Ghost Protocol"" as a comic-relief figure with a full arsenal of malfunctioning gadgets comes fully into his own here as an indispensable and uniquely courageous member of Ethans team. Renner and Rhames are rather sidelined by comparison though they get considerably more screen time than Zhang Jinchu whose prominently billed blink-and-you-miss-it performance as a CIA underling feels like a sop to the films Asia-based investors China Movie Channel and Alibaba Pictures Group. The perilous landscape of globalized blockbuster filmmaking is very much its own Syndicate but at least on the evidence of ""Mission Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" this is one series whose identity has yet to be compromised.

FutureUser says September 4 2015 at 656 pm I saw it twice already. I picked up a couple of clever little tidbits 2nd time around. Very well-paced and keeps the action at the right level all the way through. Keeps you guessing. The villain is a very subtle sort of sneak -- constant pout raspy voice like a snake nose twitching like a rat -- great casting Funny how the key moment in Turandot opera (compare another Puccini opera Tosca was used in a recent Bond movie) the tenor shouts in Italian ""mine at last"" -- which was the point of the villain setting up the whole scene in the first place. Yet another clever little synchronicity in this film. Worth seeing at least one more time Reply keletheardentfangirl says August 10 2015 at 432 pm Reblogged this on Ardent Fangirl and commented Watched this movie over the weekend. Reply Robin Pinto says July 30 2015 at 854 pm I Guess now times are close when they are going to break the Earning record of ""Furious 7"" ""Avatar"" etc. I am huge fan of Cruise and regular watch all movies of Tom Cruise..... Reply bikash Dwibedi says July 26 2015 at 128 pm There is no biggest global superstar than the Tom cruise in the world he definitely bang back by biggest commercial success of rouge nation Best luck cruise you are the best Reply harry georgatos says July 25 2015 at 1138 pm With another actor and different packaging concentrating on ideas and concepts that lead to compelling storytelling instead an emphasis on stuntwork the MI franchise could have been unique. Tom Cruise is a limited actor who has surrounded himself with the best directors in the business. MI should be rebooted with emphasis on script and story. MI can be an even bigger success with a better actor closer to what was the tv series.

Theyre own filmmakers will NEVER be able to make something like this but its a shame we have to have their sore-thumb actors wasted in superfluous often awkward bit parts. Even Chinese audiences must get sick of the pandering demanded by their own people. Reply jhs39 says July 24 2015 at 311 pm Ilsa Faust? Christopher Mcquarrie clearly has a sense of humor-B movie fans and literature majors both will immediately distrust her.

Reply SoFar says July 24 2015 at 937 am Cruise is always the best MI5 is gonna rock maybe save Paramount from Terminator flop Reply jazz says July 24 2015 at 933 am cruise cant do anything but these movies...he could never act and he found a niche that would be successful no matter who was in the lead possibly even more successful with someone else... Reply r0ckmypants says July 29 2015 at 718 am Cant act? Did you see Magnolia? Jerry Maguire? The Last Samurai? Born on the Fourth of July? Collateral? A Few Good Men? Reply michael prestage says July 24 2015 at 932 am While its certainly true that the very capable Alexa 65 was used on Rogue Nation (predominantly involving aerial shots and visual effect plate work) cinematographer Robert Elswit and his crew utilized a variety of traditional Panavised 35mm cameras to shoot the majority of the film. To date all MI films have originated on celluloid. Aside from this one omission this was an especially fine review. Reply Griff says July 25 2015 at 251 am Oh Cruise can definitely act - Born on the Fourth of July and Rainman are proof of that - but he prefers to do these sort of age-defying stuntfests. Reply OB says July 25 2015 at 436 pm Absolutely right. Id further add MAGNOLIA and JERRY MAGUIRE to that list.

Daily Edition Login to download Mission Impossible a Rogue Nation Film Review 800 AM PDT 7/24/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS The series still flies as does Tom Cruise. TWITTER Tom Cruise is back for the fifth installment in the popular action film franchise helmed by Christopher McQuarrie and costarring Alec Baldwin and Rebecca Ferguson. Thanks to a sharp script that springs a real surprise or two and a pace that never slackens Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation rates as the second-best of the numerous franchise titles of the summer after Mad Max Fury Road. Armed with an absorbing mystery plot that does more than just connect the dots between action set-pieces (the most outlandish of which is dispensed with in a Bond-like opener) writer-director Christopher McQuarrie maintains the uptick in MI quality established by the last two entries and should land this entry within the series customary range of a half-billion bucks worldwide. Working with Tom Cruise for the fifth time (if you include his uncredited rewrite on the last MI feature Ghost Protocol) McQuarrie benefits dramatically from extending the IMF teams official ostracization to a point of total disenfranchisement from the American government; in an early scene the CIA chief (Alec Baldwin) succeeds in getting the stealth group shut down forcing Ethan Hunts new partners from the last film Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Benji (Simon Pegg) to go to work at CIA headquarters. And this is the thanks Ethan gets just after having jumped on to the wing of a giant A400 transport plane hanging precariously off its side during take-off in a stunt famous even before the film is released -- and that it would appear Cruise performed for real. For his efforts at thwarting the delivery of a stash of chemical weapons material Ethan is strung up like a hog for butcher by requisitely swarthy members of The Syndicate. This used to be one of the numerous names for American organized crime but has now been appropriated by an international terrorist organization prepared to up the ante to previously unimagined levels of violence and dominance. Read more Mission Impossible 5 World Premiere Tom Cruise Takes Over Vienna The wild card in the deck is an impressively composed and able young woman named Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who seems to be allied with The Syndicate except when she doesnt. Even if its not difficult to guess whose side shell ultimately wind up on Ilsas ability to keep shrewd minds guessing about her allegiances is a high-wire act she sustains to very near the end helped in no small measure by Ferguson whose grown-up poise recalls that of some 1940s movie stars. McQuarrie doesnt change the prescription for what makes this franchise so successful nor does he have the most practiced hand among the series directors at milking the big action sequences for all theyre worth. But hes deepened the dramatic involvement by so thoroughly casting Ethan Hunt to the wolves that hes a man without a country or a reliable partner -- which is why hes forced to believe that Ilsa will stand with him at the end of the day despite much circumstantial evidence to the contrary. Without any support system Ethan can still move around the world and elude the CIA which refuses to acknowledge that The Syndicate even exists. He cleverly lures out Benji to help try to thwart a Manchurian Candidate-like political assassination that is spectacularly synched up to a performance of Turandot at the Vienna Opera House. With the CIA believing that Ethan might have been behind this outrage Brandt slips out of Langley and enlists Ilsa to help track Ethan down before the spooks do. All roads lead to Morocco where again Ilsas loyalties flip-flop in two more high-risk set pieces. For the first in order to snatch an all-important computer chip from an underwater source Ethan trains to hold his breath for three minutes but in the actual event must do so for considerably longer. The second which is more up Ethans (and Cruises) usual alley has him chasing Ilsa -- and being chased by the resurgent Syndicate goons -- through Casablanca and into the desert on very fast motorcycles driven at very extreme angles. In the end however it comes down to the old spy game -- English-style involving lies deception disguises subterfuge and (dis)loyalty at very high levels. Little by little the Syndicates leader the blandly lizard-like Solomon Lane (Sean Harris effectively employing a thin reedy voice) is forced out into the open if hes to get what he wants clearing the way for the ultimate showdown that Ethan has long desired. The formula of ingredients is familiar and time-tested to be sure but some cocktails go down much better than others and McQuarrie and company have gotten theirs just right here. The protagonists dilemmas are quite extreme the surprises come in all sizes and the ultra-smooth professionalism displayed in all departments early on encourages the sense that youre in good hands a feeling that ends up being justified. Although Cruise is now 53 he is very far from being a candidate for the Expendables series anytime soon. He looks great acts with unassuming confidence without needing to ingratiate and credibly conquers innumerable physical challenges. The window between Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation was four years as quick a turnaround as theres ever been between franchise entries so at this rate its entirely plausible that the actor could have at least one more Mission in him before Ethan retires to a desk job. Ferguson better known for her work as Queen Elizabeth in televisions The White Queen than for last years feature Hercules makes Ilsa a woman of unquestioned confidence and sang froid; crucially she credibly convinces whomever shes working with at the moment that shes on their side. Pegg gets a few moments to shine more so than Renner while Ving Rhames -- essentially sidelined in the last entry -- once again has Ethans back. Baldwin is right on the money as the smooth-talking CIA chief. Along with the great international locations the film benefits from ace creative contributions all down the line nowhere more so than from Joe Kraemers virtually non-stop score which seamlessly blends strains of Lalo Schifrins original TV series theme and Puccini into his own rambunctious but not overbearing work. The presentation in the IMAX format at the press screening looked and sounded terrific.

Factor Furious 7 Tom Cruises MI5 Take Stunts to Ridiculous New Heights (Video) Should you choose to accept it this fifth entry goes just a bit overboard in delivering the globe-trotting thrills ""Mission Impossible Rogue Nation"" is the very model of a modern major film franchise Loaded with globe-trotting adventure breathtaking stunts and just enough plot to hold together the whole ball of wax its the sort of movie where you wouldnt bat an eye if Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team were suddenly replaced by the cast of ""Furious 7."" Not that theres anything wrong with that -- there are good popcorn thrills and there are bad ones and if ""Rogue Nation"" falls slightly below ""Ghost Protocol"" on the adrenaline scale this fifth entry in the spy saga is definitely the sort of over-the-top spree that generates goofy grins clenched armrests and spilled soda. See Video Watch Tom Cruise Scared Sh-tless During High-Flying Mission Impossible - Rogue Nation Stunt (Video) ""Rogue Nation"" doesnt do anything particularly wrong inasmuch as it overdoes something right -- by the time we reach the final chase/shoot-out/hand-to-hand combat set piece a bit of ice-cream-headache fatigue has begun to set in. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (""Jack Reacher"" ""The Usual Suspects"") skillfully assembles each of these sequences but the film might have benefited from excising at least one of them. See Video Chris Pine Zoe Saldana Idris Elba Make Irresistible Offer to Star Trek Fans Walk-On Role for Charity (Video) The film is up and sprinting from the very beginning. We get a minute or so of banter between field agents Benjy (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) and their controller Brandt (Jeremy Renner) before Hunt is hanging off the side of an airplane thats taking off. (For the film to slough off its poster moment before the opening credits is an act of boldness akin to kicking off a concert with the hit single.) Hunt is in pursuit of The Syndicate a shadowy team of terrorists responsible for a series of seemingly random disasters and assassinations and when he arrives in London he learns that The Syndicate is onto him and his entire team. Meanwhile in Washington CIA chief Hunley (Alec Baldwin) is testifying before a closed committee to pull the plug on IMF. Also Read Simon Pegg Backpedals on Comic Book Movies I Am Still a Nerd and Proud Hunt alone and unsupported must elude both the CIA and The Syndicate while trying to prove the existence of the latter to the former. This task involves attempting to foil an assassination attempt at the Vienna Opera (a sequence that calls to mind both ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" and ""Foul Play"") breaking into the underwater database of a facility in Morocco (sans oxygen tanks of course) and at least one of the fooled-you-I-was-wearing-a-mask switcheroos that are the cornerstone of the franchise. With a bevy of villains passing through casting directors Mindy Marin and Lucinda Syson wisely pepper the film with memorable faces; one look at Sean Harris or Jens Hulten and their physiognomy remains burned into our memory for the whole film. Also Read Jeremy Renner Takes on Gay Rumors F-king Say Whatever the Hell You Want About Me Also very well cast is Rebecca Ferguson (""Hercules"") as the mysterious Ilsa who could be an ally for Ethan or a double agent setting him up for betrayal. Since Ferguson isnt a well-known actress in this country (most of her credits are from Swedish and U.K. television) its not immediately apparent where her sympathies will eventually lie. Ferguson also makes for a captivating screen presence; Robert Elswits camera practically fetishizes her long legs and her face combines the wide and world-weary eyes of a 1970s French film star with the solid cheekbones of a 1940s contract player. (Anyone casting ""The Alice Faye Story"" should look no further.) ""Mission Impossible Rogue Nation"" never pretends to be anything but a solidly entertaining collection of fighting chasing driving falling and going-to-the-place-and-getting-the-thing.

Five Mission Impossible movies in and he still feels like a blank slate a robot with Tom Cruises empty grin and a vocabulary ripped straight from the Bumper Book of Pithy Quips. We learn nothing new about him in Rogue Nation other than the fact he can hold his breath for three minutes and is really good at remembering stuff. If they met at a party even James Bond would sneak away in search of better conversation. All of which leaves Jack Reacher director Christopher McQuarries would-be-edgier series entry feeling a bit uncentred - theres only so much dead air Simon Pegg can fill with nervy British prattling. And these two are very much a double-act this time around as Hunt is declared a wanted man by the CIA and must track down the mysterious Syndicate (imagine Spectre on a budget) without his usual resources. Theyre aided and/or hindered depending on her mood by Rebecca Ferguson as slippery double agent Ilsa the most interesting character here by a mile. Rogue Nation is an uneven film in the plus camp we have Ferguson the wonderful Sean Harris as a psycho with the voice of Baron Greenback from Dangermouse and a fistful of tight not-too-flashy action scenes (short of some fleeting funny business with a plane right at the start there are no daft gravity-defying stunts this time). But the debit column is a line or two longer from the uninvolving plot to the blunt dialogue from Cruises empty-shell performance to Alec Baldwin delivering perhaps the most idiotic line ever in a major blockbuster (at the screening we attended the entire audience hooted with laughter). If as we suspect this turns out to be Ethans last impossible mission we cant imagine hell be greatly mourned.
