FROM JUSTIN TO KELLY -- -- Kelly Clarkson Justin Guarini Katherine Bailess; rated PG (backstabbing cuddling dancing and midriffs); Century Theatres 16. When I found out that the people at 20th Century Fox didnt want critics to see their ""American Idol"" movie ""From Justin to Kelly"" before you could I assumed they thought we would be some kind of buzz kill for their totally awesome beach movie. But having just returned from a next-to-vacant afternoon showing I can tell you the movie is less ""From Here to Eternity"" than from bad to worse. Kelly Clarkson the original ""American Idol"" winner has been pushed into a romantic comedy with her runner-up the Muppet-mopped Justin Guarini. They have the chemistry of step-siblings so a movie that has them make out is as one of the few girls in the theater exclaimed ""so gross."" ""From Justin to Kelly"" was made so soon after their victories there was barely time to change their names. So Kelly plays ""Kelly"" and Justin plays ""Justin"" and anyone who plunks down 7.50 to see them sing plays the fool. The stars meet in Miami Beach and immediately start lip-synching and gyrating. The vocals flow like Zima; the moves dont flow at all. Kelly drove to Florida from Texas with her girlfriends for spring break. Justin is there from Pennsylvania with his friends. On the beach the flirting and chasing and mix-ups begin mostly at the hands of Kellys party-monster pal Alexa (Katherine Bailess) a conniving blonde whos trying to get Justin for herself. Alexa were told has a history of wanting whatever man wants Kelly. And as a poorly lighted nightclub dance number suggests she is not merely the movies villain shes its Britney. Whats depressing about ""From Justin to Kelly"" whose title seems to refer to the text messages he sends her is that its been made without a lick of love skill or apparently money. ""American Idol"" judge Randy Jackson is more attractive than this movie. This happens to be a Robert ""Shes All That"" Iscove joint. You can tell because ""From Justin to Kelly"" has the same remarkable cruddiness the director cultivated for his Freddy Prinze Jr. vehicles the noncommittal camerawork; the sub-boy-band choreography; the insulting cluelessness about human behavior happy endings kissing and life as it is generally known on Earth. Kim Fuller whipped up the script evidently in minutes and he collaborated on the rest of the PG production to tell us that music brings the people of spring break together. Yeah Worst of all Iscove has an almost hateful sense of how to stage the musical numbers. Guarini for instance speaks a line of dialogue to Clarkson and a nanosecond later hes just lip-synching all over her. Her disgusted face is appropriate The songs here are moldy Kraft singles. The ballad ""Timeless Love"" is sung by the would-be heavy petters aboard a motorboat. This scene was shot earlier this year but as Guarini and Clarkson do their best James Ingram and Patti Austin you feel as though youve been whisked away to 1989 and the boat is headed straight for the set of ""Saved by the Bell."" ""From Justin to Kelly"" has been rated PG for backstabbing cuddling dancing and midriffs. Running time 80 minutes.

Its a sign of the deep cynicism and desperation behind From Justin To Kelly a spectacularly awful musical-comedy built around American Idol slaves Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson that such a question could ever be dignified with a response. Moving from the antiseptic environs of reality television into the natural light Guarini and Clarkson behave like sheepish animals forced to mate in captivity; they kiss as if their lips were made of wilted brussels sprouts. As with this years other Spring Break cheapie The Real Cancun cinema proves again to be the great leveler of bad TV cutting down the network bean-counters hoping to find new revenue streams in a medium that lays their hubris bare. Deemed unsuitable for critics--who according to Clarkson ""only like stuff like In The Bedroom""--this stinking piece of pop-culture flotsam washes ashore on Miami Beach where the would-be sweethearts meet among the throngs of wholesome freshly scrubbed revelers. Theyre from two different worlds Guarini the self-styled ""King Of Spring Break"" must relinquish his crown to have any chance with Clarkson a good-girl Texan whom friends describe as ""a body shot away from Amish."" Referring to themselves as the ""Pennsylvania Posse"" Guarini and his buddies (sensitive nerd Brian Dietzen and chiseled ladies man Greg Siff) throw beachside events such as a whipped-cream bikini contest and a ""Margarita Madness"" party that appears to have been sponsored by the Womens Christian Temperance Union. For her part the squeaky-clean Clarkson gets dragged into this den of PG-rated sin by a starry-eyed romantic (Anika Noni Rose) and a duplicitous blonde tramp (Katherine Bailess) who does everything she can to separate the lovebirds. But the by-the-numbers plotting courtesy of Spice World screenwriter Kim Fuller (brother of evil-genius Idol producer Simon Fuller) exists only to lead the audience to what it really wants to see canned orchestrations syrupy beach ballads strangled octaves and plenty of robotic boy-band bump-and-grind. The two leads fulfilling their indentured servitude to the Fox Corporation look distinctly uncomfortable forcing chemistry with each other as well as croaking a cheesy sunset duet about ""timeless"" love as if theyre bound to the terms of a restraining order. It doesnt help that director Robert Iscove (Shes All That) converts Miami Beach into an art-deco revamp of Branson Missouri removing the suggestion that these teens belong to the same species as the sex monsters in The Real Cancun. More than anything From Justin To Kelly needs Simon Cowell the fork-tongued Idol judge who gives the show its only sliver of tension. Perhaps he can be convinced to offer a few withering appraisals on the DVD commentary track; goodness knows even Paula Abdul cant be counted on for encouragement here.

Jheri Curled caramel? (Actually that must be what he uses to lubricate his vocal cords.) I certainly had a lot of time to contemplate the question when I saw From Justin to Kelly the appalling bland de soleil musical thats the latest demonstration that reality TV tie-in movies dont work. Just pretend for a moment that they did. Imagine that six months from now your local omniplex is dominated by the 5000-screen nationwide opening of movies like ""The Real Bangkok and From Clay to Ruben."" But I digress into nightmare. How bad is ""From Justin to Kelly""? Set in Miami during spring break its like ""Grease The Next Generation"" acted out by the food-court staff at SeaWorld. Justin cast as the cool-dude ""mayor"" of spring break spends the entire movie getting his text messages crossed with nice girl Kelly Clarkson. He may in other words have missed nabbing the crown on ""American Idol"" but hes still chasing after the winner. You could say that the beach-blanket imbecility is no worse than what we got in 60s musicals like ""Where the Boys Are"" except that Connie Francis didnt sing as if she were selling passion by the yard.

Heather Havrilesky Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics American Idol Movies Entertainment News This ""American Idol"" spinoff musical is one of the worst movies youll ever see -- but its still not worth seeing. Remember girls when you were 10 or 11 and you made your Barbie dolls go on dates even if they had to stoop to dating your brothers G.I. Joe? Remember the kind of dialogue youd dream up for your dolls gleaned from years of watching washed-up stars romance each other on ""The Love Boat""? Well those early Barbie-improv experiences might just qualify you to write the screenplay of a 12 million summer movie. If you dont believe me feast your eyes on this scene from ""From Justin to Kelly"" in which Justin (Justin Guarini) and Kelly (Kelly Clarkson) putter around in a motorboat at sunset alternately bellowing a song about how madly in love they are and quietly awkwardly discussing their budding romance. Kelly ""So do you bring all your girls out here?"" Justin ""No I mostly come out here to think."" Kelly ""What are you thinking about now?"" Justin ""Thinking about how glad I am that you gave me a second chance."" My brothers G.I. Joe was always going places alone to think too probably because I already suspected that most guys spent far less time in quiet contemplation than I had hoped. Even so I was a little disappointed that Kelly gave Justin a second chance since it wouldve been more entertaining to watch Kelly sit around her hotel room eating corn dogs and painting her toenails than it was to witness a romance so unconvincing and leaden youd think both Justin and Kelly were gay and incredibly seasick. But maybe they were still queasy from the first half-hour of the film in which most of the scenes are less dynamic and original than a 6-year-olds puppet show. ""Dude this year spring break is gonna rock"" proclaims one of Justins two nondescript sidekicks. ""We are going to go to the best parties and meet the hottest guys"" squeals one of Kellys bland pals. Like strangers stuck on a crowded smelly bus Kelly and Justin dont meet but rather apprehend each other on the beach in one of the most awkward badly choreographed terribly edited party scenes ever made. In the unlucky couples first moments dancing together they look about as swept away as they might while pulling a wad of hair from a shower drain. The music is mixed badly and sounds flat and distant from the scene and the camera seems to capture the dancing crowds at all the wrong moments making every move look clumsy and out of sync with the music. The horrible lighting and crappy makeup certainly dont help matters much. Despite the fun-in-the-sun theme the entire movie seems to be shot under overcast skies and the interior scenes are so badly lit you probably have home movies that look a lot better. (The director here is Robert Iscove previously in charge of such teen romances as ""Shes All That"" and ""Boys and Girls."") Kelly Clarkson is an attractive enough woman who can look beautiful with the proper makeup and lighting but in this movie she looks like somebodys frumpy cousin they were forced to bring to the party. Justin Guarini rings about as false as he did in the latter stages of last years ""American Idol"" finals and inexplicably strides around among the bare-chested men on the beach wearing cargo pants and long-sleeved shirts. Whats amazing is that a scripted choreographed musical could be this bad when party scenes from the flawed but enjoyable reality-movie flop ""The Real Cancun"" could lure a nun into the spirit of spring-break insanity. The producers of that movie took hours of footage of untrained dancers and random bystanders at clubs and made them look like movie stars. The makers of ""From Justin to Kelly"" took two talented vocalists who are also able enough dancers and made them look like ""Fame"" rejects. The bland lines that drop from their mouths make the drunken blatherings of the stars of ""The Real Cancun"" sound like snippets of Shakespeare. You Might Also Like But lets not forget the story which brings us back to the days when Barbies conniving best friend Superstar Barbie cheated with G.I. Joe in the Barbie Dreamhouse. Youll recall that Kelly and Justin meet and fall madly in love while pulling hair from a shower drain. Afterward Kellys like ""So do you really think he was looking at me?"" and Kellys nice friend Kaya (Anika Noni Rose) says that he totally was but Kellys evil friend Alexa (Katherine Bailess) gives Justin her cell number instead of Kellys and then enters Kelly in a whipped-cream bikini contest (Kellys reaction ""You entered me in a whipped-cream bikini contest?"") knowing that Justin is one of the contests organizers and judges. Kelly thinks that is totally gross and there is like no way shes going to participate which she demonstrates by shoving whipped cream in Justins face. Burn So then Justin keeps messaging Kelly but hes like messaging the wrong number the whole time and Alexa keeps messaging back stuff like ""Sorry not intrsted"" So Kelly tries to meet Justin but Alexa keeps changing the plans and not telling Kelly but they do get to go on the boat ride and thats when they both start to bellow and swoon without looking at each other. Which is pretty sly since every time these two look at each other they seem to be either stifling laughter or trying not to vomit all over each others sneakers. And it would all be funny if this werent one of the worst ways you could possibly blow 12 million. I know what youre thinking though ""That sounds really bad incredibly bad so bad in fact ... that its good"" And I dont blame you for getting your hopes so high. After all there werent any press screenings for the movie and Clarkson openly proclaimed that critics wouldnt like it. ""They like stuff like In the Bedroom"" she told TV Guide Online. ""Theyre gonna want to tear into it because all people like to do is build something up to tear it down. This movie shouldnt be screened by the critics [sic] because its not for them -- its for the fans."" Clarkson should have known shed send our expectations soaring with such comments. And maybe she did believe her movie might be the so-bad-its-good hit of the season a classic in the exalted tradition of ""Crossroads"" or ""The Apple"" or ""Lambada The Forbidden Dance."" But when Kelly sings an entire melodramatic ballad while walking zombie-like through an unattractive swatch of sand and trees all emotionless and scrub-faced as if she just rose from bed and then Justin appears in the background like the villain in that scene in ""Halloween II"" only this scene really isnt supposed to be horrifying its just painful and no it doesnt hurt so good. These two have incredible soaring voices and maybe theyre not movie stars but it might have been nice if some modicum of skill had been applied to making them look like they could be movie stars instead of extras from ""Night of the Living Dead."" Justin and Kelly both looked a million times better sweating under the lights on ""American Idol"" and even their most tedious performances were far more entertaining than the endless boat ride and hideous beach march of ""From Justin to Kelly."" Forget the critics. This movie doesnt just do a disservice to the fans it does a horrible disservice to Justin and Kelly manufactured stars who are new to the game and have to rely on their supposedly expert handlers to make them look good. America is more than willing to embrace manufactured celebrity but part of the fun is seeing how the magic can transform a talented but ordinary kid into something larger than life. The makers of ""From Justin to Kelly"" didnt even bother to break out the pixie dust.

"From Justin to Kelly American Idler - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW From Justin to Kelly American IdlerJune 23 2003|Greg Braxton | Times Staff Writer The arrival of ""From Justin to Kelly"" -- or more appropriately ""The American Idol Movie"" -- couldnt be more timely. ""Chicago"" and ""Moulin Rouge"" have given movie musicals a revived respectability and legitimacy threatening to make the tacky low-budget film musical an endangered species.But the vast legion of guilty-pleasure fans who embrace the guilty pleasures of ""Xanadu"" applaud Mariah Carey in ""Glitter"" and swoon over Michelle Pfeiffer in ""Grease 2"" can rest easy. While ""From Justin to Kelly"" starring the top two finishers of last years ""American Idol"" TV talent show doesnt quite have the jaw-dropping moments of its predecessors it will do for now. Besides there are worse ways to spend 81 minutes of your summer than watching a major studio release featuring two newcomers whose previous film experience consisted of waiting in the snack line at their local multiplex kicking up sand during elaborate production numbers on south Florida beaches.""From Justin to Kelly"" is less a movie than a big-screen bobblehead of Fox TVs phenomenon ""American Idol."" . ""Idol"" has become the top-rated series in its last two seasons spawning hit albums and singles DVDs and concert tours. Naturally an ""American Idol""-based movie to further drive the marketing onslaught was inevitable.The film was designed as a showcase for Kelly Clarkson a former Texas waitress who was crowned the first ""American Idol"" and curly-haired Justin Guarini. Since her ""coronation"" Clarkson has had a No. 1 album and single. Guarinis recently released album has received much less hoopla.The plot is a 21st century twist on the Frankie Avalon-Annette Funicello beach movies of the 1960s -- sort of hip-hop meets the flip-flops. However the squeaky-clean ""From Justin to Kelly"" makes those films look like ""The Real Cancun."" Theres not a wet T-shirt or drunken youth in sight. Youd find more mayhem at a Blockbuster on a Friday night.Clarkson takes on the role of Kelly a Texas waitress with a cautious streak who journeys with her two best friends Kaya (Anika Noni Rose) and Alexa (Katherine Bailess) to spring break in Miami Beach. Also frolicking among the trunks and bikinis is Justin (Guarini) a Pennsylvania college student who is promoting parties along with his friends horribly bad rapper Brandon (Greg Siff) and cyber-nerd Eddie (Brian Dietzen).Its only a few minutes after the opening credits before Kelly and Justin catch each others eye as they -- along with about a hundred scantily clad extras -- break out in song and dance on the beach. But the moment is brief. Although they try hard to get their groove on their romance is constantly thwarted by the devious blond vixen Alexa who wants Justin for herself.Relentlessly inoffensive innocuous and vacuous ""From Justin to Kelly"" is nowhere near as bad as its pre-release publicity would suggest (the film was not screened in advance for critics). Director Robert Iscove mostly keeps a breezy pace there are plenty of songs and dance numbers spaced between the clunky dialogue and Travis Paynes choreography is lively if unimaginative.As a vehicle for Clarkson and Guarini the movie is less certain. Fans of the show will most likely be satisfied. Clarkson has a pleasant enough voice and Guarinis hair gives a fine performance. The two dont really embarrass themselves even in their dramatic scenes. But the filmmakers are savvy enough to realize that Clarkson and Guarini dont yet have the charisma or chops to carry a movie even a throwaway one like this.They may be ""American Idols"" but based on their movie debut dont count on Clarkson and Guarini being signed for the film version of ""Sweeney Todd."" But theres still hope for fans longing for ""From Justin to Kelly 2"" ... or who knows perhaps ""Xanadu Revisited.""From Justin to KellyMPAA rating PG for thematic elements sensuality and brief language.Times guidelines The setting is spring break in Miami but theres more skin and debauchery in a Britney Spears video.Kelly Clarkson...KellyJustin Guarini...JustinKatherine Bailess...AlexaAnika Noni Rose...KayaGreg Siff...BrandonTwentieth Century Fox presents a 19 Entertainment production released by Twentieth Century Fox.

By that assumption coworkers and cell mates would get along famously.From Justin to Kelly stars American Idols Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini (obligatory local-angle plug from Doylestown). In this frothy beach movie they make pop-music lite together but create an utterly unconvincing romantic couple seeming more like siblings or best friends. From Ruben to Clay might work better.Executive producer Simon Fuller who packaged the Spice Girls and his screenwriting brother Kim (who wrote Spice World) knew better than to let these singers act for too long at a stretch. From J to Ks best conceit is to have the cast break out into song and dance at the spill of a bright-colored drink a frequent occurrence. Grease its not - comparing Guarini to John Travolta would be a felony - but the movie is wholesome silly and entirely suitable for young children.With apologies to Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon (obligatory second local plug a South Philadelphia native) the best beach movie of all time remains Where the Boys Are starring Jim Hutton Dolores Hart Connie Francis the divine Paula Prentiss and an already-tan George Hamilton. Clearly the model for From J to K the 1960 sand opera offered humor social tension a hint of danger a good singer and actors with dramatic and comic range.By contrast From J to K with only singers and dancers is basically a more wholesome MTV Dance Party the musical festivities interrupted every so often to search for a plot.Kelly is a sweet Texan bar singer who heads to Florida on spring break with nice friend Kaya (Anika Noni Rose) and bad girl Alexa (Katherine Bailess) who charges 23 bikinis to daddys credit card. ""I told him my therapists name was Neiman Marcus."" Justin arrives at the same location with his ""Pennsylvania Posse"" Internetaholic Eddie (Brian Dietzen) and slick Brandon (Greg Siff who looks a Brady Buncher and sure enough has played one).Alexa is so jealous of Kelly that she tries to thwart her budding romance with Justin largely through text-messaging that fouls up their assignations. When the duo do get together food tumbles misunderstandings ensue and Idol-style songs break out. Director Robert Iscove seems well aware that the two throw few sparks and he positions the singers staring in opposite directions.The supposed tension is that Kelly is a budding feminist while Justin will stage any event for a buck. Incensed upon hearing about his whipped-cream-bikini contest she proclaims ""Its degrading. Its humiliating. Its fattening.""By reference and location the movie continually cross-cuts between Miami and Fort Lauderdale providing the movies sole source of tension - where in Florida the boys and girls actually are.Contact staff writer Karen Heller at 215-854-2586 or khellerphillynews.com.From Justin to Kelly  (out of four stars)Produced by Gayla Aspinall and John Steven Agoglia directed by Robert Iscove written by Kim Fuller photography by Francis Kenny music by Michael Wandmacher distributed by 20th Century Fox.Running time 1 hr. 35 min.Kelly . . .

But pre-teenybopper auds may not turn out given Foxs decision to postpone the spring opening to the vastly more competitive summer frame. ""From Justin to Kelly"" a bigscreen outing for TV ""American Idol"" stars Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini is a parochial spring-break musical full of sexless romances and alcohol-free parties apparently aimed at a pre-teenybopper aud. But even that young crowd may not turn out in the expected droves given Foxs decision to postpone the originally slated spring opening to the vastly more competitive summer frame. Pics residence in theaters looks to be about as brief as a spring break hotel stay (or the run of ""The Real Cancun"") followed by the inevitable television premiere timed to hype season three of ""American Idol."" Exec produced by promoter-producer Simon Fuller (impresario behind the Spice Girls and ""American Idol"") and written by his brother Kim ""From Justin to Kelly"" is like most of the Fullers other creations less art than advertisement -- a feature-length opiate designed to sell soundtrack CDs and promote the solo careers of Clarkson and Guarini (the winner and runner-up respectively from the first season of ""American Idol""). Pic opens with Kelly (Clarkson) belting out country ballads to a handful of admirers in a two-bit bar in Texas where there arent enough customers to assemble a halfway-respectable dance line. Her friends Kaia (Anika Noni Rose) and Alexa (Katherine Bailess) arrive with spring break plane tickets in hand but the airline went bankrupt and the tickets are useless. The girls want to use Kellys car to go to Miami as scheduled. Kelly ""reluctantly"" decides to help out and soon the trio arrives in sunny Florida where three buddies from Pennsylvania -- nice guy Justin (Guarini) vain ""event promoter"" Brandon (Greg Siff) and pale nerdy Eddie (Brian Dietzen) -- have also just rolled into town. Its a meet-cute just waiting to happen. When Kelly and Justin first lay eyes on each other they start singing and dancing signaling that ""From Justin to Kelly"" is a full-fledged movie musical of the sort almost never made any more. But while the characters may have refreshingly few reservations about bursting into song the songs are born out of that anonymous sound-alike whir that defines the brunt of top-40 music today. And when there is a flash of inspiration like a Cuban-flavored number featuring Kaya it is cut inexplicably short fading out in mid-song. (The irony of the ""Idol"" franchise is that the contestants are given a treasure trove of pop music riches to perform during the competition but winning the contest means being forced to record original songs that simply cant hold a candle.) Pics director Robert Iscove previously made the surprise Freddie Prinze Jr. hit ""Shes All That"" (followed by the not-so-surprise Prinze flop ""Boys and Girls""). Fullers screenplay shows the same superficial view of adolescents advanced in Iscoves other films. Here Kelly and Justin serve as the fulcrums for supporting characters positioned out at the opposite ends of the balance beam Each protagonist has one friend (Eddie and Kaya respectively) whos even more unbelievably sweet and nice (and therefore un-luckier in love) than they are and another friend whos a reckless hell-raiser (Brandon and Alexa) out to further his/her own interests. The most resounding thuds in ""From Justin to Kelly"" however come from the musical numbers. Prior to moviemaking Iscove cut his teeth on choreography apprenticing under Michael Bennett; but the dancing here (choreographed by Travis Payne) while accomplished consists of the same cookie-cutter gyrations seen in countless contemporary musicvideos. Ditto for the shooting and editing of the numbers -- that make too much use of a roving Steadicam. From Justin to KellyProductionA 20th Century Fox release of a 19 Entertainment production.

Starring Kelly Clarkson Justin Guarini and Greg Siff. Directed by Robert Iscove. Written by Simon Fuller. (PG. 80 minutes. At Metreon Century Plaza 10 AMC 1000 and Century 20.) If a feature film absolutely had to be made out of those two ""American Idols"" Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini a spring break musical was probably as good a choice as any. Just as in the long-ago days of ""Beach Blanket Bingo "" this is the kind of surfin safari where the whole darn gang is likely to erupt in song and dance at the drop of a beach towel. ""From Justin to Kelly"" may be right out of the Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello scrapbook but thats not the movie they are making here. This is more like ""Pygmalion"" attempting to prove that with good lighting a careful wardrobe and a frothy script anyone can be transformed into a movie star. Certainly Clarkson and Guarini -- she was the winner of the first ""American Idol"" and he was the runner-up -- are unlikely big-screen heartthrobs. Kellys outfits draw attention away from those problem areas in her figure and Justins willowy frame doesnt rate a single shot with his shirt off -- maybe the only guy in the movie who doesnt have one. But thats not their appeal. ""American Idol"" was a hit because the contestants stood and belted out showcase songs and because winners like Kelly and Justin seemed as wholesome as the day is long. The good news Thats all still true. There is plenty of belting although the tunes are mostly forgettable and the two ""Idols"" are as squeaky clean as ever. Not only is there no sex it takes them over an hour to lock lips. There is almost no objectionable language the bikinis while skimpy stay on and hardly anyone even takes a sip of alcohol. Hey if spring break were really like this parents would be recruiting their kids to go. The bad news This is such a flimsy framework for a story that its a chore to stay interested. Kelly (played by Kelly) and Justin (played by Justin) meet cute on the beach. You can tell it is love at first sight because the entire beach joins them in a dance number. But there is a huge misunderstanding and Kelly and Justin are torn apart. Do you wonder if they will learn the real story? Will they get back together before the end of spring break? You havent seen many of these have you? Meanwhile Kellys friends -- the thoughtful ethnic one and the snotty blond one -- and Justins friends -- the cocky studly one and the clueless nerdy one -- drop into the usual cookie-cutter spots in the script. It isnt spoiling anything to say that each finds love in his or her own way by the end of the movie. But the lines may have you wincing. When the two meet for the first time Clarksons character says ""My friends call me Kelly for short."" Short for what? Actually nonbelievers who were dragged to the movie by ""American Idol"" fanatics may get a snicker when one of the characters refers to the curly- haired Justin as ""Sideshow Bob."" Thats dangerously close to blasphemy to the faithful. And after all thats who this is for. ""American Idol"" was a breakout TV success with some 50 million viewers tuning in for the final showdown between Justin and Kelly. So that canny Simon Fuller whose snarky comments as a judge are carefully calculated to fuel the interest in the show he created figured a movie was the next logical step. The true believers love Justin and Kelly -- and lets admit it they really can sing -- and may very well flock to the theaters to see this sugary confection. But if it doesnt work theres another ""American Idol"" twosome to market from this years show. Lets see how can we get Ruben and Clay to meet cute?

"American Eye-dull -- Justin Kelly On Screen - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Nicer American Eye-dull -- Justin Kelly On ScreenMOVIE REVIEWJune 21 2003|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticChicago may have revived the movie musical but From Justin to Kelly could bury it again.Not content to be our American Idol darlings Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson are taking a swing at the silver screen -- a swing and sadly a miss.Its a spring-break musical set in South Florida where Kelly a toothsome kewpie doll from Texas and Justin a curly-haired Pennsylvanian have come for fun in the sun.Through some cheesy plot contrivance they meet in a womens bathroom where its love at first well lets say sight.""We had a very nice connection in that bathroom"" Justin later recalls describing the luminous experience to a buddy. You can tell that screenwriter Kim Fuller possesses the soul of a poet.As romantic as that may sound there is trouble in this sandy paradise.Icy-blond Alexa Kellys calculating chum wants Justin for herself. So she keeps throwing roadblocks in the new couples path meanwhile throwing herself at the dude.It would be easier to care about the fate of Justin and Kellys relationship if they had an ounce of chemistry between them. These kids are not so much Frankie and Annette as Donny and Marie.Their big kissing scene holds a lurid fascination You almost feel youre watching something unseemly.In fact the entire movie is vaguely unsettling.Guarini and Clarkson seem to be working very hard which is not quite the same thing as acting. They both have very strong singing voices which is not quite the same thing as being entertaining.Robert Iscove directs in that awful MTV style that chops up the dance scenes and makes it impossible to tell if anyone can really dance. Actually if the dancing is anything like the acting this may be a blessing.The supporting cast includes Katherine Bailess as the despicable Alexa and Anika Noni Rose as Kaya a nicer Kelly friend whos sweet on a local restaurant worker.Cast as Justins buds -- a k a the ""Pennsylvania Posse"" -- are Greg Siff as the buff sometimes shirtless Brandon and Brian Dietzen as the nerdy bespectacled lactose-intolerant Eddie.Brandon keeps getting busted by a pretty beach cop who may have more on her mind than legal infractions. Eddie meanwhile searches everywhere for a chat-room sweetie whom hes never met.A lot of the humor if that is the word involves tripping falling spilling sticky drinks on someones head spraying whipped cream in someones face and shooting hot sauce onto someones lap.Your usual Noel Coward routine.If this is starting to sound mean just imagine what Simon Cowell would say. Imagining what hed say in fact might help you make it through a film as lame as From Justin to Kelly.

Rated PG-13 (vague sexuality). At the Empire the Chelsea West the Union Square others. FROM Justin to Kelly"" a quickie attempt to wring a few more bucks from last years ""American Idol"" finalists is arguably the most insipid movie released so far this century. Kelly Clarkson who won the TV talent competition and stars as a young woman named Kelly recently defended Twentieth Century Foxs decision to dump this lame cross between ""Grease"" and ""Where the Boys Are"" into theaters without advance critics screenings. ""I can tell you right now that none of the critics are going to like this movie"" she told TV Guide. ""Theyre going to tear into it."" Right on the first count Kelly; wrong on the second. To truly tear into a movie it first has to engage you however negatively. ""From Justin to Kelly"" is the movie equivalent of general anesthetic; the handful of unwary civilians emerging from yesterdays first show at the Union Square looked like they had just awoken from a very deep sleep. The only visceral reaction to this innocuous movie is likely to come from teenage boys who have been diverted from ""Hulk"" by their girlfriends in favor of this innocuous (and sexless) piece of fluff which was originally scheduled to hit the video shelves in a mere six weeks (Fox backed off after protests from theater owners). Oh yes there is a plot to this movie a squeaky-clean romance between the big-voiced Kelly and Justin Guarini the big-voiced and big-haired young man whom she beat for the ""American Idol"" title. He plays Justin who travels with his ""Pennsylvania Posse"" - the scheming Brandon (Greg Siff) and the nerdy Eddie (Brian Dietzen) - to Fort Lauderdale for spring break where they are promoting a PG-rated whipped-cream bikini contest and a ""margarita madness"" event where no one drinks much less gets drunk. Kelly meanwhile is visiting from Texas with her bitchy blond pal Alexa (Katherine Bailess) and nice black pal Kaya (Anika Noni Rose). Sparks fly as soon as soon as Kelly meets Justin - in the script anyway if not on the screen - but jealous Alexa schemes to keep them apart with phony e-mail messages. Brandon meanwhile keeps getting busted by a sexy cop; Eddie keeps failing to connect with an Internet blind date; and Kaya pursues a Hispanic dishwasher. Exciting stuff. Kelly and Justin take a boat ride around Miami where they have this immortal exchange Kelly ""So do you bring all the girls out here? Justin ""No I mostly come out here to think."" Kelly ""What are you thinking about now?"" Justin ""How happy I am you gave me a second chance"" This drivel was fabricated by Kim Fuller who wrote ""Spice World"" and is the sister of ""American Idol"" creator Simon Fuller who takes an executive producing credit on this movie. The direction is by the notorious Robert Iscove who made Freddie Prinze Jr. a star (however briefly) in ""Shes All That"" and added insult to injury with ""Boys and Girls."" The impassive Justin however makes Freddie look like Kevin Spacey by comparison. Vacuous Kelly isnt much better; the acting and the 70s-style choreography would barely pass muster in a high-school production. Both the leads are technicaly better singers than say Renee Zellweger. But their 12 bubble-gum ballads are as instantly forgettable as the movie. Kelly opens it with one called ""I Wont Stand in Line."" That probably wont be necessary to see ""From Justin to Kelly"" which will be available on video in September.

"Idol Movie Sings Lighthearted Tune Of Spring Break - tribunedigital-sunsentinel Home-Collections-Beach Party Idol Movie Sings Lighthearted Tune Of Spring BreakJune 21 2003|By Ed Bark The Dallas Morning NewsAnnette and Frankie they arent. And thats a good thing.From Justin to Kelly the post-American Idol concoction starring Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini is 40 years removed from the similarly contrived Beach Party films with former Mouseketeer Annette Funicello and teen heartthrob Frankie Avalon.Its also about 40 times better which isnt a glowing recommendation. Re-watching Beach Party turns out to be worse than a third-degree sunburn particularly when Annette sings Treat Him Nicely while gazing at her mirror image.From Justin to Kelly -- boys meet girls on Spring Break in Miami -- works 12 listenable tunes into its connect-the-dots plot as Clarkson and Guarini earn a few credits toward their junior thespian degrees under the capable direction of Robert Iscove (Shes All That and ABCs Emmy-nominated remake of Cinderella).Clarkson is first seen singing in a dive Texas bar. Her level-headed character Kelly Taylor quickly joins best pals Alexa (Katherine Bailess) and Kaya (Anika Noni Rose) on a fun n sun trip to the beach. Meanwhile Justin Bell (Guarini) also is good to go with a ""Pennsylvania Posse"" that includes con artist Brandon (Greg Siff) and nerdy Eddie (Brian Dietzen).Its only a matter of time -- perhaps 10 minutes -- before Kelly and Justin lock eyes on the beach. But sexy Alexas foul play keeps their lips at bay until the films homestretch. ""Anytime you need love baby Im on your side"" Justin finally sings to Kelly. Backatcha Curly.Rated PG and actually tamer than that the films frequent musical breaks might leave lots of teenage boys wondering how their girlfriends got them into this instead of The Hulk. From Justin to Kelly is hardly West Side Story but it could be considered a cousin twice removed. Gotta sing gotta dance -- most winningly in an energetic opening production number called The Bounce.Its all smoothly packaged and presented by 19 Entertainment the British company that brought American Idol to these shores and remains firmly in charge of the Kelly/Justin starships. Their first movie together is a better-than-expected diversion that likely wont leave anyone feeling cheap or cheated. No harm no foul -- and a true cinematic giant compared with Beach Party.

Besides it stems from reality-TVs American Idol and the reality bent fizzled on film for Aprils similarly beach-set The Real Cancun. Yet From Justin to Kelly isnt about reality. Its about the entertaining nonreality of traditional movie musicals for which its the first entry since Chicago revived the genre. While its no Chicago it is another breath of fresh air considering the long dearth of films with people bursting into song and dance. Unlike Cancuns spring-break realities of drunken revelry and indiscriminate sex From Justin to Kelly is a throwback to the innocent carefree beach-party movies of the 60s. Its kids talk about hedonism but hardly anyone acts on it especially Justin (2002 American Idol runner-up Justin Guarini) and Kelly (2002 Idol winner Kelly Clarkson). Hes an alleged Lothario who hits Miami with pals Brandon (Greg Siff) a hustler whos sex-hungry but harmless and Eddie (Brian Dietzen) a computer geek who even dresses like a 60s beach nerd. Kelly is a skeptical self-protective Texan who arrives with friends Kaya (Anika Noni Rose) the ""smart girl"" and Alexa (Katherine Bailess) the ""party girl."" For a film that rebukes instant sex From Justin to Kelly has no problem with instant attraction. When our heroes cute-meet in a musical frolic on the sands theyre quickly smitten propelling the feeble plot. Its dramatic tension comes from a wearisome string of misunderstandings all set in motion by selfish Alexa who sees a sea of eager guys but only wants Justin. Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello had similar stumbles in the 60s enabling them to skirt any semblance of carnality. But forget sex sin and surf. From Justin to Kelly is all about earnest boy-girl courtship and buoyant musicality. Clarkson and Guarini are in fine vocal form as the kind of pop posers and bombastic belters that Idol celebrates. With the advantage of studio polishing they sound better than they did on television where they had to sing live. Their co-stars also get brief musical bits and perform quite well. Overwrought power ballads teeter toward melodramatic mush especially a static duet sung on a banal boat ride. But most of the largely original songs are tuneful and infectiously exuberant. Thats largely due to the real star of this film choreographer Travis Payne. His intricate large-cast moves are geared to modern hip-hop yet also evoke the sunny boisterous spirit of Grease. Director Robert Iscove (Shes All That) also shows the right light touch. Though screenwriter Kim Fullers story stalls her dialogue has some comic kick including digs at Guarinis curly globe of hair. ""Im from Texas -- Ive seen bigger"" Clarkson says. Another party animal calls him ""Sideshow Bob."" The acting isnt fabulous but with so much music and so little story it doesnt need to be. By playing closely to their friendly personas Clarkson and Guarini at least havent embarrassed themselves on screen which is more than Madonna or Mariah Carey can truthfully say. Relax Idol fans. The reality of this film is that its much better than expected.
