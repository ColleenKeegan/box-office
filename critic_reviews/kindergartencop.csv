First there was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles then Problem Child and the breakaway smash Home Alone. Now elbowing their way into this months pack of big-gun releases is the film brandishing the mightiest kid-pic credentials of the year Arnold Schwarzeneggers comedy thriller Kindergarten Cop. The awesome success of todays kiddie flicks is easily explainable in terms of demographics A generation of baby boomers now have children of their own and they dont just want movies to take their kids to; they want movies about kids. Yet the trend is also part of something larger a generalized return-to-childhood fever that began to grip our culture in the mid-70s. Thats when Steven Spielberg and George Lucas started transforming American movies into a kind of blissed-out cinematic amusement park a place where you could go not just to be moved or entertained but specifically to become a child again. Of course theres nothing wrong with a little healthy regression. But whats dismaying about so many of todays kiddie-movie blockbusters is the evident degree of calculation that has gone into them. The one quality youd want and expect to find in a movie about children -- innocence -- is often in short supply. If youve seen the trailer for Kindergarten Cop youre probably under the delusion that its a comedy about Arnold Schwarzenegger presiding over a class of lovably unruly 5-year-olds. Well it is -- for about 20 minutes. Arnold a Los Angeles cop is trying to nab a crook whose ex-wife swiped 3 million dollars from him and secretly relocated to Oregon. Attempting to ferret out her new identity Schwarzenegger and his partner (Pamela Reed) hightail it to the Northwest where Arnold for reasons too silly to explain goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher. Are the children funny and adorable? Of course. Too young to be anything but perfectly spontaneous on camera theyre nevertheless portrayed as products of a permissive media-age society who are given to dropping innocent zingers like ""Our mom says our dad is a real sex machine."" The strange thing about Kindergarten Cop is how quickly it abandons its own concept. No sooner has Arnold gotten into class than hes yanked back into the mechanics of the movies generic thriller plot. Perhaps this wouldnt be as noticeable if there were a few more sparks between Schwarzenegger and the kids. Alas he never quite establishes a rapport with them. Director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters) cant seem to decide whether the movies central joke is that the kids are impossible brats or that Arnold with his amusingly Teutonic personality is too much of an imposing authoritarian to relate to anyone that small. Kindergarten Cop is pleasantly innocuous and it benefits from a crack supporting cast including Linda Hunt as the school principal Jim Morrison look-alike Richard Tyson as the dim-witted thug Carroll Baker as his domineering mother and Penelope Ann Miller as the sexiest grade-school teacher in history. Yet the movie never quite gels. My guess is that Kindergarten Cop is not going to generate quite the mega-hit business their producers are counting on. Then again in an era when movies about babies regularly outgross movies about adults anything is possible.

The polished comic vision that gave Twins Arnold Schwarzeneggers comedy breakthrough a storybook shine completely eludes director Ivan Reitman here. Result is a mish-mash of violence psycho-drama and lukewarm kiddie comedy [story by Murray Salem]. Schwarzenegger plays a stoic unfriendly and ultra-dedicated LA cop obsessed with putting away a murderous drug dealer (Richard Tyson). He needs the testimony of Tysons ex-wife whos supposedly living in Oregon on piles of drug money she stole from Tyson. Plan is for Schwarzeneggers goofy gal-pal partner (Pamela Reed) to infiltrate the kindergarden as a teacher and figure out which kid is Tysons but when Reed gets a bad stomach flu Schwarzenegger has to report for the job. Its supposed to be wildly funny to have this grim musclebound control freak confronted with five-year-olds he cant intimidate but it isnt. Schwarzenegger has to carry the pic alone; he never finds his focus. Reed takes a good feisty stab at holding up her corner of the pic and Penelope Ann Miller is fittingly sweet and vulnerable as the single mother who romances Schwarzenegger.

"Kindergarten Cop (PG-13) Kindergarten Cop (PG-13) By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer December 21 1990 In only eight years ""Conan the Barbarian"" has become ""Kindergarten Cop."" Following a trend as surely as an echo trails a yodeler Arnold Schwarzenegger has traded his sword for a glue stick and his characteristic snarl for a milk mustache. And like it or not hes teaching your kids. A reunion for Schwarzenegger and ""Twins"" director Ivan Reitman ""Kindergarten Cop"" is packaged to sell tickets. Part cop caper part coo-fest it is a feel-good movie a jolly little button-pusher about a street-smart cop who brings law and order to a classroom full of unruly but adorable youngsters. Whether they are abused neglected or let down by the school system all they really need he finds is a little military-school training. Reitman who built ""Twins"" around the difference between Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVitos sizes again partners his galoot of a Gulliver with various Lilliputians. Aside from the 30 tykes there is petite Pamela Reed as his spunky partner and elfin Linda Hunt as the principal of the elementary school where he goes undercover to catch a villain. One of his young charges is the son of an Oedipally fixated drug dealer (Richard Tyson) who plans to kidnap the youngster. But which one is he? ""Ve are goink to play Who ess my daddy and vat does he do? "" says Arnold to the children who take him quite literally and start making guesses as to what his daddy does. Arnold gradually falls in love with teaching a third-grade teacher (Penelope Ann Miller) and the kindergartners themselves but not before they test his mettle with their shenanigans. His partner was supposed to handle the teaching but shes come down with the flu on the trip from L.A. to Astoria Ore. where the villain is bound. ""Theyre only 6-year-olds. How much trouble can they be?"" he asks. ""On second thought take the gun"" she advises. A Hun humbled by his energetic class he first caters to their whims but then discovers discipline. He teaches the children to march to hold their water and to respond to whistled commands. Though Schwarzenegger remains to acting what ham hocks are to a cheese course he manages against all odds to be appealing as the Austrian au pair. Think of it as ""To Conan With Love."" ""Kindergarten Cop"" is rated PG-13 and contains some violence and scenes that are potentially frightening to youngsters.

"Kindergarten Cop (PG-13) Kindergarten Cop (PG-13) By Joe Brown Washington Post Staff Writer December 21 1990 Youve probably noticed by now that were currently chafing under a rash of movies about kids. After the baby boomlet of the late 80s tyke-centered scripts look likely to be the ""high concept"" of the 90s. ""Kindergarten Cop"" which playfully pits live-action figure Arnold Schwarzenegger against a classroom full of hyperanimated tots is likely to prove the pick of the litter. Cute with a capital K with a premise as fresh as a new pencil case (as cop movies go) it should give ""Home Alone"" ""Three Men and a Little Lady"" and ""Look Whos Talking Too"" a run for your holiday bucks. But heres a caveat Though ""Kindergarten Cop"" is made to look quite cuddly in the ads parents may deem it too graphically and casually violent for kid consumption with drug dealing murder child abuse and kidnapping situated matter-of-factly amid the gleeful kids n cops chaos. Schwarzenegger plays hard-guy L.A. detective John Kimble who has been hounding ultra-bad guy Cullen Crisp (Richard Tyson) a murderous drug dealer for a long time. It turns out that Tyson is obsessed with locating his kindergarten-aged son who Mom spirited away after divorcing his deranged and dangerous daddy. In order to catch Tyson Schwarzenegger and partner Pamela Reed -- a former teacher -- are sent undercover to Astoria Ore. where Tysons family is living incognito. But when Reed gets sick Schwarzenegger has no choice but to fill in facing his toughest assignment unarmed. ""Its like the ocean"" one teacher warns him. ""You dont want to turn your back on it."" Schwarzenegger proves artful at finding ways of interrogating the kids in hopes of finding Tysons son. And cribbing a bit from his role as chairman of the Presidents Council on Physical Fitness and Sports the script has Arnold bark ""You kids are soft . . . its time now to turn this mush into muscles"" as he makes them over into an ace fire-drill squad. Director Ivan Reitman who last engineered a Schwarzenegger performance in ""Twins"" makes more of ""Kindergarten Cop"" than just a novel situation (theres more than a touch of ""Twin Peaks"" in Astorias small-town ambiance). Hes got a way with kids and found a remarkable ensemble of 30 antic urchins to work with cashing in on kindergartens comic terrain and the blurted brutal honesty of the kids. The contrast between the stubbly mirror-shaded Arnold plowing ""Terminator""-style through malls and nightclubs and the clean-shaven polo-shirted Arnold maneuvering a Hula-Hoop before milk-and-cookies time is rich. The Great Stone Man never looks more alien than when he smiles but the expression starts to become him and as he grows more human through his contact with the kids Schwarzenegger begins to exude actual warmth. He also has a nicely tart rapport with flip assistant Reed. Penelope Ann Miller a third-grade teacher and mom who has eyes for Schwarzenegger goes a little overboard in her quest for adorableness. Tyson however is eminently hissable as the psycho-daddy with an unwholesome Oedipal thing for his own mom played by grown-up ""Baby Doll"" Carroll Baker.
