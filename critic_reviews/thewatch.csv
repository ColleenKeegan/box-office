Proving once again that its a terrible terrible idea for loud movie Americans to traipse around former Soviet backwaters ""Theyre Watching"" finds a reality-TV crew in way over their heads in a tiny Moldavian hamlet with a not-so-distant history of witch burning. Neither very plausible nor scary this found-footage exercise is nonetheless entertaining enough for a spell and the writing-directing duo of Jay Lender (a ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" animation vet) and Micah Wright (hitherto primarily a video-game writer) clearly dont intend for it to be taken too seriously. Horror fans will be divided on whether the hectic finale makes it or breaks it. Amplify four-walled the pic on 10 U.S. screens starting Friday simultaneous with the VOD release that will doubtless provide its principal returns. After a short flash-forward to the end -- revealing that at least one characters fate involves the business end of an ax -- we get a fleeting half-episode of the fictional worldwide home-improvement show ""Home Hunters Global"" (definitely to be confused with the long-running ""House Hunters Intl.""). In it host Kate Banks (Carrie Genzel) introduces us to Becky (Brigid Brannagh) a chirpy Los Angeles potter whos decided to leave the big city for a serious fixer-upper in Moldova the homeland of her pro-soccer-player boyfriend Goran (Cristian Balint). Moldova is called an ""affordable gem"" of a country for moneyed Westerners though ""cheap and creepy"" better describes what the reality show captures. The house Becky has bought is well outside the nearest small town hasnt been inhabited for many years and is about as clean as a neglected stable. ""Home Hunters Global"" promises to check back with her in six months to see what shes managed. Half a year later the shrewish Kate nice-guy cameraman Greg (David Alpay) and snarky-jerk sound guy Alex (Kris Lemche) are reluctantly back this time accompanied by fresh-out-of-film-school Sarah (Mia Faith) who scored an assistant job by dint of being the bosss niece. Theyre greeted by Vladimir (Dimitri Diatchenko) the slimy local real-estate agent who finessed Beckys original purchase. The natives send alternately threatening and warning signals to the visitors who dont help by causing great offense on several occasions in classic ugly-American fashion. It seems hereabouts they not only dislike strangers in general but are very touchy about a certain alleged witch blamed for various ills a century ago. She was burned at the stake outside a home that might very well be Beckys new spread. That manse has indeed gone from grunge palace to showplace during the crews hiatus. But for reasons of her own Kate is most eager to get this episode wrapped and trip over with as soon as possible browbeating her irked crew to that end. Unfortunately by the time theyre close to finished the villagers no longer appear willing to let them leave -- alive or otherwise. A lively pace entertaining performances and decent sense of humor keep ""Theyre Watching"" watchable even while nothing much happens in horror terms for a long time beyond ominous exchanges with eerily omnipresent surly villagers. When the rahat (Romanian being spoken here) finally does hit the fan theres a not-entirely-surprising turnabout in terms of who/what the real menace is. The climax is a pileup of energetic if silly mayhem whose semi-cheesy CGI f/x probably arent intended to be ""convincing"" and in any case arent. Shot in Moldovas larger neighbor Romania the pic is competently packaged. Its desultory attitude toward pulling off the found-footage conceit is underlined by somewhat half-hearted use of a background score by Jonathan Wandag.

Martin Olson says July 2 2016 at 446 pm I agree with a lot of that. I just saw this film and was pleasantly surprised at its intelligent wit and well-crafted eccentric structure. I disagree about the ending though which I though was surprisingly frightening very ballsy and well shockingly good. It reminded me of a low-budget version of CABIN IN THE WOODS in many ways. Impressive and fun film-making by some outrageous guys for sure. Not for everyone.

"Review Horror-comedy Theyre Watching has a good foundation but needs a rehab - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Horror-comedy Theyre Watching has a good foundation but needs a rehab ""Theyre Watching"" Best Served Cold Productions Mia Faith in the movie ""Theyre Watching."" Mia Faith in the movie ""Theyre Watching."" (Best Served Cold Productions) Noel Murray The found-footage horror-comedy ""Theyre Watching"" imagines what would happen if a ""House Hunters International""-style reality show brought crews to a spooky old Eastern European village populated by unfriendly locals and ancient evil. But the movie doesnt do justice to a promising premise. A scarcity of laughs and scares limits this propertys curb appeal.Writer-directors Micah Wright and Jay Lender -- two first-time feature-filmmakers who cut their teeth on Nickelodeon and Disney animated series -- barely maintain the illusion that what theyre presenting is ""real."" Though the actors improvise a lot of the dialogue theyre polished and attractive in ways that dont scream ""documentary."" SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;The cast is also meant to be more fleshed-out than the average first-person horror victims though that means Wright and Lender have written them as generic young hotties rather than complete blanks. Despite its more professional sheen ""Theyre Watching"" still succumbs to some of the worst traits of the found-footage mockumentary. The movie waits until almost halfway through its running time before introducing anything even remotely exciting. In the interim characters goof around shooting the kind of random shaky footage -- ruined by incessant chatter -- that could never be used in a TV home improvement show.Ultimately the most frustrating thing about ""Theyre Watching"" is that Wright and Lender quickly abandon the ""House Hunters goes wrong"" idea and end up making a straightforward special-effects-driven supernatural thriller -- albeit with terrible camera angles and not much of a script.-------------Theyre WatchingNo ratingRunning time 1 hour 34 minutesPlaying Laemmle Monica Film Center Santa Monica and AMC Burbank Town Center 8.

Credit Amplify Releasing ""Theyre Watching"" a horror film by Micah Wright and Jay Lender does a commendable amount with very little using an amusing premise to separate itself from much of the genres low-budget fare.Anyone who has squandered time watching one of those dumb home-improvement reality programs will recognize ""Home Hunters Global"" the fictional show that sends a film crew to a village in Moldova where it follows an American expatriate named Becky (Brigid Brannagh) as she buys a wreck of a fixer-upper. Its when the crew returns six months later to see how the fixing up has progressed that the creepiness of this particular village becomes evident.Found-footage films which is what this essentially is sometimes strain to come up with a reason to explain why people being subjected to horrific things are filming their ordeal. But the premise here provides the necessary license -- of course a reality-TV crew will have the cameras running at all times. Kris Lemche and David Alpay play the veteran cameramen Mia Faith is the young newbie on their crew and Carrie Genzel plays the humorless boss. The four characters are so preoccupied with insult-hurling petty politics and simmering romance that they arent fully on guard against the possibility that theyve stumbled into a village full of malevolent forces.The storytelling becomes muddled in the middle and the suspense doesnt build as well as it ought to but the winking undercurrent keeps the film watchable. When all heck finally breaks loose at that fixer-upper the gore is delivered with flair.

Watch out for the hatchet. Rating 1 star out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer Greetings from Moldova. Where surly locals stare sullenly at stupid strangers. Where the traditional regional greeting extended to said strangers is a hatchet in the forehead. Fun times in Eastern Europe in ""Theyre Watching"" Ill tell ya. What we have here is a horror movie with all the expected trimmings Rumors of witchcraft. An isolated house way out in the middle of spooky woods where no one can hear you ... well you know how that goes. Mobs of angry peasants brandishing torches and bad intentions. And that ever-popular hatchet in the forehead. Movie Review    Theyre Watching with David Alpay Brigid Brannagh Kris Lemche Mia Faith Carrie Genzel Dimitri Diatchenko. Written and directed by Jay Lender and Micah Wright. 94 minutes. Not rated; for mature audiences. Pacific Place. The stupid strangers in this instance are members of a U.S. camera crew working for one of those home-fixer-upper shows that clutter cable like crab grass. They come to film that lonely house out in the boonies where an expat American woman (Brigid Brannagh) has done a great job of spiffing the place up.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Only a handful of found-footage horror movies in the past few years have connected with either audiences or critics to the point where those few genuine successes have represented some degree of experimentation like last years M. Night Shyamalan-orchestrated The Visit or the desktop-based Unfriended. But less inventive found-footage horror movies still get churned out on a regular basis and rather than having the intended effect of increasing the naturalism and immediacy of the genre they now mostly ensure that if a horror movies protagonists arent a family besieged by ghosts theyre a camera crew rocking some degree of filmmakers arrogance. It makes sense that budding filmmakers would be drawn to these metatextual movies about the real-time making of horror movies. It also makes sense that plenty of people watching those movies could not care less about these characters or what happens to them.Theyre Watching at least attempts to incorporate filmmaking into its story more organically than some other found-footage pictures though that also means it must chronicle the adventures of a bunch of callow camerapeople. After a quick introduction in the midst of typical climactic horror mayhem the movie cuts straight into an episode of Home Hunters Global an obvious (if not especially eagle-eyed) riff on the actual television program House Hunters International complete with brightly colored graphics bite-sized talking-head interviews and an awkwardly inserted reference to the site of a witch burning for some clumsy portent. The shows subject is Becky (Brigid Brannagh) who plans to renovate a rundown building in remote Pavlovka (treated as a generic Eastern European location though it is the name of a real place in Russia).Months later Home Hunters host Kate (Carrie Genzel) returns to Pavlovka to film the post-renovation follow-up segment with her camera-toting crew Greg (David Alpay) the blandly sensitive one; Alex (Kris Lemche) the louche wiseass; and Sarah (Mia Faith) a recent film-school grad along with their guide Vladimir (Dimitri Diatchenko). Greg Alex and Sarah are supposed to offer multiple opportunities for point-of-view footage by each carrying a different camera. Theyre also supposed to be professionals which makes their constant use of company equipment to capture their own lame wisecracks gossip and light inter-employee sniping not just contrived but positively foolhardy.The endless shooting leads to a few meta touches as when the more experienced Greg and Alex talk to Sarah about how to use handheld shots without making audience members sick. Cleverness this fleeting though is no substitute for interesting characters and these three transparently function as ongoing excuses for the movies format. ""We film everything from here on out"" one of them says an hour into a movie where theyve been filming everything the entire time. With the movie distracted by these logistical concerns its attempts at human interest like Gregs labored backstory involving a past wartime assignment becomes superfluous bordering on exploitative. (His history is also introduced with a bizarre quip ""The only thing that man shot in Afghanistan was the news"" Alex says early on apparently operating under the assumption that embedded journalism is on some level an act of shameful cowardice.)With the characters dispatched by the screenplay long before their fates are officially sealed on screen Theyre Watching would have to deliver top-notch or at least medium-notch scares and suspense to really work. But for the first half of the movie the horror elements sink into the background with tedious routine crones standing and staring villagers with axes commotion caused at the mere mention of the word ""witch."" Its not scary and not goofy enough to be funny. By the time co-writers and co-directors Jay Lender and Michah Wright deliver a serviceable if semi-predictable twist the movie has lost any chance at an effective build-up.Theyre Watchings climactic protracted sprint through a haunted-house gauntlet has some more life to it though with that life comes a litany of low-budget (if brightly colored) special effects. More desperate than the CG gore though is the movies mistaken impression that it works as satire. Is the film savaging cable TV? Ethically challenged filmmakers? Found-footage horror itself? If the intent was to finish off this subgenre by exposing the rote mechanics behind it the mission is only halfway accomplished.

A professional cameraman gives that advice to a new crew member in Theyre Watching and in the same moment reassures the audience that its in good hands -- found footage or not this isnt some bargain-basement wobblethon. The pair work for a home improvement show on location to see how new homeowner Becky (sunny Brigid Brannagh) has spruced up a cottage she bought in the Moldovan hinterlands. The TV crew is a likable if privileged bunch but certain members ignorance causes friction in the village. Film Details Theyre Watching RatingNR GenreComedy Running Time95 min. More Info Trailer EXPAND Their local fixer Vladimir (imbued with shady clownishness by Dimitri Diatchenko) tries to smooth things over but on the next days shoot the woods are full of surly townspeople; before too long the first body is found. Writer-directors Micah Wright and Jay Lender are kids-cartoon vets and show a facility for comedy on a more human level here -- as does the nimble cast which ably handles the tonal shift from travel nightmare to actual nightmare. And the film carries us right along when it gleefully swerves into another style of horror in its final act having laid the groundwork for that too.Theyre Watching Written and directed by Micah Wright and Jay Lender Amplify Releasing Opens March 25 Cinema Village Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Rob Staeger Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.
