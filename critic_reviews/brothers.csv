This noble but flat American remake of Susanne Biers 2004 Danish film about the domestic fallout of foreign campaigns sits drably in the middle of the bunch. Though well-meaning with its apolitical and humane perspective its also ordinary forgettable and saddled with an entire section set abroad thats unnecessary and damaging to the films overall effect. Tobey Maguire is Sam a blue-collar US Marine wife to Grace (Natalie Portman) father to two young daughters and brother to Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is fresh out of jail a bit of a waster but essentially a softie who is forever bullied by his father (Sam Shepard) a damaged Vietnam vet. After Sam heads to Afghanistan hes soon missing presumed dead (we see a superfluous scene of a helicopter crashing). Back home the family attends a military funeral and soon Grace is reassessing her frosty attitude towards Tommy as he helps her with parenting and putting her life back in order - a process that is blown out of the water by a turn of events thats unexpected by all involved yet revealed to us much earlier. This would be a far better and certainly more daring film if director Jim Sheridan had stuck with Graces perspective throughout and allowed us to experience life as she does. The frustrating thing about Brothers is that Sheridan back on more familiar turf after the frankly weird anomaly of the 50 Cent movie Get Rich or Die Tryin  gives his actors and story more than enough room to breathe by adopting a calm observational shooting style and allowing scenes to run naturally and find their feet. Its just that they never do. It takes two-thirds of the film for any scene of real emotional truth or power to emerge - and by then were lost shaking our heads at a missed opportunity to avoid the middle-of-the-road treatment that the presence of U2 and ample soft rock on the soundtrack always threatened.

By David Denby Christopher Plummer and Helen Mirren as the Tolstoys in Michael Hoffmans movie.   Credit Illustration by Barry Blitt In ""The Last Station"" Christopher Plummer at the crest of a long career gives an impassioned portrait of the artist as an old man--Leo Tolstoy in his eighties imposing stentorian and almost alarmingly active. Helen Mirren letting her age show and still the most sexual actress onscreen is his equal as Sofya Tolstoys wife of forty-eight years. Like Tolstoy Sofya is built along heroic Old Testament lines she has borne him thirteen children; she has copied out ""War and Peace"" in longhand six times; she has run his household and loves him as passionately as ever. Based on Jay Parinis 1990 novel which draws heavily on diaries kept by the couple and by other men and women in their circle this production directed by Michael Hoffman is like a great night at the theatre--the two performing demons go at each other full tilt and produce scenes of Shakespearean affection chagrin and rage. The year is 1910 and Tolstoy is an uneasy survivor in the new century--hes bemused by a phonograph playing in his garden at Yasnaya Polyana. (A fine old house in Germany doubles as the estate.) As he approaches death he and Sofya fight over his will. Shall he leave the vastly profitable copyrights of his worldly masterpieces to his wife and their children? Or shall he bequeath them to the ""Russian people"" to be administered by an organization that propagates his late-in-life obsessions--a cultish neo-Christian neo-socialist religion that runs communes advocates passive resistance to violence and renounces sexuality? Sofyas nemesis in the struggle is Tolstoys chief disciple and administrator the fanatical Chertkov (Paul Giamatti) who introduces into the estate a youthful spy Valentin (James McAvoy) a celibate and an avowed Tolstoyan who becomes the writers secretary. Hes so awed that he can barely get a word out when he and Tolstoy first meet but his disapproval of the flesh disappears overnight after Masha (Kerry Condon) a terrifically flirtatious and intelligent fellow-acolyte climbs into his bed. Hoffman makes the scenes between the young lovers genuinely erotic so its not hard to guess which side the movie chooses in the philosophical dispute between asceticism and sensuality. Hoffman doesnt parody Tolstoys religious and pedagogical beliefs which after all exerted a major influence on Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. yet the movie implicitly suggests that exalted self-denying spirituality however noble is less powerful as a guide to living than everyday love. Tolstoy no fanatic in his own cause seems to know this. In a beautifully written scene played with wistful longing by Plummer the old man talking to Valentin as they sit together in the forest at Yasnaya Polyana describes the early years of his marriage as a kind of terrifying paradise. Hoffmans career has wandered all over the place--he made the uproarious pop comedy ""Soapdish"" in 1991 and a mediocre ""Midsummer Nights Dream"" in 1999. In this movie he achieves a new expressiveness fluidity and power. ""The Last Station"" may not be original in form but its vibrantly alive with many scenes of scathing directness that seem to come straight out of Russian novels (though the pitch of feeling is closer to Dostoyevskys hyperthyroid manner than to Tolstoys firmer calmer tone). The juiciest material is Sofyas detestation of Chertkov whose celibacy she suspects is really just a cover for homosexuality. In any case shes sure that hes a poseur and an opportunist disguising his self-seeking with a veneer of piety. And for her Tolstoys anti-sensual bent is rubbish--this is a man of huge lusts who showed her his diaries of youthful whoring before their wedding. Sofyas situation is pitiable she still wants her husband sexually and will do anything to lure him back to bed and destroy his ideological purity. Helen Mirren may be the only actress who can beg for sex without losing a ferocious pride. Her Sofya dressed in white like a bride her hair long and full makes scenes howls and gets thrown about by her own anger and desire like a rag doll in a storm. Its the most emotionally naked work of Mirrens movie career; she gives poetic form to the madness and the violence of commonplace jealousy. Her look of pleading and then of tenderness toward Plummer is heartbreaking. Plummer who is turning eighty himself effortlessly suggests largeness of spirit even in foolish old age. Physically he seems enormous. His eyes devour McAvoys Valentin--his Tolstoy is hungry for information about everyone. He doesnt see why he has to choose between his wife and his followers; he wants everyones love and Sofya makes life at the estate complete hell. For him there is no peace except in flight and in death. In all the movie is worthy of its valiant pair. The splendor and the amplitude of Yasnaya Polyana affirm in every scene the magnificence of the sensuous world that Tolstoy with ambiguous energy and many fond backward glances so desperately wants to renounce. Theres another piece of extraordinary acting knocking about in the crowded Christmas season. What Jeff Bridges pulled off as a joke in ""The Big Lebowski"" lazing like a walrus he does seriously in ""Crazy Heart."" As Bad Blake a well-travelled country singer hes a barely functioning mess with a ratty beard and ponytail a large belly and a constant cigarette and glass of bourbon. Bad was once a famous performer and songwriter and hes written for other people including the darkly handsome young country sensation Tommy Sweet (Colin Farrell) who openly acknowledges him as a mentor. But now Bad drives alone through vast stretches of the Southwest drifting from saloon to bowling alley performing with ragged pickup bands. He can still sing a little though he may not make it through a set without exiting the stage to go heave in an alley. The rest of the time he lies on his back in a squalid motel. As an actor Bridges luxuriates in indolence but Bad unlike the sublime Dude in ""Lebowski"" is not pleased with himself. Hes played out and past caring and Bridges muttering in a crabbed voice suggests a formidable intelligence fighting through a fog of drink and sloth. Bridges takes the character to the pits but hes spiritually active there at the bottom; he knows that Bad has to be shrewd and still proud in defeat or the audience would find him contemptible. Maggie Gyllenhaal ardent her round face glowing turns up as Jean Craddock a journalist and a single mother who penetrates the gloom of Bads motel room for an interview. At the start his attitude toward her is wary and distant but hes stirred by her interest and her loneliness. The first-time director Scott Cooper working from a novel by Thomas Cobb keeps the camera close to these two and the way that Bridges and Gyllenhaal ease into an affair--drawing together pulling back and starting again--feels right. Jean who must also look after her four-year-old son wakes up the decrepit singer but this is not a movie about miracles. Nor is ""Crazy Heart"" quite a miracle itself. It has a gentle unforced rhythm and whats there is good and true. But theres not enough of it--the movie needs more plot more complication more conflict--and it suffers from the mood of weary resignation embedded in Bads songs whose general theme is ""What the hell nothing can be done about it."" If ever a movie demonstrated how country music emerges from private sorrows this is it. But something can always be done to make a movie better. ""Brothers"" the new home-from-the-war film written by David Benioff and directed by Jim Sheridan has been made with obvious devotion and sincerity and I wish I could take it seriously. The movie is based on the 2004 Danish film ""Brodre"" but it feels like a 1948 Arthur Miller play without Millers toughness. Sam Shepard plays a dominating alcoholic father a former marine who has long tormented his two sons turning one Sam (Tobey Maguire) into a high achiever both athlete and war hero dutifully serving multiple tours in Afghanistan; and the other Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) into a resentful unemployable screwup. When Sam is captured his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) believing that hes dead leans toward Tommy who pulls himself together and helps her raise her and Sams two young children. Then Sam returns nearly destroyed by what he had to do to survive in Afghanistan. Will he be capable of resuming his marriage? Theres not much rooting interest for us since Maguire and Portman dont go together in the first place. Hes humorless and ungainly and odd-looking in his high-and-tight military haircut; shes elfin and flawlessly pretty and unconvincing as an ex-cheerleader turned mother of two and they dont set off the dimmest of sparks in each other. With the exception of Jake Gyllenhaal whose shambling self-disgust hits the only genuine note the movie is a classic of Hollywood miscasting and ambition gone askew. Maguire playing crazy when Sam comes home opens his eyes wider and wider as if he were trying to pop them out of his head. For three-quarters of an hour or so you wait for him to blow. And blow he does shrieking and smashing things in a display that seems more like pyrotechnics than like acting. To understand how this kind of role can be done with nuance and eloquence see Ben Fosters work in ""The Messenger"" a movie devoted to similar themes but finer in every way. Of all human illusions the hardest to give up is the belief that consciousness exists after death. This may seem a stiffly rational response to anything as shrewdly executed as Alice Sebolds best-selling 2002 novel ""The Lovely Bones"" but it becomes inescapable when you see the bizarre and sentimental movie that Peter Jackson has made from the book. In the movie as in the book Susie (Saoirse Ronan) a fourteen-year-old girl narrates her own murder in 1973 at the hands of a neighborhood creep (Stanley Tucci). Then she watches him cover his tracks and her father (Mark Wahlberg) her mother (Rachel Weisz) and her sister (Rose McIver) try to cope with her death. She is not merely present in their minds; they cant quite see her but she is there prompting warning claiming a kiss from her handsome teen boyfriend. The book was brought off with considerable delicacy--its really an affectionately detailed portrait of a suburban girls life. Literalized in the movie the material is closer to a high-toned ghost story. Jackson intermingles family goings on with Susies gossamer interventions and some of the brushed-with-ether imagery verges on the uncanny. Yet Jackson has become an undisciplined fabulist the movie is redundant and undramatic. Heaven is notoriously harder to make interesting than Hell but Jackson has outdone other artists in cotton candy--there are luscious hills and dales and gleaming lakes and fields of waving grain and sugarplum fairies with music by Brian Eno rather than by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky. ""The Lovely Bones"" has been fashioned as a holiday family movie about murder and grief; its a thoroughly queasy experience. The lesson that Susie has to learn is that she must ""let go"" of her past life. Meanwhile skilled opportunistic artificers like Alice Sebold and Peter Jackson wont let go of a chance to mingle life and death.

Grace (Natalie Portman) her Marine husband Sam (Tobey Maguire) and their two young daughters (Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare) live in one of those patriotic small towns where the Stars and Bars are slapped on every satellite dish. (And where they graduated high school as the head cheerleader and football star.) So too does Sams brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal)--at least sort of. Hes been living in the jail down the road and now freshly released hes decided to hole up in a local motel. When Sams helicopter is shot down in Afghanistan and Grace gets that dreaded visit from two formal Marines everyone is upended. Sams dad (a great Sam Shepard) takes to drink Grace and her girls crumble and Tommys first reaction is to show up wasted and screaming on her doorstep blaming her for allowing Sams second tour of duty. Gyllenhaal anchors the film as a screw-up who slowly fills the vacuum his stand up brother left behind; hes solid complicated and wholly credible. By contrast Portman is a girl playing dress up--Sheridan tries to age her with turtleneck sweaters but shes more believable as a galactic queen than a heartland housewife. When Carey Mulligan (the breakout star of An Education) pops up in a cameo you realize how rich the film would be with her in the lead. But Portman was cast because shes pretty and if youre in any doubt of that screenwriter David Benioff nudges us with lines like ""Oh my God shes so pretty"" The film is apolitical enough for both red and blue staters. War is noble except for when it isnt and when one of the girls says that her daddy is fighting the bad guys with the beards the family smiles without egging her on. It doesnt spoil the film to reveal that Sam survived his crash. What follows both abroad and at home is so wrenching he almost wishes he hadnt--a painful twist the film approaches with the same clear-eyed patience. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

"Natalie Portman ruins Brothers. Slate Sign In Sign Up Natalie Portman ruins Brothers. Natalie Portman ruins Brothers. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 4 2009 431 PM Lets Get Emotional in the Snow Natalie Portman Jake Gyllenhaal and Tobey Maguire in Brothers. By Dana Stevens Tobey Maguire and Natalie Portman in Brothers Brothers (Lionsgate) Jim Sheridans remake of a 2004 Danish film about two siblings separated by war does one thing brilliantly well It casts Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal as brothers. It wasnt until the time Spider-Man 2 came out that I could reliably tell the two apart and the resemblance goes beyond the physical. Both actors have a boyish soft-spoken delivery and a resistance to showboating that serves them well in what could easily be (and occasionally is) a heavy-handed wartime melodrama. And theyre cleverly cast here both for and against type Gyllenhaal the edgier and sexier of the two plays the drunken bad-boy brother whos secretly a standup guy while the delicate guileless-seeming Maguire is a straight-and-narrow Marine whos forced to confront his dark side when hes taken prisoner in Afghanistan. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Schematic yes but the fairy-tale symmetry of that setup has a primal appeal. Unfortunately Brothers also assumes that Natalie Portman is interesting enough to watch suffer for two hours. Here I come up against what Im fully willing to admit may be a personal limitation I cant stand Natalie Portman. Ive never believed her in a single role. She evokes no emotional response in me beyond ""Oh theres Natalie Portman."" She doesnt overact or underact; she just stands around with whatever the appropriate expression for the scene seems to be on her sweet pretty childlike face. If theres something going on behind that face I neither know nor care what it is which means that long stretches of Brothers involving her characters interiority struck me as dramatically inert. If you possess the gene that enables Portman-caring you may find them brilliant. Advertisement So Sam (Maguire) the upstanding Marine brother is sent on a tour of duty in Afghanistan. The boys alcoholic father (Sam Shepard) makes it uncomfortably clear at Sams goodbye dinner that he far prefers his older son to Tommy (Gyllenhaal) a perpetual screw-up whos just gotten out of prison after a pathetic attempt to hold up a bank. When Sam ships out his wife Grace (Portman) takes responsibility for Tommy rescuing him when he racks up bar bills he cant pay off. But Tommy rises to the occasion pitching in to help take care of Grace and Sams young daughters (Taylor Geare and Bailee Madison). Slowly Grace and Tommys once strained relationship develops into a friendship then an attraction though their involvement never goes beyond one marijuana-enabled kiss. When Sams helicopter is shot down over a river his family is told that hes dead but we witness that he and another Marine are taken prisoner and tortured by the Taliban (or maybe al-Qaida--anyway bad guys with beards and turbans). There Sam does something awful--so awful in fact that it makes no sense for his character and feels like a screenwriters contrivance. When hes eventually rescued by U.S. soldiers and sent home he has a case of PTSD that reduces him to an emotional zombie. Too disconnected to play with his children or laugh at family jokes Sam roams the backyard at night with a loaded pistol obsessing about his brothers (nonexistent) affair with his wife. Though Tobey Maguire is as good here as hes ever been--his clenched neck muscles are enough to show us what it would be like to live in a state of constant fear--the love triangle at the heart of Brothers is curiously uninvolving. We know that the pure and selfless Grace would never really betray her husband--her name is Grace for Gods sake Shes played by Natalie Portman--so her scenes with Gyllenhaal lack tension and heat (or maybe thats just my Portman thing again). What emotional resonance the movie delivers comes in the moments involving Sam and Graces little girls. Sheridan has always had a gift for directing children and his treatment of these young actresses rigorously skirts sentimental cuteness. A scene in which the older girl deliberately spoils the younger ones birthday party rings truer than anything that happens among the three adult leads. The earnest and well-intentioned Brothers falls into that category of films about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that turn these overseas conflicts into springboards for domestic drama. (Stop-Loss Rendition and In the Valley of Elah are other examples.) Brothers has nothing more timely to say about war than the fact that going away to fight one can be a really bad experience. This story of fraternal rivalry and spousal temptation could just as easily have been set during WWI when Sams condition would have been known as ""shell shock."" After watching this movie I had what you might call Portman Traumautic Stress Disorder a condition that leaves you twitchy irritable and in need of a well-acted light comedy.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 04 2009 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday May 23 2013 237PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English BrothersDirected by Jim SheridanWritten by David BenioffStarring Tobey Maguire Natalie Portman and Jake GyllenhaalClassification 14AJim Sheridans Brothers  a remake of a film made by Danish director Susanne Bier in 2004 is an almost-good movie weakened by its desire to have a major impact as melodramatic material is heated to boiling over. Built around an intense performance by Tobey Maguire as a emotionally damaged war vet Sheridans film sets itself up if not exactly as this generations answer to Coming Home or TheDeer Hunter  as at least late-season Oscar bait. Maguire plays Sam Cahill a Marine captain and a former star athlete now married to the pretty cheerleader Grace (Natalie Portman). They live in small-town New Mexico with their two adoring young daughters. Sams the favoured son of his Vietnam vet father (Sam Shepard) and doting mom (Mare Winningham). There are a couple of sore spots. Dad is an alcoholic. The other son Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is also a heavy drinker and family embarrassment who we see getting out of jail for bank robbery as the film starts.Directed by Jim Sheridan Brothers stars Jake Gyllenhaal Natalie Portman and Tobey Maguire.Shortly after Sam ships out for his fourth tour of duty in Afghanistan but he has barely arrived when his helicopter is shot down and he is presumed dead. Unexpectedly Tommy responds to the crisis by becoming a better man. He helps Grace who previously disliked and distrusted him to remodel her kitchen with the help of some of his rough friends. He bonds with and comforts her daughters the cute-as-a-button favourite Maggie (Taylor Geare) and the insecure older sibling Isabelle (Bailee Madison) whose sibling dynamic parallels the two brothers. Grace grows to love in some sense the reformed Tommy and even his father comes to see some merit in his son.As it turns out Sam is not dead but has been captured and is being held by the Taliban in an underground pit along with another soldier Private Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger). Eventually hes rescued but hes psychologically broken in the process and comes home riddled with anger and guilt. Hes impatient with his daughters and consumed by a growing jealousy regarding his wife and brother.Sheridan ( My Left Foot In the Name of the Father In America ) is known as an actors director and he pushes the cast here to move beyond their familiar safe zones. Portman as a young woman reacting to one crisis and then another has rarely been as mature and empathetic. Gyllenhaal is completely persuasive as a guy who slides into his black-sheep role as confirmation of his lack of self-worth. Later he blossoms when hes allowed to step out from under his accomplished brothers shadow. Solid support is offered from Shepards bitter but not cruel father with the effortlessly authentic Winningham as his tolerant wife. Sheridan who directed children so well in 2002s In America  also gets unusually resonant performances from the child actors especially Madison.Maguire despite looking too boyish for the athlete/soldier he plays (the Danish actor who played the same part was in his 40s) has powerful moments of ravaged emotional rawness. But then his performance tips into the grotesque Think Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle and maybe some Jake LaMotta thrown in. By the time we reach the explosion point weve already had too many glances at the sizzling fuse - the crooked distracted smiles fixed gazes and puppet-like movements - to be shocked.Theres another reason why Brothers doesnt peak convincingly It tries too hard too early. Though the adaptation by David Benioff ( The Kite Runner ) is essentially faithful to the original script (by Bier and fellow filmmaker Anders Thomas Jensen) the direction and buildup of the story is entirely different.In the Danish version of the film shot in the Dogma style hand-held cameras catch reality on the fly; there was something both harrowing but matter-of-fact about the family turmoil that unfolded. Sheridans film starts ratcheting up the tension early crosscutting busily between Afghanistan and the home front but the Afghanistan sequences are among the weakest in the film. (The Taliban soldiers are a bunch of yelling men in turbans and beards except of course for the sole bespectacled scholar fanatic whos the resident sadist.)The effect is to put us on our guard against manipulation the attractive stars doing award-baiting performances the mournful guitar score right on through to the ""cue the U2 redemptive song"" at the conclusion. In this case a softer touch would hit harder.

Less common are the ways American versions of foreign films underwhelm. Something specific to the place in which the work was conceived gets lost in translation. Take ""Brothers"" starring Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal as Marine Capt. Sam Cahill and his younger brother Tommy. Originally a Danish film by Susanne Bier (co-written by Anders Thomas Jensen) ""Brothers"" told the story of an honorable family man deeply damaged by his experience at the hands of fighters in Afghanistan. He returns home having been presumed dead. He finds that his black sheep of a brother and his wife have grown close. While there are bright and brave moments in director Jim Sheridans version ""Brothers"" often feels forced. The original was likened to a Greek tragedy. This reworking has enough tin-eared scenes to suggest a night of overheated theater. As the film begins Sam (Maguire) is days from returning to Afghanistan for a fourth tour of duty. Wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and their young daughters -- thoughtful Isabelle and easy charmer Maggie -- are by turns supportive and sulky. Brother Tommy (Gyllenhaal) is fresh from a stint of his own. Hes been in prison. More screw-up than criminal Tommy is the familys outcast. Their father a retired Marine played by Sam Shepard cant help verbally sparring with Tommy. A scene at the family dinner table depicts how in moments of father-son volatility women are often cast as endangered spectators. (Mare Winningham is wasted as the the siblings mother.) When Sam goes missing after his helicopter is downed Tommy rises to the occasion. He dotes on his nieces. He develops a quietly sparking intimacy with Grace. Sheridan and his cast let the light shine through in a number of scenes. Gyllenhaal is winning as his character sits at a bar teasing a none-too-pleased owner. Later a group of Tommys friends pitch in on a household project for Grace. Theres slapstick with the kids. But the look on the face of one of the men (Ethan Suplee) whispers eloquently of their discomfort with loss. Still too much rings false. When Tommy learns his brother is dead it makes for an uncomfortable moment but not because the news Grace delivers is hard to hear. The scene is clunky. Throughout Portman is charged with articulating deeper pains. But screenwriter David Benioff whos done truer work (""25th Hour"") has penned some wince-worthy dialogue. Too much of it is left to Portman. When Sam returns hes psychologically frayed. Maguire does sharper work inhabiting an altered Sam than he does with the before- trauma Marine. Theres little in his makeup prior to this devastating moment to make his actions convincing. No doubt that is the point. Torture and coercion twist a person. Yet ""Brothers"" never fully earns the right to exploit Sams crucible in Afghanistan and the angry anguish it brings about. Noises send Sam reaching for his gun. More menacing is that he cant shake the sense that somethings transpired between Tommy and Grace. Its a substitute obsession for the guilt gnawing at him. He demands that Grace and Tommy confess because he needs absolution. In 2002 Sheridan did incandescent work directing the two young actors who portrayed sisters in his autobiographical weepy ""In America"". With Bailee Madisons and Taylor Geares turns as daughters Isabelle and Maggie we now know that was no fluke. The kids are vibrant. They live in the moment getting -- and not -- what death means what departure means. Tommy and Graces happiness and confusion when Sam returns is nothing compared with the girls joy and anguish. The wee sisters provide the truest moments in ""Brothers."" ""BROTHERS."" Rfor language and some disturbing violent content. 1 hour 50 minutes. Directed by Jim Sheridan; written by David Benioff; based on the Danish movie by Susanne Bier and Anders Thomas Jensen; photography by Frederick Elmes; starring Tobey Maguire Jake Gyllenhaal Natalie Portman Sam Shepard Bailee Madison Taylor Geare and Mare Winningham.

Genre Drama WarDirector Jim SheridanCast Tobey Maguire Jake Gyllenhaal Natalie Portman (17) Post a Comment  Mariussaid on Tuesday August 14 2012 95632 PMWho the hell are these new generation of aotcrs? They all look like some dude in Twilight. I cant tell them apart anymore. Does this guy really think hes the next Brad Pitt or something that is agents have the audacity to demand more money? The age of the movie star is dead. Gone are the days when a household name brand star makes 25 million per film. Hollywood has raised a generation of forgettable mamas boys whose careers are just a fly-by-night flash-in-the-pan. Here today gone tomorrow. No staying power. There are no more strong leading aotcrs that can carry a blockbuster film let alone an iconic role anymore. Hollywood is in serious trouble right now. Where are the Steve McQueens the Clint Eastwoods the Harrison Fords the Kurt Russells the Schwarzeneggers the Stallones the Williss of today? They dont exist. Guys like Christian Bale who has worked consistently in the business all his life is in danger of extinction. Now you have guys like Sam Worthington who comes out of nowhere one day and instantly suffers from publicity overexposure. Hollywood is trying desperately to forge new stars. Maybe they should stop trying to ween the tween generation and go back to some good old fashioned moviemaking. Sarasaid on Saturday January 22 2011 14831 PMI just cant get over how this didnt get serious Oscar attention. This was one of the best movies of 2009 and Tobey Maguires shining moment as an actor. I seriously didnt know that Tobey had that kind of performance in him. He was astonishing. Christopher Zeidelsaid on Saturday January 02 2010 123015 AMI have now seen Brothers and I enjoyed it. The three lead performances are all very good especially Maguire. Maguire is not only convincing but he made us care about his character and the pain he suffered from. Sam Shepard is also good. Another good performance came from the little girl that hated her father; I dont know the actresss name but I very much felt for her. I know a lot of critics felt it was overly melodramatic but I disagree. It never went overboard with its drama and was convincing all the way though. Brian toomeysaid on Saturday December 26 2009 83837 PMYou were lost and now you are found Just watched my Blu-ray of ""District 9"" and read some reviews on Amazon.com. Someone remaked that the critics were not kind to this movie so I did some surfing and found Richard Roepers web-site. Yes Richard I have bookmarked your site and will view you weekly. The best Brian Eli boleysaid on Sunday December 13 2009 95958 PMAll right Richard so glad to see you doing Video reviews. I just saw this movie last night and Thought it was Outstanding If this film does not get any oscar nominations I will eat my face. lol. Neil Brownsaid on Thursday December 10 2009 54314 PMWhen it comes to music I never take a critics opinion. Especially with rockjazzhip hop. But when it comes to movies you and Ebert never let me down. You give a great insight into what we should expect and I often enjoy the movies your recommend. I may see Brothers tonight although luke warm reviews from others and the possibility that I seen too much of the preview. Im sure I will enjoy your latest suggestion. Cheers Neil Brown JhavaJoesaid on Tuesday December 08 2009 21700 AMI felt the same. I am very shocked the overall reviews didnt rate it that high (oh well). Toby Mcquire was exceptional. All the elements what make kids go mad are in Sam Shepards personality (his role). People have ranted for years about the need for relevence. With thousands if troops coming home (hopefully)  there is no more relevant a film as thisand to have done so without a hint of condescension. It was as if the ensemble cast knew it was a call to their highest efforts in their craft for a subjsct so important. That movie was simply a cut above. BTW good straight forward review. Tonysaid on Monday December 07 2009 33953 AMGlad to see youre doing video reviews again. All is finally right in the world ) Seriously keep it up Christopher Zeidelsaid on Sunday December 06 2009 21642 AMI have not seen Brothers but want to see it badly. It looks great. Natalie Portman has not made a good film since V for Vendetta and has not made a truly great film since Closer. It is about time. She is talented but unfortunately made too many mediocre and bad movies. I dont know what I will think about Brothers once I get a chance to see it but something tells me it will be worth it. Stevesaid on Sunday December 06 2009 122838 AMThanks so much for your review Richard; I thought you were spot on I absolutely loved the movie. It struck an emotional chord with me and I was deeply moved by it. It was also funny and entertaining and very sad and powerful. I was stationed in Iraq once when I was in the military so I felt that I could relate to some of the things the characters went through (though Im not saying that I experienced anything near as upsetting as what was shown in the movie). Accurate or non-accurate. Realistic or non-realistic aside; this was a powerful movie with awesome acting. I thought all the leads deserved Oscar-nods. Even this years fav Carey Mulligan gets a cameo (god what a great actress--she did An Education then this movie--I can tell shes gonna be big-time. Keep up the good work; you should have your own show on TV. Comments 1 - 10 of 17 1 2 | Next 7   Page 1 of 2 POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

ABOUT THE MOVIEBrothers   out of four Stars Jake Gyllenhaal Tobey Maguire Natalie Portman Sam Shepard Bailee Madison Mare WinninghamDirector Jim SheridanDistributor LionsgateRating R for language and some disturbing violent contentRunning time 1 hour 50 minutesOpens today in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Though no doubt coincidental the opening of Brothers the story of a troubled veteran of the war in Afghanistan seems appropriately timed in light of this weeks news of additional troop deployment. But its actually a remake of a 2004 Danish film directed here by Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot) and written by David Benioff (The Kite Runner). The eponymous brothers of the title appear to be polar opposites. Sam a Marine captain (Tobey Maguire) is an upstanding family man. Clearly the favorite son of his ex-Marine father Hank (Sam Shepard) Sam also is the cherished husband of Grace (Natalie Portman) and the father of two girls. His sons military service is a point of pride with the hard-nosed Hank. But it becomes a bone of contention for Grace when Sam is called to serve his fourth tour of duty. VIDEO See a clip of the movie INTERVIEW Natalie Portmans transition role Just before Sam ships off his hard-drinking black-sheep brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is released from prison. In the eyes of their unyielding father Tommy is an unforgiveable screw-up. But the siblings have an evident affection for each other. Not really the extremes they are painted to be both suffered through their fathers turbulent bouts though the family drama took them on divergent paths. The film focuses on that drama and on repressed emotions that explode when Sam returns home after being captured and tortured by the Taliban and presumed dead. While his model brother was gone Tommy had begun to overcome his neer-do-well reputation stepping in to help Grace and his nieces. Maguire reveals a coiled ferocity and a convincingly unhinged haunted quality. Its a little tougher to buy Gyllenhaals sweet-natured Tommy as an armed robber. His transformation into a responsible good guy happens swiftly. Still the two actors bear a resemblance and their chemistry is evident. Portman is subdued and reactive in a part that doesnt call for her to do much else. Sheridan is a consistently agile storyteller drawing strong performances from even the youngest actors. Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare are excellent as Sam and Graces young daughters derailed by their dads scary bouts of anger and his newfound coldness. The youthful portrayals recall the indelible roles of the young daughters in Sheridans wonderful 2003 film In America. Though there are several powerful and poignant scenes the film also features moments of unnecessary contrivance. An eruption during a family dinner treads familiar cinematic territory. Sams escalating rage leads predictably to its crescendoing conclusion. But in exploring the complicated nature of family bonds Brothers is thought-provoking. The wounds inflicted by the cruelty of a troubled parent can prove as painful as battle scars.

(Lionsgate) Joe Neumaier Thursday December 3 2009 629 PM Title Brothers ""Brothers"" tries to delve into how war can tear families apart but only succeeds in showing how miscasting and melodrama obscure good intentions. This is the kind of movie where every scoop of mashed potatoes or lap around a skating rink is staged to carry maximum meaning.Tobey Maguire plays Capt. Sam Cahill a high school football hero turned Marine whose snug Minnesota life includes his ex-cheerleader wife Grace (Natalie Portman) two adorable daughters and a tough Vietnam vet dad (Sam Shepard). The familys harmony is jarred when Sams black-sheep brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) gets out of prison after serving time for armed robbery.The siblings get along but everyone else is riled by Tommy. Then Sam is deployed to Afghanistan where his helicopter is shot down. Told her husband is dead Graces brief mourning is alleviated by Tommys growing help around the house. First he rebuilds the kitchen then he hangs with the kids then he and Grace are smoking pot and sharing a kiss.But it turns out Sam isnt dead; hes a Taliban prisoner being forced to commit atrocities. When freed after months of torture the edgy numb soldier who returns no longer connects to those who love him.Director Jim Sheridan (""In America"" ""My Left Foot"") remaking a 2004 Danish film fumbles both the Cahills cozy domesticity -- intended to be All-American it actually resembles a ""Bless This Home"" needlepoint come to life -- and the Middle East segment which has evildoers so caricatured theyre like James Bond villains. And theres a chunk missing from the middle when Tommy and Graces attraction should come to a boil. As it is it barely simmers.That may be because Portman especially is given no outlet for her strongest trait as an actress her knowing intelligence. We constantly hear Grace called ""beautiful"" (which she is) but ""Brothers"" doesnt ask her to be anything more. Shes also not quite the ""Minnesota ex-cheerleader and mother of two"" type. Maguire gets to do more once Sam returns with post-traumatic stress disorder -- for which we never see him treated -- but the wiry watchful actor is an ill fit from the start as a take-charge Marine. Gyllenhaal at least does some more solid brooding but Tommy is such a conceit that the film itself seems annoyed at both him and the contrivances around him. Skipping past any reflections about the dangers of coming home there are inarticulate fights and even a ""Someone once said ..."" voiceover. At least ""Brothers"" is always faithful to cliche.

Brothers Fine acting hampered by stilted rewrite | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBrothers Fine acting hampered by stilted rewriteRemakes so often suffer by comparison to their source movies its almost a form of punishment to look backwards.Tobey Maguire left and Jake Gyllenhaal play brothers in remake of a Danish drama that explores the aftermath of war when soldiers return home.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 4 2009 (out of four)Starring Tobey Maguire Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman. Directed by Jim Sheridan. 110 minutes. At major theatres. 14ARemakes so often suffer by comparison to their source movies its almost a form of punishment to look backwards.And for sure anyone contemplating whether to see Jim Sheridans domestic drama Brothers would be wise not to see its award-winning 2004 Danish predecessor beforehand. Susanne Biers original Brothers exceeds Sheridans copycat in every regard so much so that it could taint your view of the solid lead performances by Tobey Maguire Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman.Article Continued BelowThose who do venture a peek might join me in wondering why it is the Irish filmmaker opted to make an almost scene-by-scene recreation of Biers Brothers yet weirdly edited out (or never filmed) the moments where the story is properly advanced and emotions are amplified. Its almost as if Sheridan and screenwriter David Benioff (The Kite Runner) were constructing a pile of old bones for a museum installation with no live connective tissue required.Its a real shame because Sheridans Brothers is just good enough to make you see how it might have been great. Set in the fall of 2007 in the American heartland and also on the Afghanistan war plain it examines the complications of decisions made both in the bedroom and on the battlefield and also the justifications people use to explain their actions. The story turns on two brothers in motion. Dedicated soldier Capt. Sam Cahill (Maguire) is returning to Afghanistan for his fourth tour of duty with the Marines while his neer-do-well sibling Tommy (Gyllenhaal) is being released from prison having served time for some kind of bank job.Sam and Tommy arent much alike and they disagree over just about everything. But they love each other and get along pretty well - at least until their hard-nut father (Sam Shepard) begins needling Tommy at the family dinner table for failing to follow Sams sterling example.Dormant tensions rise among them the mixed feelings by Sams wife Grace (Portman) towards Tommy. Among other things she thinks hes not much of an uncle to the two daughters she has with Sam Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare).Something happens in Afghanistan shortly after Sams arrival that dramatically changes the family situation both at home and abroad. Anyone who has seen the trailer knows what it is and also the turbulent outcome when misapprehensions assumptions and opportunities change family dynamics. The movie contains a surprising amount of suspense even knowing the plot basics in advance.The performances by Maguire Gyllenhaal and Portman are all high-calibre yet lack the natural feel of the work by their Danish counterparts. In the original Brothers you could better understand the motivations of the characters and the decisions they make. The story of Brothers should be fertile ground for Sheridan who has made a career-long study of complex family connections from In the Name of the Father to The Boxer to the more recent In America. Yet he seems to be going through the motions tracking Biers original and sanitizing it for an American audience afraid of subtitles. Even the obligatory inclusion of a U2 song feels rote. Its still a film worth seeing if only for the performances but it seems to be something far short of a labour of love by Sheridan.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Brothers Drama. Starring Natalie Portman Jake Gyllenhaal and Tobey Maguire. Directed by Jim Sheridan. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) A man goes to war and comes back a spectral presence in his home thin scarred and haunted an empty shell who left everything in Afghanistan except his anger. The power of war to transform people the subject of Jim Sheridans ""Brothers"" is brought home in the performance of Tobey Maguire a normally boyish actor who leaves no doubt that this Marine has seen and done things that are possessing his entire being. ""Brothers"" touches on the effects of war and also on the culture of a specific type of family. The father played by Sam Shepard is a former soldier a very hard limited man and a nasty drunk. His sons grew up to play the roles this mean stupid man assigned to them Sam (Maguire) as the family hero and Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) as the black sheep. The film suggests that only when Sam is no longer a daily presence in Tommys life - as the opposite number that gives him definition as the bad son - can the younger brother come into his own as a man. Directed by Sheridan written by David Benioff (""25th Hour"") and based on a Danish film by Susanne Bier (""After the Wedding"") ""Brothers"" has the careful observation measured pace and lived-in feeling of a good European film. Gyllenhaal and Maguire have the flashy roles in ""Brothers"" and they dont shrink from them. But it may very well be Natalie Portman as a military wife and the mother of Sams two daughters that youll find yourself thinking about the next day.

(AP Photo/Lionsgate Lorey Sebastian) Photo Lorey Sebastian AP Review Power of war transforms angry family 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In a role without any flamboyant touches playing what is essentially just a decent intelligent woman Portman lends the film dignity understanding and true radiance. Portman has gotten so beautiful in the past few years that Benioff has to fit it into the script - he has to account for her appearance by having others comment on it in the same way youd have to account for a character with two heads. But this is about more than being really pretty and has to do with something specific to movies a willingness to feel and be seen by the camera. -- Advisory This film contains strong language and scenes of disturbing violence.

Its a good thing that Hollywood hasnt seemed to notice (or care) because this year included some terrific offerings in the genre. All three movies--The Hurt Locker The Messenger Brothers--demonstrate that war is hell but they also show us that the most difficult fights arent always on the battlefield. Theyre often right in the kitchen after the war when the soldiers come face to face with loved ones who cant comprehend what combat does to a persons soul. When the main character in The Hurt Locker a bomb-detonation expert is asked by his wife to buy cereal or chop carrots its clear that he cant cope with the banality of his old life. (Article continued below...) Brothers is the most recent of the three films and perhaps the most mainstream. Based on a 2004 Danish movie by Susanne Bier and directed by Jim Sheridan (My Left Foot) it stars Tobey Maguire as a Marine named Sam who leaves home for Afghanistan just as his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) returns home from jail. Sams wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and their kids (the excellent Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare) find themselves torn between the two men hating the father who comes back completely changed loving the ex-con who stayed with them. The films most powerful scene is actually set at a childs birthday party where one of the girls wont stop rubbing a balloon to make a screeching sound. To most parents its an everyday annoyance. To Sam the noise sounds like gunfire and serves as a reminder of how he can no longer relate to his familys happiness. Its a metaphor for his fragile psyche.Portman has some of the most difficult scenes and this is her most accomplished work since Closer. But Brothers is Maguires movie. So gaunt that he almost looks like a ghost he bites into his character like a rabid dog. Brothers shows us that even when our troops do come home their war may be far from over.

Starring Natalie Portman Tobey Maguire Jake Gyllenhaal Carey Mulligan Sam Shepard Mare Winningham Director Jim Sheridan Running time 150 Release Opened Dec 4 2009  Editorial Review Walking through the minefields of war and familyBy Michael OSullivanWashington Post Staff WriterFriday December 4 2009 With a running time of slightly less than two hours ""Brothers"" isnt an especially lengthy film. But it does take half the movie before the story -- about the relationship between a straight-arrow Marine serving in Afghanistan and his neer-do-well ex-con brother back home -- really kicks in. When it does itll knock the air out of you.The first part is all meticulous setup but not a minute is ill spent.In 2007 Capt. Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) leaves behind his beautiful wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and two adorable daughters (heartbreakers Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare) to fight the Taliban. Early in the film Sams helicopter is shot down in the mountains and hes presumed dead leaving Grace and the girls to seek solace with Sams younger brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) an ice-blue-eyed charmer whos fresh out of prison for bank robbery but who redeems himself with his sister-in-law -- who never liked him -- by slowly discovering a responsible side.Meanwhile back in Afghanistan Sam isnt actually dead just being tortured in a remote Taliban outpost. When hes finally rescued and returns home months later a gaunt catatonic version of his former self its to a family he no longer recognizes and that no longer recognizes him.This is where the real movie begins. Or rather it begins just before Sams return when something bad -- something real bad -- happens to Sam in Afghanistan. Something that turns him into the kind of monster that only war can create and might leave you wondering if he wouldnt be better off dead. Sam certainly wonders that.""Brothers"" is the story of that monster and his struggle to find his humanity.Is it a movie youll enjoy? Not enjoy so much as appreciate. Or maybe recognize. Adapted by writer David Benioff and director Jim Sheridan from a 2004 Danish film of the same name ""Brothers"" is depressing as hell. And like most war movies these days it ends on a note thats far from hopeful. But its good and wise and it feels true. Meaning it hurts.In the roles of Sam and Tommy Maguire and Gyllenhaal have their work cut out for them. In a sense their characters have to trade places Sam moving from golden boy to paranoid antisocial beast who carries a gun in the kitchen and who accuses his brother of having an affair with Grace; and Tommy moving from shiftless drunken lout to husband material. If I were casting the movie Id have picked actors with slightly less natural sweetness which undermines each characters dark side. Still both manage to carry off difficult transitions -- trajectories that start from opposite poles but intersect somewhere in the middle -- with wrenching believability.The title ""Brothers"" suggests that the movie is purely a family drama one thats exclusively concerned with the reconciliation between estranged differently damaged sons. Sam Shepard by the way turns in a fine performance as Sam and Tommys emotionally distant Vietnam-veteran father. And Mare Winningham is equally good as his stolid second wife. But ""brothers"" has another meaning calling to mind not just the plight of siblings but of brothers-in-arms.Thats the subtext of ""Brothers"" which uses the fallout from Sams actions in Afghanistan to explore how he -- and by extension we -- have injured ourselves through fighting wars.Though the term post-traumatic stress disorder is never mentioned the film is one harrowing case study in PTSD with a long lingering emphasis on the P. As Sam notes in voice-over at the films bleak and wrenching conclusion ""only the dead have seen the end of war.""At area theaters. Contains obscenity drug use and scenes of violence and torture.

Having seen the trailer for ""Brothers"" and now the finished film I feel as though I just watched the trailer twice. A thin script written by David Benioff and directed by Jim Sheridan (who based his film on a Danish one) is merely a promising first draft a vague drama that is sort of a soapy love triangle (""I thought you were dead"" etc.) and sort of an inquiry into the post-battle trauma afflicting a Marine captain burdened by a gruesome secret about his captivity in Afghanistan. The captain Sam Cahill is played by Tobey Maguire who through no fault of his own is simply not the man to play any military leader above the rank of Eagle Scout. While Sam is away and mistakenly reported killed in action (I feel bad about giving that away but its in the trailer) back home his bad-boy brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) cuddles up with Sams wife Grace (Natalie Portman). PHOTOS ""BROTHERS"" SCREENING IN NYC PHOTOS DECEMBERS BEST OSCAR BETS Harrumphing on the perimeter is Sam Shepard as the hard-drinking patriotic-old-bastard dad himself a former Marine and Vietnam vet. The movie is reasonably compelling and decently acted but at no point is it convincing. It skips past essential plot points (why would the military report the Marine dead instead of MIA if his body was never found?) as well as deeper emotional quandaries. It doesnt bother to settle the question of whether Grace and Tommy are in love or merely kissed in a moment of tipsy loneliness nor does it offer a good reason why Grace would take such a momentous step with Tommy whom she has disliked for years because hes a lout. We are supposed to believe romance could blossom because he renovates her kitchen and they both like U2? Meanwhile in Afghanistan Sam participates in an episode of brutality totally out of character for such an honorable man. Why he does it is left unexplained. ""Brothers"" isnt nearly as unbearable as most of the anti-war pictures of the last five years but when it comes to members of the armed services screenwriters continue to lose their ability to think in more than one dimension. The Shepard figure for instance is an off-the-shelf product untouched by research or insight; Sheridan and Benioff give him a whisky bottle and a snarl and a couple of my-country-right-or-wrong lines and think theyre finished. Even the civilian Tommy because he is constructed to stand for the opposite of the cliche of Sams hero-jock (again Maguire is not the guy to hire when you think ""star football player"") is simply a mirror image of a cliche -- a creature of prisons and road houses. Underneath the neck tats hes a misunderstood nice guy who just needed to escape his brothers shadow. Benioff came of age after Vietnam after the era when the average man was likely to have served or at least known many others who had and his lack of feel is fatal. When constructing military dramas writers would do better to first develop characters and then add uniforms rather than the reverse.

Irish director Jim Sheridan who has worked in the United States in recent decades works in intimate detail concentrating on personalities rather than battleground action. Structured in parallel sections contrasting war and home it follows siblings who exchange roles a hero who returns from the front erratic and violent and an ex-con who learns self-control when hes handed responsibility. Tobey Maguire plays Capt. Sam Cahill a Marine about to begin his fourth tour in Afghanistan. His wife Grace (Natalie Portman) puts up a brave front about his absence while their daughters Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare) can scarcely hide their disappointment. Days before he embarks Sam collects younger brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) from prison where he has served three years for bank robbery. The men share a love-hate relationship. Tommy is hot-tempered and frequently drunk to the unconcealed disgust of their father (Sam Shepard) a Marine Vietnam veteran. A homecoming dinner one of several uneasy family meals featured throughout turns into a battlefield between the disapproving father and prodigal son. While on deployment Sam is presumed dead. With the hero of the family absent Tommy pulls himself together. He begins spending time with Grace and the girls taking them on ice skating trips and remodeling their long-neglected house. The four begin to form an emotional connection unaware that Sam survived his helicopter crash. Starved and tortured by his Taliban captors he returns home physically and emotionally scarred hiding secrets that will return to haunt him. Projecting his self-reproach on Tommy he jealously accuses the black sheep of cheating with Grace and explodes in violent rages. Tommy becomes the familys protector. Adapted from a first-class 2004 Danish drama of the same title this remake never achieves the naturalistic impact of the original. ""Brothers"" cops out with a corny blubbery Hollywood ending instead of something gutsy. Still its worthy on its own terms. Sheridan is generally a splendid actors director following even sideline performances with attentive closeups. Maguires full-out emotional range here is a career pinnacle. From his early scenes as a blissful family man through his horror and confusion in captivity to his combustible moods back home hes riveting. Shepards ramrod old soldier is as abrasive as 40-grit sandpaper; he deserves more time onscreen. The young actresses playing Isabelle and Maggie are captivating and heart-rending while Carey Mulligan (""An Education"") makes a nuanced impression in a brief turn as a war widow. Even the three roustabouts who help Tommy renovate Graces kitchen are vivid. The cast isnt uniformly strong however. Gyllenhaal lacks menace as Tommy. Hes more a scalawag than a renegade and theres no yearning sexual heat in his almost-romance with Grace. Portman dimples prettily and cries on cue but she could be coated in Teflon; her performance doesnt stick with you. BROTHERS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for language and some disturbing violent content. The film packs a wallop. Too bad about the missteps. It couldve been a knockout.

""Brothers"" is a remake of a Danish film.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted December 04 2009In a recent interview David Benioff the screenwriter of Brothers talked about the strange sensation of adapting Susanne Biers pitch-perfect Danish film of the same name to English describing the process as a form of ""sanctioned plagiarism.""And indeed there are scenes in the Jim Sheridan-directed remake that are identical to the riveting 2004 drama about a soldier who goes to war and the wife and black-sheep brother he leaves behind. Connie Nielsen a native Dane starred in the original with the very fine actors Ulrich Thomsen and Nikolaj Lie Kaas. Natalie Portman plays the wife and mother in Sheridan and Benioffs version Tobey Maguire the deployed Marine Jake Gyllenhaal his ex-con sibling.And all three - Portman Maguire Gyllenhaal - turn in the best work of their careers.Maguire is Sam Cahill a Marine captain called up for a return trip to Afghanistan with his men. He leaves behind two young daughters and Grace (Portman) his high school sweetheart. (She has ""Sam"" tattooed on her shoulder.) The Cahill girls are accustomed to his absences but no less anxious each new time he decamps. The officers in dress uniform who come knocking on neighbors doors in this Minnesota military town are an all too familiar - and dreaded - sight.And this time the bearers of bad news arrive at the Cahills front steps. Sam was in a helicopter that crashed in rugged terrain in Taliban country. He is presumed dead.While the audience discovers that Sam has survived and is being held prisoner for the Cahills the process of mourning - the ache the grief - begins to bore a hole into the familys collective soul. Sams father a Vietnam vet who long ago turned to booze is broken by the loss of his ""good"" son. Sam Shepard is this bitter taciturn man and its a fine portrayal. And young Bailee Madison as Sam and Graces firstborn Isabelle gives one of those frighteningly empathetic performances that little kids in the company of practiced actors sometimes somehow come up with. Her hurt is palpable.As for Tommy Cahill (Gyllenhaal) a hard-drinking screw-up straight out of a Raymond Carver story he finds a new sense of responsibility and purpose in his brothers absence. ""Uncle Tommy"" becomes a sort of surrogate father figure. He gets close with Grace - in ways neither of them is entirely comfortable with. And he brings in a crew to renovate Graces ramshackle kitchen. Driven by grief guilt and his own needs - not by calculation - Tommy insinuates himself into Graces and Isabelles and little Maggies life.Which creates a problem when Sam finally is rescued and returns home. Brothers is a movie about post-traumatic stress disorder about how war forces people to do unspeakable things irrevocably changing them. Maguire gaunt and hollow-eyed is chilling as the soldier come home bearing an ugly secret and the scars of months in captivity.If Sheridans Brothers has a failing in comparison to Biers it is in the section with Sam and a Marine private (Patrick Flueger) as fellow prisoners in the mountains of Afghanistan. The privates failure to hold steady becomes an irritant to Sam as the two of them are kept for week upon week in a dark hole tortured and afraid. In Biers version you feel Sams resentment for this weaker man deep down. It is that contempt that psychologically frayed loathing - fueled by their abuse at the hands of the guerrilla fighters - that helps to explain the horrific events Sam is forced to be party to. Sheridans version doesnt quite get to that same point which makes Sams actions seem less convincing.But this is a small bone to pick and perhaps viewers unfamiliar with Biers film wont even know.Irish director Sheridan (In the Name of the Father In America) is a master of concise storytelling able to describe family dynamics in keen detail (look at the way Gyllenhaals Tommy eats his peas at a family dinner - his gestures speak volumes) getting to bigger issues through the small. Brothers is a heartbreaking film that speaks to the lifelong aftershocks of war and to the powerful bonds of family and of love.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

""Brothers"" Movie Review -- There has been a long line of movies about our wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ""In the Valley of Elah"" ""The Hurt Locker"" ""The Messenger"" ""Grace is Gone."" Most focused on the home front. Some drew critical raves. None found a large audience. They all however felt as if they were about this time and about these wars. Brothers (R) Lionsgate (110 min.) Directed by Jim Sheridan. With Jake Gyllenhaal Natalie Portman Tobey Maguire. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO STARS Ratings note The film contains strong language violence and substance abuse. Not ""Brothers."" Although the copyright at the end reads ""2009"" this is a film that feels like an artifact from the 70s. Halfway through I kept expecting Jake Gyllenhaal to sport tie-dye or Tobey Maguire to morph into Bruce Dern. Its all a rehash of some old argument "" as if veteran director Jim Sheridan were wrestling with Vietnam all over again. The story casts Gyllenhaal and Maguire as brothers Cain and Abel; Gyllenhaals Tommy Cahill is the ex-con no-account screw-up and Maguires Sam is the straight-arrow Marine captain and family man. Then Sam goes back to Afghanistan and is reported killed in a helicopter crash. And Tommy starts giving aid and comfort "" perhaps a little too much aid and comfort "" to Sams grieving wife Grace (Natalie Portman). Since the trailers have already given away what happens next I guess its fair to reveal that it turns out Sam has only been captured not killed and that when he returns home hes not the same man. In fact hes not a man at all. Hes a character in some barely believable movie. I dont buy that the Marine Corps would so quickly inform a woman that she was a widow when it hadnt recovered a body "" or that a devoted spouse would so simply quickly accept that. (The film doesnt seem to buy it either; Sheridan rushes through these scenes.) Nor do I buy that while this Marine was in captivity "" well I wont give that twist away. But what Sam does seems completely out of character for him as a man and as a Marine. Its a false and ugly moment and the movie never recovers from it. The movie would have been better actually if Sam had died in that helicopter crash. Then perhaps we could have focused more on his wife lightly played by Natalie Portman and her relationship with her sexy black-sheep brother-in-law. And maybe the movie could have delved a little deeper into her guilt and anger and mourning and spent a little more time with her in-laws embodied by Sam Shepard (wonderful in an underwritten part) and Mare Winningham (lovely but a decade too young for the role). Instead it has Sam survive dishonorably and return home wreathed in lies. And before you can say ""Coming Home"" its time for him to start popping his eyes and wandering around the backyard looking for insurgents and carrying his gun around. Some of this works "" Sheridan is a director whos always had a feel for the push-and-pull of relationships and the demands of family. But this is a dubious drama "" it feels like a belated response to ""The Deer Hunter"" "" and worse only exploits some real issues like post-traumatic stress that its trying to illuminate. Many movies have looked at our armed forces and the current conflicts; many have questioned our diplomatic policies or military strategies. And perhaps its true that as some analysts say generals are always re-fighting the last war. But when did directors start doing it too?

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + It would be nice to report that ""Brothers is a film about how Shaq and Kobe made up by hugging out old beefs. It is instead the story of Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) and the terrible misunderstanding that almost ruins their family. The movie is in trouble long before they are. This is a corny tale told with both generous helpings of deli-sliced cheese and a brief stretch of chilling tumultuousness.Sam is a Marine captain bound for another deployment in Afghanistan. Not long before he leaves he picks up Tommy on his first day out of prison. Sam is stern and serious a professional soldier. He has a high tight haircut he loves his wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and two small daughters (Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare) and might love serving his country even more. His father Hank (Sam Shepard) was also a Marine. Tommy is the family flop. He drinks like his father but serves only himself.With Sam overseas the movie breaks in half then falls apart. Sams helicopter is shot down and he is presumed dead. The family holds a funeral and his wife and girls begin to move on with a sober and sobered Tommy subbing unconvincingly as a husbandly and fatherly surrogate. He gets some buddies to renovate his brothers kitchen and provides Grace and the girls with a man around the house. Only barely is there a sexual spark. But thats plenty to drive the mania of the movies second half.As it happens Sam is very much alive a hostage of aggrieved camcorder-wielding Afghan fighters. While he and a private (Patrick Flueger) are subjected to mind-bending terror in Afghanistan were being tortured here at home. Every time the film cuts from the devastated look on Maguires face to a scene of Gyllenhaal frolicking with the two girls or getting high with Portman its like being splashed with frigid water.""Brothers is a remake of a 2004 Danish drama directed and co-written by Susanne Bier and also about a soldier in Afghanistan and his neer-do-well brother. The movie was remarkable for its restraint style and seamless construction. It was narrative physics. The two brothers seemed tragically incapable of harmony. Ones ability to see the bright side forced the other into darkness.This American version written by David Benioff and directed by the Irishman Jim Sheridan captures little of the original films psychological shading. Sam and Tommy arent on that crucial cosmic tether. What befalls them gets telegraphed to us. In the opening minutes Sam gives an envelope addressed for Grace to a fellow Marine and says ""Hope you dont have to deliver it. Indeed his letter stays buried in a drawer for full melodramatic effect.With their giant eyes and lipless mouths Gyllenhaal and Maguire could indeed be brothers. And a hollowed out and haunted Maguire plays his one disturbed note to perfection. Hes too good in fact since when he explodes he singes the rest of the movie.The three Danish stars were older than their American counterparts and that difference turns out to be crucial. These lives are lived by real young people all over the country but this cast seems too young to believably bear the stress. Plus Maguire Gyllenhaal and Portman have become high-note actors. The lower emotional registers dont seem to interest them. Theyre not going for complete characters here. Theyre going for scenes.Sheridan is a one-note filmmaker too. The torture passages here are of a piece with the political violence in his IRA films ""In the Name of the Father and ""The Boxer. Such scenes are so effective that they make the other side of the movie unbearable. Thomas Newmans jaunty score sounds like an entry in a James Taylor sound-alike contest and it never stops. When it does there are songs by Sheridans buddies U2.Sheridans single note extends to the way he directs children He can be violently cute. (His popular aggravation ""In America also featured two little girls.) That urge to film extreme cruelty and extreme innocence explains the films one good scene set at a dinner table with the entire Cahill clan and a lady friend of Tommys. Sheridan manages an impossible balance of lightness and tension that culminates in Sams older daughter squeezing a balloon until it pops. Madison contorts the girls sweet nature until she eerily resembles her father. The scene is overdone but it works.By that point ""Brothers has become just a juicy entertainment See Sam go crazy. This is another movie about a fractured soldier and the posttraumatic stress of war. Yet theres something distasteful in the way Sheridan relishes turning that trauma into a potboiler.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Fun fact Five years separate Susanne Biers Danish film Brodre and the English-language remake yet the defining trauma of both melodramas remains the war in Afghanistan. (And should the Danish want to remake the remake again in a few years the script likely wont need a rewrite.) Scripted by 25th Hour writer David Benioff and helmed by In The Name Of The Father director Jim Sheridan the new Brothers more or less transcribes Bier and Anders Thomas Jensens love triangle between a military professional his wife and his screw-up brother--a dynamic that shifts radically before during and after the former leaves for his latest tour of duty and is declared dead after a helicopter crash. Its a combustible (though boilerplate) situation that Bier once Dogme 95-certified plays to the hilt. For his part Sheridan treats it with a turgidness that shouldnt be mistaken for restraint. In the early going Tobey Maguire and Natalie Portman are an iconic American military family high-school sweethearts--he was the quarterback she a cheerleader--who live in a nice little house with two adorable young girls. Few men could hope to measure up to that standard but Maguires brother (Jake Gyllenhaal) an ex-con and frequent drunk falls considerably short of the mark--a fact that their Vietnam-vet father (Sam Shepard) no angel himself never fails to point out. When Maguire is shot down in Afghanistan Gyllenhaal pulls himself together enough to take care of his brothers family without fully usurping his role as father and husband. No matter Maguire returns unexpectedly having suffered tremendously and the sight of his wife and brother together ignites his paranoia frustration and anger. With all these elements in place--brother against brother intimations of adultery and post-traumatic stress disorder at the top not to mention alcoholism crushing guilt a cruel father and assorted other crises--Brothers seems like a powder keg ready to go off. And though someone clearly lit the fuse on the normally mild-mannered Maguire the film takes a leisurely hour to get to its dramatic core with scenes from Afghanistan on loan from The Deer Hunter. Still the intrinsically powerful material occasionally pierces through with Gyllenhaal especially strong as a reformed yahoo who suddenly takes on more responsibility than he seems capable of handling. Brothers supplies him and the other actors with a slew of big dramatic moments but the emotions ring louder than any truths.

Comments (4) click to enlarge Brothers 2009 Brothers (2004) a lesser feature by the fine Danish director Susanne Bier gets an American remake with a bevy of handsome stars whose unlikely glamour only exacerbates the original storys contrivances. An upright soldier (Tobey Maguire) ships off for Afghanistan and goes down in a helicopter crash leaving his jailbird brother (Jake Gyllenhaal) to move in on the soldiers devoted wife (Natalie Portman) and adorable children. The family goes through with a funeral service even though no body has been recovered and guess what? The soldier is still alive held captive by the Taliban in scenes too woodenly staged and shot to feel credible. Biers film succeeded on the merits of its actors and this one offers fine performances by Portman and Gyllenhaal but Maguire doesnt cut the mustard as the anguished military man. Jim Sheridan (In America) directed; with Sam Shepard Bailee Madison Mare Winningham and Carey Mulligan. R 110 min. By J.R.

Sam Cahill a Marine who is left shattered after being taken captive in Afghanistan and Jake Gyllenhaal plays his ex-convict sibling Tommy in ""Brothers."" By Jake Coyle updated 12/1/2009 73323 PM ET 2009-12-02T003323 Print Font + - Review In Jim Sheridans ""Brothers"" it feels like the films three young stars are playing house. Tobey Maguire Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhaal have all previously played memorable teenage characters and each has maintained a youthfulness into their late 20s and 30s. Here they star in a suburban domestic drama that extends all the way to Afghanistan. Maguire is Captain Sam Cahill a decorated Marine and husband to his high school sweetheart Grace (Portman) with whom he has two daughters. Gyllenhaal is Sams brother Tommy (Gyllenhaal) the black sheep of the family who at the movies start is just getting out of prison. When Sam ships out to Afghanistan hes presumed dead after a fiery helicopter crash. Grace is heartbroken from the loss but finds support in a maturing Tommy. He helps around the house plays with the kids and begins to have feelings for Grace. All the while we know Sam is not dead and has been taken prisoner. Under threat of death hes forced to commit an unspeakable sin an incident that damages and haunts him when he returns to his previously idyllic family life. The possibility that his brother and his wife have become romantically involved causes him to explode in jealousy. ""Brothers"" is a remake of Susanne Biers 2004 Danish film ""Brodre"" in which the three main characters were slightly older. But the youth of ""Brothers"" isnt a knock on the film. On the contrary it makes it more realistic given the thousands of fresh-faced soldiers so often sent to war. Advertise Advertise Advertise Its one of the few differences between Sheridans remake and the original. Its a simple story and ""Brodre"" had an affecting lyrical quality a poetry lacking in Sheridans sleeker more sentimental film. Staying almost scene-for-scene with the original Sheridan (""My Left Foot"" ""In America"") weaves the dual story lines -- at home and in Afghanistan -- building the tension for the inevitable clash between the separate worlds. ""Brothers"" has aspirations for ""Deer Hunter"" territory -- a dramatic examination of the cost blue-collar families pay for war. Where ""Deer Hunter"" was epic in its reach ""Brothers"" feels as though it never really leaves the front yard. Video Brothers Hes dead scene When Sam returns home he might as well be an alien. Hes creepy and bug-eyed with post-traumatic mania nearly unrecognizable to his family.

Every on-screen drink in Mad Men in 5 minutes See the Dancing stars most memorable moves Emmys biggest snubs? Cranston Hamm more Toy Story toys burn up in prank on mom Gyllenhaal is perhaps too likable for his character. We believe his caring responsible uncle but not his recent history as a drunk convict. By distilling the story of war down to a single family ""Brothers"" makes an impossibly complex story of war understandable and human. But missed are opportunities to expand the film such as with Sam and Tommys father an alcoholic veteran played by Sam Shepherd. Portman is mostly left to bounce between Sam and Tommy. Constantly either longing for her husband or anxious for his well-being she rings true as a military mother full of worry and caring. In the end ""Brothers"" hopes that healing can happen through confession and understanding. Ultimately its the need for the home front to know the pain of its sons and daughters fighting abroad. Its a worthy lesson and the aspiration of ""Brothers"" is noble. But it cant preserve the intimacy of the original film and the loosened characters slide into cliche.

In this case though theres no saintly paraplegic and the more the love-triangle drama tries for power the more it strains. Tobey Maguire newly buff and buzz-cut severe is Sam Cahill who returns to Afghanistan for a fourth tour -- and is presumed dead when the chopper hes in gets shot down. In fact he has been made a prisoner of the Taliban who have devised unique ways to break down his defenses (I wont reveal their methods). Natalie Portman is Sams devoted wife Grace and Jake Gyllenhaal is his disaffected ex-con brother who starts hanging around Grace and her kids to comfort them. His loving impulses ultimately cross a line of propriety though not nearly as greatly as Sam imagines after he returns home an unlikely survivor who now has the outlook (and pallor) of the walking dead. Brothers isnt badly acted but as directed by the increasingly impersonal Jim Sheridan (In America) its lumbering and heavy-handed a film that piles on overwrought dramatic twists until it begins to creak under the weight of its presumed significance.

Marine captain and stalwart head-of-household Sam (Tobey Maguire) married to his high school sweetheart Grace (Natalie Portman) and proud pop of two adorable daughters returns to Afghanistan for a fourth tour of duty just a few days after Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) his no-good kid brother leaves the pokey. Thought dead after his helicopter crashes Sam survives and is held captive by the Taliban (torture by radical Sunni Muslims has become a specialty of screenwriter David Benioff who wrote the adaptation of 2007s The Kite Runner). Tommy mans up ice-skates with his nieces renovates his sister-in-laws kitchen and gives her a smooch. Sam returns home looking and acting more and more like Travis Bickle. Sheridan repeatedly drawn to family sagas including his own (2002s In America) aims for Greek tragedy but ends up with a PTSD melodrama with Maguire able to produce slobber almost as effortlessly as Portman can summon up tears--essentially all her role calls for.

Brothers Good to great Director Jim Sheridan. Cast Tobey Maguire Jake Gyllenhaal Natalie Portman. Rating Rated R for language and some disturbing violent content. RELATED Brothers in movies Movies about Iraq and the Middle East Director Jim Sheridans take on the film (a remake of Susanne Biers original) sifts through the effects of war on one family - a family that didnt need any outside influence to add to its problems. Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is a Marine Corps captain about to ship out to Afghanistan - again. His wife Grace (Natalie Portman) and girls (Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare ) are used to the drill though that doesnt mean theyre happy about it. Before he goes Sam has to run an errand Pick up his brother Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) just released from prison. The lines are drawn that starkly. Sam is a hero his father a former Marine (Sam Shepard) reminds Tommy more than once. And what is Tommy exactly? The town screw-up pretty much one of those guys who hang around and never amount to much. Then the unthinkable Bereavement officers show up at Graces door. Sam has been killed in an attack on his helicopter. We know differently. Sheridan moves back and forth between Afghanistan and the Cahills home; Sam actually has been captured and is being held prisoner with a fellow Marine (Patrick Flueger). Their situation is dire at best but at least theyre still alive for now. Grace doesnt know this of course. Shes learning to live as a single mother. Help comes from a most unlikely place Tommy. Whatever his life has been missing (including a decent relationship with his father) Grace and her daughters seem to provide. He and Grace grow close and the girls love having him around. In Afghanistan meanwhile Sam is forced to make a horrible torturous choice. And then miraculously hes freed. Grace and the girls are elated of course. So is Tommy. So is everyone. But somethings wrong. Sam isnt the same. We know hes haunted by guilt. It eats at him constantly. And he is wracked by jealousy convinced that Tommy and Grace had an affair. To see Sam disintegrate is unnerving. To see his girls watch it happen is heartbreaking. They dont understand whats happened of course - no one does. Sam wont say and its killing him. They only know its a lot happier when Uncle Tommy is around. Portman is excellent as a woman quietly navigating a wrenching set of circumstances. Grace loves Sam but she doesnt know how to help him. Gyllenhaal also is outstanding as a man adrift finally finding mooring only to have the situation change in the time it takes for Grace to answer the phone. Maguire too is good in a tricky role. At times he flirts with going too far with Sams falling apart too over the top. Thats what I thought at first anyway. Yet who are we to say? How can anyone who has not gone through the torture had to make the unthinkable choices that Sam has made to get back to his family know how they would respond? We cant and its presumptuous to think otherwise. Mention also must be made of Madison and Geare who play the girls. Theyre fantastic; their comfort with their characters their unaffected portrayal makes what theyre going through all the more devastating. ""Brothers"" gets at that devastation most effectively the debilitating effect war can have on a family when one of its members is killed - and even when theyre not. Or on this case both.

"Brothers | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; brothers ) Brothers (United States 2009) December 01 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Brothers is arguably the most successful remake of a foreign film since Martin Scorsese reworked Infernal Affairs into The Departed and won the Oscar. By remaining rigorously faithful to Susanne Biers 2004 Danish feature Brodre screenwriter David Benioff and director Jim Sheridan manage to retain the themes and psychological nuances of the original while opening it up to a wider English-speaking audience. Subtle differences in the way the actors interpret the characters and small omissions additions and changes allow Brothers to stand on its own. This is a powerful disturbing film that explores common cinematic territory - the ability of war to destroy the individual - without seeming clichA(c)d or familiar. The movie opens by introducing us to the title characters. Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire) is the older brother. A responsible upright man he married his high school sweetheart Grace (Natalie Portman) and has two bright happy children Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare). He is a captain in the Marines and is about to return to Afghanistan for another tour of duty - a place that feels to him ""almost like home."" Meanwhile Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) has just been released from prison where he spent time for a bank robbery. Hes the black sheep of the family - perpetually drunk and drifting without a rudder. His father Hank (Sam Shepard) views Tommy with thinly-veiled contempt wishing he could be more like his brother. Tragedy strikes shortly after Sams return to duty. He is involved in a helicopter crash and is presumed dead. The news stuns Grace and Tommy and has the unintended consequence of bringing them closer together. Driven by the need to become a better person he ""substitutes"" for Sam becoming a father-figure to the girls and a confidante for Grace. Sexual tension develops between Grace and Tommy but it is unclear to either whether its the result of genuine romantic feelings or shared grief. The older brother however is not dead. He and one of his men Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger) are captured by the Taliban held in confinement for months and tortured. When Sam is finally rescued he is a changed man. Grace is overjoyed at the news of his imminent return but she does not realize the man she loved and married effectively died in Afghanistan. Brothers has no political axe to grind and unlike many films that have used the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as a backdrop it has no agenda to pursue beyond the basic one of depicting the dehumanizing consequences of conflict (any conflict not just todays). The film is antiwar in a general sense not because it disagrees with the underlying reasons for the war but because it sees a human toll that often goes unreported and unnoticed. News reports would see Sams story as miraculous - a brave hero originally thought dead being recovered and returned to the bosom of his loving wife and daughters. The reality is grim. Sams psyche has been shredded; nowhere is this more profoundly obvious than when he finds himself unable to reconnect with Isabelle and Maggie and haunted by a belief that Grace and Tommy are having an affair. He is a broken dangerous man - the kind of person who has been shaped into a weapon but no longer has a clear focus. By rising above politics and simplistic notions about whether the current war is ""right"" or ""wrong"" Brothers is able to offer honest compelling drama. The film is not unremittingly bleak; in fact impulses of love and caring define all of the characters in one way or another. The situation is heartbreaking but Sheridan does not flinch in depicting the events that break and remake Sam from the loving man he was into the cold shell who returns. The film ends not mired in bleakness but on a well-earned note of hope. Brothers is defined by strong performances as is necessary for any drama of this magnitude to achieve success. Natalie Portman once deemed to be one of cinemas finest child actors has floundered in recent years with unremarkable appearances in films like The Other Boleyn Girl Love and Other Impossible Pursuits and Mr. Magoriums Wonder Emporium. In Brothers she recaptures the consistency and ability to inhabit a character that has defined her best work. Tobey Maguire who is essentially forced to play two different parts has the films most challenging role and rises to the occasion. No one will think of him as Peter Parker here even though that alter-ego looms large over his career. Jake Gyllenhaal is also solid as Tommy who has his own demons to fight - albeit ones not as monstrous as Sams. Excellent support is provided by Sam Shepard as the military Dad whose past has laid the seeds for the present and Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare two of the screens most unaffected recent child actors. The reason Brothers works as well as it does is because it takes the time to introduce the characters and never loses sight that the story is about their changes and how those alterations impact their relationships with others. The movies message emerges naturally through the narrative - it is not represented by a tacked-on homily or awkward speech. Sheridan does not say war is evil but he makes it clear that the dead arent the only casualties of conflicts. Just because a soldier is back on the ground in the United States does not mean he or she is ""safe."" When Sam pleads with his commanding officer to return to Afghanistan following his ""resurrection"" his reasons are clear - the only connection he retains is to the ugliness half-a-world away. He seeks expiation perhaps through death and its something he cannot find in the pleasantly domestic setting represented by his wife children and brother. This is a rich thoughtful challenging motion picture and one of 2009s best.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Beyond the Call of Duty Every star of Jim Sheridans Brothers outdoes expectations. Plus a flighty adaptation of Up in the Air. _ By David Edelstein Published Nov 30 2009 ShareThis (Photo Lorey Sebastian/Courtesy of Lionsgate) Empathy must come as naturally as breathing to the Irishman Jim Sheridan director of My Left Foot In America and now the overpoweringly intimate Brothers. Working with screenwriter David Benioff (25th Hour) he skips among three protagonists and emotional states without losing the storys pulse Every narrative beat is also a heartbeat. Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal are Sam and Tommy Cahill one an upright Army captain on his way back to Afghanistan the other a delinquent newly paroled after a three-year sentence for robbery. Natalie Portman is Sams ex-cheerleader wife Grace who can barely stand the sight of Tommy. The extended family features Sam Shepard as the brothers alcoholic ex-Army dad Mare Winningham as their stepmother and Bailee Madison and Taylor Geare as Sams young daughters. Despite the title the movies center its fulcrum isnt the brothers but the whole teetering clan. When early on Sams chopper goes down in Afghanistan and word comes back that hes dead the family structure collapses and is slowly rebuilt the pieces rearranging themselves in strange new ways. Sheridan gets inside his characters heads without ever viewing them in isolation Even separated by continents no one can move without hitting someone else. Who could have guessed that the stars who made their names as nerd heroes Peter Parker and Donnie Darko could be so credibly messed-up and volatile? Maguire isnt big but his tautness radiates strength. Sam loves his family but hes driven to be with his men Single-mindedness is his goal. When hes captured and thrown in a pit with a private named Joe Willis (Patrick Flueger) he coldly orders the man to forget his familyto forget everything but his name and rankand the question as hes starved and tortured is whether hes as impregnable as he thinks he is. At times Brothers is like a less-mythical (and -pretentious) The Deer Hunter with Maguire even managing to suggest something of Robert De Niro when he was young and thin and wiredwhen you could see his every cell react. As to the other two leads Sheridan has gotten the best performances of their young lives. As much as I like Gyllenhaal Ive often found him fuzzy as if hes wary of losing control. Is that why hes so affecting here? The dissolute Tommy turns out to be as tightly wound as his older brother only too scared to focus. He looks pitifully vulnerable as he the supposedly dead Sams family and becomes protective. Portman has the kind of role that turns actresses into dullards the wife who stands and looks stricken at her man (or men) in paroxysms of rage and grief. But shes so grounded that as the others carry on your eyes keep drifting to her. Yes shes almost unbearably pretty but its her immediacy that keeps you glued to her face. Sheridan pulls you so deep into Brothers so fast that there isnt time for the alarm bell to go off that says Warning Another Traumatized-Vet Movie You never catch Sheridan or Benioff grandstanding only observing. (Brothers is based on a 2004 Danish film I havent seen but unlike most such remakes it feels organic.) The cinematographer Fred Elmes uses color to convey inner states without calling attention to itself and Jay Cassidys editing in two fraught dinner-table scenes is so exquisitely calibrated its as if the cuts were generated by the characters psyches. The crosscurrents keep you scanning the frame from Shepards subtly vibrating features (hes never been better) to the lovely girls each with her own distinct reaction. In the role of Private Williss wife a blonde actress I couldnt place was so real I scribbled something about her being a star someday. Too late Carey Mulligan has already wowed audiences in An Education. I liked her better here. Shes not as dazzling but she doesnt have to exaggerate her naivete. Sheridans actors work with their intellects fully engagedand they engage us on levels we barely knew we had. Up in the Air has a confident hum. George Clooney plays Ryan Bingham a man who specializes in flying from city to city to inform workers theyve been laid off help manage their emotions and hand them their packetseverance COBRA etc. On the side he gives motivational speeches on lightening the metaphorical backpack of ones life. Bingham tells us in voice-over that hes only at home in the air and that in the past year he has spent 322 days on the road and 43 miserable days in his nearly bare Omaha apartment. Hes cool sharp briskbut we can see where the movies headed from 3000 miles away. Bingham has to learn that connections arent just things you make in airports. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Susanne Biers emotionally harrowing melodrama about the toll of war on the home front has become a lesser thing in Jim Sheridans English-language remake of ""Brothers."" Though it renders a convincing portrait of fractured family life and boasts its share of powerfully acted moments this schematic tale of two siblings ripped apart by jealousy misunderstanding and unshakable trauma plays like a more polished but less effective twin to the 2004 Danish original. The names of Tobey Maguire Natalie Portman and Jake Gyllenhaal should lure a respectable arthouse/mainstream contingent to this solidly accessible admirably serious yet not entirely realized picture. Adapted by David Benioff from Bier and Anders Thomas Jensens script ""Brothers"" faithfully retains its predecessors structure almost scene for scene. One unfortunate departure occurs at the outset as Capt. Sam Cahill (Maguire) preparing to join his fellow Marines on a fourth tour of duty in Afghanistan circa October 2007 writes a letter (partially read in voiceover) to be given to his wife in the event of his death -- a device that foreshadows yet also sentimentalizes much of whats to come. Shortly before Sam ships out his petty-crook younger brother Tommy (Gyllenhaal) is released from prison leading to an awkward homecoming as the Cahill clan welcomes back one son and sends off another. The fraught yet all-too-familiar dynamics are bluntly established as Sam and Tommys gruff dad (Sam Shepard) makes no secret of his preference for the decorated military hero over the scruffy neer-do-well. Sams loving wife Grace (Portman) with whom he has two daughters isnt too crazy about Tommy either. But when tragedy strikes and Sam is presumed dead in a helicopter crash Tommy gets his act together and becomes an unexpected source of strength and emotional ballast to Grace as the family mourns remodeling her kitchen and doting on young Isabelle (Bailee Madison) and Maggie (Taylor Geare). Its no spoiler to reveal that while Grace and Tommy bond over U2 and cigarettes Sam is alive if not well in Afghanistan where he and another soldier (Patrick Flueger) are held captive by Taliban fighters. Sam is ultimately rescued but his experiences have not left him unscarred or his home unchanged. Emotionally cold toward his girls and irrationally suspicious of Grace and Tommy Sam directs his pain both inward and outward building to the films most riveting scene -- a dinner-party sequence in which Sheridan and editor Jay Cassidy bring a small storm of repressed tensions and domestic anxieties shockingly to the surface. Pic crosscuts more convulsively between home and Afghanistan than Biers film did; while this is perhaps intended to ratchet up the tension and make Sams wounds accrue more gradually it serves only to throw the scripts contrivances into high relief. Moreso than in the Danish picture one senses a God-like (or Guillermo Arriaga-like) hand at work stretching across continents to move these poor characters into their tortured positions. The stylistic differences between the two films are even more pronounced. Shot with a restless handheld camera Biers ""Brothers"" achieved a fleet Dogma-inflected realism that tempered the melodrama; Sheridans ""Brothers"" is an altogether more calculated object with its meticulous setups meaningful pauses and young attractive Hollywood cast. Still that cast largely impresses. Portman has rarely been more movingly subdued as a wife and mother who refuses to let grief overpower her sense of responsibility while Gyllenhaal is effortlessly believable as a drifter who finds to his delight and ours that fatherhood suits him well. Sheridans empathetic touch with tyke actresses so evident in 2003s ""In America"" pays off beautifully in his work with young Madison whos heartbreaking as the older and wiser of the two Cahill girls. With his crew cut and stiff posture (in contrast to Gyllenhaals looser stance) Maguire is downright scary as a guy who seems to be headed the way of Pvt. Pyle in ""Full Metal Jacket."" But he still looks a tad boyish for the part (Ulrich Thomsen was in his 40s when he played the role for Bier) and his decision to go explosively over-the-top at moments only exposes Sam as a psychological construct -- more walking antiwar statement than full-blooded human being. Even when the dramatic carpentry is less than sturdy the filmmaking remains precise and assured; Sheridans maiden collaboration with ace d.p. Fred Elmes delivers sterling widescreen results with New Mexico doing double duty as small-town America and Afghanistan. A plaintive guitar theme grounds Thomas Newmans score though other soundtrack choices are more intrusive. Closing credits are accompanied by U2s ""Winter"" which is apt considering the thick presumably cleansing snow that blankets the films final chapters.
