The prospect of spine-tingling visuals will be enough to lure a sizable mainstream aud looking for big thrills. Extravagant technical prowess has been channeled to negligible effect in ""The Haunting"" a wannabe horror classic that turns deadly dull once the sense of anxious expectation wears off. The fabulous sets and elaborate and occasionally graceful special effects provide the 80 million production with its only distinction and no doubt the prospect of spine-tingling visuals will be enough to lure a sizable mainstream aud looking for big thrills. But the pics incredibly hokey premise and surpassing inability to elicit shocks and scares will prevent it from reaching the full potential a good film of this nature could achieve. Its abundantly clear that no expense has been spared in the attempt to rev up the low-key spookiness of Robert Wises identically titled 1963 MGM film version of Shirley Jacksons ""The Haunting of Hill House"" to state-of-the-art levels of terror. However Jan De Bonts updating merely stands as yet another illustration of the fact that all the money in Hollywood cant necessarily buy imagination resourcefulness wit or apparently a decent script. This is a haunted house tale as high-tech as anyone could want but still as creaky as ""The Old Dark House."" Main gambit -- and selling point -- is that the sprawling mansion is actually ""alive"" with menace a threat that manifests itself in a torrent of heart-stopping sounds sudden apparitions shape-changing carvings and statues mutating walls and ceilings and so on. The numerous visual special and sound effects wizards have all earned their paychecks as their work is certainly eye-catching and distinct from the norm. But absolutely none of it is remotely scary; the only gasp or to be generous quasi-scream heard at the premiere screening was generated by one of the oldest tricks in the book -- a hidden skeleton suddenly lurching up straight into the camera. At least if the picture had been in 3-D such a cheap gag would have been understandable. But no this is supposed to be a class act as one can tell from the cast visual opulence and literary pedigree. All the same the ruse used to assemble then keep the characters under the houses suspicious roof would have seemed lame even in some of the lesser efforts of Jack Arnold and Sam Arkoff the eminent respective fathers of two of this pics producers Susan Arnold and Donna Arkoff Roth. Cover story is that researcher Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson) is recruiting several insomniacs for a study of sleep disorders. In reality he wants to test theories he has about fear -- that it stems from automatic responses that generally have no justifiable basis -- and what better place to do so than in a creepy place like this one? He rounds up three volunteers Nell (Lili Taylor) a withdrawn impressionable woman who has spent most of her life caring for her late mother; Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a raffish artist and woman of the world whos the diametric opposite of Nell; and Luke (Owen Wilson) a man of no particular distinction save his occasional attempt at wry humor. Marrow explains that their temporary abode -- a spectacular mix of baroque Gothic Victorian and other styles for the interiors concocted by production designer Eugenio Zanetti -- was built by a 19th-century New England tycoon who envisioned it as a home for many children although he wound up having none. Strangely the mansion is decorated with countless statues busts and paintings of cherubs and tykes who -- as the empathetic Nell comes to understand -- are the spirits of the many children who suffered and died in the industrialists employment and are caught in a sort of purgatory awaiting a release she alone can provide. Theme is resonant enough and provides at least one character with some motivation for sticking around and navigating the considerable inconveniences of the house. This is more than can be said for the others however who have little reason to be there in the first place and less to stay. Worse than that as written by first-time screenwriter David Self theyre bores whose few noticeable personality traits are quite irrelevant to anything that goes on. Much is made during the lengthy expository scenes about how important sex is to Theo and how shes bisexual but thats the last we ever hear about it. Much more weirdly Marrows assistant (Alix Koromzay) is seriously injured the first night in the house and heads for treatment in town accompanied by a young man (Todd Field) saying theyll be back. But they never turn up again. When Bruce Dern is the caretaker of an abandoned old mansion you know youre in trouble. In fact Marian Seldes in the brief role of his withered no-nonsense wife who warns the visitors about the house is the only performer here to hit the right tone of alert deadpan seriousness clearing out the genres cobwebs while sending up its hoariest conventions. Neeson is too earnest to make even his characters deceit interesting Zeta-Jones is not nearly as fascinating to watch as she was in her two previous big Hollywood pics and Wilson has his natural irreverence tapped down to a dangerously bland level. Only indie stalwart Taylor in her major-studio feature starring debut has something resembling a real role to play and she does so as capably as possible under the far-fetched circumstances. Pic essentially dooms itself from the outset with a setup that is too artificial for the subsequent drama to be compelling and with characters whose lack of a strong purpose severely limits their interest. The only thing that keeps you going for a time is the sense that its going to get better that something wild and scary is bound to happen eventually. The special effects guys do come up with some wild stuff -- a scene in which a childs ghost glides into Nells room on a billowing curtain then under her sheets and pillow proves particularly magical -- but for a real sense of dread this summer hip viewers will head for ""The Blair Witch Project"" which was made for about 1/800 the budget.

Starring Lili Taylor Catherine Zeta-Jones Liam Neeson and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jan De Bont. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres no excuse for ""The Haunting."" Its based on a great book ""The Haunting of Hill House "" by Shirley Jackson . A 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent. The only thing scary about the new version is realizing that someone keeps giving director Jan De Bont money to make movies. De Bont directed ""Speed 2 Cruise Control"" the biggest bomb of 1997 and ""The Haunting"" shows that De Bont is still oblivious to what constitutes film entertainment. While Jacksons novel was a masterpiece of subtlety the last half of ""The Haunting"" is a nearly nonstop wallow in snapping gargoyles and angry frescoes coming to life. Music blares. The floor shakes. Big metal doors slam and the noise echoes throughout the house. The ceiling smears and morphs and ghosts emerge -- and all of this every second every moment of screen time is absolutely without life. Its not scary macabre or funny. ""The Haunting"" which opens today is only a failure. What makes it irritating is that it didnt have to be a failure. But the adaptation by first-time screenwriter David Self is an amalgam of stupid choices. One example In the original story the characters go to Hill House simply to see if it really is haunted.But in the new movie Self muddies the waters by turning the characters into insomniacs who think theyre participating a sleep disorder study Yes its a sleep disorder study taking place in a freakish Gothic mansion the size of a city block. These are naive patients all right. Theres not a wall in the house that doesnt look like either an altar or a massive pipe organ. Of course their doctor isnt really interested in sleep patterns. He wants to study their reactions to fear. Liam Neeson plays Dr. Marrow the fear scholar who hopes to terrify his three insomniacs over the course of a weekend. He gets a lot of unwanted help from the house. Lili Taylor plays Eleanor a sheltered young woman who starts hallucinating her first night on the premises. Taylors moment-to-moment integrity -- her honesty her ability to register thought and feeling -- keeps ""The Haunting"" from being completely contemptible. Considering what shes up against thats an achievement. Everyone else comes away looking foolish. Catherine Zeta-Jones in a series of daring outfits breezes into the picture as Theo the sexy insomniac and almost immediately announces that she has both a girlfriend and a boyfriend. It has come to this bisexuality as an arbitrary character point like smoking or wearing a hat. The detail isnt there to mean something. Its there to seem like it does as though flung-together details could amount to a personality. When Eleanor admires her boots Theo answers ""Prada Milan Not New York"" In ""The Haunting"" Zeta-Jones seems less an actress and more a pretty face and not an interesting one at that. Owen Wilson plays the Generation X wise guy Luke but the last thing this kind of movie needs is an ironist. The script needs to build a mood not undercut it. De Bont not only doesnt build a mood he doesnt even seem to know what mood to build. He flails. Hell settle for laughs. Hell settle for thrills. Any reaction will do since his real focus is on putting together extended special-effects sequences The bed shakes the posts change shape and trap Eleanor in bed and -- but whats the use of describing it? It goes on and on and its as exciting as watching someone play a computer game. The only good news to be gleaned from ""The Haunting"" is that the filmmakers tried to prove that a good movie could be made with no talent just technology and it didnt work. ..

Its a horror flick afraid of its own...1999-07-30 D The Haunting (Movie - 1999) Genre Horror; Starring Owen Anderson Liam Neeson Lili Taylor Catherine Zeta-Jones; Director Jan de Bont; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted July 30 1999 -- 1200 AM EDT The scariest thing about The Haunting is how awful it is. No worse than awful desperate. Its a horror flick afraid of its own audience as lost in its own geography as the fictional film crew in The Blair Witch Project. But where the disorientation of the Blair Witch kids leads fright lovers to a novel experience of terror and suggests an inventive new direction for the genre the cluelessness of The Haunting -- a production grounded in old-fashioned horror conventions but undone by a new-fashioned know-it-all attitude -- points to the death of spookiness. It didnt have to be this way. Shirley Jacksons eerie 1959 novel The Haunting of Hill House tells of a trio of guests under the observation of a ""doctor of philosophy"" who gathers his subjects at the eponymous mansion to study ""the causes and effects of psychic disturbances in a house commonly known as haunted."" Eleanor also called Nell is a fearful spinster who has sacrificed her own happiness to care for a hateful invalid mother now dead; Theodora who calls herself Theo is a brazen provocative sybarite attracted to women as well as men; Luke is a flip and boorish manipulator who (in Jacksons book) also stands to inherit Hill House someday. For the author The Haunting of Hill House is a ghost story but its also clearly a journey of psychological and sexual awakening -- especially for the virginal Eleanor who hears the spirits of the place calling to her. When in thrall to voices (and her psyche) she ascends a perilous spiral staircase in an ""intoxicating"" climb with the doctor in manly pursuit thats suspense -- but its also sex baby. And Robert Wises 1963 adaptation of the book The Haunting in Bergmanesque black and white teases out the Freudian implications of every gargoyle with the kind of intense regard only an entire movie industry engrossed in psychoanalysis could produce. (You havent seen a groovy insinuation of lesbianism until youve seen Claire Bloom as Theo dressed head to toe in Mary Quant sidling up to Julie Harris Nell.) But -- to quote David Selfs dull-edged script in this latest anti-analytical update -- what is wrong with you people? With Freudian subtext gone the way of Im OK Youre OK and pre-ironic moviegoing innocence subverted by Scream and its ilk theres little left to interest us let alone haunt us in The Haunting. Sure there are movie stars emoting madly when not tossing off jaunty one-liners. And there are plenty of frightfully busy sets made even busier when they come alive -- sculptures lunging walls pulsing floorboards popping that sort of thing -- via computer-generated showmanship.

"Haunting The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; haunting-the_1103 ) Haunting The (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli The original The Haunting a low-budget 1963 haunted house film from director Robert Wise is a chilling little movie that offers a primer in scaring audiences without graphic bloodshed. Its a lesson that has largely been ignored by filmmakers over the past two decades at least until the arrival of this summers The Blair Witch Project one of the most innovative horror films in a long time. Now along comes a remake of The Haunting this time helmed by Jan de Bont (Speed Twister) a director who doesnt known the meaning of subtlety. He makes the fatal mistake of showing and telling too much (although he keeps the blood-and-gore quotient low) transforming his movies final half-hour into an unintentionally hilarious self-parody. Hill House is an enormous gothic mansion built on an isolated New England site in 1837. For more than a century it has remained uninhabited with only a caretaker and housekeeper to tend to its upkeep. Both live in town 9 miles away and neither will venture anywhere near the house after dark. Its to this locale that Dr. Jeffrey Marrow (Liam Neeson) brings a small group who have agreed to participate in an academic study he is conducting. They think its about sleep disorders (each of them has a form of insomnia) but its really about examining the ""primordial fear reaction."" Marrow intends to frighten them with strange stories and see what happens. His subjects are Eleanor (Lili Taylor) an insecure woman with a troubled past; Theodora (Catherine Zeta Jones) a frisky bisexual who brims with the self-confidence Eleanor lacks; and Luke (Owen Wilson) who is nearly as cocky and self-assured as Theo. The first half of The Haunting is surprisingly absorbing. The story moves slowly introducing us to Eleanor (the only character with any depth) then leading us on a room-by-room tour of Hill House as she and Theo explore its seemingly endless innards. They discover amazingly elaborate bedrooms and bathrooms a maze of hallways and a room with mirrored walls and a moving floor. Most doors are at least 15 feet high and creak and groan when opened. Stone cherubs gargoyles angels devils animals and other assorted oddities can be found everywhere. Hill House is a peculiar place where fairy tale images mate with those from twisted nightmares and ""Charles Foster Kane meets The Munsters."" Production designer Eugenio Zanetti and set designer Cosmas A. Demetriou deserve praise for their incredible work here. Sadly The Hauntings sole strength is in the setup. Once the characters are established inside the house and strange events start happening the films quality goes into a decline that becomes increasingly precipitous as the climax approaches. Only the first supernatural incident with Eleanor and Theo huddled together as something rattles the locked doors to their room is effective. The final 30 minutes are especially poorly done. The plot veers off into a series of absurd contrivances to explain certain events and the climactic struggle screams ""Deus ex machina"" Not since Sphere has the audience been subjected to such a pointless and demeaning cheat. On the other hand for those who choose to view this portion of The Haunting from a skewed perspective these excesses offer an opportunity for a number of hearty laughs few of which were intended or expected by de Bont and his screenwriter David Self (adapting from Shirley Jacksons novel). Okay so were probably not supposed to think too deeply about logical inconsistencies in a movie of this nature but theres something in The Haunting that really bothered me. When Hill Houses caretaker leaves for the evening he chains and locks the gate. Why? It doesnt make any sense. Whats even more confusing is how Dr. Marrow is able to unlock it on the first night when his assistant suffers an accident and has to be taken to the hospital but once his own life is in danger he cant get out. This isnt a subtle blunder that only nit-picking movie critics are likely to notice. Anyone who pays attention to the proceedings (admittedly a sometimes-difficult task) will recognize that theres a missing explanation. Irrespective of whether the fault is in the writing the editing or both its an example of sloppy filmmaking. For the second time this summer the normally reliable Liam Neeson turns in a bland performance. His work here however makes his outing in The Phantom Menace look brilliant by comparison. As Dr. Marrow Neeson doesnt have much screen time but when the camera is on him he often appears disinterested. Owen Wilson doesnt fare much better either in terms of exposure or effectiveness. Meanwhile Catherine Zeta Jones one of the hottest actresses performing today does what she can with the potentially-electric Theodora until she like Neeson and Wilson is relegated to the background. Shes got charisma but not enough to steal scenes she hardly appears in. The only performer with a real opportunity to shine is former indie princess Lili Taylor. For the first two-thirds of The Haunting Taylor gives an effective portrayal of an introspective woman gradually approaching a nervous breakdown. Unfortunately the melodramatic swirl of the ending envelops her warping her performance into something off-key and cartoonish. The Haunting cannot be considered a classically enjoyable bad movie because the strong beginning promises much more than the film ultimately delivers. Yes its possible to derive some enjoyment from the silliness of the climax and conclusion but its mixed with disappointment. One needs look no further than the 1963 version to understand how the same basic story can be done far more effectively. But with so much money being poured into special effects tension has been diffused and creativity lost. This film makes the common mistake of showing in great detail things that would be more terrifying if left to the imagination. As a result the only thing disturbing about The Haunting is how discouraging the end product is.

"The Haunting (PG-13) Related Item ""The Haunting"" showtimes Spooky but Not That Haunting By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 23 1999 Guests in this mansion become gripped with terror in ""The Haunting."" (DreamWorks) Director Jan De Bont Cast Catherine Zeta-Jones; Liam Neeson; Lili Taylor; Owen Wilson Running Time 1 hour 53 minutes Contains strong language sexual innuendo and boo effects In ""The Haunting"" Jan De Bont the director who thrilled us with ""Speed"" but almost drowned us with ""Speed 2"" has shifted gears for a spookier ride. You can almost sense the special effects poised in the wings waiting for that Act III cue. We know the scary stuff is coming. Thats what keeps us waiting. Without giving too much away those effects are fairly impressive. Not amazing. There are a few BIG SCARY MOMENTS that get right in your face and go BOO But how is the wait? Thats important too. Most of the time we think characters in ghost or horror movies are scarcely worth our attention. After all they are going to spend most of the movie trying not to get killed mangled or spooked. Who needs to get to know them? These guys are on the dramatic equivalent of Death Row. In fact in many cases were happy to see them go. But the fact is the more a movie delves into its characters the more we connect with them. Which makes the possibility of their doom even scarier. In Stanley Kubricks ""The Shining"" were as creeped out by whats happening inside Jack Nicholsons head as we are by the haunted house where he is staying. The story in ""The Haunting"" takes the character high road but only with Lili Taylor. And only up to a point. She plays Nell a lonely single woman who checks into a haunted house thinking she just signed up for a sleep disorder study. Wrong. This study which brings her and two others to an over-the-top Addams Family mansion in the Berkshires is about fear. Dr. David Marrow (Liam Neeson - and what in the blue blazes is he doing in a movie like this?) is really conducting research into the knee-jerk fears that rule our lives. I have no idea what he ultimately does with his work but he claims to be working for humankind. The patients including the extroverted Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and the odd Luke (Owen Wilson) are unwittingly participating in a psychological suggestion experiment Put em in a scary house pass along a chilly rumor or two watch what happens. But when Nell really starts seeing and hearing things around the mansion everyone starts to realize this house is seriously weird. The character revelations about Nell arent that mind-blowing. And the people around her are even less interesting. There is welcome comic relief from Wilson as the goofball-insomniac who gets to utter all the dumb horror-movie lines like ""Lets get out of here"" But Neesons doctor isnt much more than a walking piece of exposition. And as Theo a va-va-voom Girl from the City Zeta-Jones hardly gets a Bette Davis role. Which puts all the more pressure on director De Bonts bag of tricks. Ghostly they are. And Eugenio Zanettis set design is wonderful. But the movie isnt enough to make people check the shadows when they leave the theater.
