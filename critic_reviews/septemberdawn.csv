Slow Hand Releasing hide caption toggle caption Slow Hand Releasing Director Christopher CainGenre Drama RomanceRunning Time 110 minutes Jon Voight stars in a handsome but ham-fisted melodrama about the Mountain Meadows Massacre a Sept. 11 slaughter of Christian innocents that had its roots in religious extremism. Never heard of it you say? Well it was a different Sept. 11 -- the one 150 years ago next month in fact -- and it was in the territory that would become the state of Utah. And the extremists depicted here as paranoid bloodthirsty and prone to speechifying were Mormons. For dramatic purposes the filmmakers have cooked up a fictional Mormon rabble-rouser (Voight) whose handsome son (Trent Ford) is the films token conscience-stricken Latter-day Saint. The lad falls for a pretty settler on a passing wagon train headed for California and is planning to leave the community with her when his father orchestrates a cataclysmic attack in which the all the settlers are disarmed and then slaughtered. The film hints broadly that Mormon patriarch Brigham Young (Terence Stamp) himself had a hand in planning the massacre which is an actual historical event however freely its being depicted here. September Dawns producers are presumably counting on disputes about the accuracy of that depiction as well as broader protests from the Mormon community to help publicize the film -- which is beautifully photographed and almost stupefyingly didactic.

Comments September Dawn Written and directed by Christopher Cain (Young Guns) this squishy historical drama revisits the Mountain Meadows massacre of 1857 when renegade Mormons wiped out 120 settlers crossing the Utah Territory. The Mormon churchs complicated relationship with the U.S. government in the 1850s is a fascinating subject but much of Cains cartoonish treatment is given over to a trite Romeo-and-Juliet romance between a pretty young Mormon (Trent Ford) and a liberal-minded settler (Tamara Hope). The villainous turns by Jon Voight (as a hard-hearted Mormon bishop) and Terence Stamp (as a bloodthirsty Brigham Young) would have been more fun if they werent part of such a clumsy campaign to lay this tragedy at the churchs doorstep.

What was the travelers crime? According to September Dawn a plodding and highly questionable history lesson the interlopers werent Christian enough. Many of them were from Arkansas (how sinful); one of their women wore pants. The audience gets the message (religious fanaticism bad) but nothing we see is convincing on its own -- not Jon Voight in a silly beard doing his benignly scowling understated-overacting bit; nor the slaughter which is all blood packs and zero horror.

I was baffled Why does this film even exist? In the last act came the answer The 1857 massacre of settlers it depicts happened on Sept. 11. So its more Sept. 11 porn about a wagon train of pioneers heading for California but stopping in the Utah Territory for a rest. A Mormon bishop (Jon Voight) welcomes them and invites them to stay for two weeks. But back at church he gets his holy underwear in a twist preaching that he just saw ""an abomination"" - a woman in pants. Hey buddy not everyone can pull off a denim mini and tights. Voight spends the movie glaring and cursing and heaving his arms in the air as if to signal a miraculous succession of touchdowns or perhaps just to get in some light stretching before the massacrin begins. When the settlers started mumbling ""I have a bad feeling about this place"" I had a bad feeling that the screenwriters were so dumb they didnt even know they were ripping off ""Star Wars."" Then various characters experienced flashbacks by scrunching their foreheads while scenes from bygone days were superimposed over their pensive faces a technique last used in Kodak commercials in 1977. The bishop has two sons one of whom instantly falls in love with a blond settler whose horse needs some whispering. When the pair finally get together its to issue banalities such as ""Youre the prettiest girl Ive ever seen and you speak your mind"" or ""Hold me Dont ever let me go."" These characters are made up but lurking in the shadows is Brigham Young upon whom the movie pins the massacre. Young has been called many things but is not usually accused of being British. As Terence Stamp plays him with no effort to hide his General Zod accent he and Voights character get cozily demented together frothing like a pair of venti cappuccinos.

BY Jack Mathews Friday August 24 2007 400 AM September Dawn. Drama based on the 1857 massacre of 120 pioneers by Mormons in Utah. With Jon Voight Trent Ford Tamara Hope. Director Christopher Cain (151). R Violence. At AMC Empire UA 64th St. and Second Ave. Royal Union Square. When Jonathan Samuelson (Trent Ford) locks eyes with beautiful Emily Hudson (Tamara Hope) in the serene Utah valley of Mountain Meadows its not only love at first sight but forever. Still when this scene occurs in Christopher Cains disturbingly awful ""September Dawn"" there are heavy portents of trouble. Jonathans father Mormon bishop Samuelson (Jon Voight) is crazier than a bed bug and Emilys father the Rev. Hudson (Daniel Libman) is everything the bishop hates. Lovers often face a potential in-law problems but this one in the historical setting of the infamous 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre is insurmountable. ""September Dawn"" written by an evangelical Christian may be the worst historical drama ever made. Not because it is about to offend one of the countrys fastest growing religions - Mitt Romney beware - but because in placing a glib romantic fable at its center it trivializes one of Americas ugliest and least understood events. The Mountain Meadows Massacre graphically reenacted here occurred during the so-called Utah War when U.S. troops were preparing to dislodge Mormon prophet and 27-wived Brigham Young as the territorial governor. When the Baker-Fancher wagon train entered the territory many Mormons believed they were in cahoots with the government and though it was never proven that Young sanctioned the slaughter it was clearly conducted by church minions with the help of Paiute Indians. Those local Mormons are led in the film by the fictional 18-wived Samuelson and Cain does everything but fire thunder out of the soundtrack to isolate him as the Devil. The massacre was certainly demonic business but a little more context please. The love story though is downright insulting. Were to believe that a look can expunge a lifetime of radical religious thought from Jonathan. Suddenly hes not only California dreaming but praising the concept of monogamy. I wasnt raised by religious fanatics but Im guessing that the beliefs they press on their children are strong enough to sustain them through their first kiss. When the Mormons of that day said ""There are many more fish in the sea"" they were talking about wives.

September Dawn Movie Review amp; Film Summary (2007) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/september-dawn-2007,200,septemberdawn10,septemberdawn,rogerebert
"Revisiting an ugly chapter of US history - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Events    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies Movie Review Revisiting an ugly chapter of US history Jon Voight plays a Mormon leader in ""September Dawn"" a fictionalized account of a massacre of settlers heading west in 1857. (Black Diamond Pictures via associated press) By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  August 24 2007 ""September Dawn"" commemorates the Mountain Meadows Massacre of Sept. 11 1857 in which a party of Mormon militiamen murdered 120 settlers bound for California. True believers probably wont like it but the sins here are more against good filmmaking than religion. Can a moviegoer ask for blood atonement along with a ticket refund?All right the movie isnt that bad -- its just made-for-TV historical treacle that has somehow found its way to the big screen (and barely that; if you want to be moved or outraged by the film youll have to travel to Danvers or Revere). Director/co-writer Christopher Cain tells the tale ploddingly and the script he has written with Carole Whang Schutter hits one cliched note after another with a dull bong.The facts are these In 1857 the Mormon faithful under Brigham Young had reached a pitch of near-complete paranoia. Following the murder of founder Joseph Smith in Missouri the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had relocated to Utah. Church leader Young served as territorial governor until revelations of Mormon polygamy prompted Washington to rescind the appointment and send troops to restore the infant theocracy to US control.The Utah Mormons were convinced they were about to be wiped out. End-times beliefs and a justified persecution complex combined to create a mindset of Branch Davidian proportions -- and into this tinderbox rode the Fancher-Baker wagon train. As soon as Captain Fancher (Shaun Johnston) informs the LDS greeting party in ""September Dawn"" that his pioneers are from Missouri we know theyre doomed.After a joint siege of the wagon train by a Mormon militia and local Native American tribesmen the former lured the settlers out under a white flag -- then shot men women and children in cold blood. Twenty years later after the Civil War had come and gone one of the ringleaders John D. Lee was found guilty and executed. Brigham Youngs involvement has been rumored but never proven.That doesnt stop Cain and Schutter. They wheel on a wild-eyed Young (Terence Stamp) delivering bloody-minded lines taken from the church leaders actual sermons. The major villain of the piece though is the fictional Jacob Samuelson played by a bewhiskered Jon Voight as if he were auditioning for a road-show production of ""Gods and Generals."" (Between this and ""Bratz"" its been a lousy month for the actor.)As Samuelson is fomenting against the infidels (""May these children of Satan go to Hell amen"" is his way of saying grace) his son Jonathan (Trent Ford) is falling for pretty Emily Hudson (Tamara Hope) of the Fancher party. This deeply unnecessary Romeo-and-Juliet subplot takes up a good chunk of running time as the two frolic in the moonlit river and argue adorably over theology.Hope turns in the movies only convincing performance although Jon Gries (Uncle Rico from ""Napoleon Dynamite"") is unexpectedly compelling as John D. Lee here presented as a scapegoat who carried out the will of a maddened people. The massacre itself is a dutifully filmed barbarity reenacted with balletic slow-motion and discreet fake blood. Then were back to the lovers and their final passion play.Its waxy Classics Illustrated cinema in other words with special cameos by the directors son Dean Cain as the martyred Joseph Smith and Lolita Davidovich (""Blaze"") as a rootin tootin emigrant who shocks the Mormon elders. ""September Dawn"" wants to shock them too and us in the bargain but it only serves to remind us of one of the uglier chapters in American history.

A bloody but little-known chapter of Mormon history gives director Christopher Cain plenty of ammo for a stinging attack on religious extremism in ""September Dawn."" With one eye fixed on current world events this handsome indie Western damningly recounts the 1857 slayings of 120 settlers passing through Utah but the didactic presentation grim speechifying and tacked-on love story all signify a less-than-healthy regard for the audiences intelligence. Limited commercial prospects will depend on the films ability to exploit Mormon outrage -- the louder the better -- with its angry and contentious view of a still-disputed tragedy. Taking a page from ""Titanic"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" Cain and co-scenarist Carole Whang Schutter have cooked up a doomed romance as an easy point of entry for young auds in particular. Pic otherwise aspires to a certain degree of authenticity especially in its climactic re-enactment of the Mountain Meadows Massacre details of which were drawn from the written confession of John D. Lee (the only person ever convicted and executed for his role in the atrocities). The film goes one step further alleging a cover-up of the fact that the killings were ordered by Lees adoptive father Brigham Young. As played by Terence Stamp with an ugly ever-present scowl the man who presided over the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1847 until his death in 1877 emerges onscreen as a pitiless self-righteous monster with a band of fanatical followers ever in his grip. Chief among these followers is Jacob Samuelson (Jon Voight) the bishop and leader of a Mormon community in southern Utah. When a California-bound wagon train arrives led by kindly Capt. Fancher (Shaun Johnston) Samuelson allows the settlers to rest in the nearby Mountain Meadows for two weeks but secretly instructs his sons Jonathan (Trent Ford) and Micah (Taylor Handley) to keep a close watch on these ""Gentile dogs."" Unlike Micah (a naive but precocious little polygamist) Jonathan is the storys token Mormon with a conscience -- good-looking sensitive the only man in town without a wife or two. He easily befriends the pioneers employing his devastatingly sexy whisper to tame first a wild stallion then the heart of a fetching blonde lass Emily (Tamara Hope); she in turn helpfully quotes Scripture (""Judge not lest ye be judged"") that leads Jonathan to question his fathers absolutist ways. First half of ""September Dawn"" is middling frontier soap opera marred by occasionally stilted dialogue and thesps who arent always at ease with the period diction. But the pic darkens irrevocably as Samuelson and the townsfolk descend into maniacal bloodlust Convincing themselves that the settlers were involved in the murder of Joseph Smith (played by Dean Cain the helmers son in gray-toned flashback) and other Mormon prophets they demand justice in the form of ""blood atonement."" A violent montage overlaid with excerpts from Youngs own writings elucidates this chilling doctrine -- that sinners must be redeemed not through faith in Christ but through their own bloodshed. Perversely then Young Samuelson and their hysterical ilk see themselves as mercy killers meting out salvation in the form of death. At Samuelsons insistence Lee (Jon Gries) pressures the local Paiute Indians to attack the wagon train but the resulting siege merely sets the stage for a bloody coup de grace that leaves no doubt about the true villains of the piece. Auds may rightly recoil from the graphically staged finale with its almost fetishistic focus on the guttings of women and children all shot in slow-mo and edited together in a flurry of impressionistic dissolves. Its not torture porn; its massacre porn. Cains portrait of sanctimonious hypocrisy is certainly unflinching encouraging viewers to draw their own parallels between modern-day and Latter-day terrorists (and carefully emphasizing that the Utah slayings took place on Sept. 11 1857). But the pic is ultimately less interested in understanding its Mormon characters than in demonizing them and a ham-fisted obviousness undermines scene after scene (such as one that juxtaposes the travelers heartfelt prayers with Samuelsons fire-and-brimstone denunciations). Nor does the pic convey any insights into the psychology of extremism aside from some choice moments in Voights persuasively complex performance. Well-scouted Calgary locations are beautifully photographed by Juan-Ruiz Anchia showing off sun-dappled pastures and mountainous landscapes to good effect though a dearth of establishing shots deny the pic a coherent sense of geography. William Ross elegiac sometimes overpowering score provides sturdy support throughout.
