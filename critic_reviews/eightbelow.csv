Comments Eight Below Live-action animal adventures have always been a Disney specialty and this one has a pretty compelling plot inspired by the true story of a Japanese antarctic expedition in the late 50s. A young guide (Paul Walker) and his trusty sled-dog team take a UCLA researcher (Bruce Greenwood) across a glacier to recover a meteorite; though the dogs save the doctors keister more than once theyre left behind when an unexpected storm forces the expedition team to evacuate. The second half drags crosscutting between Walker as he tries to drum up a rescue party and the dogs as they tough it out in the subzero cold but the survival drama is genuinely exciting and the players both human and canine put this across with spirit.

After Lassie Greyfriars Bobby and the abominable Shaggy Dog comes this likeable adventure set in the wastelands of Antarctica. Its inspired by a true story from 1957 about a pack of husky sled-dogs that had to be abandoned when all the scientists were forced to evacuate ahead of a storm. In the film the dogs charge survival guide Jerry Shepard (Paul Walker) is devastated that there isnt enough space to get his eight dogs into the emergency plane but he knows it wont be long before hell rescue them. The weather though has a different agenda...Frank Marshalls latest addresses notions of hardship endeavour and loyalty without ladling on the mush. But its still dogged by padding and lumbered with too many subplots improbabilities and contrived moments of tension. Despite all that its heartwarming occasionally exciting and some of the cinematography is exemplary.

It gets TOP STAR.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 1 2007Michelle MooreFeaturedTalk about a bitch of a film shoot; sub-freezing temperatures ice fields dogs and killer sealsaEUR|it can only be the new Walt Disney feature film Eight Below. Based on a Japanese Antarctic film and inspired by a real-life story of sled dogs who survived extended subzero abandonment In the extreme wilderness of Antarctica Paul Walker plays Jerry Shepard a guide at a research base. When a University Professor arrives asking to be taken to Mount Melbourne in an attempt to find a rare meteorite ShepardaEUR(tm)s intuition tells him it is too late in the season to make the treacherous route yet he agrees. Worried about the snowmobile breaking through the thinning ice he elects to use his beloved dog sled team for the journey. Upon their return Shepard pauses to patch up one of the dogs the professor slides down an embankment through thin ice and almost drowns. With both men battling hypothermia and frostbite it is the dogs stamina and keen sense of direction that gets them back to base. All personal are immediately evacuated unfortunately they must leave the dogs and return for them later. As the storm worsens it becomes clear no rescue will be attempted until the next spring. The movie proceeds to profile the dogsaEUR(tm) plight and Walker scrambling for months to get his furry friends back. Stranded the intelligent courageous dogs spend the next six months fighting for survival and battling the Antarctic wilderness. Heartbroken Shepard tries all avenues to return for his beloved dogs and more than six months later he is given the opportunity. Six of the eight dogs survive by eating whatever they could get their paws on; birds and whale. It shows that even though there is little food available the dogs look out for each other share food and make sure no one is left behind. The Verdict As far as non-animated Disney films go this is one of the best I have seen in along time. Outdoorsy Paul Walker knows exactly what flick would suit him. Last summer he went deep sea diving in the Bahamas in Into the Blue and this film seeaEUR(tm)s him stride through ice and snow with a pack of Huskies. With no troubles he manages to effectively convey a guy dedicated to rescuing his best friends. Movies about animals always live with the temptation to give them human characteristics. Lassie could do nearly all things humans could well except dial the telephone and drive a car maybe. March of the Penguins involved the penguins expressing themselves in voiceover dialogue. This story seeaEUR(tm)s the dogs as exactly what they are. It is remarkable how in a film where we know most of the dogs must survive it succeeds as an effective story by focusing on the dogs rather than the humans and pulling the audience into the incredible adventure. While Walker hunts for help to save his beloved dogs the subtitles keep count of how long the dogs have been on their own 50 days ... 133 days ... 155 days. Even though it was not shot in Antarctica but rather the ice capped mountains in British Columbia and Greenland there is some spectacular ice-cap photography and audiences are unable to tell the difference. In a tale of survival and friendship this film makes anyone want to grab your favourite pet and promise youll never leave them. Eight Below delivers a bracing blast of puppy power that helps dispel the outrageously boring and quite dreadful Disneys 2002 films Snow Dogs.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map },http://www.timeout.com/film/83457.html,200,eightbelow1,eightbelow,timeout
"The genteel dogs of Eight Below. Slate Sign In Sign Up The genteel dogs of Eight Below. The genteel dogs of Eight Below. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Feb. 23 2006 517 PM A Dog-Eat-Dog Continent Canines stranded in Antarctica in Disneys Eight Below. By Emily Yoffe Old Jack and Paul Walker Whenever I watch a nature movie as I root for the protagonists to eat any other living creature that flies or waddles along I know that I would feel different if the movie were told from the perspective of the prey. During Eight Below (Walt Disney Pictures) there I was hoping the sled dogs would decimate Antarcticas native fauna and rip to shreds its fowl. (Or all fowl except penguins--the filmmakers wisely realized they would lose their audience if the dogs ate the stars of March of the Penguins.) Of course in a seal or bird movie these dogs would be vicious interlopers stand-ins for corrupt humanity. Emily Yoffe Emily Yoffe is the author of What the Dog Did Tales From a Formerly Reluctant Dog Owner. Eight Below the No. 1 movie in the country this week is the Disney story of a team of sled dogs abandoned for six months to the Antarctic winter when their master and a visiting scientist are injured and must be evacuated before the arrival of an epic storm. It is based on a real Japanese expedition in 1957 which was made into a 1983 Japanese movie. It turns out that what happens in real life when dogs are abandoned in Antarctica is that most of them die. When the Japanese explorers returned they found that seven of the nine had perished. (The Japanese filmmakers upped the mortality and melancholy by portraying two survivors out of a team of 15.) Advertisement I took my 10-year-old daughter and her 9-year-old friend Michaela and for all of us the movie was painless (this is a compliment). I was relieved it was free of the self-referential show-business patter that infects so many of Disneys animated movies. But both girls so completely understood the conflict between Disney movie conventions and reality that they found Eight Below easy to resist. ""It was too much of a medical miracle"" said my daughter. ""The dogs wouldnt have survived on sea gulls for 180 days."" Michaela said that while she knew some of the dogs would die ""I knew more would live or else it would be too depressing. But I didnt cry because I thought if Im weak for this movie Ill need 70 million tissues."" One thing a movie set in ice and snow should give you is the feeling that if you sighed in the theater you would see your breath. The cold was an insinuating presence in both March of the Penguins and Touching the Void. But it seems only intermittently chilly in Eight Below. And instead of experiencing snow blindness you are more likely to feel blinded by the white teeth of the leading men Paul Walker as Jerry and the sled dog D.J. as Max. Both also have startling aquamarine eyes (although D.J. manages to be more expressive with his) and dark-eyed beauties as love interests. The human and canine romances are portrayed with such plodding parallelism that my daughter leaned over and said ""Jerry and Katie are like Max and Maya."" Of the long long-awaited kiss between the humans my daughter was resigned. ""It was going to happen. It had to."" After the humans leave Antarctica the movie bifurcates into the silent engrossing story of the dogs struggle and the dreary repetitive attempts by Jerry to get to them. Eight Below runs two hours and would have benefited from losing 30 minutes of that--all of it from Jerrys protracted quest. The other human actors are simply types. When Bruce Greenwood shows up as the scientist looking for a meteorite his boyish cragginess screams egomaniac. Jason Biggs as the cartographer Charlie has a distracting hairdo that looks like a Beatles wig circa 1963. He was leading man material in the American Pie series but here he is a throwback the ethnic pal exuding shtick. Then there is August Schellenberg as Mindo the ponytailed Native American who speaks in Disney Indian epigrams ""Finding whats important is finding that one thing that will truly put your heart at rest."" The best scenes were of the dogs growing realization that the meals provided by Jerry had been an example of the soft bigotry of low expectations. Stripped of his disempowering handouts they become fully functioning members of the ownership society. The dogs learn to fight for themselves and eventually tangle with a (computer-generated) leopard seal in the movies most thrilling encounter. (Although did the seal have to be such a grotesque monster? Lets face it the seals were there first.) The girls were impressed by but slightly skeptical of the idealized portrayal of the starving sled dogs selflessly sharing food. Michaela observed of her two bichon havanese ""If they found one bird they both would be saying Mine "" And as Roger Ebert has pointed out director Frank Marshall also directed Alive the movie in which a Uruguayan rugby team stranded in the snow of the Andes after a plane crash resorts to eating their dead teammates to survive. But rugby is a dog-eat-dog sport; in Eight Below the sled dogs sensibilities are more refined. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Eight Below"" with Paul Walker Bruce Greenwood Moon Bloodgood Jason Biggs. Directed by Frank Marshall from a screenplay by Dave DiGilio. 120 minutes. Rated PG for some peril and brief mild language. Several theaters. The appealing cast of ""Eight Below"" co-stars with six Siberian huskies and two malamutes and the intrepid sled dogs steal the show so handily that youll wonder why they didnt get top billing. Granted the human actors are likable enough. With his blazing blue eyes Paul Walker (star of ""The Fast and the Furious"") isnt exactly the next Paul Newman but his sincere presence is well-suited to this splendid Disney adventure. Walker plays a sled-team guide for a research outpost in Antarctica whose devotion kicks in when his sled dogs are endangered. Under the no-nonsense direction of veteran producer Frank Marshall (directing his first film since the 1995 flop ""Congo"") ""Eight Below"" becomes robust family entertainment and a dog lovers delight. The inspiring story is loosely based on actual events from 1957 to 58 (previously filmed as the acclaimed 1983 Japanese film ""Antarctica"") in which sled dogs on a Japanese expedition were stranded for six months during a harsh Antarctic winter. In ""Eight Below"" the team is smaller and the survival rate higher but the story (set in early 1993) boasts the same crowd-pleasing ingredients of breathtaking locations (in Norway Greenland and Canada) a dangerous journey and photogenic dogs playing the ultimate game of ""Survivor Antarctica."" Tempting fate Jerry Shepard (Walker) guides his sled team to a remote mountain where a renowned geologist (Bruce Greenwood) seeks a meteorite fragment from Mercury. They barely return alive when ""the worst storm in 25 years"" forces them to evacuate with supply-plane pilot -- and Jerrys former flame -- Katie (Moon Bloodgood) and goofball cartographer Cooper (Jason Biggs). With no room on the plane the dogs must endure the winter alone. While guilt-ridden Jerry struggles for months to mount a rescue mission periodic titles keep a running tally of the dogs treacherous ""days on their own."" The human drama is routine but the dog sequences are outstanding. Apart from a genuinely frightening encounter with a leopard seal and a dazzling display of aurora australis (or Southern Lights) digital effects and animatronics are kept to a minimum leaving canine charisma to spare. If you dont choke up at least once during the dogs engaging adventure you obviously prefer cats.

KG Photo CHRIS LARGE Mans 8 best friends get the cold shoulder 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Eight Below Drama. Starring Paul Walker Bruce Greenwood Jason Biggs and Moon Bloodgood. Directed by Frank Marshall. (PG. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Eight Below"" is a Disney film that is ""inspired by a true story"" which means that events that appear to be happening to a white dude from Oregon in 1993 are actually based on the experiences of some Japanese guys in 1958. By this standard what isnt inspired by a true story? Was ""Barbershop"" inspired by a haircut Ice Cube got back in 1974? Was ""Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines"" inspired by the time director James Camerons hair dryer got a mind of its own and shorted out all the circuits in the master bedroom suite? That distortion by the ""Eight Below"" filmmakers will be easy enough to keep from your kids. But unfortunately this tale of sled dogs fighting to survive in Antarctica and the man who tries to save them has bigger problems. The movie is overly long and much too intense for small children yet its filled with dialogue and plot turns that are too juvenile to thrill adult audiences. Its a movie notable mostly for a scene so bizarre -- a leopard seal which appears to be living in the body cavity of a killer whale pops out and attacks some dogs -- that it would seem out of place on ""Lost."" The finished product is two hours long and you can expect to spend another two hours talking with your child about the grislier parts of the film. ""Eight Below"" begins innocently enough. Gerry Shepherd (Paul Walker) is a survival guide for some kind of base station in Antarctica. He spends his days clowning around with his cartographer friend Cooper (Jason Biggs not funny here) and flirting with pilot Katie (Moon Bloodgood who looked considerably less wholesome in a very un-Disney Maxim magazine spread a few months back). After the dogs rescue Shepherd and a scientist during a treacherous trip where both are injured theyre left outdoors to fend for themselves during a long cold season. Most of the film cuts between Shepherd dealing with his guilt and the dogs fighting to survive. What starts out as a solid if unremarkable family film becomes precipitously worse once the guide and his team are split up. The script is repetitive and most of the humor wont be appreciated by anyone older than 12 but ""Eight Below"" is also a movie that fills many minutes of screen time with suffering animals. The eight dogs (Jack Maya Dewey Shorty Sleepy Grumpy Comet and Blitzen if I remember correctly) are difficult to distinguish and most of their scenes go on way too long as if Marshall were making a PBS documentary instead of family entertainment. The Standoff at the Dead Killer Whale is particularly ridiculous but at least its over quickly ending with a sequence out of ""The Hunt for Red October"" -- except with a leopard seal instead of a nuclear submarine. The human acting is competent with Walker proving once again that hes the thespian equivalent of that likable bar band that gets lucky and sells a couple of million albums. (Paul Walker = Huey Lewis and the News? Paul Walker = Spin Doctors?) Hes kind of like a Keanu Reeves but with maybe 10 more IQ points. Despite the movies structural problems the ""Eight Below"" scribes do adhere to the first rule of Hollywood screenwriting No matter what the situation or how cold the climate (in this case minus 31 degrees in Antarctica) you must find a situation for Walker to frolic around with no shirt and board shorts. Someone cast him in the ""Point Break"" remake pronto. -- Advisory This film contains sudden scares and scenes of animal suffering including a couple of sequences that prolong the agony. Imagine if the hunter who shot Bambis mother hit her in the leg and she slowly hobbled to death.

The cinematography is dazzling. The polar setting wows. The blinding vistas the windswept ridges the strange rococo architectures built from snow and shadow -- all spectacular. As for the rest of Eight Below a programmatic Disney tear-jerker about eight Antarctic sled animals and the man who loves them -- well as I said the dogs are gorgeous. Youll care about them. You might even shed a tear for them though youre forgiven if you dont Its no reflection on you your deficits as a human being or your insufficient fondness for pets just the lack of a mindful plot. Basically what we have here is a stranded-animal movie in which the stranded animals are forced to split screen time with a mopey human character and his annoying redundant friends. This makes about as much cinematic sense as remaking Homeward Bound from the pet owners perspective or casting Tom Cruise as the lead in an action flick and then cutting away to scenes of his worried mother. In fairness Eight Below gets off to a thrilling and adventuresome start. The setting is a research base in Antarctica where expedition guide Gerry -- get this -- Shepherd (Paul Walker) learns he has to lead Dr. Davis McClaren (Bruce Greenwood) on a quest for a unique Mercurian meteorite lodged somewhere in the rime along Mount Melbourne. But its late January and the ice is thin and after huffing about the dangers Gerry determines that theyll have to take a sled. Cue the dogs old guy Jack ""best girl"" Maya new boy Max plus Dewey Truman Shadow Shorty and Buck. These intrepid eight pull Gerry and Davis to their destination where Davis finds his hunk of rock and Gerry huffs some more about the dangers. A massive storm gathers. Davis falls through the ice. The dogs schlep him back only to be stranded when the entire human population evacuates Antarctica. Gerry returns to the United States but cant shake his guilt over the dogs. Days weeks months pass as the animals fend for themselves in the icy underworld. Gerry agonizes. Gerry aches. Gerry his friends say get a grip. All this amounts to too much Gerry. One of the movies disappointments is its failure to flesh out its canine heroes not with anthropomorphic touch-ups but in the natural gradual manner of animals under patient observation. The movie offers this in small doses but too few dogs show distinct personalities; just as were getting a read on one of them it spirits away to check up on moody brooding Gerry. Walker is cute and all and he has glittering blue eyes and all and when hes doing his moody brooding thing in a tricked-out sports coupe I kind of like him. But frankly? When hes co-starring with huskies? I dont give a single flying mush about Paul Walker. Get out of the movie boy. Shoo. Directed by Frank Marshall whose previous exotic stomping grounds include the Andes the Congo and the Moon Eight Below is based loosely on a true story (told first in a 1983 Japanese film Nankyoku Monogatari) but it doesnt bear close scrutiny. And even on its own purely emotional terms the ending fails to satisfy One prominent character is left out in the cold. Either key footage was lopped in edits or screenwriter David DiGilio brazenly ignored the ravenous psychotherapeutic cravings of audiences weaned on Old Yeller. Surely he realized we need catharsis.

If the sniffles followed by full-on breath-catching sobs at a recent preview screening were any indication then the PG tale of a sled-dog team left to face a winter alone in Antarctica can be rough going. And that was the adults. Ill admit Id hoped to use the word ""mush"" to describe ""Eight Below"" directed by Frank Marshall and written by newcomer David DiGilio. But this two-hour saga is hardly sentimental kibble. Call it ""Pawing the Void."" Because it turns out there are many ways for a dog to come snout-to-face with death in that frozen expanse. When geologist Davis McClaren (Bruce Greenwood) arrives at the research outpost hes hoping to discover a meteorite field. In an effort to thwart the competition hes led guide Jerry Shepard (Paul Walker) to believe they would head in the opposite direction from where McClaren really plans to go. All Jerrys scout work is wasted. Hes uncertain of the conditions where he McClaren and his hardworking team of sled dogs will travel. A reading of the MPAA fine print hints at whats to come. ""Eight Below"" is PG ""for some peril and brief mild language."" Apt word ""peril."" Even before the arrival of the storm that will force Jerry to leave behind his beloved team of huskies and malamutes dangers abound. One thing for certain Had the screenwriter given the massive uncuddly leopard seal that tries to keep a whale carcass for himself some subtitled dialogue the movie would have earned a PG-13. Early in their journey Jerry complains that he would not have set out if not for his boss. McClarens chiding retort If it was so unsafe why did he agree to go along? Its one of the films truest exchanges. They survive early disaster thanks to the driven loyalty of the dogs. When the team returns to base camp the dogs yaps are met with more glee than Rudolphs return to the Island of Misfit Toys. The joy is short-lived when theyre forced to abandon the dogs. The story of Jerry getting back to his dogs is necessary yet less compelling than the plight of Maya Max Old Jack Shadow Buck Truman Dewey and Shorty (played by 16 canine performers). When the drama of the dogs gets too real the movie cuts to Jerrys melancholy quest. Yet as unbearable as it often feels we yearn for time with the four-legged cast. One of the last movies Marshall directed was ""Alive"" the story of a rugby team stranded in the Andes when their plane crashes. Eventually the survivors must test the nutritional value of their dead teammates. Maya Max and their pals never go that far. Still if you thought imperiled emperor penguins were heartwrenching beware of these dogs.  1/2 | ""Eight Below"" PG for some peril and brief mild language|2 hours|ADVENTURE|Directed by Frank Marshall; written by David Digilio; photography by Don Burgess; starring Paul Walker Bruce Greenwood Moon Bloodgood Jason Biggs and the dogs |Opens today at area theaters.

"More than a mushy dog tale Eight Below is a true love story - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW More than a mushy dog tale Eight Below is a true love story By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  February 17 2006 The 16 or so huskies playing the eight sled dogs in Disneys umpteenth animal adventure Eight Below"" do Oscar-caliber acting. They race heel attack lick and fall over. And at least one has a mean death scene. At nearly every turn I swear I knew what they were thinking and how they were feeling.Their hunger was my hunger. Their frozen snouts made mine seem cold. I dont think I could tell Maya apart from Jack Shorty Buck Shadow Max Dewey or Truman if my life depended on it. But after seeing them work their tails off in this fuzzy mushy chilly slobbery heart-warmer Id trust them with my life -- were I an injured scientist stuck in the Antarctic as a terrible winter storm approaches of course.Thats the fate awaiting Dr. Davis McClaren (Bruce Greenwood) a geologist whos come to Antarctica in pursuit of a meteorite for a top-secret research purposes. Jerry Shepard (Paul Walker) his survival guide tells him its a dangerous mission (the ice is too thin) but takes him and the dogs anyway. Poor Jack the oldest of Jerrys octet was just about to retire too which makes him the Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon"" of the group.The doctor finds what hes looking for but after falling in a lake he comes down with hypothermia and along with Jerry whose hands are frostbitten has to be flown out of their base to a hospital. This happens just as two massive low-pressure systems"" hit. The entire five-person base crew must evacuate and theres no room in the airlift for the dogs Theyre marooned and Jerry is beside himself with guilt and anger. Or as beside himself as Paul Walker in all his hunkiness can demonstrate. His vast blue eyes though have never seemed so lonesome.Jerry is determined to find a way back to the end of the Earth to save his dogs or at the very least pay his respects. Despite the fact that Eight Below"" is based in part on a more grueling 1983 Japanese movie called Antarctica"" its being a Disney movie fills you with hope that this will all work out that Jerry will convince someone to fund a trip back that the dogs will keep finding ways to fend for themselves (mmm dead killer whale). But for most of the film possibilities for a reunion dont look good. The movie counts the time the dogs survive on their own. Four days turn into 15 which swell into more upsetting numbers.Veteran Hollywood producer Frank Marshall directed Eight Below"" which is actually like a family-friendly version of Alive"" Marshalls 1993 film about rugby players who find some unsavory survival techniques after their plane crashes in the Andes. But no matter how slim the pickings get for our sled dogs they dont turn each other into supper. The dogs are more resourceful than that. My favorite example is when they steal the lunch of a vicious sea lion.Jerry meanwhile pleads his case across America hoping against hope that he can make it back to Antarctica. And gradually Eight Below"" turns into more than a mere cornball family picture.Its the most touching love story about tragically separated sexy beasts since Cold Mountain.""

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Eight Below is a sled-dog tale that enduresBy Claudia Puig USA TODAY Eight Below is an engaging adventure saga for family audiences that is more along the lines of the captivating March of the Penguins than the sodden Snow Dogs. When the outdoorsman/guide (Paul Walker) gets words that a snowstorm is approaching he must leave his dogs behind. Walt Disney Pictures The story of the endurance of a pack of hardy sled dogs easily brings a lump to the throat of dog lovers -- and in the interest of full disclosure I must admit to a weakness for movies with canines that are triumphing in the face of adversity. The tale of eight huskies and malamutes left stranded in Antarctica and the man who was determined to rescue them Jerry Shepard (Paul Walker) is loosely based on a true story. Shepard is an outdoorsman who ferries scientists to remote corners of Antarctica with his pack of well-trained dogs. He is assigned to accompany a professor (Bruce Greenwood) who has traveled across the globe from UCLA to the icy continent to research meteorites. Peril ensues the dogs respond with bravery and the pair narrowly escape with their lives. Then the expedition is called back to base camp because of a brewing early winter storm. All the hardy adventurers in Antarctica must evacuate quickly before becoming snowed in. But only one helicopter is available and it cant accommodate the professors heavy gear and the weight of the dogs. The professor Shepard a cartographer (Jason Biggs seemingly on hand only for comic relief) and the helicopter pilot (Moon Bloodgood) who is Shepards love interest board the craft and leave. The plan is to return for the pooches. But when the weather makes that impossible a guilt-ridden Shepard returns to the USA. About the movie Eight Below    (out of four) Stars Paul Walker Bruce Greenwood Jason Biggs Moon Bloodgood Director Frank Marshall Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating PG for some peril and brief mild language Running time 2 hours Opens Friday nationwide He spends months trying to find the resources to return and rescue the dogs he loves who were left chained outside in the cold. Fortunately these are not your everyday hounds. They band together like a pack of wolves and hunt sea gulls to survive. Walker is adorable but gives a one-note performance. Greenwood a charismatic and unsung character actor has the most noteworthy human performance as a somewhat arrogant academic whose decency keeps him from becoming a stock villain in a formulaic story. But the human performances are eclipsed by the four-footed ones. And intentionally so. Though it has plenty of moments of predictability Eight Below also has its surprises. Its an engrossing film that reminds us of the nobility and grace of mans best friend and of the fierce will to survive in the face of the harshest of odds.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor February 17 2006 Save for later Saved Eight Below"" is mostly set in Antarctica where 30 below is more like it. But the title is a pun The eight in question refers to a team of sled dogs left behind by a research team that is forced to evacuate because of an oncoming storm.These dogs shot in loving close-up have names. Theres Grumpy and Sneezy - no wait a minute. Theres Maya Max Shorty Dewey Truman Shadow Buck and Old Jack. In some cases they have more personality than the humans in this movie and their dialogue I mean their woofs is often more eloquent.We can be thankful at least that the director Frank Marshall didnt go all anthropomorphic on us. For all their star quality these dogs remain dogs not furry humans. So far as I can judge no computer effects were used to enhance their dogginess although an attack scene features a glaringly animatronic-looking leopard seal. The sudden appearance of this monster emerging from the decaying carcass of a beached whale is horrific and is likely to frighten small children. It certainly frightened this large adult. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""Eight Below"" is ""inspired by a true story"" although most of the inspiration seems to have arrived second hand Its source is the 1983 Japanese movie ""Nanyoku Monogatari"" - which I have not seen - about a team of skilled sled dogs who against all odds survive the frozen wilds. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 The Hollywoodization - or to be more precise the Disneyfication - of this story is not without its pleasures. (Once upon a time the Disney Studios made fine nature documentaries like ""The Living Desert"" that opened up exotic worlds.) Paul Walker who plays survival guide Gerry Shepherd has a Kevin Costner-ish insouciance; it makes sense that he and the dogs get along since he seems part pooch himself. There is never any doubt that he will buck the authorities and return to the research station to rescue the mutts whose struggle to survive takes up a large part of the screen time.In some ways I wish it had taken up all of the screen time. The interaction between the dogs some of whom have beautiful crystalline white coats is far more fascinating than what goes on between the two-legged mammals which is sometimes mushy (pun intended). Jason Biggs from the ""American Pie"" movies is on hand as a goofy cartographer and he might as well have ""Comic Relief"" tattooed on his forehead. Bruce Greenwood he of the granite jaw gives a granitic performance as a research scientist with an Ahab-like quest to find a meteorite in the frozen wilds.An actress named Moon Bloodgood who started out as a hip-hop dancer and Laker Girl before getting into movie and TV work plays a bush pilot and sometime girlfriend of Jerrys. The role is bland but that name is great.The film by the way was shot not in Antarctica but in the much more mundane sounding town of Smithers a high-altitude ski resort in Canada. Presumably the dogs got their own chairlifts. Grade B- Rated PG for some peril and brief mild language.Sex/Nudity None. Violence 6 scenes. Language 2 mild expressions.

Pic which follows eight sled dogs trapped in Antarctica and the humans who try to rescue them is an entertaining story (but less so when bipeds are taking up valuable four-legged screentime). The Disney offering should do reasonable winter biz with better to come as a home-format item. The family adventure ""Eight Below"" is an easy watch thanks to the splendors of frosty scenery and furry canines. Pic which follows eight sled dogs trapped in Antarctica and the humans who try to rescue them is an entertaining story (but less so when bipeds are taking up valuable four-legged screentime). The Disney offering should do reasonable winter biz with better to come as a home-format item. Pic is ""suggested"" by the 1983 Nippon feature ""Nankyoku Monogatari"" (Antarctica) which was in turn inspired by real-life events. The Japanese version was set in 1958 with two human protags and seven out of nine dogs doomed early on. This version is set in the early 90s with a single principal human and a much happier ending for mans best friends. The film shot in Canada Norway and Greenland marks prolific producer Frank Marshalls first bigscreen directorial effort since ""Congo"" (1995); Marshall and his team do a good job suggesting both the majesty and fearsomeness of the Antarctica landscape. And while huskies may not be the most facially expressive of dogs they certainly are among the most handsome; as long as the movie concentrates on the octets against-the-odds survival the film is thoroughly engaging. Jerry (Paul Walker) is a resident guide at the U.S. National Science Research Base in Antarctica. His comic sidekick is cartographer Charlie Cooper (Jason Biggs) and there are still some embers burning in his officially cooled relationship with the sites pilot supplier Katie (Moon Bloodgood). One day she flies in an ambitious Yank academic Davis McClaren (Bruce Greenwood) who hopes to be the first to find fragments of meteorites from the planet Mercury. Trouble is winter is approaching and the location hes determined to explore is a risky distance away. Jerry reluctantly harnesses up his beloved team of eight sled dogs -- six Siberian huskies and two ""all brawn no brain"" Malamutes -- and does as the cocky prof bids. Their mission is a success despite one particularly scary moment but during their return a massive storm descends. Men and dogs barely make it back through the blizzard and when they reach the base they discover everyone must be evacuated by air immediately. Theres no room on-board for the hounds but Katie promises Jerry shell fly back to get them as soon as the humans are dropped off in New Zealand. Unfortunately weather conditions prevent that from happening. With winters premature start the dogs -- chained together so they wont run away -- are stranded for the season almost certain to die of exposure and hunger. With no way of knowing their fate Jerry roams the globe trying to drum up funds for an emergency rescue operation. Meanwhile the dogs have broken free of their constraints and learn to survive by themselves. Periodic titles report how long theyve been left alone with more than six months passing before help finally arrives. The films full two hours can be felt in the scenes dealing with human characters who get way too much screentime in pics long midsection. Walkers Jerry is a bit bland and Jerrys feelings for the dogs in his charge -- or for Katie for that matter -- never feel like more than a necessary script conceit. Other cast members make competent but undistinguished contribs excepting Biggs likeable turn. The few post-prod f/x (a ""Jurassic Park""-looking vicious leopard seal an aurora borealis lightshow) tend to stick out like sore thumbs. Otherwise all tech aspects are high-grade; Mark Ishams atypically conventional rousing orchestral score is a significant plus.
