Comments Baby Boy Like John Singletons other features this is far from flawless; at 129 minutes its longer than it needs to be and the music hits you like a sledgehammer at moments when any music at all is redundant and something of an insult. But the characters are so full-bodied and the feelings so raw and complex that Id call this the best thing hes done to date--by which I mean the most convincing and serious telling us at least as much about everyday life in South Central Los Angeles as did Boyz N the Hood his first movie. The title character well played by Tyrese Gibson is a 20-year-old with a pronounced Oedipus complex who lives with his 36-year-old mother (A.J. Johnson) has fathered two kids with separate girlfriends (Taraji P. Henson and Tamara LaSeon Bass) and starts to feel crowded when his mother falls for a reformed gangster (Ving Rhames also especially good). Sexually explicit both visually and aurally this shows rare inventiveness in exploring one characters fantasies during an orgasm. With Omar Gooding and Snoop Dogg.

Driven more by social than artistic impulses pic can be taken to task for its overt point-making and late-on dramatic contrivances. But the characters are vibrant and the issues of black male responsibility fatherless kids lack of role models and single mothers are dealt with intimately. A pungently argued civics lesson about the Peter Pan syndrome among contemporary young black men ""Baby Boy"" marks John Singletons return to South Central a decade after his breakthrough debut feature ""Boyz N the Hood."" Driven more by social than artistic impulses pic can be taken to task for its overt point-making lackluster style and some late-on dramatic contrivances seemingly dragged in to provide a little violence. But the characters are vibrant and the motivating issues of black male responsibility fatherless kids lack of role models and single mothers are dealt with intimately unblinkingly and mostly with humor rather than preachiness. On its own merits film should play reasonably well with black audiences and presents a measure of crossover interest due to Singletons name. But the way the film is being quietly slipped into release with no fanfare amid the summer blockbusters suggests that this is another serious film like ""The Tailor of Panama"" earlier in the year that Sony has no idea what to do with which doesnt bode well commercially. Singleton penned the script to ""Baby Boy"" several years ago specifically to star the late Tupac Shakur who appeared in the directors ""Poetic Justice."" Appearing now as a sort of third panel in the filmmakers examination of inner-city Los Angeles life the picture takes a microcosmic look at the same problems addressed on the macrocosmic plane by the Million Man March. However widespread symbolic and universal the situations may be everything on view here is personal and specific; there is no outside world no depiction or discussion of racism no white people or other ethnic groups at all just the community and the dynamics within it. Films tone is not angry or righteous but rather deeply concerned involved and caring. Scripts thesis-oriented nature is established at the outset by a view of a grown fellow as a fetus in the womb accompanied by commentary positing how the black male doesnt enter into adulthood as ""a fully-formed human being"" who can live up to his potential. Man in question is Jody (singer and fashion model Tyrese Gibson) who lives with his mother doesnt work and at the age of 20 has already fathered two kids by two different women. With very good looks and a certain amount of street charm Jody is accustomed to having his way with his women expecting food and sex on demand. In his own mind hes a caring father but he puts in little time and shoulders no real responsibility other than chauffeuring his main woman Yvette (Taraji P. Henson) with whom he has a young son back and forth to work in exchange for unlimited use of her car. As for his other kid a very young daughter the mother in question Peanut (Tamara LaSeon Bass) seems to be moving on quickly seeing clearly that she should expect little from Daddy. Jodys status quo is suddenly threatened by the appearance of a new man in his mothers life. Mom (A.J. Johnson) is a vivacious and blunt live wire whos into gardening and reigniting her private life. She does the latter courtesy of Melvin (Ving Rhames) a bulging tattoo-covered O.G. (original gangsta) now gone straight. For every possible reason -- Melvins air of condescending superiority his heavy intimidation factor his pimplike wardrobe his predilection for preparing breakfast in the nude -- Jody dislikes and resents the older man but most of all is afraid that his mother will use her new relationship as an excuse to kick him out of the house. Hes also fearful of history repeating itself; his older brother was killed on the streets after leaving the house when Mom took up with a previous thug. Instead Jody responds to the situation by announcing ""Today I begin a new life."" From his point of view hes getting on track at last by making some money; in reality hes becoming a hustler of stolen goods selling womens clothes slipped to him by some buddies in the fashion district. Jody tries to enlist his closest friend Sweetpea (Omar Gooding) in the operation but Sweetpea is even more directionless than he is and needful of more extreme solutions to jumpstart his life. But Jodys personal life mutates from messy to miserable. Much of ""Baby Boy"" consists of disagreements recriminations huge fights and invariably lustful reconciliations between Jody and Yvette whose relationship is further troubled by the brazen advances on Jody by a woman in Yvettes office. Matters become worse -- for the characters as well as for the film -- when a certifiable gangsta Rodney (Snoop Dogg) from Yvettes past is released from prison lands on Yvettes couch and refuses to budge. From Rodney emanates the sort of stock standard-issue urban-world melodrama the film otherwise avoids -- the unexamined hoodlum attitude hangin with a crew the ever-escalating threat of violence and the sense of inevitable tragedy down the line -- and matters arent entirely helped by Snoop Dogg himself whose celebrity status and surprising awkwardness at simple screen movement throws the balance of the film off. But just as the storys diverse conflicts seem to be leading toward dire consequences for all (indeed Singleton even offers a negative visual outcome before revealing it as nightmare/fantasy) a hopeful strain emerges that may soften the films contours but are frankly just as realistic and honest as the more caustic and pessimistic tone usually adopted in tales of the ghetto. Placed alongside ""Boyz N the Hood"" the film is just as urgent but more benign and upbeat as it suggests that not only the problems but the solutions are all to be found within the community and the people that inhabit it. Although the characters are sculpted to represent different ""elements"" of the neighborhood Singletons writing is skillful enough to make them come engagingly to life. Gibsons Jody initially rather sullen and sulky is eventually shaken by circumstances and charged emotions into full expressiveness; more will certainly be heard from this young thesp. With the benefit of some sassy straight-talk dialogue Johnson socks over her role as the young mom who has long since stopped caring if her son can hear her getting it on in the next room. Henson shows impressive emotional range as the beleaguered young mother who loves Jody but cant possibly know if hell remain in her life and Gooding (the younger brother of ""Boyz"" star Cuba Jr.) acquits himself as best he can as a man who has yet to define himself. The estimable Rhames has the lions share of Singletons lectures to deliver but the actor makes the medicine go down as smoothly as humanly possible by virtue of his authority and the massive humor he brings to the role. His baleful stare upon hearing Jody talk about him behind his back is priceless and the borderline self-mocking manner in which he delivers even his most pregnant pronouncements simply furthers the giddy fun established by his au naturel kitchen technique and vigorous romps with Mom. Singletons technique and cinematic vocabulary remain as rudimentary as before and pics look is undistinguished. Soundtrack purposefully combines and contrasts hip-hop and Ramp;B.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Jobless and pleasure-seeking with two young children by two different women he cant focus on anything but the next moment. The movie is lurching and repetitive yet Singleton creates such an intricate and painful sense of whats going on inside Jody that his haphazard days have more fullness more life than most movie characters tidy arcs. Gibson gives a broodingly responsive performance as a young man who refuses to grow up because it would mean hed have to stop fighting himself.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Baby Boy Walk Like a Man By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Wednesday June 27 2001 Tyrese Gibson right and Ving Rhames are two of the stars of ""Baby Boy."" (Columbia) John Singleton must believe the truth will set him free for he tells it uncompromisingly in ""Baby Boy."" You may or may not like what you see but there it is indisputably right in your face. The nominal subject of this new film by Singleton the director of ""Boyz N the Hood"" is the infantilization of the African American male the tendency of young men of the community to remain in the films own tough terms ""undeveloped"" living with a parent earning no money having no job fleeing responsibility denying blame just partying and sleeping the years away. They have left the womb only in the technical sense. The movie in what struck me as an attempt to provide a theoretical framework that it otherwise leaves undramatized instructs us in a neat little voice-over that the cause of this distressing phenomenon is racism. Young men born into a society that devalues them at every turn it says inevitably become such perplexing specimens as Jody (Tyrese Gibson) the hero/antihero of ""Baby Boy."" But in fact the film never does attribute this mentality to racism; no white people are glimpsed and theres no sense of an overarching majority culture that systematically suppresses young men. And it doesnt acknowledge another powerful truth which is that millions upon millions of black males arent baby boys at all; theyre true men with healthy committed caring lives.Nevertheless Singleton shows us something life as it must be lived on pitiless streets and in small bungalows in Compton and elsewhere characterized by family incoherence hair-trigger emotions and an anger that rots the soul. Singleton knows this world and brings it to instant believable life. Jody is a man-child in an unpromised land handsome charming willful with women beloved by men but hopelessly crippled.He cannot seem to hold a job possibly because theres no crushing need to. He is the father of two children by two young women neither of whom he lives with or supports. He lives in his mothers home though Singletons evocation of this relationship is both funny and tragic Mama (played brilliantly by Adrienne-Joi Johnson) hardly seems his parent. She could as easily be his date. In her mid-thirties shes a beautiful woman who still has her emotional and physical needs. Shes not about to give up her life for his which precipitates a crisis in Jodys life.Jodys mama has a boyfriend. His name is Melvin and he and Jody face each other across the gulf of generations each distrustful fearful resentful of the other. Melvins sudden presence in the house with his mannish domination of space his sense of entitlement his rough tough humor his bad reputation (10 years in Folsom on a homicide charge) his bulked-up body completely unsettles Jody and the fact that Melvin is played with furious intensity by the superb Ving Rhames adds to the disturbance in the air.And when Jody is upset his whole little empire is upset. That includes his relationship with his girlfriend -- also his babys mama -- Yvette (Washingtonian Taraji P. Henson in a brilliant turn) who yearns for him to commit in a meaningful way. Then theres Peanut his other babys mama of whom he seems well enough quit but who clearly still yearns for him even if the baleful glare of her formidable mother is enough to wither any mans loins.Basically the narrative of ""Baby Boy"" encompasses Jodys attempts to sort out whats important whats not. The movie takes him through a number of incendiary confrontations most of them involving a key issue his control of his emotions.Jody is just used to acting out. He cant seem to say no to any part of his being from his heart to his penis. Thus he acts frequently against his own best interest and certainly without a long-term plan. He needs to grow up and the strength of the film is that Singleton even while admiring so many of Jodys attractive qualities does not flinch from his tough-love appraisal.Alas toward the end the movie veers toward the violent melodrama of ""Boyz N the Hood"" by introducing a mangy competitor for Yvettes fair hand in the form of an ex-convict named Rodney (Snoop Dogg) whom the movie demonizes in ways that I found uncomfortable. The guns come out blood is spilled over nothing and life goes on. Thats the way it is Singleton seems to be saying; deal with it.But despite his last-minute surrender to formula he sees a possible future for the Baby Boys of America a day when they face themselves and learn how to be men. ""Baby Boy"" (110 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for sexual imagery violence and extreme profanity.

"USATODAY.com - A Baby Boy for Singleton to be proud of Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/27/2001 - Updated 0831 AM ET A Baby Boy for Singleton to be proud of By Mike Clark USA TODAY Baby Boy (out of four) Stars Tyrese Gibson A.J. Johnson Taraji P. Henson Ving Rhames Director John Singleton Distributor Columbia Pictures Rating R for strong sexuality language violence and some drug use In Baby Boy writer/director John Singleton returns after 10 years to the same Los Angeles setting of Boyz N the Hood with sometimes messy but always invigorating results. In fact South Central has started to do for Singleton what Baltimore has done for Diners Barry Levinson. This is an easy movie to pick apart but it lives breathes and switches moods from humor to despair better than any American release this year. Singletons casting also is exceptional (just as it was in Hood) starting with model/Ramp;B crooner/MTV VJ Tyrese Gibson as a 20-year-old who cant motivate himself to cut the cord and leave home. And this is despite his having fathered children by two different women. Singleton immediately sends a signal that hes going to be tough on the central figure who veers from being a sometimes sympathetic character to a continuous source of exasperation. Gibsons Jody character takes a stab at working but the womens clothing business he briefly entertains is half-baked both in its choice of apparel and marketing techniques. This leaves him sponging off not just his mother (A.J. Johnson) but his preferred girlfriend (equally splendid Taraji P. Henson) using her car when hes not reduced to commuting on a bicycle one of the movies many unexpectedly hilarious takes. At 36 Moms a buff looker even if the number of cigarettes she consumes is alarming. In search of stability she has a new live-in (Ving Rhames) who has a yard-care business and a lunchbox to tote. But hes also a reformed something-or-other whose previous line of work was obviously not too savory. Rhames intimidating stare battles it out with his equally notable biceps to dominate the screen as his character dominates the digs. Unamused the new king of the household doesnt regard this ""boy"" as any baby though ""petulant child"" wouldnt be too far off the mark. The characters are drawn with such warts-and-all depth that its likely many viewers will be switching emotional allegiances. This hasnt happened in many films so far this year and its a virtue that compensates a lot for Babys overlength and tendency to reiterate points. Singleton is an unflashy even old-fashioned director in the way he allows story and actors to carry the action. Everything you take from this movie is in plain sight and usually straight down the middle; only occasionally does there seem to be anything studied about it. With Baby Boy the filmmaker seems reinvigorated with his material his closest look at urban L.A. since his directorial debut. Last years Shaft was fun but for the first time since Hood Singleton is really sailing.

Photo HANDOUT On the hard road from Boy to man / Singleton back in hood in intense drama 1 / 1 Back to Gallery BABY BOY Tragicomedy. Starring Tyrese Gibson Taraji P. Henson Omar Gooding Ving Rhames and Snoop Dogg. Written produced and directed by John Singleton. (R. At Bay Area theaters. 122 minutes.) ""Shaft"" director John Singleton makes a U-turn away from that glossy entertainment and returns to the heart of his home turf in South Central Los Angeles. His new film ""Baby Boy"" opens with a startling dreamlike image of a naked grown man in a fetal position in the womb. It isnt subtle but its effective. From there Singleton builds a single-minded compelling cautionary tale of young African American men who will not grow up. Call it ""Boyz N the Womb."" Jody (Tyrese Gibson) is 20 years old and already the father of two children with different women. Jobless still wearing low-slung trousers like a teenager and playing with model automobiles when he cant borrow his girls car he is called selfish by every woman in his life. He still lives at home with his mama. His main woman -- apart from his mother -- is Yvette (Taraji P. Henson). Their relationship is the definition of love-hate. In ""Baby Boy"" Jody and Yvette function together at only two levels -- high- decibel arguing and heavy-duty lovemaking. At key moments each of them also sees flashes of his or her future. It will be their salvation and also this films. Singletons tone of intense elevated realism takes off at these moments. Without them ""Baby Boy"" runs the risk of being a harangue. Its got welcome distancing elements of comedy too when the audience laughs not inappropriately at these characters. ""Baby Boy"" can be tough going very tough going but the cast is built to take it. Ving Rhames could not be improved upon as the ex-con Melvin a killer with two strikes against him desperately trying to avoid the third. He enters the life of Jodys mother and is his rival for her love. Jody suspiciously checks him out as well he might. Melvins muscles reveal years of prison workouts and theyre not just for show. Rhames gives the character an assured amused smile but he can strike like a bolt out of the blue. He and Jodys mother played confidently and with spirit by A.J. Johnson (""High Freakquency"") are just about the only two characters with a sense of humor about themselves and any grasp of the big picture. Johnson looks young enough to be another of Jodys girlfriends -- his mother was 16 when he was born. Melvin who obviously hit the books as well as pumping iron in prison comments on the oedipal relationship. It is also one of the false notes when ""Baby Boy"" strays too obviously into polemics. Singleton (""Boyz N the Hood"") is entitled. This is not Jerry Springer exploitation followed by simplistic moralizing though some will be bothered by the stridency and raw language. This is social criticism from someone who has been there and knows what hes talking about. For others though like me it would have been enough that Singleton raise these difficult questions without trying to wrap them up too in the last five minutes. The spirit of Tupac Shakur hovers over Jody literally and figuratively. A huge mural of the rap star who died of gunshot wounds in 1996 at the age of 25 dominates Jodys room. Interestingly nobody ever mentions that mural but Tupacs baleful glance studies everything that happens in the room. Singleton had this film in mind for a long time and planned to have Tupac take the role. Another rap star Snoop Dogg makes every moment count as a convict who first calls Yvette collect from prison and then shows up ominously on her doorstep. Jody tries to sell boosted clothing to women to make something of himself. He sweet-talks the women -- hes selling a line all right but its not a line of clothing. Jody is almost presented as the sex machine Singleton was prevented from making of Samuel L. Jackson in ""Shaft"" but the young man here is given a brief moment of self-justification. He expects to die young like his brother (and like the figure in the mural). The children are something of him to leave behind. Henson as Yvette can go from ""I hate you"" to ""I love you"" in a flash and make it work both ways. Jody and Yvette have a pattern of fighting and making up spectacularly shown in one quick cut. During a bout of lovemaking Yvette fantasizes in succession getting pregnant again a wedding Jody in prison and his funeral. She isnt the only one who will visualize him dead. Omar Gooding (Cuba Gooding Jr.s brother) is Jodies homey who seems similarly fated. When they give comeuppance to five punks who jump Jody the humor of the situation turns grave as what lies ahead for Jody plays across his face. As Jody actor and recording artist Gibson must carry long stretches of this movie. Dont sell him short because hes also a fashion model. His bearing is part of Jodys character and helps make him what he is. Advisory Contains vulgarity and epithets nudity explicit sex and violence.
