Comments The Original Kings of Comedy This record of one stop on the ""Kings of Comedy"" tour focuses on the audience at the Charlotte Coliseum on February 26 and 27 2000 as emphatically as it focuses on the performers--comedians Steve Harvey D.L. Hughley Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac. Footage shot from over their shoulders reveals a sea of faces out of which individuals quickly emerge as the comedians--especially emcee Harvey--enthrall and provoke audience members several of whom are singled out as objects of mockery in a way that also demonstrates deep respect. Harvey and his fellow performers may not be able to see everything beyond the footlights but what they say and do onstage is motivated by an awareness that performing is at its heart interactive an awareness director Spike Lee shares. With the help of cinematographer Malik Sayeed and editor Barry Alexander Brown who establish distinct visual modes for the presentation of each act Lee performs magic. Hes preserved and expanded the experience of an adrenaline-pumping uproarious night of racism- classism- and sexism-subverting humor by showing the perspectives of everyone there including the four other magicians onstage. 117 min.

True to its title ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" is a consistently hilarious assemblage of highlights from the hit concert tour of the same name by comedians Steve Harvey D.L.

In this third docu outing for Spike Lee (and second concert film following the 1998 HBO presentation of John Leguizamos ""Freak"") helmer deftly condenses the performances into a lightning-quick two-hour package. Theatrical release rescues the long-dormant comedy concert genre from cable oblivion; Lees name along with recognition of the tour itself and its four topliners should attract the attention of urban and suburban moviegoers seeking a respite from the barrage of less-than-thrilling summer action movies and unfunny comedies. Aided by the fluid cutting of editor Barry Alexander Brown and the funky grooves of music supervisor Alex Steyermark -longtime collaborators both -- Lee expertly accomplishes perhaps the most crucial task in any concert film He conveys a palpable sense of the rousing communal energy of the live performance itself. Watching ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" you feel as if youre in the front row of the Charlotte Coliseum and not merely watching a filmed record of a bygone show. Lees film is vital and alive and watching it becomes a richly cinematic experience unto itself. But Lee also knows where his bread is buttered and so he primarily concerns himself with the technical exercise of capturing the four performers routines in as unobtrusive a manner as possible letting the comic material and its inspired delivery serve as the main attraction. As on tour pic presents each comics set uninterrupted with emcee Harveys monologue broken into three parts that serve as intros for the other performers; with the exception of a few fleeting backstage glimpses between the various segments the film is straight-ahead jokes with a very high laugh quotient. Working with such time-tested standup fodder as pop culture the workplace child rearing and the aging process the four Kings set their material ablaze with rapid-fire delivery and a take-no-prisoners attitude. Like Pryor Murphy and Redd Foxx before them they are all exceptionally keen on the delicate balance of race relations in America and assured enough onstage to make potentially incendiary statements as a way of satirizing the contemporary climate of political correctness. Yet one of the films greatest pleasures is the enormous diversity of personality and style represented by the featured comic quartet. Moreover pic allows all four performers to reinvent themselves beyond their familiar television and movie appearances. Harveys role as host is itself a bit of a comic riff on his long-running weekly gig on the ""Its Showtime at the Apollo"" television series while viewers who know him better from his own self-titled show on the WB may be surprised by the raunchiness and explicit language of his stage routine. Cedric the Entertainer -- who regularly plays Ed Norton to Harveys Ralph Kramden on Harveys sitcom -- more than comes into his own here with the sweetly funny demeanor and raucous song-and-dance routines that have made him a star of the black comedy club circuit. Hughley who also stars in a self-titled family-friendly sitcom has by far the most fiery Pryor-esque demeanor of the four and does some electrifying spot-on improv with members of the audience. But the concerts true showstopper is Bernie Mac (""Life"" ""Whos the Man""). Appearing onscreen last he extends his motor-mouthed bug-eyed movie persona into a dizzying string of impeccably timed comic arpeggios worthy of regal pronouncement. Tech specs are more than adequate as docus go with Lees choice lenser-of-late Malik Sayeed admirably augmenting existing venue lighting to create a consistent look across multiple shooting cameras.

Hughley and Steve Harvey crack wise - and cuss up a storm - in ""The Original Kings of Comedy."" (Paramount Pictures) Lets clear up one thing right off the bat ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" is not - I repeat not - a re-release of a dark and disturbing 1983 film by Martin Scorsese about a pair of dorky misfits obsessed with a talk-show host. For one thing these Kings are a heck of a lot funnier - not to mention more profane - than Robert De Niro and Sandra Bernhard ever were. In 1997 producer Walter Latham rounded up three fairly well-known-but-far-from-household stand-up comedy names (Steve Harvey Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac). Organizing a concert tour (joined a year later by funnyman D.L. Hughley) Latham billed the four as the ""Kings of Comedy"" and the quartet of self-described ""old school"" comedians soon began routinely selling out several-thousand-seat coliseums. This documentary shot on digital video by director Spike Lee at a Charlotte N.C. appearance is his record of the tour for posterity. All told the ""Kings"" tour has grossed 37 million to date. Not bad for a handful of guys none of whom is Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock standing on a stage cracking jokes. My only regret is that I cant repeat most of them. Suffice it to say that all sacred cows (and a few sacred sheep) are butchered by these blisteringly hilarious and foul-mouthed comics white folks black folks cops criminals rappers Ramp;B singers men women (naturally) gays straights old folks and babies. Not even Luther Vandrosss ""not quite right"" hair is safe from mockery courtesy of show-stopper Cedric the Entertainer. Hes easily the best thing about ""Kings"" especially when the dapper and roly-poly clown launches into an inspired parody of break dancing or when he delivers one of his wry nuggets inspired by the flotsam of pop culture. But God help the man who has the misfortune of sitting in the front row during one of emcee Harveys riffs on audience members hair clothing teeth and eyewear (some of the films biggest laughs come as Lee cuts from the stage to shots of poor unwitting concertgoers). Harvey whos not exactly known as an insult comic emcees the proceedings with quick-witted aplomb a genial smile and a barbed tongue. Hes at his best when mocking the crowd with the skilled brutality of a surgeon particularly one hapless ""computer technology student"" who looks to his skeptical host more like a player than a programmer (yeah right says Harvey ""you cant even spell computer technology""). After drawing the comedians withering attention by daring to walk out before intermission the poor man undergoes further abuse when he returns to his seat to find the expensive jacket hes left on his seat has been incorporated into the act and is being held up to ridicule. The guys reaction to being made to play the fool? Not anger but praise for his tormentor. ""You the man"" he tells Harvey. Talk about the Stockholm Syndrome. If you only know these guys from broadcast TV - in addition to Cedric who appears on Harveys WB sitcom Hughley has a show moving to UPN this fall after airing on ABC last year while Mac has appeared on ""Moesha"" and ""The Wayans Brothers"" - youll be startled by some of the foul language and disregard of societal taboos that are evident in the less censored environment of the concert stage. Fans of HBOs ""Def Comedy Jam"" and other no-holds-barred cable shows where some of these jokers have appeared wont even flinch though at such bits as Hughleys observations about dirty underwear (dont ask) or Macs trademark pop-eyed tirades about his own sexual inadequacy not to mention his peroration on the many uses of the f-word. Judging by the ages of the audience (many of whom appear to be in their forties and fifties) and the comics themselves (age 35 to 43) and by the fact that the youth of today bear the brunt of the onstage abuse the term ""old school"" here has double meaning. Dont worry though Theres nothing stodgy about these court jesters or their humor even though their act is a decidedly grown-up affair. THE ORIGINAL KINGS OF COMEDY (R 100 minutes) - Contains a steady stream of blue humor.

Hughley Cedric the Entertainer Bernie Mac. Directed by Spike Lee. 120 minutes. Several theaters. ""R"" - Restricted because of language and topics. --------------------------- At first glance the notion of Spike Lee directing a concert film seems absurd. A concert film? Stick the camera center-stage and walk away thats your concert film. Attempts to be more innovative - such as Robert Townsends direction of Eddie Murphys ""Raw"" - usually fall flat. Invariably Townsend panned out at exactly the wrong moment. Spike Lee does not stick the camera center-stage and walk away and he does not pan out at the wrong moment. In fact ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" with its 10 cameras and backstage footage may be the most innovatively directed stand-up concert film ever made. The tour itself ""The Kings of Comedy"" began in 1997 when producer Walter Latham decided to package some of the best comedians in the country and play the big arenas rather than the smaller clubs. The tour was a success but its size necessitated playing only major markets which is why according to the press kit Latham decided to put it on film. ""I felt that if we documented it . . . "" he says ""I could take it to Jackson Miss. Montgomery Ala. places that I couldnt normally take the tour."" Lee adds ""Its the best comedy tour ever but its been under the radar."" Under the radar. In other words most white people hadnt known about it - including myself. Of the four comedians involved - Steve Harvey D.L. Hughley Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac - I had only heard of the first two Hughley from his CBS (now UPN) sitcom ""The Hughleys"" where he always seemed more intelligent than his bland sitcomish surroundings and Harvey from the WB networks ""The Steve Harvey Show"" which if it left any impression at all was negative. These guys? I thought. These guys are supposed to be funny? Turns out they are. Very. Harvey is the host the man who does his shtick while introducing the other comedians. Before a Charlotte N.C. crowd he raises the issue of Rae Carruth the Carolina Panthers wide receiver arrested last December for conspiring to kill his girlfriend. Raw stuff but Harvey makes it funny wondering about the intelligence of Carruth who on the lam fled not to Canada or Mexico but Nashville. Each comedian has his own distinct personality. Hughley is rapid-fire. Cedric is a master mime who does a great riff on white peoples love of space movies. Bernie Mac is less constantly funny than the others and more likely to make the audience uncomfortable. Overall with each comedian there may be a little too much ""white folks like this/black folks like this"" humor as well. But no matter whos on stage theres another performer present and thats the mostly African-American crowd. The majority of concert films if they show the audience at all show an occasional reaction shot of people laughing but Lee revels in his audience even as the audience revels in the performance. This wouldnt have worked with most white crowds who tend to be more sedate and less participatory than black crowds and its probably among the reasons Lee chose this project. From ""Do The Right Thing"" to ""Get On The Bus"" Lee has depicted the African-American community as it has not been in the larger white culture and ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" continues this tradition. Given that this is only a concert film the palpable sense of community you get is truly astounding. Somehow Lee manages to suggest not only community but divisions within that community. There are absurdities but there is love despite - perhaps even because of - those absurdities. At one point Harvey - word for word the funniest of the four - after dismissing hip-hop leads the audience in the ""old school"" songs of Earth Wind amp; Fire and Lenny Williams. You get a greater sense of love in this one scene than in almost every romantic comedy coming out of Hollywood. Copyright (c) 2000 Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved.

Hughley Bernie Mac; Director Spike Lee; Producer (group) 40 Acres amp; a Mule Filmworks; Release Date Wide 08/18/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 115; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted August 18 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT Great stand-up comedians do more than bring on the laughter -- they make the air around them crackle with danger and glee. When you watch a monologue by Richard Pryor Sam Kinison Eddie Murphy or Bill Maher in his recent brilliant HBO special Be More Cynical you feel you know what its like to take in the world through their feelers. The routines are charged even between jokes with anticipatory hilarity. The Original Kings of Comedy Spike Lees filmed record of the Kings of Comedy concert tour which has been playing to packed houses (with a variety of line-ups) since 1997 contains an honest handful of sly and hilarious moments like the one in which the rotund deep-voiced Cedric the Entertainer looking like the missing court jester of Run-DMC mimes the way that a neighborhood player turns the simple act of smoking into a performance piece of cool or when the dapper D.L. Hughley discourses on anorexia -- a syndrome he suggests thats the purest expression of white privilege. The film features performances by a quartet of African-American comics most of whom honed their chops on the BET/Def Comedy Jam circuit. In addition to Cedric and Hughley theres Steve Harvey the shows MC a shameless 70s romantic who grooms himself like the suave high school teacher he plays on his sitcom and the theatrically ferocious Bernie Mac who tweaks his own handsomeness by popping his eyes and speaking in a hyperbolic rasp of inner-city rage. All four have their moments yet none of them really comes close to breaking into the comic stratosphere. (Youll probably find Bernie Mac either a showstopper or as I did a one-note attack squad.) The reason I think is that the Kings of Comedy show is so relentlessly obsessed with the different ways that black people and white people experience the world that the jokes ultimately pile up into an orgy of racial generalities. Richard Pryor of course mined this terrain several decades ago but his caricatures of white hypocrisy had a scathing on-target particularity. D.L. Hughley is broadly funny discussing why African Americans dont bungee jump or why they had no patience for Titanic (""The band was playing when the ship went down"" he whines in disbelief) and Cedric the Entertainer does a provocative bit on how whites secretly ""hope"" that things will turn out okay while blacks ""wish"" that life would hand them an excuse to blow their stacks. Most of this stuff is designed to flatter black self-esteem by shoring up the perception of African Americans as tough stylish resilient. The celebration however could have been balanced with a bit more confessional satire. Harvey amid his homage to ""old school"" music does a spot-on send-up of the garbled sound and lockstep solipsism of a hip-hop concert. Its a routine that points to what might have been a much edgier show one that dared to lampoon those very African Americans who have now made it an industry to ""represent.""

Starring Steve Harvey D.L. Hughley Cedric the Entertainer Bernie Mac. Directed by Spike Lee. (R. 94 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" can make a person sick in two ways at once -- through its lowdown raunch and through the spasms of laughter that use stomach muscles one might not have known existed. Director Spike Lees riotous concert film featuring African American comics Steve Harvey D.L. Hughley Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac is likely to be a guilty pleasure for most audiences. It may set a record for use of the expletive that starts with ""mother"" and theres enough material about sex bodily functions and racial differences to offend great numbers of people -- black white or otherwise. ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" makes Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor seem squeaky clean. The films four stars captured during a 1997 national tour that billed them as ""The Kings of Comedy"" go where comics dont often go -- both in words and in physical gestures. Subtlety is not what this film is about. For example Hughley expounds upon the lifelong bathroom habits of black males (you dont want to know). Harvey (""Its Showtime at the Apollo"" ""The Steve Harvey Show"") is the master of ceremonies. Lee filmed performances on- and offstage when the tour stopped at the Charlotte Coliseum in North Carolina. Harveys the tamest and funniest of the quartet and he earns his laughs in a segment discussing how blacks would have dealt with the sinking of the Titanic as opposed to the way whites handled it -- at least as depicted in James Camerons hit movie. Since Lee recorded and greatly amplified the raucous laughter of the audience in the packed Charlotte venue it will be hard to distinguish in a crowded movie house whos laughing harder -- the audience on the films soundtrack or the audience in the theater. A riotous bit by Harvey is his comparison between old-school music the slick romantic stuff deployed to get the love-mood boiling and todays hip-hop which he argues is all about guns and violence. ""Rappers quit singing about love"" he says ruefully. ""Songs used to tell a woman how you felt about it (making love)."" Then Harvey demonstrates that music-as-foreplay idea showing off his cool crooning skills. The guys got real elegance. Cedric the Entertainer does a funny bit about how whites have a ""hope creed"" -- ""they hope things dont go wrong"" in their lives while blacks are fixated on a ""wish creed."" The differences are subtle but Cedric explores the wishes that accompany the fitful realities of everyday life for many African Americans. Bernie Mac (""Life"" ""Players Club"" ""Booty Call"") is the most dramatic of the crew and he pushes the limits. He punctuates his performance with scary-looking wide eyes and he goes whole hog on a bit about keeping unmindful little kids in their places by using bullying and violence. There are moments when he seems to cruise toward uncomfortable seriousness about swatting kids. Its a touchy issue in these days of politically correct parenting ideas. Areas that might offend have to do mostly with racial stereotyping (its a given that races and ethnic groups are hardest on themselves) and of course that old fave gender habits. Much fun is made of women for their alleged obsession with hairdos and sex donts and guys are portrayed as helplessly libidinous. Its surprising that this gross-out film -- which is also very funny -- got an R rating when an NC-17 might have been more appropriate in terms of dirty talk. Wise to keep little kids away but remember It will be out on video one of these days. -- Advisory This movie contains extremely raw language. ..
