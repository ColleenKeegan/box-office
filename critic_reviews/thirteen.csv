On one side resides a solitary Buddhist monk on the other a teenager who beneath her pure Catholic-school-uniform exterior is a well of torment and degradation.Inspired in part by Dantes ""Inferno"" this practically dialogue-free first feature by Yongman Kim relies heavily on sound and music to set the mood which fluctuates from soothing to unnerving and on interesting faces which the films leads fortunately possess.Ivo Velon as Chris the monk who spends each day drawing portraits in Washington Square Park could have carried the movie on his own. And Diana Gitelman as Lotusia the young girl who flees her home only to end up getting paid to engage in the same sort of sadistic acts she witnessed there is convincing as both saint and sinner.Chriss and Lotusias paths constantly threaten to cross (beyond the casual hallway and sidewalk run-in and spying on each other through a peephole in the wall). When it finally seems likely to happen the film crashes to a sudden and unsatisfying conclusion. But this is the first part of a projected trilogy and assuming these characters lives -- or deaths -- will be further explored its really just the beginning.1/3Opens today in Manhattan.

"Honeymoons over | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsHoneymoons overGeorge Clooneys Danny Ocean and crew set sail in a rehash of the first flick for a confusing too-long cruise in Oceans Thirteen.From left George Clooney Elliott Gould and Matt Damon reprise their roles in Oceans 13.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 8 2007 Oceans Thirteen (out of 4)Starring George Clooney Brad Pitt Al Pacino Matt Damon Don Cheadle Ellen Barkin Andy Garcia and Bernie Mac.Directed by Steven Soderbergh.122 minutes. At major theatres. PG Ground zero for the boyish frolics of Oceans Thirteen is a fabulous hotel and casino complex of red glass and steel rising out of Las Vegas like strands of DNA.Called The Bank after its treacherous owner Willy Bank (a desiccated Al Pacino) its a dazzling feat of human ingenuity. Its also completely fake.Much like the movie an exercise in stylish bravado that is as substantial as a catfight between supermodels. If winks were gold and smirks were diamonds Oceans Thirteen would have more booty than Capt. Jacks galleon. Director Steven Soderbergh trifles for a third time with Armani-clad conman Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his code-talking brothers in larceny. But whereas Oceans Twelve attempted novelty by moving from Vegas to Europe Oceans Thirteen lazily settles for a rehash of the main scam of Oceans Eleven.That being to hoodwink the proprietor of a Vegas casino out of his soft-earned money with a drawn-out heist that makes 007 movies seem Spartan by comparison. This time sigh its personal (although Oceans Eleven was too). Vegas mentor Reuben (Elliott Gould) who bankrolled Dannys previous two capers falls prey to the malevolence of erstwhile partner Bank who stabs people in the front so he can watch them suffer. Reuben is left in financial peril and at deaths door from a heart attack.Enter Danny Rusty (Brad Pitt) Linus (Matt Damon) Basher (Don Cheadle) and the rest of Oceans swells - minus the fabulous femmes played by Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones in previous instalments. A single line writes them out ""Its not their fight.""This kind of economy at the outset plus the powerful payback/loyalty motivation could lead the gullible to think that for once an Oceans movie might actually be disciplined. No such luck in this ""bring-you-down town"" as Frank Sinatra croons on the soundtrack his legendary binding handshake also being part of the films Vegas mythos. Soderbergh and screenwriters Brian Koppelman and David Levien are consumed by a Goldbergian impulse to make simple things complex.Elaborate set-ups lead to minor gags. Such as a Mexican side-trip for battling brothers Virgil and Turk (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan). Theyre sent to infiltrate the low-wage factory that makes the dice for The Bank all the better to rig the bones. They end up starting a workers revolution a digression thats about as funny as it sounds. Wouldnt it have been easier to just bribe the pit boss as Danny does a few scenes later?Meanwhile check out the Byzantine break-in planned by techno-geek Basher (Cheadle). He seeks to create an artificial earthquake beneath The Bank to knock out a supposedly infallible security system called Greco. Making the Earth move requires the drilling machines used to dig the Chunnel plus a 36 million loan from Dannys archenemy Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia). The phrase ""it cant be done"" soon becomes tiresome and pointless. I have to grudgingly allow Oceans Thirteen one dubious achievement. If the object of the exercise really is to make things as difficult as possible so as to make Danny and the boys seem all the more clever for breaking The Bank without losing a cufflink then it succeeds handsomely on that score even if it does take forever.Still as Rusty complains so eloquently ""Jeez could you make it any more complicated?""The best jokes in Oceans Thirteen are the simplest ones. Such as when Rusty catches Danny getting teary-eyed over an Oprah segment about a camp for disadvantage children - a gag that gets an even funnier second act right before the credits roll.The movie is lamentably lacking in estrogen despite the presence of Ellen Barkin as Banks rapacious assistant Abigail.The opportunity to rekindle Sea of Love sparks between the reunited Barkin and Pacino is wasted the seduction being left to Matt Damons fumbling Linus.Barkin gets so little screen time and generates so little heat with Damon she should consider suing Soderbergh for coitus interruptus. (At least shes in the movie; her part in Oceans Twelve made only the cutting-room floor.)By my count theres at least three subplots too many in Oceans Thirteen and a good half hour of its 202 running time that could be cut for fun and profit.Im also unsure about the math of the gang members - the poster shows 12 Ocean bros if you include former foe Terry Benedict. Who amongst the crowd of other players is the 13th member exactly?But there I go again looking for a room key in a hotel made of smoke and mirrors.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In Steven Soderberghs Las Vegas gentleman thieves operate by a strict code of rules as tight as snake eyes against the rails. These laws of larceny were laid down in a handshake from Frank Sinatra and sealed with a kiss - a showgirl on one cheek the Mafia on the other. The main rule is that its OK to be rich. Not just OK but in fact preferable to the alternative. You just cant be a rich jerk. Rich jerks get taken down by Danny Oceans Eleven originally now in ""Oceans Thirteen"" and into the future indefinitely until we get to ""Four Score and Oceans."" This isnt a new idea and ""Oceans Thirteen"" suffers a bit from stale presmoking-ban casino air. Andy Garcia was insufferable as Terry Benedict in ""Oceans Eleven"" and now the job falls to Al Pacino channeling Michael Corleone and the scent of Ellen Barkin into a smarmy casino CEO modeled on legendary egomaniac Steve Wynn. Even Soderbergh with his impeccable sense of timing cant direct us past the talkiness of ""Thirteens"" first half. Clooney as Ocean and Brad Pitt as partner Rusty spend long minutes explaining the plot to a new recruit played by Eddie Izzard. Seems that Mean Willy Bank (Pacino) cut beloved mentor Reuben (Elliott Gould) out of their casino partnership on a magnificent new Strip hotel nearly ready to open. Reuben is heartbroken literally because Willy broke the rules and cheated a cheater. Danny and the boys gather at Reubens bedside and vow to break Willys new hotel on opening night with an elaborate scam to cheat every table from craps to slots. ""But the dice are controlled from the manufacturer to the floor"" one reluctant crook complains. ""Which is why we went all the way to the manufacturer"" Danny and Rusty explain. They send Casey Affleck and Scott Caan to load the dice at a Mexican factory where by the way they foment revolution with a Zapata-influenced wage strike. Theres a lot to explain including the last-minute addition of a diamond heist to the main casino action. And more hilarious made-up con-game names from Soderbergh and screenwriters Brian Koppelman and David Levien. Can you get your job back after being fired? That would be ""a Billy Martin."" Letting the big gamblers win to ruin the casino? ""Reverse Big Store."" Creating a false earthquake scare? That would be ""doing an Irwin Allen."" Once Soderbergh gets all his chips in a stack though its all in from there to the end. His scams seem precise even if we can barely understand them and he knows how to give each character in this ever-expanding cast their due - underneath a fake mustache. Everybody gets a bad costume so dont miss Don Cheadle channeling Eddie Murphy while dressed in a star-spangled Evel Knievel jumpsuit. Barkin looks fabulous all purring repression and push-up bras. She pinches a waitress arm and fires her on the spot because her ""body mass index"" is all out of whack - such weight restrictions are legal you see because the crafty Willy hired them as ""models who serve."" Smart little touches like these keep us listening for dialogue even when the rest of the show is as over the top as Cirque de Soleil. Pacino actually shows some restraint giving his lines more bite ""Dont blame yourself"" he tells one hapless minion ""we should have fired you a week ago."" As you watch the Oceans franchise remember that nearly everybody comes back to the roulette wheel for a sequel bet. I didnt catch any Julia Roberts cameos but keep an eye out for everybody else who ever laid down a marker for Soderbergh. Just like being in Vegas itself part of the fun of watching the movie is recognizing somebody who is famous for being in an earlier version of basically the same movie. Some wisecracking critic will no doubt smirk that what was filmed in Vegas should have stayed in Vegas. But another one of those Soderbergh rules to live by is that everything ""Oceans"" is done for fun. If youre not having a good time cash in your chips and walk away. Dont whine to management and dont expect to be comped. In Hollywoods version of Vegas Ill have the surf and the turf and the vegetarian and anything else Soderbergh wants to serve me.

Olivier Dahans phantasmagorical biopic gives us a brilliant performance by Marion Cotillard as the passionate tortured Piaf and Ms. Cotillard gives us something new in a show-business portrait -- a sense of what the song does to the singer. ENLARGE The process reveals itself early in the time-hopping film when Piaf stands on stage to sing her imperishable ""Milord"" a mini-drama that progresses from jaunty to tender to frightening. Its clear that the passage of time has already taken a terrible toll. Frances premiere chanteuse looks empty spent a weary soul waiting for the fix that only music can provide. Then the orchestra starts to play she opens her mouth and a song she has sung countless times restores her to life as it flows through her. Flows through her and then out into the auditorium with the intensity of a cyclotron beam; anyone who has known Piafs voice can recognize it from a single syllable. The film sees her passion as the product of a wretched sickly childhood -- abandoned by her alcoholic parents raised by her grandmother among prostitutes in a brothel. From the age of nine she sang songs for sous on the streets of Paris. (When little Edith lets loose with ""La Marseillaise"" its enough to send bourgeois passersby to the barricades.) As a young woman she had unerring taste in music and disastrous taste in men. At the age of 44 wracked by illness and addiction she looked like a harridan. Before turning 48 she was dead. ""La Vie en Rose"" photographed superbly by Tetsuo Nagata honors Piafs life by refusing to sentimentalize it. The film is long and sometimes harrowing but also enthralling. And the script declines to bother with such events as World War II which slips by unnoticed. It took me a while to realize this wasnt negligence but a reflection of Piafs point of view. Her life was only about singing and searching for love. And always the songs. Oceans Thirteen ENLARGE Matt Damon George Clooney and Brad Pitt in Oceans Thirteen Youve got to hand it to the people who made ""Oceans Thirteen"" -- and youll help hand it to them by buying tickets. The director Steven Soderbergh and his large cheerful cast have managed to make the least possible movie that still resembles a movie as opposed to ""Oceans Twelve"" which resembled nothing more than a ramble through European scenery. This new one has a plot and as in the original Las Vegas scenery. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and their cohorts are back in the Wests best answer to Abu Dhabi because their mentor Reuben (Elliott Gould) has been cheated out of a partnership in a new hotel called The Bank by a ruthless Vegas operator named Willy Bank -- hes played by Al Pacino. To take their revenge Oceans crew decides to sabotage the hotels opening and break The Banks supposedly impregnable bank. In one of the films unmerrier pranks Carl Reiners Saul Bloom impersonates a food critic/cum Michelin-or-Mobil-style inspector while the real ratings guy suffers insults and discomforts that include swarms of bedbugs. Its a reworking of the hilarious episode 4 of ""Fawlty Towers"" but like all of ""Oceans Thirteen"" hilarity-free. SHOWBUSINESS The Road To Broadway There was a time believe it or not when no one outside the movie industry talked about movie budgets. The same goes for Broadway. Theater-goers didnt know or care how much ""The Glass Menagerie"" ""Death of a Salesman"" or ""The Sound of Music"" cost; they cared about the event. Now everything and everyone on Broadway dances to the sound of money. Producing a musical entails immense risk and producing a straight play entails insane risk what with soul-busting budgets tickets at 100-plus and a usually ruinous dependence on opening-night reviews. Yet producers continue to produce and performers continue to perform for a variety of reasons that include unquenchable love of the living stage. Dori Berinsteins fine documentary ""SHOWBUSINESS The Road To Broadway"" evokes this love. The filmmaker clearly stands on the side of artistic aspiration of hope in the face of preposterous odds. Yet she is equally clear about the impediments to success as she tracks four entries in one of Broadways recent destructo-derby seasons. The season is that of 2003-2004. The entries are ""Taboo"" the musical by and about Boy George that Rosie ODonnell produced at huge personal expense and with epic backstage turbulence; ""Avenue Q"" a quirky little show with grown-up puppets and a spiritual debt to ""Sesame Street""; ""Caroline or Change"" the Tony Kushner play with a bravura performance by Tonya Pinkins and ""Wicked"" a 14 million musical about the Wicked Witch Of the West from ""The Wizard of Oz."" With cameras rolling behind the scenes of all four productions ""SHOWBUSINESS"" tracks the eventual winners and losers. The spectacle can be chilling -- so many pitfalls plus some pratfalls plus a ghastly gaggle of theater critics speculating with unseemly glee about which shows will fail or prevail. And a film that properly decries Broadways make-or-break structure buys into the drama of the Tony Awards by which Broadway shows live or die. Along the way though Dori Berinsteins cameras catch gallant theater people doing what theyve done since Sophocles was a pup rehearsing revising worrying learning stretching struggling to bump things up from good to wonderful and constantly fervently hoping.    DVD TIP Edith Piafs voice was inimitable and ""La Vie en Rose"" wisely uses it instead of trying to imitate it. The same strategy was followed in ""The Jolson Story"" but not in ""Lady Sings the Blues"" (1972) a purported biography of Billie Holiday (who was Piafs contemporary) starring Diana Ross. The film directed by Sidney J. Furie misrepresents Billies life while Diana Ross misrepresents her voice but with her own bedazzlement which is why the movie has so many loyal fans.

"Oceans 13 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Oceans 13 reviewed. Oceans 13 reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 7 2007 829 PM Oceans 13 The movie as luxury brand. By Dana Stevens George Clooney Don Cheadle Elliott Gould and Bernie Mac in Oceans 13 In a summer full of ponderous blockbusters (an oddly large percentage of which seem to be the third in a series) Oceans 13 (Warner Bros.) is the first Ive seen that makes the smart choice to downsize from the previous installment. Oceans 12 (2004) dragged its dozen leads from one European location to another in search of an antique document and a Faberge egg pursued by a French superthief and an international cop. Oceans 13 returns the gang to their Vegas home and focuses them on one specific task To bankrupt and humiliate a megalomaniacal tycoon named Willy Bank (Al Pacino) whos about to open an elite hotel after cheating his partner Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) out of his percentage of the profits.Pacino is Bank all right--casting him as the bad guy was worth whatever stratospheric salary he now commands. Resplendent in lavender suspenders and a glowing orange tan hes one of the few actors with both the star power and the gift for self-mockery that this franchise requires. And similar to his marvelous Shylock in The Merchant of Venice (2004) he builds Banks villainy on a firm foundation of pathos. This is a guy with nothing in life but his reputation for running great hotels. So the dashing dozen--financed by their former nemesis Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia)--resolve to destroy Banks new establishment a Gehry-esque Postmodern skyscraper along with his reputation in the hospitality industry.The heist plot departs from the cheerfully ludicrous notion that the disgraced Tishkoff is literally dying of a broken heart--he suffers an infarction after Banks betrayal and refuses to get out of bed thereafter. The guys decide to lift Reubens spirits with the best gift of all the schadenfreude of witnessing your enemys ruin. And if it takes staging an earthquake shutting down a high-security supercomputer sabotaging the visit of a Michelin-style hotel critic (David Paymer) with everything from bedbugs to food poisoning and equipping Matt Damon with a false nose and an aphrodisiac skin implant so he can seduce Banks assistant (a game Ellen Barkin)--well thats what friends are for.Like Greek epic heroes with their identifying epithets each member of the Oceans pantheon has exactly one personality trait which he wields proudly from film to film. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is the suave unflappable capo; Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) the sharply dressed tactician who executes Dannys ideas; Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) the wannabe kid struggling to be taken seriously by the big boys--I could run down the list one by one but there are word counts to be considered here. With a cast this large Soderbergh has to resort too often to devices like multiple screens and long pans across a lineup of faces. Some characters like Bernie Macs sleight-of-hand man and Shaobo Qins contortionist acrobat barely get one scene.The crime plot in Oceans 13 is thoroughly incomprehensible from beginning to end. The bumbling brothers Virgil and Turk Malloy (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan) infiltrate a Mexican factory to manufacture loaded dice which they then hand-deliver to the casino--but if you need a remote control to operate the dice how come patrons who arent even in on the scam suddenly start winning too? Then theres the Cockney tech geek Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle) who spends large portions of the movie underground burrowing beneath the Bank hotel with a drill so huge it was used to dig the Chunnel from England to France. How a works project of this magnitude would escape the knowledge of everyone in Las Vegas (not to mention seismologists and space satellites) is a plot hole big enough to create a Chunnel of its own.But the Ocean movies arent about plot logic or character development. Theyre spa experiences two-hour-long immersions in a warm tub of Vegas (and Vegas-movie) nostalgia. ""The town has changed"" murmurs Danny as he and Rusty gaze into the fountains of the newfangled Bellagio Hotel reminiscing about the Sands. Shocked that Bank would dare betray a fellow old-timer Tishkoff reminds him ""You shook Sinatras hand"" (Yeah thats a real mark of moral distinction.) Surrendering to Oceans 13s pleasurable surfaces--the green of the gaming tables the deft volleying banter the admirable cut of Clooneys jib--is sort of like admitting your attraction to a luxury brand Sure those alligator loafers are extravagant nonsense but they feel so nice on your feet.

"Going for Broke washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Going for Broke Theyre so hip it hurts Matt Damon George Clooney and Brad Pitt return to the scene of the ""Oceans Eleven"" crime -- Sin City -- in the third ""Oceans"" caper. (By Melinda Sue Gordon -- Warner Bros. Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 8 2007 ""Oceans Thirteen"" is too complicated for its own mediocrity. Oh its not charmless. Its not hard to sit through. It wont crush your spirit and send you to the nearest bar for a long 4 a.m. of the soul. Its maybe halfway between okay and not bad. If being about average were a sin itd be headed straight to Hell on a bobsled. The third in a series of hipster capers ripped off from ""Oceans Eleven"" the original Sinatra Rat Pack hipster caper back in 60 it returns the usual suspects to their usual positions doing their usual shtick in their usual venue. Abandoning the Europe of "" Twelve"" its once again about a big Vegas casino takedown. Once again Brad Pitt wears bad clothes Once again George Clooney pretends he has a sense of humor Once again Matt Damon acts way too cute for a 36-year-old man And Elliott Gould wears giganto mogul glasses He looks like Swifty Lazar at Chasens in the 7os back when Elliott Gould was big. Carl Reiner isnt funny Don Cheadle isnt English Whos the Chinese guy anyway? The kids -- Casey Affleck Scott Caan Eddie Jemison -- dont register this time though they never did did they? And whats the deal with Bernie Mac? The two new recruits Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin are the most impressive. They seem to think actual acting is involved. They invent fictitious personalities to play they do cornball stuff like thinking about their lines finding appropriate movement and makeup contemplating motive -- generally carrying on like professional actors. Didnt they notice what was going on around them? They supply the two best moments though both come early. In the first the great Pacino plays a convivial monster named Willie Bank a hotel-casino tycoon whos just beaten Goulds Reuben Tishkoff out of the Vegas real estate upon which he will erect a vulgar hotel. You can feel Pacino enjoying Banks evil his triumph his narcissistic sense of invulnerability particularly as applied to Gould who in the latter stages of his career plays nothing but pathetic losers like the dotty old man. Its a vivid scene with two gifted performers and its a shame nothing in the picture ever comes close again. Then we are witness to a 30-second deconstruction by snideness where Barkin as Pacinos second-in-command and gal Friday-through-Thursday fires a waitress for gaining four pounds and makes the four pounds seem like grounds for suicide. I mean whats the point of living if youre four pounds over? In one brief scene we know all we need to know about the character. Again not much else comes close as the movie reverts to overly complex gizmo-driven caper job. Thats in retaliation for Pacinos Bank muscling poor Tishkoff out of his property his legacy and his health. You cant do that to one of Danny Oceans boys and so the others convene in Vegas (site of the first movie and the Sinatra original) and decide to take down Mr. Big and his DNA-shaped motel called obviously the Bank to teach him a lesson and to give Goulds Tishkoff something to live for. Its here that the hipsters vacation threatens to become an actual movie. Instead of simply stealing from the newly constructed casino the boys decide it would be better to rig the games so that at a certain point the house advantage is temporarily destroyed and odds favor the gamblers. Therefore in a short order the whales -- as the big rollers seem to be called -- will turn the tables on their harpooner and destroy the place. If youve ever wasted time and money in those vulgar grinding money-vacuums called casinos which traffic in a delusion they sell you at a cost dearer than cocaine its nice to contemplate the collapse of such a thing. (It also recalls a long-ago film noir called ""Force of Evil"" where John Garfield tried to fix the number to come up ""1776"" on the Fourth of July.) And watching the various strategies for busting this or that game -- up to and including inducing labor problems at the dice factory or inducing an earthquake to shut down the counter-cheating computerized security system -- are fascinating. But the director Steven Soderbergh is just having too much fun. The details the plots the stratagems the counter-stratagems mount and mount and mount until the thing reaches a point of such overplotted density that it solidifies over and cant be penetrated. Think of Sleeping Beautys castle clotted with vines and thorns. Thats ""Oceans Thirteen"" frozen in a twine of plot. Hmm what were those two giant 36 million drills for? What was the Chinese guy supposed to do? What about the motorcyclist that the movie just forgets about? Whats Super Dave Osborne doing in this picture anyway hiding under his real name Bob Einstein? Wheres his brother Albert Einstein Brooks? And oh yeah youve got both Pitt and Clooney two of the best actors and greatest stars in the movies today why cant you think up something for them to do? They just sort of stand there Pitt eating greasy burritos Clooney looking like he lost the script and hopes nobody notices until he remembers Oh yeah there wasnt any script. Oceans Thirteen (118 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for adult intensity and profanity.

Depending on your point of view The Bank a luxury hotel and casino looks like a red metalflake bowling trophy about 1000 times larger than scale or a colossal triple-helix of ruby glass. And depending on your point of view Oceans Thirteen is the third retread of a remake or a flashy vehicle fueled by the starpower of George Clooney and Brad Pitt smiles brighter than all the neon in Vegas. Reuniting his posse plus one (Andy Garcias Terry previously Danny Oceans adversary is now an ally) Steven Soderbergh plunks his chips on 13 black. Since the house is rigged there is a payoff. Oceans Thirteen follows Danny Ocean (Clooney) his sidekick Rusty Ryan (Pitt) and their buds as they load dice decks and wheels against The Bank a casino roughly the size of its owners ego. They do this because casinisto Willie Bank (Al Pacino) has scammed their pal Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould). And if The Bank fails ownership reverts to Reuben. Overplayed by a toupeedntucked Pacino Bank is made up to resemble Hollywood mogul Robert Evans who produced Pacino in The Godfather. Its an inside joke for outsiders. As are the many references to the Corleone family saga. Evocatively shot (by Soderbergh under his nom de camera Peter Andrews) with the saturated color of 60s film and accompanied by David Holmes retro-mod score Oceans Thirteen is a boys-night-out lark that girls can enjoy. Speaking of the girls Oprah gets a couple of shout-outs but dont look for Julia Roberts or Catherine Zeta-Jones who wore the skirts in previous episodes of Oceans. Here Ellen Barkin is the femme Banks right-hand woman so distracted by the scent of Matt Damon that she doesnt notice the 13 ways his confederates are planning to rob her boss. While its great to see Barkin back on screen Soderbergh is less interested in what she has to offer above the neck than in her assets below. Does the movie have any point apart from being a showcase for the golden glow and infinite cool of Clooney and Pitt? Danny and Rusty are dedicated to disproving the fellow who puts them down as ""analog players in a digital age."" For Ocean and his merry men the fun is in showing how man can beat machine. The movie does a winning job of demonstrating how wit trumps technology every time.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 8 2007 Save for later Saved The most enjoyable thing about the ""Oceans"" movies is that nobody involved seems to take them seriously. The star wattage is immense but the stars themselves are refreshingly self-deprecating almost satirically so.""Oceans Thirteen"" brings the festivities back to Las Vegas where the series began with ""Oceans Eleven."" (""Oceans Twelve"" was set in Europe.) The Vegas Strip that tribute to greed and glitz is the appropriate abode for the franchise; its not only the place where dreams are made its also where they are cashed in.The new story line is all about revenge. Reuben (Elliott Gould) the friend and mentor of Danny Ocean (George Clooney) has been cheated out of his part ownership in The Bank the Strips most extravagant new hotel-casino operated by predatory potentate Willy Bank (Al Pacino). To exact retribution Danny and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) regroup the federation which includes characters played by Don Cheadle Carl Reiner Bernie Mac and Matt Damon. The plan is brutally simple Break Willy Bank and his Bank. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? How they prepare for this is half the fun. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 A manufacturing plant in Mexico where dice are made is infiltrated a camera is hidden in Banks office slot machines and card shufflers are fixed an earth tremor under the casino is simulated.Director Steven Soderbergh and his screenwriters Brian Koppelman and David Levien who once wrote an intriguing gambling movie called ""Rounders"" recognize that to make all this malarkey work you need two things (a) a cast with effortless charisma and (b) a villain worth hating.Both requirements are met. Clooney is never so at home as a performer as when hes striding through a glitter palace in his tux. This may not qualify as acting exactly but who cares? (Actually Id argue that Clooney is a better performer in the ""Oceans"" movies than he was in say Soderberghs brackish art film ""The Good German."") The other actors especially Carl Reiner are also having a high old time. The clans easygoing throwaway banter has some of the charm of the old Hope-Crosby ""Road"" pictures.As for the villain Pacino makes Bank so eminently loathsome that watching his demise is like witnessing a bug being pulled apart. Most actors love playing bad guys. With Pacino that love borders on adoration.At times ""Oceans Thirteen"" coasts on its star power rather than being propelled by it and some of the set pieces are clunky in the ""Towering Inferno"" mode. There is also a subplot about an undercover evaluator (David Paymer) for a top-ranked hotel award Bank craves that is a bit too punitive. The poor guy is targeted by the clan and his life made miserable. Its hard not to think that the filmmakers are using this critic as payback for all the bad reviews theyve ever received.That shouldnt be an issue this time around.

Al Pacino is her boss. MELINDA SUE GORDON          Matt Damon is back as Linus Caldwell Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan and George Clooney as Danny Ocean in ""Oceans Thirteen."" Its not original but the easy-on-the-eyes leading men make the 122 minutes enjoyable. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Oceans Thirteen"" with George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon Andy Garcia Don Cheadle Bernie Mac Ellen Barkin Al Pacino. Directed by Steven Soderbergh from a screenplay by Brian Koppelman and David Levien. 122 minutes. Rated PG-13 for brief sensuality. ""Oceans Eleven"" the 2001 Las Vegas caper from Steven Soderbergh featuring a host of Hollywood smoothies in sharp suits was a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film of the same name. Now with a stop in between for a larky overseas sequel (""Oceans Twelve"") Soderberghs back in Vegas with ""Oceans Thirteen"" and guess what? Its pretty much another remake -- of the 2001 film to be precise. This is good news or bad news depending on how you felt about Soderberghs ""Oceans Eleven."" If you hated it move right along to the next review and Ill catch you later -- theres nothing here for you. Those who liked the earlier one (I did) will probably find that this one goes down well enough with popcorn that George and Brad and Matt and Don and the gang look snappy and that things move along quickly enough to prevent you from questioning whether the plot makes any sense. But theres a faint partys-over whiff to ""Oceans Thirteen""; a sense that the champagne glass is nearly empty. The storys essentially the same as before with a few little twists from screenwriters Brian Koppelman and David Levien. Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang of wisecracking con men are facing off against a hotel/casino owner named Willy Bank (Al Pacino looking strangely orange) determined to seek revenge and bring him down. The hotel/casino owner they brought down in the first movie Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia velvet-toned as ever) is on Oceans side this time -- hes annoyed because Banks hotel ""casts a shadow on my pool."" Youd think hed be annoyed purely on architectural grounds because Banks hotel looks like a giant pair of garishly painted and violently twisted tweezers but nobody seems to comment on this. So an elaborate plan is hatched involving numerous disguises (Matt Damons Linus gets a new nose) props (Carl Reiners Saul wears a Doctor Doolittle hat) underground excavations (Don Cheadles Basher rarely gets to see the light of day) rigging of casino games calculated seduction invasion of elevator shafts nifty gadgets an on-the-side scheme for a diamond heist (just because you know bringing down the casino isnt enough) constant chewing of gum (or scenery) by the cast and one truly world-class eye roll from Clooney in response to Garcias line ""I was born ready."" Also in the mix is Ellen Barkin as Banks sleek hotel manager who delivers a performance so poised that you almost forget to wonder why she seems to be wearing the same dress all the time. (I can only conclude that because its so tight she cant get it off. Surely this happens occasionally in Vegas.) Soderbergh (who shot the film himself under his cinematographer pseudonym Peter Andrews) has fun with the look of the film playing with split screens noirish lighting overlays and occasional jolts of color. And the cast who half the time seem to be improvising their lines play their roles with infectious if predictable glee. Its all perfectly enjoyable -- indeed far more entertaining than last months droopy casino comedy ""Lucky Me"" -- but doesnt add much to a formula that was fresher on its last visit to Vegas. The party may well be ending for these gentlemen but it was fun while it lasted.

"Lucky 13 - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeLucky 13DANNY OCEANS GANG FINALLY GETS A WORTHY ADVERSARY IN AL PACINOBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 06/07/2007 100000 PM PDTUpdated 06/08/2007 031525 PM PDT As the cutthroat casino owner Willy Bank in ""Oceans Thirteen"" Al Pacino is all capped teeth and man-tan. Even his hair appears to be tinted tangerine. Hes like an orange version of Michael Corleone. One of the inside jokes that makes ""Thirteen"" the luckiest number in this heist series is the resemblance of Pacinos bespectacled terror to Moe Greene the Vegas casino crum-bum he had whacked in ""The Godfather."" Long before he started glowing like one of the Strips neon marquees. If the overstuffed caper comedies ""Oceans Eleven"" and ""Twelve"" lacked for anything it was an adversary villainous enough to hold his own against Danny Ocean and an actor formidable enough to hold the screen opposite George Clooney who plays the series charming bandit. Pacino in all his radiant colors fills that hole. Robbing heavily fortified casinos of hundreds of millions of dollars is the definition of a niche occupation and yet no one - not even ""The Bank"" - ever seems to see Oceans 11 coming. Bank should. He has swindled Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) out of his share of the phallus-shaped casino hotel that Bank is about to open. When Reuben suffers a heart attack his old pal Danny Ocean offers Bank a chance to make good. But Bank says the high-roller should ""roll over and die."" This leaves Oceans crew no choice apparently but to take some of the glow out of Banks cheeks. After the storys wheels are set in motion you pretty much know everything thats going to happen but director Steven Soderbergh makes it fun to watch your winning hand unfold.Advertisement A big part of the charm of this series is that its nice to see nice-looking people looking nice. And no movie star - not Cary Grant nor Fred Astaire or even Marlene Dietrich - ever looked as good in a tuxedo as Clooney does here. He and Brad Pitt who plays co-ringleader Rusty Ryan have a rapport that doesnt create sparks - the way Paul Newman and Robert Redford did in their buddy pictures - but it does produce a warm glow. At one point Ocean and Ryan reminisce about the old days in Vegas before Cirque du Soleil took over from the Mob and old casinos like the Sands and the Dunes were replaced by monstrosities such as the Bank. Ocean and Ryan seem to yearn for their days as Vegas players but they never do anything in this movie resembling play. They only plan. The difference between this crew and the Rat Pack stars of the original ""Oceans Eleven"" in 1960 is that you could almost smell the Jack Daniels coming off the screen from Frank Dino and Sammy. These guys look like they only stop reading blueprints and building specs long enough for a quick game of basketball. Terry Benedict the casino owner played by Andy Garcia who was the bad guy in the first two pictures is back but this time hes something of an ally helping to finance Oceans plan. Its a good thing too because by even the most conservative reckoning the up-front money for the scheme figures to be about 50 million. Even so success appears to be only a dim possibility. Like all caper movies this one requires a good deal of setup and Soderbergh delivers it painlessly explaining how each of the big games in Banks casino has been rigged. Oceans tech guru Roman Nagel (Eddie Izzard) helps devise a plan to confound the casinos supposedly infallible security - an artificial intelligence system called Greco. Yes thats right its a Greco-Roman showdown. Ocean wont commit his forces without an ""exit strategy"" - this puts him one up on the Pentagon - but the plan defies logic so completely that the only thing you can possibly do is give in to it. It calls for the deployment of the English Chunnel-digging devices - two of them - which is actually easier to accept than the fact that Don Cheadle who plays mechanical whiz Basher Tarr spends most of the movie with them down a hole. To keep all 11 members of the crew busy there is considerable padding in the plot which is the only possible explanation for Virgil and Turk Malloy (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan) leading a strike at a Mexican dice-making factory. In the previous two pictures those splinter sub-plots werent always funny enough to feel justified but Afflecks rabble-rousing for better wages - which is both fake-mustachioed and subtitled - is hilarious. So is a perfectly executed homage to ""The Godfather"" which has nothing to do with Michael Corleone or Moe Greene and will probably escape the notice of most of the ""Oceans"" audience. (""Godfather"" showoffs will be easy to identify by their ostentatiously loud laughter during what seems to be a serious scene.) You know ""Oceans Thirteen"" is tinted more golden than orange when it manages to get two Oprah-related laughs and theyre at the characters expense not hers. The movie is generous that way. It robs you blind but sends you home feeling as if youve gotten something.

Starring George Clooney Brad Pitt Al Pacino Matt Damon Ellen Barkin and Elliot Gould. Directed by Steven Soderbergh. (PG-13. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) To recap The first of the modern ""Oceans"" pictures ""Oceans Eleven"" was mostly entertaining benefiting from a strong caper plot. But it didnt quite have the right playfulness of spirit and it got bogged down (a little not fatally) in the forlorn lost-romance scenes involving George Clooney and a scowling Julia Roberts. ""Oceans Twelve"" solved the problem of mood. The movie seemed like it must have been a party to make and it solved the Roberts problem too -- she lightened up. But the story was a mess; it made no sense and the fun-caper aspect was gone or at least weakened. Which brings us to today to ""Oceans Thirteen"" and the rare case of a movie franchise following ""The Three Bears"" pattern The third one is just right. Like the first ""Oceans"" ""Oceans Thirteen"" is a satisfying story of a grand-scale swindle but it also retains the impishness and charm of ""Oceans Twelve."" Even better it solves the Roberts problem in the most thorough and economical way possible Shes not in the movie. This time Al Pacino gets to be the villain and that says a lot about the movies appeal. He plays an unscrupulous entrepreneur opening a hotel in Las Vegas which means he gets to wear loud suits and treat everybody like garbage exactly the kind of behavior we want and expect from Pacino. The first victim of his callous thieving is poor Elliot Gould as Reuben. The crooked Willy Bank (Pacino) tricks him in business wipes him out financially and leaves him crumpled on the floor with a heart attack. ""He made the right choice"" Willy says. ""Roll over and die."" But Reuben doesnt die. And Reuben has friends including Danny Ocean (Clooney) Rusty (Brad Pitt) and oh say about nine or 10 other guys. Willy is gearing up to open his hotel and casino -- set to be the most exclusive and luxurious place in Vegas -- but Oceans gang is out to bring him down. With that I have just described the only thing I understood about ""Oceans Thirteen"" which points up a funny thing about movie storytelling. Many of the specifics of the plan to fleece Willy are almost impenetrable. Perhaps theyre meant to be impenetrable. There was certainly no anxiety on director Steven Soderberghs part that everything should be clear. Yet it doesnt really matter if a thousand small details are unclear so long as theres no mistaking the broad movement of the story Theres Pacino. Clooney Pitt and company are going to rob him. So sit back and enjoy the spectacle. Soderbergh who brought his moodiness to bear on ""Oceans Eleven"" and his love of absurdity and zaniness to bear on ""Oceans Twelve"" keeps his directorial personality out of ""Oceans Thirteen"" but his artistry is everywhere. The first shot which takes place in the middle of a routine heist has an offhand elegance. Especially impressive -- youll feel it even if you dont notice the technique -- is the early shot of Pitt leaving a building and walking toward a private airplane. Pitt in a cream-colored suit is shot from below with the sky behind him so that he looks like a lord of the universe. When the plane comes into the frame the angle actually makes Pitt look taller than the plane. Clooney doesnt get that sort of visual support here but his easy charm is all over the picture. Andy Garcia brings sly comedy to Benedict once Oceans enemy now his (sort of) ally. Its a strong ""Oceans"" as well for Matt Damon who has several good scenes seducing Ellen Barkin as Willys assistant. As for Barkin consider this Shes practically the only woman in the movie. That means that at 53 shes all the sex this movie is going to have -- and all it needs as it turns out. The film is packed with entertaining bits. One of the best involves a hotel reviewer (David Paymer) who comes to Willys casino -- and the steps taken by Oceans gang to assure that he has the worst time of his life. There are looney technological gadgets and a funny running gag about a workers rebellion in Mexico. The whole film is full of invention and about the only bad thing that can be said for ""Oceans Thirteen"" is that the climax almost doesnt feel like a climax. It feels more like there should be another turn a topper. But the best thing trumps the bad thing. Audiences will come away feeling that there could be nothing more rewarding and pleasurable than being a high-stakes world-class thief. It just looks like a beautiful life. -- Advisory Strong language and lawlessness.

Wednesday June 13 2007 1124 AM Standing on the Strip in Las Vegas staring across a man-made lake at the posh Bellagio Hotel George Clooney and Brad Pitt bemoan the changes from the good old Vegas days of the Stardust and the Sands Hotel back when things werent so big.One could be just as nostalgic about ""Oceans Eleven"" the 1960 Rat Pack movie that was relaunched as an elaborately overproduced tent-pole franchise starring a latter-day lower-case rat pack with Clooney reprising Frank Sinatras suave Danny Ocean and Pitt as the laid-back sidekick played by Dean Martin.""Oceans Thirteen"" the third film in Steven Soderberghs red-carpet series returns to the scene of the low-tech original and the 2001 remake. Though it may be the most entertaining of the Clooney-Pitt movies it underscores in nearly every scene its debt to Sinatra et al. as well as its inability to duplicate the Rat Packs connection to Vegas.""He shook Frank Sinatras hand"" is a repeated encomium in ""O13"" which would be an odd bit of name-dropping in a movie flush with contemporary stars if its attempt to provide a heart for the film werent so transparent.""Oceans Thirteen"" is passingly enjoyable summer fluff but if you can find a more genial less edgy caper movie you might want to own it as a pet.Ditching the ""Mission Impossible""-type plot complications of the first two films ""O13"" is a straight-ahead revenge comedy with Dannys gang trying to destroy the grand opening of a flashy new Strip hotel owned by Willy Bank (Al Pacino) the thieving mogul who gave Dannys mentor - a man who shook Sinatras hand - a heart attack by stealing the land from him.When a plea for fairness fails Dannys enlarged crew sets out to infiltrate the hotel staff rig the casino games figure out how to beat a state-of-the-art security system and steal millions of dollars worth of diamonds in the process.What ensues is sometimes clever often funny and almost never believable. And though the movie returns Andy Garcias thug casino owner Terry Benedict and from ""O12"" Vincent Cassels Francois Toulour there is no suspense or tension.Its just a whimsical and very expensive (Im talking ticket prices now) get-together.jmathewsnydailynews.com Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Comments Oceans Thirteen Just a way station between Oceans Twelve (2004) and the inevitable ""Oceans Fourteen"" this third installment in the franchise is outlandish even as fantasy a labyrinthine revenge caper undertaken after evil lug Al Pacino double-crosses sweet-tempered lug Elliott Gould (part of the usual crew) out of his share of a Vegas hotel-casino. George Clooney Brad Pitt Matt Damon Don Cheadle Bernie Mac and Carl Reiner are all back though Julia Roberts has taken a powder as designated sex object and been replaced by a villainous Ellen Barkin the butt of much ageist ridicule. Predictably adolescent and smarmy with the mix of sentimentality and cynical flippancy thats becoming Steven Soderberghs specialty (even when hes pretending to make art films) this is chewing gum for the eyes and ears and not bad as such.

"Oceans Thirteen | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; ocean-s-thirteen ) Oceans Thirteen (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli I may be in the minority but I dont consider Oceans Twelve to be the dog that some critics have labeled it. Sure its a little self-indulgent but its a genial caper drama that allows us to spend some time in the company of the survivors of the 2001 remake of Oceans Eleven. Now along comes Oceans Thirteen and its back to basics. This is a stripped-down plot-oriented heist movie where character development and interpersonal interaction have been set aside in order to keep the parts clicking. Its like watching a huge Rube Goldberg machine. The end result is a foregone conclusion. The fascination comes from watching the contortions necessary to get there and guess what will happen next to propel events forward. All of the previous Oceans Eleven male cast members are back although the two women - Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta-Jones - have elected to sit this one out leaving full estrogen duties to Ellen Barkin. The films new big gun is Al Pacino who has his share of Al Pacino moments including a nice little rant to keep us from forgetting who he is. Hes surrounded by about a dozen actors who have been through this twice before and seem so comfortable around each other than one suspects they might not be doing much acting. The Oceans movies have always been a lark for director Stephen Soderbergh and his stars and nothing has changed this time around for this modern-day Rat Pack. Rumor has it there wont be an Oceans Fourteen but the way these guys enjoy playing off one another and tossing around one-liners it cant be ruled out. With the exception of a few opening scenes designed to inform us what an utter bastard Willie Bank (Pacino) is Oceans Thirteen is all about the Big Caper. In this case its to ruin Willie who is opening a new Vegas Casino using land and money bilked from Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould). Reuben has a heart attack as a result of his treatment at Willies hands and now the gang led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) wants revenge. Their idea put the casino deep in the red and steal 250 million in diamonds. Its a huge risky expensive proposition and it requires deeper pockets than Danny and his compatriots have so they go to an unlikely source for funding casino mogul Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) their previous adversary. Terry is interested but for a price 72 million - a more than 100% return on his investment. But hes in this for more than the money. Like Oceans crew he wants to see Willie squirm. The caper unfolds slowly like an onion being peeled. The movie doesnt waste time with side plots or character building. This is roughly a 100 minute biopsy of every aspect of the crime. The movie keeps the audience guessing but is never too far ahead that were in danger of becoming lost nor too far behind that we get the sense that the characters are slow-witted morons. Soderbergh sustains viewer interest which allows the pacing to be brisk even though the amount of action is minimal. As thrillers go this is a pretty low key affair. Theres plenty of tension but theres more comedy than there is conventional action. Each character gets his moment but because there are so many of them to accommodate during the two-hour running length none of those moments is lengthy. Oceans Thirteen is the first sequel of the summer of 2007 not to fall on its face. The film is better paced and more involving than Oceans Twelve but perhaps not as well executed as Oceans Eleven. The appeal of the series isnt just the serpentine nature of the story which by definition is out to trick the viewer but seeing so many famous faces together in one place. Theres something old fashioned about how this movie has been made and presented and this is highlighted by the psychedelic opening and closing credits. The movie doesnt go deeply retro like Grindhouse but it intentionally raises memories of the original Rat Pack even going so far as to invoke Frank Sinatra by name and by song. The differences between Ocean and Clooney and Rusty and Pitt have become so blurred that a late-movie exchange between them carries a double meaning. It can be seen as an exchange between the characters or the actors and makes sense in either context. The screenplay isnt a masterpiece of misdirection but it is smart enough that one can feel comfortable about keeping ones intelligence engaged as things unfold. The lack of explosions and gunfire makes this an atypical summer thriller but its breezy brand of unforced and occasionally self-referential entertainment is a lot more fun than pirates webslingers and green ogres.

By David Denby Kevin Costner and Demi Moore in a surprising new thriller.   Credit TOM BACHTELL Alfred Hitchcock used to complain about moviegoers who refused to yield to the pleasures of narrative. ""The plausibles"" he called them--viewers who rather than enjoying one of his stories about two ordinary people caught up in some sort of sinister affair would nag at minor details or ask ""Why dont they call the cops?"" To narrative filmmakers the plausibles ask the wrong questions and make the wrong demands. They should care not whether a thriller is absolutely consistent but whether it gives good nasty jolts. ""Mr. Brooks"" a new thriller starring Kevin Costner is a challenge to the literal-minded. A local celebrity in Portland Oregon a self-made millionaire with a loving wife and daughter Earl Brooks has a secret life he is addicted to murder. Every now and then over a period of several years with excruciating guilt as well as considerable enjoyment he has gone out at night and committed a perfect crime. He has a superb enabler--an alter ego (William Hurt) whom he calls for some reason Marshall and who accompanies him everywhere. No one else of course can see Marshall and when Brooks converses with him people think that he is merely lost in thought. Marshall is Brookss desire his madness and his sanity too--the part of him that wants to kill people and also calculates how to avoid getting caught. Think of him as ego and superego rolled into one hyperarticulate pest. The movie which was written by Bruce A. Evans and Raynold Gideon and directed by Evans is so well made and so compelling as a portrait of a man at war with himself that right up until the end many people will probably be entertained by its intricately preposterous story. Perhaps the most surprising element is that the onscreen alter ego--normally a tiresome device--turns out to be a big part of the fun. Kevin Costner who is famously talented at playing athletes but often stiff even monotonous and smug when playing other roles gives his best performance in years. As Brooks he is formidable and distant at work relaxed and authoritative at home and sardonic and almost viciously funny on his late-night jaunts. Costner seems to be exploring aspects of himself that hes never put on the screen before. His Mr. Brooks is a smart guy whos good at reading situations and figuring out what other people want--a businessmans skills which the movie in a mildly subversive turn suggests might also make for a good murderer. Costner was obviously attracted to the expansive possibilities in the script; after reading it he agreed to co-produce the movie. And he also loosened up I would guess because he got to play opposite William Hurt now the most brilliant character actor in American movies. Marshall pleading with his host to commit murder is a roguish wit seductive and amused who knows that hes being unreasonable but presses his needs anyway. Once satisfied he becomes the ultimate kibbitzer--he doesnt have to do anything but give advice and render judgment on Brookss criminal panache. Hurt tucking in his jaw and alternating irony sarcasm and mockery hits one spinning serve after another and Costner hits them right back at him. The two have a fine time as if they had been doing this routine for years. Brooks has a peculiar adversary--a voyeur with satanic eyebrows (the comic Dane Cook) who photographed him killing a naked young couple. He blackmails Brooks but he doesnt want money. He wants to be taken along on Brookss next night out; hes an aspiring murder junkie. Brooks has an even more formidable foe--a tough homicide detective named Tracy Atwood played by Demi Moore in full battle mode as a woman fighting not only crime but a parasitical husband. Speaking of her character Moore has said ""The rage Atwood has is something that I personally dont like"" which is odd since in so many of her movies rage is the main thing she has going for her. Moore is easier to watch when her roles (including Atwood) allow her to use explicitly what some people find intolerable about her--her desire to overdefine any given situation so that she can control it. The screenplay adds a third wild card Brookss beloved college-age daughter (Danielle Panabaker) who may have murderous tendencies of her own. Twenty years ago Evans and Gideon wrote the coming-of-age drama ""Stand by Me."" Like Earl Brooks they clearly have a talent for the dark side and this movie though it goes wrong at the end suggests that Evans as a director should give in to it. The rhythm of the picture switches between long silent sequences in which Brooks falls into a state of murderous abstraction and the elegant notation of physical movement--a hand entering a frame photographs burning in a kiln. Evans will never be Hitchcock but he produces enough pleasurable tension to send the plausibles into a frenzy of disapproval. In 1959 about the same time that Doris Day successfully defended her honor from Rock Hudsons assault in ""Pillow Talk"" an extremely pretty Bronx girl named Linda Riss fought off a married lawyer named Burt Pugach. He was thirty-two Linda ten years younger. Pugach wasnt much to look at and his honesty both personal and professional was intermittent at best but he had some money. He took Linda to ""a cabaret in New Rochelle"" and flew her around in his Piper Cub. Trying to account for Burts appeal Lindas friends in recent interviews cite his exalted status in the lower-middle-class Bronx. He had a Cadillac He had a plane At first Burt pursued Linda without telling her that he was married; he then produced a set of divorce papers a forgery exposed by Lindas mother. Through all this Linda resolving like Doris Day not to ""give it away"" held out for a marriage proposal. Despite many further endearments from Burt she agreed to marry a good-looking young man named Larry Schwartz whereupon Burt hired three thugs to throw lye in her face so that the young man would no longer want her. This barbaric act which left Linda nearly sightless wound up tying her and Burt together for life. The fascinating documentary ""Crazy Love"" directed by the filmmaker and public-relations executive Dan Klores is a real-world story as redolent of the time and place as Dion and the Belmonts in which possessiveness stupidity loyalty and need are joined together in bewildering combinations. Its as if some disreputable and unending liaison out of Greek mythology had arisen on the streets of the East Bronx to be celebrated not with poetry but with front-page headlines. Like ""Capturing the Friedmans"" Kloress movie uses media archeology to reveal the layers of untoward behavior beneath the responsible surface of American Jewish life. Klores incorporates still photographs home movies and stock footage feeding them into extensive current-day interviews with the two principals their friends and a local philosopher Jimmy Breslin who says ""Nobody is as visibly insane as Burt Pugach and still not institutionalized."" But Breslins judgment is not quite right. Klores and his editor David Zieff hold a few surprises in reserve one of which is that Burt is occasionally something more than a demented lowlife. Linda now seventy with a large pile of hair and dark glasses seems a tough and practical woman; Burt eighty with a Mephistophelian goatee comes off not as pathological but as exceptionally egotistical wily larcenous and guilty. His love for Linda redeems him and he knows it. One may be horrified by these two or laugh at them but both horror and laughter give way to amazement at the human talent for survival. You can build a ship--maybe a whole fleet--in a bottle but then what do you do with it? For Steven Soderberghs ""Oceans Thirteen"" an enormous Las Vegas casino--the centerpiece of a new mega-hotel The Bank named after its egomaniacal owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino)--was constructed on a Hollywood soundstage. This movie is certainly more hardworking than ""Oceans Twelve"" in which Danny Rusty and the boys lounging at George Clooneys villa on Lake Como barely condescended to speak their lines between drinks. The script by Brian Koppelman and David Levien is a revenge plot Bank has swindled the gangs beloved mentor Reuben (Elliott Gould) so Danny and the others plan to louse up the opening of Banks hotel. Soderbergh assembles the elements of their complicated scheme--which involves magnetizing dice and creating an earthquake--into short punchy scenes and edits them together at top speed. But after a lot of buildup not much happens at the climax. The casino set hardly gets explored. Soderbergh ends the movie with a few jokes which is casual and neat but leaves you wondering whether the practice of making enormous movies about nothing isnt a little mad.

Plus Penguins Surfing Hooray _ By David Edelstein ShareThis Illustration by Henry Jansen  (Photo Melinda Sue Gordon/Courtesy of Warner Bros.) Is it disheartening for Steven Soderbergh that his best movie in years is his swank Vegas caper comedy Oceans 13and not his searching remake of Tarkovskys Solaris; his rough-hewn study of the dark side of working-class life Bubble; or his subversive anti-Casablanca The Good German? In those ambitious films in virtually everything he has done since his debut sex lies and videotape Soderbergh has probed the unreliability of surfaces in life and onscreensurfaces that mask corruption that put a glamorous sheen on the messy and duplicitous that call into question the very medium in which he works. Now comes Oceans 13 which is all surface all impossible glamoura big lie lofted into the stratosphere by grotesque amounts of Hollywood cash. Its so money Its so fun The moviethe second sequel in a franchise that began as a remakeglides in on a wave of hipsterism on Vegas-y jazz and A-list leading men who saunter across the color-saturated screen in exquisitely tailored suits. There are no visual or moral dissonances. Our twinkling thieves led by Danny Ocean (George Clooney) arent in it for the money. Theyre out to avenge their friend and elder Reuben (Elliot Gould) whoin one of several pretzeled flashbacksgets muscled out of a deal by casino magnate Willy Bank (Al Pacino flashing his choppers under a curly hennaed thatch). Reuben is heartbroken both literally and figuratively (You shook Sinatras hand he gaspsas if only men of honor ever did); he lies now in a quasi coma his fragile spirit presumably waiting for news of his nemesiss emasculation. Its a-comin because Oceans 13 must prove mightier than Pacinos palatial casino and its impregnable security system. Unlike that non-team-player these men are willing to surrender their individuality and become cogs in the greater machine just as these stars now let themselves be pieces of the greater ensemblealthough not admittedly for love. (The two words Hollywood actors most like to hear are sequel money.) In its worship of the perfect con as a multifaceted machine Oceans 13 is the real remake of the old TV series Mission Impossible which Tom Cruise neutered when he put himself and his ridiculous running leaps at the center. Heartthrob-wise the Cruise equivalent here is Brad Pitta contented second banana to Clooney. Matt Damon is an insecure nerd. Don Cheadle is a mechanic (and hallelujah scales back his Cockney accent the worst since Dick Van Dykes). Bernie Mac is barely a blip but the others get face time Scott Caan Casey Affleck Eddie Jemison Shaobo Qin Carl Reiner The new member of the team turns out to be Oceans previous arch-enemy casino owner Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) who resents Banks new place for throwing a shadow over his swimming pool. Garcia gets a fat pedestal and grooves on it He has never looked so sleek and sharp and dangerously pleased with himself. The previous sequel Oceans 12 had an excellent farce subplot in which Julia Robertss Tess was drafted to impersonate Julia Roberts. But the movie was otherwise a muddle. This one without Julia or any love interest is as elegant and streamlined as its hero. The screenwriters Brian Koppelman and David Levien (Rounders) turn the absence of wives/girlfriends into a joke Clooney and Pitt rap about their disintegrating relationships between hashing out the minutiae of generating an earthquake under part of Vegas. As nice as a bit of cheesecake would be this is basically a juvenile male-bonding fantasy in which women serve no purpose but to poop on the party. What sex remains is a clown show with Ellen Barkin as Pacinos chief of operations driven mad with desire for Matt Damon in a big fake nose. (Its good to see Barkin back after years of decorating her gilded cage.) Are all the feints and interlocking scams and triple-crosses easy to follow? Sort of. Well no. But Soderbergh is a savvy guy. As the plotting gets knottier his technique gets more fluidthe editing jazzier the colors more luscious the whip-pans more whizbang. Its all anchored by Clooney looking impudent roguish almost laughably handsome. The characterthe whole movieseems to emanate from his well-known real-life penchant for practical jokes. Maybe Soderberghs work in Oceans 13 isnt so superficial after all. Maybe after questioning every lustrous image in The Good German he was liberated by Vegas that monument to ersatz. Is it possible that only a director so distrustful of surfaces could surrender so thrillingly to the big lie? I wonder what its like to grow up in a world in which so many kid shows and movies are meta. Characters in fairy tales lampoon their status as characters in fairy tales. Tween sitcoms and variety shows take place behind the scenes of tween sitcoms and variety shows. Im sure most of this stuff is less pernicious than many actual fairy tales or the retro sitcoms that I was stuck watching. (Bewitched anyone?)

So today when Oceans Thirteen was the main attraction many critics anticipated it with pleasure-- if only as playtime after a weeks homework studying and reporting on the worthiest art films. [an error occurred while processing this directive] We knew that sometimes nothing looks so good on the giant Festival Palais screen as a bad Hollywood movie. In 1992 the Opening Night entry was Basic Instinct that chicly sleazy sex-and-violence thriller starring Michael Douglas Sharon Stone and the space between Sharon Stones legs. U.S. critics had seen the movie months before and dumped their contempt on it. Yet in the Lumiere Theatre at Cannes on that 60-ft.-wide canvas it had the kind of luminosity confidence and throbbing pulse that no Franco-Polish minimalist masterpiece could match. This we were reminded is why audiences in almost every foreign country prefer Hollywood movies to their own because ours are bigger slicker -- movie-er. And how Stones glamour spilled off the screen -- her old-fashioned beauty of course but also the devouring eyes and grown-up voice and her evident pleasure in being watched. It was that evening in the Palais (and remember Id seen Basic Instinct at a critics showing in New York) that I became convinced of what I still believe that Stone is one of the few people in the post-Golden Age era who deserves that venerable epithet ""movie star."" Another unquestionably would be George Clooney. He has all the old qualities classically handsome but not intimidatingly so looking perfect and comfortable in a tuxedo and so at ease with his natural appeal -- his Georgeness -- that he neednt rev up or Method up a performance to screaming volume. After all he came out of TV where the goal is to be ingratiating not from the stage or indie films where the goal is threefold sulk simmer and explode. Clooney glides and purrs through his movies (and his public appearances) with a grace both manly and feline. Hes a mans man and a womans; and I know a few frustrated Democrats who say that if hed run for President hed be their man. In Oceans Thirteen (third in the series after Eleven and Twelve) Clooney is again Danny Ocean the gentleman heistmeister and once more is surrounded by some pricey film flesh Brad Pitt also very easy on the eyes and Matt Damon and lots of the old gang in smaller roles Bernie Mac Andy Garcia Carl Reiner Don Cheadle Elliott Gould Casey Affleck. Julia Roberts took this film off but Al Pacino and Ellen Barkin -- last seen together 18 years ago performing urgent stand-up sex in Sea of Love-- are on board for star wattage and the nostalgia factor. Sounds eminently sit-throughable and on the big Palais screen watchable. The plot-- not it matters to you or did to anyone connected with the movie -- has Gould as a venerable Vegas mogul driven to a coronary seizure because hes been snookered out of a hotel he co-owned with the rapacious Pacino. (It used to be Goulds gold; now its a Pacino casino.) Clooney amp; Co. agree to avenge their old pal by taking Pacino down rigging the games so he loses millions on opening night stealing a cache of precious diamonds from the usual impenetrable display and subverting his fond expectation of winning for his hotel the highest five diamonds rating from some imaginary Michelin guide. In previous films this Mission Implausible team took stuff because it was hey fun. This time its personal. But for director Steven Soderbergh and his actors and his crew this time its mechanical. They must think that the only way get from Eleven to Twelve to Thirteen is to make movies by the numbers. Lets hope that in naming future sequels they dont start counting backward; the whole audience will be in a trance or asleep by Nine. The new film is so listless and logy it needed Michael Moore to take it to Cuba for emergency medical treatment. In a summer-movie preview that ran last week on TIME.com I speculated about Oceans Thirteen ""If Take 3 is a reasonable facsimile of its predecessors it will be like one of those elite parties youre dying to attend because of the killer guest list; then you get in and find that for all the star glamour in evidence the ambiance is somehow... lacking."" Turns out my hopes were too high. Its as if the whole enterprise were running on battery power that was about to give out. The five big stars cant shake the movies infectious lethargy and some of the others like Mac and Cheadle have so little to do that its a wonder they showed up (though Gould and Reiner are OK and Eddie Izzard squeezes some life into his cameo as an amiable criminal super-brain). The dialogue by scripters Brian Koppelman and David Levien aims for smart and hits smarmy; and the actors delivery of their lines meant to show a relaxed wit is perfunctory verging on read-through. With one exception. Gould evoking the old-time Vegas when he learns how rotten Pacino is ""You and I both shook Sinatras hand and theres a code among the guys who shook Sinatras hand."" Pacino ""Screw Sinatras hand."" Frank Sinatra was the star behind the original 1960 Oceans Eleven (original in that it came first) and three ensuing numerical Rat Pack capers Sergeants 3 4 Guns for Texas Robin and the 7 Hoods. Frank and his pals -- Dean Martin Sammy Davis Jr. Peter Lawford Joey Bishop -- werent trying to commit art or even make vital entertainment. Really they had expectations no higher than the Soderbergh-Clooney mob. Both groups were underachievers and proud of it. The Rat Packs idea such as it was was to do a movie in a friendly town (Vegas Chicago) or familiar genre (caper Western gangster movie) and apply to it a bit of the ad-lib roguery they brought to their nightclub gigs. The slapdash nature of the script performances and production was meant to reflect the informal what-the-hell lets-pretend-were-having-a-ball impulse that led to their making. These were movies that loosened the tuxedo tie and the tongue to provide an intoxicated if not intoxicating diversion. They were loosy-goosy for the time and instantly irrelevant. Marijuana would soon replace alcohol as the younger generations drug of choice; nobody wore a tie let alone a tux after his senior prom. If the revival or exhumation of the Rat Pack series has reason to exist (big if) its to prove that Hollywood still knows how to parade the old careless glamour. Thats the only reason an audience has to see the Ocean movies. So the biggest surprise and disappointment about the new one is not that its kind of a corpse but that the stars arent made to look beautiful sexy starrish. Why is the lighting technician for the Golden Globes where Clooney is always Mr. Fabulous more knowing about how to photograph him than Soderbergh (who shot the film under the pseudonym Peter Andrews)? How come Damon is more handsome and engaging in person than in this movie? When Pitt is first spotted he looks as though he fell asleep for a year under a sun lamp. Pacino it takes a few seconds to recognize; he too looks weird and so does Barkin. Her face has the recognizable intelligence and insolence but the rest of her seems somehow bronzed and sanded -- an unfortunate impression for a comeback performance. These people know how to make the camera love them; theyve been doing it for years in some cases decades. So I have to think what I saw today was a prank of the emulsion or the director. The big Palais screen as longtime festivalgoers can vouch is supposed to lend an extra radiance to Hollywood stars. Soderbergh makes them look like Nick Nolte in that mug shot.

As smooth as a good mojito as stylish as an Armani suit and as meaningful in the grand scheme of things as yesterdays Las Vegas betting odds ""Oceans Thirteen"" continues the breezy good times of the first two series entries without missing a beat. By returning the action to Vegas producer Jerry Weintraub and director Steven Soderbergh recapture the feel of the 2001 original after the 2004 European detour that bugged some fans. With George Brad Matt and the rest pulling another ultra-cool con without breaking a sweat and with Al Pacino ideal as their new nemesis Warner Bros. can bet on cashing in for yet another franchise payday. Script by Brian Koppelman and David Levien who penned the sharp gambling-world drama ""Rounders"" puts all its dramatic chips on the anticipated comeuppance of a thoroughly reprehensible baddie. Egomaniacal Vegas kingpin Willy Bank (Pacino) has screwed the beloved Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) out of his part ownership in Banks latest venture the Strips most grandiose and luxurious hotel-casino. Banks unscrupulous reputation preceded him but Reuben made the mistake of trusting him since they are among the few pioneers left old enough to have shaken Sinatras hand. With Reuben in critical condition from shock Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) gather the clan together again to avenge their mentor. The Bank as the new pleasure palace is known is to bow July 3 and the men swiftly concoct a fantastically complicated high-tech scheme to sabotage the opening divest Bank of his riches ruin his reputation and restore Reuben to health and wealth in one fell swoop. No problem for these guys except that Banks empire and the systems that are in place to secure it appear to be impregnable. Much of the fun then stems from the dizzying ways in which Oceans team surmounts the difficulties Dice is magnetized in Mexico card shufflers and slot machines are rigged a camera is snuck into Banks office would-be high-rollers are brought in and pulled out. Most audaciously an earthquake is artificially stimulated under the Bank (using a giant drill formerly used to carve out the Chunnel -- specifically the one that started on the French side) forcing the evacuation of the casino at a crucial moment. On top of all this when Ocean runs low on funds hes forced to turn to Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) his adversary in the first film for further financing which is forthcoming on one condition-that Ocean steal the diamonds Bank has hidden away in an unreachable place in his building. A problem but again no problem. So much for the high stakes. What seems to obsess Bank most is the Five Diamond Award a top hotel ranking hes achieved at all his other establishments worldwide. Pics most amusing subplot involves Carl Reiners Sal Bloom posing as an evaluator assessing the Bank during its soft opening run while the real ratings man played by David Paymer in ultra-schleppy victim mode is beset by all manner of ill-treatment by hotel staff real and otherwise. Last but not least Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) turns up as the ultra-efficient (and fake schnozzed) Man Friday to would-be high-roller Mr. Weng (Shaobo Qin) in order to romantically distract Banks sharp-eyed No. 2 (Ellen Barkin) during the opening festivities. Most of the action plays out at the imposing Bank hotel a faintly absurd but nonetheless amazing twisting structure that dominates the Vegas skyline thanks to impeccable CGI work and impresses via the interiors conjured by production designer Philip Messina. Unlike ""Oceans Eleven"" which locationed in a genuine casino new film was shot on a lavish set built on Warner Bros. biggest soundstage. The main room is a double-level balconied affair with an Asian motif. Decor is dominated by sumptuous golds and reds with money dripping from every frame as Soderbergh under his nom de camera Peter Andrews shoots this one more steadily and glamorously than he did the first entry. As before most of the scenes are deliberately underplayed banter sessions dominated by quick give-and-take knowing exchanges and sly understatement among a members-only troupe. Everyone looks their best and knows they can never be one-upped as befits some of Hollywoods biggest stars brandishing a we-know-we-have-it-and-you-dont unflappable cool that stops short of the arrogance some detected in ""Oceans Twelve."" Only moments of something remotely resembling reflection and emotion are delivered in pics most appealing scene in which Danny and Rusty either toward dawn or dusk walk along a street deliberately framed to accentuate trees and an elegant Euro-style backdrop and discuss Reuben and the Vegas they used to know before everything changed. Cast fab production values and a pace that never flags keep the fizz on the series. Another entry is indicated by the final dialogue exchanges. Taking his leave Damon tells Clooney and Pitt ""See you when I see you."" Pitt then bids adieu to Clooney with own little in-jokes ""Hey Next time Keep the weight off. Have a couple of kids.""
