Often called the first genuine science-fiction novel H.G. Wells 1894 classic provides unlimited opportunities in the anything-is-possible world of effects-driven CGI-oriented popular movies. Although it gets off to a decent start this ""Time Machine"" breaks down when it gets to the distant future which in this case isnt a good place to be stranded. Often called the first genuine science-fiction novel H.G. Wells 1894 classic provides unlimited opportunities in the anything-is-possible world of effects-driven CGI-oriented popular movies. But despite fine production values and some smarts that surface here and there this ambitious DreamWorks/Warner Bros. co-venture devolves creatively as it advances dramatically ending in generically familiar territory thats far closer to that of last years lamentable ""Planet of the Apes"" remake than anyone might have wished. Still the central commercial elements of time travel flashy effects monster villains star Guy Pearce and boomer nostalgia for the 1960 George Pal version will probably spur solid B.O. at home and abroad. That the present films director Simon Wells is the great-grandson of the visionary author H.G. Wells has in no way served to guarantee that the picture is faithful to the source novel. To the contrary John Logans script while preserving the books guiding conceptual notions takes great liberties otherwise transferring the initial setting from London to New York giving the time traveler a personal tragedy that motivates his desire to move back in time and entirely draining the political subtext from the futuristic conflict of the mellow above-ground Eloi and their subterranean predators the cannibalistic Morlocks. Despite their expository and downbeat nature initial 25 minutes possess a measure of charm and atmosphere that misleadingly suggest the filmmakers might be on the right track. Early scenes of Columbia U. science professor Alexander Hartdegen (Pearce) rushing about the snowy streets of New York City circa 1900 and meeting his lady love Emma (Sienna Guillory agreeably resembling a very young Jessica Lange) at a skating pond in Central Park are as redolent of Gotham period flavor as anything in ""The Age of Innocence"" from the mannerly Old World behavior of the citizens to the obvious breath emanating from the mouths of the chilly actors. After Emma is shockingly killed by a thief Alexander withdraws into four years of reclusiveness which he single-mindedly devotes to designing a device that will transport him back to the fatal night so he can save Emmas life. When fate as in an O. Henry story plays a terrible trick on the couple that convinces Alexander he cant rewrite history he decides instead to venture into the future. First stop is 2030 a time most notably marked by the info that the moon has been colonized and by the presence at the library of a spirited hologram (Orlando Jones quite amusing) who reps a one-stop repository of all human knowledge (including info on the origins of Wells novel and the existence of the Pal movie version). The warmly remembered dress shop sequence from the original showing changing womens fashions over time is recreated albeit with less charm but Alexanders next pit stop reveals disaster Due to ill-advised detonations the moon has split apart with chunks of it pelting Manhattan (one cut sequence reportedly showed the World Trade Center being hit by large moon rocks). Fleeing in desperation Alexander puts his machine into overdrive passing rapidly through long periods of arid desolation and icy waste until lurching to a stop amid lush flora and fauna in distant 802701. Nursed back to health by a friendly native Mara (Samantha Mumba) who virtually alone among her people speaks English Alexander finds himself among the Eloi who have been transformed from the placid sheeplike towheads of the novel and first film into light brown-skinned jungle dwellers who live in handcrafted cliff-hugging shells that together suggest a chic back-to-nature Polynesian compound out of ""Survivor."" The ""Planet of the Apes"" comparison becomes unavoidable when the Eloi are suddenly attacked by their ferocious enemies. Unlike the deadly but daylight-fearing Morlocks that previous generations have known and loved these toothsome creatures represent a heavily retooled variation that can move as quickly as a raptor come out whenever it wants is afraid of nothing and even uses blow darts to subdue victims. Well executed though they are these brutes just arent that creepy or original. The unarmed Alexander instantly springs into action when Mara is carted below ground where he has a climactic confrontation with the newly invented Uber-Morlock (Jeremy Irons in whiteface white-haired Goth-rock mode). This centuries-old geezer a kind of Kurtz for the ages also speaks English and extremely well at that which allows him to discourse at length with the incensed but articulate Alexander. Loathsome as he is youve got to feel a bit sorry for this overlord of the underworld as its obviously been a long time since hes had the pleasure of any civilized company. Action climax is tiresomely implausible and overblown. The closer it hews to contemporary norms and expectations of what a big-budget effects-oriented blockbuster should be the more the picture disappoints with the feeling of opportunities lost. With the exception of Jones historical riffs Logans script lacks wit; surely Alexanders passages through time could have been adorned with humorous inventions and incongruities. Shorn of its political elements tale also lacks a philosophical dimension shameful in a piece that presents such potential for same. On the performance side Pearces initial colorings of Alexander as an appealingly obsessed eccentric and crestfallen romantic all give way after his vault into the future where he becomes nothing more than a standard-issue action hero. (Curiously Pearces predecessor in the time traveler role Rod Taylor was also Australian.) Emerging Irish-born pop star Mumba shows some spunk as his Eloi savior (characters lively little brother is played by Mumbas actual brother Omero) while Mark Addy is genial as Alexanders best friend a role played in the 1960 film by Alan Young who appears briefly here as a flower vendor. Although the design of the time machine follows in the same brass-and-glass line of the original version contraption is predictably grander now. But one would have liked a little time just to behold it in all its intricate and imaginative detail before it begins whirring off to its various destinations. Other effects are accomplished but lacking in creative visions that take the breath away or make one ponder even for a moment the fate of the world. Score by erstwhile Hans Zimmer collaborator Klaus Badelt is very Hans Zimmerish. A prominent end credits thank you is given to Gore Verbinski who reportedly stepped in as director for the final month of shooting after Wells whose prior feature credit was as co-director of the animated ""The Prince of Egypt"" was overcome with exhaustion.

USATODAY.com - Waste no time on Machine Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 03/08/2002 - Updated 0907 AM ET Waste no time on Machine By Mike Clark USA TODAY The Time Machine (out of four) Stars Guy Pearce Jeremy Irons Samantha Mumba Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence New in theaters Theres nothing theoretically wrong with turning H.G. Wells The Time Machine into an even darker movie but dont blame audiences for wanting to stop the clock. Homely in all ways down to its lead actors unkempt appearance this once-intended Christmas release has been demoted to the current calendar -- and for good reason. Like director George Pals fondly regarded 1960 Machine on DVD this dud begins in the late 19th century and there are fleeting fun parallels that include a cameo by original co-star Alan Young. But director Simon Wells whose other films include the animated The Prince of Egypt and Balto manages to gut all the gee-whiz from the practically foolproof time-travel genre -- despite being H.G.s real-life great-grandson. Setting the tone of the film a gruesome personal tragedy -- which were shown twice -- motivates inventor/scientist Alexander Hartdegen (Guy Pearce) to fool with time in the first place. Piloting a machine that looks like an early-model car he makes a 21st-century stop for the movies most enjoyable bit (Orlando Jones as a know-it-all hologram) then another brief pit stop in the future so we can see how earthlings have screwed up the planet. Next our hero is 800000 years in the future when he finally hits the brakes -- as does the movie -- for the duration. What he finds is one civilization of the pursued (primitive and underdeveloped) and another of its underground Morlock pursuers (hopelessly ineffectual). As in the earlier movie life is dull when no one is fighting. Missing though is what everyone remembers from the 60 version chemistry between stars Rod Taylor and Yvette Mimieux (the one member of the community who looks like a UCLA cheerleader). In contrast Pearce and monotone Samantha Mumba never strike sparks though maybe she considers him an evolutionary throwback even to her tribe. As in The Count of Monte Cristo where his sunken cheeks fit the part Pearce looks in dire need of a trip to the health farm. Even in the early scenes when hes supposedly courting a pretty fiancee he looks as if he combs his hair daily with a can of Quaker State. Challenging Pearce in the looks department is Jeremy Irons whos sporting an aging albino look (think 70s rock star Johnny Winter at 150) thatll make you want to turn your head out of embarrassment for the actor. Irons is both ruler of the underground kingdom and the movies evil excuse to turn its climax into another dull special-effects extravaganza. No one needs this and -- in terms of the movies ugly cliff-and-cave physical setting -- no one needs a reminder of Tim Burtons Planet of the Apes whose base audience fell off as quickly as this ones will. Drab as it is the movie is not impossible to endure -- in part because the concept has a timeless appeal. Also helping is a 96-minute running time -- though in this case its still time director Wells cant find a way to speed us through with much success.

Wells classic novel By Moira Macdonald       Seattle Times movie critic ""The Time Machine""  With Guy Pearce Samantha Mumba Orlando Jones Mark Addy Jeremy Irons. Directed by Simon Wells from a screenplay by John Logan based on the novel by H.G. Wells. 96 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence. Several theaters. E-mail this article Print this article In his introduction to the current paperback version of his great-grandfather H.G. Wells classic novel ""The Time Machine"" Simon Wells writes with palpable excitement about the opportunity to make a new film version -- ""to tell an epic sweeping mythic allegory to a new audience."" Sadly enthusiasm is not quite enough nor are family connections and terrific source material and hence the new ""Time Machine"" is an occasionally engaging mess. Fans of the book may be disconcerted by the films opening sequences in which scientist Alexander Hartdegen (fumblingly played in the early scenes by Guy Pearce as if he were channeling Hugh Grant) proposes to his sweet fiancee just in time to watch her being murdered in Central Park. Distraught from grief and determined to make things right again Alexander devotes himself to inventing a time machine so that he may go back to the past and save her. When this too proves futile he travels forward in time looking for answers. Wells makes numerous odd choices in the film not the least of which was setting the action in New York rather than London and yet employing a British-Australian-Irish cast resulting in some jarring accent work. The one exception is Orlando Jones who nearly saves the film as Vox a garrulous hologram burdened with all knowledge. A scene in which he references a fictitious Andrew Lloyd Webber musical about ""The Time Machine"" (sample lyric ""Theres a place called Tomorrow ... "") comes out of nowhere but is easily the most entertaining moment of the film. Halfway through the movie the books main event kicks in. Its the year 802701 and society has evolved into a two-tier system the Eloi who live above ground and are all skimpily clad and very attractive and the dreaded below-ground Morlocks led by a gothed-up Jeremy Irons who look a bit like demented extras from ""Planet of the Apes."" Since director Wells doesnt seem very interested in exploring the class issues raised in his great-grandfathers book it all turns into your basic good-vs.-evil battle and a fairly dull one at that. Luckily Vox reappears to distract us for which we can only be grateful. Pearce currently seen in ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" has an appealing intelligence and is no hardship to watch particularly in later scenes when his hair gets mysteriously cleaner and more lush. (Apparently in the future we can look forward to really excellent hair-care products.) But as in ""Monte Cristo"" he sometimes seems to be acting all over the place lacking the control and subtlety he showed in ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Memento."" ""The Time Machine"" raises some intriguing questions about time travel and if it sends a new audience to the book (or to the 1960 George Pal film version) thats all to the good. But unlike the shiny machine at its center its timing is off and it never quite soars. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

Starring Guy Pearce Samantha Mumba and Sienna Guillory. Directed by Simon Wells. (PG-13. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Time Machine"" renders the past so beautifully that it gets the audience thinking about time travel before the subject is even raised. Theres a night scene early in the movie -- New Yorks Washington Square Park in 1899 with people milling about or taking a quiet drive in a carriage. The snow has a sepia glow evoking the photos of the period but the scene is better than any photo come to life. Its more like life come back to life. There are colors details and a vibrancy that could never be imagined from any static picture. Film is all about playing tricks with time. We watch movies filmed in the past that seem as if theyre happening in the present and that are set in the future. A longing to transcend temporal reality is the thing movie lovers and time travelers all have in common. This new version of the H.G. Wells classic before it loses its way takes that longing and pumps it up beyond anything Wells had in mind. Guy Pearce plays Alexander a physicist who wants to zigzag through time for reasons besides intellectual curiosity. On the day he gets engaged -- virtually in the minute he gets engaged -- his fiancee (Sienna Guillory) is shot to death in a holdup. He spends the next four years building the machine so he can go back to that night and avoid the dangerous part of Washington Square. Related Stories VIDEO OF THE WEEK / Unsteady Time Machine / Fine special effects dont carry flick Pearce (""Memento"") gives the physicist a singularity of focus. Hes barely in his body. Hes somewhere else. From the first time we see him scribbling away on a chalkboard the tilt of his head gives us the character -- visionary ascetic oddly endearing. Pearce a chameleon among actors is obviously giving us a certain kind of guy but heres the weird part At times it looks as if hes giving us a specific guy that hes actually imitating someone -- namely the mayor of Oakland. That an Australian actor would model a character after Mayor Jerry Brown might sound far-fetched except that Pearce even seems to have adopted a slightly husky voice for the first time in his career. This is either a homage or an uncanny accident. The picture is compelling in its first half-hour. Anyone who has ever lost a pet much less a fiancee will appreciate the characters determination to go back and change things. The emotional stakes are further heightened by the vividness of Guillory who in her brief minutes onscreen makes us believe shed be an exceptionally kind wife for this gifted fellow. But soon the movie switches gears. It stops being about a search for the past loses its emotional hook and finds nothing nearly as compelling to replace it. Movies about time travel tend to dwell too much on the future and not enough on the past. ""The Time Machine"" is no exception. Samantha Mumba an Irish pop star plays a woman our hero meets in the New York of the future but its so many ice ages into the distant future that the fun of the time- machine gimmick is lost. He might as well be on another planet. The time-travel effects are well executed. Looking out from the machine the traveler can see vegetation form flower and disintegrate in a matter of seconds. When the machine is really speeding along he can see mountains form and crumble. Simon Wells -- a great-grandson of H.G. Wells -- is mainly an animation director and his background is reflected in these moments. Still theres something wrong with a time-travel movie that allows an audiences interest to drift so that we have time to worry over where hes parked and whether he remembered to take his key.

Wells classic sci-fi novel is surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs. Although director Simon Wells incorporates some eerie low-key digital effects he doesnt offer much in the way of sweep and the production design -- if not terrible -- is uninspired. The whole thing just sort of lays there until very near the end when you really dont care anymore. Guy Pearce who plays brilliant 19th-century scientist Alexander Hartdegen mostly staggers around with a confused look on his face when he travels to a mysterious new location as if hes a tourist whos lost his way in a futuristic Worlds Fair pavilion. Considering Pearces performances in ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997) and ""Memento"" (2000) its far from his best work. And the final act is so baffling it seems like important plot points are being transmitted in code. Goofy ideas At least the opening scenes -- which recreate New York City at the turn of the last century -- look pretty good.

Wells. Guy Pearce cheekbones poking through his pale skin plays the hero of Wells science-fiction classic who climbs into his elegant handmade contraption for tripping across the centuries and tries to restore his murdered fiancee to life. After learning that he cant change destiny hes off to the future where he discovers the Eloi a native tribe locked in battle with the Morlocks the underground cannibals who have split off from the human race. Wells spun a what-if allegory of life after world war but director Simon Wells just makes the postapocalyptic jungle setting look like some Hawaiian summer-stock version of The Road Warrior.
