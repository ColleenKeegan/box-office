When Zach Galifianakiss Dr Dolittle-like miltary boffin smells a rat he sends in twitchy-nosed rodent Darwin and his cute well-equipped brethren to carry out a spot of against-the-clock espionage. Hollywoods current sheep-like insistence on releasing most kids films in 3D continues unabated with this sprog-friendly Jerry Bruckheimer chase-fest. Rugrats will probably think differently but I for one have had enough of watching fuzzy footage through stupid glasses.

The film must be aimed at the 5-10 age group. The plots technobabble went way over the head of my 8 year old as did the few reference jokes (the 12 year old wisely refused to go). For the rest it stole liberally from StormBreaker Transformers and even the Jungle Book as said 8 year old pointed out. Plodding uninspired far too violent for the age group and just not very funny.

(Walt Disney Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday July 23 2009 353 PM Title G-Force Live-action family adventure about guinea pigs who serve as spies. With the voices of Sam Rockwell Nicolas Cage Penelope Cruz. Director Hoyt Yeatman (129). PG Scary action scenes crude humor. At area theaters.If you know a 7-year-old whos still angry he wasnt allowed to see ""Transformers"" ""G-Force"" is sure to make him feel better. But other than him its hard to say who this abrasive comedy is meant to charm. Theres certainly nothing cute n cuddly about the animals in Hoyt Yeatmans frenetic 3-D mix of live-action and computerized effects. But then wed expect nothing less from producer Jerry Bruckheimer whos apparently bent on expanding his action empire into the family market. Bruckheimers films tend to feel as if they were made in a Hollywood factory and this ones no exception.The G-Force is a secret government program that is made up of highly trained guinea pigs. Because the FBI (represented by a bored Will Arnett) doesnt approve of this unusual project team leader Ben (bored Zach Galifianakis) sends his agents out undercover.Darwin (voiced by Sam Rockwell) is the leader so hes the one responsible for--well actually the plot was too complicated for this adult to fully understand. But it has something to do with an evil industrialist (Bill Nighy bored) diabolically modified household appliances and rather alarmingly a plan to perpetrate ""global extermination.""Its up to Darwin and his friends (voiced by Penelope Cruz Tracy Morgan and Jon Favreau) to save the world with a little help from a sneaky mole (voiced by Nicolas Cage).This is definitely not your parents Disney movie. Wit and magic are in short supply but there are guns soldiers car chases and explosions.What it is really is a trainer film meant to prep the worlds youngest ticketholders for the day when theyre old enough to help turn Bruckheimers bigger movies into blockbusters.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Juarez (voiced by Penelope Cruz) left and Darwin (voiced by Sam Rockwell) are secret agents. Photo DISNEY ENTERPRISES INC G-Force 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The title of G-Force a clangingly empty 3-D action comedy from Disney by way of producer Jerry Bruckheimer refers to a crack team of super-spy guinea pig commandos armed with high-tech gadgetry. ""We need a name Like Green Berets or Navy SEALs Cmon G-FORCE"" So screams Blaster a rather pushy hairball voiced by 30 Rocks Tracy Morgan. And he has a point. Impossible mission squads do require awesome nicknames whether theyre led by Tom Cruise hipster spy kids or unusually chatty rodents. But as a title G-Force just doesnt cut it. Having now seen the entire mammalian disaster I can honestly report that there is so so much more going on in this movie than just a bunch of cavys rappelling into danger. For instance We have team leader Darwin (voiced by Sam Rockwell) behind the wheel of a souped-up hamster ball (call it The Fast and the Furriest). We have Jon Favreau as Hurley a lonely pet store denizen who bonds with Darwin and watches horrified while a top-of-the-line coffee machine morphs into the appliance from hell (Transformers 3 When Cappuccino Makers Attack) We have Zach Galifianakis as the crews earnest human mentor choking with emotion as he grieves over a dead mole (Hangover II Please Somebody Tell Me I Didnt Actually Make This Movie). We have a slippery English business magnate (Bill Nighy) a variety of dim-bulb Feds (Will Arnett included) and some three-wheeled romantic tension between Darwin Hurley and a manipulative little G-Forcer named Juarez (Penelope Cruz). If thats not enough we also have a huge pyrotechnic finale set to Carmina Burana (O Fortuna The Rodent Edition). G-Forcewas written by the Wibberleys -- as in Cormac and Marianne the married duo who had a hand or four in bothNational Treasures andThe Shaggy Dog-- and directed by Hoyt Yeatman a former effects man (Underdog) making his feature debut behind the camera. But Bruckheimers paw prints are all over this movie which sports the rapid cuts and hyper-zoomed aesthetic ofArmageddon. The film is way too noisy for its own good a constant barrage of visual mayhem over-scored orchestral schmaltz and one loud pop song after another (twice with the Boom Boom Pow?). All of which would be fine in a film with no dialogue but the script is full of high-octane quippiness were all supposed to hear. Including one assumes the moment when Darwin tells Hurley to ""get your butt out of my face"" and Hurely replies ""Get your face out of my butt"" On the other hand maybe theyd better turn up the music. Do I sound cranky? I am cranky. A lot of resources went into making G-Force -- a lot of talent a lot of money a lot of marketing -- and it doesnt have much to show for it not even some half-way imaginative 3-D gimmickry. There is no reason why a movie about envelope-pushing rodents shouldnt succeed as entertainment; remember Ratatouille? If viewers believe a rat can cook we ought to have no trouble accepting Cavia porcellus as the saviors of the world. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Rubbermaid 10-Quart Ice Chest Cooler for 10 + pickup at Home...

Share Tweet In a blind taste test with all the credits and production-company logos obscured 99 out of 100 viewers will nonetheless readily--and wearily--identify both sources of breeding stock for G-Force. The film wears its origins proudly on its sleeve An awkward mating of Walt Disney Studios and Jerry Bruckheimer Films it comes packed with the formers aggressive harmlessness and the latters aggressive brainlessness. The story such as it is sends a group of CGI guinea pigs voiced by overqualified stars (Sam Rockwell Penelope Cruz and Tracy Morgan whos primarily there to chirp out catchphrases like ""Pimp my ride"" and ""Holla"") on spy adventures with a computer-expert mole (Nicolas Cage). The four are highly trained commandoes the end result of an experimental FBI-funded program run by gamely sincere scientist Zach Galifianakis. Their first (unauthorized warrantless) mission is to steal data from industrialist bad guy Bill Nighy who might be out to destroy the world with his companys smart-chipped coffeemakers and refrigerators. But glowering FBI honcho Will Arnett in full cartoonish Disney-villain mode pulls the plug on Galifianakis program. That sets off a surprisingly draggy sequence that traps the rodents in a pet-store cage along an amiable fart-machine guinea pig (Jon Favreau) and a hyper-aggressive hamster (Steve Buscemi). From there the story bangs along through a series of loosely linked action setpieces that make not a whit of sense and arent really trying to. Pointing out G-Forces plot holes would be redundant; its more hole than plot and more videogame commercial and exhausted-old-trope clearinghouse than film. Events follow each other with a sublime disregard for coherence or story continuity. (The five-screenwriter team collectively logged a lot of time on the National Treasure and Pirates Of The Caribbean movies.) At least first-time director Hoyt Yeatman--a visual-effects veteran on movies from E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial to Underdog--knows his way around CGI. The rodents look marvelously detailed and real and while Yeatman doesnt do anything unusual with the films 3-D space he produces an impressively concrete world in which live-action and digital effects are seamlessly integrated as well as utterly adorable. Its fun to look at its just a pain in the ass to watch. Even by Disney standards G-Force is harmless; apart from the anomalous 70s-movie references it feels like its pitched at 5-year-olds who might still giggle when the stars repeatedly say ""butt"" and might not notice all the moron logic. Everyone else should stand well clear. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Orphan Next Movie Review You The Living Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

(SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. July 24 2009Starring Bill Nighy Will Arnett Zach Galifianakis and the voices of Nicolas Cage Sam Rockwell Jon Favreau Penelope Cruz Steve Buscemi and Tracy Morgan. Directed by Hoyt Yeatman. 88 minutes. At major theatres. PG For those with a hamster-sized hole their hearts since Canadian TV hero Hammy Hamster quit steering boats plumbing the depths in diving bells and piloting hot air balloons along comes G-Force to plug it with high-powered guinea pig action. Disneys latest 3D extravaganza matches humans such as Bill Nighy Will Arnett and Zach Galifianakis with the cheeky rodent voices of Jon Favreau Penelope Cruz and Tracy Morgan in this mouse that roared tale. The critters get all the laughs. This is how it should be although there is something disturbing and creepy about the adenoidal voice Nicolas Cage adopts to play an IT-whiz star-nosed mole named Speckles. Although Nighy gets to air himself out as evil corporate sleaze Saber a huge disservice is done to the other humans in the cast - especially funnyman Galifianakis - who are stuck playing second banana to the furry CGI creations.Article Continued Below The G-Force is an elite squad of super g-pigs who follow the typical action-flick character profile wise and dedicated team leader Darwin (Sam Rockwell) hot-headed streetwise weapons expert Blaster (Morgan) and sexy martial arts pro Juarez (Cruz). Plus theres fly-spy Mooch who knows what the buzz is. The teams creator Ben (Galifianakis) recognizes their genius and has suited them up in wee communications headsets cool visors and weapons-laden backpacks while providing them with the latest in high-tech gadgetry and transportation. No running endlessly in a wheel for this gang. Their target is bringing down megalomaniac Saber. As in any spy film the action starts with a black-tie event at his lush lair where plans are afoot to take over the world with the help of renegade appliances. But things dont go as smoothly as fur on a guinea pigs back prompting by-the-book FBI pencil pusher (Arnett) to pull the plug on the G-Force program. A crestfallen Ben sees his superheroes carted off to the pet store where the spies are definitely out of their element. Stuck in the middle of the pet store in a big glass terrarium with a Greek chorus of dimwitted mice an overbearing territorial hamster named Bucky (Steve Buscemi) and Hurley a tubby approval-seeking guinea pig with no respect for personal space (Favreau) the G-Force team decides adoption is their only escape option. Its a plan they end up regretting. The animation on G-Force is a marvel right down to the individual hairs in the life-like fur of its stars. Scenes in which menacing appliances come to life up the excitement and may make you unplug the cappuccino maker before you go to bed but they also may rattle smaller movie fans. And this being a Disney project the story reinforces the value of family and friendship. Movie marketers are making much of the fact that ace producer Jerry Bruckheimer is behind the project and it certainly bears witness to his Pirates of the Caribbean and National Treasure Book of Secrets cred. Its his first 3D project and the usual trickery of things flying out into the audience gets amped up with a pet-store scene that made the entire theatre jump. But with all the CGI wizardry going on G-Force doesnt need 3D to make it a satisfying popcorn muncher and it sometimes feels like a needless add-on. The rodents carry the picture off in their little furry paws and this one is sure to entertain youngsters - no matter how you look at it.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

ABOUT THE MOVIE G-Force   (out of four) Stars Zach Galifianakis Bill Nighy Will ArnettVoices Nicolas Cage Penelope Cruz Sam Rockwell Tracy Morgan Steve BuscemiDirector Hoyt YeatmanDistributor Walt Disney PicturesRating PG for some mild action and rude humorRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY A goon squad of guinea pigs in eye-popping 3-D. When you think about the projects pedigree its weird but oddly inevitable. And who better to pull off such a feat than family-friendly Disney which gave us an endearing rodent culinary whiz in Ratatouille in concert with action-meister producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Pirates of the Caribbean)? The powerhouse coupling means you can count on chases and explosions plus a distinctly cute and cuddly factor. The films casting for both its in-the-flesh performances and vocal talent has some bright spots. Bill Nighy is having fun playing the villainous billionaire Saber. And the trio of guinea pigs voiced by Penelope Cruz Tracy Morgan and Sam Rockwell are lively. The script has a few funny lines. For the parents and other adults in the audience there are grown-up movie allusions. But the look of the cute computer-generated guinea pigs hamsters and mice will be the main hit with kids especially in 3-D. Zach Galifianakis is Ben a nerdy scientist. He has trained rodents to work for the federal government as accomplished spies. Not only do they talk but they also carry out espionage plots. The three guinea pigs do most of the legwork Darwin (Rockwell) is the no-nonsense leader Juarez (Cruz) is a sassy martial arts expert and Blaster (Morgan) is a weapons expert. The critter experiment is inexplicably shut down by officious federal agents (headed by Will Arnett) just as they are about to crack a case involving an appliance mogul (Nighy). World domination is at stake. Characters are broadly drawn and a few have faintly disturbing racist undertones. Its hard to know whether the trio of chirpy mice in a pet store is ripped off from the mice in 1995s Babe or simply an homage. G-Force is unlikely to keep anyone older than 10 on the edge of his seat and the bathroom humor may annoy adults. But the message of unity while unoriginal is consistently sweet.

"G-Force | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; g-force ) G-Force (United States 2009) July 23 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli I feel bad for Hoyt Yeatman. I really do although perhaps not as bad as I feel for myself for having sat through his feature debut. But heres a guy who has paid his dues. He got started way back in 1977 helping out in the special effects department for Close Encounters of the Third Kind and went on to do effects work in films crossing four decades from Star Trek The Motion Picture to Underdog. His reward for all that toiling is the chance to finally helm a feature film - and it turns out to be G-Force. If nothing else at least this gives him the opportunity to get on board the runaway popularity train that is Transformers Revenge of the Fallen. The destructive power at the end of G-Force is essentially a Transformer made out of coffee machines refrigerators and microwave ovens (instead of cars). G-Force is targeted at kids with ages in the single-digit range and it holds little of interest to anyone older. Its the template for either a video game or a Disney theme park ride or perhaps both. Yet despite this all children clearly arent enamored. More telling than the 800 words I will write about this film were the six uttered by a boy seated several rows behind me. Less than 30 minutes into this 90 minute feature he asked rather loudly ""Daddy can we go home now?"" I felt the urge to rise and give him a standing ovation. The movie opens by introducing us to Ben (Zach Galifianakis) a guy who looks like hes recovering from a hangover; his pretty assistant Marcie (Kellie Garner); and their team of four ""genetically engineered"" rodents Guinea Pigs Darwin (voice of Sam Rockwell) Juarez (Penelope Cruz) and Blaster (Tracy Morgan); and Speckles the mole (Nicolas Cage). Together with a voiceless fly they form an ""elite"" unit of the FBI the G-Force. They are in fact so elite that the FBI has decided to close them down (one assumes there were no funding provisions from them in the stimulus legislation) and at the inopportune moment when they have uncovered a plot by electronics magnate Saber (Bill Nighy) to do something dastardly to the world. Most of the movie is spent with the G-Force members eluding capture by the FBI hiding out in a pet shop giving treacly sermons about family and ultimately ending up in a showdown with a Megatron wannabe. The film is nice enough to look at although its overall appearance might have been improved without the 3-D effects (although they are generally well applied). The problem is that the extra dimension does not adequately compensate for the diminution of brightness. G-Force ends up looking bland and washed-out through the polarized glasses. I removed them a few times and was astonished at how bright and colorful everything looked. Kids of course will want to see this in 3-D because thats the ""cooler"" way to watch this sort of movie. With the exception of a few ""roller coaster"" ride moments theres not much in-your-face stuff in this movie so its not hard to surmise that the experience could be better in 2-D. As one might expect from a director who has spent so many years working in special effects the CGI is solid. The animals look as good as any animated animals and the faux Transformer is as impressive as anything that was stomping around in Michael Bays film. But beyond the visual pomp and circumstance theres not much to get excited about. The human actors - Zach Galifianakis Kellie Garner Will Arnett Bill Nighy - are props. One wonders if the movie might have worked better had they been animated. The voice work by Sam Rockwell Nicholas Cage Jon Favreau Steve Buscemi Penelope Cruz and Tracy Morgan is solid if a little bland at times. The 3-D market for kids is so hot right now that Im afraid were in for a lot more of these flashy uninspired productions. Perhaps the most dispiriting thing about G-Force is that it doesnt even pretend to contain anything for parents who have accompanied their offspring. It makes me wonder if there shouldnt be an NP-13 rating (No Patrons over 13 allowed). Ultimately this is also more about product placement than it is about enjoying the adventures of some talking Guinea Pigs Youve seen the movie now buy the toys and the video game Thats where the real money is anyway. Just ask George Lucas. G-Force like all high profiles summer releases has already targeted a particular audience - those who relish cute rodents childish humor and low-rent spectacle. For such viewers it will undoubtedly pass a litmus test. After all its not so much a bad movie as it is a pointless one and movie-goers arent exactly avoiding that sort of thing.

Stephen Cole From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jul. 23 2009 215PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English G-Force Directed by Hoyt Yeatman Written by Cormac Wibberley and Marianne Wibberley Featuring the voices of Nicolas Cage Sam Rockwell Jon Favreau Penelope Cruz Tracy Morgan and Steve Buscemi and starring Bill Nighy Will Arnett and Loudon Wainwright III Classification PG Perhaps youve heard how food engineers combine fats sugars and salts to break into the brains reward bank creating a feedback loop that fuels repeated fast-food binging. Well now like-minded film producers are going after 5- to 10-year-old boys with an equally irresistible (to this demographic) entertainment compound. G-Force  the latest from Disney has gadgetry galore blasting weapons martial arts feces jokes and an assortment of cutie-pie rodents - hamsters guinea pigs moles. Its an action-comedy. Its in 3-D. Theres a video-game tie-in. Throw in a fluorescent Slushie from the candy counter and your eight-year-old will be in heaven. The force in G-Force consists of trained secret-agent animals and insects. The paws of guinea pigs Darwin (voiced by Sam Rockwell) Juarez (Penelope Cruz) and Blaster (Tracy Morgan) are registered weapons. Nicolas Cage is typecast as Speckles the spy a star-nosed mole with an evident head cold. And theres a fly Mooch (Dee Bradley Baker) buzzing around doing surveillance. What the heck is G-Force up to? The U.S. government has hired it to spy on an evil billionaire (Bill Nighy). One of the few live actors in the kids comedy Nighy plays Bill Saber an industrialist who hopes to destroy the world with household appliances. There are subversive chips in every one of his toasters coffeemakers and phones that will on Sabers command turn them into mini-Terminators bent on global destruction. But before the G-Force can rattle Saber the government shuts the unit down relocating the agents to a pet-shop cage where they meet up with an incontinent hamster (Jon Favreau). Youre right thats where the you-know-what jokes kick in and where Darwin and Juarez begin performing a familiar preteen courtship ritual - ignoring each other in hopes of creating romantic tension. (No it doesnt work in the film either.) G-Force has a few bright spots. Will Arnett ( Arrested Development ) who plays slime balls to perfection shines intermittently as an FBI meanie. And the 3-D film does enough swooping and swirling to keep small fry feeling as if theyre leaves in a whirlwind. Which reminds us One Slushie per kid is probably a sound health precaution. Still were talking about a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced movie about superhero rodents - Hammy the Hamster on steroids. And the action-comedy isnt funny at all. A typical groaner has one of the guinea pigs racing from trouble yelling out ""I cant get these guys off my tail."" To which his co-pilot deadpans ""We dont have tails."" No taking your kid to films like G-Force isnt a fun outing not for you anyway. Its more like a parental responsibility; on an adult fun meter it would rate somewhere between a parent-teacher meeting and a trip to the orthodontist to outfit your kid with braces. Mind you given that the film is in 3-D G-Force comes with a built-in escape hatch. Those dark Roy Orbison-style glasses allow you to opt out at any time. No one will know if you close your eyes and drift off into a nap. Dont worry - your kid will wake you when its over.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review G-Force -- 2 out of 5 stars G-Force Disney Enterprises Guinea pig commandos work with the government to fight bad guys. July 24 Guinea pig commandos work with the government to fight bad guys. July 24 (Disney Enterprises) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic For parents despairing of ever tearing Cats and Dogs and Beverly Hills Chihuahua out of the family DVD player Disney gives us G-Force a comedy about talking pet-shop dropouts trained as government agents.Thanks Disney. And its in 3D too with its higher ticket price. Thanks again Kids love animal hijinx comedies so this was a no-brainer bottom-line-wise. But the digital hijinx arent great. And despite a committed voice cast that includes two Oscar winners the jokes arent all that either. And though one hesitates to use the word ""charm"" this one plainly lacks that and a few other things Beverly Hills Chihuahua had going for it. Couldnt they have used a frame or two of real guinea pigs? These animated guys are just chipmunks without the singing and the sweaters.Zach Galifianakis of The Hangover stars as a scientist who is about to lose his Homeland Security grant for turning wildlife into SPECIAL special agents. So he unleashes them on a global appliance king (Bill Nighy) who seems to have designs on world conquest. The team -- three guinea pigs a mole and a fly with cameras mounted on his chassis -- call themselves G-Force. But they dont get the goods on the bad guy. The plug is pulled on the project (Will Arnett is the FBI agent who scorns them) and the chatty critters (they have voice-decoding gadgets) are condemned to the pet shop at the mercy of little girls who want to dress them up and sadistic little boys.What will Darwin (the voice of Sam Rockwell) Juarez ( Penelope Cruz) and Blaster (Tracy Morgan) do? Why break out and prove themselves of course. Theyll bring along untrained guinea pig Hurley ( Jon Favreau) because ""We leave no rodent behind.""The jokes are of the ""Dont drop a pellet"" and flatulent rodent variety. Juarez has her own Facebook page where she muses on the nature of love. And Blaster gives the dialogue little bursts of flavor -- ""Holla""Bring the kids (they want to see it) on the condition that they NOT be allowed to ask for the DVD for Christmas and they NOT want to stop at the pet store on the way home.G-Force Two of five starsCast Bill Nighy Will Arnett and the voices of Penelope Cruz Tracy Morgan Sam Rockwell and Jon Favreau. Director Hoyt YeatmanRunning time 1 hour 29 minutesIndustry rating PG for some mild action and rude humor.

Hes so young to be typecast. It turns out though that the furry little actor plays the human adviser to ""G-Force"" a team of commando rodents equipped with spy goggles advanced communications gear and a mission to infiltrate the headquarters of a former arms dealer (Bill Nighy). The dealers goal is to build a network of household appliances implanted with smart chips that will enable the devices to communicate with each other -- or maybe take over the world. In other words heres your best opportunity yet to cross ""See guinea pigs re-enact The Dirty Dozen "" off your list of things to do before you die. The g-pigs also restage bits of ""Toy Story"" ""True Lies"" and especially ""Transformers"" as the devices go all Optimus Prime and start chomping through the scenery to a degree that suggests theyve studied the work of Nicolas Cage -- who turns up as the voice of a mole doing high-tech work for the g-team. Other voices come from Sam Rockwell (too blah) Jon Favreau and Penelope Cruz (kind of funny) and Tracy Morgan who makes the most of some so-so lines and seems destined to be the next cartoon-voice star. (How about teaming him with Jack Black? Id buy a ticket.) The guinea pigs arent the cutest or most inspired members of the Disney family (and the hamster who had a supporting role in last falls cartoon ""Bolt"" was crazier and funnier than any of the critters in this movie) but theyre amusing enough and the story has a peppy pace. Pop-culture references and one-liners pile up like so many cedar shavings. Many of the jokes involve hindquarters blasts on the part of the rodents (one of whom is even named ""Blaster"") and many are groaners (""leave no rodent behind"") but a few of them work. In a chase scene that takes him under a speeding car one guinea pig looks up and says ""He paid for undercoating? What a sucker."" Confronted by a talking guinea pig a sneering federal agent (Will Arnett) who wants to shut down the G-Force blusters ""Thats impossible"" Cruzs line is ""No. Finding something that fits off the rack -- thats impossible."" Other jokes are goofy enough to be endearing. A fly who works with the gang on their spy missions gets dejected when the mission is failing leaving Galifianakis to deliver the ""Muppet Show""-grade line ""I was so worried about you. I dont like it when my fly is down."" Thanks to an unexpected twist and a clever motivation lurking in the back story of the super-villain ""G-Force"" has enough going on to more or less maintain grown-up interest and theres plenty to please the kiddies if you can deflect inquiries about the possibility of acquiring caged rodents as pets. Now if only these long-tailed secret agents could figure out a way to take out Beverly Hills Chihuahua. G-FORCE Transformers Revenge of the furry. Running time 90 minutes. Rated PG (mild crude humor and action). At the Lincoln Square the Orpheum the Union Square others.

Starring Nicolas Cage Penelope Cruz Sam Rockwell Bill Nighy Steve Buscemi Director Hoyt Yeatman Running time 130 Release Opened Jul 24 2009  Editorial Review Dan KoisSpecial to The Washington PostJuly 24 2009A dispiriting primer on the low regard Hollywood has for the intelligence and curiosity of children -- and the time and money of their parents -- ""G-Force"" is an aggressively stupid entry in the family-adventure genre from Jerry Bruckheimer the mega-producer behind ""Bad Boys"" ""The Rock"" ""Pearl Harbor"" and other movies featuring explosions and quips.An espionage thriller threateningly billed as ""the first Jerry Bruckheimer movie in 3-D"" ""G-Force"" is a visual feast and an intellectual famine. Its rare that theres such a gulf between the care lavished on a films lustrous look and the carelessness exhibited in its perfunctory screenplay. At least ""Transformers Revenge of the Fallen"" had some strained pseudo-philosophy.The spies in ""G-Force"" are specially trained guinea pigs Darwin (voiced by Sam Rockwell) Juarez (Penlope Cruz) and Blaster (Tracy Morgan). With the assistance of a buzzing microcamera-laden fly and a tech-savvy mole (Nicolas Cage) the furry spooks of ""G-Force"" try to bring down arms dealer Leonard Saber (Bill Nighy) and save their tiny fraction of the FBIs research budget.Their handler is played by bearded comedian Zach Galifianakis who fresh off his inspired turn in ""The Hangover"" is somehow made boring here. (That a scene late in ""G-Force"" between veteran scene-stealers Galifianakis Nighy and Will Arnett passes by without incident might be the movies most inexplicable failing.)When the G-Force is disbanded and its principals are trapped in a pet shop with flatulent cage-mate Hurley (voiced by Jon Favreau) the spies must break out to foil Sabers nefarious plan for world domination.So far so good. ""G-Force"" has a cute premise and director Hoyt Yeatman a longtime visual-effects supervisor makes good use of 3-D zipping viewers through tunnels up walls and even at one point into Nighys nose. I was especially fond of the lovely way that 3-D technology makes splashing water or flying sparks appear to splatter outside the pictures frame. From homicidal robotic coffeemakers to a dazzling fireworks display ""G-Force"" is relentlessly visually inventive which makes it a real shame that its also unbearably dumb.After all we dont only love the Bruckheimer oeuvre for the explosions splendid though they may be -- we love Bruckheimer movies for the quips. And the quips of ""G-Force"" are sorely lacking. Instead of saying anything funny or surprising the guinea pigs of ""G-Force"" utter banalities and stock phrases as if the producers bought dialogue at some kind of bulk joke outlet. Morgans guinea pig suffers particularly from this problem spouting generic dated hip-hop catchphrases ""Lets take it to the house"" ""Thats off the hizzy"" ""Pimp my ride""Boilerplate like this is a poor substitute for legitimate Tracy Morgan craziness a little of which might have gone a long way toward livening up ""G-Force"" which gets most of what little comic energy it has from a series of fart jokes. Not that I have anything against fart jokes. I just wish the fart jokes were better.Like all non-Pixar childrens movies these days ""G-Force"" also tosses in a few sops for the grown-ups gags meant to make the parents in the audience nod knowingly and chuckle at the filmmakers shrugging acknowledgment that a movie like this could never interest them. In ""G-Force"" these gags mostly entail barely masked cursing (""Holy foxes"" Darwin exclaims upon seeing some foxes) or wan pop-culture references (""Yippee kay yay coffeemaker"" Darwin says while fighting a coffeemaker).By the time Darwin flattening a pursuing cars tires with a rotating saw blade shouts ""This is my little friend Say hello to it"" you realize that these references dont even rise to the level of satire. Theyre basically re-tweets from sources far more entertaining than this. The one exception is a brilliant 15-second parody of Magnetos concentration-camp origin story from ""X-Men"" -- ""Son"" a doomed father says ""if you ever have the chance to bring humans to their knees do it"" -- that made me laugh out loud.Sadly that was the only time I did. Mostly I thought about what children watching this movie would learn about storytelling that it doesnt matter that originality comes second to familiarity that jokes need not be funny to ""work."" The sheer lack of wit in ""G-Force"" is baffling; its easy to imagine a version of this high-concept adventure that features smarter characters better lines and a more coherent plot.But Bruckheimer super-producer knows hes assured of boffo box-office whether his movie is good or bad thanks to a big marketing campaign and the Disney imprimatur so hes evidently uninterested in whether its well or poorly written. Its quite possible he doesnt even know the difference.Contains some mild action and rude humor Want to go? 0 Been there? 0 Rate it 0 Share Recently Reviewed Creative Control Eye in the Sky Hello My Name Is Doris KTown Cowboys Miracles from Heaven Remember The Bronze The Confirmation The Divergent Series Allegiant The Divergent Series Allegiant The IMAX Experience Embrace of The Serpent (El abrazo de la serpiente) Knight of Cups Top G-Force Find x Showtimes x Current Location Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by Email Share on Pinterest Share on Google Plus Share on Tumblr Add to Go Out List Print 0 0 Going Out Guide Home Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Movies Trailers In Theaters Coming Soon Critics Picks Top Box Office Events Music Museums Theater amp; Dance Visitors Guide Follow Us Homepage | Sign in | Talk to Us | Newsletters Copyright (c) 2016 The Washington Post x Share on Facebook Share your Want to go and Been there lists with Facebook friends.

Because in G-Force Disneys 3D dud about a team of high-tech guinea pig spies the fate of the world hinges on who gets control of a file downloaded onto a personal digital assistant.Then again do little kids know what a good movie is?Just about the only folks likely to find this humdrum hybrid of Mission Impossible and The Wind in the Willows worthy for consideration are non-discriminating pip-squeaks happy to watch rodents rappelling walls and scampering along air ducts as the clock ticks and computer keyboards clack.Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer G-Force is thrumming with action - its an inane perpetual-motion machine of car chases (and motorized exercise ball chases) projectile kitchen appliances and yes a towering Transformers-like robot run amok. Good thing the 9-inch-tall furball action heroes are actually computer-animated. Real rodents wouldnt have lasted through the opening minutes. (Grown-ups in the audience may not either.)The Hangovers Zach Galifianakis is onboard as the human FBI guy who has whipped his crew of guinea pigs a mole and a housefly into a stealth group of animal agents - and whos under pressure from his G-men bosses (headed by Will Arnett) to scuttle the entire operation. To prove their mettle and their merit Darwin (voice of Sam Rockwell) Blaster (Tracy Morgan) Juarez (Penelope Cruz) Speckles the computer-whiz mole (Nicolas Cage) and Mooch the fly (Dee Bradley Baker) set out to expose megalomaniacal housewares industrialist Leonard Saber (the entertainingly sinister Bill Nighy). Theres something evil about Sabers cappuccino machine.And so off they go with stops in a pet shop - where they meet a goofy hamster (Steve Buscemi) - and to a neighborhood home where the guinea-pig gang are befriended by a gizmo-happy boy and a little girl who wants to play dress-up.Theres also some dangerous business with a Doberman lots of hacking-into-the-system hugger-mugger and the usual believe-in-yourself message. The script comes from the Wibberleys - thats how husband and wife Cormac and Marianne Wibberley bill themselves. The duo are aces when it comes to meaningless action Wibberleys credits include Bad Boys II Charlies Angels Full Throttle and National Treasure. The director Hoyt H. Yeatman Jr. is a veteran visual-effects maestro making his feature debut. The 3D effects are nothing to write home about - or text-message home on your PDA.

A fur-covered ""A-Team"" for the kiddies ""G-Force"" is heavy on splashy pyrotechnics and predictably light on plot. No matter This 3-D action-comedy about guinea pigs as secret agents was engineered in producer Jerry Bruckheimers nearly foolproof laboratory. Disneys spot-on marketing campaign has spawned a huge must-see factor among grade schoolers; boys will be enticed by the pics vaunted thrills and girls by the adorably realistic furballs. While adults will probably find something lacking ""G-Force"" should fast-pedal its way to a thunderously successful opening ultimately doing for fuzzy rodents what ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" did for small canines. ""G-Force"" is only the latest iteration of Hollywoods current infatuation with cute CG rodents. In the past year alone theyve gnawed the scenery in ""Bolt"" ""Bedtime Stories"" ""The Tale of Despereaux"" and even ""Chihuahua."" But ""G-Force"" takes things to a new level. Here the guinea pigs must save civilization from a dastardly appliance czar aiming for nothing less than global domination. If the script (from the husband-and-wife writing team the Wibberleys) had fleshed out that concept and managed to sustain a more charismatic villain the film might have yielded a more compelling conflict than that of skilled heroes fighting an amorphous evil. Longtime visual effects supervisor Hoyt Yeatman Jr. in his feature directing debut displays ample credentials for action and memorable setpieces. And the cast is a tyro helmers dream Zach Galifianakis fresh off his ""Hangover"" plays scientific genius (and kindly animal rescuer) Dr. Ben Kendall. Along with his girlfriend veterinarian Marcie (Kelli Garner) Ben oversees a special team of trained animal operatives. Theres Mooch a fly that transmits video data; guinea pigs Darwin (voiced by Sam Rockwell) Juarez (Penelope Cruz) and Blaster (Tracy Morgan); and a star-nosed mole (Nicolas Cage) specializing in computers. But the FBI has threatened to cut back on funding his work unless Ben can convince the agency otherwise. So in a speedy opening sequence thats little more than a showcase for some breathlessly paced action and dazzling visuals (effects include holography and CG stunts) the G-Force infiltrates the estate of suspicious coffeemaker king Leonard Saber (Bill Nighy) during a presentation on future technology. Stumbling on the entrepreneurs apparent plans to eradicate civilization via computer virus (""Operation Clusterstorm"") -- in fact Sabers motives are never really clarified -- Darwin copies the data onto a PDA and aided by his fellow agents narrowly escapes by a hair. Back at headquarters the PDA yields nothing. When the FBI administrators led by persnickety Agent Kip Killian (an underused Will Arnett) get wind of the botched infiltration they close Bens office and announce their intention to impound the animals. Having considered just this possibility Ben and Marcie release the gang into civilian life where theyll go ""undercover"" as ordinary critters residing in a pet shop until they can resume their work. The pet-shop sequence and its aftermath are among ""G-Forces"" funniest and most entertaining scenes. Forced to room with a tubby overeager guinea pig named Hurley (voiced by Jon Favreau) and a seed-hoarding hamster (Steve Buscemi) the gang face foes of the more pedestrian variety. After a little girl (Piper Mackenzie Harris) and her older brother (Tyler Patrick Jones) adopt Juarez and Blaster the rodents have to contend with overly aggressive kids whose agenda includes forcing them into battery-operated trucks and hot-pink nail polish. A delightfully rambunctious escape sequence will score big with little ones as will a clever variation on the hamster-wheel concept. But by the time the rodents are careening in their rapid-deployment vehicles through a fairgrounds as fireworks ignite a more cerebral viewer might wonder if ""G-Force"" was designed to do anything other than deliver a high-octane thrill ride with eye-popping visuals and cuddly creatures; the plot feels squarely like an afterthought. Nevertheless the pics technical aspects are beyond reproof; it moves at a rapid clip and there are enough inside jokes for action fans to elicit laughs from adults.

Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + ""G-Force represents an inconceivably tragic waste of a brilliant idea. Frankly if you cant squeeze a decent movie out of talking 3-D superagent guinea pigs - complete with itty-bitty night-vision goggles and jet-propelled grappling hooks - you may as well throw in the towel and consider a career in insurance.Yes Im talking to you producer Jerry Bruckheimer director Hoyt Yeatman writers Cormac and Marianne Wibberley and the other four (at least) uncredited writers. ""G-Force looks great moves fast and will amuse kids under 8 or so although itd help if they already had a sugar buzz on. For anyone else the goofy high concept quickly gives way to standard family flick fart gags boilerplate writing and soggy moralizing. Its a Disney co-production but its obvious no one walked down the hall to consult Pixar.The first few scenes do get your hopes up. Who wouldnt get a horselaugh from the sight of Zach Galifianakis the wild child of ""The Hangover as an FBI handler soberly discussing mission strategy with a digitally animated Cavia porcellus? The cast is high-end for this sort of thing Sam Rockwell provides the voice of team leader Darwin - a sort of Tom Cruise of guinea pigs - and Penelope Cruz and Tracy Morgan are on hand as his colleagues in action Juarez and Blaster. The great British character actor Bill Nighy plays the human villain an international appliance titan with visions of world domination.The voice of Speckles a star-nosed mole whos the teams technical guru turns out to be Nicolas Cage recycling his adenoidal whine from ""Peggy Sue Got Married. Once the G-Force has its funding revoked by a meanie FBI overseer (Will Arnett) and the characters have to hit the pavement they encounter a pet-shop guinea pig - a guinea porker really - voiced by Jon Favreau. His cage-mate is the funniest character in the movie a weaselly little hamster played by Brooklyns finest motormouth Steve Buscemi.(Heres a game I play by the way When actors I generally respect show up in one of these silly summer behemoths I always wonder if they have college-age kids. Youd be surprised how often they do. Buscemi does and tuition isnt getting any cheaper.)The problem with ""G-Force is that its creativity and thus its entertainment value doesnt extend an inch beyond the initial idea. The story line is a mishmash of every ""Mission Impossible cliche in the playbook and once the novelty of seeing them acted out by tiny furry hyperrealistic cartoon characters wears off its like watching a Xerox of a Xerox.This despite the usual Bruckheimer indulgences high-speed chase scenes random explosions flatulence. The script which feels committeed to death has a little bit of everything including a ""Transformers rip-off sequence and many occasions for the urban slang Morgan mangles so smartly on ""30 Rock. Here it just sounds like pandering. Director Yeatman making his feature debut after a successful career as a visual effects expert busies himself with the digital rendering (which is very well done) and as many in-your-face 3-D shots as he can muster. ""G-Force is the opposite of Pixars ""Up in this regard; if its not comin at ya its not worthy of our attention.Despite this the movies an enervating experience. You can take the whole family; I did. We all found ourselves dozing off at points snapping back to attention only during the enjoyably dippy dance-happy end credits. And this from a clan predisposed to like any and all movies featuring talking rodents. The general consensus on this one Rats.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.
