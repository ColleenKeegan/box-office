Starring Jason Biggs Chris Klein Thomas Ian Nicholas and Eddie Kaye Thomas. Directed by Paul Weitz. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""American Pie"" is a teen sex comedy that gets it right. It casts actors who look plausible and treats sex with honesty and no apologies. The honesty keeps this ribald comedy which opens today from being distasteful. The phony stock characters found in every other teen comedy arent here. There are no football players going to bed with a different cheerleader every night. There are no virtuous young fellows passing up sexual opportunities for vague moral reasons. These guys are teenagers after all. They dont get many opportunities to pass up. Related Stories `Pie a Slice of Reality / Warm teen comedy avoids stereotypes The premise of the film sounds like that of every other movie set in a high school Four young fellows approaching graduation resolve to lose their virginity on or before prom night. It has to be ""valid consensual sex. No prostitutes."" What distinguishes ""American Pie"" is the way the story is told. In addition to being extremely funny the film has a warm spirit and respect for the characters. For once this warmth extends to the young women in the movie. Theyre not typed as saints bimbos or objects of ineffable mystery but as fellow humans going through a similar period of turmoil and adventure. Its the fairness and knowingness of Adam Herzs script and the sure- handedness of Paul Weitzs direction that makes ""American Pie"" something for adults to enjoy. Of course the appeal for teenagers is obvious and the R rating is sure to test the ability of theaters to keep unaccompanied young people out. In this case the vigilance might be a bit misplaced. On this subject 16- year-olds know the score as well as their parents do. Jason Biggs has the funniest role as Jim who is both easily aroused and terrified of girls. He steels himself to approach a girl at a party but all he can manage is nervous laughter. The picture provides Jim with a succession of painful humiliations -- including a long delightful and embarrassing scene in which his fumbled escapades are accidentally sent out over the Internet. Chris Klein (""Election"") plays a lacrosse jock who joins the glee club to meet girls. Thomas Ian Nicholas is Kevin the only one of the quartet to have a girlfriend (Tara Reid). The matter-of-factness with which girlfriend and boyfriend talk about taking the final step -- while routinely doing everything else but -- has the ring of truth. ""American Pie"" consistently gets the details right -- details most adults in the audience will have forgotten since high school. For example when the four virgin guys find out that a nerdy friend has lost his virginity before they have their conception of their place in the universe is diminished. They feel as they might 20 years later if an underling got promoted over them. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who rounds out the quartet is the quietest of the fellows but the most scheming. He hires one of the girls at school to start rumors about him that exaggerate his prowess and talk him up as a tough guy. In a less honest picture the movie would eventually contrive to hook Finch up with the girl he hired (Natasha Lyonne). But these filmmakers apparently remember high school and understand that these characters are at an age when friendship doesnt lead to dating but to brotherly and sisterly feelings that make dating impossible. Though it follows the journeys of each of the four guys ""American Pie"" never has a start-and-stop feeling but is all of a piece. The movie is filled with great bits that are not worth ruining by explaining them. And then theres that thing with the pie. But be on the lookout for Alyson Hannigan who almost steals the picture as a ""band geek"" and Jennifer Coolidge as a sexy middle- aged mom who drinks single-malt scotch ""aged 18 years. Just the way I like it.""

In one of the many scenes that young moviegoers will surely be snickering about all summer Jim (Jason Biggs) a hapless putz who looks like a junior David Schwimmer watches via an Internet video hookup as the Eastern European exchange student (Shannon Elizabeth) he has invited over for a ""study session"" lies naked on his bed and proceeds to pleasure herself to a skin magazine. The scene is pure (or should I say impure) hormone-soaked farce. The girl who in the 60s would have been a Norwegian stewardess takes off her top to reveal a pair of extremely enhanced-looking torpedoes. Nevertheless when Jim pops into the room this porno-foldout bunny surprises him and the audience by taking control. She orders him to strip too and then she makes him dance. He does in a series of spectacularly grotesque gyrations. In that moment he becomes the very thing he was pining for -- a piece of meat on display -- and it was then when the movie had shot past pseudo-exploitation and into the comedy of sexual role reversal that I began to laugh. Most of the current crop of teen hits like Shes All That or Never Been Kissed have in essence been John Hughes nostalgia vehicles complete with jocks nerds princesses and makeovers. American Pie doesnt have very memorable characters (many of the actors look bland enough to star in a sitcom based on the movie) but it does have a new spirit a frank yet sweet-souled randiness. Its pitched to the first generation of male and female adolescents who have been taught from birth (mostly by MTV) to act as sex objects for each other and thats one reason that girls I think will flock to this movie as readily as boys. For them it can represent a novel form of voyeurism an amiable peep-show glimpse into the outrageousness of the male mind. Even the exuberantly smutty sequence in which Jim uses a home-baked apple pie as a substitute for what hes craving is like a pop encapsulation of the most famous scene in Portnoys Complaint. Instead of launching a laborious scheme to get laid the heroes fumble in awkward funny sometimes touching ways. Chris Klein so winning as the inarticulate jock candidate in Election here plays a lacrosse star who joins the choir to win the attentions of a square-peg babe (Mena Suvari). Yes hes learning to ""work the sensitive angle"" but as the film portrays it hes also caught between worlds. Jim is merely caught in his masturbatory fantasies; he endures hilariously mechanical lectures on auto-stimulation from his 50s-style dad (Eugene Levy) and then gets lured into that Internet broad- cast which results in the entire school seeing his cup runneth over (twice). The bow-tied Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) has quite literally the biggest reputation around but beneath his quizzical demeanor hes so preoccupied with an even lower bodily function that hes barely in the game. Like most good teen comedies that never quite transcend their B-movie roots (Fast Times at Ridgemont High Valley Girl) American Pie is a lively disposable hybrid of the sincere and the synthetic. The films stray gross-out gags feel as if they were slapped together in the wake of Theres Something About Mary (a nasty spiked beer sits just waiting to be sipped) and some of the more charming characters are pure cartoon-ville like the nerd (the scene-stealing Alyson Hannigan) who cant talk about anything but band camp yet turns out to be even lustier than her prom date. It reflects a major shift in contemporary teen culture that the girls in American Pie are as hip to sex as the boys. One of them played by the acerbic Natasha Lyonne whos like a naughtier Chelsea Clinton is actually too experienced to exist within her school circle. Shes waiting for everyone else to catch up. Sexually speaking playing catch-up is what being a teenager is all about and movies like American Pie are by now an essential part of the ritual.

This cheesy homage to horniness will be a dream movie for many a teenage boy so thoroughly does it exploit the comic possibilities of randy adolescence and the desperate urge to score. A film with a one-track mind ""American Pie"" has but a single ambition -- to be the king of gross-out comedy -- and will happily wear that crown until another film sets out to steal it say around this time next year. Crude in more ways than one this cheesy homage to a level of horniness Austin Powers could only imagine will be a dream movie for many a teenage boy; so thoroughly does it exploit the comic possibilities of randy adolescence and the desperate urge to score. Crucially however and unlike the leering ""Animal House""-""Nerds"" sex farces of yore pic gives ample time to the female p.o.v. which will translate into plenty of extra coin for this ultra-commercial Universal release which will be the must-see comedy for auds in their teens and early 20s throughout the mid-summer. But somewhat older viewers who embraced last summers comparable but infinitely more creative film ""Theres Something About Mary"" are likely to feel more out of the loop with this one. Credited to a single screenwriter first-timer Adam Herz but feeling much more like the result of a bunch of guys sitting around topping each other with the most outrageous sex shenanigans they can think of pic gives an idea of whats to come with a teaser sequence in which high schooler Jim (Jason Biggs) is caught by his parents pleasuring himself in a tube sock while watching a porno tape. The nothing-fancy just-get-to-the-point approach continues throughout and follows neatly off the simple premise Four semi-out-of-it seniors sick of their virginity and determined not to carry their burden with them to college resolve to divest themselves of their innocence by the time they graduate in three weeks -- and it has to be for real not purchased. In addition to Jim whos something of an oaf of no particular distinction the buddies include Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) who looks to be in the best position to get over since hes already reached third base with his blond g.f. Vicky (Tara Reid); skinny Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) who has no apparent prospects and Oz (Chris Klein) whose advantageous great looks and jock status are mitigated by an underlying propriety and shyness. Galled by claims of sexual conquest by their dweeby pal Sherman (Chris Owen) the guys feverishly devote themselves to their task. Kevin quickly studies up on oral sex in order to break down whatever defenses Vicky has left against going all the way the word is spread around school that shrimpy Finch is decidedly unshrimpy where it counts and Jim places all his chips on his chances with an exotic Czech student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth); a slapstick bedroom encounter between these two which is witnessed by the entire student body via computer is a particularly wild comic highlight. For his part Oz unexpectedly falls for an appealing but prim-looking girl Heather (Mena Suvari) who sings in glee club and finds himself going to surprising lengths to win her over. It all comes down of course to prom night and films climactic 20 minutes are devoted to the sometimes very funny but conventionally satisfying ways in which all the characters -- men and women -- end up getting what they want or need. At every turn you can sense Herz and tyro director Paul Weitz who wrote last years ""Antz"" with brother Chris who co-produced here trying to figure out how they can one-up films that have come before and set new standards of vulgar hilarity. Last years semen in the hair has been replaced by semen in someones beer the unwitting e-mail sex (the only scene featuring nudity) is an elaboration of the Hot Lips loudspeaker scene in ""MASH"" and a delightfully unanticipated older woman-younger man encounter tips the hat to ""The Graduate."" Film succeeds in its elementary mission due to its relentless bluntness and fundamental realism about teenage human nature. The brazen no-b.s. attitude about whats on everyones minds will give it major scoreboard with its intended audience and the multi-faceted ending pleases in the way it begins leaving the obsessions of high school behind and looks ahead to a more interesting future. Largely no-name cast is game and gamey. Klein discovered in ""Election"" stands out once again here as the sensitive stud; hunkier and even better looking than Keanu Reeves the guys got ""movie star"" written all over him and his open fun personality makes him like Gary Cooper the rare female heartthrob that guys love to watch too. Suvari brings an unconventional charm to the role of his observant g.f.; Alyson Hannigan is a scene-stealer as the chatty apparent dim bulb with whom Jim hooks up for the prom; Natasha Lyonne gets good mileage out of her few scenes as the advice-dispensing most experienced girl in school; and Elizabeth will set thousands of boys drooling as the statuesque Euro who could no doubt teach the whole graduating class a few tricks. Set in Michigan but shot mostly around Long Beach film is technically very low end except for the jam-packed soundtrack of 30-plus tunes. At the screening caught with a recruited audience theater house lights were ruinously kept on at a very bright level during unspooling to accommodate videotaping of audience reactions until repeated complaints finally caused them to be turned down then off.

Sound familiar? Yes and no Todd Stephens ""Another Gay Movie"" adds a new twist to ""American Pie"" The boys -- and just about everyone else -- are gay. Its a goofy over-the-top-and-then-some Technicolor spoof in which the boys live in Brady Bunch-style homes and share dreamy fantasies about the likes of Richard Hatch. (Yes Richard ""Survivor"" Hatch. Yes hes in the movie. No he cant act at least not by this evidence.) Movie review Showtimes and trailer""Another Gay Movie"" with Michael Carbonaro Mitch Morris Jonathan Chase Jonah Blechman Ashlie Atkinson Scott Thompson. Written and directed by Todd Stephens. 90 minutes. Not rated; contains sexuality and nudity (no one under 18 admitted). Varsity through Thursday. To say that this body-fluids-drenched romp is about as good as ""American Pie"" is certainly damning with faint praise but at least you can say that ""Another Gay Movie"" meets its modest goals. And you can imagine if you care to plenty of unsung heroes behind the scenes such as the sound technicians creating all those bathroom noises and the properties person in charge of creating all those fluids. (Theres a re-creation of the prom scene in ""Carrie"" -- and its not pigs blood they dump.) The actors are beside the point though Jonah Blechman (as Nico) has a manic perkiness; its as if all his sentences have carefully drawn exclamation points. Stephens screenplay in the style of ""Scary Movie"" and its ilk is more a series of comedic moments rather than a narrative. Much of it is predictable but funny moments twinkle through such as a pair of dancing gay paramedics and Andys mom (played by the drag queen Lypsinka) suspiciously eyeing the wire hangers in his closet. Whats most appealing about this movie is its cheerful matter-of-factness about its subject and its agreeable message that sex-starved teens gay or straight have a lot in common. ""American Pie"" wasnt for everyone and ""Another Gay Movie"" isnt either but its presence at the arthouses is a small soggy step forward.

"American Pie | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; american-pie ) American Pie (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli With American Pie its a case of the reality of the situation being dwarfed by the hype. Word of mouth has this pegged this as the most raunchy movie of the summer - a film that embraces taboos and pushes the limits of the MPAAs R rating (indeed before three rounds of cuts it was given an NC-17). However while the movie is rude crude and lewd it doesnt break any new ground. Its least palatable moment (involving a beer-and-bodily fluid cocktail) is no worse than a similar instance from the PG-13 Austin Powers sequel. Its most outlandish scenes do not surpass envelope-stretching sequences from 1998s Theres Something About Mary and Happiness. In fact when it comes to being offensive it has to take second place to another currently-playing theatrical release. No one will debate that American Pie has an edge but its not as sharp as that of South Park. The point of every gross eccentric and vulgar moment in American Pie is to make the audience laugh. First time director Paul Weitz and writer Adam Herz arent going for anything remotely intellectual here - theyre appealing to the least common denominator in us all. And it works. American Pie is consistently funny and sporadically hilarious. It should come as a surprise to no one that the most effective jokes involve some form of sex (including but not limited to intercourse masturbation fellatio and cunnilingus). Theres also one instance of (literal) toilet humor that had the audience in stitches. American Pie descends into bad taste with its first scene and has the good sense never to rise above that level. A comparison to Theres Something About Mary is especially apt. Not only do the two movies offer similar flavors of comedy but like Mary American Pie has an unexpectedly sweet romantic backstory. The movie isnt all about shocks and gross-out humor; it takes the time to develop a few characters who while admittedly not the most three-dimensional individuals to grace the screen are likable and worth caring about. That aspect of this film is being missed by those who are calling it the ""Porkys of the 90s."" The only significant traits shared by American Pie and Porkys are that theyre both members of the teen sex comedy genre and neither will be endorsed by conservative movie-goers. For while Porkys was an exploitation flick loaded with gratuitous sex and nudity that served no purpose whatsoever American Pie is an exploitation flick loaded with gratuitous sex and nudity that serves a specific purpose keeping viewers rolling in the aisles. American Pie introduces us to a quartet of males with a serious problem their high school senior year is coming to a close and theyre all virgins. Jim (Jason Biggs) the films ostensible hero is an awkward guy who has trouble talking to females. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) the most average member of the group is involved in a stable relationship with a beautiful girl but he keeps stranding runners at third base. Oz (Chris Klein) a dumb jock decides that the best way to meet members of the opposite sex is to join the glee club. And Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas) the intellectual is so tightly wound that he wont use the school restrooms. The egos of these four are badly bruised when evidence suggests that the biggest geek at East Great Falls High has had sex before them. So they make a pact to help each other lose their virginity before they graduate and target one specific event the Senior Prom. Each of the guys is ultimately paired with a girl. For Jim its an oversexed exchange student named Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) and when that falls through its Michelle (Alyson Hannigan) a timid member of the school band. Oz falls for smart pretty Heather (Mena Suvari) who generally has little time for jocks. Kevins steady girlfriend is Vicky (Tara Reid) whose best friend Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) encourages her to ""do it."" And Finch learns why The Graduate is such a popular movie. Without going into many details its worth mentioning a few of the comic highlights. Some of the best scenes in American Pie involve the father-son chats between Jim and his dad (Eugene Levy in peak form). Levys deadpan matter-of-fact approach plays perfectly as his character relates the facts of life to his acutely embarrassed son. Dad doesnt just explain the birds and the bees; he brings along a few visual aids (including a copy of Hustler and a magazine called Shaved). And when it appears that Jim may finally be getting close to scoring Dad is all thumbs-up and encouragement. Another high point involves a 90s variation of looking through the peephole. When Jim learns that an attractive girl may end up changing clothes in his bedroom he sets up a digital camera to capture the action and broadcast it to an Internet site that only he and a few friends will know about. Of course nothing goes as planned and hilarity ensues. While few in the audience will recognize it crisp editing plays a large part in building comic momentum during this sequence. Finally theres the post-prom party where everyone gets (or tries to get) what they want. While American Pie doesnt go for unbridled laughter during these scenes (two comic tete-a-tetes are intercut with two romantic ones) some of the material is exceptionally funny even if it is a little predictable. Of course to dilute any potentially serious subtext Weitz throws in a significant dose of outrageousness as the movie soars to its climax. For the cast Weitz has snagged a group of largely unknown actors. A few of them tickle the memory with that ""I think Ive seen him/her somewhere before"" but aside from Natasha Lyonne (The Slums of Beverly Hills) and Eugene Levy there arent any prominent names. And while no one in American Pie appears poised on the brink of superstardom everyone fills their roles adequately. Jason Biggs makes Jim an affable sympathetic figure Chris Klein (Matthew Brodericks candidate in Election) conveys Oz sensitive side and Tara Reid (Urban Legend) exhibits some low wattage sex appeal. The main difference between American Pie and most of the other teen-themed comedies flooding theaters these days is the take-no-prisoners edge. This film isnt going for ""cute."" Its not trying to earn a PG-13 for maximum exposure to the under-17 crowd. It takes risks; they dont always work but when they do theres a payoff. And aside from Election (and perhaps the inept Cruel Intentions) no recent movie set in a high school has been this frank about sex. Theres nothing obtuse about the films appeal. For those who think the moral level of Hollywood pictures is in a steep decline American Pie provides evidence to support the theory. For just about everyone else its a guilty (or in some cases a not-so-guilty) pleasure.
