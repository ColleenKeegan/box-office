Marred by an overbearing and insufficiently tight conclusion that detracts from the otherwise convincing and engaging premise movie is ideal fest and cable fare. A North American subset of the ""Rashomon"" principle is alive and reasonably well in ""The Falling"" an ominous willfully stylish and aggressively contempo pic about a woman and two of the men in her life. Marred by an overbearing and insufficiently tight conclusion that detracts from the otherwise convincing and engaging premise movie is ideal fest and cable fare. Pic examines the conversations sexual encounters and rivalries between hip independent businesswoman Karis (Nicole Oliver) Lars (Christopher Shyer) the record exec she picks up in a club and Morgan (Rob Lee) her former main man. Viewers sympathies are toyed with in a carefully calibrated series of emotional showdowns layered to prove that theres no such thing as objective reality in affairs of the heart. Told in subjective chapter-headed sections from the point of view of each player film starts with a segment called ""Lars"" replays the same events with crucial variations in ""Morgan"" and retraces the same territory with tell-tale differences in ""Karis."" Karis platonic friend and sounding board Simon (John Cassini) illuminates the tale in yet other ways. In ""Lars"" Morgan looks and acts like a hardnose with attitude to spare; in ""Morgan"" hes a wounded pussycat. Is he a romantic pining for Karis or is he a deranged stalker? Is Karis a mercenary bitch with an aggressive bedroom style or is she a reasonable and sensitive woman trying to get on with her professional and love lives? Is Lars a dreamboat or a nightmare? Dramatically-lit story awash in threatening overtones takes place mostly at night or in enclosed spaces with sinister sound design keeping things edgy. Thesps juggle the varying tones with skill with special praise for Oliver. The Falling(DRAMA -- CANADIAN) ProductionA Sodona Entertainment presentation with participation of Telefilm Canada.

As shot by cinematographer Robert Richardson in Scott Hicks busy yet inert adaptation of David Gutersons 1994 bestseller its a landscape you want to gaze at as you would a museum masterpiece--by tuning out the world around you. For better or worse you can do just that while watching this exceedingly blurred rendering of a simply told artful novel; Hicks in his first post-Shine project meanders so fitfully between scenes and time frames that he leaves all too much time for eyes (and thoughts) to wander. The director and the prolific Ron Bass (The Joy Luck Club Waiting to Exhale) collaborated on the screenplay which describes the complicated relationship between Washingtons Anglo- and Japanese-Americans Time shifts between the 1950s when Kazuo Miyamoto is on trial for the murder of a white fisherman and the 1940s when thousands of local Japanese-Americans were herded into internment camps following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. And bridging the two unhappy chapters is the thwarted love affair between Hatsue (Youki Kudoh) -- now married to Kazuo -- and local boy Ishmael (Ethan Hawke) now a hard-shelled journalist. But how can Hicks be two places at once when hes not anywhere at all? Hawke scrunches himself into such a dark knot that we have no idea who Ishmael is or why he acts as he does but we have all too overblown an image of Ishmaels newspaperman father (Sam Shepard) as a virile idealist. It takes forever to learn the facts of Miyamotos case but it takes a minute to realize that as his wheezing old lawyer Max von Sydow is a crusted ham. As snow falls and falls and continues to fall between flashbacks of young Ishmael and Hatsue in more innocent days there is little to do but admire the scenery. And for that why sit in the dark?

Starring Ethan Hawke Youki Kudoh and Rick Yune. Directed by Scott Hicks. Written by Ron Bass and Scott Hicks. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At the AMC Kabuki AMC Van Ness and Metreon.) ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" the film version of the David Guterson best- seller is a beautifully mounted film that re-creates the Pacific Northwest of 1950. Filtered through opalescent light the fictitious San Piedro Island has a storybook quality -- a place where random acts of fate occur and the mysteries of human nature are clouded by snow and fog. Directed by Scott Hicks (""Shine"") and photographed by Oliver Stones ace cinematographer Robert Richardson ""Cedars"" which opens today may be the most meticulously designed film of the year. Its images are breathtaking and reverential like the best of Ansel Adams nature photography. Its too bad then that ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" is so plodding and self-serious. The story of a murder trial that divides a small towns Anglo and Japanese American communities ""Cedars"" never brings the viewer inside the Japanese American experience -- even though its primary aim is to strip the facade off anti-Asian bias and make a plea for racial tolerance. Rick Yune plays Kazuo Miyamoto an immigrants American-born son accused of murdering an Anglo fisherman. ""Cedars"" might have some bite had it concentrated on Kazuos struggle -- the dead mans family had burned him on a land deal which makes him the prime suspect -- but instead were shown an extensive back story involving his wife Hatsue (Youki Kudoh) and her adolescent passion for Ishmael Chambers a white news reporter played by Ethan Hawke. Hicks and screenwriter Ron Bass (""The Joy Luck Club"") mix time frames interweaving the trial Ishmael and Hatsue as children and as teens the incarceration of Hatsues family during the war and Ishmaels relationship with his father (Sam Shepard) an idealistic newspaperman who fought anti-Japanese racism. This is the filmmakers way of drawing connections between Pearl Harbor the internment of Japanese Americans and the bias that Kazuo suffers on trial -- a bias so readily accepted by the fishermen and berry farmers of San Piedro Island that the use of the word ""Jap"" goes unquestioned. One of the themes of Gutersons book is the cultural gap between Anglo Americans and Japanese Americans the difference between a people who favor blunt emotion and another who withhold feelings and place a higher value on dignity and grace. ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" doesnt focus on those distinctions and the misunderstanding that results nor does it examine the cultural roots of Kazuos stoic demeanor in the courtroom -- a demeanor that makes him seem cold in the eyes of his accusers. Instead ""Cedars"" focuses on a tough prosecuting attorney (James Rebhorn) a liberal defense attorney (Max von Sydow) and the near-angelic journalist (Hawke) who quietly collects evidence to protect the accused. Kazuo remains a cardboard figure -- as much a mystery by films end as he was at the start. Hollywood has a habit of glorify ing the white guy when it tries to dramatize racial divisions. ""Cry Freedom"" a portrait of South African political martyr Steven Biko became a paean to a white journalists courage and in ""Amistad"" Steven Spielberg never pierced the surface of his African slave mutineers but saluted the white attorneys who defended them. The saving grace of ""Cedars"" is Richardsons rich and graceful photography. Using a subdued winter palette of grays and silvery whites his work is gorgeous -- an about- face from the hyperkinetic style he uses for Stones films. Hicks put tremendous care into the look of ""Snow Falling on Cedars"" but ultimately theres something too measured too controlled in his film. One gets the feeling that the actors had to wait for hours for the perfect light and cloud formations. Thats great for still photography but it can enervate a film. A film needs spontaneity not perfection. It needs life. ..

""Snow Falling on Cedars"" is an impeccably crafted but dramatically dull adaptation of David Gutersons international bestseller. Draped in the heavy moist atmosphere of its Pacific Northwest location circa 1950 and haunted by a naturalistic quietude bespeaking deep secrets Scott Hicks Hollywood follow-up to his 1996 debut ""Shine"" becomes tediously digressive in its second half and hits nothing but extremely familiar notes concerning its dominant themes of prejudice racial inequity lost love and self-doubt. Books fan base and strong reviews from some mainstream critics may be enough to give this a good launch commercially but lack of marquee names and pics somber lugubrious self-important nature forecast a limited B.O. life upon Christmas release. Fancily structured film mixes the melodrama of a murder trial with flashback slices of poignant romantic memory and angst as small-town newspaperman Ishmael Chambers (Ethan Hawke) is slowly revealed to be far from an impartial observer of the courtroom drama. Intent of the yarn is to reveal the full sociopolitical fabric of a very American yet ethnically mixed community during the now-idealized post-World War II period but the script by Hicks and Ron Bass follows a yawningly predictable course in the area of social observations and the handling is so precious and restrained as to sink the film from lack of momentum. Darkly impressionistic opening depicts a nighttime boating incident in which a local fisherman is found dead in the wintry waters off San Piedro Island in Washington. There is little hard evidence but Kazuo Miyamoto (Rick Yune) a handsome young Japanese-American and a childhood friend of the deceased Carl Heine Jr. (Eric Thal) is charged with murder. The arrest and ensuing trial which starts on the ninth anniversary of Pearl Harbor revive painful memories that have barely begun to heal regarding the treatment of the islands long-established Japanese-American community. The trial in which hard-driving prosecutor Alvin Hooks (James Rebhorn) is pitted against elderly Old World defense counsel Nels Gudmundsson (Max von Sydow) under the sternly evenhanded Judge Fielding (James Cromwell) serves as a springboard for innumerable flashbacks. The most vibrant of these recount the illicit teenage love affair between Kazuos wife Hatsue (Youki Kudoh) and Ishmael Chambers the sensitive son of Arthur Chambers (Sam Shepard) editor of the local paper. Appealingly played as kids by Anne Suzuki and Reeve Carney Kazuo and Ishmael take to meeting in a secluded grove of cedar trees and while the former is typically warned by her traditional mother ""Stay away from white boys -- marry one of your own kind"" the couple gradually progress from special friendship to forbidden passion. At the same time pic sketches in the pre-war social order of the island where the Japanese lived in relative harmony with the mostly German and Scandinavian white families. But a possible motive for the central murder is established by tracing Kazuos lingering anger over a betrayal by Heines mother who used the wartime internment of Japanese as an excuse to terminate his familys purchase of some farm land. These fundamental details leading up to forced departure of the Japanese to Manzanar are enumerated with fastidious dispatch through the films first hour during which one can take deep satisfaction in the extraordinary images Hicks and cinematographer Robert Richardson are putting on the screen. Composed and lit with an uncommon exactitude the widescreen visuals possess a burnished density and gain further distinction from being strategically drained of much of their color in the interest of monochromatic splendor; its a modern much more advanced version of the sort of color scheme John Huston and lenser Oswald Morris experimented with on ""Moby Dick"" more than four decades ago. Despite the subsequent augmentation of atmospherics via a snowstorm and a power outage that requires the trial to proceed by candlelight pic slips into a ditch in the second half. Hicks dawdles on the ugly resolution and fallout of the Hatsue-Ishmael romance in the past and on Ishmaels boring hesitation to step forward with information pertinent to the trial due to his unresolved bitterness over Hatsue. All the back-and-forthing becomes wearying and as the trial chugs toward a climax one wants to stick with it rather than continually being jerked back into the past. Ending trades in pat notions about developing the maturity to accept certain things as they are and move on. Acting is mostly of the solidly earnest stripe but the inner lives of the characters are seldom illuminated. Hawke once again proves to be a listless stolid leading man with little energy and nothing going on behind his eyes. Kudoh is rather more engaging as the conflicted Hatsue while pros such as Cromwell Rebhorn and Richard Jenkins as an ineffectual local cop deliver their expected good work. By far the most delightful member of the cast is von Sydow who now looks like a beautifully aged carved statue and has a great time providing intelligent and wryly hammy nuances to his characterization. James Newton Howards churning score goes overboard into emotional excess at times. But along with Richardsons spectacular work other artistic contributions notably Jeannine Oppewalls production design and Renee Erlich Kalfus costume design are of the highest order and bolster the intense and perhaps deliberately overbearing sense of time and place. Bainbridge Island B.C. locations are spectacularly evocative. Snow Falling on Cedars(PERIOD DRAMA) ProductionA Universal release of a Harry J. Ufland Ron Bass and Kennedy/Marshall production.
