"Clint Toes The `Line - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movie review.Clint Toes The `LineHes Not Going To Let Another President DieJuly 09 1993|By Clifford Terry.Guilt. What would Hollywood do without it? Earlier this summer mountaineer Sylvester Stallone was literally and figuratively hung up over a climber who fell to her death. Now comes Clint Eastwood as a veteran Secret Service agent who has been full of remorse ever since John Kennedy was gunned down on his watch.Characterized as JFKs favorite agent Frank Horrigan broods that he didnt react in time and throughout ""In the Line of Fire"" agonizes over his ""demons"" and whether he could ""take a bullet."" In the years after that November afternoon-he is shown in Dallas via clever ""Zelig""-like special effects-his wife and daughter leave him the Warren Commission criticizes him and Horrigan turns more and more to drink. At one point in the film he sardonically describes himself as ""a living legend-the only active agent who ever lost a president.""He gets his chance for redemption when after saving his new young partner (Dylan McDermott) while on a close-to-the-edge counterfeiting case he learns there is a professional killer out there who plans to kill the current chief executive. Horrigan promptly volunteers for the presidential detail.Calling himself ""Booth"" the would-be assassin is played by John Malkovich who has caught a role made in hell and particularly made for an actor with beady eyes a creepy demeanor and a whiny voice. (As he and Eastwood engage in a series of phone conversations it thus comes down to the whine versus the rasp.)At first we just see those eyes and that distinctive mouth but thats enough. Then come the hands and nose and eventually the whole man and his dark scheme. Cunning and intelligent Booth is a gadget freak who manipulates the phone system then builds his own ""Mr. Wizard""-like weapon of destruction. Subtly changing expressions as the movie progresses Malkovich pulls out all the vocal and visual tricks learned at Chicagos Steppenwolf Theatre Company-which sometimes have been too much but which work quite well here.Slipping in and out of disguises Booth keeps popping up in cities where the president-running hard in an election year-makes a series of public appearances. Before the movie reaches its tidy denouement in Los Angeles the agent has twice reacted too hastily (once leading to the presidents national humiliation). In the key scene he faces down Booth in a confrontation over morality as well as survival.The benchmark for assassination movies is ""The Day of the Jackal"" Fred Zinnemanns crisp finely tuned 1973 adaptation of the Frederick Forsyth best seller about a plot to kill Charles de Gaulle. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot"" ""Shattered"") from a script by Jeff Maguire ""In the Line of Fire"" doesnt come close. In fact it would be a rather routine thriller except for the presence of Eastwood the lion in summer.The actor who has specialized in playing squinty-eyed loners is now seemingly grounded as a gray-suited out-of-shape team player hanging out in piano bars and using words like ""cockamamie."" But his change in persona makes no difference. Eastwoods performance gives the whole thing a heft and a dignity as the filmmakers wisely play off his characters strength and self-deprecation and-not so incidentally-age.When Frank Horrigan paints himself as ""a borderline burnout with questionable social skills"" you believe him. When he says to the famous D.C. statue of Lincoln ""Wish I could have been there for you pal"" you dont snigger. In the early evening of his career he is something of a loose revolver rather crude and decidedly macho. What did you expect? Spalding Gray? Sailing through the role Eastwood huffs and puffs running beside limousines climbing over fences leaping across rooptops and tangling with the CIA and FBI as he performs his Secret Service heroics-albeit Hollywood not Washington Secret Service heroics.Petersen directs his film in a straightforward workmanlike fashion-few surprises here-and curiously for most of the film is better at establishing a kind of amiability than a hard tension. One suspects that if Eastwood himself had directed it would have more sparkle and snap. Petersen does get good performances out of his supporting cast which includes Gary Cole as Horrigans prickly arrogant field supervisor and John Mahoney as the reasonable reflective Secret Service chief.To lighten things up writer Maguire has provided as a foil agent Lilly Raines (nicely played by Rene Russo of ""Lethal Weapon 3"") whos as feisty as she is comely. The target of Horrigans sexist remarks-he insists that she and other women agents are in place as ""window dressing"" only to court the feminist vote-she is quite capable of holding her own.1 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesIn the Line of FireJanuary 5 2009`American Dreamz at home in a blue stateApril 21 2006Shows To WatchMarch 13 2008The Watcher recommendsJanuary 4 2009`Hoot green lights school age activism for environmentMay 5 2006Find More Stories AboutDylan McdermottTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-07-09/entertainment/9307090262_1_dylan-mcdermott-frank-horrigan-routine-thriller,200,inthelineoffire0,inthelineoffire,chicagotribune

FRIDAYS GUIDE TO MOVIES amp; MUSIC. Siskels Flicks Picks.Clint Vs. Malkovich Matchup Makes `Line Of Fire A ThrillJuly 09 1993|By Gene Siskel.Our Flick of the Week is ""In the Line of Fire"" a solid thriller for the most simple of reasons A compelling hero is confronted with a truly creepy villain. Clint Eastwood plays a veteran Secret Service agent with a checkered past; he was on the presidential detail during the Kennedy assassination.Now advanced in age he requests a chance to redeem himself by getting back in the saddle to protect a new president against a clever assassin (John Malkovich) who has the high-tech style of a professional hit man. Eastwood gives a captivating performance as a flawed hero the same sort of role hes been playing for years most recently in ""Unforgiven."" Because of the praise hes received lately as a director people may forget hes a classic minimalist actor. And Malkovich is great as a slimeball especially when saying little. The screenplay couldnt be more direct in pitting against each other two men who share a common attribute Each is willing to give up his life to affect the presidency. Director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot"") moves the story along but his real job is to simply stay out of the way of his two racehorse lead actors. And he does.The only down side is that the film truly exploits the Kennedy assassination for entertainment value even placing Eastwood ""Zelig""-like into photographs of that fateful day. Is that necessary? And do we have to see the Zapruder scene where the presidents skull is assaulted?

"MOVIE REVIEW  Fire Lines Up a Worthy Villain for Clint  John Malkovichs bad guy matches Eastwoods hero strength for strength as the bullets fly in this crisply entertaining action-adventure story. - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW  Fire Lines Up a Worthy Villain for Clint  John Malkovichs bad guy matches Eastwoods hero strength for strength as the bullets fly in this crisply entertaining action-adventure story.July 09 1993|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES FILM CRITIC Used to be that all a hero needed to operate was a weapon a partner and a code of honor with maybe a good woman thrown into the mix. In these more uncertain times however a hero is hardly worth saluting without a villain of stature on the other side standing mockingly in his path and matching him strength for strength.And when the hero is played by Clint Eastwood this requirement becomes even more critical. For Eastwood no ordinary good guy is a paradigm of virile qualities a man who has been so invulnerable for so long hes become a one-of-a-kind icon whose movies are built around him with all the care and discernment of a necklace fabricated for the Hope Diamond.So with Eastwood starring as a veteran Secret Service agent in Wolfgang Petersens crisply entertaining ""In the Line of Fire"" (citywide) the key question is who gets to play the implacable assassin sworn to drop the President in his tracks. The choice was John Malkovich and its difficult to think of a better one.Its not just that Malkovich is an excellent actor with credits ranging from ""Dangerous Liaisons"" to ""Of Mice and Men."" Its the kind of actor he is an Obie-winning veteran of the prestigious Steppenwolf Theater Company who is at home even on the stages of Londons West End. For the Record Los Angeles Times Tuesday July 13 1993 Home Edition Calendar Part F Page 5 Column 2 Entertainment Desk 1 inches; 22 words Type of Material Correction Executive producer--Gail Katz was also an executive producer on ""In the Line of Fire."" Her name was omitted from the credits in the review in Fridays Calendar.With a background so spiritually different from Eastwoods ""Rawhide""/spaghetti Western origins Malkovich makes the best kind of villain for this piece providing the kind of intrinsically adversarial presence that James Dean for instance did for Raymond Massey in ""East of Eden."" And Malkovichs insinuating carefully thought out delivery is in the same way an ideal foil for Eastwoods bluntly straightforward habits.Eastwoods Frank Horrigan is not protecting anyone at first he is working with partner Al DAndrea (Dylan McDermott) on the services anti-counterfeiting detail and taking less guff than anyone in the federal government. One night called on to investigate a suspicious lodger he and Al discover enough disturbing evidence to make Frank sure theyve stumbled onto an executioners lair.But not only has Frank recognized a potential killer the killer has recognized Frank as well. For Horrigan is not just any Secret Service agent; he was John F. Kennedys favorite on the scene in Dallas and traumatized from that day to this (and for all we know in a support group with Kevin Costners similarly disturbed ""Bodyguard"") because he wasnt able to stop the bullet that found the President.All this comes out in a series of phone calls that the assassin who airily asks to be called Booth (as in John Wilkes) because that man ""had flair panache"" makes to Frank out of sheer dark glee that this legendary agent is on his trail. ""Going up against you raises the game to a much higher level"" Booth says in his oily menacing way. ""Fate has brought us together. I cant get over the irony.""Booths feeling of connection with Frank his desire to simultaneously admire and taunt him is the strongest point in ""In the Line of Fires"" script which ends up giving many of its best lines to the predator. (It was written by Jeff McGuire on the suggestion of producer Jeff Apple a Secret Service buff since he was a teen-ager whose continued fascination apparently led to extensive agency cooperation.)More or less a genius of a hit man master of weapons phone trickery disguise and no doubt much more Booth is especially good at driving Frank crazy messing with his head with all those needling phone calls. Hobbled by encroaching age doubting superiors pain-in-the-ass politicos who just dont get it even a bad case of the flu Frank manages to get himself reassigned to the presidential protection detail and perseveres. Still smarting over Dallas he knows that Booth is going to make a try at this President and he wants to be there when it happens.Given that everyone in the theater knows the same thing to say that director Petersen completely involves us in the action is saying a great deal. The first first-rank director Eastwood has agreed to work with in at least 10 years Petersen (best known for the splendid ""Das Boot"") brings many of the same qualities as Eastwood himself would to the project including a lean unadorned style a concern with pace and an emphasis on keeping the audience intrigued. With his professionalism and his understanding of genre Petersen is as good a match for Eastwood on his side of the camera as Malkovich is on his.As for Eastwood himself his laconic mastery of screen acting has become such a given that ""Line of Fires"" script feels free to have some gentle fun with his durable persona by having Horrigan claim ""a good glare can be just as effective as a gun."" In truth every part of this film trades so heavily on Eastwoods presence that it is impossible to imagine it with anyone else in the starring role.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe Colbert Report Smelling John MalkovichApril 2 2014Siris new gig Being John Malkovichs iPhoneMay 24 2012Quirky Being John Malkovich May Have the Last Best LaughNovember 30 1999Tending to the Garden  Director Clint Eastwood...November 21 1997Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-09/entertainment/ca-12845_1_john-malkovich,200,inthelineoffire2,inthelineoffire,latimes

An Action Film With All The Right Moves - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Clint Eastwood An Action Film With All The Right MovesMovies - Review - In the Line of Fire -  - Cast Clint Eastwood John Malkovich Rene Russo. - Director Wolfgang Petersen. - Screenwriter Jeff Maguire. - Cinematographer John Bailey. - Music Ennio Morricone. - Running time 2 hours 10 minutes. - Industry rating R (restricted). - Parents guide Language violence.Fire Is A Formula Movie But It Makes The Most Of Its ElementsJuly 9 1993|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticClint Eastwood is one of the few people whom Oliver Stone has not tried to implicate in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Still the character Eastwood plays in In the Line of Fire feels responsible for the presidents death.Back in the early 1960s Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan (Eastwood) was Kennedys most trusted bodyguard. He had JFKs ear but he couldnt save JFKs neck.As In the Line of Fire (which opens today) begins its three decades later. A mystery man calling himself Booth - as in John Wilkes - starts phoning Horrigan out of the blue.Booth knows all about the JFK business and yet he seems to admire Horrigan.But thats not the main thing. The main thing is that Booth intends to assassinate the current president.For Horrigan - who is close to retirement age - this could mean a last chance at redemption or a final fall into disgrace.Not to mention death.As this premise may suggest In the Line of Fire is just the sort of action flick that the recent Last Action Hero was designed to lampoon.As in a lot of these films the hero is as Horrigan describes himself a borderline burnout with questionable social skills. He has a sacrificial partner whose demise he must avenge and an abusive boss who keeps trying to get him thrown off the case.There is also of course acomely female in the picturesomeone with whom Horrigan first trades insults and later kisses.But despite the presence of all these action-flick cliches In the Line of Fire works. Sure its no more than a formula movie but its an effective formula movie.Director Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot) maintains a high tension level throughout most of the pictures two-hour-plus running time. And he gives the film a sophisticated texture - something not many of Clint Eastwoods pictures have had.The director does all this despite the fact that screenwriter Jeff Maguires dialogue is rather self-conscious - and not nearly as clever as Maguire seems to think it is. Still the plot is very well-designed in the sense that it keeps you guessing.If Eastwood were a better actor - along the lines of Gene Hackman say - this movie might have risen above its formula restrictions instead of just being a decent example of how the formula can work.But of course he isnt.Even after all these years in the business Eastwoods range is still extremely narrow. In fact his range is exactly that of the character he played in last years Unforgiven - a tough quietly tormented loner.As if to compensate for Eastwoods inexpressiveness his new role comes equipped with an assortment of pat character traits such as playing the piano loving jazz and not wearing sunglasses. He also prides himself on being a careful observer.I know things about people he mutters ominously. We forgive Eastwood his failings because hes like a cantankerous old relative who we know will say something embarrassing at every family gathering.There arent a lot of other performances in In the Line of Fire. Rene Russo (Lethal Weapon 3) is the love interest Dylan McDermott is Horrigans partner Fred Dalton Thompson is a top White House official and so on.Each has his or her moment but thats about all. (Russos moment is a scene in which she and Eastwood grope each other as they lunge toward her bed clothing and security hardware hitting the floor along the way.)Fortunately for the movie there is one genuinely terrific performance As the assassin known as Booth John Malkovich (Dangerous Liaisons) is marvelously twisted.Even in his earliest scenes - when hes just a wormy voice on the phone - hes wonderfully (almost shockingly) insinuating.When he finally appears on screen his familiar face is at its most calmly menacing. And when Booth shoots innocent people Malkovichs eyes are emotionless - as if he were daring us to imagine what is going on inside his characters mind at that moment.Booth is a master of disguise and although Malkovich does appear in various costumes the role never quite becomes a tour de force because the script doesnt give him the chance to embody a range of personalities.But Malkovich is on screen a lot and what he does get an opportunity to do is sufficiently suggestive to make parts of the film truly creepy.The world can be a cruel place to an honest man Booth tells Horrigan on the phone referring to both of them.The great thing about the way Malkovich plays Booth is that we can quite plainly see how this murderous sicko can think of himself as one of the good guys.

Some are slick like those supple Italian loafers cobbled for people who like to drive instead of walk. Others are well-worn like the sturdy clodhoppers that have been re-soled many times but are so comfortable and reliable theyve become irreplaceable.Clint Eastwood is like those clodhoppers and In the Line of Fire is his perfect fit. Paced to Eastwoods prey-stalking stride this suspenser about a Secret Service agent who failed to save JFK from an assassins bullet and thus is doubly determined to protect the current chief is custom-made for Hollywoods First Action Hero.Like a certain actor who recently essayed the Last Action Hero Eastwood is attempting to retool his screen persona and does so with considerable success - and sudden impact.No longer Mr. Invincible the character who silently puffed a cheroot while noisily blowing away his enemies he has evolved into an almost chatty guy painfully aware of his diminished powers. As Frank Horrigan ""the only active agent who ever lost a president"" Eastwood cries.Witnessing Clint Eastwood cry is like seeing a figure on Mount Rushmore weep Are those tears or crumbling pieces of rock? When He who embodies masculine screen invulnerability breaks down its clear that our culture is undergoing a seismic shift that a man of action can also be a man of reflection. A dam is burst a star is reborn.This is not to criticize Eastwoods previous underplaying. Its much harder not to let the machinery of acting show as John Wayne and Eastwood know though both have passed virtually unnoticed while the showy Spencer Tracys and Dustin Hoffmans get all the respect. This is to acknowledge that Eastwood is stretching himself as an actor just as he has stretched himself for two decades as a director. In the Line of Fire demonstrates that the Great American Loner can become part of the greater American community.Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot) In the Line of Fire has many other things going for it besides Eastwoods downbeat performance. Secret Service agent Horrigan is cursed (and the movie blessed) with a sinister villain Mitch Leary (John Malkovich) the Hannibal Lecter of the political- assassin set.Responding to the call of a troubled Washington landlady Horrigan examines an ""artwork"" created by her tenant a collage of the JFK RFK and MLK assassinations in which its clear that its artist identifies with the killers. The tenant is Mitch Leary who soon realizes that Horrigan is onto him. Savoring the irony that the man who lost one president might conceivably lose a second Leary telephones Horrigan to make threats on the current presidents life.In his uniquely snaky way Malkovich is terrific. Hes a particularly effective antagonist for Eastwood because Malkovichs powers are verbal - he can twist a word like a pretzel - and Eastwoods are physical. Their characters phone repartee with Leary dropping words such as ""panache"" and Horrigan puzzling over what it means - is priceless. Leary is a graceful matador teasing his adversary reducing Horrigan to a nostril-twitching bull who keeps charging at the cape but cant find the man behind it.Between them director Petersen and screenwriter Jeff Maguire do a memorable job developing their characters in this story of personal and professional redemption.Naturally Horrigans favorite haunt is that shrine to another assassinated president the Lincoln Memorial where he woos his Secret Service colleague Lilly Raines (Rene Russo). Horrigan whose longest previous relationships have been with his Miles Davis CDs and Jack Daniels bottles pursues Lilly with the same diligence he brings to his pursuit of Leary but to more comic effect. A scene in which Horrigan and Lilly almost bed - shedding their concealed handcuffs and firearms with dispatch - is worthy of The Naked Gun. In the Line of Fire deftly weaves comedy with suspense action with passion.And so what if Frank Horrigan refers to himself as a dinosaur? Hes the one Tyrannosaurus Rex of the summer of 93 who will never become extinct.IN THE LINE OF FIRE    1/2Produced by Jeff Apple directed by Wolfgang Petersen written by Jeff Maguire photography by John Bailey music by Ennio Morricone distributed by Columbia Pictures.Running time 2 hours 3 mins.Frank Horrigan - Clint EastwoodMitch Leary - John MalkovichLilly Raines - Rene RussoAl DAndrea - Dylan McDermottHarry Sargent - Fred Dalton ThompsonSam Campagna - John MahoneyParents guide R (profanity violence sexual innuendo)Showing at area theaters Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""http//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> comments powered by Disqus Commenting policy | Comments FAQ FEATURED ARTICLESApothecary gardens fuel farm-to-medicine-cabinet movementTiffany Trump and Naomi Biden graduate Penn dad and granddad looking onPowerball fever Jackpot rises to 900 millionMoreDe Mazia Art Brings 2.38 MillionLeader Of Jbm Sentenced To Life Aaron Jones Was Convicted Of Conspiring To Distribute 100 Million In Cocaine.

Comments In the Line of Fire Clint Eastwood plays a Secret Service agent--actually Dirty Harry in disguise (with minor variations)--emotionally devastated by the assassination of John F. Kennedy who gets a shot at redeeming himself 30 years later when a loony assassin (John Malkovich) also trained by the Secret Service menaces the president and baits Eastwood about it for no discernible reason except to keep Eastwood working. If you dont care about such motivations this is a pretty good thriller though not one youre likely to remember for very long.

Directed by Wolfgang Petersen from a script by Jeff Maguire. Alderwood Enumclaw Everett 9 Factoria Gateway Kirkland Parkplace Metro Newmark Oak Tree Parkway Plaza Puget Park and Valley drive-ins. ""R"" - Restricted due to violence language. ------------------------------------------------------------------- ""A living legend the only active agent who ever lost a president."" Thats how Frank Horrigan a Secret Service agent who has punished himself for three decades for ""losing"" JFK in Dallas identifies himself in ""In the Line of Fire."" Before the movie is over Frank will have more to feel guilty about as he endangers the life of his partner (Dylan McDermott) takes risks that embarrass the current president (a nonentity played by Jim Curley) and reluctantly joins in the mental games played by Mitch Leary a would-be assassin whos got his number. John Malkovich plays this initially mysterious telephone crank who gradually becomes more dangerous and understandably nihilistic as the plot advances. Mitch has his reasons as well as his methods. Given his background its not surprising that he has nearly telepathic powers. Like Hannibal Lecter in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" Mitch enjoys seeking out psychological weak spots and manipulating people constantly reminding Frank of his failings and questioning whether a bodyguards job is ultimately heroic or absurd. Malkovich plays the role with wicked enthusiasm. As Frank Clint Eastwood is even better. Now 63 Eastwood seems to have been saving himself up for parts like this in which he can appear spiritually and physically exhausted yet remain as determined and defiant as Dirty Harry. He makes Franks guilt much more than a plot device carefully turning it into the underlying motivation for most of Franks professional behavior. This is a worthy follow-up performance to Eastwoods ""Unforgiven"" Oscar victory even if the script by Jeff Maguire isnt as ambitious or as literate as David Webb Peoples writing for ""Unforgiven."" Maguire spends too much time working up an implausible romance between the aging Frank and a younger agent (Rene Russo) that unfortunately recalls ""The Bodyguard"" (so does the climax) but eventually he gets back on track. For the most part this is an exciting engaging thriller well-directed by Wolfgang Petersen a German filmmaker whose best movie ""Das Boot"" was released more than a decade ago. Like many European directors disoriented by the Hollywood system Petersen has made some overblown misfires (""Enemy Mine"" ""Shattered"") but ""In the Line of Fire"" demonstrates again that he is a world-class filmmaker. Working with veteran cinematographer John Bailey (""Silverado"") and editor Anne Coates (""Lawrence of Arabia"") Petersen uses the Washington D.C. locations particularly well making dramatic use of several D.C. landmarks and staging a suspenseful vertigo-inducing rooftop chase with the Capitol in the background. Perhaps it takes a foreigner to make the familiar locations look so thrillingly exotic. Petersen also makes the most of the scripts ironies including a wonderfully absurd showdown between CIA and FBI agents invading the same abandoned house and he doesnt use the peripheral characters only to advance the plot. John Mahoney Fred Dalton Thompson and especially McDermott are allowed to act as if their characters had lives and dilemmas of their own. Copyright (c) 1993 Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved.

Clint Eastwood has always been an old man. Even in the 60s as the gunslinger in Sergio Leone westerns Eastwood had the squinty eyes sour mouth and weary walk of a soldier who had been in too many wars. The six-day stubble hid countless psychic scars; the cigar butt stuck between his teeth suggested a world gone up in smoke; the poncho he wore could have been a shroud.

In the Line of Fire is a proficiently made thriller pitting Clint Eastwoods vet Secret Service agent against John Malkovichs insidious would-be presidential assassin. Frank Horrigan (Eastwood) has been haunted since Nov. 22 1963 by the possibility that he could have saved John F. Kennedys life. As JFKs favorite Secret Service agent Horrigan was with the president in Dallas and was closest to him when the shot rang out. Its this weakness that is manipulated by Mitch Leary (Malkovich) a professional assassin who makes no secret of his intention to kill the current president sometime before the election. Horrigan wins an assignment to cover the chief of state while he tries to nail Leary who calls to every so often to taunt him and at the same time must endure the gibes of his colleagues who consider him a borderline burnout with questionable social skills and a dinosaur. What neophyte scripter Jeff Maguires plot comes down to is the cat-and-mouse game between Horrigan and Leary and the craftiness and strategies involved on both sides while not exactly ingenious are tantalizing enough to compel interest. Director Wolfgang Petersen sends the story efficiently down its straight and narrow track deftly engineering the battle of wills between two desperately committed men. Eastwood splendidly gives Horrigan humor grit and imagination. Malkovich provides a delicious villain a true psychopath so sure of himself that hes willing to give his pursuer half a chance of catching him. 1993 Nominations Best Supp. Actor (John Malcovich) Original Screenplay Film Editing In the Line of FireProductionColumbia/Castle Rock.

After all the noise and hot air attending the releases of the somewhat less than perfect ""Jurassic Park"" ""Last Action Hero"" and ""The Firm"" he slips into town almost modestly giving the ""True Grit"" performance of his career in the most uproariously entertaining movie of the summer so far. ""In the Line of Fire"" is not exactly ""Potemkin."" Its movie making of the high smooth commercial order that Hollywood prides itself on but achieves with singular infrequency. Mr. Eastwoods charcoal-mellowed persona lends ""In the Line of Fire"" its tone and class. He is the movies spine. At the same time note should also be made of those who gave the film its shape Jeff Maguire who wrote the original screenplay based on an idea by Jeff Apple the producer and Wolfgang Petersen the German-born director of ""Das Boot"" who has finally found an American property to equal his earlier international success. ""In the Line of Fire"" is the kind of movie that gives teamwork a good name. Taking the remnants of a dozen other movies this team has concocted a suspense melodrama so satisfying that its cliches which keep it zipping forward become epiphanies by the time you reach the end and look back everything makes sense. There are very few movies this summer about which that can be said with a straight face. Mr. Eastwoods role would appear to have been made to order although he has a way of inhabiting his roles so completely that its never easy to tell where the writing leaves off and he begins. He plays Frank Horrigan self-described as ""a white piano-playing male over the age of 50"" while he may be over 60 in fact. His age makes no difference to the audience (he looks agelessly great) but its a major factor in the film. Frank is a Secret Service agent who probably should have retired some time ago but cant. His job has become his life since it caused his split from his wife and family. Hes the sort of guy who winds up each day in a favorite cocktail bar noodling on the piano drinking too much Jack Daniels. (Jack Daniels isnt mentioned in the film but Frank would be a brand-name drinker.) He also has a secret. On one of his first assignments 30 years ago Frank was a member of the Secret Service detail that did not prevent the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas. Frank is haunted by the memory of that failure and by the question he keeps asking himself would he have had the courage or instinct to throw himself between the President and the bullet if he had had that split-second opportunity? When first met Frank and his young partner Al DAndrea (Dylan McDermott) are working on routine if dangerous assignments relating to counterfeiters and such. During an investigation of a man who seems obsessed by Presidential assassinations Frank suspects that the fellow is not a crackpot but someone with a seriously deranged mind. This suspicion is confirmed when the man begins to telephone Frank at all hours to chat about his plans to kill the President and to make sarcastic comments about Franks behavior as part of the Dallas motorcade. He either knows Frank has studied him or has access to his agency files. Frank alerts his superiors and asks that he and Al be assigned to the Presidential security team. ""In the Line of Fire"" is the story of Franks efforts to identify and stop the would-be killer who stalks him with malicious joy as he stalks the President in earnest. Its also the story of Franks need to prove himself. Finally though not least its the story of his hilarious September-May affair with Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) a beautiful much younger agent also assigned to the Presidents security. Lilly is as odd as Frank. She knows she must be nuts to fall for this dinosaur. When she tells him ""Lets face it Frank youre too old"" its as much to convince herself as it is to persuade him that he ought to retire gracefully and not mess up other peoples lives including hers. ""In the Line of Fire"" also has a first-rate villain in Mitch Leary played by John Malkovich with the same insinuating mixture of wit and malevolence that the actor brought to his New York stage performance in Sam Shepards ""True West."" Mr. Malkovich eases into the film in a kind of slither. First hes a voice on the telephone then an eye a nose a face seen in a pore-tight close-up. When finally seen in full figure he appears to be both maniacal and utterly ordinary. The screenplay does well by both Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Malkovich especially in their telephone exchanges in which Mitch delights in sending up the Secret Service man while the rest of the agency is frantically trying to trace the call. Mitch constantly questions Franks sincerity about being willing to give his life to protect the Presidents. Mitch acknowledges that his will be a suicide mission. ""I have a rendezvous with death"" he tells Frank dramatizing himself with the self-consciousness of a first-year English major. When Frank indicates that he recognizes the Alan Seeger lines Mitch cant resist setting Frank straight about literature ""Its really not a good poem Frank."" There is equal intelligence in Mr. Petersens direction of the action sequences beginning with the films scarily funny opening in which the arrest of some counterfeiters goes dangerously wrong. ""In the Line of Fire"" is so neatly constructed that even though Frank and Mitch confront each other quite early the tension of the virtually movie-long chase does not let up until the end. One pursuit across the rooftops of Washington is as elegantly staged as it is brutal and revealing of character. Although the film moves at a dizzy pace from Washington to Los Angeles to Chicago and back again there are no false moves. Nor does the audience ever get lost. ""In the Line of Fire"" is one of the few Hollywood suspense melodramas that dont seem to ignore the realities of the world outside. It uses them. Its not really vital to the narrative but it helps that the film takes place during the final weeks of a Presidents campaign for re-election. Because he is trailing at the polls his handlers put him in jeopardy that at any other time would be unthinkable. The campaign in ""In the Line of Fire"" isnt about issues and ideas but about the naked wish to win. Sound familiar? Ms. Russo who played Mel Gibsons battle-scarred lover in ""Lethal Weapon 3"" works terrifically well with Mr. Eastwood. Their scenes have some of the caustic spirit of the material Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin used to write for Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. They are genuinely funny lovers. Mr. McDermott is also very good as Al Franks partner a guy who remains unconvinced that hes cut out for the only kind of work that makes his friend feel alive. Commanding the film but never getting in the way of it is Mr. Eastwood. His Frank is as obsessed as Mr. Malkovichs assassin but also easy and self-aware cool and amused. This is the richest performance yet by an actor who among other things keeps getting better and better. ""In the Line of Fire"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes vulgar language and a lot of violence. In the Line of Fire Directed by Wolfgang Petersen; written by Jeff Maguire; director of photography John Bailey; edited by Anne V. Coates; music by Ennio Morricone; production designer Lilly Kilvert; produced by Jeff Apple; released by Columbia Pictures. Running time 126 minutes. This film is rated R. Frank Horrigan . . .

"In the Line of Fire | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; in-the-line-of-fire ) In the Line of Fire (United States 1993) A movie review by James Berardinelli In 1963 Frank Horrigan was among the ""best and brightest"" of the Secret Service the personal choice of President Kennedy. On November 22 in Dallas an afternoon that Horrigan will never forget he became one of the few living agents to lose a president. Now decades later and only months before a presidential election (perhaps 1992 or 1996 - were never told exactly) Mitch Leary (John Malkovich) is stalking the President. Believing there to be an intangible bond between himself and Horrigan (he says they were both betrayed by a government they had once loved) Leary makes contact with the Secret Service agent to discuss his intentions. Following his conversation with the potential killer Horrigan acts quickly to get himself posted to protection duty. This time he has no intention of failing and believes that given the opportunity he will take the bullet. But Leary has everything on his side -- time opportunity and a group of pig-headed behind-the-scenes men at the White House who refuse to alter the Presidents itinerary no matter how grave the apparent danger is. And as the election draws closer Horrigans chances of averting a second tragedy seem progressively less likely. John Malkovich may be one of the screens most overlooked actors. Or at least he was until this performance. It isnt that hes never done good work before -- his interpretation of Lenny in Gary Sineses Of Mice and Men was masterful -- but most of the time he hasnt been recognized for it. However like Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs now that Malkovich has been given a visible role in a significant movie he should get his due. Hands down Malkovichs assassin is the best thing about this solid thriller -- a villain that rivals Hannibal Lecter for intelligence and cold calculated viciousness. Rene Russo gives her strongest performance to date. In truth shes little more than the ""window dressing"" that Frank Horrigan suggests is the role of female Secret Service agents but she manages to do something with a thankless part. Yet even playing second fiddle to one of Hollywoods most popular leading men she gets noticed. Eastwood is Eastwood albeit a more vulnerable version akin to what we saw in Unforgiven. Hes still tough and he isnt afraid to use his gun but Frank Horrigan is haunted by his past. Hes no longer sure whether it was simple indecision or an unwillingness to take a bullet that led to his not being there for Kennedy and the possibility that the same situation might arise a second time troubles him day and night. Horrigan gives us the human side of Eastwood -- the side we never see in a Dirty Harry film the side that isnt afraid to shed a tear. Director Wolfgang Petersen best known for Das Boot but also at the helm for the taut twisted Shattered is aware of whats necessary to make a good thriller work. He knows the importance of pacing and plays the tension in In the Line of Fire like a virtuoso. Petersen takes what could have been a muddled motion picture and structures it perfectly creating a strong piece of entertainment. It helps of course that he has a capable cast. Plot-wise In the Line of Fire is nothing extraordinary. Its basically a formula-type thriller with one or two twists thrown in to keep the viewer off-balance. However strength of character coupled with a consistently-high level of excitement makes this film anything but ordinary. The most intriguing element of In the Line of Fire is the cat-and-mouse game between Horrigan and Leary. The relationship of these two is fascinating in a twisted way as it explores psychological layers which many motion pictures find too difficult to convey realistically. Overall this is one of the most intelligent thrillers of the summer. In the Line of Fire doesnt require the special effects bonanza of Jurassic Park to involve the audience nor does it rely on the mega-budget explosions and mountaintop battles of Cliffhanger.

A dumber more hapless group of incompetents is hard to imagine. And leading the bunch is Agent Horrigan dinosaur and living legend.And why does Frank cast such a giant shadow? Because he was there that day in Dallas in 63. In the car behind Kennedys. And when the first shot was fired he froze. He cant remember why exactly. Maybe he was afraid of doing what his job demands -- which is if need be to sacrifice his life for the chiefs. Maybe it all happened too fast and there was nothing he could have done. But when the moment came he wasnt up to it and so here he is the only active agent ever to lose a president.Now that Eastwood has won his Oscar theres an amusing notion making the rounds that the former cowboy actor is some sort of newly discovered Brando. In fact Eastwood is what he has always been -- a great movie star with an extremely limited range who by sheer force of personality has carved out an enduring niche in our popular culture. If he is an actor at all it is on the iconic level in the tradition of a star like John Wayne or Clark Gable who simply amalgamated each new character into the larger whole of his star personality.""In the Line of Fire"" works right out of the heart of that niche. Again Eastwood plays the impatient individualist and man of action who hates the bureaucrats upstairs almost as much as he does the criminals he rounds up for them. Again he is a cut-to-the-chase guy who gets things done but also the perpetual insubordinate who spends half his time breaking every procedural rule in the book and the other half in the bosss office getting bawled out for something hes screwed up.To his credit Eastwood does throw himself completely into the role. He plays the Clint Eastwood character hes created for himself with the confident economy of a seasoned pro. The years have transformed his face into a magnificent object; its still fun just to look at him and count the squint lines between his eyebrows. What he does only he can do and he does it with the extravagant ease of a man who has completely come to terms with what has made him a star. And yet hes still secure enough in himself to risk humiliation by going against the audiences expections as he does in several scenes here -- most notably the one in which he confesses with quivering lip (And whats this? A tear perhaps?) to his fellow agent and love interest the model-actress Rene Russo (""Lethal Weapon 3"") about the burden of guilt hes carried around since that day in Dallas.Most of his performance is still by rote as is most of the plot. Working from the script by Jeff Maguire director Wolfgang Petersen (""Das Boot"") plods through the narrative as if he were completely unconcerned with giving it even a semblance of credibility. (Agents are always throwing up their hands after a failed phone trace and yelping ""Darn it almost had im. He must be using some kind of scrambling device."")And then -- one is tempted to say -- there is John Malkovich. Wearing a mind-boggling collection of wigs fake noses eyeglasses beards and mustaches Malkovich is his own traveling road company -- the man of a thousand disguises -- and watching him you get the feeling hes having a blast doing all this play-pretend dress-up stuff. Its a dream role for an actor a really juicy villain and Malkovich does such wonderfully unexpected things especially with his line readings that he leaves us dumbfounded. No other performer is more effortlessly unnerving than this perversely gifted actor.Quite naturally then the most interesting scenes in ""In the Line of Fire"" are those in which Malkovich appears the best of which are Learys needling chats with Frank on the phone in which the would-be assassin taunts his pursuer riding him about his divorce and his drinking and questioning his courage.""What do you see in the dark when the demons come out?"" Frank asks.""I see you"" Leary responds ""standing over the grave of another dead president.""As enticing as this showdown might sound on paper in reality a healthy portion of the film is wasted as Frank and his partner (played unremarkably by Dylan McDermott) run up one blind alley and down the other. In addition theres a good deal of stale flirting between Frank and Agent Raines (Russo) during which sparks doggedly refuse to fly. (Actually Eastwood is at his disarming best while making these awkward half-joking passes.)But what sense can be made out of a film that tells us that the country is no longer what it used to be that its flag has fallen but then makes shameless use of footage from the famous Zapruder film emphasizing the frames in which the presidents skull is blown apart to get a cheap reaction from the audience? No matter how you slice it thats cynical filmmaking and much more in keeping with the moral decline it denounces than with the virtuous past it extols. ""In the Line of Fire"" is rated R for violence and language.

"In the Line of Fire Related Item Go to Video Finder In the Line of Fire By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer July 09 1993 Director Wolfgang Petersen Cast Clint Eastwood; John Malkovich; Rene Russo; Dylan McDermott; Gary Cole; Fred Dalton Thompson; John Mahoney Under 17 restricted Compare prices for this movie Find local video stores More movie shopping Save money with NextCard Visa Clint Eastwood is still cleaning the town of punks varmints and career criminals. But in recent years that head has become gray. The leathery skin clings even tighter to the skull. The furrows in his face could irrigate Death Valley. But this creeping hoary condition has made things better. Even the most throwaway roles have become imbued with poignance. Hes not just taking on opponents. Hes fighting time itself -- the horrible softness of age. And hes doing it for us -- aspiring old farts all.""In the Line of Fire"" which has him huffing and puffing next to presidential limousines is not a brilliant movie. But thanks to Eastwood it feels like one. As Frank Horrigan a veteran Secret Service agent in need of redemption hes in effortless -- and touching -- command. Weathering the ravages of time and the insults of young-lion colleagues he means to catch aspiring (and taunting) assassin John Malkovich even if it kills him.That increasingly is the point of this cat-and-mouse movie Is Eastwood willing to take a bullet for the president? Can he put his life on the line? Its not the deepest thematic concern you ever saw on screen. But its watchable great fun. And while Eastwood toils and sweats in the acid test of his life he still has the juice to joust with fellow agent Rene Russo.Now working as a field agent Eastwood has been haunted for 30 years by the JFK assassination -- a tragedy for which he feels responsible. As a young presidential bodyguard he watched it all happen in a state of shock -- instead of diving in front of the Chief Executive.Those memories are stirred up when Malkovich excruciatingly aware of Eastwoods guilt teasingly challenges the veteran agent to stop him from killing the president. For Eastwood this is a psychic second chance. But Malkovich is a master of elusiveness and Eastwood who has a habit of rubbing his colleagues (and presidential clients) the wrong way keeps getting pushed away from the action.As the movie progresses to its high-climax showdown -- when the president makes an election-eve speech in California -- things reach their predictable zenith of dramatic exaggeration. But Eastwoods so stately to watch and Malkovichs so wonderfully over the top (imagine William Shatner playing Bruno in ""Strangers on a Train"") you swallow all the implausibilities.Malkovich who leaves a trail of bodies as he stalks the president likes to tantalize Eastwood by phone with new riddles threats and pearls of wisdom. At one point he tells Eastwood (whom he calls ""Frank"" with eerie familiarity) he shouldnt feel so bad about the JFK thing. After all he asserts Kennedy had a death wish. ""His favorite poem was A Rendezvous With Death which is not a good poem Frank.""We meet Eastwood playing undercover among a clutch of drug dealers. When things suddenly turn sour Eastwood -- surrounded by three armed bad guys -- has to take evasive measures. ""Youre under arrest"" he shouts. As the gunmen draw their weapons Eastwood blows two of them away. He swings around to face the third villain still struggling with his gun.""And youre under arrest too"" Eastwood informs him just a tad redundantly.Apart from its Hollywood requirements (screen psycho must be white and well educated ending must be second -- in dramatic hyperbole -- only to the apocalypse man must get woman etc.) ""In the Line of Fire"" has an effectively low-key conspiracy-thriller tone. Director Wolfgang (""Das Boot"") Petersen concerns himself solidly with the psychological warfare between Eastwood and Malkovich rather than razzle-dazzle Blitzkrieg moviemaking. Another plus -- for locals at least -- is the satisfying use of Washington from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial (courting spot for Eastwood and Russo) to Adams-Morgan. I mean theres Clint Eastwood waiting to be picked up by car and hes standing on 18th Street.

Concept One Clint Eastwood grimacing in the name of justice as Frank Horrigan a veteran Secret Service agent who screwed up the day JFK went to Dallas and now 30 years later wants one last chance to protect his President-even if it means (especially if it means) throwing himself in front of an assassins bullet. Concept Two John Malkovich who has become a hammy master of the sardonic-oddball school as a teasing psychopath who announces his plan to kill the President and lets everyone know hes willing to die in the process. Concept Three A plot that builds with meticulously crafted tension to the inevitable assassination attempt-a sequence so packed with split-second decisions rapid-fire crosscutting and heart-in-the-throat suspense music that the only way to watch it without your pulse rising is not to have a pulse in the first place. With all of that going for it its hard to see how In the Line of Fire could be anything less than rock-solid entertainment-and indeed it is. Yet its never more than that. Though the movie is engrossing it lacks something fire weirdness originality. The director Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot) knows how to cobble a scene together but hes not exactly a wizard at pace. At times Petersen seems to be aping the sleek existential doom of Oliver Stones JFK but that was a dazzling labyrinth of a movie one willing to open raw wounds. In the Line of Fire is just a moody popcorn thriller and whats more it seems almost completely derived from other popcorn thrillers. The main plot has the would-be killer Mitch Leary (Malkovich) calling Horrigan on the phone-at home at the office-to torment him. Calmly in his slithery malevolent whine Malkovich teases Horrigan about his dirty little secret. It seems that on Nov. 22 1963 seconds after the first shot was fired in Dealey Plaza Horrigan hesitated out of doubt and fear to leap closer to JFKs car. If hed acted decisively maybe just maybe he could have blocked that second bullet. (Though presented as pure fiction this struck me as crazier than anything I heard in JFK.) Having made Horrigan feel all vulnerable Leary drops his big revelation Since he himself is willing to die as a kamikaze assassin and since Horrigans job depends on his absolute readiness to take a bullet the two men asserts Leary are really the same. Even as Eastwood has been able to keep his hostile charisma intact he has mellowed into the elder statesman of vengeful macho. Here he turns in a less subtle version of his Unforgiven performance passing off his squinty reticence as guilt. (Youd almost forget that Eastwood is a star because his characters get a sadistic charge out of killing people.) To its credit In the Line of Fire squirms onto eerie psychological terrain It gets into the suppressed neurosis-the morbid blend of nobility and masochism-at the heart of the Secret Service ethos. Yet the way most of this plays out feels flat and familiar. The whole notion of making the killer Eastwoods doppelganger is lifted directly from his 1984 Tightrope another film that paid lip service to dark inner states. Eastwoods bantering romance with a feminist agent (Rene Russo) recalls his (platonic) sparring with Tyne Daly in The Enforcer. And Malkovich enjoyable as he is seems less a creepy believable nut than a pure movie concoction the latest arrogant psycho whispering midnight threats over the phone. The film takes Learys mastermindedness a little too much for granted. I never did understand how he keeps evading government phone taps and though his photograph is finally distributed to agents everywhere he is able to avoid detection simply by wearing glasses and a toupee. These sorts of plausibility issues hardly wreck a thriller-by now we probably all expect them-but they cut down on our level of engagement. By the time In the Line of Fire is half over youve settled back into passive its-only-a-movie mode. A movie is all it is of course but this one would have been even more exciting if it had seduced us into forgetting that.
