Desperate she turns to a seer to try and save her soul while evil forces work to push her to a breaking point. Genre Horror ThrillerDirector Sam RaimiCast Alison Lohman Justin Long If you can sit through the repeated gross-out scenes in ""Drag Me to Hell"" without once closing your eyes cringing or looking away congratulations You may have a career as a biohazard removal/crime scene cleanup worker. I shut my eyes once and diverted my gaze at least twice. I also groaned numerous times muttered ""what the [heck]?"" after one twisted scene and laughed out loud a half-dozen times at the over-the-top madness. This is the most disgusting the scariest and perhaps the funniest movie Ive seen this year. At times I hated it for pushing my buttons so relentlessly and with such obvious touches but I cant deny it I found it entertaining as hell. Even the possessed talking goat. Writer-director Sam Raimi made his horror bones with the ""Evil Dead"" films before hitting it huge with the ""Spider-Man"" franchise. (His surprisingly varied resume also includes the underrated thriller ""A Simple Plan"" and the Kevin Costner baseball movie ""For the Love of the Game."") After spending most of the last decade chronicling the adventures of Peter Parker Raimi returns to his B-movie roots resurrecting an old script he penned with brother Ivan and taking the reins for a fast-paced thrill ride that wastes little time on exposition while topping itself with one repulsive spectacle after another. Yet ""Drag Me"" gets a PG-13 rating because the violence is almost cartoonishly ridiculous. (Anvil meet head.) Its more about the sound of a head snapping than seeing the head snap. When blood gushes in one scene its more reminiscent of Monty Python and ""its just a flesh wound"" than a ""Saw"" film. Sweet-faced Alison Lohman who turns 30 this year but still looks like high school junior gets major points for throwing herself into the role of Chrstine Brown a bright but timid loan officer eyeing an assistant managers job. MacBook Smirk Boy Justin Long the only 30-year-old in Hollywood who looks younger than Lohman is her college professor boyfriend. He is the obligatory Doubting Idiot who keeps crinkling his brow and mocking Christines claims of being cursed. The entire second floor of Christines house will be destroyed by snarling demons tossing her about yet the oblivious boyfriend will show up an hour later and just wait downstairs as she changes into an angelic yellow dress for the big dinner with his snooty parents. (Although he will eventually get to utter the immortal line ""I dont know what I believe anymore."") Heres how the insanity commences. In an effort to impress her boss she denies a loan extension to a dead-eyed phlegm-spewing crazy old gypsy woman who has animalistic fingernails and talks as if shes Bela Lugosis daughter. Wrong move. Next thing you know little Christine is involved in a parking lot cage match battle with the old woman who suddenly has the strength tenacity and vicious instincts of an Ultimate Fighting Champion. This encounter features the first of many scenes in which Christine will be subjected to a disgusting humiliation that will have audiences moaning en masse. Seems Grandma Gypsy has put a curse on Christine and over the next three days Christine will have encounters with a fly that winds up in her stomach cascading embalming fluid spurting blood a fist or two in her throat and other extremely vile creatures and substances. And then the devils going to come and drag her to hell. With the clock ticking on her immortal soul Christine consults with a psychic battles seen and perhaps imaginary demons and ultimately participates in one of the wildest seances ever put on film. Yet she still finds time to keep angling for that promotion Whatta gal. Finally Christine learns what must be done and she does it while enduring even more grotesqueries -- but did it really work? And whos the real villain in this story the scary old lady who couldnt get the bank loan or the seemingly sweet farm girl whos trying to make it in the big city and will compromise her values to get that big promotion? Ah who cares. Its just fun watching the Gross Adventures of Young Christine. POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

Universal Studios By Joe Morgenstern Updated June 5 2009 1201 a.m. ET O joy a horror flick thats smart and funny as well as cringeworthy for all the right reasons. And up to speed on the mortgage crisis too. ""Drag Me to Hell"" was directed by Sam Raimi who has revisited his horror roots after devoting more than half of the current decade to directing the adventures of Spider-Man. (He wrote the script with his brother Ivan Raimi.) The heroine played to sly perfection by Alison Lohman is Christine Brown an ambitious young loan officer bucking for a promotion to assistant branch manager. When an elderly impoverished and majestically repulsive customer named Mrs. Ganush comes in to beg for yet another extension on her home loan Christine hesitates only briefly before turning her down. Given what we now know about the perils of permissive lending practices that decision should have sealed the deal for managerial status. Instead Mrs. Ganush retaliates with an ancient gypsy curse and Christine spends the rest of the movie trying to avoid eternal damnation. I could and will go on about the nature of the curser and the agonies of the cursee. First though a few words of appreciation about craftsmanship. Whatever the genre its always a pleasure to watch good work. This film is cunningly crafted in every detail--direction script performances comic timing special effects--from thunderous start to delicious finish. (The production designer was Steve Saklad and the cinematographer was Peter Deming who shot David Lynchs ""Mulholland Dr."" and ""Lost Highway."") The villainess bless her vileness is played by Lorna Raver whose head shot on the Internet Movie Database shows an attractive woman with a quizzical expression. As Mrs. Ganush shes totally transformed into a werewolfish Transylvanian who gloms onto Christine with her one good eye and copes with a dental impairment--no teeth and bad dentures--by gumming her victims chin at every opportunity. Ms. Lohmans portrayal of the heroine starts with innocence. A wide-eyed farm girl with a sweet smile Christine would seem to be the genres standard babe in jeopardy. Yet shes glad to compromise her principles if that will buy her relief from all the creepy slimy and/or gooey terrors that beset her. In depicting one of them--a fly that strolls into Christines left nostril then promptly emerges from the right one--the movie sets a high standard for computer-generated minimalism. (One hopes for the actors sake that the insect was digital.) ENLARGE Lorna Ravers Mrs. Ganush Universal Studios Justin Long is Christines boyfriend Clay Dalton a psychology professor who nicely fills the need for designated skeptic. (Hes such a rationalist that he drives a Prius.) David Paymer is her anxious boss at the bank branch. Reggie Lee plays her smarmy rival for a better job. Adriana Barraza--she played the Mexican nanny in ""Babel""--is a spirit medium who presides over a seance that involves a talking nanny goat. Dileep Rao is a fortune-teller with a Jungian bent and a genuine gift for predicting the future. I can do that too. I predict that ""Drag Me To Hell"" will delight large audiences in the here and now and have a long and profitable afterlife. Departures Most of the events in Yojiro Takitas ""Departures"" flow from a comical misunderstanding. After a Tokyo orchestra is disbanded an earnest young cellist Daigo seeks a new line of work in the provinces spots a help-wanted ad for a company that deals in departures and assumes it to be some sort of travel agency. In fact the company is a one-man operation that deals in encoffination--the ceremonial preparation of corpses for cremation--and the owner wants to hire an assistant. Still Daigos assumption isnt completely off the mark. The job takes him and his wife Mika (Ryoko Hirosue) on a guided tour to the far country of death and dying with frequent stops for beguiling comedy along the road. ENLARGE Masahiro Motoki as Daigo Kobayashi in the Japanese film Departures. Regent Releasing Heres to humor in all its manifestations whether as the glint in the jaundiced eye of a horror flick or as the indispensable leavening of this gorgeous drama which won an Oscar earlier this year as the best foreign language film of 2008. Daigo is at the outset a chronic screw-up who cant bring himself to tell his wife what he does in his new position cant even get a grip on a cake of soap in a public bath. (Hes there to expunge the chemical smell of his trade.) Slowly though in a film thats mostly slow-paced the self-doubting boy comes into manhood under the tutelage of his boss a consummate professional who can advertise his services with a hucksters flair yet consider them with a philosophers gravity. (Hes played by the wonderfully taciturn Tsutomu Yamazaki who was the trucker Goro in ""Tampopo."") Occasionally the story turns manipulative or self-conscious I could have done without the hero playing his cello in picturesque fields near snow-capped mountains though his musical yearnings perfectly complement the movies main theme of spiritual growth. (Joe Hisaishi did the splendid score.) But the rituals that Daigo learns to perform are literally spellbinding. While the family and friends of the deceased watch silently the encoffiner uses elaborate gestures that might be those of a magician or a sommelier to wash and dress the body yet does it all with exquisite tenderness. In one of the movies most beautiful moments Mika comes to understand Daigos quiet professionalism and to love the soulful man her young husband has become. But beautiful moments abound. In ""Departures"" the contemplation of death prepares the way for an appreciation of life. Summer Hours What a surprising movie week this has proved to be--not one but two profoundly affecting feature films that deal with death among other things. In the case of ""Summer Hours"" a French-language drama by Olivier Assayas the accent is ostensibly on things and thingness--two valuable Corot paintings and a pair of precious Redon panels among myriad objects of art that a dying matriarch Helene (Edith Scob) has amassed in a lovely country house during the course of her life. Yet these objects are as Helene says before she goes only the residue of her life. The filmmakers concern is what theyre really worth--their emotional content rather than their market value--and whether the essence of who she was will live in her loved ones memories. More Film Review Reaching for the Sky Up Fails to Soar The degree of likely remembrance differs from one sibling to another. For the older son Frederic (a superb performance by Charles Berling) Helene has been a maddening presence--all that obsessive and contagious concern for possessions--but clearly as well as painfully an unforgettable one. The daughter Adrienne (Juliette Binoche) feels bereft after Helenes death but wants to loosen her already weakened attachments and will probably do so once she returns to her own life as a designer in Manhattan. The younger son (Jeremie Renier) will feel neither conflict nor nostalgia. A creature of the present and future he lives and works in China where he and his wife send their kids to an English-speaking school. Much of ""Summer Hours"" which was shot by the excellent Eric Gautier feels like a Chekhov play and resonates like a Schubert quartet; its a work of singular loveliness. Though I hate to say so its also saddening in the sense it conveys of a culture as well as a collector passing into oblivion. Yet all is not Chekhovian decline. A sweet-spirited housekeeper Eloise (another superb performance by Isabelle Sadoyan) cherishes a flower vase decorated with bubbles--not because its valuable though it is but because the flowers it holds will keep reminding her of Helene. A teenage granddaughter breaks away from a home invasion by her partying peers long enough to weep albeit briefly because her grandmother is dead and her house has been sold. The girl remembers Helenes history of love and grand passion and may be destined to repeat it. DVD FOCUS Darkman ENLARGE Sam Raimi is best known and best-loved among fans of the horror genre for the trilogy that began in 1981 with ""The Evil Dead"" and included ""Evil Dead II"" (1987) and ""Army of Darkness"" (1992). But ""Darkman"" which he directed more than a decade before doing the first ""Spider-Man"" deserves a special place in the Raimi pantheon. An elegant admixture of horror and humor it stars Liam Neeson as Peyton Westlake a disfigured scientific genius who becomes the tormented antihero of the title. (One torment comes from his synthetic skin which can withstand only brief moments in sunlight.) Spirited Away ENLARGE Joe Hisaishi wrote the music for Hayao Miyazakis masterpiece of modern animation as well as for other Miyazaki classics including ""Castle in the Sky"" ""My Neighbor Totoro"" and ""Kikis Delivery Service."" In ""Spirited Away"" 10-year-old Chihiro finds herself alone in an alternate universe that for all its exotic trappings could be a hinterland of Wonderland or Oz. It is there that she must work at hard dirty tasks--you dont want to know about the Stink-Gods personal hygiene--and there that shes transformed from a frightened spoiled child into a capable courageous young woman. The Flight of the Red Balloon ENLARGE Although Olivier Assayas acknowledges the Chekhovian tonalities of ""Summer Hours"" he also considers it his most Taiwanese film. That reflects his fondness for the work of such directors as the late Edward Yang and of his friend Hou Hsiao-Hsien who took inspiration for this lovely leisurely evocation of daily life in contemporary Paris from Albert Lamorisses classic short ""The Red Balloon."" The story--in which little happens while much is seen and felt--centers on a boy Simon (Simon Iteanu) who true to the films source discovers a red balloon floating near him. His frazzled mother Suzanne is played brilliantly by Juliette Binoche.

Not that youve been AWOL; we know that youve spent the past decade making a few keep-a-straight-face attempts at mainstream entertainment (For Love of the Game The Gift). Plus there were those mondo blockbusters about a web-slinging superhero--the name escapes us--and youve kept megabusy producing remakes of Asian ghost stories. But we hoped that youd eventually return to the gonzo-gory horror flicks that you pioneered. Yknow the kind with Gypsy curses copious bodily fluids and specters that arent afraid of a little soft-shoe. Drag Me to Hell has all of that and more Raimis return to Evil Dead territory is proof that respectability be damned he can still whip up a slapstick splatterfest--albeit a PG-13 one--when the mood strikes. Refusing to extend an old crones mortgage loan a bank clerk (Lohman) is destined to suffer demonic retribution (see title) in three days. Which leaves plenty of time for eyeballs popping out of desserts high-pressurized nosebleeds and a sance that ends with an animatronic possessed goat. You can practically hear the director and his sibling cowriter Ivan Raimi nyuk-nyuk-nyuking to each other as they put the films working-stiff heroine in harms way. Theyre having so much fun laying on the vintage scare tactics that you can forgive Lohmans lack of screen presence and the frequent patches of narrative slackness. When Raimi lets his freak flag fly at full mast as he does during an attack-by-rotten-dentures sequence youre simply happy to bask in the unadulterated pleasures of his fun-house horror.--David Fear Opens Fri.

"Drag Me to Hell reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Drag Me to Hell reviewed. Drag Me to Hell reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 29 2009 1153 AM Go to Hell Sam Raimi can still scare you silly. By Dana Stevens Lorna Raver as Mrs. Ganush in Drag Me To Hell Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi must have been blessed at birth by benevolent Gypsies because the filmmaking brothers (Ivan writes; Sam directs) have had a cosmic stroke of luck with the timing of the release of their brilliantly nasty little horror film Drag Me To Hell (Universal Studios). With the advent of the economic downturn this bloody tale of bank loans and home foreclosure can be read as an allegory for our times lending it a soupcon of highbrow cred. But the best reasons for loving this movie are all lowbrow and shamelessly ahistorical Its gory consistently scream-inducing and funny as well hell. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Christine (Alison Lohman) is a pert blond loan officer at a Los Angeles bank. Shes bright and ambitious (though we note in some deftly sketched character details still insecure about her origins as a chubby farm girl) and she has the perfect boyfriend a smart rich college professor whos desperately devoted to her (and played by the endearing Justin Long who--sorry Justin--will always be the Mac guy to me). Christine is angling for a promotion at work but her boss (David Paymer) makes it clear that to get it shell have start ""making some tough decisions"" about unpaid loans (read cutting people off). And her archrival for the position the unctuous Stu (Reggie Lee) is treating her as if hes already her boss. Advertisement Just at that moment a half-blind old Hungarian woman Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) shows up at Christines desk first asking then begging for a third extension on her mortgage payment. I think you see where this is going To please her boss Christine grits her teeth and forces herself to say no to the piteous womans request. Memo to self in bold font Never do this. Give the Gypsy lady more time. Christine ignores that advice and Mrs. Ganush responds by invoking the ancient curse of the lamia which an Indian-American fortuneteller (Dileep Rao) helpfully explains means that after three days of terrifying visions she will be dragged by a demon down to hell. The frantic machinations by which Christine seeks to forestall this fate make up most of the film She reads up on occult spells pawns all her earthly goods to pay for the services of a medium (Adriana Barraza) and performs acts that she never knew she was capable of (and that this viewer never knew she was capable of laughing at). Raimis scare tactics can be a bit too dependent on abundantly spewed gross substances. (For example Is being repeatedly soaked by embalming fluid while trapped under a corpse really that scary? Isnt the scary part the fact that youre lying under a corpse?) But when Raimi stages a good old-fashioned suspense scene--whats that shadow against the curtain? whos coming up the stairs? oh God is the doorknob turning?--he has no peer. Even those things in Drag Me to Hell that read as cheesy--Alison Lohmans glassy-eyed stare or Christopher Youngs string-heavy Psycho-esque score--work perfectly and seem deliberate on Raimis part. He started off as a director of the ludicrously over-the-top Evil Dead series whose weird alchemy of horror and humor has wielded enormous (and at times pernicious) influence over subsequent masters of gore. Drag Me owes less to contemporary horror-film grammar (""extreme"" Japanese horror sadistic Saw-style butchery etc.) than it does to the thrillers of the 70s and 80s. It harkens back to the kind of scary movies that seem almost innocent now with their earnest occult mumbo-jumbo (think The Exorcist) and terrified but plucky heroines (think Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween). Drag Mes production values are far nicer than those of the Evil Dead movies but beneath its moderately plushy exterior beats that same telltale heart. For the last seven years Raimis been busy making the posh Spidermanmovies--his next installment is scheduled for 2011--and I hope he keeps doing so as that franchise would lose what panache it still possesses without him at the helm. But in between Champagne toasts with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst atop heaping mounds of money Raimi should go slumming more often. Its a pleasure to follow him to hell--and back? Youll see.

He and brother Ivan Raimi have written a rather old-fashioned terror tale full of curses and creaks bumps and shrieks but theyve added a heavy splattering of their trademark dark humor. (Some of the absurdly funny visual gags include creative uses for office supplies a talking goat a persistent fly and an unsuspecting kitty.) The physical comedy is cartoony but in a clever classic way and it never detracts from the genuine suspense. All these contradictions add up to one hell of a ride Youll squirm youll scream youll laugh your butt off and beg for more. Alison Lohmans character the innocent Christine Brown gets way more than she ever could have imagined. A bank loan officer competing for a promotion she denies a creepy old woman an extension on her mortgage loan thinking thats the right decision to impress her boss (David Paymer). Turns out she turned down the wrong customer Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) is a vengeful gypsy who feels so shamed she places a powerful curse on Christine that torments her day and night. Shadows start following her and gusts of wind blow through her doors and windows violently tossing her about the house. (Raimi gets a little repetitive with the shock moments and their accompanying blasts of noise; having said that this is also where his newfound use of CGI comes in handy.) But we could have figured out something was a bit off with Mrs. Ganush by the glass eye rotting fingernails jagged dentures and copious globs of phlegm she hocks up into her dainty handkerchief. She may look frail but she is fearsome; the Raimis have created one memorable villain. Christine tries to extricate herself from this hex with the help of her skeptical but patient boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) as well as a psychic (Dileep Rao) whos in over his head. Rao gets some of the movies best deadpan lines and hes just one example of the inspired supporting casting. Chelcie Ross and Molly Cheek are perfect as Clays WASPy parents who look down on Christine for her farm-girl upbringing and Reggie Lee brings unexpected unctuousness to the role of Stu Christines chief rival for the assistant manager gig. As in Raimis underseen but suspenseful ""A Simple Plan"" ""Drag Me to Hell"" tracks what happens when an ordinary person finds herself in an extraordinary circumstance and how one bad move leads to another and another. Lohman makes this crazy scenario almost relatable because shes just like you and me She probably means well but her ambition leads her down a dangerous path. Youll be glad you got dragged along with her. 2 images Close Sign in Close Sign in Sign in with a linked account facebook yahoo Or use your East Valley Tribune account Username or Email Password Remember me Forgot Submit Need an account?

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Parental Alienation Dave Eggers and Vendela Vidas movie about familial dysfunction would make a perfect book. By David Edelstein Published May 28 2009 ShareThis (Photo Francois Duhamel/Courtesy of Focus Features) First-person novelists tend to have a hard time making the leap to screenwriting since theyre used to putting all the sparkling insights in their narrators heads and not having to deal with dialogue subtext or other characters pesky points of view. The literary power couple Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida knew enough to try to compensate for their lack of drama chops by collaborating on their road movie Away We Go and having dual protagonists a man and a womana give-and-take between first-person novelists as it were. Burt (John Krasinski) and Verona (Maya Rudolph) are in their early thirties poor and rootless living in the sticks near his (narcissistic unhelpful) parents. When Verona gets pregnant the couple decides to fly around the country visiting friends and relatives and exploring prospective home bases Phoenix; Tucson; Madison Wisconsin; Montreal; Miami. When every stopover turns out to be horrific sad or horrifically sad Burt and Verona ponder their future with rising miserywhile I pondered their faces Krasinskis is hard to read behind his beard and the ironic set of his mouth and Rudolphs is vaguely sniffy and pissed-off. Theyre a drag these two. Perhaps their first-person novels would do a better job drawing you in. Sam Mendes of American Beauty and Revolutionary Road directed and hes wrong for these writers and wrong for the open road. For all his fiddling with cameras hes a theater guy His locales are designed not discovered or explored. Travelfinding the self by escaping the selfis central to the novels of Eggers and Vida but Mendes knows where hes going before he gets there. And so the subject of Away We Go turns out to be not travel but child-rearing which is at best well-meaning and anguished and at worst downright monstrous. A different director might have introduced some air and softenedinstead of intensifiedthe writers snobbish portraits of parents from hell. Although its fun to see Allison Janney trumpet expletives and treat her kids with riotous indifference and Maggie Gyllenhaal (pictured as a feminist academic) breathlessly denounce the sadistic isolation induced by baby strollers their scenes are still depressing. Everything we know about their characters we learn from their first moments onscreenonly the scale of their egocentricity is surprising. After all the cartoony satire Away We Go turns somber; Verona stops running from the pain of her parents deaths; and the couple realizes that home isnot to put too fine a point on itwhere the heart is. Also that we should listen to our kids instead of projecting things onto them. The last scene ought to be deeply moving but Mendes has to jack up the volume of the music to convey its momentousness. Yet I have faith that the perfect ending existsa closing paragraph to die for locked away in the writers heads. As the early twentieth century naive or modern primitive painter Seraphine de Senlis in Martin Provosts sublime drama Seraphine Yolande Moreau is magically transparent yet utterly mysterious. Whats in her head? You dont knowbut you almost know from glimmers in her face and from the heightened textures of the French countryside through which she toddles in a state of rapture. A plain ruddy woman of indeterminate age Seraphine scrubs floors and washes linens and is in her mute drudgery exaggeratedly self-effacing. But when shes not working shes joyfully perched on tree branches or in her dark little apartment painting still lifes that suggest motionsunflowers imbued with a radiant energy. You might think you have her pegged when she invokes the self-abnegating Saint Therese but Seraphine turns out to be anything but egoless. When the German critic and art dealer Wilhelm Uhde (Ulrich Tukur) effuses over her work and begins to sell her paintings to Parisians she accepts the prospect of wealth and celebrity with unnerving alacrity. The voices in her head have predicted it after all. Seraphine is one of the most evocative films about an artist Ive ever seenand in its treatment of madness one of the least condescending. Seraphine sings when she paints or moves in her flat-topped hat through the rolling green fields and Moreaus voice is not in any recognizable keyits barely musical. Yet its revelatory an imperfect translation of the inner life that finds its perfect translation in painting. Provost fades to black after many scenes his rhythms weighty without being ponderous the ideal state in which to enter the movies canvas and study Moreaus Seraphine who is so alien and so open. Sam Raimis return to the gutbucket-horror genre Drag Me to Hell comes on like 3-D no glasses needed Demons surge into your face while their maxi-decibel roars cut through you. This old-fashioned mindless scare picture gets ferociously to the point. Gypsies spit curses (plus viscous saliva); evil spirits make infernal rackets; mediums chant fiercely to ward off spectral bombardments; and the Earth splits open for ashen hands to drag poor shrieking souls into the flames. Its Grand Guignol grand opera. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Dont waver dont bargain; anything short of yes could put you on a fast track to damnation as surely as a broken mirror will bring you seven years of bad luck.Look at what happens to Christine a very good egg boiled to perfection by circumstance and a lot of good work by Alison Lohman. One bad decision and suddenly director Sam Raimi throws her under the bus of his terrific new horror film ""Drag Me to Hell.""If youve been worried that Raimis decade spent spinning the ""Spider-Man"" web might have caused him to go soft well stop. The director who gave us the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy is back with a vengeance that rivals the one-eyed gypsy I warned you about.With that fire in his belly Raimis ""Drag Me to Hell"" does everything we want a horror film to do It is fearsomely scary wickedly funny and diabolically gross three stomach-churning states that argue for taking a pass on the 10 box of popcorn. Which also makes the movie an excellent economic investment in these tough times.I mention the economy because Raimi has made it an issue at the heart of ""Drag Me to Hell"" in the spirit of campy cultural commentary that good horror can do so well. The director and his brother Ivan began the script 10 years ago before Peter Parkers many tribulations in Spidey tights sidelined it. If the Raimis really are as prescient as ""Drag Me"" would suggest Id like to put in a good word for them to be added to the Obama economic recovery team.You see Christine is a lending agent at a bank and ambition has made her desperate for a promotion. The gypsy is old Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) who just wants a little of the candy on Christines desk and another extension on her home loan. Sounds reasonable to me. And it did to Christine too until her boss (David Paymer) hints that if she is serious about that promotion . . .So good decent Christine goes against her better judgment and denies Mrs. Ganushs request. Bad choice Christine. Before she can begin what will be a long string of ""Im sorrys"" that become ""How dare yous"" theres a curse on her head and the nightmare begins. Not too many scenes later you may find yourself wondering if the title was meant to refer to Christine or the rest of us.Against all the craziness that any decent ghost story conjures up there has to be the rational voice. In ""Drag Me"" it comes from the Mac guy Justin Long who Im sure will one day have a role that will turn his Apple ad stint into nothing more than a footnote but this wont be it.As the very proper professor Clay Dalton Long is torn between what he knows is reality and his increasingly delusional girlfriends belief that shes got just a few days to fend off the devil whos nipping at her heels. Clay doesnt have what it takes to fight off demons anyway assuming he even believed in them but hes a good boyfriend willing to humor Christine even when he thinks shes completely lost her mind.In Mrs. Ganush Raimi and Raver have created a horrific otherworldly fiend that can hold her own against the best of the Freddy Kruegers of the world. This is one woman who can roar (still I do worry that given the slimy dentures projectile vomiting and that really bad temper Raver wont be doing lunch in town any time soon). Other evil forces are churned up by that angry curse and rise too; the particularly deadly dark spirit called Lamia is the one to worry about.Though the film has echoes of Raimis earlier and much loved ""Evil Dead"" series -- especially what he does with mischief-making chill-inducing wind -- ""Drag Me to Hell"" should not be dismissed as yet another horror flick just for teens. The filmmakers have given us a 10-story winding staircase of psychological tension that is making very small circles near the end. Though Christine is technically the one doing the climbing its nearly impossible not to feel like shes dragging us right along with her which is after all the point.There are all manner of grisly things that Christine must deal with before it is finished but its really grisly-lite nothing like the torture-porn of the ""Hostel"" series or the bodies-on-meat-hooks style of sadomasochism you find in ""Hellraiser.""When Raimi says Lohman is in virtually every scene except the opening historical note hes not exaggerating. In broad strokes because you should experience the fear and loathing of the specifics for yourself she must decide exactly how far she is willing to go to stay alive. There is one point that risks having sympathy turn to antipathy and Im betting that a contingent of the audience wont be able to get past it but Lohman with her strange blend of apple pie sweetness and business school pragmatism is the right one for the job making sure most of us stay on Christines side.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESHalloween activities in the L.A. areaOctober 27 2011Sam Raimi has horror in his clutchesMay 28 2009Ogres soldiers gorillasMay 9 2004Heading Fast and Furiously Into FallSeptember 9 2001MORE STORIES ABOUTHorrorChristineGypsyCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2009/may/29/entertainment/et-drag29,200,dragmetohell10,dragmetohell,latimes

Its . . . Poltergoat ""Spider-Man"" director Sam Raimis tongue-in-cheek horror flick ""Drag Me to Hell"" returns him to where he got started ""Evil Dead""-style. Raimi doesnt care whether youre laughing or screaming. As a young loan officer (the talented Alison Lohman who gives this material better than it deserves) seeking a promotion at her bank forecloses on a Gypsy crone who curses her to hell we cant (SCREECH) go more than a couple of minutes (SQUAWK) without a skull-jarring (ROOOOAR) audio effect. The movie is not without some cheap thrills but it works on the same principle as a fast-food joint or a hair conditioner. Its all about volume. The story despite all the poring through ancient texts and attempts to dress it up in fancy myths could play out in five minutes. The banker dragging her boyfriend (Justin Long) to visit a fortune-and-exposition teller (Dileep Rao) learns that the Gypsy gained full cursing rights when she ripped a button off the girl and gave it back to her. Give away the button and youll pass along the curse to the next victim. (Me Id sew the button inside my wallet and ride the subway with the billfold sticking out of my pocket.) That the film puts off revealing this bit of common sense for no good reason suggests its original title was ""Drag Me to the 90-Minute Mark."" The banking drama (""I met with their CFO and presented a formula for restructuring some of their long-tem debt"") turns out to have nothing to do with anything. Nor does a seance which despite much crashing scenery leaves the situation at status quo. Nor do secondary characters. Nor does the back story (the loan officer used to be fat and live on a farm but she doesnt speak goat or anything). Virtually every scene relies on gross-outs Theres a firehose-strength nose bleed and an arm down someones throat. The Gypsy witch loses her dentures and slobbers on the heroines face. Someone vomits a kitten. Someone else gets attacked by an evil handkerchief. If the Gypsy woman could send a goat-ghost out to ruin peoples lives and generally terrify them why couldnt she have used this little trick to blackmail her way to a fortune or at least enough cash to make her mortgage payments? If the object of her curse is to accomplish the imperative suggested by the title why doesnt it do so right away rather than goofing around with harmless scare tactics for an hour? ""Drag Me to Hell"" is pure cheese. Goat cheese. kyle.smithnypost.com DRAG ME TO HELL Grossly nonsensical. Running time 99 minutes. Rated PG-13 (violence frightening images).

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Horror Movies Entertainment News Alison Lohman in ""Drag Me to Hell."" Consider yourself forewarned Projectile nosebleeds stapled eyeballs and rivers of green and yellow phlegm flowing forth from unsavory places are just some of the grisly pleasures to be found in Sam Raimis comedy-horror film ""Drag Me to Hell."" As Raimis fans know long before he became a giant Hollywood player with the ""Spider-Man"" movie franchise he made a name for himself with the ""Evil Dead"" pictures and other assorted B-movie entertainments like ""Army of Darkness."" ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a similarly modest project and its all the more enjoyable for it. This is a brash mischievous little number Raimi (who co-wrote the script with his brother Ivan) gives his devilish nature free rein. But although ""Drag Me to Hell"" has its share of violence (the slapstick kind) numerous ""jump"" moments and a great deal of obviously phony gore unlike so much contemporary horror its devoid of sadism and mean-spiritedness. The looseness Raimi allows himself here results in an especially joyous kind of filmmaking the sort where the filmmakers delight in scaring us (and making us laugh) becomes part of the movies fabric.""Drag Me to Hell"" opens with a flashback to 1969 Pasadena in which a desperate Mexican couple bring their cursed child to a medium (played by Adriana Barraza) who fails to prevent the lad from being swallowed into the abyss of hell. She vows that someday shell get another crack at the demon-spirit who caused all the trouble. Cut to present-day Southern California where we meet spunky farm girl-turned-loan officer Christine (Alison Lohman). Eager to move past her modest pig-princess roots Christine hopes to be next in line for a promotion at her bank. But her boss (played by the fine character actor David Paymer) indicates that a brown-nosing colleague an Asian-American who goes by the intentionally incongruous name Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee) is most likely going to get the job. Christine wide-eyed and with a perpetually quivering lower lip thinks her chances for advancement will be improved if she acts like a tough businesslady. So when an elderly woman with ratted hair and a milky eye (played by the fabulous Lorna Raver) shows up at the bank begging for an extension on her mortgage payments efficient little Christine after weighing the options for all of 20 seconds tells her no. You Might Also Like And that of course is where all of Christines problems begin and where all of those disgusting bodily fluids start flowing freely. Not even Christines sweet caring academic boyfriend (Justin Long) is of much use though he tries. Raimi keeps making the gags broader and broader as if to see how much he can get away with. And he gets away with just about everything although cat lovers in particular might be dismayed by one scene. (For those who want to keep every plot detail a surprise the following constitutes a spoiler so you might want to stop reading here.) Raimi apparently scoured the earth to find the cutest stripiest kitten ever only to give him an ignoble end. But even so Raimi advances through the scene discreetly (nothing happens on-camera). And the idea writ comically large is that hes contrasting the kittens complete innocence -- plus did I mention his amazing cuteness? -- with a human characters ugliness and depravity. So Raimis transgression against kittenkind is forgiven. But just this once. As for the rest ""Drag Me to Hell"" is somewhat plotless though like many horror movies it does have a strong moral underpinning. As the clueless and really not-very-nice Christine learns the hard way we must treat others with compassion and maintain a sense of humility. Because if we dont someones yellowy oozing eyeball is going to show up in the piece of cake were trying to eat. If that isnt motivation enough for trying to be a good person then I dont know what is.

But for cult-horror junkies hell always be the man behind the three Evil Dead flicks arguably the funniest cheesiest most repulsive series in the history of splatter. He left that genre behind in 1993. He now returns there with Drag Me to Hell a blessedly goofy ode to gothic schmaltz that never pretends to be anything it isnt. Start with the title a straightforward imperative that promises B-movie levels of supernatural hooey. And it delivers Here lies a movie about a cornfed blonde (Alison Lohman) whos cursed by a Gypsy crone (Lorna Raver) and winds up getting smacked around by an invisible horned demon. It has a seance scene for Petes sake. It has a black cat named Hecuba. It even has an exhumation in a graveyard on a dark and rainy night complete with a few noodly organ riffs and dramatic crashes of lightning. So anyone who buys a ticket for Drag Me to Hell expecting a subtle reinvention of the horror oeuvre is deluding herself. It is what it is. And if you can stomach the projectile-sputum gags and stapled-eyelid attack scene its hilarious. Is it as hilarious as the Evil Deads? Almost. Is it as gory? No way -- this is a PG-13 film were talking about so it lacks the slapstick dismemberment and endless fountains of blood. There is a beaut of a nosebleed however. And Ravers Mrs. Ganush does barf up all manner of gook on Lohmans Christine a bank loan officer who wishes like hell shed given the old hag that third extension on her mortgage. They all play their roles with hammy gusto. Lohman goes from zero to freaked in seconds but she also manages some deftly comic bloodlust when things get truly nasty. Raver is a vision of toothless retaliation At one point Mrs. Ganush loses her dentures and proceeds to gum the poor girl into submission. Dileep Rao is a sympathetic clairvoyant with a fondness for Jung and in the movies one straight role Justin Long plays Christines skeptical but supportive boyfriend. His job is to doubt look handsome and say things like ""Thank God youre OK"" Raimi directs with a forthright savvy that feels like joy. He penned the screenplay with his brother Ivan (who also co-wrote the third Evil Dead Army of Darkness) and you can almost hear their giggles on the soundtrack. Visually the film is cleaner and pricier than Raimis early works; it also forsakes stop-motion for a bit of C.G.I. though it looks bargain-basement compared with most genre fare these days. The demon appears mainly in shadows accompanied by droning sound effects and diabolic strings in Christopher Youngs marvelous dissonant score. Fans should be on the alert for Raimis iconic yellow Oldsmobile. They should also keep their eyes peeled for the moment when a fly buzzing ominously around Christine lands on the lens for a close-up.

A fly buzzes near her lands on her face crawls into her right nostril. After a few beats it emerges from her left nostril and purposefully presses itself into her closed mouth. Itall stay inside for a while but not forever. Drag Me to Hell -- a great genre title for an O.K. genre movie -- is the latest from Sam Raimi who made zillions with his Spider-Man movies but is revered by horrorphiliacs for another trilogy his cheapo-creepo Evil Dead movies. Taking a break from A-movie budgets subjects and actors Raimi and his brother Ivan concocted a script about the effects of a gypsy curse on a basically nice person who does One Bad Thing. Inspired by the tone of B-movie scare epics of the 50s theyve made a slick mostly predictable homage-pastiche that itself rates about a B-. Christine (Matchstick Mans Alison Lohman) is a friendly efficient 20-something career gal with a caring slightly pompous boyfriend (Justin Long from the Apple commercials) who just got a job as a professor but whose real function in the film is to scoff at the existence of the satanic forces pestering Christine and to be absent or ignorant whenever bad stuff happens. As the loan officer at an L.A. bank she has to consider a nutsy crones request for an extension on a home loan. The old lady a Mrs. Ganush (the aptly named Lorna Raver) doesnt have much collateral a glass eye false teeth that keep slipping out and enough phlegm to fill the Rose Bowl. Reluctantly and to help her secure a promotion Christine turns down the loan. Apparently Christine doesnt realize shes in a horror film where the first law is to avoid pissing off a crazy lady with a wandering eye. That evening after work in a parking garage that of course has not another soul passing through it for minutes on end our heroine is attacked by the old lady. At the end of the kind of combat scene Mickey Rourke didnt have to endure in The Wrestler Mrs. G. snatches a button off Christines coat and hands it back with the promise that shell be hearing from the Lamia. A storefront psychic advisor (Dileep Rao) explains that the Lamia is a demon who toys sadistically with his victims for three days then pretty much drags them down to Hell. Thus is the logic of horror movies. Its a doctrine that Raimi devoutly observes he being as old-fashioned a scare maker as the Lady Ganush is an intoner of maledictions. This is the sort of film where the wind portentously rustles leaves only Christine can see moving; where pots and pans rattle on their own; where every door creaks and violins go tremulous in a John Cagean symphony of noises; where nosebleeds reach Niagara volume; where the shadow of a horned cloven-hoofed creature proceeds up the stairs toward the heroines bedroom; and where to get rid of a curse you must dig up a grave and pin the button on a crazy person whos dead -- but not that dead. After a while Raimis attentiveness to genre formula becomes almost reassuring. You know This Awful Thing is next on the agenda. But speaking as a moviegoer and not as a critic Im obliged to confess that when the first image of the demon flashed onscreen I got a jolt to my nervous system that was more than a seismic shiver -- it felt exactly like a deep electric shock. I could almost hear the Raimis murmur ""Another satisfied customer."" Its not even a spoiler alert to pass along this warning to those of you sitting in the theater at the very end If you suddenly wonder ""Hey nobody got dragged to hell in this movie"" be assured that the Raimis deliver on their title. They guarantee that people will leave the theater knowing who the hero-victim will be in the all-but-inevitable Drag Me to Hell Again Next Summer. And to all the bank officers with billions in stimulus handouts and the millions of begging customers Never say no especially to crazy old ladies. Dont you dare say no.

"Drag Me to Hell What a drag | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsDrag Me to Hell What a dragApplauding Sam Raimi for returning to his schlock horror roots is to me like cheering a Big Mac for tasting the same as it always does.Lorna Raver puts a chokehold on a screaming Alison Lohman in a scene from the new horror flick Drag Me to Hell out in theatres today.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. May 29 2009 Drag Me to Hell (out of 4)Starring Alison Lohman Justin Long Lorna Raver Dileep Rao and David Paymer. Directed by Sam Raimi. 98 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Applauding Sam Raimi for returning to his schlock horror roots is to me like cheering a Big Mac for tasting the same as it always does.Sure its fun that Raimi took a break from counting his Spider-Man loot to bang out a quickie slasher strongly reminiscent of his Evil Dead beginnings.But couldnt Drag Me to Hell which Raimi co-wrote with his bro Ivan have been just a little bit more imaginative? Apart from the evocative title which is a great nod to 50s drive-in fare the film is as predictable as a meal beneath the golden arches.Demonic possession unleashed by strange incantation? Check.Buckets of gore and various flavours of vomit? Check.1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 gratuitously used as prop? Check.Plot written on back of postcard? Check and double check.In many ways its Evil Dead 4 which may explain the critical huzzahs from Cannes to California with a gender flip for minor variety. This time the dead-dodging protagonist is a woman rather than the hapless hero played so memorably and hilariously by Raimi regular Bruce Campbell.Pity that the woman is Alison Lohman a woeful actress who seems to have been chosen solely for her resemblance to Spider-Mans Kirsten Dunst (Raimi is one freaky cat). As much as I enjoy the thought of Lohman being dragged to hell - I hold her responsible for the failure of Atom Egoyans Where the Truth Lies - shes as exciting to watch as a sack of hammers. Her character Christine is just too dumb and innocent to warrant the supernatural abuse dealt out to her after she unwittingly runs afoul of a vengeful gypsy crone named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver).Eager to prove to her grasping bank boss (David Paymer) that she has the cojones to dodge bad loans Christines bad timing has her turning down a mortgage extension for Mrs. Ganush when the old hag comes begging.For acting like a bureaucrat rather than a saint Christines punishment is to spend the next 90 minutes attempting to dodge the curse of the Lamia a body-snatching entity from hell that holds big-time grudges and wont take ""no"" for an answer. Not even the blood sacrifice suggested by a street-corner swami (Dileep Rao) appeases the grabby ghouls. (Note to cat lovers be ready to gaze downward into popcorn bag.)One might argue Christine is already facing perpetual damnation by agreeing to marry her drippy boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) who takes forever to figure things out. Having Lohman and Long co-starring in the same movie is like being banished to the cinema circle of Dantes Inferno.Part of the problem with Drag Me to Hell is that its not 1981 anymore the year The Evil Dead rebooted the horror genre. Special effects have gotten a whole lot less special in the intervening decades. Raimi used to have to use ingenuity to get his lo-fi shocks; now he just has to flip a computer switch.But my biggest beef with Drag Me to Hell is that its just not very funny. With the exception of Raimis depiction of the Lamia as a talking goat the laughs just dont come as freely as they used to.Too bad he couldnt have paired the goat with Lars von Triers talking fox from Antichrist so that - and I quote the fox - ""chaos reigns."" But I guess he has to leave something for the inevitable sequel.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Originally conceived as a short story way back in 1990 Drag Me to Hell has had a long and strange gestation which might explain its repeated references to There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly.Inside a mock-gothic pile all hell breaks loose as female medium Shaun San Dena (Adriana Barraza) struggles to save a young boy from the malevolent force unleashed by a gypsys curse. This brilliantly staged prologue seems to herald the Second Coming of Sam Raimi but the film as a whole never quite lives up to its throat-grabbing opening. With one eye on the vacant assistant managers job ambitious loans officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) refuses to extend the mortgage of an old gypsy lady Mrs Ganush (Lorna Raver). Christine blames her boss (David Paymer) but the gimlet-eyed crazy lady sees all. Shamed by having to beg on bended knee Mrs Ganush fixes Christine with her beady peeper and warns Soon it will be you who comes begging to me. The slighted womans campaign of terror involves the projectile vomiting of blood maggots and green slime a slice of cake with a swivelling eyeball implanted in it and the summoning of a black goat. A late replacement for Juno star Ellen Page the sparky Lohman  seizes the lead role with both hands and confidently makes it her own. As does the aptly named Raver whose vengeance starts with cackling laughter then spirals upwards into imaginative spitefulness. The flashy pyrotechnics make up for a plot that is riddled with holes and there is a wickedly funny gag about the possibility of ameliorative kitten-sacrifice. But the crude eye for an eye morality recalls an average EC Comics story and you dont need a crystal ball to predict the wicked twist in the tale.

What were they thinking? This and the style of the opening credits left me wondering for the next quarter of an hour whether this film was going to be a comedy but hilarity frankly never materialised. There might have been one or two laughs but in essence this is not a funny film. There was the occasional moment of fright and horror but generally it was more of a slime-fest of yucky maggot-spewing and things in that vein. A limited dose of real horror an extremely limited dose of comedy an unambitious dose of more general drama and character exploration - all in all it really leaves you wondering what the point of this film is supposed to be. The acting was perfectly reasonable and most of the dialogue was plausible although at least one of the characters parts (Stus) is inconsistently scripted for no particular reason (Stu- strong/weak) and possibly Shaun San Denas as well (payment v. personal quest - or was the payment 3rd party fraud?). The [absence of any] reaction among the mourners to what happens at the wake lacks all credibility and anyway what happens there is just ludicrous. Some of the special effects were good but others (especially involving a particular animal) looked like something out of the 1980s and detracted from rather than adding to the film. The film does have redeeming moments especially towards the end and the ending itself is effective though it is certainly not the one that I would have chosen and the twist is certainly predictable in the sense that I was wondering well in advance whether it was going to materialise. The lead actress is very pretty and her character is despite her faults endearing. If you are an immature teenage boy barely old enough to view this film legally you may enjoy the element of yuck. If not - well its touch and go whether Id recommend watching it for free but as paid-for entertainment Im sorry there has to be something better. Really they could have done something much better with this.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 10 2009stephen hodgesFeaturedwell this film will make you jump about every minute and is quite funny also in parts as for the acting i just wish what happens at the end would happen alot sooner.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 7 2009oldbritFeaturedI dont usually go to horror films - they scare me.

Christine[lohan ] is a rather callous young loan officer from a Los Angeles bank who evicts a hapless old woman in a tyrannical turn from her house with tragic results and receives a supernatural curse from the dead woman where she has three days to save her soul or be despatched to hell . Raimi has orchestrated the ensuing mayhem as only he can in an audio-visual feast rendered as a masterwork with vibrant editing and superb angular camera work and sound effects that will leave you mesmerized acoustically . this is dynamic humorous horror that shocks disturbs and entertains and most vitally has a morality imbued in its message of doom . the satire on the banks and their lending practices is relevant to the crunch time but it is also given a new leash of life with trivial touches where dancing ghosts turn into fireballs and a common house fly scares the wits out of your consciousness . he can scare you when you least expect it and old croons emerge in the most unpredictable predicaments possible with shocking effects . nothing or no one is spared from kittens to elegant dinner table banquets and cars become a metaphor of gloom and destruction in the most tongue in cheek horror in years to hit the screen . it is not Evil dead but a rather contemporary tale of Immorality embedded in a tale of macabre mortality and it works physically and psychologically too . a refreshing exorcism performed in a scary seance by a clever and innovative cinematic medium called RAIMI .FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 29 2009JayFeaturedMe and my girlfriend saw this last night it was quite an awsum film but it kinda ruined it with the slapstick jokes it had its jumpy moments which was quite cool its a good film and id reccomend it )FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 29 2009JayFeaturedMe and my girlfriend saw this last night it was quite an awsum film but it kinda ruined it with the slapstick jokes it had its jumpy moments which was quite cool its a good film and id reccomend it )FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMay 28 2009KyleFeaturedI am going to see this film tomorrow nd it looks fairly good but by the comments you over people have put I am starting to have second thoughts nevertheless I shall still go and see it and have a jolly good time By the way I dont really speak or write like this I just wanted to do it for something to do.

The direction was a deftly achieved throwback to older American horror films but NOT scary. I couldnt engage with the more absurd elements of the plot and I really didnt care for the characters. The disappointment with this film was largely due to nostalgic critics hailing this as the ""best horror in decades"" and I felt that it really wasnt. Im sure fans of The Shining The Thing Halloween The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 28 Days Later Descent etc will have a serious problem accepting that this fairly entertaining not-very-scary (aside from of course the stuff in all of our nightmares - loud noises) and very oddball film.

This hellaciously effective B-movie comes with a handy moral tucked inside its scares laughs and Raimis specialty the scare/laugh hybrid. Moral Be nice to people. More specifically Do not foreclose on the old Gypsy woman or itll be draggin time. Raimis resume is more interesting than people tend to remember. Have you seen for example ""Evil Dead 2"" or its follow-up ""Army of Darkness""? If you havent you should; theyre quite mad and quite fantastic. Raimi knows how to modulate his technique as with the coolly controlled morality tale ""A Simple Plan"" but hes a firm believer in the power of an active expressive camera as well as the value of insinuation. In ""Drag Me to Hell"" a lace hankie of all things turns into a wraithlike portent of doom. Horror fans shouldnt worry about an excess of subtlety; the ook flows freely here and theres a knock-down drag-out melee in a parking garage thatll be hard to top at the movies this year certainly as far as knock-down drag-out parking garage melees go. Alison Lohman plays Christine an L.A. loan officer who makes a bad judgment call at the bank one day in an attempt to curry favor with her boss (David Paymer). For not granting an extension on the home-loan payments owed by Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver who really is a raver) Christine becomes the target of a serious serious Hungarian cuss-out (""You shame me""). Before long the demons of Hades are manifesting themselves and making Christines life difficult. Maggots old-Gypsy-lady drool embalming fluid gushing out of a corpses mouth--Christines always getting hit with something in this picture. Lohman can be good and she can be bad (terrible in fact in ""Where the Truth Lies"") but in ""Drag Me to Hell"" shes just right. The actress has a winning way of slightly under-responding to each new manifestation that jumps up out of nowhere. (We get a few too many of these bits; even the Jumping Out of Nowhere League may be growing weary of this gimmick by now.) Justin Long plays Christines skeptical but supportive boyfriend. The plot explicators--a psychic and a medium played by Dileep Rao and Adriana Barraza respectively--do their thing with honest conviction while Raimis special-effects folks do theirs. ""Drag Me to Hell"" throws a lot at the screen sticky or not. But unlike so much at the multiplex these days (""Wolverine"" for example) this low-down number doesnt give you a computer-generated-imagery headache. Richly scored by composer Christopher Young who comes up with some ripping solo Gypsy-violin lines Raimis film favors simple pleasures a silhouette of a demon sliding under a door or across a wall or an ill wind that almost (but doesnt quite) take the shape of something concretely terrifying. Will the target audience go for it? I hope so. I hope the nations 17-year-olds arent so benumbed by ""Saw"" ""Hostel"" and humorless remakes of humorless better-made Japanese horror films that theyve become indifferent to exuberant well-paced trash. A little wit to go with the dread goes a long way with me. Hope Im not alone.MPAA rating PG-13 (for sequences of horror violence terror disturbing images and language)Running time 139. Starring Alison Lohman (Christine); Justin Long (Clay); Lorna Raver (Mrs. Ganush); Dileep Rao (Rham); David Paymer (Mr. Jacks); Adriana Barraza (Shaun San Dena) Directed by Sam Raimi; written by Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi; produced by Rob Tapert and Grant Curtis.

This is not the stuff of high drama unless youre Sam Raimi and trust that your audience will delight in seeing how many disgusting things you can splash into Christines mouth. Drag Me to Hell is incredibly simple and incredibly fun--its spark comes from contrasting Christines banality against the black demon goat unleashed on her by a gypsy witch furious that her house has been repossessed. (Yes this is the first horror flick of the mortgage crisis.) This is great pulp and Lohman is game for everything. She makes a hilariously pitiable victim and a credible forged heroine; when a psychic (Dileep Rao) advises an animal sacrifice we know shell tremble--shes a vegetarian--but we also keep a watchful eye on her kitten. 0 Comments Be the first to comment You must be logged in to post a comment.

Video by Universal Pictures>> LAUNCH VIDEO PLAYER Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Dan Kois Special to The Washington Post Friday May 29 2009 In each of the two great movies opening this weekend a crotchety old person faces the loss of the family home to cold impersonal capitalism. On which film should you the viewer spend your hard-earned money? Well if you think youd enjoy seeing the elderly hero spirit away his home in an inspiring ode to adventure and friendship you should see ""Up."" On the other hand if youd rather watch the old person viciously attack a loan officer tear out chunks of her hair and place a horrifying Gypsy curse on her soul then see ""Drag Me to Hell."" How angry are you feeling about the economy anyway? This StoryA Hell of a Good TimeTalk Can Hell Beat Up at the Box Office?Summer Movie GuideDrag Me to HellFind Showtimes TicketsView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Sam Raimis return to horror filmmaking is a satisfyingly terrifyingly old-fashioned thriller and chiller all right. Its mix of horror and humor has much more in common with his legendary ""Evil Dead"" series than with the ""Spider-Man"" movies hes spent the past half-decade lucratively helming. It comes complete with a plucky heroine an ancient curse and bodily fluids sprayed about willy-nilly. As in the best horror movies ""Drag Me to Hell"" keeps the audience on the edge of hysteria throughout so that every thump sets the heart racing and every joke earns a slightly out-of-control laugh. So expertly does Raimi (who also wrote the film with his brother Ivan) pull the strings on the viewer that by the end youll even find yourself cheering for the loan officer (Alison Lohman) who takes an old ladys house away. As ""Drag Me to Hell"" begins that loan officer Christine Brown is at a crossroads. Her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) loves her but his upper-crust parents think shes a hick from the sticks. Her boss (David Paymer) is dangling a promotion but an office suck-up (Reggie Lee) might steal it from her. So when an old woman Mrs. Ganush (the fearless Lorna Raver) appears at her desk pleading for a little more time to pay off her mortgage Christine hardens her heart and denies the request. As it turns out its not a good idea to foreclose on a Gypsy sorceress with demons at her command. After a very scary encounter with Mrs. Ganush in the parking garage Christine begins hearing voices seeing visions and suffering attacks from invisible foes. Clay may scoff but a psychic (Dileep Rao) confirms that Christine is being stalked by a demon and in three days shell be pulled into the underworld forever. A good scare is all about rhythm and Raimi is a masterly conductor. As Christines curse progresses Raimi draws out the tension of each demon attack using agonizingly long slow takes and ominous sound effects to drive Christines panic -- and ours -- to a fever pitch. And then everything gets . . . quiet. And then all hell breaks loose. But just as youve become acclimated to ""Drag Me to Hells"" loud-quiet-loud structure -- just when you think that as in a Pixies song you can safely predict when the screams will come -- Raimi throws you a change-up springing a scare when you least expect it. The frightening scenes in ""Drag Me to Hell"" occur in darkness and in daylight in creepy old mansions and spooky graveyards but also in brightly lit bank branches. Anything can be scary A handkerchief. A cellphone. Even a housefly plays a central and squeal-inducing role. Awash in phlegm blood maggots and even embalming fluid ""Drag Me to Hell"" is nonetheless refreshingly free of the kind of cruelly inventive torture that has characterized recent horror franchises. In fact ""Drag Me to Hell"" is the rare horror movie that can be survived by people who normally cant take horror movies. Its outlandish enough that its unlikely to cause nightmares (after all when are you going to foreclose on a witch?) and Raimi leavens the movie with laughs albeit dark ones. (Suffice it to say that adorable kittens whether living or portrayed on iconic motivational posters have rarely been put to more grimly humorous use than in ""Drag Me to Hell."") And the movies sucker-punch ending will leave even experienced horror movie fans amazed at Raimis nerve. What elevates ""Drag Me to Hell"" above the level of exemplary horror movie -- what makes it a garish and loud work of pop art -- is its mix of inventive supernatural gross-outs and carefully observed everyday details. And not just in its treatment of Americas mortgage crisis. For many viewers the movies most unnerving scene wont be a demon attack at all but Christines awkward first dinner with Clays snooty parents. Its excruciating to watch the four of them making small talk around a formal dining room table and when the walls started shaking and an eyeball appeared in Christines cake I found myself relaxing a little bit. Whew I thought as the blood spurted forth. Finally I can stop covering my eyes and just let Sam Raimi scare the hell out of me. Drag Me to Hell (96 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sequences of horror violence terror disturbing images and language. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  A Hell of a Good Time Summer Movie Guide Find Showtimes Tickets Drag Me to Hell Talk Can Hell Beat Up at the Box Office?",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/28/AR2009052803698.html,200,dragmetohell20,dragmetohell,washingtonpost

""Drag Me To Hell"" Movie Review -- Every director has his influences -- John Ford or grand opera John Woo or impressionist paintings. For Sam Raimi they can pretty much be boiled down to cartoons and the Three Stooges. His ""The Evil Dead"" is what first caught fans eyes in 1981 and had many people pegging him as a straight-forward horror director. But what really appealed to Raimi were the films off-the-wall visuals; what he enjoyed in its sequels was the slapstick horror. Drag Me to Hell (PG-13) Universal (99 min.) Directed by Sam Raimi. With Alison Lohman. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys Rating THREE STARS Rating note The film contains constant graphic violence gruesome images and some strong language. Since then Raimi has thrown a few curveballs -- from the ""Fargo""-like ""A Simple Plan"" (Raimi is a longtime Coen Bros. cohort) to the hugely successful ""Spider-Man"" franchise. Hes tried a number of genres (and become a very prolific producer). But when you think of ""a Sam Raimi Film"" you think about the underrated ""Darkman"" the offbeat ""The Quick and the Dead"" the over-the-top ""Army of Darkness"" -- Looney Tunes action slapstick violence and a few nyuk-nyuk punchlines. You think about a film like ""Drag Me to Hell."" A quick-and-dirty interlude before he gets back to work on yet another ""Spider-Man"" this back-to-beasties B-movie features our cultures latest monster the unfeeling loan officer. Actually shes not a bad person. But she does one cold thing Given the choice to let an old woman stay in her home or impress her boss she decides to impress her boss. And so she forecloses. Well heres something they dont teach you in business school Never evict a witch. Because pretty soon Christines getting the full-bore 70s horror-movie treatment -- ghostly winds strange noises flying furniture gruesome nightmares and really pesky flies. And then finally a fortune-teller gives her the bad news Shes going to hell. No literally. In three days. Raimi likes monster movies too and he gives this film some generally spooky touches like the shadows of cloven hooves outside a door and a fluttering and oddly animated handkerchief. Buffs will notice a nod too to the classic ""Curse of the Demon"" (although Raimi doesnt repeat that films mistake by ever showing his fiend too clearly). What Raimi doesnt do either is take things too seriously -- something you may or may not appreciate depending on how seriously you take your own horror. For example the director goes to some trouble to give Christine -- played by Alison Lohman -- a complicated and sympathetic past. (Its essential if he doesnt want us cheering on the demon from the first scene.) But he also deflates even his scariest scenes with jokes. Personally I could have done with fewer gags. Fewer scenes of people gagging too (this is the kind of movie where people vomit blood flies worms embalming fluid and even eventually an entire cat -- usually right into another persons face). So no if youre looking for a modern classic -- something thats going to creepy-crawl under your skin like ""Pans Labyrinth"" or ""The Others"" or ""The Ring"" or ""The Sixth Sense"" -- sorry. This bit of ghoulish gory black comedy doesnt deliver on that level (mostly because it doesnt want to). But if youre not looking for a coolly creepy elegantly eerie classic -- if all you want are shocks and bumps and screams and laughs and a couple of they-did-NOT-just-show-that jawdroppers -- then ""Drag Me To Hell"" is definitely the funhouse ride for you.

(Universal Pictures) Joe Neumaier Thursday May 28 2009 325 PM Title Drag Me to Hell A woman fights to keep demons from taking her soul. With Alison Lohman Justin Long. Director Sam Raimi. (136) PG-13 Gore. At area theaters.Attention hordes of hacks making scary films as a way of joining the Hollywood food chain this is how its done. ""Drag Me to Hell"" is an eyeball-gouging lesson in how to make a genre flick and live to tell about it. Its not flawless but its vulnerabilities dont linger because director Sam Raimi truly believes in what hes doing -- whipping up a fun fat-free spookfest that feels like a maggot-filled meal even at 96 minutes. Christine (Alison Lohman) is a young mildly driven loan officer at a Los Angeles bank hoping for a promotion. To prove shes management material Christine goes against her gut and for the banks bottom line by turning down a weird old lady (Lorna Raver) trying to refinance her mortgage and save her home. Yet the glass-eyed gypsy woman -- who in the 1940s could have been played by famous scare-aracter actress Maria Ouspenskaya -- is the wrong coot to wrong.Thrown out by security she attacks Christine like a hellhound and lays a curse on her After three days of haunting Christines soul will become demon chow. No sooner is this explained by a storefront mystic (Dileep Rao) than the shadow beasts talking animals and creepy upchucks start. Christine hopes a seance will work. She clearly needs to see more seances. Theres an aerobicized kick to the script Raimi and his brother Ivan cooked up similar to the one they gave the overanalyzed ""Spider-Man 3."" (The first two Spidey entries are more definitively Sam Raimi movies and that whole blockbuster series would have been blander had he not been at the helm.) The gore comes up so fast that Justin Long as Christines boyfriend mostly pops up to look incredulous and her boss (David Paymer) to act hilariously jerky even when covered in blood. Lohman still as winning as in ""White Oleander"" and ""Matchstick Men"" fights the devils with every ounce of her tiny frame and Raimi and cinematographer Peter Deming give the movie the same snappy visual punch as Raimis crucial 80s B-movie ""Evil Dead 2."" As hes matured as a filmmaker Raimis dabbled in genre stuff less frequently but as in ""The Gift"" (2001) the flashlight-in-the-camping-tent glee he takes in pulp plots combines nicely with his grown-up storytelling skills. Here that actually results in a few ""Aww why didnt they show that?"" moments. Ultimately though theres enough wild chills in ""Drag Me to Hell"" to choke a goat. Even one possessed by an angry spirit. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

This gloriously imaginative tale of the devil foreclosing on a bank loan officers soul hits like a wallop to the solar plexus followed by a tickle to the funnybone. The characters are solid the shocks are grab-your-heart-medicine scary the story glides from twist to twist with diabolical grace. And its damned funny. Raimi gets us to relate to Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) from her sweet all-American name onward. In her very first scene shes commuting in an economy car speaking along with diction tapes to erase her Midwest accent. She walks past a bakery gazing at the pastries as if they were diamond bracelets. She has a midlevel bank job works hard plays fair follows the rules and has her eye on the assistant managers position. Its less personal ambition than a way to win the favor of her boyfriends upper-crust parents. Christine simply wants to be accepted. When a poor old gypsy woman appeals for a third extension on her mortgage the bank manager hands Christine the decision. She opts to foreclose -- an act made all the worse because she makes a conscious choice to switch off her compassion. The gypsy curses Christine. She will be tormented for three days by a demon then her soul will be pulled down to hell. The road to damnation is indeed paved with good intentions. When the movie is over youre not sure whether Christine deserved her fate or not. Raimi made his breakthrough with horror -- 1987s ""Evil Dead 2"" is a scary/zany masterpiece -- but today hes a mature skillful craftsman. He knows how to put us through the wringer with atmospheric chills and ambience. Raimi plays with our minds and expectations. His use of shadows scuttling along walls and window shades conjures exquisite tension One of the movies big jolts is the outline of cloven hooves seen beneath a door. Theres not much gore. Rather than painting the frame red Raimi makes his spooks spew phlegm maggots and formaldehyde. The novelty is shocking. While the demonic attacks on Christine are physically and psychically punishing theyre also sort of gonzo. Its as if the forces of darkness want Christine to experience a little campy Three Stooges slapstick along with the agony. The spirit of the movie comes through clearest in an exorcism scene when a possessed psychic levitates in midair and does a mocking devilish jig. The film takes a delicious detour into romantic comedy territory as Christine and boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) visit his parents for a dinner party at their mansion. Its difficult to make a good impression when youre under a gypsy curse. Christine is a tough adversary for the demons assaulting her and a scene in which she plays tomb raider in a rain-flooded grave raises our spirits. But Raimi that trickster has several more surprises up his sleeve leading to a jaw-dropping climax. Youll stumble out of the theater shivering and giggling simultaneously.

By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / May 29 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + In 1981 Sam Raimis ""The Evil Dead"" made a breakthrough for cheap-looking schlock. He found the comedy in dismemberment. The horror had a kind of slapstick kick simultaneously funny and frightening.Not only did the homemade quality lend the terrifying impression that on your next trip to the woods demons would descend but the movie looked like you could have made it yourself. Thats an illusion. A new generation of horror-comedy was born but Raimis inventive combination of precision and gnarly panic was hard to duplicate.Raimi made two sequels (among other straighter Hollywood movies) but would go on to become the more polished better-funded director behind the Spider-Man franchise. He gave those movies an amiable pop-whiz that honored adolescence instead of pandering to it. But lets face it the soaring professionalism of ""Spider-Man 2"" is a long way from the winking trash of ""Evil Dead II.""His jubilant new movie ""Drag Me to Hell"" splits the difference between blockbuster and schlock a horror movie that eventually finds that contagious comic high of Raimis no-budget youth but with grown-up money now.A young California bank loan officer named Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) eager for a promotion refuses a little old ladys request for an extension on her mortgage payment. The old lady (Lorna Raver) is a nasty crone. Actually shes something a little more problematic - a Slavic ""gypsy"" with a touch of evil. In any case she removes her dentures steals candy hocks up some radioactive-looking mucus begs on her knees for the extension and as shes being thrown out of the bank (yes shes that foul) installs a hell-bound curse that Christine spends the movie scrambling to remove.Christine leaves the bank happy that shes impressed her nasally boss (David Paymer) and upstaged her chief rival for the job (Reggie Lee). But the old lady is waiting in the back of Christines car to inflict more foulness. Their tussle is a nimble cartoon dance whose comedy is entirely physical and whose horror is entirely corporeal. The old ladys fanged dentures unwittingly fly out of her mouth so when she goes in to bite Christine she winds up gumming the girls chin.That sequence is the tip of a gross iceberg. And as expertly orchestrated as it is I wasnt convinced ""Drag Me to Hell"" was working by the time that parking lot fight ends. The principle problem is Lohman a 30-year-old blonde who sounds like a drunk baby. In order for the supernatural effects to impress and for the plot to take off Lohman is required to stand around and watch them happen to her. Raimi is a good filmmaker but he cant keep you from asking the age-old horror-thriller question Why dont these people ever run for their lives - or at least run faster?But eventually the movie lets its star in on the joke and Lohmans bright gurgling manner becomes a sharp gameness that makes Christines attempt to cleanse her soul a lot more fun. The turning point occurs with the words ""Heres kitty."" Youll have to see for yourself why but it brings down the house while dispelling any idea that the filmmakers arent fully in control.""Drag Me to Hell"" is a loose showcase of everything Raimi couldnt have tried in a Spider-Man movie - scatological gags talking goats a debate over Freud and Jung. (Christines unwaveringly supportive boyfriend played by Justin Long is a psychology professor.) Theres even a seance that requires Adriana Barraza the Oscar-nominated nanny from ""Babel"" to speak with the devils tongue. (The sound meanwhile has been designed to hasten hearing loss. Surely in some town using Digital Dolby Surround for the vomiting up of what can only be called maggot-fried rice is a crime.)But working with his brother Ivan Sam Raimi is laughing with us - and often louder than we are. (That glee is audible in the sound design too.) Previously the trouble with Raimi has sometimes been that you didnt trust him. Movies like ""Darkman"" and his Spaghetti-O western ""The Quick and the Dead"" were hard to take seriously. His laughter had turned into a smirk. ""Spider-Man"" restored a kind of joyful sincerity to his work. The latter stages of ""Drag Me to Hell"" demonstrate a particularly delightful commitment to the task at hand. Raimi succeeds at giving literal moviemaking a good name while providing diabolic catharsis for many a disgruntled homeowner.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Foreclosure is imminent.Sadly for perky banker Christine Brown (a game Alison Lohman) a powerful curse is imminent too. Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) the unpleasant hag getting her eviction papers may not have money to pay her bills but she knows how to deliver payback. Demons and dementia are in store for Ms. Brown.And a Raimi-esque mix of gross-out madness and sick laughs is in store as well. Drag Me to Hell which the Evil Dead horrormeister cowrote with his doctor brother Ivan Raimi is a tongue-in-cheek terrorfest in which one persons greed (and ambition) is rewarded with among other things a slice of cake with an eyeball in it a fly with a penchant for exploring facial cavities and a mud-wrestling match with the undead.Lohman taking the lead in her first horror flick has a Hitchcock-heroine placidity (and plasticity) about her. Christines mounting despair and disbelief as the consequences of the elderly Hungarians curse begin to manifest themselves are palpable. And whether you laugh or shudder when the vegetarian bank officer who volunteers at an animal shelter takes a kitchen knife and beckons her kitty it remains a moment to remember.Drag Me to Hell with Justin Long as Christines rich-kid boyfriend and David Paymer as her petty and unappealing boss takes the familiar stalked-through-the-parking-garage scenario to new realms with a claw-and-smash match between Christine and Mrs. Ganush. And a meet-the-parents dinner with the former farm-girl heroine facing her beaus patronizing mother and dad for the first time turns into a nightmare of faux pas and free-flowing body fluids.Raimi uses editing techniques that evoke Psycho and gore and ick effects remindful of George Romero and The Exorcist. (And of course vintage Raimi.) In his own American indie way the director brings to mind too the psychological horror of Roman Polanskis early and eerie Repulsion. (Raimis roots are certainly in indie even if his three Spidey titles are among the biggest grossers in Hollywood history.)Drag Me to Hell is in short a lot of fun even as it presents itself as a morality tale about avarice and moral hypocrisy. Theres some business with a collectible coin and a coat button that perhaps shouldnt have been telegraphed so noisily. And there are sloppy or just slow-to-get-going scenes. But with the same twisted humor Raimi displayed in Evil Dead and Army of Darkness his Drag Me to Hell is wickedly jolly and disturbingly frightening - often at the same time.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Sam Raimis Drag Me To Hell opens with the 80s Universal Studios logo only the first indication that Raimi whos been shackled to the Spider-Man franchise for the last decade intends to go back in time. Specifically hes recalling his own time at Universal in the early 90s when he brought the splatstick hokum of his Evil Dead days to the studio playground with 1990s Darkman and 1992s Army Of Darkness. A sort of de facto Evil Dead 4 Drag Me To Hell picks up where he left off trafficking in lots of supernatural mumbo-jumbo (gypsy curses psychics ass-whomping ghosts) as an excuse for gloriously over-the-top horror-comedy. Just as Spider-Man 3 seemed to buckle under the weight of increasingly unwieldy endeavor Raimis new film feels distinctly unburdened and fun happily frolicking in its own pulp silliness. Playing a farm-girl wallflower with surprising moxie Alison Lohman stars as a sweet-natured loan officer competing for an assistant-manager position. Her boss (David Paymer) warns her that the job requires making the tough decisions but Lohman chooses to demonstrate her toughness on the wrong customer denying a spooky old woman (Lorna Raver) an extension on her home loan. The spiteful women unleashes an ancient curse on Lohman that involves three days of torment--Evil Dead-style spirit-beatings basically--followed by a creature that drags her... well... its right there in the title. Starting with a hilariously protracted confrontation between Lohman and the old woman in the parking deck--it may be the first time anyone has been in danger of being gummed to death--Drag Me To Hell piles on the cartoon horror setpieces in rapid succession. That PG-13 rating may sound like a liability for a director who once hosed Bruce Campbell with torrents of blood shooting out of the walls but Raimi makes a sly asset of this limitation. Just like other PG-13-rated horror movies the film relies on shock effects instead of blood but Raimi pushes those effects to a full-on visceral assault. He wants viewers to jump out of their chairs to laugh and scream and cheer and to nudge each other over the transcendent ridiculousness of what theyre witnessing. This is junk filmmaking at its finest. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Up Next Movie Review Up Dont miss a story--follow The A.V. Club on Cant see comments?

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 28 2009 155PM EDT Last updated Tuesday Jun. 02 2009 827AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Drag Me to Hell Directed by Sam Raimi Written by Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi Starring Alison Lohman and Justin Long Classification 14A Long before he directed the Spider-Man trilogy Sam Raimi won the enduring devotion of cult fans for his slapstick horror trilogy - Evil Dead (1981) Evil Dead II (1987) and Army of Darkness (1992). Drag Me to Hell is a return to those horror roots an unabashedly schlocky expertly executed blend of jack-in-the-box jolts and humour. More polished but similar in its over-the-top spirit to the Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez Grindhouse diptych Raimis homage to his auteur beginnings has at least as many laughs as scares and generous helpings of yucky seepage in between. With a PG-13 rating in the United States the movie stays well clear of contemporary horror-movie levels of lurid violence. After a brief prelude set in 1969 in which were introduced to the hell-dragging demon we speed forward to the present. Pert wide-eyed loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) arrives at her office. Shes a formerly pudgy farm girl whos eager to remake herself as a sleek young urban professional. When she tries to persuade her manager (David Paymer) that shes assistant-manager material she finds herself in competition with a new office suck-up (Reggie Lee). Anxious to demonstrate that shes capable of making ""the hard decisions"" she refuses a loan to an old woman Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) allowing the bank to foreclose on her home. Mrs. Ganush who has a mottled blind eye jagged brown false teeth and an accent that would make Boris Karloff shiver is not the sort of crone you want to cross. An initial confrontation descends into a pitched battle in an underground parking lot involving abuses of office staplers and denture-less gumming. Temporarily defeated Mrs. Ganush tears a button from Christines coat and croaks out a gypsy curse against the unfortunate loan officers stingy soul. In the following hours its not clear which terrors are in Christines head and which are real. Apparitions attack vomit and then disappear. Before Christine can beg forgiveness from Mrs. Ganush the vengeful old woman dies. Christine is left to rely on her fiance Clay (Justin Long) a smug young college professor and a store-front psychic (Dileep Rao) for help. Most of the script (which was co-written by Raimi and his brother Ivan) consists of Christine being stalked by a mythical demon as she tries to avoid going the way of the movies title. Shadow fingers reach under doors invisible forces hurl her against walls and generally the movie becomes a series of loud shocks and looming monstrous shapes culminating in an absurd carnival-like seance. Apart from Ravers zestfully grotesque gypsy granny Drag Me to Hell moves too quickly for any conspicuous displays of acting although Lohmans transformation from victim to avenger brings some tingles of delight. As she has proved in such movies as Atom Egoyans Where the Truth Lies and Ridley Scotts Matchstick Men  Lohman has a knack for playing characters who arent as innocent as they appear. Raimi works some sly visual comedy around Lohmans petite body and incongruously pillowy cheeks to suggest a woman whos ready to puff up and explode. At the same time he plays a fairly sophisticated shell game with the audiences sympathies and our complicity with Christines dark side. Though its message of ill-will toward bankers is timely the values in Drag Me to Hell are retro - its a morality tale about social ambitions. Theres a fine comic scene when Christine meets Clays ultra-rich supercilious parents and she almost wins them over before her grotesque hallucinations spoil dessert. Hosing the office staff with a projectile nose-bleed also raises doubts about Christines management skills. And how exactly is a fashionable vegetarian supposed to handle the need for a ritual animal sacrifice? In the Spider-Man movies Raimi showed a superhero weighed down by his privileges and social duties. In Drag Me to Hell  even a modest ambition for the assistant-managers office entails great responsibility and the risk of eternal peril.

ABOUT THE MOVIEDrag Me to Hell    Stars Alison Lohman Justin Long Lorna Raver David Paymer Adriana Barraza Director Sam RaimiDistributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for sequences of horror violence terror disturbing images and language. Running time 1 hour 39 minutes.Opens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The best horror movies like the best amusement park rides should elicit equal parts screams and laughter. Drag Me to Hell fits that squirmy bill and then some. Sam Raimi (the Spider-Man movies) has fashioned a slick old-school scarefest that combines the best of schlocky fright flicks with classic supernatural thrillers. Raimi returns triumphant to the genre where he cut his teeth so to speak with 1981s The Evil Dead. (Speaking of things dental there are some outrageous moments involving a toothless old lady and her menacing dentures.) MORE Sam Raimi returns to his roots The movie centers on a contest between this geriatric meanie (Lorna Raver) and Christine (Alison Lohman) a damsel in distress who fights back. A bank officer angling for a promotion Christine rejects an extension on the old ladys defaulted home loan. How timely that the mayhem is kicked off by someone facing foreclosure. The elderly woman whose vaguely Slavic accent conjures up images of gypsies does more than give Christine the evil eye though eyeballs do figure prominently. Evoking the black comedy of his early horror films Raimi has fashioned a cathartic thrill ride that seems almost innocent by current horror standards. He relies on shadows and ominous sounds to make the audience jump and recoil rather than grisly violence blood splattering or bone-crunching special effects. Drag Me to Hell is horror light. Jokey and playful its far from the torture porn of such fright flicks as the Saw and Hostel series. Instead of gruesome weaponry or mass slaughter there are insects and a ghostly seance. For witty one-liners theres Justin Long as Clay Christines devoted boyfriend. Most of the roles are caricatures but intentionally so. Drag Me to Hell is unlike any scary thriller in a while frightening frenzied and fun. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

"Drag Me to Hell | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; drag-me-to-hell ) Drag Me to Hell (United States 2009) May 27 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Oh no not another PG-13 horror film ""But wait"" you say. ""Its by Sam Raimi."" Perhaps then it shouldnt be routinely dismissed as just another tale of demons and ghosts that has been emasculated with the goal of appealing to pimple-faced teenagers who havent figured out how to sneak into legitimate R-rated features. Raimi despite having become sidetracked by a certain web-slinging superhero in recent years has legitimate horror credentials. Not only is his Evil Dead trilogy considered a horror milestone but hes the only director to have gotten Katie Holmes to doff her top. That alone has to count for something although had The Gift been rated PG-13 Katies assets would have remained concealed. So has Raimi achieved the Holy Grail? Has he made a horror film that chills and thrills yet is mild enough to allow admittance to comers of all ages? Sadly no. But wait... all is not lost. Although Drag Me to Hell mostly fails as horror it achieves sporadic success as a comedy. The conundrum lies in locating the line of demarcation between intentional and unintentional humor. With Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness Raimi demonstrated that he enjoys spiking his blood and gore with satire wit and the Three Stooges. Some of that is in evidence here. Unfortunately there are also times when the direction and acting are so ham-fisted that intended scares provoke chortles instead of gasps. Even if one shifts mindset and looks at Drag Me to Hell as pure satire its effectiveness is middling. It feels bloated and overlong and the occasional bursts of laughter dont warrant a 100-minute investment of time. Loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is vying with a co-worker for the vacant position of assistant manager. She needs the promotion not only to secure her future but to impress the parents of her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) who think shes not good enough for their son. The bank manager Mr. Jacks (David Paymer) delights in playing Christine against her rival and watching the sparks fly. One day a crone with the improbable name of Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes to the bank asking for relief from a mortgage she cant pay. Shes behind on her payments and is about to lose her house. Mr. Jacks leaves the resolution of the matter to Christine and she decides to take the hard-line to demonstrate her toughness. Mrs. Ganush does not react well to this. A verbal confrontation leads to a physical alteration which culminates in the old woman leveling a curse at Christines jacket button. Soon thereafter Christine begins having disturbing visitations by things that go bump in the night and she solicits the aid of a mystic (Dileep Rao) to rid her of the curse and its associated devil who after three days of haunting her will claim her soul and drag her bodily to hell. Before that she has a conversation with a talking goat and a life-and-death struggle with a psychotic handkerchief. If one wants to analyze the storyline its not hard to distinguish allegorical intentions. With Christine representing bankers and Mrs. Ganush standing in for the undertrodden whose circumstances are ignored by greedy capitalists Drag Me to Hell could be seen as a morality play - Raimis commentary on the current economic climate. Its tough to take much in this movie seriously however since it is constructed in a way that defies thoughtful interpretation. Christine isnt the usual sympathetic victim. Shes narcissistic cruel and unstable. Shes the kind of character you end up rooting against recognizing that she probably deserves whats coming to her especially after what she does to a kitten. (Filmmakers dont have a problem doing ugly things to cats in movies; imagine if this had been a puppy.) In fact after that incident the guy sitting next to me muttered that he hoped she would die. Im not sure thats the reaction Raimi was hoping for. Drag Me to Hell doesnt have the correct perspective if audiences are supposed to be rooting for the demon. The screenplay features a clumsily handled last-act twist that should cause acute embarrassment to viewers who dont see it coming. Its as obvious a story contortion as I have ever seen and its recognition transforms the final 20 minutes into an exercise in pointlessness. In fact this plot element is so abysmal that I expected Raimi to have something else up his sleeve (such as the twist being a blind) - but his arms are bare. Disappointing doesnt begin to describe it. Im trying to figure out what happened to Alison Lohmans acting ability. She was good in White Oleander and Matchstick Men but was wooden and unconvincing a few years later in Where the Truth Lies. Here shes less impressive than in the Atom Egoyan melodrama (where at least she took her clothing off)  evidencing an over-the-top awkwardness. By conventional standards its a poor performance but one has to consider whether thats what Raimi wanted. After all Bruce Campbells Evil Dead work was anything but subtle and nuanced. Lohman however is not Campbell who has made overacting into an art form. Justin Long playing the supportive boyfriend is okay but was it really necessary to surround his character with Macs? (It would have been funny to have shown Clay using a P.C. but Longs contract probably forbids that.) I wont argue that Drag Me to Hell is entirely without merit. Parts of it are entertaining although Im not convinced theyre enjoyable entirely for the reasons intended by the filmmakers. My sense is that Evil Dead II is Raimis target but the elements dont all fall into place and Lohman cant fill Campbells shoes. There are echoes of the ""old Raimi"" - enough to confuse mainstream PG-13 horror fans but not enough to please his adherents. For those who want to sample Drag Me to Hells brand of cheesiness the best approach is to bypass its theatrical release and wait a little while until the DVD shows up in the discount bins at your local S-Mart.

Daily Edition Login to download Drag Me to Hell -- Film Review 950 AM PDT 5/20/2009 by Michael Rechtshaffen  AP FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS TWITTER Having been preoccupied with a little thing called the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy Sam Raimi returns to his ""Evil Dead"" roots with ""Drag Me to Hell"" a funhouse ride of a supernatural thriller surrounding a demonic gypsy curse.He might be armed with a larger budget than what he had to work with back in the pre-Spidey days but Raimis still very much up to his old tricks retaining that deliriously over-the-top brand of Grand Guignol horror that he had abandoned by the mid-90s in pursuit of other genres.Raimis legions of early fans wholl likely be tickled by the title alone are certain to eat this stuff up especially given the buzz thats been building since a sneak preview of an unfinished version at the South by Southwest Festival in March.The completed version meanwhile will have a Wednesday midnight screening at Cannes ahead of its May 29 opening.Life for Christine (Alison Lohman) would seem reasonably far from hell given her position as a Los Angeles bank loan officer and her nurturing relationship with her college professor boyfriend (Justin Long).But all that changes when forced to choose between granting yet another home loan extension to weird old Mrs. Ganush (fearless stage actress Lorna Raver) or impressing her boss (David Paymer) she opts for career maintenance.Facing eviction the elderly Hungarian woman damns Christines soul with the curse of the Lamia a mythical beast wholl pay a visit to haul her off to you-know-where.Hatched by Raimi and his brother Ivan the scripting is not without some clunky plot mechanics but its hard to notice given all that visceral visual goop heaved onto the screen with gleeful abandon.Incorporating old-school puppetry and prosthetic makeup combined with some judiciously used CGI along with a colorful cast and composer Christopher Youngs unnerving symphonic blasts Raimis raucous trip to hell proves to be anything but a drag.

Raimi like Roman Polanski in his classic Repulsion (1965) surrounds a comely blond lass (Alison Lohman) with demons that seem to be erupting right out of her head. He gets into our heads too; he scares the unholy living bejesus out of you. Raimis operating model is the fun house with its jack-in-the-box terrors but he doesnt just toy with the audience. He plays it like a maestro. He orchestrates a tongue-in-cheek symphony of fear. Lohman with her slightly dazed rabbit-toothed sensuality plays a bank worker who refuses to renew the mortgage of a one-eyed rotten-toothed old gypsy woman (Lorna Raver). Lohman then spends the rest of the film fighting off the curse the gypsy has placed on her. Shes assaulted by flash-cut visions of baroquely grotesque and evil things starting with the gypsy herself a hideous crone ?who has a way of taking out her false teeth and well doing stuff without them. Their first encounter in a parking garage is like ?a slasher showdown crossed with a wrestling blowout; it unites the audience in a collective moan-laugh-shriek. The bedroom nightmare that follows is so gross it redefines the phrase in your face and from then on were clamped into a state of tingly anticipatory anxiety. Raimi directed all three Spider-Man films but in the 80s before he went Hollywood he made The Evil Dead and its sequel -- splendid exercises in slapstick mutilation and whooshing-camera dread. Drag Me to Hell marks a return to their spirit -- even if its only PG-13 -- but its also a deftly unified freak show that keeps intensifying as its wormy-devil images keep spewing. Going back to his roots Raimi has made the most crazy fun and terrifying horror movie in years.

Drag Me to Hell Director Sam Raimi. Cast Alison Lohman Justin Long Lorna Raver. Rating Rated PG-13 for sequences of horror violence terror disturbing images and language. Great Good Fair Bad Bomb Related Horror beckons Sam Raimi home Creepy movies Movie curses Its been 17 years since you directed ""Army of Darkness"" and 22 since the iconic ""Evil Dead 2"" one of the hallmarks of camp horror. We understand you were busy. The lure of the ""Spider-Man"" films was strong and the first couple were good. But if there was any doubt scary movies are where you really belong ""Drag Me to Hell"" dispels it. All is forgiven. ""Hell"" is as scary as it is funny and its often hilarious in a hand-over-the-eyes kind of way. Theres no post-modern message here no metaphor for the human condition. Going gloriously over the top Raimi simply aims to make us laugh and scare the pants off us and he hits the mark on both fronts. Simply put its an outlandish amount of fun. Simple is about the only way to put it really; that certainly describes the plot and the character development what there is of either. In an opening set piece a boy who stole from a gypsy woman incurs a curse; he and his soul are snatched to hell - literally. Cut to the present where sweet loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is trying to impress her boss (David Paymer) to outgun newcomer and kiss-up Stu (Reggie Lee) for the assistant manager job. To prove her toughness she denies a third mortgage extension to Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) a hideous old crone. After one of the most bizarre fight scenes youll ever see - a stapler plays a key role - Mrs. Ganush puts a curse on her. The next thing you know an evil goat-type spirit is menacing Christine and a psychic Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) tells her that unless she can make things right with the spirit itll take her to hell in three days. What follows is a steady stream of starts scares and gross-outs all handled expertly - Raimi has a particular gift if you can call it that for vomit. Christine a former farm girl enjoys the love of a good man Clay (Justin Long) whose mother (Molly Cheek) doesnt think shes good enough for her darling son. A psychology professor Clay is naturally skeptical but he truly cares about Christine and goes along for the ride. Rham wants to help as well but hes outgunned so he brings in a higher-level medium (Adriana Barraza) who has telling experience with this kind of thing. With the exception of Rao who is particularly good and Lee the acting is flat - and fitting. No ones going to confuse Lohman with Meryl Streep for instance but her performance is straight out of the 50s B-movies Raimi so clearly loves. That love as well as his considerable skill pays off. ""Hell"" manages to be an homage a send-up and an original work of schlock horror all at the same time. Ridiculous? Oh yeah - if ridiculously entertaining is what you mean.

"Drag me to Hell movie review drag me to hell sam raimi - Orlando Sentinel Get the latest tips for staying healthy and happy as you age Features Features Movie review Drag Me to Hell -- 4 out of 5 stars Roger MooreSentinel Staff Writer Sam Raimi leaves Spider-Manliness behind and digs up his horror roots in Drag Me to Hell a terror tale almost as fun as its tease of a title. Raimi who got his start with the Evil Dead movies sure-handedly blends thrills with giggles in this old-fashioned newfangled over-the-top hair-raiser.Pretty young bank loan officer Christine (Alison Lohman) is the woman everybody walks over. Shes being out-maneuvered for the big promotion. Her beaus mom insults her as ""the farm girl."" An unpleasant old woman customer (Lorna Raver) thinks nothing of popping out her slimy false teeth to empty Christines desktop candy jar and figures she can sob-story another extension on her mortgage. Christines compassion even for the grotesque Mrs. Ganush doesnt impress her sexist boss (David Paymer). Can she make ""the hard decision?"" Yes and that is her undoing.Ganush is a Gypsy or a movie caricature of a Gypsies -- violent and vengeful. In a relentless assault on the banker (How timely is that?) the old crone puts a curse on the pretty young thing. Christines terror only grows at the explanations of her plight by a fortune teller (Dileep Rao). Her disbelieving psychology professor boyfriend (Justin Long) is little help. Something is coming for Christine something awful. Raimi makes Drag Me to Hell an exercise in old school horror. He finds his frights in the four Fs -- flies fingers (bony shadows claw at stained-glass windows) fiddles (Gypsy music precedes each scare) and forks.Forks? When youve made a cake for the boyfriends parents see the evil eye in the slice youve cut for yourself stab it and watch the fork wriggle thats scary-funny stuff.Lohman makes the trip from wallflower to victim to victim-who-fights-back work and Raver as the witch who brings the wrath of Hades upon her is horrific. Long is pretty bland and onetime Oscar nominee Adriana Barraza has too little presence as the medium who might be Christines salvation.Raimi is pulling one over on us for much of the movie. But he hurls moral dilemmas at Christine lets us rationalize what shell do and happily pulls the rug out from under us. And were happy to have him do it. As we learned way back in his Evil Dead youth Raimis brand of hellishly silly horror is anything but a drag.

By Rex Reed  05/26/09 1001pm Drag Me To HellRunning time 99 minutesWritten by Sam and Ivan RaimiDirected by Sam Raimi Starring Alison Lohman Justin Long David Paymer Lorna Raver The true test of any successful horror flick is how wretched it makes you feel. At the very least it should inspire a banquet of dread or offer a canape of anxiety. After Drag Me to Hell you wont mind walking home alone. You might even welcome a dark deserted alley. It could help alleviate the anger of knowing youve been had. This is surprising since Drag Me to Hell is the creation of writer-director Sam Raimi whose body of work has been dedicated to turning more than one viewers hair white with the Evil Dead and Spider-Man franchises. The only thing hes likely to turn a viewer to this time is the door marked exit. For God only knows what reason it begins with a prelude staged in 1969 in Pasadena. A kid steals a necklace from a gypsy wagon and takes refuge in one of those old houses that look like W. C. Fields lived there. The doors slam open; people fall to their deaths; the floor opens and sucks the little thief into a cauldron of flames; and the house goes back to looking like a silent-film set. Forty years later a pretty loan officer in a California bank named Christine Brown (Alison Lohman sometimes unfairly confused with Lindsay Lohan) refuses to extend a delinquent loan to an ancient hag with one eye and a mouth full of black incisors who has an epileptic fit in the middle of the bank and puts a curse on the young career girl. The nightmare begins. The crone attacks her in the underground parking garage wrecks her car and rips a button from her coat. Soon she hears the same voices the little boy heard back in 1969. A bug crawls into her nose in the middle of the night. The next day at work she spews blood all over the bank. Her boyfriend (Justin Long) pooh-poohs the whole thing until she bakes a harvest cake to impress his snobby parents and a human eye pops out of the batter with the kind of ensuing dinner-table chaos that guarantees a short engagement with no need for the bridal registry at Bloomingdales. Seeking the help of a loopy carnival medium Christine finds herself up to her pierced ears in corpse vomit animal sacrifice violent seances and open graves. Nothing stops the curse. The road to deliverance leads to the same old house in Pasadena containing the doorway to hell but the movie doesnt end there. Theres still a preposterous finale in a grotesque cemetery that tickles the funny bone more than it assaults the nervous system. Sound effects play an important part in the superficial mechanics (pots and pans rattle glass shatters powerful forces knock people to the floor) and to Mr. Raimis credit there is no happy ending. Still the first rule in spook films is ""If you want to hold the audiences attention make them believe the horror could really happen""--a rule Drag Me to Hell ignores at its own peril. Nobody in the movie knows anything about gypsy witchcraft.

Often a drifting virtuoso in the years before finding his Spider-Man gig with Drag Me to Hell Raimi defaults to the horror romps that made his name (specifically the Evil Dead trilogy) bringing the old barreling camera and viscous ickiness back and serving a concept lowbrow enough to discourage A-listers.Made early last year from a long-shelved script by Raimi and brother Ivan Drag Me has a serendipitously timely victim. Playing a bank loan officer petite marshmallow-cheeked Alison Lohman bears the brunt of the films supernatural humiliations. Lohmans Christine Brown is putting the finishing touches on her self-reinvention as a young professional eye on a promotion renting L.A. hillside real estate and heading toward marriage with an upmarket boyfriend Clay (that hes played by that icon of yuppie brand identity smug MacBook shill Justin Long is perfect). Only leftover photographs and snide comments from Clays WASP parents give unwelcome reminders of the tubby farm girl she used to be.One day smothering her conscience to impress her boss Christine refuses to take pity on an ancient gypsy woman about to lose her home (Lorna Raver with a malevolent dead eye horking up neon phlegm). The Louvin Brothers were right Satan is Real. The hag hisses a hex and Christines life plan is derailed by a chain of diabolical interventions that play like Seventeen magazines ""Embarrassing Moments"" as written by Antonin Artaud. Christine spouts a geyser nosebleed at work is ambushed by hallucinations while meeting her potential in-laws and starts studying animal sacrifice. A visit to a psychic confirms shes had a demon sicced on her and if it isnt appeased in time shell get the title treatment.With a PG-13 rating the movie still smuggles a good amount of awfulness into adolescent minds. The running joke involves getting Christine into situations where her mouth--usually wide open screaming--is invaded by incredibly vile things a spelunking fly a gush of grubs embalming fluid. Otherwise the harassing spirit comes on Moe Howard-style--one-two snapping her head back and forth or unloading a full-body across-the-room heave. If the booga-booga shocks are sometimes repetitive Drag Me does its audience right in its last-act burst of giddy momentum sustained by crack editor Bob Murawski through a burlesque exorcism Christines dash to find a substitute for her place in Hell and the final slamming door of the title card.The combination of Lovecraftian ichor and Hal Roach slapstick made Michigan State dropout Raimi a Fangoria star with 1981s resourceful Evil Dead on the vanguard of an international groundswell of indie horrors. Kiwi-era Peter Jackson Return of the Living Dead Re-Animator Frank Henenlotter Nekromantik--these grassroots sickies marked by tumor-black humor and try-anything camerawork were an inventive sanguinary alternative to the flat-out-awful middle range of 80s movies (and in some cases resumes for a next generation of blockbuster technicians).Was this throwback Raimis way of collecting himself after disappearing into Spider-Man 3s narrative overgrowth? The sense of control is palpable; Raimi ever the engineer takes pleasure in screwing with audience identification shifting between collaboration and contempt for our heroine. We take Christines side against a brown-nose co-worker (Reggie Lee very good) Clays pinky-in-air parents and that gypsy witch-bitch whose lingered-on grotesqueness forestalls sympathy--but its squeaky-cute Christine who is all along the secret villain.On the surface an Evil Dead successor Drag Me an allegory with karmic logic from E.C. Comics and Jack Chick replays as farce Raimis A Simple Plan also based on the boomerang return of transgression. Christine getting bonged on the head with a cross for forgetting the Golden Rule doesnt indicate a particularly nuanced moral vision. Does Raimi--who began his career on a shoestring in the Tennessee woods and now commands 300 million bonanzas--actually believe professional ambition should be punished with eternal damnation?

Sam Raimi returns to his roots in ""Drag Me to Hell"" a flagrantly schlocky horror yarn that will titillate the teens without alienating the directors far pickier fanboy contingent who will find the ""Evil Dead""-style action theyve been clamoring for in a surprisingly potent PG-13 package. When the bank forecloses on an old gypsys house its the unlucky young loan officer who risks having her soul repossessed in this throwback to both Raimis early work and 50s B-movies. After booking the pic in coveted midnight slots at the SXSW and Cannes fests Universal should see strong awareness yield heavenly returns. As its no-nonsense title suggests ""Drag Me to Hell"" offers a kicking-and-screaming riff on the classic curse movie -- and if the material scarcely warrants feature length so be it. Scant of plot and barren of subtext the pic is single-mindedly devoted to pushing the audiences buttons and who better than Raimi to do the honors? Long before he went legit with ""A Simple Plan"" helmer was perfecting inventive shocks on shoestring budgets and as if to remind us of that legacy he opens this modestly budgeted film (by ""Spider-Man"" standards at least) with an early-80s Universal logo. First scene further cements the tone as an innocent boy (though not so innocent as to avoid being cursed) attempts to outrun his imminent damnation only to be thrown from a balcony and swallowed whole by a gaping fiery chasm in the earth. Its hard to imagine such a fate awaiting Christine (Alison Lohman) a sweet young lady gunning for the assistant manager job at her local bank until we see the almost comically unkempt old hag who comes begging for an extension on her mortgage. With one bad eye gnarled fingernails and inexplicably jagged dentures Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) is clearly the reason Raimi and his brother Ivan decided to write this in the first place. Shes as memorable a villain as Christine is forgettable a heroine and the fact that Mrs. Ganush means bad business is so evident in her introductory scene that the mere appearance of her car (played by Raimis own instantly recognizable 1973 Oldsmobile) in the parking garage is enough to make neck hairs stand on end. On the losing end of a showdown that makes creative use of a stapler and several other everyday office supplies Mrs. Ganush manages to grab one of Christines buttons and utter a nasty incantation. ""Soon it will be you who comes begging to me"" she predicts. But the crusty old crone expires before Christine can ask her to lift the curse leaving our hell-bent heroine with no one but her skeptical fiance (Justin Long) and an in-over-his-head street-corner psychic (Dileep Rao) to advise her on how to escape her fate. In the increasingly desperate events that follow Raimi clearly believes the mouth not the eyes are the window to the soul with one grossout gag after another exploiting auds fear of foreign substances (from ominous flies to Mrs. Ganushs phlegm) entering the mouth. Such off-putting visuals are considerably more effective than Raimis next favorite trick which is to ratchet up the already overloud soundtrack alongside a shock cut. The scares are all delivered in Raimis usual tongue-in-cheek style down to the menacing goat-like ""Lamia"" (seen only in cartoonish silhouette its shape is a direct homage to Jacques Tourneurs 1957 ""Night of the Demon""). Its odd to find so many laugh-out-loud moments amid such genuine tension but were it not for Raimis comic touch auds would likely be outraged by a good deal of the material -- the fate of Christines kitten for instance or the movies unapologetically backward characterization of gypsies. Pic seems to have lucked into what little relevance the mortgage crisis lends its story otherwise so slight as to seem better suited to an hourlong ""Masters of Horror"" episode. Still theres no denying it delivers far more than competing PG-13 thrillers (including several from Raimis own Ghost House shingle). CG touches -- including the one thatll have auds cheering into the end credits -- look cheap but practical effects and makeup are tops.
