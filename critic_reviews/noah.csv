The movies that a director has been toting in his back pocket for decades waiting for the moment to be ripe and the opportunity to present itself have ""white elephant"" written all over them. That was my fear when after the greatly deserved success of ""Black Swan"" from 2010 Darren Aronofsky announced his plan to make a grand-scale big-budget version of the story of Noah which had been an obsession of his since he was thirteen (hes now forty-five). But the adolescent spark behind ""Noah"" (which Tad Friend discusses in his Profile of Aronofsky in the magazine) far from being an obstacle or a pitfall is central to its virtues. The movie grows from a sense of wonder inspired by the contemplation of Biblical grandeur the recognition that there was a world in which divine and human things seemed to be integrated. Giants walked the earth and humans were often endowed with impossible powers. God intervened in daily affairs with an alacrity and an efficacy that mayors would envy and he spoke to people loud and clear from his verified account. The story of Noah is first of all a near-apocalypse in which God kills off almost everybody and the terrifying scale of divine wrath along with the awesome burden of the few remaining people who confront it must have had a shattering effect on the young Aronofsky. That vision of enormity--of divinity as monstrosity--comes through in the movie. And what about the holy man who is totally devoted to that God and who actually hears the command of that God? The power of ""Noah"" arises from Aronofskys shuddering comprehension that the person who thinks hes in touch with God is capable of anything. The movie stands on its head the Dostoyevskian dictum ""If God does not exist everything is permitted."" In ""Noah"" the notion of Gods existence renders the natural order frenetically jinglingly miraculously disorderly and it grants a true believer a free pass for whatever atrocity he believes hes commanded to enact. Remarkably in the movies crucial drama--Noahs intention to end the human race by killing the offspring of his son Shem (Douglas Booth) and his daughter-in-law Ila (Emma Watson)--Aronofsky grafts onto the tale of Noah one of the most harrowing and morally troubling Biblical stories Abrahams readiness to sacrifice his son Isaac. It seems as if that tale in particular had been troubling Aronofsky since childhood too. What has been widely cited as the ""environmentalist"" orientation of Aronofskys version of the Noah story (which he co-wrote with his longtime friend Ari Handel) is more like a Christianized nightmare of an Old Testament enormity come to life. The movie pivots on the notion of original sin not a Jewish idea but rather a Christian one which in Aronofskys imagination is established back to the primordial days of Yahwistic world-making. If the fathers of the Hebrew Bible imagined the Fall as a blight on the species at large and as a curse on human nature but had only the wrathful God of the Hebrew Bible to listen to how could they justify their own existence and exertions? What right did Noah have to perpetuate his own line and his own species in the face of his own recognition of unworthiness? Im reminded of another Jewish kid who leveraged an outsiders knowledge of Christian lore into a radical twist on tradition the thirteen-year-old Ozzie from the twenty-three-year-old Philip Roths story ""The Conversion of the Jews."" (Its in the book ""Goodbye Columbus."") For those who havent read it its too delicious to give away. But over-all Roths young epikores airs an intellectually skeptical and gleefully ribald objection to a defining Jewish tenet in order to show up the dullness blandness and incuriosity of the elders. The child--and the author--offer a vast guffaw of reason against the harshness of authority and the illegitimate demands of orthodoxy. Roth offers his own tweak--a riotous one--on Abrahams sacrifice of Isaac. It reminds me that after a Rosh Hashanah service where the rabbis sermon addressed that story my pious but non-observant mother said ""If God told me to sacrifice my son Id have said No Are you crazy? "" She was a good mother but not from the ancient perspective a good Jew--a notion thats packed into Roths story. (The writer David Grossman in George Packers 2010 Profile of him in the magazine makes a similar observation.) Roths concluding flourish evokes a liberal humanism that both arises from modern American Judaism and blurs its tenets. Similarly the dramatic climax of ""Noah"" in which family love and moral instincts justify the ways of man to God suggests the first draft of a New Testament--albeit one that Jews could live with too. Aronofsky however is no sentimentalist. His vision of a humane religion is one thats achieved through the trials of a fierce hardened rigid man who has to wrestle with the vengeful and unyielding God within himself. Although the ostensible ecological passion that runs through the film may appeal to the left side of the political spectrum Aronofskys depiction of a righteous believer who takes the first step in setting aside judgment in favor of tolerance is a lesson pointedly aimed at the conservative faithful--the audience for whom a Bible movie would be ticket-bait in the first place. Aronofskys images including his mercurial special effects as well as the glowering red-hot performance by Russell Crowe do justice to this distinctive vision of struggle with iron-willed faith. But the movies visionary eccentricity is undercut tamed normalized by one unfortunate element the bewilderingly bombastic music which seems to be the directors concession to the norms of a studio action film. Had Aronofsky followed Stanley Kubricks lead from ""2001"" and repudiated a score in favor of music to match the inner grandeur of his conception (which to me evokes Mahler and Schoenberg) hed have emphasized the idiosyncratic power of his own big idea. Though had he done so he might also have had more trouble getting the movie to attract the wide national audience for which its intended.

Comments (16) click to enlarge Noah Recommended Video Rated PG-13  137 minutes  2014 For all the high-tech showmanship on display this retelling of Noah and the Ark marks a serious effort to engage with the Old Testament as a literary text. Director Darren Aronofsky (Requiem for a Dream) makes little attempt to ameliorate its depiction of humanity as inherently barbaric or to render God as compassionate; the Creator here is punishing inscrutable and despotic. The films austere worldview is conveyed through dark cinematography and some of the most forbidding landscapes Ive seen in a biblical movie outside of Jean-Marie Straub and Daniele Huillets Moses and Aaron (much of this was shot on the crags of Iceland). The battle sequences and CG creatures are rather silly recalling Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings movies but the films fundamental grimness packs a punch.

"Noah - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Noah Posted by Christy Lemire on March 29 2014 24 Comments Paramount Pictures Rated PG-13 for violence disturbing images and brief suggestive content. Running time 139 minutes Two and a half stars out of four. ""Noah"" Darren Aronofskys take on the biblical tale of Noahs Ark is a fascinating and frustrating amalgamation of a couple different cinematic impulses that wouldnt necessarily seem to go together. Aesthetically its straight-up art-house beautiful and strange dark and often nightmarish. Working with his usual cinematographer the great Matthew Libatique Aronofsky offers us an ancient land filled with both endless colorful skies and rugged unforgiving terrian. The technical effects are spectacular -- this is a rare blockbuster for Aronofsky even as it visually recalls the magical realism of his ambitious meandering ""The Fountain"" from 2007. If youre going to see it make sure you do so on the largest screen possible. But ""Noah"" is also the rare big-budget studio movie with a pure faith-affirming message. As the title character Russell Crowe makes some seriously questionable decisions -- ones that could be considered selfish and cruel and cost countless lives -- and his determination to carry out what he believes is his mission from God leads him to the brink of committing some horrific acts. But you know what? He was right. Despite the protests of doubters all around him -- namely his family -- his vision was clear his faith rewarded. We know where we stand here when the embodiment of pure evil -- Ray Winstones character the marauding weapon maker Tubal-Cain -- tells one of Noahs sons ""A man is not ruled by the heavens. A man is ruled by free will."" Its a rather canny decision to release a mainstream film full of Oscar winners which surely will appeal to Christian audiences who are both eager and underserved by a few paltry indie offerings. In some ways ""Noah"" resembles one of those Kirk Cameron movies about the apocalypse only with a better cast and more dazzling special effects. At its core though this is pure Aronofsky -- very much of a piece with the rest of his filmography. As both writer and director Aronofsky makes movies about people whose obsessions drive them to madness the mathematician of ""Pi"" the drug addicts of ""Requiem for a Dream"" the romantic dreamer of ""The Fountain"" the wrestler of well ""The Wrestler"" and the ballerina of ""Black Swan."" These are people who are willing to hurt themselves and those around them of pursuit of their elusive destructive passions. Crowes Noah descendant of the peaceful Seth believe the destruction of all mankind is coming and hes all too happy to be a part of it. Lapsed Catholic that I am I dont remember everything about the story of Noahs Ark but I dont believe it played out in such elaborately batshit-crazy fashion. Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel (who also co-wrote ""The Fountain"" fittingly) have made tweaks here and there even while doing tireless research to ensure that certain elements remained authentic. The production which took place in eclectic and unspoiled regions of Iceland features an ark that was ""hand-built to biblically detailed specifications"" according to the press notes. Cubits people -- they count. But before he begins building Noah has a dream. While the details are vague the message from God is clear A fire is coming followed by a flood that will purge and cleanse the Earth. Build an ark load up the animals and start over. Noahs wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly Crowes ""A Beautiful Mind"" co-star) is understandably a little skeptical. But not only is Noah certain of his duty he takes it a step further. He interprets that God wants all of humanity wiped away -- including his family. And hes ready for that. He devotes the next several years to construction with the help of his sons Shem (Douglas Booth) Ham (Logan Lerman) and Japeth (Leo Carroll). Along the way the family adopts a severely injured girl named Ila (Emma Watson Lermans co-star in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"") who eventually will become Shems love. They also enjoy the protection of creatures known as The Watchers -- fallen angels whom a vengeful God has turned into lumbering rock monsters. They are massive and spectacular to behold -- tactile and intimidating but with unexpectedly kind hearts. (Appropriately they are voiced by the gravelly Nick Nolte and Frank Langella among others.) Then they wait for the first drop of rain to fall. And heres where things get a bit soggy. As the overlong ""Noah"" becomes a waiting game its tension sags when it should be at its most gripping. Once the flood comes -- and it is a doozy -- there are some truly terrifying moments at first as Noah strands dozens of innocents their bodies pounded against rocks by ferocious waves their screams so loud they pierce the walls of the vessel. (Similarly pounding is the score from Aronofskys regular composer Clint Mansell -- but at least it makes sense given the bombastic context.) But then theres a lot of down time within the ship rendering too much of ""Noah"" a dour dull affair. While the script allows Crowe some range -- bravery intensity remorse redemption -- the same cant be said for the rest of the impressive cast. Connelly who went to brave lengths in Aronofskys ""Requiem for a Dream"" gets little more to do here than be the supportive wife. The sons are essentially interchangeable. But Anthony Hopkins provides the few rare moments of levity as Noahs grandfather a Yoda-like Methuselah. Ultimately Aronofsky -- known for being an uncompromising filmmaker -- pulls his punches with a finale of colorful joyful uplift. While its lovely to look at its not exactly the best fit for him.

I dont disagree with you but I liked it more than you did. Its the most ambitious movie hes made so I give him credit for that. Reply April 1 2014  by  KHand     Impressed? Just got back from watching ""Noah"". Wow Maybe the most bizarre butchery of a story Ive ever seen But then again maybe I expected too much or too little from this movie. Did I expect to see Giant Rock People? Nope. Did I expect Noah to view the Ark as a suicide mission for him and his family? Nope. I thought God liked Noah and his family and wanted to save them...isnt that why God told him to build the Ark?? Did I expect Noah to be a wanna be Psychotic Baby Killer? Nope didnt see that coming. There were a lot of things in ""Noah"" I didnt expect...that I got. The one thing I didnt get that I expected was a good movie. I give it two thumbs two pinkies two pointers two ring fingers two middle fingers...and two iggly wiggly pigglies DOWN Reply April 17 2014  by  Ernesto     That was a very short and very good review. Thank you..I laughed my ass off Aronofsky is an egotistical and delusional idiot. He let his atheism and view that the Christian market would be lenient with this farce get in the way of a Billion dollar movie. If he would have just held true to the word of God he would have made a fortune. The story is already perfect. Spend your 200 million on the already perfectly written script. Thats all Mel Gibson did....and he was able to turn 25 million into a Billion. Reply March 29 2014  by  Chameleojack     ""[...] and his determination to carry out what he believes is his mission from God leads him to the brink of committing some horrific acts. But you know what? He was right. Despite the protests of doubters all around him -- namely his family -- his vision was clear his faith rewarded."" What? Did you really see this movie? Noahs vision wasnt clear at all he thought hed failed because he couldnt [redacted-go see it] He conveniently decided at the end of it all that it wasnt necessary after all and that god forgave his family (for...?) This was a great movie I loved it and Im a born again atheist. Message to Christians Stop faking reviews saying you saw the movie when you didnt then seeing it and parroting outrage over comparably realistic characterization details. Reply March 30 2014  by  Joseph D. Carpenter     My wife and I saw the first 15 and walked out for a refund. Bottom line if you are looking for a fantasy story about the Biblical story of Noah then your in luck. If you are looking for a biblical truth then look elsewhere. Reply March 30 2014  by  Aaron     Joe... what truths were you looking for in the frst 15 minutes?Was Russel Crowes hair to dark and not light enough like the stories want you to belive? Or was it not set in the right year?If you are going to write a review watch the WHOLE movie before you review it it.Maybe stick with the veggie tales version Reply April 4 2014  by  Nanci Wadsworth     ""...then your in luck."" should be ""...then youre in luck."" fyi Also you missed a very good movie Reply April 10 2014  by  Stephanie     Yeah I staarted to walk out after 1o min but decided to wait it out and give it time to mature. Then I was hit with rock figures i.e. watchers. Really well thats Hollywood for ya. Ive seen plenty of Hollywood takes on biblical stories and was more that ready to be entertained by this one good casting. But the fallen angles depicted as Rock creatures reminded me of The Lord of the Rings. I though I was in the land of enchantment or the forest of Mordor. Then there was the mad Noah aspects. Some like to say that people who speak to God and are given direction to carry out a mission of gods wrath on humanity are schizophrenic and I could buy into that theory too seeing that Noah wanted to kill his entire family and then the twins I had had enough at that point. Couldnt stay to see the last 5 mins of this movie. But heypeople really liked the movie. It just made me laugh and put me to sleep. The special effects didnt even grab my attention. Way to much CGI. Reply March 30 2014  by  DB     Shut up - your IQ is not as high as your diminishing in numbers community have convinced you it is. Points your high powered self-indulgent perception (yes... They exist in great numbers in the Christian camp as well missed... Type Flood (a picture of law that delivers Gods rejected unto death and His chosen unto life - physical). Anti-type Christs blood (a picture of grace that delivers Gods rejected unto death and His chosen unto life - spiritual). Type The Ark (a physical representation of Christ himself - the lives of those spared by grace were safe within from the judgment without). Anti-type Christ Himself (as the scriptures tell us - our lives are hidden in Him) - within Him we are safe and without Him is judgment. I saw the movie - visually stunning deftly inaccurate (we all knew it would be) powerfully acted (Connelly pleading with Noah to spare the babys) and if nothing else motivated me to re-thing the gravity of Gods demand for holiness fom his creation... since we cannot comply He hadvtp provide (Christs finished work atoning for our sins). Lots of unqualified opinions - nothing more... seeing a movie will not quicken our understanding. Reply March 30 2014  by  DanB     I am a Christian and I saw the movie last night. I am disappointed that a movhttp//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_D._Ehrmanie called Noah did not resemble much of the story in the Bible. I would think that Hollywood would want to capitalize on a very willing audience longing for well made biblically accurate movies. I am surprised that it wasnt that entertaining with all the special effects and one of my favorite actors.   I do think most of the people that will see this movie saw it on opening weekend. Hollywood may get it someday if there is any intelligence there. Reply April 4 2014  by  Kerri     Thank you for your review. I appreciate the atheist perspective because as a Catholic that is exactly how I have to view all of these movies based on some Biblical story. The details always seem to be made up and the story just wrong theologically wrong historically and wrong culturally. I try to view them in the same light as ""300"" or ""Robin Hood""- a re imagined fantasy based on some scrap of an event that may have happened long ago. Reply March 30 2014  by  Andrew     ""But ""Noah"" is also the rare big-budget studio movie with a pure faith-affirming message."" Rubbish. The movie didnt affirm faith in anyway unless you mean faith that God is horrendously cruel and humankind is better than God because theyre unwilling to carry out his genocidal schemes. It was a horrible dehumanizing movie that didnt have a shred of faithfulness to the moral and spiritual themes of the original Noah text. Reply March 30 2014  by  C138     With all due respect I think this movie offers some more challenging and complex questions about the Biblical story and the whole concept of faith to its audience than any of Kirk Camerons simplistic and ham-handed sermons. Reply April 4 2014  by  Nanci Wadsworth     I agree C138. I cant believe Christians would prefer Kirk Camerons pablum to a cinema experience that is thought- provoking. Reply April 2 2014  by  Derek     I thought the acting was great. Methuselah was kind of confusing... some sort of wizard?? As many have stated the last third of the movie started straying too far from the original themes making Noah to seem like a baby killing zealot and Gods plan to save the animals but kill all humans who He originally stated mankind would have dominion over. I understand the need for filler but it strayed too far to make the movie as enjoyable as it could have been. Reply April 4 2014  by  Christy Lemire     Thank you guys so much for reading this and sharing your thoughtful perspectives. It was so nice to wake up to all these new comments this morning Reply April 4 2014  by  Rick     Jesus could you get the name right? Its ""James"" Cameron not ""Kirk"" Cameron. This is a professional movie critic? BTW you notice movie critics all have unpleasant deaths? (Ebert Siskel etc| When you make your living criticizing other folks hard work you get karma bitch Reply September 20 2014  by  markzamora     I love how people with little intelligence try to win an argument by name calling with an expletive. Have YOUR facts straight before name calling. Dumbass You probably didnt understand the irony of me calling you a dumbass. Reply April 4 2014  by  Christy Lemire     Hi Rick -- actually I did mean Kirk Cameron. Hes a born-again Christian whos made several movies about the Rapture. But thanks very much for taking the time to read my review and share your thoughts especially on the one-year anniversary of Rogers death. Reply April 8 2014  by  chance     i mustve seen the alternate/international ending. it was much muuuuch darker than the ending you reference and the ending you see on wikipedia. it basically goes into Noah being an alcoholic and the curse of Ham. i think that that ending fit Aronofskys style very well. Reply April 19 2014  by  Jenny Farmer     We went into this movie knowing that it was not biblically correct that it was just loosely based. So with that being said I was neither surprised nor offended by the inaccuracies. The retelling of this story was a lot darker than what I was expecting and so was Noah played by Russell Crowe. Jennifer Connelly as Noahs wife Naameh was just alright in this movie no Oscar performance there. I did like Ray Winstone as the evil Ruler Tubal Cain he was a pretty convincing bad guy. I liked the special effects especially the animals migrating to the arc and was glad to have seen it on the big screen as opposed to at home on a small screen. I really didnt care for the guardian rock monsters they seemed a little far fetched and were a little weird personally. I was expecting Noah to be more of a hero not so dark and scary. The story seemed to drag out at the end it could have been at least 30 minutes shorter in my opinion. Reply April 19 2014  by  Christy Lemire     Thank you for your thoughtful comments Jenny Reply August 3 2014  by  Errolv     I did not expect Noah to be a cinematic quotation of Genesis 6-9. The Bible story simply describes Noahs calling and building the ark. The animals board Noahs family (including wives for all the men) get on the rest of mankind is destroyed. The ark is grounded Noah worships God and later gets drunk. Well ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" is not biblical either. But watching ""Temptation"" for the story you find a fine excursion into the human doubt and desires of a religious leader. Yes within the first ten minutes ""Noah"" is off with non-biblical adventures of rock Watchers and Cains descendants. Lets just drop the Bible story and go for the movie story line. Then it gets stupid. For my part I call the story framework in Noah a ""manufactured plot"". Living with and among Cains people I can handle. But when Tubal-Cain stows away more interested revenge more than preserving his life or when Noah is convinced his family is to be the Last of Man I realized we the audience were being subjected to Aronofskys desire to make a long movie. These manufactured plot points can easily be found n many modern movies. ""Oz The Great and Powerful"" had characters you thought were ""good"" but were actually ""bad"". Michael Bays ""Pearl Harbor"" had a bizarre triangle of love involving an American pilot lost in France but showing up in Hawaii just before December 7. Maybe some people think these manufactured plots make for great movies. To me they border on the edge of the believability you are supposed to suspend. My thumb is down for ""Noah"" Manufactured Plot and too much CGI. Reply August 31 2014  by  Martin Eigenmann     I am neither a faithful Christian nor a Muslim or anything else I just watched the film to get entertained. Well that is the one thing I didnt get by watching it. The film in my eyes is basically just one thing a waist. Most of all a waist of time because most of the time there is nothing happening appart from people and creatures mumbling hard to understand and incoherent phrases and the occasional overdramatic scenes with Lord of the Rings typ battles and special FX. The story lags and there is no emotion in the figures despite the top cast. How can one mess up such a great story combined with such a fantastic cast. Secondly the film is a waist of money I am not worried about the  7.50 for the rental more so about the costs to produce such a boring movie. I dont even want to know the costs but they must be insane. Thirdly the waist of material not to mention the film rolls (or computer power since it is probably produced ""in the box"") what worries me more is all that wood chopped down to recreate the arc and all the water waisted in the rain machines creating the one scene most waited for and in the end equally disappointing the kick in of the flooding rain. For me this film has not one single star out of four. It is in any regard just a waist Second Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

What you might not know about are the rock Transformers. First things first however--which is to note that Darren Aronofskys big-ticket retelling of the biblical legend of Noah (Russell Crowe so damn serious) is a wildly stupid yet still train-wreck-fascinating piece of work. The jaw drops early and often right from an opening dream sequence in which mans fall from grace in the Garden of Eden is presented (laughable digital snake and all) like one of the quick-cut drug montages from the directors Requiem for a Dream (2000). Noahs vision though is different--one not augmented by narcotics but sent by the ""Creator"" (the films offense-tempering euphemism for God) to warn his gruffly subservient acolyte that a cleansing cataclysm is afoot. With the aid of his 1000-years-young grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) and follow-you-anywhere spouse Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) Noah comes to realize that his head trip is a divine call to build that fabled ark. The massive barge of wood and pitch is a spectacular piece of production design that Aronofsky has trumpeted as adhering to the original biblical specifications (""300 cubits long 50 cubits wide and 30 cubits high""). Props for realism I suppose as well as for the alternately verdant and burned-out landscapes--entrancingly photographed by Matthew Libatique in both Iceland and upstate New York--that give a vividly grimy portrait of prediluvial earth. Yet the bad decisions far outweigh the good Start with those rock Transformers towering stone-covered creatures known as ""Watchers"" who speak in the stentorian bassos of Frank Langella Mark Margolis and Nick Nolte. Theyre meant to be a fantastical representation of the fallen-angel race known as Nephilim but they come off like rejects from a Peter Jackson superproduction who are mainly there to up the fanboy-kewl quotient. (Aronofsky proves himself extremely ill-suited to battle scenes so Clint Mansells histrionic score picks up the slack by offering plenty of speaker-shattering gooses.) Theres also a bunch of time-marking melodrama between Noah and his family--specifically some contrived silliness about his son Hams search for a suitable mate--as well as a head-slappingly overcooked performance by Ray Winstone as villainous stowaway Tubal-cain. The large-scale bombast neuters the riskier religious elements aside from a mid-movie sequence that gorgeously and provocatively visualizes the seven days of Creation in sped-up stop-motion. Its here that Aronofsky launches his only stinging salvo presenting a making-of-the-universe that denies neither evolution nor an intelligent guiding hand and is sure to piss off plenty of bloviators on all sides of the spectrum. But its a lone exception in a movie that otherwise makes an oft-told story pompous instead of poetic. By the time that olive-branch-bearing dove perfunctorily flies by weve witnessed a simple parable sunk by its own blockbuster ballast.

"Noah | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; noah ) Noah (United States 2014) March 28 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli It has been a number of years since I have read the story of Noah in ""Genesis"" but Im reasonably certain there are some discrepancies between the canonical account and the one related by director Darren Aronofsky in his new movie Noah. For example I dont recall there being a big War of the Rings-style battle between ""Watchers"" and hoards of men. And there isnat anything in the Bible about a feudal warlord stowing away on the ark and launching a mutiny. Although Aronofskys take on the character of Noah is fascinating - he becomes a rigidly self-righteous man wracked with survivors guilt - the movie as a whole is a mixed bag. Its overlong and a times sluggish. The fights and battles designed to give an epic fantasy feel to the movie are grave miscalculations. And the overabundance of CGI often makes Noah look like a video game. The movie begins with a brief recap of the Old World - how Adam and Eves fall in the Garden led to the wickedness of Noahs time. Aronofsky never uses the term ""God"" to describe the deity; instead he uses the appellation of ""The Creator."" Noah (Russell Crowe) who is descended through the line of Seth (rather than Cain) is deemed to be the only righteous man. After experiencing apocalyptic visions he seeks advice from his grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) a doddering old man who craves freshly picked berries. Methuselah drugs Noah and he experiences more visions. After this he becomes convinced that The Creator is preparing the wipe clean the slate in a massive flood and he has to build an ark to save the animals. The current king of the land Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) doesnt like Noahs defiance and decides to take the ark by force. Noah however has supernatural allies - fallen angels called ""Watchers"" who look like the Stone Giants in The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey and fight against Tubal-cains followers as the rains arrive. Aronofskys telling of Noahs story can be seen as an environmental allegory human beings defile the world; The Creator purges the stain. Noahs prevailing belief is that men and women do not deserve to survive. In his view the only reason he and his family are to be spared is so they can do their duty and shepherd the animals to safety. Repopulation is not on the agenda. The only surviving woman of child-bearing age his adopted daughter Ila (Emma Watson) is barren. Once Noah his wife (Jennifer Connelly) his three sons and Ila die the human race is destined to perish. Even in the face of an apparent miracle his rigid determination doesnt waver. Aronofskys decision to include big special effects-laden battle scenes is curious at best and disastrous at worst. These sequences presumably included to make the film more visually spectacular lapse into lethargy because theres no real sense of tension or danger. We know Noah is going to get the ark underway. We dont care about any of the CGI characters involved. Its just eye candy. This raises larger questions about the pacing. At 138 minutes Noah is too long; there are stretches when it drags. Russell Crowe provides a fascinating interpretation of the title character. Every other depiction I have encountered of Noah presents him as a humble pious man. Crowes Noah is a warrior. He kills more than his share of the unrighteous. He is intractable in his belief that humanity has earned its fate. And when the journey is over and the ark has come to rest in the purified world he is overcome by despair. Irrespective of whether or not the character of Noah is being used as a commentary on modern-day religious zealots who believe they have a monopoly on ""the truth"" its a fascinating and unconventional interpretation of an iconic individual. It may be that Aronofskys vision for Noah has outstripped his ability to deliver. Parts of the film hint at potential greatness but the strengths are undone at least in part by some of the glaring weaknesses. The bizarre decision to turn parts of this tale into a Lord of the Rings-inspired epic fantasy make for some head-scratching moments and the uneven pacing might provoke some restlessness. Those seeking a respectful religiously-slanted interpretation will fall somewhere on the spectrum of ""disappointed"" to ""outraged."" Aronofsky has mentioned that this is not intended to be a biblical movie. In distancing his Noah from its source material and using the ""Genesis"" account as a jumping-off point the director has succeeded. Its in other more basic cinematic areas that he has fallen short.

Though considerably vaster in scope (and budget) than any of the directors previous undertakings it is no less idiosyncratic than his other work from Pi to Black Swan. The result is an odd and original film part CGI spectacle and part somber moral meditation. Although occasionally preposterous it is rarely short of fascinating.Related Story The Terror of Noah How Darren Aronofsky Interprets the Bible Though not a biblical believer himself Aronofsky is clearly at pains to adhere to the spirit--and where possible the limited details--of his adopted text. Following the fall and the first murder humankind descended in two lines the wicked progeny of Cain and the virtuous progeny of Seth. Over the course of eight generations however the Cainites have spread across the globe like a cancer while the Sethians have dwindled until Noah is the last of his line. When the latter comes fully of age (technically when hes around 600 years old though as played by Russell Crowe in the film he seems considerably younger) the Creator decides to purge the corrupted world of life with the exception of Noah his immediate family and as many mated animal pairs as they can squeeze into an ark. Here come the birds spiraling majestically into Noahs giant box of a boat; then the amphibians and reptiles hopping and slithering; and finally a rumbling herd of the hooved toed and clawed. (The fish presumably can fend for themselves.)Working from these familiar beginnings Aronofsky begins his extravagant narrative embroidery. After some early mutual suspicion Noah is befriended by the Watchers grotesque fallen angels that resemble Peter Jacksons Ents except that theyre made out of stone and sport six arms. These powerful creatures (loosely based on references to the Nephilim in Genesis) not only provide the labor to build the massive ark but also protection from the barbarian hordes led by King Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone) who would very much like to book passage on Noahs ship when the rains begin to fall.Aronofsky is quite explicit in his depiction of Noah however righteous as a knowing accomplice in an act of global genocide. The Watchers may be Aronofskys most peculiar addition but there are other fantasy elements woven into his tale as well the glowing energy pellets used to make fire (and primitive firearms); the divine seed with which Noah causes a lush forest to arise from a blighted landscape; the narcotic herbal smoke that he and his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) use to put their zoological passengers into a deep slumber. Adding to the overall air of magic and polytheism are the presences among the cast of an erstwhile Odin (Anthony Hopkins as Noahs grandfather Methuselah) Hermione Granger (Emma Watson as adopted daughter Ila) and Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman as son Ham).But despite its flamboyant and at times goofy fantasy trappings Noah is firmly anchored by the fierce moral intensity of Aronofskys vision which is if anything more Old Testament than the Old Testament itself. Renditions of the Flood narrative--including the Bibles--tend to focus on the lucky fate of Noah and his flock rather than that of the millions left behind to die. Aronofsky by contrast is unsparing in his portrayal of their agonies. The most striking image of the film is a pinnacle of victims that juts briefly above the waves--a human pyramid of desperate clawing terror--before being swallowed by them. Even within the ark the cries of the doomed echo like an infernal whale song.Aronofsky is likewise quite explicit in his depiction of Noah however righteous as a knowing accomplice in an act of global genocide. He is a man who believes that it is Gods will that the human race--all of it his own family included--not be allowed to further corrupt the Earth with its presence. Its a role tailor-made for Crowe whose zealous conviction (evident even in such dubious castings as Les Miserables) is here taken to the brink of madness.Indeed arguably the films greatest infidelities to its source material involve neither igneous angels nor antediluvian dilithium crystals but rather two narrative developments I will not disclose which provide the principal drama and moral tension of the films final third. The first involves a life-or-death faith-or-family ethical dilemma that Aronofsky has invented for Noah (one with powerful echoes of the choice faced by his notable 11th-generation descendant Abraham). And the second involves Aronofskys uses of the character Tubal-Cain the barbarian king.As the film progresses it becomes an dialectic between the moral visions espoused by Tubal-Cain (on behalf of a sinful human race) and Noah (on behalf of a ruthless God).On the one hand Tubal-Cain is a bloodthirsty brute a killer of men despoiler of the land and committed proponent of the ethos that might makes right. On the other hand he is in the most literal sense possible a humanist--particularly in comparison with Noah for whom he serves as a kind of narrative twin and foil. It is Noah after all who believes that ""justice"" requires the end of the human race and Tubal-Cain who argues that women and children (and obviously he himself) have as much right to a berth on the ark as any python or wildebeest. Moreover if Tubal-Cain is in rebellion against God it is at least in part because he believes that God has abandoned humankind. ""No ones heard from the Creator since he marked Cain. We are orphan children"" he laments at one point. At another he beseeches God ""I am a man made in Your image. Why will you not converse with me?""As Aronofskys film progresses it becomes an implicit dialectic between the competing moral visions espoused by Tubal-Cain (on behalf of a sinful human race) and Noah (on behalf of a ruthless God). And to say that neither option is an appealing one--violent chaos versus obedient self-extinction--would be an obvious understatement. A third way between these polar alternatives is of course found as anyone familiar with the Noah story would presume. (Aronofsky may grant himself the latitude to devise a few additional moral quandaries but hes not going to rewrite the ending.)Noah is a strange and occasionally messy hybrid of a film and some viewers will be unhappy not only with the liberties it takes but also with the conclusions it draws (in the latter case perhaps from both ends of the ideological-theological spectrum). Aronofsky has created an epic melodrama that is at the same time a heartfelt personal plea for the reconciliation of often-competing moral codes. ""A man isnt ruled by the heavens"" argues Tubal-Cain late in the movie. ""He is ruled by his will."" In the end Aronofsky suggests neither is sufficient on its own.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace.

We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

C+ Noah Genre Drama; Starring Jennifer Connelly Russell Crowe Anthony Hopkins Emma Watson; Director Darren Aronofsky; Release Date Wide 03/28/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 139; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted April 17 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT In the copy of the Bible sitting on my bookshelf the story of Noah is a pretty brief one. Granted a lot gets packed into that eventful section of Genesis what with the cubit-tabulating the ark-constructing and the two-by-two animal marching all leading up to the mother of all Old Testament climaxes the flood. Still theres hardly enough material there to hang a two-hour-plus Hollywood epic on. So going in to Darren Aronofskys Noah most of us will have already made peace with the idea that certain storytelling embellishments are going to be made. Whether or not audiences will be happy with those changes is another story. In an unpredictibale career thats alternated between telling stories on a small canvas (Pi Requiem For a Dream The Wrestler) and a larger one (The Fountain Black Swan) Aronofsky has always been an audacious and idiosyncratic filmmaker. With its 125 million budget Noah is his broadest canvas yet. And it ends up being a maddeningly schizophrenic experience. On one hand its a remarkably earnest and heartfelt Bible parable not unlike Martin Scorseses darkly existential The Last Temptation of Christ. It contains a handful of gut-wrenching small-scale moments like Noahs decision to spare his grandchildren from sacrifice that are so powerful theyll make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up and salute. On the other though its an excessively flashy Tinseltown spectacle tarted up with all the razzle-dazzle eye candy that a nine-figure price tag can buy. Its as if Aronofsky had so many resources at his disposal he couldnt help but give in to the sin of cinematic gluttony. These two competing impulses seem to be battling for Aronofskys filmmaking soul. And the result is a disappointing draw. Aronofskys wisest move was casting Russell Crowe as Noah. As one of the last descendants of the peaceful line of Seth Noah is a faithful husband to Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) and a loving father of Shem (Douglas Booth) Ham (Logan Lerman) Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll) and the adopted Ila (Emma Watson). Hes the rare piousman in a god-forsaken world of wickedness lorded over by the evil offspring of Cain (led by Ray Winstones fiendish scraggly Tubal-Cain). And Crowe plays this virtuous ascetic with a fiery half-mad intensity and moral weight he hasnt shown in a very long time -- maybe since Gladiator. The problem is that Aronofsky seems to be less interested in his flesh-and-blood characters than the fantastical CGI ones -- namely a strange trippy race of fallen-angel stone monsters called Watchers who look like gigantic piles of smoldering charcoal briquettes and speak with the growly voices of Frank Langella and Nick Nolte. Theyre ridiculous. As the film begins Noah has a vision of a serpent and an apple and humanity drowning in a watery death. He senses that this is a prophecy. That the Creator is going to destroy the world and wash away the wicked. Before that hard rain comes though Noah and his righteous family must prepare. So the ark is built with the help of the Watchers (who come off like antediluvian cousins of the Ents from Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings trilogy) and the animals are gathered in a computer-generated sequence that makes Cecil B. DeMilles parting of the Red Sea look like a cheap dime-store illusion. Meanwhile Shem couples off with Ila the devilish Ham is seduced by Tubal-Cain and Jopheth?well Jopheth just obeys papa and tends to the slumbering camels rhinos and elephants below deck. Its difficult to reduce the fire-and-brimstone wrath of God to a third-act Hollywood money shot but when the flood comes its an event of haunting beauty. The family holes up inside the ark thats being tossed like a cork while the heathens outside howl and scream in anguish. Such is the price to cleanse humanity of its trespasses and start over. Noah is a movie about big ideas (environmentalism heavenly obedience versus earthly love) and even bigger directorial ambitions (how to tell a personal story on the grandest of grand scales). But in the end its also a disappointment. Maybe not one of Biblical proportions but a disappointment nonetheless.

"Holy Men << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous TrueDetectiveSeason2  Next 2014 NL West Preview Facebook Twitter Print Movies Holy Men Russell Crowe in Darren Aronofskys Noah Michael Pena as Cesar Chavez by Wesley Morris on March 28 2014 In Noah a raindrop crashes down near Russell Crowe as if its just left a bomber. That seems right since God has essentially declared war on humanity. We have trashed His planet. Now Hes gonna trash us. Because Noah is a Darren Aronofsky movie the retributive destruction is a bizarre and rather magnificent spectacle. Crowes burly middle-aged Noah (600 is the new 49) drinks some funky tea and envisions building a vessel that will save him his family and the animal kingdom from the floods God has warned will cleanse the planet. His fellow man? Oh well. Tens of thousands of people flee the storm and rush the vessel while enormous beasts made of stone with many arms and light emanating from their chests and faces stomp and swat them into pulp. Sequences like this are a real challenge for a director. He has to see past the fakery to give you awe. Part of what I found so dumb about World War Z was that the unrelenting droves of sprinting zombies werent even fit for a 10-year-old video game. There was no horror to any of the imagery. All Aronofsky knows is horror. You watch these fake rock giants -- theyre apparently fallen angels protecting Noahs family -- wiping out these fake citizens and you feel awe at both the physical and moral proportionality. Aronofsky is doing something new with the bellicosity of the blockbuster principled savagery. There are two or three other sequences here in which the level of filmmaking and the spark of an idea will ignite and youll think as perhaps youve previously thought that Aronofsky is alarmingly talented. This is his sixth film in 16 years -- Pi Requiem for a Dream The Fountain The Wrestler and Black Swan precede it -- and they all have their moments. Noah does too -- when for instance Crowes voice narrates a dreamy doomy montage paraphrased from the Book of Genesis. Or anytime the camerawork (by Aronofskys regular cinematographer Matthew Libatique) is permitted to create a long shot of the spectacular rectangular ark. (It bobs on the water like a floating garage.) Once it floats in the rear of a wide shot where the foregrounded image features desperate wailing people climbing a rock to nowhere. A painting of an image like that was the Hollywood blockbuster of the 1400s. The movie dares to give us a depiction of faith that resides well outside religion. Its spiritual. Noah takes his vision seriously. God he believes has told him mankind is to suffer so suffer it does. His commitment actually veers into zealotry. When Crowes narration ends with him basically saying ""Were all going to die"" the audience laughs. The sufferers include members of Noahs own family. He and his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) have three boys the two elder of whom Shem (Douglas Booth) and Ham (Logan Lerman) are eager for children of their own. But Shems woman Ila (Emma Watson) cant conceive and Hams search for love ends badly before the vessel even takes off and for that he blames his father. Aronofsky and his cowriter Ari Handel have whipped up all this strife and none of it works. Theyve even put a stowaway on the ark a conquering warlord who killed Noahs father and is played with welcome brio by Ray Winstone. Hes the villain and his villainy appeals to Hams filial distemper. But emotional storytelling doesnt come naturally to Aronofsky. One sequence cuts between men tussling in one part of the ark and women handling childbirth in another. He might as well have colored the two halves pink and blue. Most of Connellys and Watsons work on Noah amounts to discovering multiple ways to produce tears. Crowe meanwhile remains committed to the single-minded sort of performance that for the last four or five years has veered in and out of villainy. Hes never needed for us to like him. Thats his singular strength as a star. The intensity remains in his acting but all the shading has gone out of it the ambiguity. We dont need to like who hes playing. We do need to care. Crowe is committed to Noahs crazed overcommitment. Hes just never allowed to see the man for the mania.  Aronofsky often relaxes dramatic problems with drugs sex or gruesomeness. The same is true with Noah. The stuff between the father and his sons or the husband and his wife is meant to illustrate the cost of Noahs certitude his familys contempt. The movie is so committed to its assertion of evolution and its oblique environmentalism and conservationism to living right -- our protagonists appear to be vegans -- that it loses sight of everything else. You watch the scenes of the digital masses trying and dying to get aboard the vessel and feel so much more than you do when Connelly pleads with Crowe to come to his senses. Its the destruction here that turns Aronofsky on. He lives for the unhappy prophesying and gets a kick out of hordes ripping apart a live goat thats just been hurled into a feral crowd. The worry going in was that Noah would turn the Old Testament into 300. Aronofsky prefers a drearier kind of porn the stuff that falls more at the Game of Thrones end of things. Noah wants to be taken seriously but its not a serious movie. Its a mishmash of kitsch and science fiction and political defensiveness barely held together by Aronofskys hubristic talents. Eventually the skies open up water falls in torrents and the camera sails into outer space to show Earth pocked with restless gray swirls. Were told God is the orchestrator of this meteorological acne. True enough but God has a name and its Darren Aronofsky. Noah is most certainly ambitious. Hes taken Chapters 6 through 9 of Genesis and applied a chaotic mix of digital wizardry and manly mumbo jumbo. (""The time for mercy is passed"" says Noah. ""Now our punishment begins."") Aronofsky might be the greatest American director never to direct a great movie. You can always feel him trying though. Hes going for greatness almost every time and every time it wipes you out. You can feel him straining to carry the weight hes put on himself. Sometimes the suspense comes from whether hes thrown out his back. How he managed to keep going after 2000s Requiem for a Dream is anyones guess. But more movies followed. The biggest swing among them until Noah was The Fountain a film about life death and reincarnation that mistook having a vision for being a visionary. Noah wants to be enthralling entertainment and a contemplative work of art. But the trouble with Aronofsky is that hes so determined to achieve both he winds up with neither. Its hard to be James Cameron Peter Jackson and Terrence Malick at the same time. His most popular film Black Swan was as much about the struggle for excellence and ambition and the death drive as his other movies. But he managed to extract a trashy thriller from a high-minded world. He managed to go crazy and have fun. It isnt that Aronofsky should always be entertaining us with his movies. But the prevailing creative tension in most of his work is that he should be studying while everyone else parties. The suffering in these movies extends to him and hearkens back to the math student he used to be He has to show us the work. So he risks pretentiousness every time. You feel for him though. These are the movies of a director still trying to figuring out what kind of filmmaker to be. He fancies himself the Creator on one hand. But really hes a version of Noah tasked with performing a great act and tortured by it.  Cesar Chavez isnt going for too much. Its intimate and elemental. The movie tells the story of the American labor icons creation of the National Farm Workers Association and his fight for workers to be paid a living wage. The Mexican actor Diego Luna directed the movie. Keir Pearson and Timothy J. Sexton are the credited screenwriters and they dont have to work too hard to find resonance between the films 1960s rural Southern California setting and the state of unions and hand-wringing over immigrant workers today. The movie trusts you to free-associate. The Chavez that Michael Pena plays is mild-mannered and pacifist but so determined to make change that he stints on his fatherly duties. Its his only shortcoming and it haunts him. But the movie presents Chavezs achievements as a community project. A woman named Dolores Huerta (Rosario Dawson) helped create the NFWA. Chavezs wife Helen (America Ferrara) and his brothers Richard (Jacob Vargas) and Librado (Roberto Sosa) were at his side. And Senator Robert Kennedy (Jack Holmes) swoops in twice and aims his righteousness at the farm owners. The film culminates with Chavezs 25-day hunger strike and a mounting international boycott of table grapes. And it manages to get at that part of a moviegoer that craves justice. Nixons election is a boon for the farmers. The heartless owners crooked law-enforcement guys and compromised politicians are all white. And most of them wear horn-rimmed glasses which in the movies have come to signify immorality if not downright evil -- theyre racist eyewear. (The activists see just fine.) Here John Malkovich wears a pair. (He also wears a terrific grayish curled wig.) The simmering grape grower he plays feels contempt for Chavez and kinship with him. Malkovichs character immigrated from Eastern Europe turned nothing into something and feels like the NFWA wants to take what is his. This is the films most complex creation. But the simplicity works here. This is a Mexican man making a film about a Chicano civil-rights activist. The point of view is rare and Luna doesnt use it for epicness. The movie isnt exactly subtle (""I want to get my hands dirty"" is a line typical of this Chavez) but its attuned to the stakes of the farmers plight and doesnt need an interloper to shout on their behalf. Indeed a white lawyer (Wes Bentley) arrives and remains part of the moral wallpaper. I like the crackle of anger the movie passes on. Its not cheap. Lunas not trying to manipulate you. Hes working in a plain realist style that incorporates some actual news footage into the proceedings and places Penas absorbing sense of understatement at the center. His fair-skinned babys face looks nothing like Chavezs. But Luna understands that Pena has that rare quality in an actor -- pure goodness. Its as good as starriness since even in movies that give him nothing to play -- he was the FBI agent who played the impostor sheikh in American Hustle -- Pena draws you in. He was heartbreakingly good with Nicolas Cage in World Trade Center and funnier than anybody else in 30 Minutes or Less. But these two movies werent hits and the hits hes been in havent given him a proper showcase. This is a starring part and he doesnt act up a storm to get another. He doesnt give it The Role of a Lifetime treatment. Luna really directs him well. He knows an audience will follow him. When Penas Chavez tears up while defending his aversion to radicalism in a speech to agitated farmworkers you tear up. When he takes that hunger strike your stomach grumbles. Sally Field and Hilary Swank are two of the only living actors capable of doing this to an audience forging unbreakable sympathy. With Pena the question is this Are the movies brave enough to give him the chance he deserves? Hes a wonderful Cesar Chavez. Hed make a fantastic Noah too.

Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 28 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 28 2014 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Darren Aronofsky Written by Darren Aronofsky Ari Handel Starring Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly Emma Watson Classification PG Year 2014 Country USA Language English Darren Aronofskys best film remains his first Pi (1998) an ultra-low-budget thriller about a man who believes that the God of the Old Testament is trying to tell him something about the end of days.Fifteen years five movies and one Academy Award nomination later Aronofsky has returned to essentially the same tale in Noah at a greater scale and with considerably diminished artistic returns. The lasting achievement of Pi was that it made a gritty little story about a mad mathematician feel cosmically significant. In Noah the director takes perhaps the most spectacular chapter of the Greatest Story Ever Told and renders it utterly underwhelming. The drab under-lit look of Noah which was shot by Aronofskys talented long-time cinematographer Matthew Libatique represents an attempt to ground myth in reality - to quite literally ground it in acres and acres of mud. TIFF 2010 Natalie Portmans Black Swan The film opens with humanity floundering under the mark of Cain whose murder of his brother Abel was the straw that broke civilizations back. From what we can see Noah (Russell Crowe) and his brood - including his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) their three sons and his wayward grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) - are the only decent people for miles in every direction.These early passages resemble nothing so much as the film version of Cormac McCarthys The Road with our heroes beset by roving gangs of vandals; in one encounter they rescue an orphaned girl Ila and adopt her gratefully into the family circle. Ila will grow up to be played by Emma Watson and as such into an object of desire for Noahs elder sons Shem (Douglas Booth) and Ham (Logan Lerman) despite the fact that a childhood injury has rendered her barren. Meanwhile back in town (such as it is) the masses gather behind Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) a self-styled conqueror who can tell that something big is about to happen and refuses to miss the boat on an escape plan.Aronofskys great theme as a filmmaker is the individual who destroys him or herself in an attempt to achieve perfection whether represented by a beautiful mind (Pi) or a flawless physical performance (The Wrestler Black Swan). In Noah though the protagonist is compelled by external forces Noah receives his marching orders directly from God via elaborate CGI-enhanced visions that suggest that the Creator (or maybe the director) has worn out his Blu-ray of Tree of Life.The gravitas of Noahs knowledge that the majority of life on Earth is about to be wiped out clashes with the oversized absurdity of much of whats going on around him including the clans collaboration with a group of giant rock monsters (actually fallen angels) who whatever their actual scriptural origins look and sound like creatures from other high-end blockbusters - gigantic refugees from The Lord of the Rings.These and other gimmicky touches suggest that Aronofsky is trying to justify his projects massive cost and yet its obvious that what hes really after is a sense of intimacy. The films second half set inside the Ark as the storm rages outside is basically a sea-bound psychodrama that finds Noah wrestling with a form of survivors guilt and channelling it against the other passengers.Where a great daring writer like Timothy Findley was able to make the claustrophobia and sexual paranoia of a mixed family adrift resonate in his ingenious Great Flood riff Not Wanted on the Voyage Aronofsky and his co-writer Ari Handel struggle to create authentic drama and so fall back on action-movie cliches. The point at which Noah stops dead so that two burly movie stars can roll around on the ground pummelling one another is when some viewers may start to suspect that the director is piloting his own gigantic vessel on cruise control.The film is not without its moments One shot of a rocky outcropping teeming with people trying to escape the rising tide is borderline-Boschian and an intelligently designed recap of the Creation myth provocatively overlays Old Testament language on images of evolution. But most of whats on offer here feels depressingly familiar especially Crowes performance which doesnt deviate from the actors track record of hard manful glowering; frankly he was much better playing a man caught between his loved ones and a larger sense of duty in The Insider (which also featured some more authentically visionary hallucinations to boot).As for the other actors theyre badly wasted especially Connelly whose screen time mostly consists of grinding herbs to put the Arks non-human passengers to sleep (which also cuts down on the special-effects budget since that means we never really have to see the critters in action).What could have made Noah work is the same sense of urgency - of fateful craziness - that made Pi so memorable and which also factored into the fatal obsessions of The Wrestler and Black Swan (two very flawed movies that admittedly benefited from stronger lead performances than the one here).Even Aronofskys much-derided 2006 feature The Fountain a wannabe Kubrickian epic about love and eternal recurrence felt at least like a movie the director had to make. Noah never quite achieves the grandeur its reaching for maybe because in the end the director isnt really stretching all that far. He has upped the weight but he hasnt raised the bar.

Theres a symphony of visuals here and big strange ideas but when it comes to the actual characters we get automatons sleepwalking through cliches. Taking up perhaps three pages in the Bible the story of ""Noah"" is now a 130-minute movie - and you thought Warner Brothers were milking every last drop out of the books for ""The Hobbit."" After a brief artfully cut recap of the story of creation - complete with a Foleyd-in CRUNCH after Eve plucks the fruit of knowledge from the tree of life - and a prologue where Noahs father is slain by the polluting meat-eating brute descendants of Cain who live in the cities of men we finally meet grown-up Noah as played by Russell Crowe. Noah and his family protect and preserve Gods creation - unlike those squalid children of Cain with their mines and metal - and Noah gets a vision full of blood seeping through black soil and a drowned world of bloated corpses. Confused he visits his father Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins playing Anthony Hopkins) and after another vision realizes he has to build an Ark to preserve two of each animal while God destroys the world with a flood to begin again. ""Fire destroys"" he notes. ""Water ... cleanses."" It should be noted that while Noahs family - including wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) sons Shem (Douglas Booth) Ham (Logan Lerman) and Japeth (Leo McHugh Carroll) as well as adoptive daughter Ila (Emma Watson) - are on-board both literally and figuratively Noah thinks that between Naamehs age and Ilas barren-ness God wants his family to save the animals and then quietly peacefully die preserving creation for the innocent animals. (It should be noted that Genesis has God explicitly say that Noahs sons and their wives will be on the Ark.) While its fun to imagine the Paramount pitch meeting Aronofsky made - ""Its a 150-million movie about a religious fanatic eco-terrorist whose biggest concern is that his suicide mission isnt going to end the way he wanted it to and his biggest hero moment is when he refuses to commit infanticide"" - it also makes for a somewhat dour sour film. Future academic papers will Im sure be written about the changes liberties and alterations screenwriters Aronofsky and Ari Handel made to the story of Noah. The clean Old Testament prose phrase ""There were giants in the earth those days"" is the rationalization for CGI ""Watchers"" fallen angels trapped in bodies made of stone and rock whose CGI looks somehow both expensive and cheap but whose multiple arms come in handy for smiting when the armies of Cain attack. And thats one of the huge problems with ""Noah"" specifically in that it combines the simplicity of the prose and storytelling of Genesis with the simple-minded nature of the modern blockbuster. Not only must Noah now be a badass who can fight but the greedy King who comes to try and steal the ship (Ray Winstone looking stunningly like Mickey Rourke in ""The Wrestler"") is the man who killed his father culminating in a knife-fight in the bowels of the Ark between the two that includes the most dramatically convenient moment of turbulence since ""Non-Stop"" a few months ago. You cant help but feel a little bad for Aronofsky - Paramount wanted him to make a 150-million movie because they think thats the only kind of movie they can make money on these days and he would prefer to make movies as opposed to not make movies so here he is surrounded by more money than he knows what to do with making a movie that feels more and more like ""Transformers"" or ""Waterworld"" than it does a depiction of a central story in the Judeo-Christian faith. Aronofsky uses many of his standby visual motifs here - repetition and quick cuts hallucinatory visions - but his version of creation itself late in the film feels like a bored science teacher pressing fast-forward on a nature documentary shot by Terrence Malick. W.H. Auden cautioned against those who ""read the Bible for its prose"" but after ""Noah"" perhaps the better warning is to look out for those people who read the Bible for its potentially profitable widescreen IMAX action scenes.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In this the first year A.H. -- After Ray Harryhausen -- director Darren Aronofsky has created a ""Noah"" more about movies than the source material. This might strike some as good news. Disappointing is more like it. You may recall that Ray Harryhausen (who died last May) was the special-effects genius behind a number of stop-motion action pictures from the 1960s and 70s. And for all its solemnity and severe and sincere performances by Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly and Emma Watson in particular ""Noah"" shares more DNA with the Saturday morning Cheez Whiz of ""Jason and the Argonauts"" than ""The Ten Commandments."" Watching Cecil B. De-Milles Old Testament epic on a loop would be more enjoyable but also more edifying than sitting through this bloated outing again. Crowes hefty talent dovetails well with Noahs burden. He carries the weight of a doomed world. The Creator has saddled him with signs he will bring mankind to an end not by fire as his grandfather Methuselahs father believed but with a deluge. Sir Anthony Hopkins portrays the Bibles oldest human. Connelly portrays Noahs wife Naameh with fine intelligence in a role that requires tight-lipped support and achy suffering in equal measure as Noah begins turning his back on mankind and executing his duty. Theres much work to be done once its clear that the Creator will soon turn Destroyer. Noah enlists the help of beings known as Watchers to build the massive ark. These fallen angels based on the Nephilim found in Genesis resemble granite Transformers that have been encased in gray stone once they plummeted to Earth. This special effects-laden saga does have its share of creatures great and small and stony and scaled. What it lacks is fresh insight from Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel. Yes it appears Noah was an early environmentalist but is that enough of a contemporary notion to sustain a two-plus-hour drenching? As Noahs nemesis Tubal-Cain Ray Winstone provides the face and force of avarice and offence. He even tries to tempt Noahs unhappy middle son Ham (Logan Lerman) to his understanding of the Creators role for man dominion. The movie takes something of a ""Shining"" turn when Noah learns Shem (Douglas Booth) and Ila (Watson) may experience a miracle. All work and no play make Noah ... ""Noah"" is not without some movie magic. A dream scene of animals swimming from the depths toward the ark Noah in their midst is otherworldly and touching. The trouble here is so little else stirs. Which seems a strange thing to take from a film about the end of the world (wicked or no) or about the human relationship to an Old Testament Creator complex and so often beyond our fathoming.

What in heavens name were they expecting? In the Old Testament original God wipes out all but a handful of people while ensuring the survival of every sort of beast -- and yet the fundamentalists are incensed because the movies Noah doesnt eat meat and thinks that humans have been poor caretakers of their God-given Earth. They should be delighted that in an age marked by nihilism and widespread dismissal of Judeo-Christianity as a bunch of mismatched fairy tales a 125 million Hollywood movie peddles the idea of an all-seeing deity with the power and inclination to wipe out humanity as a punishment for moral degeneracy. Like it or not this apocalyptic film has been made by an artist who believes in the authenticity of religious visions. It has also alas been made by an artist in thrall to an all-seeing studio with a lot of money on the line which means its Aronofskys least personal work. So you get a fat dose of conventional melodrama with your Old Testament Its the antediluvian Gladiator. The bad guys are identified as descendants of Cain the original fratricidal sinner and theyve been busy wiping out the spawn of the brother that came after Abel Seth. (Poor Seth the overlooked sibling. Id forgotten all about him -- you?) Few of Seths progeny are left. Theres Russell Crowes Noah; Crowes wife from A Beautiful Mind (Jennifer Connelly) as Noahs spouse Naameh; their kids Ham (Logan Lerman) Shem (Douglas Booth) and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll); and a rescued orphan who grows up to be Hermione Granger and goes by the name Ila. While the Cain-ites kill fornicate eat meat and despoil the natural world the Seth-ites cower amid rocks tilling their veggies and hoping for a miracle. And then it comes. Noah dreams that God -- here referred also to the rights mysterious ire as ""Creator"" -- will give the Earth what wed nowadays call a ""reboot."" He has another similar vision after his hermit grandfather (Anthony Hopkins -- yes him again) gives Noah a drink laced with the biblical equivalent of acid. Noah and his family get busy building a great ark much to the displeasure of Ray Winstones Tubal-cain the man who killed Noahs father (backstory) and doesnt care much for Noah either. Winstones snarling Tubal-cain is more fun than Russell Crowes priggish Noah but the role is an excrescence. Its there so Noah can build to an action climax along the lines of President Harrison Ford kicking terrorist Gary Oldman off Air Force One while snarling ""Get off my plane"" This is ""Get off my Ark"" Another multiplex-friendly addition is the group of angels whove fallen to Earth and become boulders that now and again assemble themselves into giants like primordial Transformers trash-talking Noah and throwing things at the Cain-ites. Theyre impressive though. In an inspired touch one of the giant rock creatures is voiced by the gravelly Nick Nolte - an inspired match. The chief invention of Aronofsky and his co-writer Ari Handel is to make Noah pull a sort of Abraham. That is he comes to believe the Creator wishes him to save the animals -- as innocent now as they were in the Garden of Eden he says -- but sacrifice the vile humans including his own kids and grandkids. So in the last part of the film Noah spends a lot of time chasing people around the ark like its a slasher movie while his wife and kids plead for mercy. Why not? Maybe this Noah is a bit unhinged but its not as if hes totally out of his mind The foreordained floodwaters did come. And why wouldnt the God of the Old Testament want to scrap the beta version of humanity and give it another go? Crowe never goes soft on the character Noah is a grave traumatized unlikable man. Its a bracing conceit and theres a scene in which he lets a helpless character perish -- to the horror of his son -- thats genuinely shocking. But a protagonist this inflexible doesnt have the kind of stature youd hope for in a biblical epic. Hes a bit monotonous -- a bit of a thickie. Probably wed identify with him more if Aronofsky took us into his head more often. The directors other films are told from the inside out the brilliant mathematical fever dream Pi; the jittery tale of addiction in all its forms Requiem for a Dream; the potent psychodramas The Wrestler and Black Swan with their protagonists compelled to ever-higher heights of self-abuse. Each character in his or her disastrous way longs for a sense of connectedness a higher power. Thats what Aronofskys Noah taps into which is why the films most vivid scenes are the dreams and visions not the conventional spectacle. You do need spectacle in an apocalypse though which here means a ton of computer-generated imagery. Animal activists are evidently pleased that not only were no animals harmed no animals were used. The river of beasts flowing into the ark is an awesome sight. But then the animals go to sleep and cease to be a factor. And theres a puzzling omission We never see them stir when the waters recede and head out into the new world. It would have cost a few million more -- but as Butch Cassidy would say ""Small price to pay for beauty."" Despite its compromises I like Noah well enough. It grounds the biblical apocalypse in the here and now tapping into the dystopian mood while retaining a sense of religious awe. Maybe thats why the fundamentalists hate it. It makes too much damn sense. Tagsmoviesmovie reviewnoahdarren aronofsky Share on Facebook Tweet this Story Top Stories How 80s Are the Names on Stranger Things?

The new biblical spectacle Noah runs 138 minutes. The laws of mathematics suggest the filmmakers particularly director Darren Aronofsky had to come up with some new material.Some of the subsequent decisions are questionable. For instance the Watchers the fallen angels who help Noah build his vessel look like mineral creatures that escaped from Fraggle Rock. The first third creaks a little. But once it gets moving and building and floating Noah pulls off an impressive feat. It captures the torment of one chosen as an instrument by a vengeful Old Testament God and it breaks a story of cosmic dimensions into brutally human terms.Russell Crowe plays Noah as a proud family man beset by dreams of annihilation by water. He seeks out his grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) who serves Noah some very potent tea that helps him see his mission. To its credit Noah skips any and all booming intonations from above; voice-of-God narration works great in March of Time newsreels not so well in biblical epics. Besides all that talk of cubits and cypress wood would make for pretty dry cinema.Instead we get an epic battle between the army of Cains descendent Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone a worthy adversary) and Noahs Watchers. (Despite his villain status Tubal-cain should thank Aronofsky for elevating him from the ranks of fringe Bible characters.) We get a flood that begins as rain turns into towering geysers shooting from the ground and crests as all-out destruction. Aronofsky struggled with the massive canvas of The Fountain before regaining his footing with intimate gems (The Wrestler Black Swan). Here he conjures moments of genuine awe while only occasionally bludgeoning us with digital excess.More important he doesnt shy away from the storys pitch-dark implications. Over the years the public imagination has turned the tale of Noahs Ark into a sort of childhood fable. Its actually a story of apocalypse engineered by a God who decides he wants to wipe out mankind and start afresh. The film incorporates touches of Abraham and Isaacs story that emphasize Noahs role as not merely an instrument of God but also a potential instrument of death. No wonder he looks a tad overburdened.The second half of Noah is fraught with dilemmas of morality and loyalty the consequences facing a man who wants to do right by both his species and his God. The movie really earns its keep in the hull of the ark as Noahs family (Jennifer Connelly Logan Lerman Emma Watson Douglas Booth and Leo McHugh Carroll) gazes with a degree of horror upon what their leader has become. Crowe wears Noahs trials well his perfectly round head filling the screen his eyes flickering with the strain of his ever-escalating task.It cant be easy to create a psychologically dense Biblical epic in this day and age a movie that can please literalists scholars and plain ol blockbuster excitement seekers. Aronofsky proves impressively uncowed (and un-birded and un-snaked) by the challenge. Hes got guile and his movie embraces the idea of a demanding Old Testament God whose demands have profound mortal consequences.NOAH (B+)Directed by Darren Aronofsky.

"Noah | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Noah Print Page Email Page Search Noah (2014; Rated ) A "" One of the most dazzling and unforgettable Biblical epics ever put on film."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Noah(2014; PG-13)In theaters Friday 28 March 2014Genre Adventure DramaDirector Darren AronofskyCast Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly Anthony Hopkins Emma Watson New Richard Roeper reviews weekdays at 500 PM ET only on REELZCHANNEL (10) Post a Comment  Angelsaid on Monday December 08 2014 110002 AMThis is the worst movie Ive ever seen I was disappointed that such great actors as Russell Crowe and Anthony Hopkins would be associated with this movie. Its obvious that the writer(s) director and everyone else involved with this movie have not read the Bible; or maybe they think we have not read the Bible and wouldnt know the difference.... This movie should have been listed in the ""science fiction"" category and I enjoy science fiction story lines;  but even so it was a very boring 2 1/2 hours. cleysaid on Friday April 18 2014 64652 PMEven if this movie was not the famous biblical saga it would have been a terrible movie. I understand there is not a lot of story with a family floating around in a boat.......so dont make the movie. Belinda said on Monday April 14 2014 41834 AMDespite some of the negative criticism I enjoyed this film. I thought it was a sensational epic and once again Darren Aronofsky has delivered a cast led by Russell Crowe who gives a raw performance. arno jacobsensaid on Thursday April 10 2014 45341 PMI wanted to see this before anyone reviewed and read their comments. One of the worst films I have ever seen.The story line rambles along. The rocks that turn into monsters are stupid. what a waste of acting talent on a dumb film. A 100 million down the crapper. Billsaid on Monday March 31 2014 123748 PMI must have seen a different Noah. I think it was the WORSE movie I have ever seen. It is obvious that the writer director or anyone involved in making this movie has ever read the Bible. It was just plain STUPID. I would give it a ""F"" not only that but a double ""FF"". Reply from Richard Roeper Worst. Not ""worse.""DCWhatthesaid on Sunday March 30 2014 63029 PMIt would be sad if this flick did poorly because of the religious stigma. Until reading Richards review I honestly was going to skip it. Even afterwards it took some major coaxing amp; promises to get my wife to see it with me. It could just have easily been about a gene researcher facing ethical obstacles dealing with threats to her conscience. This is about a man with a strong sense of right and wrong. He also has a strong conviction that human beings are not worth saving; which I cant always argue with. But the difference between the Noah character and our own self-righteous indignation is that Noah includes himself among the unworthy. The flip side near the end explores what can happen when ones moral convictions are off the mark when one parks ones brains amp; heart at the door and ignores something that rivals conscience - compassion. The religious angle could be considered backdrop. The core of the story is about a human being wrestling with right amp; wrong moral conviction amp; possible insanity compassion and firmness. Its about us about any of us who sometimes doubt whether were doing the right thing and is worth checking out. Marksaid on Friday March 28 2014 103058 PMI just saw ""Noah"" Very good movie and here is how I plan to explain it to my kingdom kids...Supermans dad is chose by God to make the ark so he and his wife (Hulks Girlfriend from ""Hulk"") along with his kids including the new ""Romeo"" and ""Percy Jackson"" cross the land find Hermione Granger who fancies Romeo and after talking to Thors Dad they build the ark despite the growing threat of Ares from the first ""Percy Jackson"" movie (or if you want Beowulf)......understand? Steven Freekinsaid on Friday March 28 2014 60836 PMThis film is a great masterpiece of biblical scale. Its the best bible film since ""Passion of the Christ."" Even though its an ancient story of mankind it also reflects our world today. Its ironic really but then again its human nature. The best movie Ive seen so far this year. The story is definitely more than we imagined. Chrissaid on Friday March 28 2014 30908 PMJust wanted to say thanks Richard for showing me which movies to go spend my hard earned money on over the years. You amp; I rarely disagree and I always look forward to hearing your input. Scooty Bsaid on Thursday March 27 2014 94428 PMI just wish someone would bring the ""Book of Enoch"" into this. I am a Christian and I seeing the Bible making a comeback I guess Hollywood has nothing more to write than stories about the Bible and Marvel Comic super heroes unless it is a remake of another told story.

Sure movies based on biblical material have been made numerous times in the past and Ridley Scotts upcoming ""Exodus"" with Christian Bale as Moses suggests the Old Testament well has not run dry. But most scripture-based films were made in a vastly different era of American cultural history when Hollywood was devoted to delivering ""family entertainment"" and Christian fundamentalism barely existed as a social force. More recently its been important to choose a side Martin Scorseses ""Last Temptation of Christ"" and Mel Gibsons ""Passion of the Christ"" were aimed at different audiences. This mightily strange motion picture however is a classic Hollywood blend of ""devils candy"" - a major movie star the control-freak auteur of ""Black Swan"" a budget reported at 130 million and one of the sketchiest episodes in the Abrahamic tradition drawn from a few sentences in the Book of Genesis - designed to please everyone and likely to please almost no one.So theres the bad news ""Noah"" is a highly ambitious movie but in many ways a failure. Its almost certain to wind up in that category critic Stuart Klawans has described as ""film follies"" large expensive and often career-swamping dream projects in the tradition pioneered by Erich von Stroheims ""Greed"" and D.W. Griffiths ""Intolerance."" (A one-word title often seems to be a key ingredient ""Metropolis"" ""Cleopatra"" ""Fitzcarraldo"" ""Ludwig."" Clearly Francis Coppola should have dropped the ""Now"" and just gone with ""Apocalypse."") But as with so many such follies ""Noah"" is also worth seeing and not just as a slow-motion car wreck made at vast expense. Amid the CGI elephants the Nick Nolte stone giants the overacting and dialogue howlers the WTF science-fiction flights of fancy and the attempt to wrest a dramatic plot out of a bare-bones mythological narrative theres considerable daring fire and passion in this tale of watery apocalypse. Not to mention a character perfectly suited to Russell Crowe at his most brooding and portentous. If we say that Crowe plays Noah as a domineering patriarch with an antediluvian moral code I guess for once thats not a metaphorTheres so much delusion and so much delight in ""Noah"" that I have trouble distinguishing one from the other or determining whether its most outlandish flourishes qualify as mistakes or as strokes of genius. But lets be clear that the CGI-animated opening sequence an ""earlier on our show"" montage that tells the story of Genesis from the creation through Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel is a mistake. Even there Aronofsky and cinematographer Matthew Libatique deliver striking images - the forbidden fruit of the Tree of Knowledge pulsing like a human heart; the father and mother of us all as golden-hued naked super aliens - but the net effect is something like a Catholic Sunday-school video mixed with the scenes Ridley Scott rejected as too hokey for ""Prometheus.""Thats how we get to the quasi-modern allegorical portion of the story a labored vegan-environmental parable that has apparently upset some Christian viewers. On one hand we have the doomed descendants of Cain who have built a great ""industrial civilization"" that has polluted the earth both literally and figuratively (that is with mining sludge and dead machines and also with sexual misdeeds). Then theres Noah who is descended from Seth the third son of Adam and Eve (that parts definitely in the Bible) and who lives out in the wilderness in hippie-mystical simplicity literally raising his family on roots and berries (that part not so much). That family includes Jennifer Connelly as Noahs unnamed wife Douglas Booth and Logan Lerman as his sons Shem and Ham and Emma Watson in an inflated and largely invented daughter-in-law role. None of them is as interesting as the diabolical and charismatic Tubal-Cain (growly voiced Ray Winstone) king of the Cain faction who vows to kill Noah and take that damn ark for himself if the promised great flood actually shows up. Tubal-Cain is a great character full of venal and crude humanity part Miltons Satan and part Nietzschean Superman and is also 99 percent made up. (In the Bible he is described as a maker of ""all kinds of bronze and iron tools."" Thats it.)Now Im pretty sure that Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel understood they were damned no matter what they did when it came to adapting the brief and often bewildering account of the Genesis flood into a recognizable movie screenplay with human characters and a three-act structure. I suspect they would also tell you theres some basis for all their eccentric interpretations either in the biblical text itself or in the centuries of Jewish and Christian theology that followed. Theres apparently a rabbinical tradition that Tubal-Cain was the inventor of weapons and warfare for instance. You Might Also Like This brings us I suppose to the Watchers giant shambling creatures made of stone who help Noahs family build the ark and also protect them against the rampaging hordes of Tubal-Cain in a tremendous and ridiculous battle sequence that has no relationship to anything in the Bible. Theres an extremely long-winded theological back story about how these guys are fallen angels who got coated in molten lava and no Im not even kidding. Alert readers of the Bible will recognize them as the mysterious Nephilim described in Genesis 6 as ""sons of God ... heroes that were of old"" and the source of much exegetical agony. Thats all fine and dandy I guess; Aronofsky and Handel have defined certain rules to their universe and want to convince us (or themselves) theyre sticking to them. In fact the Watchers are part Transformers part J.R.R. Tolkiens Ents and partly that orange dude made of rocks from the Fantastic Four. In my universe thats enough.Theres no way to be entirely faithful to the source material without being ludicrous and Aronofsky and Handel have simply skipped over the most troublesome parts of the Old Testament account. In the text Noah is 600 years old at the time of the flood making his sons somewhere around 100 apiece. (Yeah I know; aging was different back then or something.) God gives repetitious and conflicting instructions about the animals on the ark Bring ""two of every kind"" except for the ""clean"" animals whatever they may be; bring seven pairs each of those. Oh and dont forget ""every kind of food that is eaten."" Pack enough of that to feed your family plus all those animals. For 150 days. That issue is completely ducked by the way; the animals show up on their own buzzing hopping and crawling two by two in a big CGI parade and then Noah and his sons move through the ark with some kind of magical incense dispenser that makes them all go to sleep and not eat each other. Brilliant God is never a character in ""Noah"" although he has more lines of dialogue than anyone else in the original text and his petulant but specific instructions to Noah come in the form of a dream that seems highly ambiguous at best. OK you dreamed about water and a big boat - well clearly that means that God is going to destroy all life on earth except for you and your family Throughout this story - which in the original barely qualifies as a story at all -- you can feel Aronofsky trying to split the difference between antiquity and modernity. On one hand God is a spiteful bastard whos had quite enough of the world of human beings after barely 10 generations and wants to wipe the slate clean. On the other Noah is a conflicted father in psychological-realist style torn between his deranged sense of Creator-derived mission (the word ""God"" is never used) and his love for his family.Theres no real risk of issuing a spoiler to this story is there? The water comes in spectacular fashion and then it goes; the ark beaches itself on Ararat where Noah gets drunk and passes out naked. (That absolutely is in the Genesis account although its significance - like the significance of the whole damn story -- is not entirely clear.) Visually ""Noah"" is impressively bleak and grand the whole way through but to my taste the human drama is greatly depleted once Winstones Tubal-Cain departs along with Anthony Hopkins as Methuselah Noahs 969-year-old herbalist-healer grandfather. ""Noah"" is a grandiose and baffling journey thats almost worth taking a free-form adaptation of one of the worlds most famous myths that halfheartedly tries to appease those who long to take it literally. When it connects its awesome and when it doesnt its awesomely silly. If its a bad idea at least its a bad idea on a grand scale and a better bad idea than 90 percent of the ones that reach the screen from Hollywood. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet God only knows how Darren Aronofsky convinced a major movie studio to hand him the keys to its proverbial kingdom. But here as if by divine miracle is a 125 million Biblical epic from the director of Requiem For A Dream and Black Swan. The money is all up there on-screen--in the creation of a mighty torrential downpour; in the construction of a towering ark to brave the waves; and in the migrating CGI menagerie that comes to fill the boat. But if the suits at Paramount were expecting a work-for-hire blockbuster they should have bankrolled a different visionary. Unlike his title character Aronofsky bows to no higher power. Hes built this grand vessel to his own specifications obeying only the voices screaming in his head. Noah in other words belongs to that rare class of auteuristic religious opus in which (often secular) filmmakers twist Scripture to suit their own artistic obsessions. Theoretically thats cause for celebration but is the movie itself worthy of praise? Appreciating it in principle--for its singularity and audacity for its refusal to strictly play by the (good) book--is much easier than worshipping at the altar of Aronofskys actual achievement. In adapting one of the most famous of Old Testament tales the director and his regular co-writer Ari Handel have taken wild artistic liberties with the source material embellishing the basic narrative with romantic subplots digital armies environmentalist subtext and monologues from a typically hammy Anthony Hopkins. The result is a monolithic slab of Biblical fan fiction at once deeply serious and seriously silly. Its a mess but at least its the mess its creators wanted. Theres reason beyond sheer costliness that the story of Noah and the great flood hasnt made its way to the big screen too regularly. What is this Sunday-school staple but a saga of righteous genocide building inexorably to a triumphant mass cleansing? Rather than run from such grimness Aronofsky embraces it touching upon survivors guilt as well as the war--raging in his heros head--between empathy and marching orders. This Noah created in the bearded suitably grungy image of Russell Crowe is a man haunted by holy obligation. The final descendant of Seth Adams third son he lives in a barren wilderness protecting his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and three sons from the wicked bountiful progeny of Cain. When God speaks to Noah its not by direct booming address but through the mortals dreams--of sinister serpents of throbbing forbidden fruit of bodies floating in the apocalyptic drink. From these visions the man cobbles together an imperative If he builds it they will come. Yes even the snakes. More indebted to Peter Weirs The Last Wave than to Cecil B. DeMille Noah dares to locate a thin line between belief and madness devotion and zealotry. When the Almighty communicates only in signs how is a faithful follower to tell delusions from duties? Crowe his wearied features framed by a scraggly gray beard internalizes this conflict with anguished conviction. But he hasnt been cast simply for the stoniness of his stares but also for his way with a blade. For all its admirable moral inquiry Noah also aspires to a modern tradition of grimy fantasy epic--a genre mode that clashes violently sometimes comically with its pretensions of seriousness.Doing his best Ridley Scott impersonation Aronofsky orchestrates a pointless mud-splattered battle sequence. The barbarian hordes seeking sanctuary within Noahs ark are led by Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) a Biblical second-stringer that the film repurposes as its sneering villain. His arguments against the silent deity whos abandoned his ""orphan children"" would sound persuasive were they not spilling from the mouth of a character who primarily exists to be vanquished. (His greatest sin in this uniquely PETA-friendly interpretation is treating the slumbering animal cargo like a buffet.) Winstones heavy is less goofy at least than the rock-encrusted fallen angels beating back his forces. These talking special effects which helpfully assist Noah in putting together his boat seem like refugees from Peter Jacksons Middle-earth. Theres little reconciling such fantasy-flick elements with the grounded character drama Aronofsky otherwise offers. Noah like its namesake is simply burdened by competing impulses. At its best the film gets by on its striking imagery from a panorama of sickening human decadence to a mid-movie retelling of the creation story that might make Terrence Malick weep. If theres a correlative in Aronofskys filmography its clearly the beautiful folly of The Fountain another flawed but ambitious attempt to ask big spiritual questions in a fantastical context. But that project was borderline avant-garde in its architecture beholden less to plot than to the directors gushing big feels. Noah by contrast is anchored to its earthly melodrama which reaches a fever pitch of lunacy once the family takes to the raging seas. Convinced of his responsibility to purge the planet of humanity Crowes raving patriarch threatens the unborn child of his son (Douglas Booth) and adopted daughter (Emma Watson) while the most vengeful of his offspring (Logan Lerman) schemes with a stowaway. Devoid of wonder these scenes seem to drag on for 40 days and 40 nights. Aronofsky may have bested his Hollywood overlords but it would take a blind faith in his talent to see this bloated sometimes fascinating passion project as nothing but a godsend.

Grade C- Anyone who loves the story of Noahs Ark for its heroic optimism and its reconciliation between man and God - abandon all hope ye who enter ""Noah."" Director Darren Aronofsky views the tale as an epilogue to Adam and Eves ejection from Paradise. He doesnt stop harping on the fall of man even after the ark crashes into a mountaintop. The filmmaker crams in every reaction he ever had to the book of Genesis. He delivers the creation not just once but twice. The movie is as loud and emphatic as it is stuffed. But Aronofsky cant get any resonant meaning or emotion out of any of it. The result is so brash its sure to be called exciting or at least not boring. Those not in the directors camp may find it pummeling or numbing. He huffs and he puffs but fails to blow you away. Noahs ark becomes Aronofskys soapbox in this dour accusatory spectacle. He aims to create shock and awe with a biblical world as stark and retro-futuristic as a post-nuclear apocalypse. His visual jeremiads are as easy to read as the illustrated pamphlets at a childrens service Man is bad; the creators world was good. At one point Noah even uses those PSA words ""clean and unspoiled"" to describe the earth before man stripped it of beauty and worth. Everything in this film is hyperbolic and stylized; everything can be understood instantly. Yet the film is also muddled and lumpy as drama and narrative. It builds to a triple climax thats hysterical in every sense of the word. Noah gets his messages from ""the creator"" (this films word for God) in macabre visions. But most of Aronofskys scenes are square and conventional morally and aesthetically including the storys greatest set piece the animals march into the ark. The Noahs ark sequence in John Hustons ""The Bible"" contains more genuine moviemaking energy with its melding of human and animal actors than there is in Aronofskys CGI menageries. The animals in ""Noah"" simply swarm into the Ark in murky hordes then sleep for the duration of their journey. Noah talks a lot about being kind to animals. A vegetarian himself he mocks meat eaters as ignorant barbarians who ""forget strength comes from the creator."" But this movie treats its animals as an afterthought. Right from the start Aronofsky makes it dark-crystal clear that carnivorous men searching for quick wealth and easy pickings have exhausted the earth of its flora and fauna. In the first scene the warrior king Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) - a descendant of just plain Cain - bashes in the skull of Noahs father. Next we see Noah as a grown man with sons of his own happily foraging for herbs. Hes teaching them the sound ecological principle to gather only what they need when starving hunters chase a wounded dog onto their path. (Its a sci-fi dog with armadillo-like armor.) Remember the National Lampoon cover that insisted ""If You Dont Buy This Magazine Well Kill This Dog""? This movie is just as determined for you to buy its environmental and vegetarian attitudes and it kills the dog anyway. The only transcendent creatures are ""the Watchers"" a group of one-time angels. (Theyre benign versions of the fallen angels also known as Watchers in the non-canonical book of Enoch.) They plummeted from heaven to protect the poor humans after they were tossed from Eden. To punish the rebel angels the creator trapped their golden forms in molten rock and mud. They sport six craggy arms instead of a half-dozen wings. Theyre lopsided and grotesque; not even the two sides of their faces match up neatly. But they are actually more touching and arresting in an ugly-handsome sort of way than their former seraphic selves. Frank Langella Nick Nolte and Mark Margolis give peak vocal performances as the chief Watchers. They inflect gravelly tones in fierce and affecting ways. The movie is the real six-armed monster - and on the whole it lacks the Watchers charm. The first arm is the skeleton of the traditional story with Noah (Russell Crowe) his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) their three sons and the Watchers scrambling to put together the ark before the creators flood cleanses the earth. The second is a pedestrian depiction of antediluvian savages. The third is a banal environmental fable about men strip-mining the earth for the precious resource ""tzohar"" which glitters like gold ignites like kindling and has magical powers. The fourth is anti-carnivore propaganda. The fifth is dysfunctional soap opera - in Aronofskys script Noahs sons dont have wives and the one candidate the clans comely ward Ila (Emma Watson) is thought to be barren. The sixth is overheated psychodrama with Noah as a bullying patriarch and a victim of survivors guilt as well as PTSD. Those who wish for a playful avuncular Noah must turn instead to Noahs granddad Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) at least before the flood. It would be thrilling to report that Aronofsky had gathered these strands into a gorgeous tapestry. Instead its a tangle of loose threads. Nothing makes dramatic sense or has emotional follow-through. Noah survives the trauma of seeing his father killed by Tubal-cain. Decades later as a seasoned hardy man he witnesses a panorama of degradation in Tubal-cains camp and envisions himself as part of it. He decides that the creator wants him to save wildlife and let man become extinct. Not even long-suffering Naameh can swallow that interpretation. Their eldest and middle sons Shem (Douglas Booth) and Ham (Logan Lerman) go Iron Age ballistic. So will much of the audience. Aronofsky fails to make Noahs error profound or credible. It registers neither as a critique of leaders who are sure of ""Gods plans"" nor the tragic flaw of a heroic character. Its merely an egregious plot turn. ""Noah"" becomes a story of a hero who misreads divine intentions and almost makes his family pay the price. Hes like an existential Wrong Way Corrigan; youre amazed that the ark gets anywhere. In a frenzy of crosscutting Noahs depressive paranoia and his familys resentment and hatred come to a head along with the remnants of Cains murderous legacy. And then - well can you call something deus ex machina if the deus really is the Deus? I say hell yes. Crowes performance is intense in the attention-getting manner that sometimes wins Oscars. Aronofskys filmmaking works you over the same way with the kind of coarse ""excitement"" that can easily be mistaken for virtuosity - hyped sound contrasted with sudden quiet; stark close-ups leading to scenic nightmares. His one splendid visual coup is the image of water spouting up from the earth to meet the rain pouring down from the sky and thats straight out of Scripture. You can find almost all of the films ""inventions"" including the notion that murder was rampant before the flood in Robert Alters superb translation of Genesis. Alter makes clear that the creator did not prescribe a vegetarian diet. God tells Noah and his sons ""And the dread and fear of you shall be upon all the beasts of the fields and all the fowl of the heavens in all that crawls on the ground and in all the fish of the sea. ... All stirring things that are alive yours shall be for food like the green plants I have given all to you."" Its a better menu than anything in ""Noah."" Better written too.

"Review Energetic Noah goes overboard -- to riveting effect - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Energetic Noah goes overboard -- to riveting effect Noah Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Noah starring Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly Douglas Booth Logan Lerman and Emma Watson. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Noah starring Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly Douglas Booth Logan Lerman and Emma Watson. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Its not only biblical prophets who have visions movie directors have them too. And when a filmmaker like Darren Aronofsky bring his very personal perspective to the ancient story of Noah and the flood moviegoers will have to hang on tight to avoid getting washed overboard.Grandiose improbable outlandish and overwrought ""Noah"" is the kind of simultaneously preposterous and dead serious movie that has become Aronofskys specialty. As much a fantasia inspired by the Old Testament as a literal retelling of that tale ""Noah"" manages to blend the expected with the unexpected and does it with so much gusto and cinematic energy you wont want to divert your eyes from the screen. Aronofskys previous films including commercial successes ""Black Swan"" and ""The Wrestler"" are united by their weakness for all kinds of excess. This too-much-is-not-enough tendency has not gone away but feels more suited to the material on display. If youre going to treat every little thing like its the end of the world having the real end of the world to deal with can only be a plus.VIDEO Kenneth Turan reviews Noah On the expected side of the ledger are impressive computer-generated marvels like the worlds creatures showing up in the inevitable two by two (no animals were harmed because none were used) and a 5000 gallons per minute rain scene to end all rain scenes. (This was The Flood after all.) And production designer Mark Friedberg got to build a big chunk of an imposing 75-foot-high 45-foot-wide 450-foot-long ark described in the press notes as ""hewing to the most authentic measurements.""This is what moviegoers thought theyd be getting but there is more going on here a whole lot more. Aronofskys ""Noah"" includes not-so-covert messages about despoiling the planet a bemused Anthony Hopkins as oldest-man-ever Methuselah an unlooked-for villain played by Ray Winstone plus romantic Sturm und Drang about finding appropriate wives for Noahs three sons. And dont forget the Watchers a bunch of giants who look and act like Stone Age Transformers but are apparently fallen angels marooned on Earth (dont ask.) This is one busy movie.And then there is the nature of Noah himself. Always a fiercely masculine presence Russell Crowe plays the patriarch as the ultimate task-oriented guy chosen for this mission because he can be depended on for whatever it takes to do the almightys will. But when he has a hard time figuring out exactly what that will is Noah also provides the film with some unexpected if inevitably overwrought emotional cliffhanger moments.PHOTOS 10 controversial films based on religion Working with co-screenwriter and frequent collaborator Ari Handel Aronofsky has delved deeply into the bottomless world of biblical legend apocrypha like the Book of Enoch and midrashic commentary to fill in the blanks in the flooded ones spare story. If you dont remember dialogue like ""What are you doing Noah?"" or environmentalist sentiments on the order of ""we broke the world we deserved this"" from your Sunday school class you are not alone.Yet ""Noah"" perhaps mindful of the box office power of religious believers couldnt be more respectful even reverential to the traditional idea of what Noah calls ""the creator"" who brought the world into being and very much continues to call all the shots.It is not however a world where people are very happy. A blight of wickedness has fallen on this blighted land (the film was shot in bleakest Iceland) and roving hordes of marauders -- more reminiscent of Cormac McCarthys ""The Road"" than anything biblical -- pillage at will. Only the descendants of Seth Adam and Eves third son care enough about civilization to attempt to protect it.PHOTOS Stars who turned down or were turned down for ultimately famous rolesAfter a brief prologue we are introduced to the adult Noah a vegetarian descendant of Seth presented as perhaps the worlds first locavore advising his two young sons that ""we take only what we need what we can use"" and cherishing his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly). When the man comes across a severely wounded young girl whose family has been massacred its only natural that he takes her in.Noah however is troubled by recurring dreams involving yes water. After consulting with Methuselah he has to face facts The creator is going to destroy the world blotting out all human life. After another dream he knows his task is to build an ark which assisted by those Watchers (voices include Nick Nolte and Frank Langella) is what he sets out to do.Cut to 10 years later (hey building an ark takes time). Noah has a new son named Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll) and that young girl has grown into the comely Ila (Emma Watson). Though barren because of her wound shes caught the eye of oldest son Shem (Douglas Booth) which leaves next son Ham (Logan Lerman) feeling left out. BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenNoah however has more pressing problems. Villainous local ruler Tubal-cain (Winstone) has heard about the ark (news travels slowly but it travels) and shows up with his pagan hordes demanding to be taken on board when the time comes. Noah puts the kibosh on that idea but you dont have to be as wise as Methuselah to predict that this question will be revisited and violently once the rains begin. As ""Noahs"" hectic plot wends its biblical way you have to respect this films colossal nerve even if you can rarely take its situations as seriously as creator Aronofsky does. With its determination to tell this traditional story in its own way it begins to oddly echo the very different but equally individualistic Old Testament epics put out by the old master himself Cecil B. DeMille. The creator really does work in mysterious ways.kenneth.turanlatimes.com ---------------------------NoahMPAA rating PG-13 for violence disturbing images and brief suggestive contentRunning time 2 hours 17 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Darren Aronofsky Noah (movie) Reviews Ray Winstone Black Swan Religious movies at the box office For his hot-button Noah Darren Aronofsky gave ark builder an arc Noah Russell Crowe Darren Aronofsky meet Pope Francis Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-noah-review-20140328,0,1626920.story#axzz2xBS7kiPw",200,noah22,noah,latimes
"Aronofskys Noah is everything _ except boring | The Big Story Skip to main content Latest News The Conversation Aronofskys Noah is everything _ except boring By JOCELYN NOVECK Mar. 27 2014 811 PM EDT What to make of Darren Aronofskys ""Noah""? Perhaps thats the wrong question. Indeed what NOT to make of ""Noah""? Because it is so many things.It is of course a biblical blockbuster a 21st-century answer to Cecil B. DeMille. Its also a disaster movie -- the original disaster you might say. Its an intense family drama. Part sci-fi film. An action flick? Definitely along the lines of ""The Lord of the Rings."" At times you might also think of ""Transformers"" and at one point even ""The Shining.""But theres one thing ""Noah"" is not for a moment Dull. So what to make of ""Noah""? Its a movie that with all its occasional excess is utterly worth your time -- 138 minutes of it.Although the real star of the film is its visual ingenuity particularly in a few stunning sequences one must give ample credit to Russell Crowe who lends Noah the moral heft and groundedness we need to believe everything that ends up happening to him. Noahs near-descent into madness would not be nearly as effective had Crowe not already convinced us of his essential decency. At the same time the actor is believable when pondering the most heinous crime imaginable. Its one of Crowes more effective performances.It wouldnt have been possible though without considerable liberties taken by Aronofsky and his co-screenwriter Ari Handel in framing Noahs story. Theres been controversy here but if you glance at the Bible youll see why liberties are necessary the story takes up only a few passages hardly enough for a feature-length script.And yet its one of the best-known tales in the Bible if most of us only remember the childrens version with visions of brightly painted animals standing two-by-two on the ark. But theres a much more serious backdrop Mans wickedness and Gods desire to purge the earth of that wickedness. Aronofsky dives headlong into this story of good vs. evil not only between men but within one mans soul.We meet Noah and his family as theyre attempting to live peacefully off the land and ward off the greedy violent descendants of Cain. Noah has three sons and a wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly genuine and appealing). Along the way they pick up Ila an injured young girl who will grow to love Noahs son Shem (an invented character played with sensitivity by Emma Watson.)Noah visits his grandfather Methuselah embodied with scene-stealing vigor by Anthony Hopkins. The old man -- and by the way this is relative because Noah himself is already over 500 years old according to the Bible -- helps him induce a hallucination which brings a vision. The Creator will destroy the Earth in a great flood. Noahs job of course is to build that great ark and get out of Dixie.Its a monumental task but Noah has help the Watchers huge lumbering creatures made of rock who for Aronofsky represent the biblical Nephilim. Are they angels giants or men? Interpretation varies.But it is here that the movie courts ridicule. These creatures look a little too much like Transformers and detract from the mystical feel of the film. A giggle is surely not what the director was going for here but he may get a few.But that ark? Its a wondrous thing -- constructed on a Long Island field according to measurements specified in Genesis and finished up digitally.Also stunning the flood itself more chilling than any youve seen in a disaster flick. Its also rather magical to watch the animals arrive two by two (and by virtue of CGI) at the ark.But for sheer cinematic beauty its hard to beat the dreamlike sequence in which Aronofsky illustrates the story of creation as recounted by Noah. At this moment you may well forgive any excesses in the film. Like his flawed hero Aronofsky has a vision -- a cinematic one -- and the results if not perfect are pretty darned compelling.___""Noah"" a Paramount Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""violence disturbing images and brief suggestive content.""

(Niko Tavernise) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 27 2014 524 PM Title Noah Film Info With Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly Emma Watson. An epic of biblical proportions. Director Darren Aronofsky (217). PG-13 Violence disturbing images. Area theaters. A biblical movie needs more than faith. But ""Noah"" Darren Aronofskys often ludicrous occasionally thoughtful epic puts theology front-and-center and doubles down on its blockbuster ingredients -- like adding huge rock monsters with glowing eyes (more on them later). But Aronofskys film is most powerful when its title character rages and suffers through what seems to be a suicide mission. Those scenes keep this ambitious Old Testament epic from being a washout. The movie starts with an odd five-minute animated prologue recapping the tale of Adam and Eve; their sons Cain Abel and Seth; and Cains murder of Abel. Much of the film blends Bible verse with several script additions done with good intentions. The descendants of Cain per the Bible are vicious while Seths are virtuous. Of course Noah (Russell Crowe) is in Seths bloodline. Russell Crowe as Noah with Jennifer Connelly as his wife Naameh (Niko Tavernise) Ila (Emma Watson) and Shem (Douglas Booth) endure the storm in ""Noah."" (Niko Tavernise) Shem (Douglas Booth) falls in love with Ila (Emma Watson) in ""Noah."" (Niko Tavernise) Russell Crowe gets to work as Noah. (Niko Tavernise) From left Leo McHugh Carroll as Japheth Jennifer Connelly as Naameh Douglas Booth as Shem and Emma Watson as Ila in ""Noah."" (Niko Tavernise) After having visions of an apocalyptic flood and the preservation of the worlds animals Noah confers with his grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) the oldest living man and decides to move his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and sons Shem Ham and Japheth to higher ground. Along the way they find a wounded girl named Ila (one of the unnamed ""wives"" the Bible alludes to). Settling at the outskirts of a violence-filled village Noah builds an ark here aided by ""Watchers"" -- fallen angels trapped inside giant stone clusters. (In the Bible these are Nephilim). Russell Crowe is Noah in Darren Aronofskys biblical blockbuster. (Niko Tavernise) As the ark is built teenage Shem (Douglas Booth) falls in love with Ila (Emma Watson) as mateless Ham (Logan Lerman) seethes becoming a typical Hollywood-style bad seed. Then as we know two of every creature arrive from around the globe. (Aronofskys film wisely provides Noah with a smoky fume that works like biblical Benadryl to put the animals to sleep even before the first raindrop falls.) When the water does come Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) brutal king of Cains descendants wants a spot on the ark (hes mentioned in Genesis but here is upgraded to villain). Yet Noah has watched the children of Cain ruin the land -- the film adds that theyre also hunting beasts to extinction -- so theyre left to die. Before the rains stop and the ark lands at Mount Ararat a tortured Noah aims to sacrifice Shem and Ilas unborn child -- in Aronofskys script Noah believes humans should not be saved. That dark new take on the story -- and Crowes intense good often scary performance -- keeps ""Noah"" afloat despite clunky moments such as the ""Waterworld""-like duds the mega-rock angels (voiced mainly by Nick Nolte and Frank Langella) and scenes of a stowaway villain hiding between the emu and the weasels. The flood of faith is another matter. The film constantly refers to ""the Creator"" and is from the beginning clearly a religious work. It doesnt need to push. Multiple recitations from the Book of Genesis seem like overkill. The dialogue that does resonate is actually when Aronofsky through Crowe appears to be chewing on Big Ideas and wrestling with exactly what Noahs story means. In this iteration Noah sometimes thinks globally but acts brutally. At those times the movie feels more a conversation between a filmmaker and his audience and less like a sermon. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" Thurs. - Sun. throughout the day on New Yorks WOR-710 AM and at wor710.com.

Photo Credit Paramount Pictures / Niko Tavernise advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In the days before an apocalyptic flood a family builds an ark to save Gods creatures. Rated PG-13 BOTTOM LINE Not for all tastes or faiths but this biblical epic works as both big-screen Hollywood entertainment and serious scriptural interpretation. CAST Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly Emma Watson LENGTH 218 Warning The biblical epic ""Noah"" contains Darwinian imagery environmentalist rhetoric and a deeply unflattering portrayal of the Old Testament prophet. Viewer discretion especially among religious conservatives is advised. Then again the movie that writer-director Darren Aronofsky (""Black Swan"") has described as ""the least biblical biblical film ever made"" yet also one ""respecting everything in the Bible"" delivers on both counts. Starring Russell Crowe as Gods chosen ark-builder and featuring a cast of CGI-generated thousands ""Noah"" is part Tolkien-esque fantasy part comic-book pulp and part scriptural exegesis. That heady blend wont please everybody but ""Noah"" is a daringly inventive thoroughly entertaining and ultimately very serious movie. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The pre-release controversy over Aronofskys version of a sacred text has been so great that Paramount Pictures added a real disclaimer to its trailers warning moviegoers that ""artistic license has been taken."" Thats an understatement. ""Noah"" unfolds in a magical lushly-colored realm -- shooting locales included Iceland and more prosaically Oyster Bay -- populated by semi-mythical beasts and giant rock-creatures called Watchers (listen for the gravelly voice of Nick Nolte). Proving further that this is not your grandfathers ""Noah"" Anthony Hopkins plays Noahs grandfather Methuselah as a hallucinogen-sipping shaman. ""Noah"" began as a graphic novel by Aronofsky and co-screenwriter Ari Handel and the movies first half often looks and sounds like one. (The crisp ""chomp"" from Eves apple nearly floats in a dialogue balloon.) As the flood nears however darker and more complex currents emerge. A ruthless warlord Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone) vies for the loyalty of Noahs son Ham (Logan Lerman) and Noah himself begins drifting toward madness. His adopted daughter Ila (Emma Watson) will test Noahs faith in a way that recalls another dark chapter in the Bible that of Abraham and Isaac. Jennifer Connelly as Noahs wife Naameh provides the voice of reason and mercy. 226 MoviesFilmed on LI Russell Crowes Noah Weve come a long way since ""The Ten Commandments"" -- or have we? In some ways ""Noah"" is thoroughly Hollywood. Crowe is as strong-jawed and patriarchal as Charlton Hestons Moses and the movie is filled with scenes of spectacular disaster raging battles and blinding light from heaven. Some may suspect it of pushing an agenda or meddling where it shouldnt but ""Noah"" works precisely because it takes so many risks. It isnt preaching to or against any choir. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT In the days before an apocalyptic flood a family builds an ark to save Gods creatures.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 7 p.m. EDT March 27 2014Its a bold re-telling of the Bible story with plenty of spectacle thats undercut by its own ambitions.Russell Crowe plays the titular hero in Noah director Darren Aronofskys take on the biblical tale.(Photo Niko Tavernise Paramount Pictures)Noah is no by-the-book Bible story. Think of it as a visually mesmerizing sci-fi adventure saga loosely based on the book of Genesis.Where it does adhere to its source material is in its 139-minute length About halfway in it starts to feel as though its been going on for 40 days and 40 nights.Along the way however Noah ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide) offers plenty of visual splendor. A vividly stirring time-lapse montage of the creation story is marked by stunning and original computer-generated imagery.The world surrounding Noah (Russell Crowe) is hollow and desolate. The landscape looks post-apocalyptic though the real apocalypse -- a great flood and its annihilation -- looms. Those descended from Cain driven by greed and hedonism have brought about the destruction. Noah has a vision in which he is chosen by God (referred to throughout only as ""the Creator) to survive a catastrophic flood and protect the innocent beasts of the world.STORY Noah hits rough religious waters on-screenMORE Hollywood finds religion and profits at theatersREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersDirector Darren Aronofsky is known for his inventive filmmaking. While his re-envisioning of Scripture is certainly not stodgy or bound by sacred text its not as audacious as he seeks to make it.A revisionist version of the well-known tale is not problematic in itself. And the cautionary environmentalist message is an intriguing perspective on a story that involves saving animals from extinction. What trips up the film is the addition of a reductive subplot where a power-mad marauder named Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone) menaces Noah and his family. Noah had a rough enough road without Aronofsky shoehorning the scheming Tubal-Cain into the mix. As a dramatic device its more appropriate for a superhero movie than a biblical epic. Worse the villain spouts cliched evil-speak such as ""Kill the giants. Kill Noah. Take the ark.""Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Russell Crowe plays the titular lead in Darren Aronofskys re-imagining of the classic Biblical tale. VPCCrowe does a credible job playing the brooding single-minded Noah. He is a man obsessed often to the detriment of his family. He and his wife Naameh(Jennifer Connelly) devise a method to sedate the animals so they can live within confined quarters in relative harmony. After they arrive and board the ark however the animals play a mystifyingly small part in Aronofskys vision.To build his vessel the beleaguered Noah enlists the aid of stone-encrusted giants -- a version of fallen angels known as Watchers voiced by Frank Langella Nick Nolte and Mark Margolis. The rock creatures give the film the distinctive feel of a fantasy adventure.The ancient-but-ageless Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) pops up to help out in mystical ways. Hes Noahs grandfather and lives in a cave nearby but rarely visits. What he is most focused on is berries. While Noah can think of nothing but building his ark Methuselahs berry craving forms the arc of his character.Noah and Naameh have three sons Ham (Logan Lerman) Shem (Douglas Booth) and Japheth (Leo Carroll) whose stories add little to the saga. They adopt Ila an abandoned and wounded baby (played as an adult by Emma Watson) who grows into a preternaturally wise if ever-worried character.Noah laments ""We broke the world"" as he struggles to right the wrongs of his fellow man. But the film grows overheated as hes driven to drink and insanity feeling hes failed in his mission.Aronofsky seems drawn to stories of obsessed individuals driven to madness such as the intense mathematician in Pi and the deranged ballerina in Black Swan.A massively scaled undertaking Noah is a bold re-telling with plenty of spectacle undercut by its own sprawling ambitions fantasy elements and formulaic villain. 348 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 30 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1mx3l6v",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/03/27/noah-review/5809081/,200,noah26,noah,usatoday

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 822 a.m. MST March 28 2014Darren Aronofsky isnt afraid to stray from scripture in his telling of the story of the great flood and the man (Russell Crowe) who built an ark to survive it. And for the most part it works.This image released by Paramount Pictures shows Jennifer Connelly left and Russell Crowe in a scene from ""Noah.""(Photo Niko Tavernise/AP)Story HighlightsA bulked-up Crowe plays Noah with both compassion and menace.The story deviates in key places from the Biblical telling.The overall effect however is a story of faith and devotion.I thought you were good. I thought thats why he chose you.""So says one of Noahs sons to his father who is unwavering in his faith and devotion to the point of murder if it comes to that.Noahs reply ""He chose me because he knew I would finish the job nothing more.""Those words set the tone in Darren Aronofskys sprawling compelling ""Noah."" Noah played by a bulked-up Russell Crowe in this telling is a man with a massive job to do. Is it a literal interpretation of the biblical story? No. Nor does it have to be. We see through the course of the film what blind devotion brings upon someone and the importance of forgiveness and love in the equation.Sounds like the kind of thing a person of faith might find valuable. Yet many Christian (and Muslim) groups have denounced the film. My advice See it first; then decide whether its worthy. Youre likely to find that it is.Nothing if not ambitious Aronofsky begins the film with a quick run-through of the creation through Adam and Eve and the forbidden fruit and Cain and Abel. The visuals are saturated with color giving it a sort of overheated dreamlike feel. Now 10 generations after the Garden of Eden Noah and his family live in a barren wilderness rife with savages who roam the countryside killing and eating animals (something Noah forbids his family to do) and killing the occasional person while theyre at it.In a dream Noah sees the earth destroyed by water so he surmises that the creator -- the word ""God"" is never mentioned in the film but so worshipful is Noah that it hardly matters -- is going to flood the world and destroy all life upon it. He also intuits that he is to build an ark to house all the beasts of the field birds of the sky etc.This you probably know. Most civilizations including those that predate the writing of the Bible have a flood story. Here the wicked humans are the survivors of Cain so they are murderous having turned against the creator. Noah and his family are descendants of Seth another son of Adam and Eve. Thus they are chosen to survive and start anew. Interview Emma Watson more spiritual than religiousOr so we think.Noah enlists the help of rock giants that are essentially fallen angels and yes they look like rock giants from a ""Hobbit"" movie or something. But without them the building of the massive ark just by Noah and his sons would be impossible. They also aid in keeping the savages led by Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) at bay. Tubal-cain believes man is superior to animals so he wants to kill Noah and his family and take the animals along as more or less an all-you-can-eat buffet.Again Aronofsky dives into territory that isnt strictly scripture-based. There is also the matter of how Noahs family will repopulate the earth. They have adopted Ila (Emma Watson) who becomes the wife of Shem (Douglas Booth). But an injury has left her barren and Ham (Logan Lerman) and Japeth (Leo McHugh Carroll) are without any prospects given that humanity is about to be destroyed.Dont worry Noah says in what is a familiar refrain Has the creator not always given us what we need?Again this is faith-based thought based on trust. Where things go a little haywire is when Noah visits Tubal-cains village which has descended into a free-for-all of murderous mayhem. He was looking for potential wives for his other sons but leaves disgusted with all of mankind including himself.This is the end he decides. His family will protect the animals see that theyre delivered safely to land and then live out their days until they and all of humanity die. Noah becomes obsessed with this idea to the point of potentially doing his family harm. And yet although this deviates greatly from the popular conception of Noah it also allows room for forgiveness and redemption.Some of the CGI effects come off a little cheesy (there are an awful lot of animals of all kinds to be loaded on-board after all) but much of the film is visually stunning with creative takes on such familiar themes as violence begetting violence.Taken strictly as a piece of filmmaking Aranofskys ""Noah"" is ambitious. And as theology well it may not hew exactly to the letter of the law but the spirit survives intact. 5 essential Russell Crowe moviesNoahDirector Darren Aronofsky.Cast Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly Anthony Hopkins.Rating PG-13 for violence disturbing images and brief suggestive content. 17 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1jS0yAf More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

A man is chosen by God to undertake a momentous mission of rescue before an apocalyptic flood destroys the world. Starring Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly Emma Watson and Anthony Hopkins. (Photo/Video Paramount) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated March 27 2014 811 p.m. ET In the beginning even before a brisk recap of the Creation Darren Aronofskys ""Noah"" fills the screen with a disclaimer noting that ""artistic license has been taken."" It certainly has. This is a daring venture in mainstream entertainment and mostly an enthralling one despite some problematic patches. The film is revisionist to be sure; weve never seen a Noah like the hero played so fiercely by Russell Crowe. But its visionist as well an action spectacular with a provocative vision--the story of Noahs ark as a vessel for lots more than animal husbandry in the face of apocalypse. Ferocity is the last quality one would ascribe to previous Noahs on the screen. Until now the watchword has been earnestness and the dominant portrait has remained John Hustons performance in a movie he directed almost half a century ago--""The Bible In the Beginning."" Mr. Hustons Noah was a good man but something of a simpleton and a bit of a clown with a cockeyed smile and a Popeye squint. (Pauline Kael called the movie agnostic.) As soon as Noah got his orders from the Lord he set to work no questions asked and built a sort of McHouseboat--big for an ark but hardly big enough for all the animals filing aboard in a cheerful processional that could have set the stage for ""Doctor Dolittle."" The current Noah doesnt smile easily. A wary survivor in a cruel sere land he protects his wife and sons as best he can from the perils of a world that has fallen into chaos since the Fall of Man. Commanded to build an ark he rises to the challenge. (The film comes up with a beautifully inventive source of lumber and provides heavy-lifting labor in the form of Watchers about whom more unfortunately will be said below.) And hes fine with the passenger list as far as it goes. Innocent animals two by two? This Noah as written by Mr. Aronofsky and Ari Handel accepts their innocence and welcomes them aboard. When it comes to humanity though--to the hordes of desperate humans struggling to save themselves from the flood in a sequence suggestive of Hieronymus Bosch--Noah draws the line and ruthlessly. Saving the innocent means only the animals ""Men are going to be punished for what theyve done to this world."" Related Reading Religious Groups Split on Noah Film Ark-itectural Digest Special Effects for Noah Photos Creating the Ark and Animals in Noah Was Dune a Film Better Off Unmade? Photos Scenes From Jodorowskys Dune A good man at heart Noah has been maddened into misanthropy by the evil he has seen in his fellow man. He is in unminced words and Mr. Crowes adamantine presence a zealot a strict constructionist quite literally a creationist who wont swerve from what he believes hes been told. The movie may well be punished in some quarters for the darkness of this concept; it has already been ridiculed by Glenn Beck as ""pro-animal"" and ""strongly antihuman."" The first comment is right on the money. This Noah is a deep-dyed conservationist as any Noah would have to be when confronted by a mass extinction that hes been chosen to prevent. But antihuman? Thats a reductionist reading of a film willing and able to dramatize--with irony-free urgency--questions of good and evil that are fundamental to religious thought. ENLARGE Russell Crowe is Noah and Ray Winstone is Tubal-cain in Noah Paramount Pictures The personification of evil in this extravagant morality play is Tubal-cain a descendant of Cain mankinds first murderer. Although he is mentioned in the Book of Genesis his presence here is one of many inventions that come under the artistic-license rubric. As portrayed by Ray Winstone Tubal-cain is fully equal to the role of Noahs nemesis; he looms much larger and longer than one might suppose from whats already known of the plot. In fact the antagonism between the two men plays out with such intensity that our sympathy starts to shift at one point--from Noah who seems to be a permanent prisoner of his own rage to Tubal-cain who still believes in God but feels abandoned by Him. It shifts back though. However pitiless Noah has become he remains a soul in progress and the film gambles on its star being able to preserve the heros humanity without softening his fury. In doing just that Mr. Crowe achieves something close to an acting miracle. If only the special-effects people had followed suit. We often take for granted the modern miracles of digital technology but the Watchers giant apparitions built of bits and bytes are dangerously gigglesome. As conceived they are fanciful versions of fallen angels the Nephilim mentioned glancingly in the Bible. As depicted they are anguishingly misshapen creatures with basso voices trapped in stony shells and--though you do keep watching them--a folly of considerable proportions since they look like refugees from some hoary horror film. Getting this production on the screen must have been a monumentally difficult enterprise if only for the schism between its indie spirit and studio budget and it shows--in occasional narrative disconnections uncertain humor (Anthony Hopkins as Methuselah obsessed with foraging for berries) and moments of inaudible dialogue. Yet ""Noah"" combines audacity intelligence and spectacle in ways that often do seem monumental. (The cinematographer was Matthew Libatique. The production designer was Mark Friedberg. Michael Wilkinson designed the ancient-chic costumes. Clint Mansell composed the music.) Jennifer Connelly is superb as Noahs wife whos called Naameh though she is nameless in the Bible; Naameh believes man is good and Ms. Connelly makes an impassioned case for her belief. Logan Lerman and Douglas Booth both of them young and handsome are respectively Noahs sons Ham and Shem. Emma Watson is poignantly appealing as Ila an orphan adopted by Noah who plays a pivotal role in momentous family battles that come to a crescendo on the ark. I saw the film on a conventional screen--that is to say on a big one but not in the IMAX format many theaters will be offering. All the same the imagery was sumptuous Cain killing Abel in silhouette; a flower blooming unbidden from the desert floor; Noahs nightmares of drowning; his visions of submergence in oceans swirling with life; the vast squarish ark turned into a vertiginous zoo (wait till you see how all those animals are cared for) and of course the climactic voyage on the highest of high seas. ""Noah"" can be silly or sublime but its never less than fascinating. I was on board from start to finish. Corrections amp; Amplifications A disclaimer that accompanied a preview screening of ""Noah"" will not be included in the general-release version of the film. Watch a clip from the documentary film ""Jodorowskys Dune."" The story of cult film director Alejandro Jodorowskys ambitious but ultimately doomed film adaptation of the seminal science fiction novel. (Photo/Video Sony Pictures Classics) Jodorowskys Dune Unlike ""Noah"" a visionary movie that got made Alejandro Jodorowskys ""Dune"" the subject of Frank Pavichs exhilarating documentary is a visionary movie that didnt get made yet had a demonstrable impact on many others that did. (Although a turgid adaptation was eventually brought to the big screen by David Lynch no one has ever accused it of being visionary.) ""Dune"" the novel is the late Frank Herberts masterpiece a sci-fi epic published in 1965. Mr. Jodorowsky is the Chilean director who arguably invented the midnight movie with two features that have become cult classics ""El Topo"" and ""The Holy Mountain."" This documentary recounts the herculean efforts expended by Mr. Jodorowsky on behalf of a film that was meant to be as its creator puts it ""something sacred."" But how can he be called its creator if it never became a reality? Thats easy. Over the course of two years in the 1970s Mr. Jodorowsky and his so-called warriors--a team of brilliantly talented colleagues hed assembled--produced thousands of vivid storyboards scores of gorgeous costume designs and a plethora of stunning paintings as well as a shooting script. The fruits of their labors brought together in a massive book were perfectly real though regrettably not projectable. ENLARGE Artwork by H.R. Giger H.R. Giger/Sony Pictures Classics The unmade movie makes for great stories; serving as his own casting director Mr. Jodorowsky met among others Mick Jagger Orson Welles and Salvador Dali. (Dali agreed to play a mad emperor of the galaxy but only for a fee that would make him the highest-paid actor in the movie business 100000 per minute. The deal was sealed though with a delicious twist.) The made movie--i.e. Mr. Pavichs documentary--makes for a great seminar on creativity. Its star is Mr. Jodorowsky outrageously handsome and dynamic at the age of 84. ""The mind is like a universe"" he declares. ""Its constantly expanding."" As he fixes the camera with a steady gaze you can see the magnetic mystic he must have been. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Master and Commander The Far Side of the World(2003) Russell Crowe is Capt. Jack Aubrey in Peter Weirs epic account of British heroics on the high seas during the Napoleonic Wars. The movie based on the novels by Patrick OBrian didnt do well at the box office and Mr. Crowe didnt help by referring to it as ""Peters 100 million art film."" But see it all the same or see it again. Just as Aubreys authority springs from skill and knowledge so does the films power. They dont make movies like this any more because few people know how to make them. ENLARGE The Wrestler (2008) Darren Aronofsky directing from a script written by Robert D. Siegel turned this story of a washed-up faux-gladiator into a film of authentic beauty and commanding consequence. Mickey Rourke is Randy ""The Ram"" Robinson down and out yet alive and still kicking not to mention flailing grunting twisting and leaping. Mr. Rourke a gifted actor whos had his own massive career problems gives a phenomenal performance that takes pain as a starting point and quickly transcends it. The ultimate subject of ""The Wrestler"" is personal destiny and whether it can be changed. ENLARGE Lost In La Mancha (2002) Another documentary and a good one about another visionary movie that never got made. The documentary was directed by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe. The failed feature shut down after shooting for six chaotic days in Spain was ""The Man Who Killed Don Quixote"" Terry Gilliams take on the classic Cervantes novel. Mr. Gilliam best known as the resident animator of ""Monty Pythons Flying Circus"" wasnt the first filmmaker to be thwarted by Don Quixote; the delusional hero was Orson Welless creative obsession for two decades and Mr. Welles never finished his film either.

And what else would you expect from the man who gave us the creepy-erotic ""Black Swan"" and the scariest drug-trip movie ever ""Requiem for a Dream""? Shock and surprise are his thing. Lightly bound to the traditional telling Aronofsky gives the story massive battle scenes intense family strife and a resonant message about the ecological costs of messing with earthly paradise. In the interests of dramatic conflict and visual spectacle he takes enough liberties to give your Sunday school teacher acid reflux. Aronofsky originates new characters (Ray Winstone as Tubal chief of Cains barbarian offspring) introduces new minerals (a glowing dynamite-like power source called Zohar) and invents categories of semi-divine beings (the Watchers earthbound angels turned into six-armed stone behemoths). We even get a look at a creature that didnt make it off the Ark successfully a deer-like creature with gleaming mahogany-colored scales. Aronofsky digs deeply into the high tension inherent in an end-of-days story. Russell Crowes blacksmith-brawny Noah begins as a peaceful vegetarian recluse instructing his children to take nothing more from the land than they will use. He and his wife here called Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) have withdrawn from the wicked ways of city folk whose dark influence spreads across Aronofskys map of the world like spilled ink. They are a sinful bunch indeed tearing live lambs limb from limb for their supper. Little wonder that Noah quickly accepts the vision that indicates to him that God is preparing to wash his hands of vile humanity. Noah consults with his father Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) and sets out to build a gigantic floating bestiary faithfully doing the Lords work -- even if it means organizing the extinction of his own line when the Ark finds land. Crowe Connelly and Emma Watson as a foundling who grew up with their children to become the bride of their son Shem tearfully consider the proper balance of justice and mercy. Despite their entreaties Noah favors the stern path of child sacrifice rather than re-introducing malignant humanity into the new zoological world order. Paramount Pictures Russell Crowe stars in ""Noah."" Naameh argues that the innocents of the next generation should be protected no matter what. Wise Methuselah shrugs ""How am I to know what is right?"" As rain lashes down from the heavens Tubals rabble attack Noahs fortress-like craft. The battle that ensues lacks the majesty of Peter Jacksons ""Lord of the Rings"" warfare. There are moments of heart-piercing horror however. Noahs moral complexity is never more sharply observed than when he saves his son Ham from Tubals onrushing army but leaves behind the girl he was courting to be crushed underfoot. This is family-first survivalism with a vengeance. Aronofsky introduces a stowaway subplot thats interesting but unnecessary. Crowe radiates plenty of suspenseful hulking menace. Cross this half-mad visionary and its man overboard in a blink. Striding purposefully across the timbered deck a blade in his fist and a deadly gleam in his eye hes reminiscent of the unstoppable unkillable slashers from 80s horror films. Aronofsky is unrelenting in his depiction of big-scale violence too. We see hundreds clinging to a mountaintop screaming in fear as tidal waves smash their bodies and wash them away. The phrase ""the wrath of God"" has rarely been so powerfully visualized. While Aronofsky overstuffs his telling he gets points for fitting in incidents such as Noahs drunkenness in a logical manner. He also has an eye for beauty. The film was shot in primordial Icelandic landscapes and the halo-like rainbows that adorn the finale are a lovely effect. While the filmmakers mind wanders his heart and eye are generally in the right place.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Niko Tavernise) In ""Taxi Driver"" Robert De Niro said ""Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets."" The movie is from 1976 but the impulse to purify a fallen world is as old as Methuselah.For the heathens whove forgotten their Genesis director Darren Aronofsky has summoned ""Noah"" a vivid re-imagining of the biblical flood and its doctrinal currents. Although Aronofsky (""Black Swan"") constructs this vessel with a filmmakers toolbox rather than a theologians blueprint a sturdy hull of human spirit enables it to navigate between both worlds.Noah (Russell Crowe at his most quietly monumental) his wife (Jennifer Connelly) and their three sons inhabit a rocky plateau in a post-Eden world that the Creator seems to have forsaken. While Noah lives in harmony with the harsh environment the descendants of the murderous Cain (led by Ray Winstone) plunder the few resources and feed on the flesh of other creatures. After imbibing sacred herbs with his ancient grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) Noah has a vision of a coming deluge and a mandate from the Creator to build an ark. The colossal ship would ferry all the animals of the earth away from the doomed humans.Its an epic task but if you believe the Bible Noah had more than 100 years to complete it; and if you believe this movie he had help from an army of petrified fallen angels called the Nephilim.Those walking talking stacks of stones are awesome embellishments to a familiar story. Aronofsky also adds some psychedelic seasoning to the seven-day recipe for cooking the cosmos culminating in an evolutionary mash-up that rivals Terrence Malicks marvelous nature sequences in ""The Tree of Life."" Yet ultimately this ""Noah"" focuses on people not plants and animals. While Noah builds the ark the covetous outcasts gather for a nearby bacchanal. Thats where Noahs son Ham (Logan Lerman) meets a misbegotten girl (Madison Davenport) he chooses for his mate just as brother Shem (Douglas Booth) has coupled with orphan Ila (Emma Watson). But Ila is presumably barren and no threat to Noahs vision that the humans on the ark should be the end of their sinful species.Aboard the boat Noah is as tormented as Jesus on the cross but the cargo is an after-thought. Aronofsky jettisons the close-ups of animals boarding the vessel two-by-two just as he skimps on seagoing peril.

Noah (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Noah (PG-13) Darren Aronofskys Biblical epic is a spectacle with substance. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com3/27/2014 Editor rating 3 Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky specializes in movies about people driven to extremes -- by drug addiction (Requiem for a Dream) by the quest for glory (The Wrestler) by madness (Black Swan). In Noah God Himself is the force driving the hero (Russell Crowe) to build an enormous ark big enough to hold two members of every species of animal on the planet. Man has grown evil and greedy and lazy and unworthy and God has decided to reboot leaving only Noah and his family as survivors. When they die so will all of humankind and the innocents will inherit the Earth. This would seem to be odd material for a movie leaving little room for suspense or ingenuity. The Biblical story of the flood is common to many of the worlds religions in one form or another and although God doesnt utter a peep in the film (He communicates with Noah through dreams) the movie could be interpreted as a story of faith as easily as it could be a fairy tale. Throw in some fallen angels (or Nephilim) that have taken the form of giant rock monsters with an unfortunate resemblance to prehistoric Transformers and the movie starts to seem more like a summer blockbuster than a Sunday school lesson. The Passion of the Christ this is not. And yet Aronofsky who co-wrote the screenplay with Ari Handel and is working on his largest canvas to date manages to sneak enough difficult questions about following Gods will blindly and the selfish nature of man to give Noah enough heft to go along with the giant spectacle. As played by Crowe in his kind-brute Gladiator mode Noah is a man who will not question his Masters orders no matter how difficult or illogical they may seem. This doesnt always sit well with his wife (Jennifer Connelly) or son (Logan Lerman) or their adopted daughter (Emma Watson). But Noah like most men possessed by what they believe to be right and true doesnt think or question He simply does as he is told. This is expected for the first half of the movie during the building of the Ark and the amassing of the animals which are spectacularly created by dazzling CGI. But Noahs faith is tested as deeply as Abrahams in the second half of the movie when Aronofsky throws some wrinkles into the story that while not part of any known theology deepen the films exploration of the relationship between God and man and the lengths to which true believers are sometimes forced to go in the name of their deity. Even though everyone knows how the story ends Noah is unexpectedly exciting and emotional and Aronofsky always a great stylist constantly does things with the camera that keep the movie visually entrancing (like giving you a point-of-view shot of the first rain drop falling high from the heavens down onto Noahs face). Will Noah anger some rigid purists and scholars because of the liberties it takes? Perhaps. But the point to take home is the message the movie leaves you with which works regardless of your faith (or lack thereof). Humans are inherently flawed. How we deal with those defects is what truly matters. Cast Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly Emma Watson Ray Winstone Anthony Hopkins Logan Lerman Douglas Booth. Director Darren Aronofsky.

Photo AP/Paramount Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Noah Running time 137 minutes. Rated PG-13 (disturbing images violence). At the Ziegfeld the E-Walk the Beekman others. Holy ship Crowes grumpy Noah and his dysfunctional clan help God reboot the too-wicked world in this imaginative (but hardly sacrilegious) and visually spectacular elaboration on Genesis. While director Darren Aronofsky (""Black Swan) isnt above trying to goose his Scripture with a little PG-13 sex and violence as entertainment this epic ultimately lands roughly midway between Cecil B. DeMilles high-camp ""The Ten Commandments and the high-art provocations of Martin Scorseses ""The Last Temptation of Christ. If that sounds like a somewhat backhanded compliment theres enough good stuff to (barely) justify a three-star rating. You know youre not in Bible school anymore when you get a look at the films most impressive creation a massive three-tiered artisanal wooden ark that resembles a floating barge more than the traditional prowed boats featured in such past Hollywood efforts as ""Noahs Ark (1928) and John Hustons ""The Bible . . . In the Beginning (1966). Emma Watson and Douglas Booth star in ""Noah.""Photo AP/Paramount Pictures Somewhat more dubiously in the Gospel according to Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel (his co-writer on ""The Fountain) the ark is mostly constructed by fallen angels called the Watchers (Nephilim in the Good Book) giant rock creatures who amount to a biblical version of the Transformers (voiced by Frank Langella Nick Nolte and Mark Margolis). Younger audience members will probably appreciate this interpolation since the animals that have figured so prominently in other versions get rather short shrift from Aronofsky -- conjured up entirely on computer screens they all stream quickly onto the ark without Noah s assistance and are sedated with herbs for most of the movie. (Some audience members may feel the same way.) Huston may have provided the voice of God as well as playing the ark builder in ""The Bible but in ""Noah the Almighty is strictly a voice in Russell Crowes head that is never heard by the audience. The stern old survivalist (500 years old when the deluge begins in the Bible but never mind) has a lot more to worry about than the animals. For starters another interpolated Bible character Tubal-Cain (a nasty descendant of you-know-who well-played by Ray Winstone) is leading an army trying to hijack the ark to survive the coming apocalypse. Jennifer Connelly and Russell Crowe star in ""Noah.""Photo AP/Paramount Pictures Ham (Logan Lerman) the middle child of Noahs three sons is pissed off that Pop wont let him take a bride on the ark. And speaking of ham Noahs grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) sets up a climactic crisis by performing what amounts to in vitro fertilization on Ila (Emma Watson) a formerly barren orphan raised by Noah. As she and Noahs eldest son (Douglas Booth whose beard makes him look astonishingly like a Williamsburg hipster) are an item this may imperil what Noah takes as a divine mandate for absolute zero population growth for humans after the flood. Because of awkward pacing these waterlogged dramatic moments sometimes drag to the point where the overlong movie threatens to run for what feels like 40 days and nights. While he doesnt quite measure up to the charm and authority of Charlton Hestons Moses Noah is probably the best performance Crowe has given in recent years -- thankfully he isnt singin in the rain a la ""Les Miserables -- and its nice to see him reteamed with ""Beautiful Mind co-star Jennifer Connelly (who suffers nobly as Noahs wife) in something less cheesy than last months mercifully forgotten ""Winters Tale. The massive torrent of water from above (and from springs below) that wipes out the rest of mankind is worth the price of admission -- at least for connoisseurs of computer-generated images -- though American audiences will apparently have to wait till ""Noah hits Blu-ray to see the deluxe 3-D version being shown in other countries.

The ark built by Russell Crowes Noah couldnt be some SS Minnow-style thing with a cute little peaked-roof house at the top; it had to be a majestically ugly barge approximately the size of three airplane hangars the better to fit thousands of two-by-two CG beasties. Instead of trying to wring some drama out of that hoary old contretemps between Noah and God Aronofsky took a minor Old Testament figure Tubal-cain and hired Ray Winstone to play him. This re-imagined Tubal-cain is a tough who murdered Noahs father long ago; now he wants to elbow his way onto the ark and possibly -- shudder -- eat some of the animals. Also Aronofsky has introduced a group of fallen angels known as the Watchers a race of crabby rock people who have become disgusted with the mess mankind has made and who never got over being defeated by Flash Gordon. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - OK Flash Gordon isnt in the Book of Genesis but that was probably just an oversight. Noah is here not to set the record straight but to set it on its head. This isnt a lavish work of mad genius its a movie designed to be a lavish work of mad genius and theres a difference.Aronofsky is an uncompromising director He wants everything just so and he knows what hes doing to the extent that audiences always do too -- you can feel the gears behind it all noisily grinding. The Wrestler for my money his finest movie at least had a noble battered heart which made his overbearing mannerisms tolerable. But generally theres no spontaneity in an Aronofsky movie and no real sense of risk. If Noah his costliest and splashiest film has any splendor at all its the business-as-usual CGI spectacle kind.Film Details Noah RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time138 More Info Trailer Yet for some reason the seriousness of Aronofskys intent -- he dares to make a biblical film about climate change And about how ugly mankind can be -- and his haute-auteur status are supposed to buoy Noah high above the dross of the average blockbuster superhero movie even though thats exactly what hes made. Crowes Noah is like Christopher Nolans Batman not terrifically likable yet is somehow supposed to inspire our respect. The Creator -- ""God"" is never spoken -- appears to Noah in a dream alerting him in a rather oblique way that Hes about to destroy humankind which has gotten way too evil In the dream blood seeps out of the soil Noah steps on and then his body sinks to the floor of the sea where the corpses of the naughty are piled up like discarded tires. A second dream gives somewhat clearer instruction Noah once again sinks to the depths but this time a bevy of animals rises from the ocean floor and paddles hopefully toward the surface where salvation in the form of that giant flat-bottomed barge awaits.Those dream sequences are the best things in Noah Theres some beauty and not just raw ambition in their poetry. (The cinematographer is Aronofsky regular Matthew Libatique.) But the rest of the time Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel are too busy building their Noah up as an allegedly complex character to recognize what an A-1 Biblical asshole theyve created; Crowe furrowing his brow and declaiming his lines like a Roman senator seems to be enjoying the role a little bit too much.In the beginning Noah seems like a nice enough guy telling his young sons not to pick wildflowers or eat the flesh of animals. He kisses his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly dressed in an assortment of Old Testament-by-way-of Eileen Fisher tunics) tenderly on the lips as a greeting. But in his zeal to follow the Creators mandates he ends up a version of the character played by Terry OQuinn in Joseph Rubens 1987 suburban horror parable The Stepfather When he learns that Emma Watsons Ila the girlfriend of his oldest son Shem (Douglas Booth) has become pregnant Noah vows that if the child is a girl and thus capable of propagating the species she must be killed. In another scene he calmly informs his youngest Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll) that because the boy will be the last human being on the planet to die there will be no one to bury him. Thanks Pop Naameh looks on anxiously yet supportively wondering if her husband has totally lost it but realizing her options are limited since shes trapped on an ark full of stinky animals. Much later -- and be forewarned that a small spoiler is approaching -- Noah realizes the error of his ways and retreats from the family for a time. Upon his return he sidles up to Mrs. Noah and gives her that look the old dudes give their wives in the Cialis commercials so you can presume everything turns out OK.Noahs middle son Ham (Logan Lerman) rebels and as ill-tempered as he is at least his behavior makes sense. But then this is the Old Testament a book of rough justice and as a filmmaker Aronofsky is an Old Testament guy. He wants his audience to blanch to suffer to feel just a little (or perhaps a lot) unworthy -- of his talents of life of everything. Get ready to see animals disemboweled and a young girl trampled by a senseless herd of humans. Aronofsky does have a heart As a reward for being a ticket-buying human being youll also get an attempt at a rousing battle sequence thats louder than it is exciting.Noah gets some brief jolts of life from Anthony Hopkins as wrinkly old Methuselah and from Nick Nolte who provides the weary grizzled voice for one of the rock people. Yet Aronofsky blows what should be the greatest scene the one in which the animals are loaded into the ark Theyre a mass of gray and brown creatures viewed mostly from above their great variety of size shape color and temperament hardly in evidence. Thats a long way from John Hustons Noah tootling his flute as camels giraffes goats and a few tigers placidly step onto his attractive (if not so watertight-looking) boat in The Bible In the Beginning. Aronofsky doesnt want to instill wonder; hes more interested in drab yet expensive-looking wrath. Hes made a movie about judgment that itself feels judgmental. Like his Creator giving mixed signals to his poor servants he doesnt seem to think much of his audience. He ordered them moved and lo they were moved.

"Noah floods the screen and mind review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNoah floods the screen and mind reviewDarren Aronofskys Noah is a mad allegory of the Bibles most destructive episode a contradictory yet consuming film. If nothing else it succeeds as spectacle.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 27 2014NoahStarring Russell Crowe Jennifer Connelly Anthony Hopkins Emma Watson and Ray Winstone. Directed by Darren Aronofsky. At GTA theatres. 138 minutes. 14ADarren Aronofskys Noah is a mad allegory of the Bibles most destructive episode a contradictory yet consuming film of axe-swinging pacifists benevolent rock monsters and a strangely ambiguous God.""Let me tell you a story ... "" Russell Crowes title patriarch says to his family midway through as he proceeds to relate the conventional biblical creation saga prelude to the coming global flood and animal-filled escape vessel he has foreseen in hallucinatory visions.Article Continued BelowBut the strict Sunday school account of Noahs Ark is not the one pursued by Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel who previously teamed for the considerably trippier The Fountain. Here again they explore big ideas about man versus nature and free will versus predestination but do so with stronger characters a more propulsive narrative and absolutely no fear of absurdity or anachronism. They seek both to instil awe and to provoke debate.Jennifer Connelly and Russell Crowe star in ""Noah.""  (Niko Tavernise / The Associated Press)  For better or worse (mostly better) they claw at the incongruities inherent in the story of the Flood the most obvious being the ""why"" question. Why would a loving and forgiving God (always referred to as ""the Creator"") wish to destroy all of humanity so soon after He created it?This troubling thought doesnt immediately vex Noah last son of Edens righteous Seth whom Crowe portrays with outer devotion but inner turbulence. Its a performance far better than most he has given in his assignments of late especially his misbegotten villain in the recent bomb Winters Tale.Crowes Noah comes on like the original hippie a man so devoted to life and nature that he chastises his son for picking a flower. Yet he can go full ninja when provoked brandishing axe knife or rod to smite anyone who threatens his family wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) sons Shem (Douglas Booth) Ham (Logan Lerman) and Japheth (Leo Carroll) plus adopted daughter Ila (Emma Watson).As if the landscape isnt forbidding enough -- Matthew Libatiques mobile lens shoots unaltered Icelandic terrain that already looks apocalyptic -- Noah and his clan must be on constant lookout for murderous and carnivorous city dwellers who have incurred the Creators wrath by ravaging the planets natural resources. Theyre led by Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone in full villain mode) a vile descendant of Eden outcast Cain.Noah has in his corner his wizened grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) who helps him divine the Creators unspoken wishes through platitudes and servings of tea apparently laced with hallucinogens.True to Bible basics Noah sets out to build a giant Ark filled with his family a matched gender set of all the Earths birds and animals and a mandate to created ""a new Eden"" once the 40-day waters subside.A subplot pitting environmentalists against barbarians brings currency to the chronicle but not at the expense of Aronofskys grander plan which is to fully illustrate and dramatize the Flood and its internecine aftermath.If nothing else Noah succeeds as pure spectacle offering up nightmare sights and sounds of Old Testament reckoning that top anything previously brought to the screen (and that thankfully arent presented in 3D).Awe-inspiring crane and helicopter shots show the Arks assembly in a forest ringed by Tubal-cains hordes who threaten to invade at any moment -- and do when the rains begin to thunder out of the heavens. The story flies by even at a running time of 137 minutes.The film gets the big picture so right with added oomph by Clint Mansells grandiloquent score its easier to forgive the many instances where the smaller details fail.Its passing strange for example that Aronofsky and production designer Mark Friedberg went to great lengths to build the Ark to biblical specifications (it resembles two giant wooden shipping containers strapped together) yet got careless with the clothing (you could brand it L.L. Bean Ancient) and weapons (modern forged-steel knives and rocket launchers).Another screenplay shortcoming has the Arks animals being drugged into submission by a narcotic smoke that doesnt seem to affect humans. It solves the problem of beasts eating each other but you have to wonder if a more likely and humane method of animal control couldnt have been devised.One script novelty that seems completely ludicrous yet isnt so much on closer inspection involves the giant stone monsters called Watchers who help Noah build the Ark and repel hordes.Voiced by Nick Nolte Frank Langella and Mark Margolis they look like rustic versions of Transformers robots -- maybe we should call them Rock-timus Prime? -- but theyre actually based on fallen angels known as Nephilim who are referenced in the Bible.Just as Peter Jackson used explanatory appendixes from The Lord of the Rings to pad out the story in his The Hobbit trilogy so Aronofsky and Handel make the most of biblical arcana. You cant really fault them for taking a few liberties since the Bible says Noah lived until the age of 950 hardly what youd call an unassailable assertion.Aronofsky and Handel bring emotional fireworks to the films final act when the story returns to the contradictions inherent in humans being asked to do violence in the Lords name.Noahs family is torn asunder and his mental stability is threatened as sexual and societal tensions aboard the Ark reach a potentially violent impasse between religious fundamentalism and human compassion.Its here where the acting truly exceeds spectacle and Noah asks its most thoughtful question What would it profit a man to placate a silent and inscrutable God yet lose his humanity and family in so doing?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Noah By Peter Travers March 27 2014 More News Peter Travers Reviews Biblical Epic Noah Darren Aronofsky on the Genesis of Noah The Gospel According to Darren Aronofsky All Stories >> The floods is threatning My very life today Gimme gimme shelter Or Im gonna fade away --The Rolling Stones More News Peter Travers Reviews Biblical Epic Noah Darren Aronofsky on the Genesis of Noah The Gospel According to Darren Aronofsky All Stories >> Pick your gospel the Scriptures or rock amp; roll. Both figure into director Darren Aronofskys Noah a biblical epic that follows no rules except its creators teeming imagination. The damn nerve Yeah like youd expect Aronofsky the firebrand to trot out a gentle story of Noah escorting animals two-by-two into his ark while God destroys the world by flood. The Book of Genesis tells us why the Lord wanted a redo on creation but reveals nothing about what Noah was thinking. Enter Aronofsky 45 to grapple with the unanswered Noah questions he has obsessed about since his teens. His Noah played by Russell Crowe like a gathering storm is a figure of howling torment bowing to Gods will even as he considers his own fragile humanity. Heresy? Hardly - though the film will surely jangle scholars with its deviations digital trickery souped-up battles pipe guns sexual activity an ark stowaway and what appear to be giant robot refugees from Michael Bays Transformers protecting Noah and his family. My advice Hold off on burning Aronofsky at the stake till you see Noah a film of grit grace and visual wonders that for all its tech-head modernity is built on a spiritual core. The Brooklyn-born Aronofsky and his Harvard roomie and writing partner Ari Handel - ""two not very religious Jewish guys"" says the director - are hellbent on making their Noah relevant for believers and skeptics alike. An impossible task? Probably. Noah trips on its ambitions and a need to cram so damn much in. But you never doubt its passion to rise above formula and push boundaries. Aronofsky has been doing that since his 1998 debut feature Pi which used math and madness to discover among other things Gods identity. His movies from Requiem for a Dream and The Fountain (a test of patience even for die-hard fans) to The Wrestler and Black Swan differ wildly in style and themes but all plunge boldly into the minds of characters in crisis. Crowes nuanced performance holds steady as the world spins around Noah. Its a world including Noahs wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) unnamed in the Bible and their three sons Shem (Douglas Booth) Ham (Logan Lerman) and Japheth (Leo Carroll). The young-Hollywood quotient intensifies with Harry Potters Emma Watson as the orphan Ila Shems intended. Ila is barren which is a negative if you want to repopulate the world. One touch from Noahs mentor Methuselah (a nicely droll Anthony Hopkins) followed by a quickie with Shem solves the problem. Stay with me. Theres Noahs enemy Tubal-Cain (the great Ray Winstone) whose followers are descended from Cain the first murderer. They all want on the ark. The Watchers fallen angels who look like Transformers made of stone beat them off. Only Tubal-Cain manages to sneak on board which causes no end of family strife made worse when Noah wants to kill Ilas baby since Noah claims God wants only animals to inherit the Earth. Got that? Theres enough plot here to fill 40 days and 40 nights of reality TV. But Crowe makes Noahs self-doubt believable and moving. Aronofsky wants us to share the tension Noah feels between blind faith and free choice. And hes reaching millennials on their own digital terms making images gloriously shot by Matthew Libatique into metaphors in the manner of Bible stories. The ark built to scale on sets in Long Island and Brooklyn is a primitive and powerful vessel much like the movie that houses it. Its not just that Noah denies shelter for his fellow humans. In the name of God he engages in the slaughter of enemies and innocents. Is he obeying orders or playing God? Miraculously Aronofsky has spent 130 million of Hollywood money on a visionary art film that asks us to examine what we believe. In this flawed fiercely relevant film wonders never cease.

Truth Teller takes a look at the studios own behind-the-scenes promotional video to see what the movie gets right and wrong. (Julie Percha/The Washington Post) By Ann Hornaday March 27 2014 Follow AnnHornaday Old Testament fury has rarely come to such spectacularly fearsome life than in ""Noah"" Darren Aronofskys audacious adaptation of one of the Bibles best-known but still enigmatic chapters. Be warned Anyone familiar with the 500-year-old man and his ark may need to check some of their most cherished visualizations of him at the theater door. No cozy two-by-two images of beatific giraffes grace this ""Noah."" Like any good artist Aronofsky has avoided predictable literalist retellings of beloved Sunday school stories by inserting new characters bringing parenthetical figures to the fore and making one of historys most enduring and universal myths his very own. The result is a movie that is clearly deeply respectful of its source material but also at times startlingly revisionist a go-for-broke throwback to Hollywood biblical epics of yore that combines grandeur and grace as well as a generous dollop of goofy overstatement. Viewers may not agree about what theyve seen when they come out of ""Noah."" But theres no doubt that Aronofsky has made an ambitious serious even visionary motion picture whose super-sized popcorn-movie vernacular may occasionally submerge the storys more reflective implications but never drowns them entirely. Appropriately enough Aronofsky starts In the Beginning and after a brief prologue revisiting Adam and Eve original sin and the fatal rivalry between Cain and Abel catches up with Noah as a boy who by virtue of his lineage and an enchanted snakeskin bestowed on him by his father is clearly destined for greater things. Conceived and staged like a conventional superhero origin story ""Noah"" then finds the grown-up protagonist -- played by a solemn haunted-looking Russell Crowe -- living in Canaan alongside his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) and their sons Ham Shem and eventually Japheth. Canaan is a desolate world of arid deserts ruthless tribal warfare and dead cities but also supernatural wonders. When Noah begins to experience visions of the apocalyptic flood to come Aronofsky choreographs them not as words-from-on-high messages from the divine but as stylized terrifying unconscious visions. Fans of the filmmakers work -- from ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""The Fountain"" to ""Black Swan"" -- wont be surprised to learn that hes at his best with these fantastical mystically inclined sequences. Hes just as evocatively expressive with the most technically challenging set pieces of the story the arduous construction of the enormous Ark (here produced according to biblical proportions down to the last cubit) the arrival of the animals and that annihilating flood which Aronofsky stages as an awesome cascade of rainstorms geysers and terrifying waves. Amid such visual busyness Crowe and Connelly deliver impressively grounded powerful performances with Crowe playing Noah first as a humble divinely inspired servant and eventually as a wild-eyed zealot and Connelly brimming with earthy rectitude as his far more steady-eyed wife. One of the most delightful reshufflings is a central role for Noahs ancient forebear Methuselah played by Anthony Hopkins in a mischievous and altogether convincing turn as a white-haired figure of mystical oracular wisdom. So much of ""Noah"" is so good and so impressively executed that when discordant notes are sounded they do so with clanging dissonance. Taking ill-advised pages from both 1950s animator Ray Harryhausen and the current big-studio predilection for comic-book movies and young-adult teen romances Aronofsky creates characters and story lines that feel wildly out of place -- not because they dont appear in Scripture but because theyre so at odds with the often brilliant aesthetic language that animates the rest of the film. (Well chalk up Noahs surprisingly sophisticated wardrobe of primitive-chic leathers and open-work knits to artistic license.) The most distracting of Aronofskys creations by far are the Watchers -- fallen angels who roam the broken world like mournful stiff-jointed behemoth seemingly hewn from desert stone and resembling rock em sock em robots when pressed into heavy-duty smiting. Every action film nowadays seems to wind up being ""Transformers"" and sadly ""Noah"" is no different especially when it comes time for a final grandiose showdown between the Watchers and the oncoming forces of evil. Those forces by the way are led by an otherwise marginal character named Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) a bloodthirsty leader who probably hasnt made it into most Sunday morning curricula. His role in Noahs mission and ensuing adventure on the Ark as well as a budding love story between Shem (Logan Lerman) and a girl named Ila (Emma Watson) will surely give some literalists exegetical fits -- not least because Tubal-cain comes to be a proxy for the kind of anti-conservationist theology that Aronofsky uses ""Noah"" to obliquely critique. Although its understandable that the filmmaker wanted to make ""Noah"" a parable of environmental stewardship for many believers the story is primarily about hearing and responding to Gods voice. Aronofsky doesnt necessarily give that reading short shrift but as Noah becomes increasingly doctrinaire -- culminating in a bizarre deeply troubling passage involving the Arks most vulnerable pair of creatures -- its clear that the filmmaker is far more interested in human agency. He even seems to anticipate the New Testament when Naameh pleads with her husband -- ever more urgently -- to reconsider his own dogmatism in favor of ideas like mercy forgiveness and simple goodness. Those are fascinating passages beautifully presented by Connelly as the movies most steadfast moral voice. As off-putting as ""Noahs"" juiced-up subplots and cinder-eyed Watchers can be its impossible not to be impressed engaged and moved by Aronofskys own passionate commitment to the Noah story which has reportedly captivated him since he was an adolescent. Like interpreters through the millennia Aronofsky has taken Noahs journey sincerely to heart processed it through his own singular visual and moral imagination and come up with a narrative that feels deeply personal broadly mythical and cannily commercial all at the same time. That feels just about right for ""Noah"" which ultimately invites viewers to form their own meanings whether theyre about sacrifice and obedience stewardship and service or the enduring entertainment value of an epic adventure that thousands of years on still manages to astonish.

Photo Niko Tavernise Associated Press Noah review Good tale has strong actors and not just 2 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Noah Drama. Starring Russell Crowe Anthony Hopkins and Jennifer Connelly. Directed by Darren Aronofsky. (PG-13. 138 minutes.) At first it sounds as if the wind is making a strangled wailing as it blows through the slats of Noahs ark. But a closer listen reveals it as the sound of people screaming of thousands trying to stay afloat and sinking. Its layer upon layer of human noise piled and piled until it sounds elemental - as Noah and his family sit in the middle of the ark dry safe and horrified. ""Noah"" is no silly action blockbuster with a biblical pretext. Rather its the product of writer-director Darren Aronofskys vigorous engagement with the biblical story and what it might mean in our time. The story itself has demands built in It posits a vision of humanity gone astray in which those on the side of the Creator are pitted against those opposed to the divine will. Right off that means a filmmakers choosing sides and making decisions about good and bad right and wrong. In Aronofskys telling humanity went in two directions after the murder of Abel by Cain. The godless sons of Cain went off and created the industrial world raping the Earth. They became warriors fashioned metal weapons and began eating animals. They ignored the demands of stewardship and stressed only their dominion over the Earth and other living creatures. Meanwhile the virtuous sons of Seth lived off the land in harmony with creation. They were vegetarians proto-environmentalists and anti-industry. More in Movies Sabotage review Schwarzenegger somehow better with age Jodorowskys Dune review The fantastic film that never was Cheap Thrills review Fine film but not for the delicate Cesar Chavez review Inspiring man uninspired film Ernest amp; Celestine review Outcasts endure bear of a fight Of course ""Noah"" is going to be controversial. It was either that or have something dead onscreen and ""Noah"" is most certainly not dead. Yet even those who think a meal isnt a meal without a hunk of bleeding pain on the plate might be assuaged by the movies pro-industry statement hiding there in plain sight The sons of Cain are living a lot better than the sons of Seth. Ten generations since Adam and all Noah has to show for himself is a tattered tent pitched amid the rocks. In fact as the movie begins Seths descendants consist of no one but Noahs family as the murderous sons of Cain draw nearer. Things are looking hopeless when Noah (Russell Crowe) has a curious dream in which he envisions the destruction of the world. He doesnt know what it means or what hes supposed to do about it and so he goes in search of his grandfather Methuselah for guidance. And Methuselah can only be Anthony Hopkins who plays the oldest man in the world like a chipper jovial Welsh Yoda. The early biblical world is portrayed by Aronofsky as a place of barren desolation of rocks and hard earth. When characters talk about saying goodbye to life as they know it one has to wonder whats there to miss. At the same time the film is full of beautiful visuals as when two doves suddenly decide to head toward the ark and the camera tracks them above as they fly. ""Noah"" provides two striking instances of silhouettes against the sky. In the first Noah and his wife (Jennifer Connelly) discuss their options just as the night is cracking and a new day is vibrating a golden glow on the horizon. In another scene we see men killing each other - time-lapse photography of various silhouettes in various hats swinging various weapons - a succession that when reduced to spectacle looks like nothing but madness. The films special effects never seem special in the moment which is as it should be. When every snake and reptile on the Earth starts heading in one direction the viewers response isnt awe at what can be done on a computer but awe at the abundant forms that life takes. Everything must be saved Noah says lest a ""small piece of creation"" be ""lost forever. Its our job to look after them."" Crowe ably conveys the oppressive weight of Noahs responsibility the burden of enacting Gods will. But then all the performances are strong which is the mark of good direction. No one postures no one plays history. Every actor has clearly spent time contemplating and working through the specific and real emotions being experienced by the character. Emma Watson is lovely as a young woman whose inability to conceive makes her an odd match for Noahs eldest son. Ray Winstone as a general of the house of Cain is a complex figure - a villain perhaps but the one character who sounds most like a modern man. ""Noah"" is a great movie until the arks doors close. Then for a half hour it becomes a strange and difficult movie more interesting than satisfying. But ultimately ""Noah"" finds its way back to land. Unlike most action movies its the furthest thing from a cynical piece of work. Its a movie to wrestle with and talk about. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

The first three months of 2014 have served up a top animated feature (The Lego Movie) a splendid documentary about a mad artist (Jodorowskys Dune) and that indescribable delight of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Now to round out the trimester Darren Aronofsky brings wild ambition and thrilling artistry to one of the Old Testaments best-known most dramatic least plausible stories -- Noah and the ark -- with Russell Crowe infusing the role of Gods first seaman and zookeeper with all his surly majesty. In Genesis 68 God is displeased with the wickedness of men and resolves to kill all humans along with the rest of the earths creatures. (What did they do?) ""I will blot out from the earth the human beings I have created -- people together with animals and creeping things and birds of the air for I am sorry that I have made them."" God commands the one righteous man Noah to build an ark summon his family and two of every kind of living thing and fill it with provisions for the entire menagerie. SPOILER ALERT FOR INFIDELS ONLY After many months at sea the water subsides the arks inhabitants disperse and God promises Noah ""I will never again curse the ground because of humankind ... nor will I ever again destroy every living creature as I have done ... Be fruitful and multiply."" Like a golfer with an indulgent scorekeeper humanity gets a mulligan. The penalty all but one family must die. In pop culture the ark story has multiplied dozens of times usually with a smile. John Huston played Noah as a benign patriarch in his 1966 The Bible ... In the Beginning. Danny Kaye sang his way through the role in Richard Rodgers Broadway musical Two by Two; and in Evan Almighty Steve Carell was a modern Noah who got pooped on by birds and beasts alike. A rare adaptation with anything like Aronofskys sociopolitical seriousness was the 1928 silent film Noahs Ark which compares the flood (""A deluge of water drowning a world of lust"") to World War I (""A deluge of blood drowning a world of hate""). Opening a year before the stock-market crash -- which could be seen as heavenly judgment on the Jazz Age -- and meant as a message of peace Michael Curtizs movie stoked its own fatalities three stunt players died during the shooting of the flood sequence. (READ Tim Newcomb on the battle over Noah) The waters are mostly digital now; no humans were killed in the making of this Noah. But Aronofsky emboldened by the 330 million worldwide box-office take of his last film Black Swan took some huge artistic and canonical gambles with this dead-serious borderline-delirious movie. (So did Paramount Pictures and the movies other backers; Noah cost about 130 million to produce.) Sampling from the Old Testament and its apocrypha plus bits of The Whole Earth Catalog the director has hatched his most daring film since the 2006 The Fountain a sadly underappreciated work that imagined the worlds violent past and utopian future through the eyes of a man (Hugh Jackman) trying to find a cure for his wifes spreading cancer. Noah is about a man whose mission is to obliterate Earths past and godfather its future. Replacing the word God with Creator and taking other scriptural liberties the movie risks confusing those who dont take the Bible literally and alienating those who do. The movie has been banned in several Muslim countries including Indonesia Qatar Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. In the West it has won some converts. Crowe and the Noah team secured an audience with Pope Francis and an urgent campaign from Paramount brought a flock of evangelicals aboard Aronofskys ark. (READ Religious leaders give their blessing to Noah) Thats a coup in itself for Noah recasts the first doomsday story as the first climate-change tale -- a disaster-movie scenario that could soon recur. For the Old Testament God simply insert natures God (the Founding Fathers name for the Creator) and see the flood as a predictor for natures rebuking modern industry for polluting and overheating the atmosphere. Scientists predict that within decades most of the worlds coastal cities will be underwater if emissions are not drastically curtailed. Aronofskys text disguised as a fable is a warning of this inconvenient truth. He might be paraphrasing the old spiritual ""No more fire the flood this time."" In Aronofskys Bible-era setting for this toxic environment Noah is a survivalist taking revenge on urban iniquity. Seeing the industrialized cities around him as wicked for their destruction of the environment as much as their sensual excesses Noah assumes power of life and death over all living things. This fable of early man is The Croods with a Mensa IQ -- and when the rabble storms the ark its a home-invasion thriller of a family taking refuge in their divine-fallout shelter. As the unsaved hordes climb the hulls of the boat like zombies scaling the Jerusalem walls in World War Z our hero fights to keep them out. Its the end of the world as they know it and he feels fine Apocalypse Noah. (READ TIMEs reviews of The Croods and World War Z) In the Genesis version God does all the talking; Noah is his silent servant and enabler. But in the gospel according to Aronofsky and co-screenwriter Ari Handel the Lord doesnt boom basso profundo or soothe in Morgan Freemans baritone. Indeed he speaks not in words at all but in visions that might be dreams aided by hallucinogens. The Aronofsky Israel is a land of magic where rock giants that were once men (the Nephilim) stride the earth where trees instantly bloom around Noah to provide wood for the ark and where animals flock to the building site as if from supernatural bidding. (Once inside they are sedated so as not to devour one another.) In this mythic realm Noahs trance-revelation -- of being submerged as creatures swim past him toward a boat on the surface -- has to be the Creators command to build the ark. ""Fire consumes water cleanses"" Noah says. ""He destroys all but only to start again."" To buttress the biblical recounting Aronofsky imports elements of fantasy literature -- the Nephilim the stone-man Watchers similar to J.R.R. Tolkiens Ents who help Noah construct the ark and fend off invaders -- and Shakespearean tragedy. From Genesis 4 the movie borrows the character of Tubal-Cain ""the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron."" (Called the King of the Nephilim in the 1928 Noahs Ark he nearly succeeds in stowing away on the boat -- a plot device Aronofsky expands on.) Here as played by the fiercely swaggering Ray Winstone Tubal-Cain is not only the thug chieftain of the city sinners leading the charge on the ark but also the man Noah saw kill his own father. One of his sons is Ham but Noahs true spiritual kin is Hamlet. Ransacking genres far and wide Aronofsky also samples art-film cosmology. He recapitulates the first chapters of Genesis (Noah was just the ninth generation after Adam) with quick images of a snake and an apple that pulses like a human heart and when Noah briefly doubts his mission he sees himself in reptilian form as if he were in danger of becoming his own evil-twin snake. Aronofskys visual summary of the worlds creation a story that Noah tells his sons is like the 17-min. history of the universe in Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life retold in a minute or two but no less imposingly oneiric. (READ Corliss on The Tree of Life at Cannes and beyond) This Noah is not a genial Doctor Dolittle. Burdened by his foreknowledge of the flood and its consequences hes in no mood to talk with the animals. Even in the early scenes hes more herbalist than PETA activist. He is sobered by the realization that his awful task is to save his family -- wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly who won an Oscar as Crowes wife in A Beautiful Mind) sons Shem (Douglas Booth) Ham (Logan Lerman) and Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll) and Shems betrothed Ila (Emma Watson) -- while letting everyone else die. Naameh and the rest realize that too. They respect Noahs leadership even as they must question some of his decisions. ACTUAL SPOILER ALERT Once devoted to replenishing the earth with his childrens spawn Noah now accepts his and the worlds mortality. ""Everything that was beautiful everything that was good we shattered"" he says proclaiming ""We will work complete our task and die with the rest."" Naameh is past child-bearing age and Ila was rendered barren from a beating she endured as a child. Noah is disturbed when he learns that his grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) has laid a shamans hands on the girl and restored her fertility. (SEE The trailer for Noah) In the movies two most intimate and shocking sequences Noah keeps Ham from saving Nael (Madison Davenport) a sweet refugee from Tubal-Cains land and bringing her on the ark as his bride. He then tells the pregnant Ila that if she bears a daughter he will kill the newborn. He has become the angry Old Testament God who ordered Abraham to slay his son Isaac before calling off the sacrifice. Apparently the Almightys genocidal impulse in his flood scheme is contagious; it has spread to a man who has an even more severe view of humanity deeming it unworthy of a do-over. In the 1967 comedy Bedazzled when Peter Cook as the devil boasts of his satanic powers Dudley Moore as a modern Faust shouts ""Youre a bleedin nutcase"" ""They said the same of Jesus Christ"" Cook protests and Moore retorts ""They said it of a lot of nutcases too."" The very pertinent question in Noah is whether its hero is Gods chosen or a nutcase. Is he a visionary or just seeing things? Methuselah has told his grandson ""You must trust that he speaks in a way that you can understand"" so viewers are encouraged to take on faith Noahs decision to build the ark. Later when he must rely not on the whispers of the deity but on his own fallible resources he may be only a willful man -- a beautiful mind -- driven toward fatal delusion. END SPOILER ALERT. (SEE Seven other movies based on the Bible) In this Old Testament passion play the director seemingly had the same influence on his actors that the Creator did on Noah. Along with Crowe giving his strongest performance in years they rise to meet Aronofskys ferocious commitment. Connelly who looks as if she had been hewn from flint is the voice of reason the heart of besieged humanity. Watson reveals a mature intensity far beyond Harry Potters Hermione; her tears could be mankinds own keening elegy. Hopkins the one jolly soul in the family is a sage from an earlier age -- the mesmerist as optimist. And Winstone representing all that is wily and rapacious works from an animosity toward a God that will speak to the ark builder but not to him. As Noah threatens to go off the rails so does Noah. But thats inspiring too proof of a grownup artist struggling with big issues and then resolving them to create a crazy-great statement that is also a superb entertainment. In its grand recklessness the movie is closest to Aronofskys debut feature the 1998 Pi in which Max Cohen a neurotic mathematician gets mixed up with a Hassidic sect that believes the string of numbers Max has discovered is a secret code sent by God. That movie cost 60000 this one about 2000 times as much. But both films live by Maxs creed ""Im on the edge and thats where it happens."" (SEE Corlisss review of  aka Pi) Big-time directors and the studios that bankroll them prefer to dwell in the comfortable familiar center where mammon is God and the only divine word comes from focus groups. So for Aronofsky to construct an expensive spectacle and to throw liturgical and dramatic challenges like lightning bolts at every member of the audience is hardly less an achievement than to build and float an ark 300 cubits long (450 ft. or 137 m). Rarely has a film that flirts this solemnly with ambition bending toward madness been so masterly in carrying its spectators to its heights and through its depths. On both levels Noah is a water thrill ride worth taking. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

"Noah Review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW Noah  1/2 Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Neither fish nor fowl neither foul nor inspiring director and co-writer Darren Aronofskys strange and often rich new movie ""Noah"" has enough actual filmmaking to its name to deserve better handling than a plainly nervous Paramount Pictures has given it.Aronofskys a determined sort of fever dreamer whose work so far includes ""Black Swan"" and ""The Wrestler"" in the popular success category along with his earlier ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream."" His latest one of the nuttier Bible-related movies in the history of the medium finds the filmmaker trying to cope with a heavy load of digital effects (flood; supernatural beams of light; giant rock-formation beasts that move talk and provide nonunion ark-building labor) and a heavier load of audience preconceptions. Many in the prospective audience will resist what Aronofsky has done to Their Noah. This one played with steely purpose by Russell Crowe is a flawed angry and murderously conflicted man just trying to do his job as he sees it Listen to the Creator prepare for the cleansing annihilating flood fulfill his mission and then live with the emotional consequences. In the Broadway musical ""Two by Two"" starring Danny Kaye theres a song called ""Poppa Knows Best."" Poppa here by contrast threatens his own kin at knifepoint thus risking the hostility of every woman man bird and animal on the vessel.Heres why ""Noah"" actually works much of the time even when its just asking for parodists to have their way with such a potential folly. Aronofsky is interested in these people as people not pop-up saints straight out of Sunday school. Although the director has a habit of letting the internal momentum of his dialogue scenes putter and then stall his penchant for tight hand-held close-ups maintains a crude heightened realism. Now and then Aronofsky must pull back for more generic digitally complex panoramas involving marauding armies or rock-formation ""Watchers"" (fallen angels resembling a ""Flintstones""-era version of ""Transformers"") doing their thing. There are two movies duking it out in ""Noah"" one close to the ground the other up in the air taking it all in. At its occasional best the film marries new technology with simple striking visual notions such as Noahs premonitions of the flood to come. Jennifer Connelly emotes mightily if rather demurely as Noahs valiant wife (here named Naameh; she never made the cut in the Book of Genesis version of the story). Their three sons are portrayed by Logan Lerman (Ham); Douglas Booth (Shem whose steady is played by Emma Watson); and young Leo Carroll (Japheth). Anthony Hopkins enjoys three or four scenes as Methuselah Noahs grandfather a man who has seen much and who at this point in his life simply wants a fistful of berries to munch on. (This bit is the closest ""Noah"" comes to comic relief.)Theres a roiling Cain/Abel dynamic between the older boys and when Ham falls under the sway of Noahs sworn enemy the latest in a relatively short line of bloodthirsty godless men descended from the Cain the movie finds its most affecting element. Ray Winstones seething portrayal of the antagonist and eventual ark stowaway stays just this side of caricature just as Crowe -- say what you will hes one of the only English-speaking actors alive who can plausibly anchor a Bible epic -- finds the human being beneath the Job-like adversities.A lot of this picture is dubious starting with the rock-giants the friendliest of which is voiced by Nick Nolte. (Honestly Who else?) I came to ""Noah"" a Bible know-nothing with zero concrete expectations. I must say though the animals get the shaft. They spend most of the movie sedated and sleeping in the bowels of the massive ark which looks like a shipping barge made out of gopher wood while the humans work through their problems. So be it. Aronofsky has said he didnt want to indulge in one of those cliched images of Noah shot from a low angle backed by two of this and two of that. The movie may be erratic and its sillier heavier passages recall its makers nutso epic ""The Fountain."" Yet its unpredictable which is saying something and it argues rather sweetly that if we had just listened to Noah wed all be vegetarians as well as more careful stewards of the only planet weve got.mjphillipstribune.com""Noah"" - 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for violence disturbing images and brief suggestive content)Running time 219Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Darren Aronofsky Noah (movie) Broadway Theater Heavy Engineering Theater REVIEW Sabotage  REVIEW Jodorowskys Dune  1/2 REVIEW Shirin in Love  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-noah-20140327,0,7798831.column",200,noah39,noah,chicagotribune

The addicts of ""Requiem for a Dream"" the obsessed ballerina in ""Black Swan"" even that battered grappler from ""The Wrestler"" -- what are they mortifying their bodies for except one brief shining moment of transcendence? And those are just his mainstream movies (or as mainstream as Aronofsky gets). The math-driven genius of ""Pi"" the grieving lover of ""The Fountain"" -- these characters moved into the metaphysical (and for some audiences the utterly incomprehensible). So it was as inevitable that Aronofsky would come to the Old Testament as that Martin Scorsese would with ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" come to the New. Unfortunately Aronofskys film has already been met with some of the criticism that Scorseses had and perhaps with more reason. Scorseses film was based on a novel. Aronofsky though is an interpretation of the Bible itself - and one that takes a number of liberties. But worse they dont help the film -- not because theyre additions but simply because they dont quite work and detract from what is otherwise a thoughtful and emotional work. For example Genesis itself mentions that there were ""giants"" during the time of Noah and Aronofsky expands on this by creating ""The Watchers"" towering (albeit fallen) angels who help Noah build the ark. But the visualization of them is awful -- they look like blocky muddy Transformers - and they hurt every scene theyre in. Aronofsky (who co-wrote the script with Ari Handel) also puts a stowaway on the ark in order to add some tension and violence. But life on the ark is already tense enough as it is in this version; we dont need extra characters or contrived conflicts to keep us interested. Its a shame because what Aronofsky does give this familiar tale is a great love of the Earth and a wonderfully complex Noah. The Bible doesnt tell us much about him -- hes a good man gets a message from God and builds an ark for himself the worlds animals and his family. When the rain finally stops he makes wine and gets drunk. And thats his own arc and where his story pretty much ends. This film though asks who this man really was. And far from the avuncular Noahs of stories past this prophet is a brooding environmentalist who loves nature distrusts man and isnt at all surprised God is sending a flood to wash the whole place clean. Hes a bit of a misanthrope -- and capable of almost anything. This is not the Dr. Doolittle character of John Hustons ""The Bible"" and Crowe gives him a great understandable (and yet frightening) drive. We see why hes the perfect man for this task. Yet we also marvel at what little tenderness he gives his wife (a drawn but loving Jennifer Connelly) how oblivious he is to his sons. All of this is genuinely provocative (as is a late twist which nods a bit to Abrahams story). There are other great specific details too like the shed skin of the Serpent which becomes a sort of prototype for tefillin straps and a dreamy hallucinatory quality which has colored many of Aronofskys films. Its particularly appropriate here as in this telling there is no booming voice of God; men experience him in their dreams see his words as images. Or they dont; a serious subtext to the film is how those images are misinterpreted or how painfully abandoned people feel when they get no communication at all. N.J.

Those ideas those additions are fine; despite the criticism ""Noah"" has already faced from some believers theres nothing heretical in these embellishments. The problem isnt in Aronofskys additions but in their lack of imagination; giants who look like living boulders fiery battles with hordes of villains from the east these are leftovers from a ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. Better is when the film isnt trying to turn this into an action epic full of external conflict but simply being a character study full of internal ones Here stands a man asked to prepare for an unspeakable thing by an unknowable presence.

""Noah"" has its share of interesting ideas from rock-covered fallen angels to Noahs idea that he and his family should be the last human beings on earth per his interpretation of what ""the creator"" tells him but the film winds up feeling like a bit of a soggy slog both overblown and underwritten. See video Emma Watson Introduces New Noah Trailer Full of Epic Apocalyptic Destruction (Video) The tricky thing about adapting Bible stories into drama is that the characters tend to have only one or two dominant traits rather than emerging as richly complicated people. In the case of ""Noah"" we not only have to allow for quite literal deus ex machina -- a lot of story elements can only be swallowed with a healthy dose of ""because God willed it thats why"" -- but were also forced to deal with the practical implications of a story that ends up with a handful of people being left to repopulate the planet most of whom are already related by blood. As ""Noah"" tells it the world was divided after Adam and Eves expulsion from the Garden of Eden and Cains murder of Abel -- the line of Cain built decadent cities and exploited the resources and the line of Seth lived in peace and harmony. As such Cains heirs pretty much wiped out Seths until the only one left among the latter is young Noah who witnesses the murder of his own father. Years later Noah (Russell Crowe) and his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) try to instill his values in their sons. One night Noah has a vision of a terrible flood; he visits his grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) who slips him a mickey via some hallucinogenic tea leaving Noah convinced that he must build an ark to save the animals of the world while the creator wipes out the wicked with a great flood. Methuselah gives Noah a seed when which planted creates a spring (or fountain for you future MFA candidates looking for motifs in Aronofskys work) that in turn causes a forest to spring up all across the wasteland. With the help of the watchers (the aforementioned angels who were encrusted with rock and lava when they fell to earth trying to help mankind) Noah builds his watercraft. (Aronofsky apparently follows the specs from Genesis leading to a rather boxy and unwieldy ship and not the usual curved-bow boat weve seen in previous adaptations.) While oldest son Shem (Douglas Booth) is in love with Ila (Emma Watson) -- adopted by Noah as a young girl after he finds her wounded and abandoned -- there are no potential wives for middle son Ham (Logan Lerman Watsons ""Perks of Being a Wallflower"" co-star) or young Japheth (Leo McHugh Carroll). Noah goes out amidst the wicked (who have camped out in the area just outside the arks construction site) to rustle up some more daughters-in-law but when he sees Satan with Noahs face he thinks this means God intends to wipe out humanity including Noahs own bloodline. Also read Noah VFX Firm Loses a Bundle on Biblical Epic (Exclusive) This doesnt go over particularly well with the rest of the family especially after Methuselah blesses Ilas previously barren womb. (If youre prone to inappropriate snickering bite down hard during this moment.) Once the admittedly impressive flood happens the third act vacillates between Noah threatening to murder Ilas child and an embittered Ham hiding the evil Tubal Cain (Ray Winstone) who has stowed away on the ark. ""Noah"" has snakes and bears and herbalist anesthesia and rock-angels and rampaging armies and panicky sinners so why is it such a drag? Clearly Aronofsky isnt out to make yet another stodgy Bible movie but it often feels as though hes reining in his showier artistic impulses lest he offend the faithful. As a result hes wound up with a movie that will please neither the ""Son of God"" crowd nor the people excited about a reunion between the director and leading lady of ""Requiem for a Dream."" Also read Darren Aronofsky Knew Nothing About Paramounts Last-Minute Noah Changes (Exclusive) Crowe pretty much plays it straight maintaining his hoarse intensity even when Noah goes to some dark places in what he thinks is the service of the creator. All the other characters are too easily summed up (e.g. ""loyal"" ""loving"" ""duplicitous"") leaving little room for the actors to flesh them out. Some might consider the story of Noah to be as much of a bad-luck charm to the movies as ""Macbeth"" is to the stage; the 1928 ""Noahs Ark"" produced by young Darryl F. Zanuck infamously led to the drowning of several extras during the big flood scene. No animals or cast members were harmed by ""Noah"" true but this new vessel doesnt do much for the floating zookeepers big-screen reputation. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Noah Review Uneven But Undeniably Bold Take on Biblical Tale | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Noah Scott Foundas Chief Film Critic foundasonfilm 93 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 20 2014 | 1001PM PT Man builds ark survives flood then wonders what it was all for in Darren Aronofskys long-awaited hotly debated biblical epic. Having made movies about obsessive characters looking for God -- or something like Him -- in the numerology of the Kabbalah (""Pi"") at the end of a heroin needle (""Requiem for a Dream"") and in the outer reaches of the galaxy (""The Fountain"") surely it was only a matter of time before Darren Aronofsky got to making one about a man with a direct line to the Creator. And so we have ""Noah"" in which the worlds most famous shipwright becomes neither the Marvel-sized savior suggested by the posters nor the ""environmentalist wacko"" prophesied by some test-screening Cassandras but rather a humble servant driven to the edge of madness in his effort to do the Lords bidding. Counterintuitive perhaps but by no means sacrilegious Aronofskys uneven but undeniably bold personal visually extravagant take on the Old Testament tale will surely polarize critics and audiences while riding a high sea of curiosity to strong initial worldwide B.O. Only time -- and word of mouth -- will tell if it can stay the course for anywhere near 40 days and nights (and top ""Black Swan""s 329 million global cume). Whatever comes of ""Noah"" (which opens this weekend in several foreign markets including Mexico a week ahead of its March 28 domestic launch) the film certainly ranks alongside ""The Great Gatsby"" and ""Gravity"" as one of the riskiest director-driven passion projects to be gambled on by todays ever more cautious major studios. And if Aronofskys 130 million 137-minute movie ultimately feels compromised at all its less by studio interference than by its directors own desire to make a metaphysical head movie that is also an accessible action blockbuster (where ""The Fountain"" tilted heavily toward the former). ""Noah"" does not always sit easily astride those competing impulses but it is never less than fascinating -- and sometimes dazzling -- in its ambitions. Once upon a time the famously austere French director Robert Bresson was enlisted by Dino De Laurentiis to film the Noah story for his planned ""The Bible ... In the Beginning"" only to be fired when he told the producer he didnt intend to film any of the animals just their tracks upon the sand. And there may be no better description of Aronofskys film than to say that it has one foot in the world of Bresson and the other in that of Jerry Bruckheimer. For starters ""Noah"" doesnt look like any biblical epic weve ever seen before with the verdant hillsides and ashen volcanic flatlands of Iceland standing in for the deserts of the Middle East photographed with rugged grandeur by Aronofskys longtime d.p. Matthew Libatique. Likewise the costumes (by ""American Hustle"" Oscar nominee Michael Wilkinson) eschew robes and sandals in favor of heartier attire that might best be described as proto-army surplus. As for the supposed ""liberties"" Aronofsky and co-screenwriter Ari Handel have taken with their sacrosanct source they arent boldfaced transgressions so much as interpretations additions and embellishments designed to flesh out the spare Noah narrative to feature length. This includes making the characters far younger than those described in the Good Book -- which if followed to the letter would have yielded an antediluvian ""Amour"" (another movie one should note with a role for a symbolical white dove). Aronofksys Noah (superbly played by Russell Crowe) doesnt hear Gods voice booming down from the heavens like in Bill Cosbys celebrated standup routine or sit on the stoop shooting the breeze with the Creator like Steve Carell in ""Evan Almighty."" Rather the looming flood and the mission of the ark come to him in the course of two vividly rendered hallucinogenic dreams -- one natural the other induced by some special ""tea"" served up by Noahs grandpa Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins leaving no bit of scenery unchewed). And because the story lacks a natural antagonist the film corrals one from elsewhere in Genesis in the form of Tubal-cain (played as a youth by Finn Wittrock) a descendant of the Abel-slaying Cain first seen in a brief prologue delivering a fatal blow to Noahs father Lamech (Marton Csokas) -- a scene that like much of ""Noah"" feels straight out of a 1940s frontier western. Later as a full-blown supervillain (Ray Winstone) hip to Noahs survivalist scheme Tubal-cain and his rogue army vow to hitch a ride on the ark or else die trying. (This leads to a large-scale battle sequence which while impressively staged is easily the films most conventional passage -- an extended outtake from Middle-earth.) Here is where you feel Aronofsky and Handel laboring intensely with only partial success to turn what has traditionally been something of a one-man show into more of an ensemble affair. Where Noah is the model locavore who takes from the land only as much as he needs and strives to be at one with his surroundings (but who being Russell Crowe can also kick serious butt when need be) Tubal-cain personifies the debauched resource-plundering wastrels God seeks to smite from the universe. And though Winstone plays the part with sinister flair the character never becomes much more than a stock bad guy on hand to pop up like a jack-in-the-box at the least convenient moments and to try wooing Noahs petulant Skywalker-ish son Ham (Logan Lerman) over to the dark side. Ham meanwhile may be patient zero for middle-child syndrome spending most of the movie sulking about wondering when hes going to become a man and staring dolefully at the beautiful Ila (Emma Watson) an orphan girl who was adopted as a child by Noah and his wife Naameh (a solid but underused Jennifer Connelly) and who becomes betrothed to their eldest son Shem (Douglas Booth). Even Ila gets her own inner conflict in the form of a barren womb that makes her feel like an unworthy bride -- especially you know given the pressure of repopulating the earth. But if the interpersonal dramas dont quite fully engage as spectacle ""Noah"" rarely disappoints commencing with the building of the ark itself. Designed by production designer Mark Friedberg (and built to the actual dimensions specified by the Bible on a New York soundstage) it is an awesome thing -- not the traditional sailing vessel of many an artists interpretation but rather an enormous wooden warehouse that makes the Maersk Alabama look like a lifeboat. In its construction Noah is lent several (huge) helping hands by the Watchers (the films version of the biblical Nephilim) fallen angels exiled to earth for their loyalty to mankind and imprisoned inside towering granite bodies that they lug about like walking mountains. Intricately designed and voiced by the likes of Frank Langella Nick Nolte and regular Aronofsky featured player Mark Margolis these weary witnesses to all the wonders and horrors of creation are skeptical at first of Noahs intentions but eventually rally to his aid and they become the most special (and emotionally resonant) of the movies many elaborate special effects. The arrival of the animals which appear to self-organize by phylum is a similarly marvelous sight (even if the creatures retain a conspicuous CGI appearance). Then comes the Frankenstorm in which the waters of the earth quite literally rise up to meet those of the heavens -- a suitably Dramamine-worthy sequence expertly rendered by Aronofsky and all his technicians. Not soon to be forgotten the image of humanitys last dregs clambering for a foothold on a lone rocky outcropping as it too is finally swallowed by the sea. Yet it is only after the tide has ebbed and a new day has dawned that ""Noah"" seems to come to its real place of purpose. Taking inspiration from a line in Genesis about Noahs post-flood descent into drunkenness Aronofsky and Handel imagine an exhausted hero who cant understand why if all mankind was meant to perish he and his family should be saved. And since that telephone to the heavens only receives calls Noah has no one to ask. Crowe is incredibly good in these scenes -- you feel his torment as if it were a fire burning him from the inside out -- culminating in a terrifying moment of near-infanticide that intentionally or not recalls James Masons explosive lament from Nicholas Rays ""Bigger Than Life"" ""God was wrong"" The purists will blanche -- injections of existential angst and self-doubt into Scripture are always guaranteed to rankle (as ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" proved). But its here that one feels fully why Aronofsky wanted to make this movie in the first place as Noahs own age of anxiety seems to echo directly into our own. The movie leaves us with a crystalline image of a man who feels most adrift when he is finally standing on dry land -- and who regardless of what faith one subscribes to cannot relate to that? For all its visual flourishes ""Noah"" offers an equally dynamic sonic experience with immersive multilayered effects designed to take full advantage of the new Dolby Atmos sound system and a richly orchestrated score by regular Aronofsky music man Clint Mansell that alternates thunderous percussive beats with New Age-y twangs and hums.

Reply Daniel Francis says April 3 2014 at 1008 am The director has abused the artist right to add/delete/modify. He lies and uglifies the original by his mindless additions. Reply Oscar Whitman says April 3 2014 at 751 am Darren Aronofsky is known for pushing the envelope to the fullest degree when it comes to his movie making. His version of ""Noah"" is no different. He pushes the envelope of inaccuracy of unfactual/erroneous information of phonylooking CGI special effects of really cheesey attempts to actually brand Noah as a freaking lunatic and the ultimate envelope of suggesting that the ""Fallen Angels"" (Rock Monsters) were actually on our side and just as ""hopelessly victimized and abandoned by God as we were"" -- Of course Im being patronizingly facetious but why not.? Is Darren an atheist? I guess its irrelevant to some people but it kinda makes me wonder if this director is perhaps lauching his own Propaganda - induced campaign to plant God-hating ideas in moviegoers minds. I hope most people are smart enough to realize that this film is not based on truth biblical or historical occurrences. Maybe Darren and the screenwriters got intoxicated or stoned or just decided they wanted to mock the Bible and the God/Man relationship in general. From the very beginning of the movie ie the written notices it was easy to see that the creators of this film were not in the least bit going after truth or moral concepts to positively encourage intellectual conversations. If he had stuck more closely atleast to historical documented info Aronofsky probably would have been much more successful in this endeavor. Yeah yeah yeah...regarding ""Black Swan"" but this here is NOAH. It truly fell short in a major way. Reply Jim Robinson says April 2 2014 at 310 pm Just a bad movie. No religious objections knew was going to a different kind of story....the rock men looked like they could have come from Galaxy Quest (actually that was a much more entertaining movie) and the digital effects reminded me more of the early 60s Jason and the Argonauts claymation or whatever they used back then. Poor story tedious to sit through but did hoping it would get better. It didnt. My biggest regret is that I shelled out way too much money watching it in IMAX. Entertaining it was not. Variety I question the taste of your reviewer. Will not rely on it anymore. Reply John S. says May 24 2015 at 1055 am What you refer to as ""claymation or whatever"" is technically called ""stop-motion animation"" and doesnt involve ""clay."" ""Jason and the Argonauts"" was animated by the brilliant Ray Harryhausen. The fact that you dont know any of that or didnt bother to look it up prevents your opinion from having any credibility whatsoever. Reply Vanessa says April 1 2014 at 445 pm We are too critical for our own good nowadays. It seems like we cant enjoy a movie anymore or allow people to entertain us. We have to criticize and be nit picky. Ive noticed that every movie that comes out and this accounts for every film no one is ever satisfied with anything at all. It doesnt matter how good or technically poor the movie was we decide to look at the negative light and that surely sucks the fun out of anything. I do not see anyone taking a camera and filming a ""better"" movie than the ones we tarnish. If its a bad movie? Why not laugh at it and enjoy the silly time we scheduled to see it rather than grouse? No one is ever satisfied. Films are fanatical; theyre never going to be spot on the nose. Were too darn spoiled to know better. Reply Jim says March 30 2014 at 429 pm Most disappointing movie I have seen in years. My wife wanted to walk out after the first 15 minutes but I wanted to see if it got better. It didnt. I hope this movie will sink in a flood of red ink. Reply valhalla says March 29 2014 at 952 pm You guys do know that this was based on a graphic novel and not the bible right? I dont know why you folks are tripping off of this but this guy is not religious nor is this movie being pushed as religious. I dont want to see this because there is too much CGI in it and it looks like crap. Reply Frank says March 29 2014 at 853 pm Just endured this box office soon to be flop. People walking out. No one knew what the hell this flick was all about. Rocks standing up and building the ark and who the hell is ""Seth"" as in Cane Able and seth. Is this like ""Moe Larry and Curley"" It took all I could do to not walk out myself but I kept thinking it would improve. No such luck. Reply ITTTY IT says March 29 2014 at 656 am Routine same-same F/X saturated disco beat edited on board Hollywood franchise slum predictive programming for the globalist MAFIAs exterminist agendas. Reply P Ardvark says March 28 2014 at 541 pm Any similarity between the movie Noah and the Noah of the Bible is purely coincidental. Why would you associate Noah the movie with Noah of the Bible when the movie has no bearing to the real story? Dont waste your money Reply D.S. says March 28 2014 at 627 am Every time Hollywood touches anything about the Bible it seems Christians get mad that ""Hollywood got it wrong again"" Like we should expect Hollywood to get the story right about a set of beliefs they dont want to even know about in truth One of the biggest horrors of the modern-day ""Christian"" church is that many even in the PULPIT have a hard time accepting the Bible as 100% true. I mean why follow a religion and deny its main tenants?? Why does anyone expect a person trying to make a profit to stick to just facts about this story? I havent read that the director is a practicing Chistian or Jew. I dont expect anything but a fantasy. and of course another attack at from what Ive studied the One True Way. Before the hate-emails amp; calls of ""arrogant intolerant"" whatever start up if your still reading this can you admit that MAYBE you dont know ALL there is to know in the universe I know I dont know it all. None of us do. Strange how were supposed to be supportive amp; tolerant of ALL no matter what. EXCEPT if your a Christian. Then its open season the world feels free to degrade look down at judge as crazyor worse ANYONE who calls themselves a follower of Christ. btw.... heres a quote from the article above-- .""Noah is lent several (huge) helping hands by the Watchers (the films version of the biblical Nephilim) fallen angels exiled to earth for their loyalty to mankind and imprisoned inside towering granite bodies that they lug about like walking mountains."" HERES the Truth- The Nephilim are hybrid fallen angel/humans who happen to be giants. they ARE NOT exiled for some loyalty. the dads are fallen angels chained up in ""Tartarus"" because they broke the rules amp; screwed human females. -- The offspring of these fallen angels/human women are called Nephilim. they happen to be HUGE. Theyre hybrids. Unnatural and an abomination. -- these hybrids spread out over the earth amp; demanded to be worshipped like gods. Thats why there are strange cave carvings monuments ancient statues all over the earth to ""different"" beings. like the long headed people in ancient Egypt human sacrifices in central amp; south America 100s of years ago. human -- these things showed up in ancient history all over the world. but nowdays that kinda story sounds like science-fiction. we chug our mocha-lattes amp; act like its all about us. big changes comin up Reply FrankNCents says March 27 2014 at 1055 pm Why does Noah scream with a ponderous British accent? Silly. Reply Noah says March 30 2014 at 902 pm Hate to tell you but not one person complained when the Ten Comandments or any from those eras were made. They were made with actual respect. I wouldnt comment and then speak for the reliegious demographic as if you actually know what goes on in their minds. Reply peterblood71 says March 27 2014 at 256 pm The trailers show the digital effects as looking just like digital effects which are getting boring as hell to look at. Its like admiring a pile of saran-wrapped plastic. Movies and great cable shows are about great character interplay story plot and all the things that ARENT visual effects. I never thought the day would come when VFX would contribute so little and detract so much. Reply leeeence says March 26 2014 at 1247 pm what a tedious and unnecessarily long review. and to what end? Reply shirleydaughteroftheking says March 26 2014 at 421 am Russell Crowe (ET online.com) said; ""The funny thing with people ya know they consider Noah to be a benevolent figure-you know-because he looked after the Animals. ""Awe Noah Noah and the animals."" Im like ""Are you kidding me This is the dude that stood by and watched the entire population of the planet...perish. Hes not benevolent hes not even nice."" At one point in the story his son says ""I thought you were chosen because you were good?"" and he goes ""I was chosen because I can get the job done"". So I think people are going to-...judging where peoples questions come from-... I think their gonna be quite surprised what Noah actually really means - What it means to really be in that position."" Would you let someone make a movie portraying your mother as a drunk and a whore? A then on top of that pay to go and see it? According to Answers In Genesis who has reviewed the pre-screened movie; 1.Methuselah is portrayed as a witch doctor. 2.Noah is like a crazy man more like worshiping the animals saying the animals are innocent and only they may reproduce after to flood. 3.Only one of Noahs sons wives get on the Ark.(which suggest that only one man and woman repopulated the earth after the flood.) 4.Tubalcain hides on the Ark. 5.Noah desires to kill all females who may repopulate the earth. Yet the Bible tells us that Noah was a Preacher of Righteousness for 120 years. He warned the people of the impending danger to come. They didnt have to miss the Boat. But like today they rejected God. The story of Noah is a story of Salvation and still today there is a boat Jesus Christ. Isaiah 556-13. I have been reading reviews and I came across this on imdb.com and this is their goal; ""I ... found very difficult to sympathize with Russell Crowes character. Especially when my 7 year old daughter whispered ""Noah is a very mean man Why does he want to kill the baby girls? Is he crazy dad?"" They are deliberately trying to push their propaganda on the masses and take our money at the same time. Its like Hitler behind the cammera wrecking truth and pouring out lies. The Bible tells us that the End of Times would be like the days of Noah before the flood. IT gives us signs of the coming judgment of God. Do you know what those signs are? see NoahTheMovie.com / ray comfort for answers. Reply Larry Molmud says March 25 2014 at 134 pm ""...strong initial worldwide B.O."" Sounds stinky.

Reply Patty Shenker says March 23 2014 at 449 pm I applaud Mr. Aronofsky amp; the other producers for using ONLY CGI animals amp; will not only see this film because of that but encourage others to do so too. Their using CGI animals instead of real animals who would have had to endure unimaginable cruelty amp; unnatural circumstances already makes them a true Noah- as they have saved them from the suffering associated with using them in entertainment and they have also modeled what films should be doing now- giving up the captivity the chains the cages the withholding of food amp; water the beatings amp; electrical shocks- to show how things should be done in this the 21st Century. The Hollywood Post writes- ""Among other criticisms are the implications that evolution and creation might be mutually inclusive and that man and beast are equal in the eyes of the Creator. Noah and his family are vegetarian and demonstrate respect for the Earths fragile balance."" Wow What a concept The truth is that animal agriculture is a major cause of climate change amp; thus floods hurricanes extreme weather water amp; grain scarcity amp; human starvation. This film is a story of biblical mythology but it more importantly is a message to us in this time and place. Reply Lunacy says March 25 2014 at 941 am I also think its great they went with CGI animals Patty. The entertainment industry REALLY needs to stop supporting the people who kill and take animals from their natural habitats just so they can make a buck. The film sounds terrific and Ill be there on opening weekend. Reply Ray Cdr says March 23 2014 at 1024 am This movie is almost sacrilegious to even watch Hollywood doesnt it get it We Christian folk are far more numerous then the lefty ilk they try to target to Also we tend to be far more loyal to a product then their lefty ilk If they truly saw that and let this movie be theyd make themselves a boat load of money in the process. But like all leftys theyre not to bright Look at the Mel Gibson movies BLOCK BUSTER HITS were they not? And his ""Passion of the Christ"" was produced with far less money I might also add his movie was as close to the Gospels as you could get. He didnt add this PC-lefty nonsense in it and it went on to a smashing success Wed not pay only pay outrageously exuberant prices for tickets at the movie theaters...... Wed even buy and rent some more of it when it comes out on DVD too With that Id like to explain something to you leftys and your lefty Hollywood ""For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these things God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book "" And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book."" --- Revelation 2218-19 Truth is what we live by Also ""Thou shalt have no other gods before me."" -- Exodus 203 SO whos the ""god"" of this movie? Because it most certainly isnt the God of the Bible Hollywood you mind as well count this movie to your massive list of BOMBS too Like what all leftys do in blaming others when their goofy ideas BOMB look to see Paramount blame Christian folk for this movies failure.

Reply FrankNCents says March 29 2014 at 1005 pm Wrong. Noah was given seven laws. They even have a name The Seven Noahide Laws (also The Seven Laws of Noah). Adam was given six laws. The addion law given to Noah was ""not to tear the flesh if a living Adam was given six laws. The generations of Adam to Noah were vegetarians. The seventh law deals with animal slaughter. Setting up courts was common to Adam and to Noah. These seven laws commanded to Noah were reaffirmed at Sinai. The details and performances of these laws were entrusted to the sages of Israel to adjudicate and interpret. At the End of Days everyone will be judged as to whether or not they kept these simple laws in addition to approximately another 30 common sense laws (such as respect for mother and father being charitable protecting the orphan and widow and so on). Observing the laws properly gains an individual a share in the afterlife ""The righteous of all nations have a share in the world to come."" Daniel Shafner says March 29 2014 at 931 pm News flash Jews have 613 commandments to follow. Non Jews have the Seven Noahide Laws. See that word ""Noahide""? These laws are commended to Noah and all Mankind will be judged on whether or not they kept these laws. In total it works out to approximately 35 laws including the seven laws. Okay? You have absolutely no command of this subject do instead of trying to correct me ask and learn or at least remain silent. gt; Jacob Greenwood says March 29 2014 at 907 pm There were passed down in scrolls and carvings.. The first person Adam could read and write he was taught. Remember in Genesis how God wants to hear the names Adam chooses for animals etc. Obviously he could speak a language. Every first born wrote the Chronicles of their lives. The Book of Enoch is one example. The book of Adam gave the six laws. Noah added the seventh to make a system of just courts. Torah leaves much out. You must remember Moses is raised Egyptian. Kinda like a Catholic who converts to Judiasm but still has an affinity for Christmas trees (so to say) Mosesknew the BS of Paganryso was overly strict because he didnt trust people so knowledge was hidden. Do you know that many Jews left Egypt for Mycaenae and other places where they had family. Not everyone went into the desert. Its so much more than we think we know.. Scott says March 23 2014 at 1214 pm Because they cant. Its a fairy tale. Reply Azznerak says March 22 2014 at 100 pm The only reason Christians will go see the movie will to see if they promote Christianity to the level they feel is acceptable. They wont go see it for the story or the actors or to have a good time but only to judge and nit-pick. Reply LuLu says March 22 2014 at 1216 pm If the movie director could make it extravagant just think how ""over the top"" God made it when He was directing the real thing. Dont you think its time God was given the credit? And God made Russell Crow to be the ""hunk"" that he is.

Laughable Reply Johanne T. says March 21 2014 at 235 pm Well in the Bible (not sure if in the film) Noahs three sons become the propagators of the worlds races. Shem was the forefather of the Semites Ham was the forefather of the Africans and Japheth was I presume the father of the Caucasians. Perhaps they didnt include Asians and American Indians because when the tale was recorded centuries before our era the people in Judea and Israel werent really familiar with them. Reply ALBERT says March 22 2014 at 719 pm You are saying mostly correct but you are wrong on the Asians. After their children dispersed to different areas of the world their looks also changed.

If Russell Crowe is as good this reviewer seems to think Ill be happy to see him receive some kudos. Its been a while since weve seen him at his best in a film. And I hope people wont pick apart the movie on religious grounds or based on Biblical details. Its NOT a documentary; with such a sparse story the moviemakers have to create and embellish the story. Reply Nemoque says March 21 2014 at 1100 am Every time that Hollywood tries to improve on a biblical story it screws it up. This movie despite all the wonderful special effects or choreography will fail on all accounts. For those that have actually read the biblical account of Noah the movie will disappoint because it misses the entire theme of the story. It has NOTHING to do with environmentalism. For the Atheist any mention of God is anathema. Reply Alric the Red says March 21 2014 at 1229 pm It sounds to me like theyve improved on the story. A lot. I mean the original Bible story is sparse as the review noted. To render it at all beyond its dull Sunday-school tale will require a bit of artistic license. The movie sounds very compelling to me told in as realistic a way as possible. I definitely like the touch of adding an orphan girl into the mix thereby explaining who Noahs sons were to mate with without an incestuous solution. And the Nephilim who are mentioned only in passing coming in to assist Noah was a very deft way to introduce the more exotic and often ignored mythological elements to the story. This looks to be one awesome movie. Reply Jessica Porong says March 21 2014 at 1152 am I have to agree with you Im tired of Hollywood pooping on God like they fear man more than they fear God himself theres many things I already dont agree in the films synopsis like 1 why did they have to make him drugged; instead of the mighty power of God speaking to him through intense prayer or dream 2 none of the women had problems having children and it was a command after the flood for Noah and his wife to continually reproduce alone with his sons and their wives 3 Noah was a drunk pre-flood and God never had a problem with that because he was a man that God has hope in 4 why at the end they had to have Noah curse God after saving and blessing him. I think its sick how the world thinks God blesses and then the world turns around to smack him how sad Reply jack vance says March 21 2014 at 1212 pm I think it is a sign of respect that he never takes G__s name in vane. The true name is sacred and unleashes powerful forces too strong for mention is secular literature.

Daily Edition Login to download Noah Film Review 1000 PM PDT 3/20/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Before Paul Ehrlich and Al Gore there was Noah. TWITTER Russell Crowe stars in Darren Aronofskys Bible-based epic. Darren Aronofsky wrestles one of scriptures most primal stories to the ground and extracts something vital and audacious while also pushing some aggressive environmentalism in Noah. Whereas for a century most Hollywood filmmakers have tread carefully and respectfully when tackling biblical topics in big-budget epics aimed at a mass audience Aronofsky has been daring digging deep to develop a bold interpretation of a tale which in the original offers a lot of room for speculation and invention. The narrative of the global flood that wiped out almost all earthly life is the original disaster story one thats embraced by most of the major world religions which means that conservative and literal-minded elements of all faiths who make it their business to be offended by untraditional renditions of holy texts will find plenty to fulminate about here. Already banned in some Middle Eastern countries Noah will rile some for the complete omission of the name ""God"" from the dialogue others for its numerous dramatic fabrications and still more for its heavy-handed ecological doomsday messages which unmistakably mark it as a product of its time. But whether you buy these elements or not this is still an arresting piece of filmmaking that has a shot at capturing a large international audience both for its fantasy-style spectacle and its fresh look at an elemental Bible story most often presented as a kiddie yarn. PHOTOS Noahs Berlin Premiere Emma Watson Jennifer Connelly Douglas Booth Flood the Red Carpet The director/co-writer serves notice of his revisionism right away mutating the opening line of Genesis into ""In the beginning there was nothing."" In the Bibles ark story God does most of the talking whereas here Noah does at one point raging at the silent one he only calls the Creator ""Why do you not answer me?"" This Noah who receives his instructions about what to do from disturbing quasi-hallucinatory visions is presented as the last good man on Earth the chosen one who will preserve the worlds life forms along with his immediate family while the wicked will be swept away forcing humanity to make a fresh start. One of the striking things about the Noah tale is that it presents a fallible Creator one who admits to disappointments over shortcomings in the product of the sixth day of creation with the remark ""I will blot out man whom I have created from the face of the ground man and beast and creeping things and birds of the air for I am sorry that I have made them."" The exceptions are middle-aged Noah (Russell Crowe) his wife Naameh (Jennifer Connelly) and sons Shem (Douglas Booth) Ham (Logan Lerman) and Japheth (Leo Carroll) who are estranged from the rest of humanity and live apart from it struggling to survive in forbidding surroundings. Noahs physical and mental toughness is strengthened by an abiding faith and Crowes splendidly grounded work here recalls some of his finest earlier performances notably in Gladiator The Insider and Cinderella Man in which he embodied values of tenacity trustworthiness and resourcefulness that inspired confidence that his characters would do the right thing. To be sure this is not the genial grandfatherly Noah charmingly evoked by John Huston when he led an orderly assemblage of animals into the ark two-by-two in his 1965 epic The Bible. Crowes Noah is a fighter a survivalist and yet a tortured man dismayed by the ruin brought upon the land by the others of his species. In a visit with his ancient grandfather Methuselah (Anthony Hopkins) the men agree that ""Its men who broke the world"" and that as a result the Creator will destroy it. Foraging with one of his sons Noah instructs ""We only collect what we need what we can use."" For many today this sort of environmental back-to-the-earth religion has replaced the old-fashioned kind with nonbelievers as shunned and disdained by the faithful as heathens once were by the righteous. Working on by far his biggest budget in the wake of the great global success of Black Swan Aronofsky bulks up his film not only with naturalistic spectacle but with fantastical elements that evoke both Ray Harryhausen and Peter Jackson; creatures rise up from the sea a whole forest takes instantaneous shape at Noahs convenience and there is far more swordplay and fighting than one ever imagined in this story. But by far the most startling apparition in this context are the Watchers the so-called Nephilim or fallen angels only glancingly mentioned in the Bible. Here they take the form of giant ferocious-looking rock people (given great gravelly voice by Nick Nolte Mark Margolis and Frank Langella no less) who not only come to Noahs aid by doing the heavy lifting in building the ark but cut down stomp on and otherwise decimate the hordes who eventually besiege the ark in hopes of climbing aboard at the last minute. STORY Paramount Denies Report That Pope Canceled Meeting With Noahs Russell Crowe Leading this army of outcasts and misfits the very people the Creator has deemed unworthy of continued existence is the formidably nefarious Tubal-cain (Ray Winstone) who more than lives up to his heritage as the descendent of the worlds first murderer. He also becomes the worlds first stowaway his secret presence aboard the ark eventually provoking a profound crisis that helps widen the rift through the once tightly-knit but now fraught family. Like previous Noahs this one embraces the massive responsibility of sustaining life on Earth. But one of the ways this film takes the character deeper is forcing upon him certain monumental moral decisions that in the absence of direct word from above hes got to make himself. Drawing often painful conclusions based on thinking through his ""visions"" as best he can Noah prohibits any other humans from boarding the ark and in the process forever alienates his middle son Ham who is angry because he believes hes destined never to know a woman whereas his older brother Shem has Ila (Emma Watson) an orphan the family took in years earlier. When the barren Ila miraculously becomes pregnant Noahs absolutist interpretation of what he must do prefigures Abraham creating a terrible family schism that sets even his wife against him startlingly so given how close the couple has always been. Crowe and Connelly were paired before in A Beautiful Mind and their rapport is manifest in the intimate bond one feels between their characters here. If anything the animals get short shrift here. Noah never has to go out and gather them; hundreds of them just show up as if theyd experienced the same vision as Noahs push aboard the waiting ark and promptly go to sleep not to reawaken or be seen again until the voyage is done. This not only comes off as something of a cheat -- after all its always interesting and fun to examine the occupants of the worlds first and most famous temporary zoo especially given some of the fanciful and/or extinct critters the filmmakers ever-so-briefly put on show here -- but its also a convenient way to avoid the dilemma of explaining how the animals got along so well for the duration without eating each other. STORY Noah World Premiere in Mexico City Gets Mixed Reception Foreground family melodrama takes precedence over the voyage itself in the final stretch; other than for Ilas pregnancy and the growth of Noahs hair from unlikely buzz-cut to a shaggier look there is no indication how long theyre at sea no sense of the floods duration or the passage of time. Noahs ultimate sense of having failed in his mission feels off-kilter given the overriding theme of providing the world with a fresh start as does the inevitable question of with whom exactly Noahs heirs are supposed to repopulate the land. (Monty Python would have a good answer for this one.) The ark was built of all places on a 5-acre grassy field in a state park in Oyster Bay Long Island and there is no faulting the films outstanding technical achievement. Production designer Mark Friedberg came up with a boxy barge-like conception for the ark rather than the more conventional bowed vessel and its rough-hewn homemade look is entirely of a piece with the rugged overall approach. Varied Icelandic landscapes provide fantastic backdrops for much of the early action. Some of Michael Wilkinsons costumes trend noticeably toward the modern while Matthew Libatiques muscular cinematography seamlessly incorporates live-action and abundant CGI elements. Clint Mansells score is entirely in sync with the directors intentions which means that it repeatedly crosses the line between the intensely dramatic and the bombastic.

Darren Aronofskys ""Noah"" paradoxically embodies both of these perspectives. The directors murky ill-conceived take on the worlds oldest disaster story contains some of the most pristine visuals produced on a mass studio scale in some time. But its also constantly tethered to a dull melodramatic series of events out of whack with any traditional interpretation of the material. By turning the monolithic odyssey into a sword-and-sandals showdown with occasionally cosmic tangents the 137-minute studio venture contains the glimmers of a truly visionary achievement flooded by half-baked ideas. While ""Noah"" takes plenty of liberties with the source material the fundamentals remain intact -- even viewers oblivious to Sunday school teachings know the gist Noah (Russell Crowe) is the sole do-gooder in a spare world dominated by corruption the last line of innocence descended from Seth while Cains hedonist offspring populate the Earth. In a vision Noah learns that ""the Creator"" intends to destroy all mankind with a catastrophic flood; only Noah his family and two pairs of nearly every other species on Earth may survive -- for the time being at least --  by riding it out in a giant hunk of wood. Using this foundation however Aronofsky and co-writer Ari Handel pepper the story with a number of flashier ingredients some fairly routine and others less so. These include Noahs hulking army of four-armed rock giants an elaboration on the fallen angels known as Nephilim who initially resist Noahs cries for help and eventually aid in the construction of the Ark; the screenwriters also give Noah a single antagonist in the form of the scheming Tubal-Cain (Ray Winstone) who manages to wind up as the Arks sole human stowaway and attempt to surpass even the will of the Creator to restart civilization. While still sifting through the meaning of his vision Noah receives advice from his ancient grandfather Methusaleh (Anthony Hopkins scowling and smirking in a handful of scenes) while keeping his blandly anxious wife (Jennifer Connelly) at bay. The couples children include the eternally worried Ila (Emma Watson) and Shem (Douglas Booth) who eventually fall into a perilous romance as well as Ham (Logan Lerman) whose allegiances to his father grow increasingly dubious as the plans for the Ark take shape. Unfortunately few of these elements contain even a modicum of surprise. Nobody in ""Noah"" ever says the word ""god"" which makes sense for a movie so firmly grounded in earthly traditions and that only manages to amaze when it deviates from its monotonous core. Unlike Aronofskys last troubled production ""The Fountain"" theres a constant feeling that the director is resisting the material weighing down his ambition. One needs to look no further than the embellished form of Tubal-Cain a hackneyed villain prone to growling his simplistic intentions with the formulaic routine of a wind-up plot device (""Kill the giants. Kill Noah. Take the Ark.""). Seemingly there to balance off the storys more spectacular tangents the simplistic villain epitomizes many of the bigger shortcomings throughout ""Noah"" a ponderous score that overstates every dramatic moment; stagey showdowns between virtually every member of the cast; monochromatic costumes and pale backdrops of empty jungles and muddy fields that look like the idiots guide to biblical milieu. All the same its virtually impossible to disregard the profound moving images that burst through Aronofksys cluttered narrative. Noahs early dream visions include snippets of the horrors yet to come interspersed with glimpses of the forbidden fruit and threaded together with a speedy rhythm reminiscent of the drug sequences in the directors ""Requiem for a Dream."" Later he outdoes any isolated moment of graphic inspiration from ""The Fountain"" with a tantalizing outline of the creation story from the big bang to the birth of life. The jittery CGI imagery produced by the ever-reliable team at Industrial Light amp; Magic suggest ""The Tree of Life"" on Adderall -- as the montage speeds from the dark void of space to the progression of sea animals onto land the cycle is overwhelming in its relentless complexity. Later onboard the Ark Noah tracks the progress of civilization by starting with the story of Adam and Eve represented by golden figures in the Garden of Eden and the motions of silhouettes against a pink sky to illustrate the passage of violence across generations. Such transfixing moments are sufficient to make one wish the unwieldy main scenario receded to the background. Instead no matter how many compelling images Aronofsky and longtime cinematographer Matthew Libatique offer up ""Noah"" remains tethered to its cold plot. During the final act as Noah devolved into a crazy-eyed zealot driven to murderous extremes by his convictions the movie plunges into a mishmash of suspense and melodrama that suggests a crisis of faith in the material not unlike the one plaguing the characters. The script never musters the same depth afforded its effects Though it places the concept front and center ""Noah"" hardly engages with the struggle to negotiate between free will and a higher calling with much subtlety (Sample dialogue ""Whats good? Whats right? That choice is yours."") Despite its thundering delusions of grandeur ideologically speaking ""Noah"" is just plain dumb. Nevertheless theres a fascinating uneasiness to the movie that makes it stand out from countless blockbusters. Its simple enough to imagine the identity of the proverbial Creator as no less than Aronofsky himself whose struggles with Paramount over this supremely eccentric take on an overexposed drama have been widely publicized. Short of transforming Noah into an antediluvian Captain America there may be no better process of enlivening this seminal archaic tale. ""Noah"" wrestles with the material from nearly every direction. Libatiques camerawork oscillates from an intimate shaky cam approach to astounding crane shots worthy of a classic Cecil B. DeMille saga. And even he would never have been able to achieve something on the scale of one memorable shot that manages to capture the Ark from above while the animated Nephilim continue their construction efforts on the expansive roof and thousands of virtual animals stream into the vessel many cubits below. Sadly these tantalizing ingredients are adrift in a sea of lesser subplots. Aronofsky has gone on the record as taking full responsibility for the theatrical cut of ""Noah"" but he deserves more credit for pulling it through the commercial system than for the actual quality that came out the other end. The very existence of this abnormal big budget venture was mandated by the unexpected worldwide success of ""Black Swan"" another screwy project thats at least more in command of its undulating moods. But ""Black Swan"" was never intended to take the form of a mainstream blockbuster. ""Noah"" struggles to meet those standards while showing evidence of better pathways left unexplored. Its something of a cautionary tale about the dangers of supposed autonomy promised by commercial success. Aronofskys worst movie is an epic misfire that like the source material offers plenty of lessons even if you dont buy the whole package. Criticwire Grade C HOW WILL IT PLAY? A tough sell for both religious and secular audiences ""Noah"" could manage a solid box office performance during its initial weekend due the lack of major competition (as well as the studios careful overseas rollout strategy). But its unlikely to remain a major player as summer blockbuster season starts to take shape in the coming weeks.

I left the theatre nonplussed. I came to my favorite critic to see what he thought. I agree with much of your interpretation. The one thing you didnt touch on is Noahs basic struggle to balance work and family. Its a simple concept but I found it to be the most relatable aspect of the film. If you get past all the FX and terribly hackneyed plot-lines.dialogue I think its a decent story about a man learning to balance love and duty.... That being said I thought that on the whole the picture is an underachiever... and that scene at the end of Russel Crowe on the beach making wine is pure schlock. Reply Hell Yeah May 12 2016 1214 pm I agree with Glorified. Its amazing how every single review from the Times to Globe to Mr. Kohns here goes out of there way with kid gloves to politely state that this film is a mess and embarrassingly amateurish. Why? Is Aronofsky a sacred cow? With the exception of some good moments by Rourke and Tomei in The Wrestler his films are generally shallow derivative and pretentious exercises. Reply Gorified May 12 2016 1214 pm I dont think Ive seen a film with such bad reviews spun in such a positive way. Do they think we were born yesterday?

Reply Adam May 12 2016 1214 pm I think you read this movie too narrowly. Reply Kevin S May 12 2016 1214 pm I find it strange with this lengthy review not once does Mr. Kohn address Russell Crowes performance. A performance whether good or bad I am sure dominates the running time of the movie amp; obviously should have been mentioned in some regard. Usually such an important part of a film the lead actor or actress defines a major part of the quality of the film. Other roles in the movie were given some type of small critique. I realize that film is a directors forum amp; thats why most of the review centers on Aronofskys vision but in the future there could be a mention about the performance of the actor or actress at that center. Reply Alric the Red May 12 2016 1214 pm Where are the trailers for this movie? Granted I dont watch a lot of TV but usually I see trailers for some movie or other when I do. Whats up? Reply Sylvia May 12 2016 1214 pm Dear Indiewire Can you please hire a copyeditor or teach your writers how to edit their work? I enjoy reading here but it seems like almost every article I read contains at least one (if not more) grammatical error misspelling or typo to the point that I sometimes find it hard to take you seriously as a publication. For example the sentence below has all three mistakes And even he would [have] never been able to achieve something on the scale of one memorable shot that mangoes [manages Im assuming] to capture the Ark from above while the animated nephillim [Nephilim spelled correctly has only one L and should be capitalized as it is a proper noun] continue their construction efforts... Reply Guest May 12 2016 1214 pm Its good that Noah stars at least two Jewish actors (Jennifer Connelly whose mother is Jewish and Logan Lerman who is just Jewish). Reply Nick May 12 2016 1214 pm Full of spoilers Thanks so much. Next time review without telling key plot points of the story. Reply JC May 12 2016 1214 pm How can there be controversy?

I dont watch too much TV but I havent seen one TV trailer for this film. I havent seen much buzz about it on the internet (even on film sites) since the controversy about final cut came up months ago. You cant expect many people to see a presumptive blockbuster without it being sold as such. Hell I havent seen it publicized to indie levels in months. I feel like Paramount would rather bury it and eat the loss rather than promote something this potentially controversial. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.
