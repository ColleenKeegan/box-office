By J.R. Jones Jr_Jones Edge of Tomorrow Edge of Tomorrow  Directed by Doug Liman Last Thursday Tom Cruise made a surprise appearance at Showplace ICON theaters for a preview screening of his latest blockbuster Edge of Tomorrow. When a huge star like that walks into a theater full of fans theres a sort of convulsion as people shriek and leap to their feet; its pretty exciting even if you dont share in the hysteria. Cruise gave a little spiel for the movie posed for a photograph with the whole audience standing behind him and soon split. He did make one interesting comment before he left noting that he loves movies so much he watches one every day. That couch-jumping enthusiasm is the reason people still like Cruise even after three decades in the spotlight have turned him into a rather eccentric character. Few stars of his caliber have been treated with such condescension in the press yet a quick scan of Cruises filmography turns up plenty of great performances as the cynical con artist in Rain Man (1988) the sexually restless married man in Eyes Wide Shut (1999) the cock-strutting motivational speaker in Magnolia (1999) the ice-cold hit man in Collateral (2004). Check out the already forgotten political drama Lions for Lambs (2007) if you want to see Cruise playing a smooth Republican senator steal a movie from Meryl Streep and Robert Redford. And what other handsome leading man has taken on more batshit-weird roles from the vulgar movie executive in Tropic Thunder (2008) to the conflicted Nazi colonel in Valkyrie (2008) to the vain hair-metal god in Rock of Ages (2012)? Cruises bread and butter though has always been the big summer movie and Edge of Tomorrow is his second sci-fi adventure in a row following last summers Oblivion. After a meteor hits Germany Europe is overrun by giant beasts that look like a cross between an octopus and a bramble bush and Cruise plays a military press attache forced into combat as British and U.S. forces stage a sort of Normandy landing in France. ""What day is it?"" he asks his commanding officer. ""For you Judgment Day"" the officer cracks. On the contrary its actually Groundhog Day when Cruise is killed in action he goes into a time loop and relives the same day over and over again until he and Emily Blunt playing a millennial Joan of Arc called ""the Angel of Verdun"" can find a route to victory against the aliens. Time-travel movies are almost a genre unto themselves and this particular gimmick of incessantly reliving the same day has already been incorporated into one thriller the much superior Source Code (2011). Edge of Tomorrow is a decent time waster but if youre the sort of person who watches a movie every day you should probably look for something better. I would hate to get caught in a loop and have to watch this thing a hundred times.

Nor does his day get any better blown to smithereens run over by a jeep shot in the head--you name it he suffers it. Forget last weeks critically reviled Seth MacFarlane comedy-western. Its Cruises film that might all too plausibly have been titled A Million Ways to Die in the Future.Related Story X-Men A Blast From the Past (and Future) If youve read anything at all about Edge of Tomorrow it is likely that two of the words youve read have been ""Groundhog Day"" and theres good reason for this. Director Doug Limans sharp infectiously entertaining sci-fi thriller offers a lethal spin on Harold Ramiss 1993 high-concept comedy Rather than overcome existential ennui a la Bill Murrays Phil Connors Cage must embrace the certainty that before his very long day ends--if in fact it ever does--he is certain to die many many more times in many many more ways.To rewind a bit Edge of Tomorrow (based on the Japanese novel All You Need Is Kill) is set in a near-future in which a methodical alien species dubbed ""Mimics"" has touched down in Germany and over the course of five years gradually overtaken most of Western Europe. The sole human victory over the invaders has been at Verdun--yes that Verdun--where a heroic soldier in a robotic exoskeleton Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) single-handedly killed more than 100 Mimics and in the process became an icon of the resistance.Enter Cruises character the callow William Cage. When first we meet him he is an Army major a principal TV spokesman for the war effort and an exceptional coward. But after an ill-considered run-in with a superior officer he finds himself demoted sent to the frontlines and soon enough accidentally imbued with the peculiar ability to reset his day the moment he dies. From there the general contours of the plot are largely set By a process of trial and (inevitably lethal) error Cage must find a way to defeat the Mimics learning more and making it slightly farther with each attempt. Hes aided in his efforts by Vrataski the ""Angel of Verdun"" who has her own insights into the nature of his powers.The conceit may sound constricting but Liman (like Ramis before him) gets exceptional mileage out of it. The director is in top form here presenting his ever-revolving tale with visual style narrative velocity and a wonderful dose of dark humor. There are echoes of Cruises last sci-fi outing the less-bad-than-its-remembered Oblivion and still more of Duncan Joness excellent 2011 time-travel whodunit Source Code. But Liman (Go The Bourne Identity Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith) lends the proceedings a more playful edge and directs the action sequences with true panache. The early battle scenes on the beach in particular are a riveting ballet of blood and sand and fire and metal. (And aliens.) And despite the inevitable inanities underlying its time-travel premise the movie does a relatively good job of adhering to its own internal logic.The director is in top form here presenting his ever-revolving tale with visual style narrative velocity and a wonderful dose of dark humor.Blunt offers a clearer display of the big-screen charisma she hinted at way back in The Devil Wears Prada than she has at perhaps any time since. Moreover the film is a nice exception to the customary damsel-in-distress narrative this time out its Blunt who plays the battle-hardened vet.Cruise too is better than hes been in a long while. As an actor hes always relied overmuch on sheer intensity a fiercer stare a sharper grin a more zealous commitment to performing his own stunts. But under Limans direction he takes it easier--at least on occasion--than he has in years. Having experimented with broad comedy (Tropic Thunder Rock of Ages) following the couch-jumping-and-Scientology derailment of his superstardom he offers flashes here of a quieter more ironic wit. There are even a few moments of understated tenderness (two words rarely associated with Cruise) between him and Blunt.In its final act unfortunately Limans movie veers a bit off course. To belabor the analogy If the first three quarters of the film reinvent Groundhog Day the final quarter recalls ever so slightly the saggy conclusion of Stripes. (The script went through many iterations and the ending was reportedly always considered problematic.)That said Edge of Tomorrow remains one of the pleasant surprises of this summer season to date boasting magnetic leads a wickedly looping plot and bravura direction. It might not be quite the cinematic experience you want to re-live over and over again but its well worth at least one go-round.

Twitter previousThe NSA Could Actually Spy on More Phone Calls Under Reform BillnextThe U.S. Economy Finally Hit a Historic Milestone--and It Doesnt Matter Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

"Edge of Tomorrow starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Watching Tom Cruise Get Wasted by Aliens Over and Over Again--Actually Quite Entertaining Watching Tom Cruise Get Wasted by Aliens Over and Over Again--Actually Quite Entertaining Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 6 2014 356 PM Edge of Tomorrow Watch out for that alien tentacle--its a doozy By David Haglund Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures As you may have heard the new Tom Cruise movie is basically an alien-invasion Groundhog Day in which our hero must live the same day over and over again trying to do it a little better each time. But whereas the Harold Ramis-Bill Murray classic is a comic meditation on getting over yourself and learning to appreciate life Edge of Tomorrow is about something else making action movies. David Haglund David Haglund is the literary editor of NewYorker.com. It begins with the sort of montage youve seen in a million other Hollywood blow-em-ups particularly post-9/11 a series of clips from faux-news broadcasts which quickly convey that in this version of the near-future a mysterious alien race that looks like the demon spawn of the Flying Spaghetti Monster has invaded the Earth and rapidly annihilated much of it. Europe in particular is a bloody mess. In a few of these clips we see a military spokesman named William Cage (Cruise) who looks like the slick propagandist that he is. You may recognize him from the many other films in which Tom Cruise has played a callow hustler of one kind or another from The Color of Money to Rain Man to Jerry Maguire. The most obvious precedent is Lt. Daniel Kaffee the Navy lawyer from A Few Good Men who like Cage begins his movie hoping to avoid real work or risky entanglements. Cages Colonel Jessup is Gen. Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) British leader of the United Defense Force the international military effort to thwart the extraterrestrials. He orders Cage to the front with a camera crew the better to sell his impending D-Day-like invasion of alien-dominated France to a worldwide audience of potential recruits. When Cage refuses and then runs--Tom Cruise does like to run--Brigham has him handcuffed and shipped to the front with new orders to join the squad of grunts who will storm the beach first and surely be slaughtered. He shortly is. Advertisement And then he wakes up back at the base in handcuffs experiencing the previous day all over again Phil Connors-like. How or why this is happening is not clear at first but on one of his repeat trips to the invasion Cage finds the Virgil who can guide him through this hell Rita Vrataski a legendary UDF soldier called the Angel of Verdun because of her miraculous feats of alien-killing in that old French city best known for a brutal WWI battle. Rita--the name as Manohla Dargis points out may be a nod to Andie MacDowells character in Groundhog Day--is played by Emily Blunt whose surprising performance as an utterly convincing badass may be the best thing about this movie. Vrataski too had a period of chronic do-overs and unlike Cage she knows why It has to do with those murderous extraterrestrials called (for reasons that were never quite clear to me) Mimics. They can control time and because Cage killed one of the ""Alpha"" Mimics that time control was passed on to him. He now has the power to ""reset the day."" Perhaps the speculative biology and metaphysics of all this is clearer in All You Need Is Kill the illustrated Japanese novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka that Edge of Tomorrow is based on. In the movie though its just graspable enough for you to focus on what really matters watching Tom Cruise get killed over and over and over again. Vrataski takes Cage under her wing--or rather under her giant weaponized cricket bat--and schools him in the art of near-future warfare. Then they attempt to memorize the events of the beach invasion so that they can duck and weave and kill their way to the lead alien beast a kind of central brain that as we learn in a looong scene of exposition directly controls the littler creepy-crawlies causing all the carnage across the continent. If that sounds like a video game it should. Sakurazakas novel was inspired by playing one and Edge of Tomorrow is essentially a cinematic version of Halo in which a single player gets unlimited lives so that he can learn to dodge all the enemies and win the game. That repetition would get tedious if not for the comic brio that Cruise and director Doug Liman bring to the butchery Again and again Cage tries and fails to dodge some weapon or vehicle or alien tendril and amusingly goes down. Top Comment Tom Cruise killed over and over and over and ... While I dont condone killing I have a say it couldnt happen to a better actor.  More... -BashfulBilly Join In This practice-makes-perfect routine looks a lot like an actor rehearsing his stunts--and as Cruise is fond of reminding us he does his own stunts. This is surely not a coincidence Liman and his screenwriters have built in enough nods to other movies--Groundhog Day Alien Saving Private Ryan and so on--to make clear that the meta-ness is the point. This is a movie about Tom Cruise working very very hard to please the world. And please me he did though I was already a fan. Not that the pleasure was particularly profound Despite the movies allusions to World Wars I and II Edge of Tomorrow is utterly shallow when it comes to war giving us an inhuman enemy we are never asked to understand and a small cast of fellow soldiers who are mostly forgettable. Lately it seems we dont expect anything more from a Tom Cruise movie Hes taken on a string of big-budget crowd-pleasing action flicks after avoiding them for most of his career. Watching his physically expert but psychologically thin performance in this one its hard not to feel as though he too is caught in a time loop of sorts doing variations on the same thing over and over--and getting very good at it but with much less than the fate of humanity at stake.

"Edge of Tomorrow (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Edge of Tomorrow (PG-13) A likable Tom Cruise is game in this flawed sci-fi adventure. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com6/5/2014 Editor rating 2 In Edge of Tomorrow Tom Cruise tackles the sort of character we rarely see him portray A clueless wimp. Hes surprisingly good at it too. In the future as mankind is fighting off an alien invasion that has taken down most of the eastern hemisphere Cruise plays William Cage a U.S. Army Major whose primary job is to go on TV put a positive spin on bad news with that million-watt smile issue press releases on how well the effort is going and sit down for talk shows to assure the public that although the world is at stake the government has our backs. Then a general (Brendan Gleeson) tired of hearing him talk demotes Cage to private and ships him off to the front line -- specifically Normandy Beach the last foothold before the monsters take over for good and train their sights on North America. Cruise used to playing cocky know-it-all guys who rarely break a sweat is amusing to watch insisting there must have been some mistake as hes outfitted in an exoskeleton loaded with weaponry a powerful gun that he doesnt know how to fire and is dropped out of an airplane into the midst of the gigantic battle where he is killed almost instantly. That sounds horrible but its actually funny because Doug Liman directs each of those deaths with the speed and surprise of a Road Runner cartoon with Cruise as the Coyote. And its rare to see the actor take on a character who is this far out of his element (he usually plays experts).  When was the last time you heard a befuddled Cruise ask ""How do you fire this thing?"" Then the storys hook which is based on a novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka kicks in. A moment after his death Cage wakes up exactly at the same military base on the same morning when he was dropped off. No one seems to recognize him or know that he was just there. Instead everything repeats itself a la Groundhog Day and soon hes back on the battlefield still fiddling with his guns sticky safety switch. He gets killed again. Repeat. The first half of Edge of Tomorrow which has some ferocious action and aliens that bear a distracting resemblance to the tentacled creatures in the Matrix trilogy is clever and inventive as far as summer blockbusters go. Every day that Cruise goes back into battle he already knows whats going to happen so hes able to make a little progress each time. Hes helped by the unstoppable Rita (Emily Blunt) a soldier so tough she doesnt even wear a helmet who decides to help the poor schlub with his training. But then the movie starts getting into trouble. In the hilarious Groundhog Day all Bill Murray wanted to do was to win the girl. In Edge of Tomorrow Cruise must save the world which requires him to become Top Gun-era Tom Cruise again pull off an impossible mission and retrieve a blue orb from the bottom of the now-submerged Louvre. That scene unfortunately conjures flashbacks to The Da Vinci Code something every film should try to avoid whenever possible. After such a promising start Edge of Tomorrow reverts to the usual formula of huge special effects and a race toward a specific target that must be destroyed in order to kill all the aliens at once (why do invading extra-terrestrials always bring with them the single thing that can wipe them out? Couldnt they have hid it on Jupiter or something?) The structure of Edge of Tomorrow is curiously similar to Oblivion whose first near-plotless hour was intriguing and then came the bad guys and ruined everything. Ill bet you can barely remember that one and a year from now Edge of Tomorrow will sound like the title of a new series on Lifetime. You have to give it up for Cruise though. Heres a superstar who takes every project with the same level of intensity even a big entertainment such as this one. He tears through large action setpieces with a believable ferocity sells you on them even when the CGI is a little shaky and his enthusiasm wins you over. Edge of Tomorrow isnt good but its also forgivable. Just please stop the Top Gun 2 rumors Tom. Please. Cast Tom Cruise Emily Blunt Brendan Gleeson Bill Paxton John Armstrong Tony Way. Director Doug Liman. Screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth John-Henry Butterworth. Based on the novel ""All You Need is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. A Warner Bros. release.

"Die Another Day << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Map of the Stars  Next How to Watch the World Cup Like a True Soccer Nerd Facebook Twitter Print Movies Die Another Day Tom Cruise is unkillable in Edge of Tomorrow; Shailene Woodley radiantly incurable in The Fault in Our Stars by Wesley Morris on June 6 2014 Whos 3-D IMAXier than Tom Cruise? You can rattle off names but youre wasting your time because theres one answer nobody. I mean there are stars taller than he is. Theres King Kong and Godzilla and Marvel too -- I guess. But you dont even need IMAX for Tom Cruise. His grin is 72x54 feet and practically chattering on your lap. The screen itself is an occupational necessity. Trust me if Cruise could knock on your door and do his job at your kitchen table he would. And dont think for a second that some start-up isnt hunkered down in Mountain View working on a solution for that one. In the meantime thank god for digital reproduction right? The thrill of a movie like Edge of Tomorrow is in watching a star appear fully high on himself. No one is a bigger Tom Cruise junkie than Tom Cruise. He makes the Robert Downey Juniors and Matthew McConaugheys of the world look like Walter Cronkite. Were talking about something greater than egotism. Were talking a total and utter desperation to please. This time Cruise has sprinted the extra block to ensure that even his haters go home happy. In Edge of Tomorrow he keeps dying over and over jarringly hilariously triumphantly. The movie which Doug Liman directed takes perverse pleasure in knocking him off then reviving him. Each time Cruise jolts awake you get a jolt too -- unless youre a hater in which case all you get to do for almost two hours is suck your teeth. But the movie knows youre out there too For death no. 1 Cruises face melts through his skull. The excuse for the flesh sizzling is apocalyptic world war. Metallic-amphibious aliens dubbed Mimics have invaded Earth. Humanity teeters on ye olde brink of annihilation. And the planets nations have banded together as a combat complex called the United Defense Force. One of its generals a big humorless Irishman played by Brendan Gleeson informs Major William Cage (Cruise) that hell be suiting up and going to war. Cage is the sort of slick asshole that made -- and then kept -- Cruise a star. He used to run an advertising agency. Now he does PR for the Army. He sits in his officers uniform across from Gleeson and tries to slither out of conscription (his assignment is to lead the filming of the UDFs assault on the aliens on Normandy Beach). Cruise does that smug ""Oh I don think so"" laugh that because there are a dozen Cruisier things to talk about we usually overlook with him. But its right up there with Eddie Murphys rusted ""heh heh heh"" and Julia Robertss cackle. Its a well-done sequence that hits all the Cruise notes. He laughs. He gets prissily pissed (""I do this to avoid doing that"") and tries to blackmail his way out of his predicament. He leaps out of his chair and bolts for an exit. But there he is waking up in a vast barracks at Heathrow Airport still trying to talk himself loose -- only now as punishment for attempted blackmail Cage isnt even a major. Hes just another soldier on his way to fight. An American master sergeant (Bill Paxton) barrels around the barracks with Cage yapping up at him like a schnauzer pleading his case. It doesnt work. Before you know it Cage is fastened into a high-tech ""ExoSuit"" and with the rest of his platoon dangling from a gadget then dropped onto the modern-day mayhem of Normandy Beach. (Flagrant-allegory alert The invasion emanated from Germany.) Cruise has dramatically acted the horrors of war before. Here he risks playing the shock for a laugh running and shooting cluelessly amid real soldiers. Liman doesnt do a lot of slow motion. You assume he wanted to get out of Saving Private Ryans way while getting at the hyperreal chaos of a nonhistorical war. The movie provides a fresh sense of the utter lethal arbitrariness of combat What wont kill you? Cage lasts amid the death and destruction long enough to catch the arrival of UDFs most famous soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) before a Mimic wends from the sand and having been shot up spills acid all over Cages face. He pops awake at the barracks on the day of his arrival 24 hours or so before with a drill sergeant screaming ""Wake up maggot"" in his ear. On his second or third life Cage begins to collaborate with Vrataski who had the same mysterious thing happen to her. None of the whys or the hows of these resurrections are worth going into since they hold the enjoyably ludicrous keys to the larger plot. Edge of Tomorrow is based on a Japanese novel turned manga called All You Need Is Kill. The script is credited to Christopher McQuarrie and the brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and it gets off on deploying philosophical business about free will and being the ""master of your own fate."" Salvation here is possible only with autonomy. But you know its also a movie that has just as much to say about generic big ideas as it has time to glorify pop militarism -- so feel free to think about Aliens and the shooter game of your choice. This too was the premise of Source Code a 2011 Duncan Jones science-fiction thriller with Jake Gyllenhaal that addressed not at all tastelessly wishful antiterrorism. That movie did a lot with a little. It was like 24 dressing up as Vertigo for Halloween. Edge of Tomorrow is Full Metal Jacket taking two War of the Worlds and waking up inside a version of Groundhog Day thats been held hostage by Private Benjamin. I didnt know whod directed Edge of Tomorrow before I got there but the film has the confidence of someone who understands rising action and appreciates a grim kinetic sort of visual comedy. Of course its Limans name that came up during the closing credits. He can do good expensive-looking contraptions (Go The Bourne Identity) bad contraptions (Jumper) and ludicrous ones (both Mr. and Mrs. Smith and the gassy Valerie Plame thriller Fair Game which the Butterworths wrote are also his). This time Liman has a sharp script cleverly designed effects and an inspired editor (James Herbert) and cinematographer (Dion Beebe). The kick of a movie like this comes from the fun being had in its execution. It certainly doesnt come from originality. The finale uses Paris as such a Dan Brown-level amusement park that youre sad to discover that Opus Dei isnt behind the invasion. Otherwise its rare to get to one of these behemoth productions and discover that theres wit in the fuel tank -- formal wit. Its not enough for Cage to keep dying. The movie has to be clever about the deaths. The ""live die repeat"" power allows Cage to get some kind of narrative toehold. To master this scenario is to end what seems like a pretty ideologically vacuous invasion. The Mimics are just babysitting the source of their power. Ultimately this is a two-hour video game. But the filmmakers play it well. They bring energy to the repetition and the film comes through. Once Cruise is crushed by a crashing plane. Then hes wiped off the screen by a speeding Humvee. Eventually he stops lapping at the Master Sergeant and in each new life tries to convince the grunts and brass of his oracular endowment in part by finishing the sentences of other soldiers. This is all so Tom Cruise. Of course hes taking words out of other actors mouths But the movie has a very good time building layered rhythms out of his obnoxious exasperation. He doesnt have time for the guy from the BBCs Robin Hood to finish his lines; hes gotta save the world. Vrataski knows this and has even less time. Whenever Cage screws up out comes her gun. The visual music guiding these sequences is grimly comical Bang ""Wake up maggot"" Bang ""Maggot"" Bang ""Maggot"" Being the woman in a Tom Cruise movie has always seemed thankless. Shell almost never win. Rosamund Pike hit a new low in 2012s Jack Reacher playing a defense attorney so dumb that Cruise had to do all of her thinking. Its fitting that one of the few women to really push back is named Blunt. Sure shes shown at least three times rising up sweatily lustily from cobra pose. And I dont like her in this warrior mode -- graffiti on bus posters of Vrataski read ""Full Metal Bitch"" as if the kids thought she were Sigourney Weaver. It doesnt feel as if Blunt wants to be here but this is where the road of decent commercial parts takes you. So she keeps putting a gun to her costars head and making the most of it. But Cruise doesnt try to steamroll her. They become a comic unit -- although he does get around to looking at her in that way and all you hear is the clanging of pots and pans. No one wants to see these two do more than shoot and steer and impale stuff. He sells you the rest of it though the terror of operating one of those ExoSuits the disorientation the gradual exhilaration of mastering the time loop turning from petulant Cocktail Tom to the Tom who can fire weapons while spinning around the rim of a trench. All it took was dying about 75 times and each time being relieved to open his eyes and still be even more himself. There will be people annoyed that he keeps waking up at all. But theres almost no one else whod keep trying this hard to die on our behalf. Death hovers over The Fault in Our Stars. The entire movie hums with the harsh chilly light of a hospital. Its a romantic comedy about adolescent cancer patients so the grim glow doesnt feel like a strategy so much as a side effect. The first thing its 16-year-old heroine Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) says is ""This is the truth. Sorry."" That seems right for a film whose characters are shot so that they barely cast a shadow Theres nowhere to hide. Hazel has stage-four lymphoma and an oxygen tube in her nose.  She conducts herself with the bitter poise of a Bronte character who adores being a Bronte character. Her parents (Laura Dern Sam Trammell) coax Hazel Grace into a support group. Thats where she meets Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort) a long bright-faced kid with amusing self-confidence. His cancers in remission but hes there for his friend Isaac (Nat Wolff) whose own cancer is on the verge of taking his second eye. Augustus slips a cigarette in his mouth and Hazel Grace assumes hes mocking the matter at hand. But no he says The cigarette is a metaphor for what cant kill him. They begin trading text messages. She makes him read her favorite novel something awful-sounding called An Imperial Affliction. He says ""How would you like to go on a picnic with me?"" It goes on from there. Mom and dad dotingly watch as these two fall for each other and a trace of pity is detectable in all their love. The stars are crossed but doom isnt whats drawing Hazel Grace and Augustus to each other. It really feels like love one defined by circumstances that set them apart from the majority of their peers. What a strange movie. A trip to Amsterdam leads to a kiss in Anne Franks attic that inspires applause from the surrounding visitors. The whole film is like that appallingly romantic. I cant recall anything this close to both an after-school special and a European art-house tragedy in its flat ugly style and emotional nakedness. Its reminiscent of Say Anything ... or when the terrifically oddball Wolffs around the latter 30 minutes of Ferris Buellers Day Off. Its not as competently made as either of those movies and for too long its more posturing and glib. But if I spent an hour rolling my eyes the final 20 minutes were devoted to contemplating blowing my nose. The film was adapted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber from John Greens best seller and was directed by Josh Boone. Green wrote the most inescapable book since the Harry Potters. Its covering peoples faces on the subway. Its dog-eared on coffeeshop tables. Its jutting out of book bags. For every 20 pages of pretentious back-patting prose theres a line of resonant simplicity like ""I fell in love with the way you fall asleep."" It sits on the young adult shelf but its mass appeal makes sense. It is in its way a rebellion novel fuck this disease fuck pity fuck dying. The movie picks up where Green leaves off fuck filmmaking. The poor shotmaking and the too-close close-ups are a trial. At some point were staring at a wall for five seconds before a character opens a door and stands in front of it.  And yet -- and yet -- theres something about the performances that gets to you. Its point-blank earnest. Dern and Trammell spend the movie looking like theyve just donated kidneys to unicorns. Theyre being more than they are acting. So are Woodley Elgort and Wolff. Woodley is like vintage Debra Winger self-possession that refuses to fall to pieces. It takes a while to get used to her bristling independence -- sort of the way you had to come around to Ione Skyes air-dried approach to intelligence in Say Anything ... . Elgorts even better. In Divergent he played Woodleys brother. But this is the more believable relationship. He gives every line a sweetness. I didnt remember him from Divergent right away and assumed that his artificial leg was real that he was some kind of miracle discovery a self-confident lug who could effortlessly embody besotted decency. Theres a moment when the breeziness powering the story goes away and medical reality takes over and Elgorts performance goes to a surprising new place. This is acting (and moviemaking) that has almost nothing to do with conventional norms of ""good."" Its pure and true and just vividly there. The shock is that eventually there you are with them wiping away the suds and snot.

By Peter Rainer Film critic June 6 2014 Save for later Saved Edge of Tomorrow stars Tom Cruise. David James/Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is like ""Groundhog Day"" except its about gigantic spidery alien invaders and it stars Tom Cruise clomping around in an 85-pound exoskeleton. Let me explain. Cruise plays Major William Cage a military PR officer who is unwillingly recruited into a hopeless combat mission against the marauders. Killed almost immediately he finds himself thrown inside a time loop that has him repeatedly fighting and dying in the same attack. Each time out though he survives a bit longer because he is savvier about the onslaught.How many times can he expire and be resurrected before he exits the loop and defeats the aliens? And will Cruise end up tipping over from all that hardware? Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Based on an illustrated Japanese novella and directed by Doug Liman from a screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth ""Edge of Tomorrow"" has a few too many time loops for my taste. It took a while to get the hang of the ""Groundhog Day"" concept but once I did I didnt especially look forward to the serial spin-cycle convolutions. The films relentless clangor is assaultive. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Cruise is better than hes been in a while because he damps down his usual all-intensity-all-the-time MO. Hes best here when his character seems the most scared. And Emily Blunt as a commando legend is indomitable a credit to her exoskeleton.

REUTERS gallery Celebrity Photos of the Week On the recruitment trail with Tom Cruise 120 minutes3.5 STARSLanding on strange shores is one element Doug Limans Edge of Tomorrow and James Grays The Immigrant share and at first glance that might seem the end of it. The first movie after all is a Tom Cruise summer-tentpole cornpopper about a man spun by a time loop to fight the same marauding alien hordes on the same beach every time he dies and The Immigrant is a sombre silent-era throwback melodrama about a Polish woman (Marion Cotillard) struggling for dignity and self-direction on the streets of New York in 1921.But look more closely on screen and off and a tale of two filmmakers both working at their peaks in dissimilar forms begins to emerge. Its a tale of artistic tenacity and maturity on one level but on another its a tale of whats happened to American movies in the past 20 years and the struggle to find (and keep) a voice in a business that only has ears for the ringing of profits.Nineteen-ninety-four was the year that both these directors New York born and bred made their debuts Liman with a cheeky morally sideways comedy of academic upward mobility called Getting In and Gray with a wintry family gangster tragedy called Little Odessa. Both announced distinctive but raw sensibilities and each led to bigger things - Liman broke out with Swingers in 1996 and Gray garnered serious festival traction with The Yards in 2000 - and each signalled divergent ambitions. Liman was a filmmaker determined to put the mark of personal idiosyncracy on commercial projects (as he would with Go and The Bourne Identity) while Gray - taking the lesser travelled and increasingly neglected high road - set himself the task of dragging commercial genres up the steep slope of serious art.In the aftermath of Pulp Fiction - also arriving in 94 - the market seemed open to both approaches. There was a surge of ""indie"" pride and optimism but it proved fleeting. At the same time people were staking a claim for the resurgence of maverick cinema the commercial mainstream was hunkering down to CGI-based blockbusters and franchise bet-hedgers and the gap between commercial and art movies opened like dividing continents Commercial movies were those that opened everywhere and could be seen by everyone while art movies were marched summarily off to festivals and the occasional blink-and-you-miss-it big-city theatrical release. It was a strategy of cautious corporate loss-minimizing that on the one hand made it harder than ever for Liman to work personally within the system and on the other cast Gray almost entirely without.That both have attained a kind of peak of sorts with their new movies is testament to the talent and tenacity of each. But it also reminds us of the industrial lockdown of these 20 years. These are movies that might as well have been produced by and for different universes as remote from each other in terms of tone market presence public awareness and promotional priority as members of the same media species can get.But the pertinent fact is theyre both good - very good. Limans movie based on a Japanese novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka is almost hermetically airtight in terms of structure and the genre-mashup it attains so seamlessly - imagine Saving Private Ryan cross-pollenated with Groundhog Day or War of the Worlds reconsidered as heavy-metal rom-com - is only more impressive for providing precisely what weve come to expect in our opening-run megaplex experience aliens effects superheroics roller-coaster tummy flips and of course Tom Cruise whom Liman brilliantly casts as a spineless coward turned reluctant hero a kind of 21st-century Cary Grant. All in all a perfectly superior example of industrially fortified Hollywood fun and as good a guarantee as Doug Liman can offer that we havent seen the last of him yet.Then theres The Immigrant probably James Grays most beautiful moving and expansive work a sepia-steeped ode to immigrant resilience struggle and conditional American Dreaming that visually evokes Coppolas Godfather Part II and Leones Once Upon a Time in America but in its utterly irony-free melodramatic sincerity also suggests a silent-era womans picture a la D.W. Griffith King Vidor or G.W. Pabst.Daring for being so unabashedly serious romantic and classical and providing the context for a trio of performances - Cotillard Joaquin Phoenix and Jeremy Renner - that are permitted to grow and breathe in the movies deep spaces and slow rhythms Grays movie is an almost flawlessly articulated example of the kind of thing we like to say they just dont make any more serious adult character-driven and impassioned. That it wont be seen by nearly anywhere near the amount of people who will jump off the Edge of Tomorrow is a foregone conclusion but that shouldnt diminish our gratitude for the fact it exists to be seen in the first place. As long as good American movies continue to be made on both ends of the art and commerce axis and filmmakers such as Liman and Gray stick with the struggle theres hope for a future. And maybe even one where movies can share the same dream of overcoming odds that their characters do.

Cruise plays a smarmy military PR guy--a physical coward and not ashamed of it--who sells the public on a European campaign against spidery creatures called ""Mimics"" and then after mouthing off to a general (Brendan Gleeson) gets sent kicking and screaming to the front line. After hes torn to pieces on the battlefield along with the rest of his platoon he wakes up intact and is sent to the front again... and again... and again. To find out why the world keeps resetting itself he must track down Emily Blunt as a fabled warrior--the ""Angel of Verdun"" the scythe-wielding heroine of a previous Mimic battle--and give a lot more lives for his country. I mean a lot more lives. Eat your heart out Nathan Hale. Briskly directed by Doug Liman the film is based on a semi-literate Japanese novel called All You Need is Kill that I gave up on after 30 pages. A group of high-paid screenwriters clearly had a hell of a time figuring out how much repetition we can take and where the ellipses should go. One key emotional beat between Cruise and Blunt is referred to but never shown Was it cut to keep the running time down? Its probably no great loss but here and elsewhere the seams show. And in this sort of movie its often more fun before we get our bearings and have time to say ""This makes no sense."" The Mimics move very quickly and have no evident personality What precisely are they mimicking? It makes me think so fondly of the Sentinels in X-Men Days of Future Past. Even the alien insects in Starship Troopers have more soul. But if the last part of Edge of Tomorrow isnt up to what precedes it its certainly rousing and gives you plenty of permutations to play around with in your head on the way home.A After impersonating manly men of action for the last few years Cruise obviously relishes playing a clumsy fraidy-cat--and relishes even more becoming a lean mean fighting machine before your (and Emily Blunts) eyes. Blunt was recently surprised to be reminded of an old interview in which she said shed rather do badly paid theater for the rest of her life than accept a role ""as a spear carrier in a Tom Cruise movie."" But shes a hell of a spear carrier. Her skin is copper-colored her body so taut and wiry that she looks like a member of a higher race. Its a drag when Cruise takes over most of the heroics but not enough to kill the rush from watching the universes most gorgeous terminator. Edge of Tomorrow. Directed by Doug Liman Warner Bros PG-13.

It opens this Friday June 6th the seventieth anniversary of D Day--and that massive and decisive Normandy landing tweaked to fit the movies futuristic premise is also its main dramatic event. The metaphorical overlay of fantasy and history is the best thing ""Edge of Tomorrow"" has to offer--and for much of its running time that overlay is enough to lend the movie a shiver of curious power. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" as everyone already knows is a sci-fi war film with a ""Groundhog Day""-like premise Cruise plays a soldier who after being killed in combat awakens the day before the battle and must relive over and over the moment of his death. Yet the movie hidden behind ""Edge of Tomorrow"" isnt ""Groundhog Day"" but rather ""Saving Private Ryan."" The terrifyingly gory opening sequence of Steven Spielbergs film--the landing at Omaha Beach--poses a fundamental question about war If the D Day combat had been reported in real time and in detail if the uncensored newsreel footage that it generated played like Spielbergs realistic scene--with its dismembered limbs dangling viscera incinerated bodies cries of agony scattered corpses and waves of blood--would the American public have tolerated the pursuit of the war until the enemies surrender? And would sufficient numbers of American men have fought in it willingly? That question is the premise of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" the world is battling alien creatures who have killed hundreds of millions of people in Europe and the allied army known as the United Defense Force (U.D.F.) is planning a colossal and top-secret mobilization to cross the English Channel and gain a beachhead in France in order to reconquer the continent from the invading organisms. On the eve of the great mission Major William Cage (Cruise) a U.D.F. information officer is ordered to be embedded in a combat battalion in order to ""sell the war"" to the citizenry. Because the setup is the source of much of the movies pleasure more or less any discussion of the story is a spoiler. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a movie that offers primarily the glee of its telling--the well-crafted delight of a tall fantasy thats as shallow as it is clever--and Im going to indulge in the pleasure of this well-wrought yarn by simply telling it. Cage a former advertising executive who has no military training or background wants no part of the fight and he refuses the order from the general in command (Brendan Gleeson). He tries to flee and is tased into submission--only to awaken in the staging area demoted to private and forced into a front-line combat unit under the hard-nosed command of Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton). But the beach landing goes horribly awry. The troops are being massacred by the superfast thrashing whip-tentacled monsters and Cage confronting an especially big and mean creature is himself quickly killed. Then in a brashly effective and simple cut from one shot to another Cage comes instantly back to life restored to the way he was at the start of the day of battle at the moment of his reawakening after being tased. The crucial and delicious detail is that Cages curse to die again endlessly (though somehow seemingly painlessly) affords him a limitless capacity to learn on the job--each return to battle is both another lesson in warfare and another chance to probe the enemys vulnerabilities. Soon reawakening at the British base Cage chooses a martial mentor Sergeant Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) a commando fighter who was the heroine of the U.D.F.s one prior military victory on the continent (shes nicknamed the Angel of Verdun extending a metaphor one generation back). Vrataski trains Cage and accompanies him into battle. They are both helped by a discredited physicist (Noah Taylor) whose speculative simulations reveal the enemys deft deceptions and hidden weakness. The idea of the movie (based on the novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka) is a corker which is why its worth reemphasizing the spoiler alert. At the same time as Cages reiterated lives allow him to master the monsters we learn that the monsters central brain has allowed Cage to be regenerated on purpose. The monster brain is using Cage to learn how humans fight. Vrataski was also similarly chosen. As it turns out she offered humanity a Pyrrhic victory at Verdun the aliens allowed her troops to win there in order to observe and master her tactics. When Cage and Vrataski figure this out they recognize that they have to get one step ahead of the aliens on the learning curve and must anticipate their play one move in advance in order to make their decisive advance toward Paris. (The story deals with the sci-fi problem of parallel worlds by making each new iteration ontologically supersede the previous one last world definitive world.) ""Edge of Tomorrow"" conveys its ingenious historically resonant premise but never develops it. The narrative is high-concept gimmickry realized with efficiency and energy but not much imagination. The engineering of the intricate story and the deft dovetailing needed to iterate multiple lives in rapid succession seem to have taxed Limans art as does the effort to simulate chemistry between Cruise and Blunt. Shes an active and alert performer who throughout seems to want more--a character with a life story to sink her interpretive teeth into--whereas Cruise takes Cages one-note backstory the cowardly out-of-work ad man and expands it and himself to the breaking point. Cruises eternal sheen of callow youth is integrated into the very substance of the film. As Cage is converted by circumstances into a hardened and capable fighting machine (veering toward superhero territory) the story tracks his dramatic transformation in under two hours from a raw trainee into a military hero. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" turns out to be the movie that Cage was ordered to make his greatest recruiting film. What difference would it make to such a juicy tale if Liman had brought more imagination to its direction? If he had parsed the action with more detail and more nuance or had conceived and encapsulated the characters with more insight? The problem with a good story thats nothing more than a good story is that it exhausts itself in the telling as this one does and never makes the leap from idea to experience. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" requires Cages heroism to be simultaneously physical and intellectual a matter of calculation and anticipation as well as of courage and execution. Whats missing from the movie is the existential adventure that it implies--the confrontation with death the overcoming of pain. Liman offers war leached of horror--death without pain memory without trauma--and narrows Cage to a stick figure emptied of the fascinating and disturbing psychological implications of his adventure. The movie is also humorless--at least devoid of intentional humor. Yet the demands of the international movie-distribution marketplace seem to be responsible for a howlingly funny clinching line of dialogue capping the heroes success ""Russian and Chinese forces are marching across Europe without resistance."" It promises an utterly unintended sequel. Richard Brody began writing for The New Yorker in 1999 and has contributed articles about the directors Francois Truffaut Jean-Luc Godard and Samuel Fuller.

Starring Shailene Woodley Ansel Elgort and Nat Wolff. (Photo/Video Fox) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com June 5 2014 446 p.m. ET 1 COMMENTS Almost half a century ago ""Love Story"" a weeper that was destined to become a national obsession began with the deathless words ""What can you say about a 25-year-old girl who died?"" Now ""The Fault in Our Stars"" seeks to become its successor with a new story of doomed romance. What can you say about a movie that brings two beautiful teens together in a cancer support group? That its stars do what theyre asked to do in one case faultlessly; that its ambitions are equaled by its contrivances; and that those contrivances however shameless are partly offset by the beauty of Shailene Woodleys portrayal of the heroine and narrator Hazel Grace Lancaster whose love of life is as palpable as the disease that threatens to kill her. Hazel has a fondness for straight talk. Shes depressed she tells us in a preface but not because depression is in the conventional wisdom a side effect of cancer. ""Its a side effect of dying"" she says ""which is whats happening to me."" Living with cancer-ravaged lungs she is tethered to an oxygen bottle wherever she goes and wears a nasal cannula a little two-pronged piece of plastic that delivers the oxygen to her nostrils. (In a fleetingly affecting detail Hazel checking herself out in a mirror before her first visit to the support group adjusts the cannula like a fashion accessory.) The boy who becomes the love of her life Augustus Waters has a penchant for expansive talk. Cancer-free after losing one leg Gus is insistently sometimes insufferably verbal and as played by Ansel Elgort almost preposterously handsome. Looking like an Adonis is hardly Mr. Elgorts fault but neither is the heros windiness. In John Greens phenomenally successful young-adult novel Gus is partial to big words and fancy locutions but theyre a cover in a nuanced character for the existential terror that his cancer will come back. In the movie the arc of Guss character is drawn with a brush so broad that it smudges. He eventually reveals his vulnerability and movingly so but before that Mr. Elgort is encouraged or indulged in posturings that make the hero an annoying presence and a baffling one a visitant from some weird preppie culture . More The Fault in Our Stars Ansel Elgort and John Green at the WSJ Cafe How Ed Sheeran Joined TFIOS Soundtrack John Greens Teen Revolution The John Green Glossary Does the Film Depart Too Much From the Book? Nuance isnt part of the productions program. The director Josh Boone goes for maximum emotional impact most of the time and usually gets what hes after. (The music by Mike Mogis and Nate Walcott should come under the campaign to outlaw large sugary drinks.) Theres no question that the movie will be a huge hit both because of and in spite of its manipulations the most flagrant of which--taken directly from the book it should be said--uses Anne Franks life to heighten our feelings about Hazel. Still moments of grace punctuate the film which was adapted by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber. (They wrote last years ""The Spectacular Now"" a romantic comedy with much more of a spontaneous independent spirit in which Ms. Woodley gave another endearing performance opposite Miles Teller.) Laura Dern as Hazels mother spends most of her screen time exuding brittle jauntiness but her defenses crumble in a mother-daughter confrontation about what happens if or when Hazel dies. Hazel rises fiercely to another confrontation with a novelist played lugubriously by Willem Dafoe who proves to be anything but the wise man shed been seeking. ""The Fault in Our Stars"" is Hazels story and it is Ms. Woodleys movie at almost every moment shes on camera. She has the precious gift of simplicity whether shes observing the people around her with a cool eye or filling the screen with a warmth that seems to come naturally. Others in the cast work at being winning; she wins by seeming to be herself. Thats putting her achievement too simply of course. What leavens the heaviness of the theme is the heroines wry wit which Ms. Woodley deploys just as naturally. And when the time comes for suffering the pain of watching her is mingled with the pleasure of a performance that transcends contrivance. This young actress is the real heart-piercing thing. Watch a clip from the film ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Starring Tom Cruise Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton. (Photo/Video Warner Bros.) Edge of Tomorrow Never has a megabudget sci-fi spectacular been hung on a loopier premise but ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is great eccentric fun until its intentional repetitions get to be well repetitive. The premise is literally loopy. At a time in the future when our poor planet is being pummeled by seemingly invincible--and extremely unpleasant--alien invaders Tom Cruises Maj. William Cage a desk jockey determined to remain one finds himself plunged into a suicide mission. Worse still hes killed on the first day of combat. Much much worse still--though better for Mr. Cruise because hes so lively in the role--Cage finds himself caught in a time loop that has him fighting and dying fighting and dying over and over again. They could have called it ""Die Another Day"" but that title was taken. They might also have called it ""Groundhog Day 2"" but that wouldnt have conveyed the films martial frenzy its fascinating intricacies or the special delights of its borderline-comic tone. The comedy or more properly the odd levity doesnt kick in for a while. The combat that keeps killing Cage has echoes of World War II and for that matter ""Saving Private Ryan."" Weve lost France and Germany to the alien hordes so our last resort is a chaotic landing on a French beach. Only gradually does the reluctant warrior come to understand the bizarre terms of his existence--he has acquired the ability to reset time--and the chance it may give him to warn his superiors of the carnage thats certain to come. Little by little hes able to bend circumstances to his will and then to join forces with the most illustrious of the human warriors a woman named Rita Vrataski whos written thinly but played to the Valkyrie hilt by Emily Blunt. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" was directed with energy and elan by Doug Liman; hes best known for the first of the Jason Bourne films but he also directed a disjointed sci-fi curiosity called ""Jumper."" This movie adapted by Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth from a novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka is neither disjointed nor jointed; it is what it is an ingenious elaboration of a set of givens that like all time-travel plots dont fully withstand scrutiny. And dont merit comparison except in the most obvious sense to ""Groundhog Day"" whose hero undergoes moral and spiritual growth. The growth in Maj. Cage is practical and tactical; he only learns how to save the world while establishing some sort of liaison with fearless Rita in the process. (The impressive production was designed by Oliver Scholl. Dion Beebe did the cinematography.) Its worth noting that Mr. Cruise already saved the world from aliens in ""War of the Worlds"" then saved it more recently in ""Oblivion."" All the same ""Edge of Tomorrow"" gives him a chance to reinvigorate his career and he grabs it. (Reinvention isnt in the cards at this point and anyway who else could he be?) An action hero who has made running a subspecialty he runs with charming clumsiness at first a sort of Walter Mitty in a combat exoskeleton. Then bit by bit and day by day the dazed and confused Cage finds his rhythm and Mr. Cruise hits his stride. Its a rousing spectacle interspersed with touching moments of really hard trying. Watch a clip from the film ""Obvious Child."" Starring Jenny Slate Jake Lacy and Gaby Hoffmann. (Photo/Video A24 Films) Obvious Child Gillian Robespierres small strong debut feature which takes its title from the Paul Simon song is set mostly in Brooklyn and takes its energy from the startlingly funny and poignant performance of its star Jenny Slate. She plays Donna Stern a whipsmart Jewish 20-something with an eggshell ego who is struggling to make a career for herself as a stand-up comic. In the jaundiced view of her mother (Polly Draper) a college professor who still remembers Donnas College Board scores shes already a failure ""You waste that 780 verbal on telling jokes about having diarrhea in your pants."" Maybe so though not the whole story. (Richard Kind plays Donnas puppeteer father who adores her.) This desperate heroine is a hard case and terribly tender at the same time. She spews her jokes about bodily functions to establish a trashy intimacy but equally to keep her audiences and her friends at bay. ""Obvious Child"" is most obviously about what happens when a man who is good and kind--and a WASP from Vermont--enters her life and in a single drunken night gets her pregnant. (Hes played by Jake Lacy.) Just as obviously its concerned with Donnas decision about an abortion a subject seldom dealt with in run-of-the-mine rom-coms. Yet the heart of the film lies in what it manages to say without boldface or italics about how hard it is for Donna like so many of her anxious cohort to make genuine connections to break free of narcissistic constraints and become a stand-up grown-up. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE The Descendants (2011) When I reviewed this superb film I called Shailene Woodleys performance ""phenomenal""; shes Alexandra the older daughter of George Clooneys Matt. I also said a case could be made for her character rather than his as the storys protagonist the driving force who points her confused father in the right direction when family secrets are revealed. Be that as it may Ms. Woodley was a revelation in her first major screen role. Alexander Payne directed from an adaptation by himself Nat Faxon and Jim Rash of a novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings. ENLARGE Mission Impossible--Ghost Protocol (2011) Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt in the fourth installment of the near-venerable series which is lifted by its IMAX action sequences from impressive action to spectacular abstraction. The best stuff transpires in Dubai where Ethan scales the worlds tallest building the Burj Khalifa with the IMAX camera recording his human-fly escapade in wondrously dense yet expansive detail. The director was Brad Bird the animation genius making his debut in live-action features. ENLARGE 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days (2007) Cristian Mungius elegantly crafted brilliantly acted film isnt about abortion in an incidental way like ""Obvious Child."" Its about abortion in a direct and harrowing way. The setting is late 1980s Bucharest near the end of the despicable Ceausescu regime when abortion is a crime that carries prison terms for all concerned. The underground abortionist played by an extraordinary actor named Vlad Ivanov is a predator who destroys not just one life but in a chilling sense two. --J.M.

"Review Edge of Tomorrow Tom Cruise run loops around competition - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Edge of Tomorrow Tom Cruise run loops around competition Edge of Tomorrow Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Edge of Tomorrow starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Edge of Tomorrow starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Edge of Tomorrow doesnt get stuck in its time loop - it feels fresh not repetitive Just when you were ready to give up on the summer season and its cookie-cutter been-there blockbusters ""Edge of Tomorrow"" saves the day. Its a star-driven mass-market entertainment thats smart exciting and unexpected while not stinting on genre satisfactions.Certainly a 178-million Tom Cruise-starring science-fiction epic about humanitys fight to the death against pesky alien invaders does not sound as though its pushing any envelopes but with Doug Liman in charge dont be so sure. As previous credits like ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" attest Liman is a director congenitally averse to doing things in an ordinary way. Aided by performances by Cruise and costar Emily Blunt that also depart from whats come before ""Edge of Tomorrow"" manages to show us familiar events in a way were not used to seeing them.Initial credit for all this should go to Japanese novelist Hiroshi Sakurazaka whose video-game-inspired ""All You Need Is Kill"" was the source material that took a village of screenwriters -- Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth are the ones who got credit -- to turn into a propulsive script. ""Edge of Tomorrows"" central idea -- an ingenious mash-up of ""War of the Worlds"" and ""Groundhog Day"" encapsulated in the films ""Live Die Repeat"" tag line -- is easy enough to grasp. But the fast-moving storys unforeseen complexities so push against the corners of the mind that there are times when its hard to be sure exactly whats happening and why. Fault in Our Stars likely to break Tom Cruises heart at box office Ryan Faughnder Following a string of weekends dominated by rampaging monsters mutant superheroes and a Disney fairy tale villain love-struck teens are likely to supply one of the summers breakout hits.  The weepy love story ""The Fault in Our Stars"" opening this weekend is expected to challenge Disneys ""Maleficent""... Following a string of weekends dominated by rampaging monsters mutant superheroes and a Disney fairy tale villain love-struck teens are likely to supply one of the summers breakout hits.  The weepy love story ""The Fault in Our Stars"" opening this weekend is expected to challenge Disneys ""Maleficent""... (Ryan Faughnder) Keeping us going at those moments and all others is Limans confidence and elan as a director his filmmaking bravado if you will. Working with cinematographer Dion Beebe editor James Herbert and visual effects supervisor Nick Davis Liman is so adroit at layering in action and tension that we are swept away by his brisk cinematic tide even when we lose track of where its taking us.One of the keys to ""Edge of Tomorrows"" effectiveness is the sharp on-target performance by Cruise who gets to play one of the rare blockbuster protagonists whose character is allowed to believably transform right in front of our eyes. Edge of Tomorrow official trailer See more videos ""Edge of Tomorrow"" begins not with Cruises Maj. William Cage but with the understandable chaos of an invasion of Earth by aliens known as Mimics a creepy race that look a bit like a horde of angry metallic squid. Five years into the battle for Earths survival Maj. Cage is introduced helicoptering into London to meet Gen. Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) the man in charge of a forthcoming D-Day like invasion of continental Europe by the United Defense Force a do-or-die attempt to banish those Mimics once and for all.Cage may be a major but he is not a military man. Rather hes a public relations specialist whose job has been to sell the war effort to the public. Not only that in a shrewd nod to the way the actors detractors see him Cruise seems to enjoy the chance to play Cage as shallow callow self-interested and manipulative.Not the most politic of men Cage rubs the general the wrong way and ends up broken to private and placed in the care of Master Sgt. Farrell (Bill Paxton) a career soldier who believes in homilies like ""there is no courage without fear"" and ""battle is the great redeemer.""Cage is placed among the veterans of J Squad and ends up in the front lines when the invasion of Europe begins the next day.Totally at sea in his fancy ExoSuit body armor not even sure how to fire his weapon this stranger in a strange land catches a battlefield glimpse of one of the UDFs genuine killing machines Sgt. Rita Vrataski (Blunt) alternately known as the Angel of Verdun (a nod to one of World War Is bloodiest battles) or the more descriptive Full Metal Bitch.Cage has barely gotten a look at Vrataski when hes unceremoniously killed by a Mimic. Thats right killed. But rather than end the film that death jump-starts the plot into a higher gear.For once Cage wakes up in the same helicopter that began his journey he comes to realize hes reliving the preceding 24 hours. He has for intriguing reasons that will be gradually revealed entered into a time loop fated to experience the day over and over again though the other people in his life think its all happening for the first time.Through the kind of trial and error video game players are familiar with Cage soon stays alive long enough to exchange a few words with Vrataski who tells him to seek her out the next time he awakes. That begins a complex process of understanding both what has happened to him and how the experience just might be of use to defeat the Mimics and end the war.""Edge of Tomorrows"" continual repetition may sound boring but Liman and his team have worked out multiple permutations and iterations to get us into each new recurrence and both stars are strong actors fully committed to their roles.With her blond hair tough attitude and combat-ready physique Blunts Vrataski is very different from the characters the actress has played before as well as being a fine foil for Cage. As for the films star Cruise takes full advantage of the plots notion that all that combat repetition gradually changes him into a fighting force to be reckoned with. We believe that transformation because we see it happening which in a film as fantastical as ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a very good thing indeed.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------Edge of TomorrowMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence language and brief suggestive materialRunning time 1 hour 53 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Column Entertainment Tom Cruise Brendan Gleeson Bill Paxton Edge of Tomorrow Tom Cruise action flick is loopy fun reviews say Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-edge-of-tomorrow-20140606-column.html,200,edgeoftomorrow12,edgeoftomorrow,latimes

William Cage a soldier whos woefully unprepared for battle in Edge of Tomorrow. Warner Brothers Pictures hide caption toggle caption Warner Brothers Pictures Tom Cruise as Maj. William Cage a soldier whos woefully unprepared for battle in Edge of Tomorrow. Warner Brothers Pictures Its rarely a compliment to say that a movie is video game-like. Thats usually shorthand for effects-heavy narratively lightweight CGI shootem-ups. Dont get me wrong Edge of Tomorrow has no shortage of big effects set pieces a lot of invading aliens getting shot at and the seemingly ageless Tom Cruise performing death-defying acts on a battlefield. Except that he doesnt defy death and thats where the film borrows an important quality of video games to anchor its story Death is never the end. Death in a video game means rebooting going back to the last save point and trying again this time presumably ready for what killed you last time. Thats the situation facing Maj. William Cage (Cruise) a weaselly military PR flack who gets railroaded onto the battlefield by a hardened general (Brendan Gleeson) who feels a soldiers wartime duty is to spend at least a little time on the front lines. In this case that means putting on a mechanized exoskeletal battle suit and going up against a horde of ""mimics"" fearsome alien creatures that have already conquered much of the earth. Cage woefully unprepared for battle cant even figure out how to turn the safety off on the suits guns when he gets dropped D-Day-style onto a French beachhead only to die a few minutes later and then awake the day before back on the base just when this nightmare began. So begins his own video game in which he eventually lives on the battlefield long enough to meet Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) a soldier he only knows by reputation because hed been using her image in recruiting efforts following her heroic efforts in humanitys only victory in the war so far. Turns out her skill at that battle grew out of becoming caught in a loop similar to the one Cage is in now. Hers ended but when she realizes Cage is going through the same thing she instructs him to meet up with her after the next time he dies so they can work together. And die he does many many times -- often at Vrataskis own hand. Before they can take on the enemy together she must train him and shes harder than any drill sergeant. Once shes injured him beyond the point of usefulness she kills him so he can start again. Its like Phil Connors piano lessons in Groundhog Day if the kindly piano teacher put a bullet in Phils head every time his fingers started to get sore. Given the world-in-peril stakes it would have been easy to make this into a grim affair; gritty is the zeitgeist for sci-fi and superheroes these days after all. But the script (written and rewritten by a number of people over the past few years but credited to Christopher McQuarrie and Jez amp; John-Henry Butterworth) has a knowing comedic edge and director Doug Liman embraces those lighter elements particularly in the early scenes of Cage caught in the loop at the base dealing with a comically tough-as-nails sergeant played by Bill Paxton. Liman has gone the all-business route before with The Bourne Identity and hes done far-too-glib with Mr. and Mrs. Smith but this strikes an immensely winning balance between the two. Blunt plays it straight the hardened supersoldier to Cruises inept coward. He might get most of the laughs but she puts the violent period on every punch line. Ironically Cages functional immortality actually ends up highlighting just how fragile humans are. Its contrary to action movie dogma where the heros invincibility tends to defy logic. Here his overall invincibility is a plot point facilitated by just how easy he is to kill. That makes most of Edge of Tomorrow refreshing and unexpected both for its humor and for its upending of action norms. That also makes how badly it misses the landing all the more disappointing because the climax falls so eye-rollingly back into those same conventions. Suddenly Cage has to become all but invincible to survive the big boss fight at the end of the game. Of course tradition also dictates that obviously we cant have a male and a female enduring these trials without them developing feelings for each other. Wouldnt it be even better if Cage and Vrataski werent just fighting side by side but kissing a little too? No. While it might make sense for him since hes been spending hundreds of repeated days with her for her hes still new as hes always been and theyve been spending most of their few hours together just trying not to die. Earlier versions of the script had Cage as a younger man before Cruise was cast; the shoehorned-in romance is especially exasperating now that hes old enough to be Vrataskis dad. Edge of Tomorrow does so much so well up to that point that it ends up being a minor disappointment though. Cages journey in the film is from cowardice to bravery; its just too bad the films convictions end up running the other way.

Directed by Doug Liman. 113 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. PGThe prospect of watching Tom Cruise save the day once more prompts the same deja vu blues his character experiences in Edge of Tomorrow.What again? Didnt he do this last year (Oblivion) and the year before (Jack Reacher) and the year before (Mission Impossible 4) and so on?Article Continued BelowYes yes and (sigh) yes. But heres the big difference with Edge of Tomorrow a sharp sci-fi thriller thats going to be hard to beat as the summers best blockbuster.Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt star in Edge of Tomorrow.  (David James / Warner Bros.)  For once Cruise is fully engaged with a role instead of merely selling it. Hes always the consummate professional on camera but this time hes willing to show some genuine human frailty behind that granite facade.He shows it over and over again in the films time-looping format which requires a coward to repeatedly die if he hopes to be reborn as a hero.Cruise gets grand support from a terrific co-star (a buff Emily Blunt) a smart director (Doug Liman The Bourne Identity) and a bright screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) and brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth (Fair Game).Edge of Tomorrow adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazakas popular 2004 novel All You Need Is Kill is pitched as Groundhog Day meets Independence Day and the description is good for starters.Cruises Major William Cage is a craven military PR man selling a desperate last-ditch effort by Earthlings against invading spidery giant aliens which are known as ""Mimics"" due to their battlefield adaptability. You kill one and 10 more come after you.Cage hasnt had to worry about this because hes always been safely behind a camera rather than a gun sight ""I do this to avoid doing that."" He runs afoul of a vengeful general (Brendan Gleeson) who suffers neither fools nor pantywaists and suddenly Cage finds himself at an Allied military base at Heathrow Airport. Hes been shipped to the front lines of a planned all-out assault against the Mimics on the beaches of France one that will echo the blood and guts of D-Day (the films June 6 release coincides with the 70th anniversary of that momentous World War II event).Its an involuntary suicide mission for Cage who lacks basic training and the support of his contemptuous J Squad fellow grunts. Hes nothing like Special Forces soldier Rita Vrataski (Blunt) a heavily armoured battle champ known as ""the Angel of Verdun and ""Full Metal Bitch"" for her courage and warrior skills.They say a coward dies a thousand deaths. This seems to be the fate of Cage when his first encounter with the ferocious Mimics propels him into a mysterious time loop wherein he relives his disastrous first war day over and over again -- but hes also given a chance to learn from his mistakes.Theres your Groundhog Day allusion but Id argue the better comparison is not with that 1993 rom-com but with the more recent sci-fi thriller Source Code which shares with Edge of Tomorrow a similar explosive urgency to its repetition.Movies like these risk boring the viewer -- how many times do you want to see Cruise called ""maggot"" by a disdainful superior? -- but this Edge never dulls. Special credit must go to editors James Herbert and Laura Jennings for their fleet-fingered scissoring which conveys Cages ""live die repeat"" monotony without making us endure it.The 3D cinematography by Dion Beebe who made L.A. look malevolent in Michael Manns Collateral (another career high point for Cruise) is another skilful balancing act blending realistic battle scenes with free-floating monster-movie CGI that consciously evokes the realm of video games. Edge of Tomorrow has so much going for it -- there are even a few good laughs -- you can easily forgive the climatic nonsense involving a world cultural landmark that plays like a sci-fi riff on The Da Vinci Code.When you can make repetition seem this fresh a little cut-and-paste doesnt seem so terrible.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

I would actually throw in a different comparison Its an effort to blend the DNA of ""Source Code"" with that of ""Starship Troopers"" but one that strips away exactly the things that made those movies awesome the subversive sardonic humor in one case the romantic fatalism in the other.Theres unquestionably a high degree of cleverness and craft at work in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" a high-concept near-future war flick that plays out an elaborate plot conceit as long as it possibly can before devolving into routine suck-on-this alien-vs.-human CGI battle sequences. Its almost certainly a huge summer hit that will solidify Cruises post-Oprah comeback as a box-office champ just in time for his 52nd birthday. ""Edge"" was directed by veteran Hollywood style maven Doug Liman (of ""Go"" and ""The Bourne Identity"") whose biggest contribution to cultural history may have been making the film that got Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt together and it was shot on actual 35mm film by cinematographer Dion Beebe. (One intriguing subtext of the last year or so in movies is that the film medium isnt dead after all.)In that Groundhoggy high concept Ive mentioned Cruises character a scaredy-pants P.R. officer named Major William Cage must relive the worst day of his life over and over again until he can find his way out of the maze. Having refused a direct order to cover the Normandy invasion of this particular alien war from the front lines - and thats not a metaphor by the way; it actually is an invasion of Normandy a fact whose historical significance appears lost on everyone in the movie - Cage finds himself doped stripped of his rank and dumped into the infantry as an accused deserter. This time around the D-Day invasion goes a whole lot worse than the one everybody has forgotten about from 1944. (I know Maybe that never happened in this timeframe Im so far ahead of you.) The squidlike robot-fungus-""Matrix""-""Predator"" thingies from outer space who have conquered continental Europe are waiting and the days of human dominion over planet Earth are like way numbered. Oh wellHeres the thing The first time through the loud ultra-violent and bewildering carnage and chaos of the disastrous battle was tremendously exciting even though I was aware at the time that I was overdosing. Its like watching the opening sequence of ""Saving Private Ryan"" at three times normal speed while mainlining a blend of methamphetamine testosterone and death metal. I felt unable to decide between this movie is the most badass thing ever and OMG turn it off. Then Cage wakes up at the beginning of the day with some drill sergeant yelling at him and we get to watch it all over again. No its never exactly the same; stuff gets left out and other stuff added and Cage gradually groks that the key to escaping the bad acid trip is that he needs to make contact with Special Forces hotshot Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) heroine of the great human victory at Verdun. (Which is a World War I reference and not a felicitous one The 10-month Battle of Verdun in 1916 may hold the title of most pointless slaughter in human history.) You Might Also Like But a lot of its the same and much of the situational humor in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" rests on the question of how Cage will react to these endlessly recycled crises Does he supply the punch lines to his comrades gallows-humor jokes or warn them that theyre about to get shot out of the sky and slaughtered by giant whirligig beetles? Is it worth trying to save the cheerful dude who went into battle wearing only a jockstrap under his futuristic body armor and who gets squished every time around? How many iterations will it take for Cage and Rita to get off the beach alive and launched on their greater quest? One useful consequence of this endlessly rebooting video game of course is that Cruises character gets hardened and manned up from all that battlefield experience. He is transformed from a smug and callow coward into well Tom Cruise a detail-oriented stone-cold killer with a sleek veneer a clipped wit and absolutely no fear of death since death just means looping back to the morning and trying again.Theres a whole lot of superficial or mechanical cleverness to this construction whose screenplay has evidently been much reworked but is credited in final form to Christopher McQuarrie (a Cruise ally) and the team of Jez and John-Henry Butterworth (Liman allies). Hey thats not something to sneeze at Mechanical cleverness is pretty much what thrillers are about. But your reaction to ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is all about whether you can surrender to its hyper-macho action-movie fugue state and find benumbed pleasure therein. The fact that this movie is about a guy with PTSD and is also a movie that deliberately induces PTSD in the viewer may establish that Liman and his writers are more intelligent and self-aware than say Michael Bay who never requires elaborate narrative excuses to make his spectacles more and bigger. It does not however establish that their movie is better than a Michael Bay movie. If you want me to grade on a curve from inside the Hollywood paradigm then fine Of all possible movies in which Tom Cruise and a female star much younger than he charge around in silly G.I. Joe costumes from the future killing monsters while things go boom how is ""Edge of Tomorrow""? Pretty good It has enough plot density to hold your attention for a while along with a few feints at character development. You might not much notice its fundamental dishonesty and mendacity except as that odd sick feeling you have later. If on the other hand you find the combination of jittery assaultive editing and relentless all-purpose adolescent war fever disturbing and not at all pleasurable then you have already woken up from the dream and dont need to experience this overamped spectacle even once.

Entertainment ""Edge Of Tomorrow"" Is The Best Video Game Movie Thats Not Actually Based On A Video Game Tom Cruise lives life on repeat in his new sci-fi film and the result is a better exploration of video game logic than any actual video game adaptations. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow. Warner Bros. ID 3061543 Video games keep looking more and more impressively like the movies but actual movies about video games remain a pretty grim scene overall. Were past the Double Dragon days but 2005s Doom 2008s Max Payne 2009s Street Fighter The Legend of Chun-Li and the efforts of Uwe Boll have kept big-screen adaptations disreputable even while Paul W. S. Andersons Resident Evil series has continued to chug along as a reliable moneymaker. Were at the point where if you werent already familiar with the Need for Speed video game series youd never know thats what the Aaron Paul racing movie from earlier this year was based on from its marketing materials. Someone at the studio level clearly decided that the trailer wouldnt benefit from touting the films ""based on the best-selling video games"" status. Edge of Tomorrow starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt and opening this Friday isnt based on a video game despite posters that make it look like it could have spawned from the latest hit first-person shooter game. But it does something thats a lot more interesting than transporting game characters over into a movie -- it embraces video game logic and gives it a human face and heart investing it with the numbness and exhaustion that come from running through the same scenario toward the same goal again and again until you get it right. ID 3060862 View this image > Emily Blunt in Edge of Tomorrow. David James/Warner Bros. ID 3063610 Edge of Tomorrow is actually based on a Japanese novel called All You Need Is Kill (a phrase that isnt quite English but is certainly more memorable than the aggressively forgettable title they ended up using). The movie which was directed by Doug Liman (Jumper) follows Cage (Tom Cruise) a former ad exec turned military officer living in a world that been invaded by an alien race labeled ""Mimics"" a breed of fast-moving tentacly things that seem to guess what mankinds next move will be before its made. Cage is the smug face of the global recruitment effort but after he enrages a general (Brendan Gleeson) he finds himself shanghaied into service as one of the soldiers preparing to invade alien-occupied France in humanitys big push to exterminate the enemy. New technology has made it so that this isnt a direct death sentence -- the soldiers have been given weaponized exoskeleton suits that according to Cages own party line require minimal training to turn recruits into warriors. But he doesnt even know how to turn the safety off when hes dumped onto the beach and into combat. The Mimics know the human forces are coming and quickly decimate the troops in a chaotic brutal sequence that feels like a reworking of the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan only with extraterrestrials. Cage has a momentary encounter with Rita (Emily Blunt) the ""angel of Verdun"" who became the mascot of the military effort after helping win the last battle -- but shes killed then he is too bathed in the blood of the Mimic he dies taking out. Then he wakes up to find out its the day before and hes just discovering his new role as a private again. ID 3063196 View this image > David James/Warner Bros. ID 3063634 Cage continues to be caught in a time loop thats made him the equivalent of a video game character with a single save point -- the morning before the attack on the beach. When he dies he goes right back to that moment and has to run through the same events from meeting the chipper but steely Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton) to getting suited up by sneering members of his assigned squadron. Like any good player he tries different variations each time pushing the boundaries of the path on which hes been set and learning the choreography and timing to keep him alive a little longer. Hes not allowed to skip through the cutscenes the way we are -- he quickly memorizes Farells speeches and the reactions from his fellow soldiers and tries impatiently to find shortcuts through conversations. He even gets to train when he figures out he can link up with Rita who has good reason to believe his stories about whats happening to him though no one else does. You get killed you start over. Its video game logic of a particularly unforgiving sort in which Cages progress cant be preserved. He can only learn more each time. And the screenplay written by Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth shows how the repetition wears down Cage and reshapes him into a tougher and more anguished man -- hes Phil from Groundhog Day but the window of time allotted to him is horrible and every time he ""resets"" as Rita calls it it hurts as much as dying tends to. ID 3063661 View this image > Brendan Gleeson David James/Warner Bros. ID 3064400 Edge of Tomorrow is so clever with its concept (until the very end which kind of throws up its hands) and its action is so well-directed that itd be forgivable for the film to skim over the emotional toll of being made to run through a traumatic battle and to watch people die over and over again. But it doesnt which gives the movie an added edge. Tom Cruise is his usual solid blockbuster leading-man self as Cage flashing that grin and guiding the character from a man ignorant and glib about combat to one forced to repeatedly experience its grittiest details. But hes outclassed by Blunt whos the movies sad-eyed soul -- and who buffed up and smudge-faced makes for a excellently compelling action heroine. Shes the one who makes the tougher choices and who maintains the steeliest spine as Rita and Cage work together the believable product of a military thats depicted with notable harshness. Cage is the smooth talker forced to actually take action while Ritas the woman of few words whos already taken multiple trips through hell herself. When Edge of Tomorrow serves up a touch of romance between the two it feels shockingly rote one of the rare moments in which it betrays its high concept in favor of whats expected between a male and female lead. Its largely a very strong summer feature that realizes and explores the concepts of another medium with intelligence and nuance -- its only toward the end when Edge of Tomorrow reveals itself as just a movie after all.

Related links By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 421pm on Thursday Jun. 05 2014 Thursday Jun. 05 2014 Thursday Jun. 05 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Who could have guessed that the first real blockbuster surprise of the summer would come in the guise of a Tom Cruise film?Especially one with a rather bland title -- Edge of Tomorrow (they might as well have just called it Generic Summer Action Movie) -- that seems to go where every sci-fi movie has gone before. Its all here time travel unreasonable aliens the fate of a fearful world resting uneasily on the shoulders of one American man. And all in 3-D of course.Yet director Doug Liman ( The Bourne Identity Mr. and Mrs. Smith) manages to combine a sense of humor and an expert eye for action into a clever twist on old formulas. In a world of predictably lead-footed empty-headed spectacle Edge of Tomorrow is surprisingly agile and quick-witted.Cruise is Cage a ranking Army officer whose specialty is public relations and advertising. His job is to sell the war not fight in it. He cant even stand the sight of blood.So when General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders him to embed with a unit in France thats part of an all-out assault on the aliens who are called Mimics Cage refuses and threatens to use his PR skills against Brigham in the equally important media war of public opinion.As payback Cage is arrested busted down to private identified as a deserter and thrown in with a squad that will be on the leading edge of the invasion. Hows that for a delicious slice of revenge pizza topped with a serving of dont-mess-with-me?In an astonishing sequence Cage is dropped into France amid total chaos and catastrophe. Panicked and afraid hes useless as a soldier and is killed by an especially cantankerous multitentacled Mimic.But then he wakes up -- back in time just after his arrest with the invasion still a day away. What fresh hell is this? Is he doomed to repeat these same awful moments for eternity? And who is this mysterious super soldier Rita (Emily Blunt) and her scientist sidekick (Noah Taylor) who seem to be clued in to whats going on?Based on the novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka Edge of Tomorrow is Groundhog Day with weaponry. But its effective as Liman (working from a script by Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth) keeps things moving fast enough that theres no time to nitpick the implausibilities -- like forcing a totally untrained soldier into battle where his mistakes could get everyone killed except the enemy.But Liman has fun with the time-shifting premise and makes an impressive use of 3-D technology. Meanwhile Cruise -- in the beginning at least when hes not in implacable Mission Impossible mode -- shows off some welcome vulnerability and Bill Paxton seems to relish his role as Cages unforgiving commanding officer. Edge of Tomorrow isnt as thought-provoking as the similarly plotted Source Code Duncan Jones 2011 film about a man forced to repeat a calamitous event until he gets the right outcome. Not only that but Edge doesnt end as well as it begins. And to paraphrase an old dictum Directors who dont learn from history -- like their hapless heroes in sci-fi movies -- are doomed to repeat it.But in Limans case that has turned out to be not such a bad thing.

Photo Credit AP / Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT To win a war against an alien species one human soldier must relive the day he dies. (Rated PG-13 for violence language) BOTTOM LINE Intense action dull characters stellar effects and sloppy logic make for one maddening mix. Mostly entertaining finally exasperating. CAST Tom Cruise Emily Blunt Brendan Gleeso LENGTH 153 Have you been waiting for a World War II movie starring Tom Cruise as a time traveler saving Earth from space aliens? If so youre in luck because ""Edge of Tomorrow"" fits the bill and even throws in Emily Blunt as Joan of Arc. The rest of us will be mystified by this big-screen adaptation of the Japanese novel ""All You Need Is Kill."" Its a dazzlingly directed and often intense blockbuster bolstered by the dependably committed Cruise still a terrific action figure at 51. But ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is also thematically garbled poorly plotted and almost totally incoherent. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? A few salient plot points might help. While Earths United Defense Front battles the Mimics -- giant spider-squids that move with lightning speed -- General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders Army spokesman William Cage (Cruise) to the front. Under the command of Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton) and strapped into an exosuit Cage is killed -- but wakes to live and learn once more. Gradually like a young Pac-Man prodigy he memorizes the precise pattern to survive. He also learns that the famous soldier Rita Vrataski (Blunt tricked out with breastplate and sword) understands whats happening. Together they -- and a squad of lovable losers -- must solve the puzzle and stop the Mimics. None of this explains why the movie is set on the beach at Verdun or why Cage plots to destroy a German dam or why an Army publicist would be reduced to cannon fodder in the first place. The thrilling direction by Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"") and the occasionally witty script (co-written by Christopher McQuarrie of ""The Usual Suspects"") may keep you so entertained that you wont care. 146 MoviesEdge of Tomorrow review For the moment at least. But eventually the movie spins out of control and crashes into an illogical heap. Its fun for a while but ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is what the GIs used to call a blivet -- 10 pounds of movie in a five-pound bag. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT To win a war against an alien species one human soldier must relive the day he dies.

PICTURES By MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Edge of TomorrowStarring Tom Cruise Emily Blunt Bill Paxton Brendan Gleeson Directed by Doug Liman Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and adventure language and brief suggestive material Running time 1 hour 53 minutes Playing In wide releaseThe quick hit With a clever buildup an increasingly monotonous midsection and little emotional payoff this hybrid of ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Starship Troopers"" features Tom Cruise at his most likable several bravura sequences and the charismatic Emily Blunt. Grade B- Tom Cruises latest sci-fi adventure ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is actually the movie past revisited a global ""Groundhog Day"" featuring alien squids instead of a burrowing rodent. Cruise plays Major William Cage a cowardly American publicity officer caught in a hazardous time loop. The role is good for Cruise. Doubt and uncertainty humanize him especially when hes encased without training in high-tech battle armor and tossed against the tentacles of otherworldly killers. When he must play other qualities - including ardent devotion to the wars battle heroine the inspirational fighter Rita Vrataski (the incandescent Emily Blunt) - his performance falters and the script seems like yesterdays news. In the opening scene Cage out of wimpiness refuses an order to record the decisive battle between the Mimics and mankinds United Defense Force on the front lines (for PR purposes). Pressed into service as a grunt he barely gets his ExoSuit up and running before he uses its arsenal to kill an Alpha Mimic - just at the moment it kills him. Then a funny thing happens on his way to oblivion. He wakes up. He opens his eyes on the morning before the battle in the troop transport area where he was dragooned into a misfit combat squad. He endures the same military black comedy he did before - including pitiless hazing from his hardened combat mates and blistering verbal assaults from a sergeant with a lethal smile (the great Bill Paxton) - and goes through similar carnage on the beach. He again gets killed and recalled to life. With repetition he improves his battle skills and tries to change the outcome of what could be a suicide mission. Only after Vrataski known as ""the Full Metal Bitch"" asks him to ""come find me when you wake up"" does he realize whats been happening to him. It sounds complicated. Its really elementary my dear moviegoer and equally derivative of ""Starship Troopers"" as well as ""Groundhog Day."" This is the sort of film that needs every surprise it can spring on you. Lets just say Cage learns that the Alpha Mimic gore that spilled on him gave him the ability to reset time. Its a gift developed by the Omega - the Queen Bee of the Mimics hive and the controller of its group brain - to preserve her Alpha heroes. When bathed in the Alpha Mimics vital fluids Cage also absorbs the power to gain mental glimpses of the mysterious Omega. Will he eventually give Vrataskis mad-scientist friend Dr. Carter (Noah Taylor) enough information to locate the Omega? Will Cage and Vrataski find a way to sweep past the massacre on the beach and go on to kill the Omega before the Mimics overrun humanity? At first director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"") working as the Omega for a hive of screenwriters counterpoints the suspense with brutal black farce especially when Vrataski takes charge of training Cage and triggering his time-loop repetitions. Liman stages blocks of action in ways that stick in your memory so the gimmick gets spiffier and funnier the tighter he clips the instant replays. This director is playful enough to make jokes out of Cages Sisyphus-like tests and to engage in perception games with the audience staying a few steps ahead of viewers just when they think theyre on top of the latest shifts in the action. But his playfulness wears out and when all the gimmickry must pay off the film devolves into action tropes that are uninspired and occasionally incoherent. I like the idea of bringing J Squad back for a roller-coaster climax; I also liked that J Squad made me think of F Troop. But the movie gives them next to nothing to do. What stays with you are Cruises off-type performance a few bravura sequences - including an anti-E.T. airborne variation on D-Days Normandy landing - and Blunts molten presence. Her execution of an ""iso-pushup"" may do for her what two slithery crawls did for Catherine Zeta-Jones in ""Entrapment."" (Along with the general storyline the ""iso-pushup"" is one of the few things picked up from the source book the Japanese novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka.) She could have been given a better running joke than asking whether she has ""something on my face"" but maybe that plays funnier in Japanese since its also in the book. Blunt suggests the vestiges of feeling beneath Vrataskis forbidding martial-goddess allure. She has a passionate brusqueness in command and a charged sometimes hilarious deadpan when shes stationary. Until the film falls apart in its third act she never cedes an inch of battlefield authority to Cruises Cage. No performer has ever looked more at ease with a sword. No co-star has ever exhibited keener Cruise control.

Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Breathlessly exciting wildly entertaining ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a wake-up call to makers of formulaic alien-invasion thrillers. Its also a reminder of why Tom Cruise is a big movie star. Heres a light-speed-paced science-fiction blockbuster seething with white-hot combat percolating with intelligence and erupting with wicked humor when we need a breather. Which is often. In the near-ish future Europe has fallen to the Mimics extraterrestrial cephalopods the size of automobiles racing along on their tentacles like cyclones of squid-ink pasta. The opening frames the aliens arrival as a developing TV news story and the movie maintains that feeling of ground-level immediacy throughout. Following a series of bloody retreats Allied armies are massing outside London preparing an attack that seems sure to repel the curiously dormant alien hordes. The set-up is routine. Its the execution thats daring. We see the human counterattack which runs into unexpected trouble from the perspective of one recruit experiencing the disastrous battle again and again in a time loop. That would be Cruise in his best performance since ""Jerry Maguire."" He plays Maj. William Cage the U.S. militarys PR man who has successfully packaged and sold the uphill war to the public with empty platitudes. He is a self-serving coward -- ""parasitic scum"" as one character puts it. When he blackmails a general to avoid leading a camera crew onto the beach at Normandy hes stripped of his rank and tossed into a combat unit headed for battle. On hearing the news Cruise breaks into one of his trademark gallops -- this time away from the fight. On the battlefield things go predictably wrong for this weasel who perishes amid a cataclysmic blast-o-rama of exploding aircraft mangled bodies and severed limbs. Then things go unexpectedly weird. Because his blood is contaminated with a rare form of plasma from a dying alien Cage travels a temporal Mobius strip. Every time hes killed his life begins again that morning. Each time the deceased Cage wakes up he knows hes fresh meat for the grinder. And this tenderfoot who cant locate the safety release on his blaster gets killed a lot. EDGE OF TOMORROW  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence language and brief suggestive material. With more reboots than a cobblers shop Cage gradually transforms from groveling weakling to battle leader. On that journey he needs the tutelage of Sgt. Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt 50 degrees cooler than usual). Shes a steely combat hero hourglass-figured and resolute in battle armor that suggests a high-tech dominatrix. Shes also one of the few people with reason to believe Cages insane-sounding story. Can you follow this? Trust me it doesnt matter. The film finds the ideal tone to tell its tale. The script (co-written by Christopher McQuarrie who dreamed up ""The Usual Suspects"") mines the situation for sublime gallows humor. Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"") directs the darkly comic ridiculously bloody action and quieter character moments with precision. Cruises early reincarnations are awful (but awfully funny) dead-man-walking jokes. Later when he re-enters the slaughter with polished combat skills his fellow recruits gape at his prowess. The movie parcels out information cunningly as we move alongside Cruise. Every so often his character knows more about whats going on than we do -- hes back from the future in every scene after all -- and those moments are a kick in the pants. There are fine cameos from Bill Paxton as a sergeant who barks his orders in an arch literary tone and Brendan Gleeson as the allies supreme commander. This is Cruises show beginning to end though and hes wonderful. His seasick expression of anxiety his stiff-jointed waddle in his military exoskeleton his look of incredulity on his early reincarnations all show us the shadow side of an actor too often trapped in superman roles. Theres not a proper love story here but the warming relationship between the slippery Cage and flinty Vrataski is solid and important to the plot. When Cage begins to value Vrataskis life above his own his combat strategy has to change accordingly. Cruise is magnetic even at the beginning of his zero-to-hero arc and as for The Grin it has never been deployed better. And never more infectious.

After all the time loop set-up of the sci-fi action movie starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt as allies in humankinds battle against seemingly invincible aliens known as Mimics recalls 1993s comedy ""Groundhog Day"" Only instead of an arrogant TV weatherman learning to be a better human as he repeats the day again and again we have Maj. William Cage a former ad exec turned Army information liaison who must become a soldier. Or as Blunts ace warrior Rita Vrataski says a ""weapon."" Its a process. Directed by Doug Liman the film is actually based on Hiroshi Sakurazakas novel with the grammatically confounding title ""All You Need Is Kill."" (Um OK. Thanks for the anti-McCartney-Lennon sentiment?) Needless to say Earths near future is once again a lousy place overrun with invading alien hordes that look like hyper-fast toothy mollusks. The movies clever tagline is ""Live. Die. Repeat."" And Cage dies. A lot. Those deaths -- at the vicious tentacles of aliens or due to Ritas point-blank friendly fire -- almost always provide the comic relief in this otherwise battle-scarred flick. More than a few times Cage awakens from his death a bus sailing by with a billboard of Ritas defiant visage peering down. If you believe in the military the notion of a general sending the wholly unprepared if inadvisably cocky Cage into a major offensive seems unnecessarily cynical. Still the look Gen. Bingham (Brendan Gleeson) gives Cage as he tries to manipulate his way out of being embedded with a combat unit at the start of the film is priceless. Before Cage is sent to the front hes Jerry Maguire prior to the food poison before the epiphany before the mission statement before the humbling. Bill Paxton wearing a tight little moustache locates an incendiary zeal as Master Sgt. Farrell. He relishes introducing Cage to the motley mix of soldiers hell be deploying with come drop time. Its a relief when a renewed Cage begins anticipating whats next if only not to hear more of Farrells pseudo-noble bloviating. Action movies are often likened to video games usually because of their unbridled gunplay and fantasy-high body counts. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" actually mimics the pedagogic pleasures of gaming more than most. Cage is like a player constantly trying to learn the patterns of his foe trying to remember the lethal hazards for the next go-round. Alas Cage and Rita arent the only ones anticipating next moves. Its all a little mind-bending. And thats a fine thing. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is not as inventive as Rian Johnsons time-bending noir ""Looper"" (in which Blunt has a significant role). Nor is it as surprisingly spiritual as ""Groundhog Day."" But it whirls with energy. And the muscular determination of its leads gives us two warriors worth pulling for -- again and again and again.

Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt live die and repeat again and again in a fight for humanitys survival. Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1108 a.m. MST June 6 2014Tom Cruise is in winning form in Doug Limans film about a soldier killed in battle who relives the day again and again learning more along the way. Smart funny and entertaining.Tom Cruise in a scene from ""Edge of Tomorrow.""(Photo Warner Bros.)Story HighlightsCritics review 4 starsThe story based on the Japanese novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" never skimps on intelligence or humor.Emily Blunt is good Cruise even better though their chemistry is necessarily muted.The film is like Cruises character Whatever rough patches it hits it soldiers on with a smile.""Edge of Tomorrow"" repeats itself without being repetitive takes itself seriously while providing some laughs and offers plenty of action without short-changing us on the intelligence front.Neat tricks all courtesy of director Doug Liman. His film is a terrific summer entertainment and it gives us another chance to note that Tom Cruise for whatever you may think of his antics off-screen remains an underrated actor on-screen.JUNE MOVIE GUIDE Avoid the heat and take a seat in theatersIn the future an alien race has attacked Earth. The creatures called Mimics have their way with humanity until a battle in France in which a lightly trained woman named Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) leads the United Defense Force to a stunning victory earning the nickname ""Angel of Verdun"" (along with more colorful titles).Ritas success is just what UDF public-relations officer William Cage (Cruise) needs to persuade more people to enlist. Cage is arrogant and slick a born salesman traits that Cruise has been playing for years and still pulls off with ease. (OK maybe its not even acting. Whatever the case its convincing.)But Gen. Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) proves pretty wily too and orders Cage into battle as a PR stunt. Cage argues that he isnt a soldier not really but you dont get to be the commander of UDF troops by compromising. Cage soon is on the front lines part of a huge D-Day-like invasion (on a beach in France no less) -- for a couple of minutes until hes slaughtered along with the rest of the UDF soldiers Rita included.Then a weird thing happens Cage wakes up on the base where he was deposited and begins the previous day over where he will again face off with Master Sgt. Farell (Bill Paxton) and be led into battle with similarly disastrous results.Yes it sounds like a violent ""Groundhog Day"" and no thats not the only movie it cribs from. But its such an entertaining mashup of ideas so beautifully executed so who cares?The cycle repeats with Cage gradually learning from his mistakes making it a little further each day till hes killed -- and saving Rita who during one day tells him to find her when he wakes up.He does and she has the explanation for Cages ability to reset the day. And she thinks she knows how to use this power to defeat the enemy. It will require Cage to perform like a real soldier; during the films most-entertaining segment she leads him through grueling training sessions and shows him how to fight. When hes injured she simply kills him and they begin the day again.This could have been dull or repetitive but Liman strikes just the right balance between comedy and drama with deaths that are sometimes gruesome sometimes necessary (he has to die to reset the day; a grave wound wont do it) and sorry sometimes just funny.Its a great chance for Cruise to remind us why people used to like him so much in the first place. He makes the transition from snotty superior to selfless soldier in convincing form and he still has that million-dollar smile. Blunts good too but their chemistry is necessarily muted for much of the movie. Shes a fighter not a lover as Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney never used to say.The ending as is so often the case in films like this doesnt quite live up to the rest of the movie. Its tough getting out of a scenario like this. But its not bad and its certainly good enough not to besmirch the fun of whats gone before it. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" (based on a Hiroshi Sakurazaka novel with a much better title ""All You Need Is Kill"") never slows down enough for complaint. Like our newly dedicated hero when the film hits a rough patch it simply soldiers on.Review Edge of Tomorrow 4 starsDirector Doug Liman.Cast Tom Cruise Emily Blunt Bill Paxton.Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence language and brief suggestive material.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Pictures photo A hero does the time warp in Edge of Tomorrow By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Jun 5 2014 (...) Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt in ""Edge of Tomorrow."" Warner Bros. Pictures photo Whenever I walk into a theater I ask myself two questions ""What is this movie about?"" and ""Does it involve Adam Sandler?"" After Im satisfied that the answer to the second question is no I can concentrate on the story (followed by the acting and the directing and all that other stuff).On rare occasions I may have to see a movie a second time to appreciate the clues that say Bruce Willis is actually a dead guy. But I suspect that if I had nine lifetimes I still wouldnt understand the sci-fi flick ""Edge of Tomorrow."" And it isnt some mystical mind-blower like ""2001 A Space Odyssey""; its just basically a battlebots movie with a malfunctioning game clock.Without clues like flying cars and melting ice caps I can only guess that this story is set in the very near future when tentacled aliens will descend on Europes most photogenic cities. The best hope for Battlefield Earth is Cage (Tom Cruise). Technically a major in an international defense force Cage is a specialist in public relations (i.e. propaganda). He arrives at HQ in London expecting to write a story about an imminent counteroffensive and he declines a chance to fight on the front lines because hes a bit of a coward. Thats a novel premise for a Cruise movie; but soon hes reluctantly tossed into battle like the rookie from ""The Red Badge of Courage."" And then the strangest thing happens.As soon as the feckless foot soldier gets turned into hamburger he gets jolted back to the barracks where he hears the same rah-rah speech about glorious sacrifice dons the same armored skeleton and takes the same kamikaze plunge into battle.And then again. And again. Sexy supersolider Rita (Emily Blunt) realizes that Cage is infected with alien blood that allows him to skip backward a few hours and amend his mistakes -- because she had the same power. Now that shes lost it she must train Cage to be the ultimate warrior even if it means repeatedly killing him.The trouble with time-travel and alternate-reality movies is that they imply an immortality which drains the tension from immediate events. And in this particular flick director Doug Liman doesnt place his time traveler in a social or interpersonal context we care about. Theres some amusing moments when the awakening groundhog thumbs his nose at the shadows but the closest we get to a rooting interest is when Cage flirts with Rita before returning to fight the aliens. By design its monotonous and with so much clunky hardware Liman cant generate the same pace he produced in the ""Bourne"" movies. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" has neither an edge nor a vision of tomorrow that matters today.What ""Edge of Tomorrow""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 153  Content Intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence language and brief suggestive material Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Edge of Tomorrow review Cruise keeps coming back for more 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Edge of Tomorrow Action. Starring Tom Cruise Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton. Directed by Doug Liman. (PG-13. 113 minutes.) The Earth is being invaded by space aliens and only Tom Cruise stands between us and complete annihilation. Yes weve been there before but ""Edge of Tomorrow"" covers familiar ground with unexpected wit and economy and the result is a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi fantasy. The film is based on the Japanese novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" in which a young recruit dies in his first battle but because of some twist in the system he keeps coming back to relive his last 24 hours increasing his survival skills with each return. Adapting the story for Cruise the screenwriters devise a more compelling situation - and one with a touch of comedy Cruise plays a spokesman for the militarys public relations department a middle-aged major with no combat experience who is forced to hit the beaches as part of a landing force. As the film starts the aliens occupy most of Europe and an implacable Irish general (Brendan Gleeson) is planning a make-or-break D-Day type invasion for the following day. Cruise as the confident telegenic major is talking breezily and on seemingly equal terms with the general when he finds out that he is being embedded with the first wave of troops. More in Movies Test review Drama dance mix in time of AIDS crisis Fault in Our Stars review Beauty and manipulation Night Moves review Ecoterrorism from an odd angle Its the kind of comic scene made for Cruise. Struggling to stay on his game he tries charming the general making jokes flashing his big smile - while the general looks at him as if hes a worm. As a last resort he tries threats and ends up demoted to private and put on the front line. Director Doug Liman lavishes time on these early scenes and theyre crucial in the way they ground the movie in its world and establish a bond between audience and protagonist. The major starts off as the viewers surrogate an entirely sympathetic spectator to horror. Were with him for the beach landing which isnt by boat but by airplane with the soldiers jumping out of the bottom wearing armor and suspended by cords. Its the familiar terror and chaos augmented by futuristic technology. By getting killed and coming back over and over the major soon grasps two things First the aliens wanted the invasion and had an ambush ready and second his ability to come back again and again might be the only edge humanity has in this war. This leads to a collaboration with the heroine of the special forces played by a tough and grim Emily Blunt. Though the time is constantly resetting ""Edge of Tomorrow"" consistently has a feeling of forward motion even momentum and the filmmakers always keep things clear so that viewers always know exactly where they are in the story. In a way the film schools us in how to watch it so that at our most advanced we can catch on as to whether a scene is of the characters doing something for the first time or the 20th. The gimmicks of repetition and time travel make for comic opportunities which the movie exploits without losing the serious thread. Likewise as the major grows in knowledge and becomes someone who knows about the fates of others there are poignant moments as well. All these are harmonized nicely into one flow and one vision by the director. Though Liman is best known for action movies (""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" ""The Bourne Identity"") he started his career with edgy comedies such as ""Swingers"" and ""Go."" You can see some of that acerbic comic touch in the performances of Bill Paxton whose Master Sergeant has a hint of surreal mania and Gleeson whose deadpan as the commanding general is equally funny and alarming. We come to see them as the major sees them as exaggerated figures stuck in the illusion of time. Cruise is a delight exactly what he needs to be fluid enough for comedy physical enough for action always going with the flow and yet finding ways to make moments memorable. Like Clark Gable a few generations ago Cruise has maintained his stardom for three decades now rarely ever making a great movie but rarely making a bomb. At a certain point all these pretty good good and very good movies cant be a coincidence. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

James Bridges/Twentieth Century Fox Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday June 5 2014 Follow AnnHornaday Its so easy to be glib in dismissing summer blockbusters Theyve gotten too big too loud too dependent on slick computer effects and too dismissive of fusty ideas like narrative and character arc. How depressing the routine has become watching otherwise gifted stars squander their talents on the altar of the lowest common denominator. Then something like ""Edge of Tomorrow"" comes along and it looks like theres still hope. A crafty clever stylish science-fiction action adventure this time-travel loop-de-loop didnt have to be this good. But thanks to the efforts of a superb creative team and Tom Cruise -- here deploying his own persona with stunning self-awareness and humor -- what might have been a throwaway genre exercise instead turns out to be a surprisingly satisfying day-after-day-after-day at the movies. Synopsis is not our friend when it comes to summing up ""Edge of Tomorrow"" whose title was mercifully changed from the dreadful ""All You Need Is Kill"" (the name of the Japanese novel its based on). Cruise plays Maj. William Cage a media relations officer with the U.S. Army of the very near future when Europe has been overrun with an alien force of huge hissing squid-like dervishes. When Cage is unexpectedly drafted into a platoon readying to invade France he blanches Hes a coward all too ready to use his disarming grin and ad-man charms to get out of any real danger. Instead Cage is plopped down at Forward Operating Base Heathrow in London where hes outfitted with a computerized exoskeleton that turns him into a rock em sock em robot. Also training at the base is a world-famous special forces soldier named Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) known as the Angel of Verdun for her heroics at that eponymous alien battle. The two eventually cross paths with Cage being tossed into a repetitive and deadly time loop that resembles a cross between ""Groundhog Day"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Wile E. Coyotes worst morning ever. If that last reference suggests a note of antic physical humor thats because ""Edge of Tomorrow"" which has been brilliantly adapted by brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth and Christopher McQuarrie pops with moments of welcome unexpected levity. This especially comes through when Cage begins to grok whats happening to him and starts to riff and rush along encounters that hes been through dozens of times before. Aided by the crackerjack cutting prowess of editor James Herbert director Doug Liman skillfully conveys the endless repetition without making ""Edge of Tomorrow"" repetitive itself. He quickly and often amusingly cuts to the chase of each sequence during each of which Cage tries to nudge reality just a bit further in the direction of survival and saving the world before he dies and has to start all over again. As light as ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is on its feet it still manages to balance that fleetness with visceral impressively staged battle sequences. Borrowing nomenclature and visual language from classic World War II films the film re-imagines D-Day as a high-tech aerial assault on Normandy with terrifying tentacled creatures rising out of the waters and flaming shards of planes crashing down on their own human cargo. The tableau is gruesome and intense with Cage initially a passive horrified victim and then eventually an agent in a carefully ritualized study in fate human nature and the possibility of growth and change. Like the classic war films it lovingly quotes ""Edge of Tomorrow"" even has a ragtag group of misfits in this case the battle-scarred squad that Cage is thrown into over and over again by his drawling master sergeant played with a barely discernible wink by Bill Paxton. (When Cage notes from his Southern accent that hes obviously American Paxton flawlessly barks back ""No sir Im from Kentucky"") But the centerpiece of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is the burgeoning relationship between Cage and Rita whom Blunt invests with just the right mix of machisma and soulfulness. (Between this ""The Adjustment Bureau"" and ""Looper"" shes apparently the go-to girl when it comes to busting the time-space continuum.) Even with Blunt charismatically holding her own the undisputed star of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is Cruise who as the storys reluctant hero delivers a one-man master class in his own fascinatingly protean screen presence. Starting out as a shallow cocksure sharpie ""Jerry Maguire"" -- even sporting some ""Risky Business"" baby fat -- he smoothly navigates the myriad tiny transformations that Cage goes through until he becomes the flinty competent steely-eyed saver-of-the-day that his ""Mission Impossible"" years have taught us to expect. Whats more he earns every beat in a performance that calls on him to undergo all manner of physical punishments and slapstick indignities. Like summer movies themselves its become so easy to be glib in dismissing Tom Cruise. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" provides welcome and hugely entertaining evidence that hes still a star of considerable gifts and savvy enough not to let them be squandered just yet.    PG-13. At area theaters.

"Edge of Tomorrow | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; edge-of-tomorrow ) Edge of Tomorrow (United States/Australia 2014) June 05 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli As improbable a concoction as it might seem Edge of Tomorrow is a curious mix of ingredients from the 1993 Harold Ramis/Bill Murray comedy Groundhog Day and James Camerons 1986 sequel to Alien. An Earth-versus-aliens tale set in the near future Edge of Tomorrow offers a time travel twist to its proceedings. Unlike many movies that toy with journeys through the fourth dimension this one doesnt dwell on paradoxes and at least until a tacked-on epilogue plays by its own rules. Like last years Oblivion Edge of Tomorrow gives Tom Cruise an opportunity to play an action/hero role in a science fiction playground. Because the script is smarter (based on a Japanese graphic novel called ""All You Need is Kill"" by Hiroshi Sakurazaka) Edge of Tomorrow offers a more satisfying cinematic experience than Oblivion. Edge of Tomorrow uses the popular faux news footage montage to set up the story. Earth has been invaded by extraterrestrials dubbed the ""mimics"" and all of Europe is in enemy hands. After losing battle after battle the United Defense Forces have finally scored a victory at Verdun. Emboldened by the armys success General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) has decided on an all-out assault led by war hero and media darling Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt). To ""sell"" the attack to the planet Brigham enlists the talents of army publicist Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) who he intends to send to the front line with a camera crew. Cage unwilling to put his life on the line refuses the direct order and ends up being busted in rank on trumped up charges thrown into an infantry unit and sent into the thick of the fighting. When set upon by a member of a special mimic subspecies Cage uses an explosive to destroy the creature. In the process he kills himselfa| then awakens back at the beginning of his ordeal and has to endure the entire day another time. He dies again is reborn again and the cycle persists. Its dA(c)jA  vu without end. Each time Cage is able to use his memories of the battle to survive longer until he eventually contacts Rita and learns that she knows something about his situation. ""Come find me when you wake up"" she tells him before they are both killed. Few things in a movie can get older faster than repetition. No one wants to watch the same scene even with variations over and over and over. To overcome this hurdle director Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity) borrows some of the tricks employed by Ramis in Groundhog Day - showing just enough of a scene to make it clear were in another iteration of the loop then skipping ahead to the point when things start to change. This keeps everything flowing and discourages a flagging of the momentum. It also allows for moments of gallows humor. Those who dont care for Tom Cruise may derive some satisfaction from this aspect of the screenplay Cage is killed several hundred times during the course of Edge of Tomorrow. Visually the film which transpires in London has its share of impressive moments although the special effects dont completely dominate. The 3-D makes good use of spatial relationships but unfortunately degrades the darker scenes. The main thrust of Edge of Tomorrow focuses on Cages use of his immortality/time reset ability to locate the aliens ""brain"" and find a way to win the war. Thats straightforward; whats more subtle and potentially more interesting is how the relationship between Cage and Rita develops. Each time they meet Ritas interaction with Cage is reset from her perspective. She doesnt know him. For him however its the continuation of a growing relationship. He becomes familiar with her to the point where he develops deep feelings. For her however hes always a stranger. The growing disparity between how they view each other fuels their interplay later in the story. Reticence conflicts with intimacy. The part of Cage is in Cruises wheelhouse; he could probably do this kind of role in his sleep. The one out on a limb is Emily Blunt whose kick-ass interpretation of Rita recalls a couple of strong James Cameron heroines Sigourney Weavers Ripley and Linda Hamiltons Sarah Connor. Blunt who often does ""softer"" roles is credible as the Hero of Verdun. Brendan Gleeson as the general in charge of the war and Bill Paxton as Cages commanding officer are both excellent in supporting roles. Movies that employ time travel as a plot device often become exercises in mental agility. Thats not the case with Edge of Tomorrow which uses a straightforward approach. The explanation for Cages ability is explained in a clear uncluttered fashion and the manner in which his days unfold are no more confusing than those in Groundhog Day. Theres plenty of action and despite the fact that much of it is repeated it never becomes repetitive. Edge of Tomorrow is clever enough that the viewer doesnt have to feel embarrassed sitting in the audience but not so clever that theres no fun to be had.

By contrast ""Edge of Tomorrow""--an original science fiction concept (admittedly based on the novel ""All You Need is Kill"") starring one of the worlds biggest stars--arrives with the aura of a welcome retreat from redundant formulas. The flashy movie finds ""Bourne Identity"" director Doug Liman tackling his grandest-scale production to date a futuristic scenario in which Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) finds himself suck in a loop on the battlefield with an invasive alien species --he relives the same day again and again experiencing the same events each time out. His only source of support comes in the form of a hardened general (Emily Blunt) who once experienced the exact same phenomenon and recognizes it as an an ability absorbed from the aliens themselves. After the third or fourth repeat she figures out his conundrum and the two join forces in a loopy battle to locate the aliens power source--naturally mandating that Tom Cruise must die many times over in the process. One could easily view ""Edge of Tomorrow"" as a symbolic criticism of commercial filmmaking The majors conundrum which finds Cruise battling through a CGI-laden battle field many times over echoes the mechanical hack-and-slash process of the Hollywood studio system--which throws the same idea at the wall time and again with brutal efficiency hoping against hope that something will stick. But no matter what happens the process is self-defeating until somebody comes up with a fresh way forward. Ironically its the accumulation of these repeated moments that make ""Edge of Tomorrow"" into an enjoyable ride--but its originality has some limitations. Its impossible not to observe the explicit borrowing from ""Groundhog Day"" an infinitely wiser and more astute storytelling accomplishment. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is slick but once its fancy plot dressing takes form it has little more to offer aside from a few impressive action sequences and the infallible grin of its nimble lead. The movie works just fine as a mild distraction but arrives in theaters with a fanfare that suggests a far grander achievement. Thats largely because it benefits from a contrast with its competition. Now that the Wachowskis ""Jupiter Rising"" has been pushed to next year ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is indeed the most original science fiction blockbuster of the summer but there are much stronger options on a smaller scale. Chief among them is ""Coherence"" which hits theaters in New York and Los Angeles on June 20th. Joining ""Primer"" and ""Timecrimes"" as one of the best time-bending science fiction movies of the past 10 years writer-director James Ward Byrkits supremely clever and economical comedy-drama finds a group of friends trapped in a war with alternate versions of themselves when a passing comet merges their universes during a dinner party. Even as its goofy characters constant frustration and confusion over their predicament gives the material a jovial quality ""Coherence"" doesnt fully rest in their befuddled state. And it offers plenty of existential treats as characters sneak out to witness their alternate selves and struggle to determine a means of surviving the night (before every possible reality collapses into a singularity). Byrkits brilliantly labyrinthine script contains an internal logic that allows this inventive narrative to resurrect the joy of unpacking non-linear events -- last achieved to such a great degree with ""Memento."" Seeing it once doesnt do justice to the prospects of analyzing its confounding series of overlapping incidents. ""Coherence"" allows viewers to relish in the fun while providing payoff for those who dig deeper. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" on the other hand doesnt bother to address its scenario in literal terms. Once its clear that each time the major bites the bullet he reawakens on the same military base Liman speeds up events with a series of repeated incidents that suggest he undergoes the same battlefield experience hundreds of times. As much as the movie has fun with prospects of killing off Cruise--frankly it holds back more on the details than you might expect--it turns his experience into an ellipsis once the basic pieces have been assembled Yeah you get it he dies a lot. Lets move on. While that approach worked marvelously in ""Groundhog Day"" to evoke the characters omniscient awareness of his life in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" its a bland excuse to speed things up. Like many movies made on its scale one can sense the germ of an innovative idea never fully coming to fruition. Its worth noting that this isnt even the first riff on ""Groundhog Day"" to premiere in theaters this year; the delightfully raunchy comedy ""Premature"" which IFC Films midnight label will release on July 2 involves a klutzy teen whose day restarts each time he ejaculates. (Being a hormonal teen that means his day restarts a whole lot.) Writer-director Dan Beers genial comedy uses the scenario to explore the frustrations of teen desire particularly the way hormonal energy runs counter to the dry routine of daily life The time cycle assailing its protagonist is silly and relatable at the same time. But while ""Premature"" received a mixed response following its SXSW Film Festival premiere partly because its sexual humor was considered too sophomoric (which you know is the point) ""Edge of Tomorrow"" has been embraced as a significant achievement in the crowdpleasing summer movie mold. Thats not just overselling the movie in question; its underselling the possibilities of movies in general. Of course its tough to develop sophisticated ideas on a broad scale. Last years big high concept event movie Guillermo del Toros ""Pacific Rim"" mostly confounded American audiences and it wasnt even that complicated--just different from the usual form of lumbering raucous Hollywood product. ""World War Z"" managed to smarten up the zombie genre but hardly broke new ground in that respect. Only Alfonso Cuarons ""Gravity"" charted out a bracing new approach to producing spectacles based on original material but it was released in the fall as an awards contender--instead of sending a message about the value of smartening up the summer period the epicenter of blockbuster releases. This is not a time of year when studios like to take risks. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" may generate the expectations of innovative escapism but its ultimately just a lively demonstration of the same beats weve seen many times before Tom Cruise running and running and running with no real guarantee that the journey will ever end.

Reply matt May 12 2016 1141 am (WARNING SPOILERS) On the one hand Kohns interpretation of ""Edge"" as criticizing the ""sameness"" of Hollywood action films may seem like a stretch. On the other hand it is interesting that the aliens are called ""mimics"" that are all controlled by a single source(maybe like hollywood?). To ramble on further the brain that controls all the mimics is located in the Lourve art mueseum. Has classic art been replaced by giant mechanical mimicry? And yet Im pretty sure this summer blockbuster isnt seeking to express a deeper message. Its still a cool movie though Reply Eli May 12 2016 1141 am Im seeing references to Ground Hog Day in a lot of the Edge of Tomorrow reviews (and a lot of raised eyebrows at Original although I get the technical definition) but isnt the premise of EoT much closer to Source Code? Reply Hemant May 12 2016 1141 am Tainting a good movie and showing some silly movies as better options Edge of Tomorrow is definitely doing good in terms of positive reviews among a minority of biased reviews like yours. Those having a working brain would surely give it a B+ or A which it deserves. A fail attempt Reply TAW May 12 2016 1141 am World War Z was in no way a zombie film it did have zombies in it. Reply kpkwrtr May 12 2016 1141 am Um ""Edge Of Tomorrow"" is not an ""original science fiction concept"". It is based on the fairly popular novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" which was also the working title of the film.

"Edge of Tomorrow review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Review Edge of Tomorrow Tom Cruises Groundhog Day isnt Shakespeare but its funJune 05 2014|Michael PhillipsEmily Blunt left as Rita and Tom Cruise as Cage in Warner Bros. Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures sci-fi thriller ""Edge of Tomorrow."" (Warner Bros. Pictures/MCT)Insanely derivative frenetically enjoyable ""Edge of Tomorrow"" takes gaming to a new level of big-screen indulgence sending Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt through the same alien-invasion scenario over and over until they learn how to win put down the consoles and get off the couch for a little lunch and some fresh air maybe.The film is based on a Japanese graphic novel ""All You Need is Kill."" It owes a tremendous amount of its structure and appeal to ""Groundhog Day"" with parts of ""Tremors"" ""Starship Troopers"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the underrated ""Source Code"" grafted onto its hull. Director Doug Liman has engineered exactly what Cruises character refers to in the prologue a ""large mechanized invasion"" with a 3-D up-charge."" Im not sure ""Edge of Tomorrow"" holds much repeat viewing potential among teenage movie consumers since the movies a self-repeating entity to begin with. But once is fun.Time loops are handy storytelling tools adaptable to all sorts of fantasies. Also theyre funny; when a disoriented protagonist learns how to exploit the reset button and improve his chances at survival a dire situation suddenly gets a shot of levity.The looper here is Maj. William Cage played by Cruise a media-relations spin doctor and former advertising man untrained in combat. In version No. 1 of his fate which begins at a base camp set up at Londons Heathrow Airport Cage is forced into active duty by an unscrupulous commander (Brendan Gleeson) in charge of an imminent invasion of France where the aliens are laying waste.The critters are called Mimics which suggests a rogue squadron made up of Rich Little Frank Gorshin Catherine OHara and Michael Winslow the sound effects guy from ""Police Academy."" But they are even more fearsome than that -- superfast squid-like killers subterranean until its dyin time. Get splashed by the blood of a select breed of Mimic as Cage is in his first scarifying battle and even if you ""die"" youre not ""dead"" youre simply back at the start of the day.At first Cage cannot figure out how to maneuver in his souped-up mecha battle armor the sort of thing Ripley used in ""Aliens."" After a few deaths he gets the hang of it. Bill Paxton is swell as the Old Testament-fueled Kentucky-bred leader of J Squad an island of misfits joined by Cage. Busted down to private our reluctant hero must learn to strategize anticipate learn from his mistakes and cope with the hopped-up maniacal adversary. The only one who believes his born-again story is the fearsome Special Forces warrior played by Blunt introduced by way of her triceps. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" could in fact be called ""Here Are My Triceps.""As in ""Groundhog Day"" part of the kick of Limans film comes from watching someone try try again until success is achieved. At one point Cage attempts a dangerous roll-under maneuver involving a speeding truck; he is killed (off-camera because honestly who needs to see the results if its a joke?); rebooted he tries it again with slightly different timing and survives. Its like Bill Murrays encounters with Stephen Tobolowskys insurance man on Groundhog Day but with aliens.The supporting characters in the script by Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth arent particularly distinctive and Limans preferred action mode -- jiggly hand-held very close to actors with a lot of green-screen effects behind them -- has a way of muddying the action rather than heightening it. Like it or not its at least a conscious style; the violence is considerable but artfully steered this side of sadism. The best of the showpiece sequences is a futuristic parachute jump very poorly handled by Cage the first time pulled off with increasing accuracy and skill in the replays.The climax involves Paris in flames and up to its landmarks in water and a certain museum featured in ""The Da Vinci Code."" If only the Mimics couldve squared off against the Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon Halfway through one of those interminable explanations about the Mona Lisa -- pffffft game over.mjphillipstribune.com""Edge of Tomorrow"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence language and brief suggestive material)Running time 153Opens Thursday evening MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesBlunt joins Cruise in All You Need is Kill Warner Bros...April 16 2012Tom Cruise to Visit Three Countries In One Day for Edge of...May 7 2014Warner Bros.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Edge Of Tomorrow Doug Limans click-clacky sci-fi take on Groundhog Day stars Tom Cruise as a smarmy press flack who get stuck in a time loop during an alien invasion. An entertaining effects-driven black comedy with shades of Starship Troopers in its depiction of warfare as a futuristic turkey shoot the movie is distinguished more by how fluidly it handles its high-concept premise than where it takes it.Tasked with selling America on a European land war with the fish-mawed tentacled Mimics Cruises ex-ad-man ships off to London misbehaves and gets punished with an assignment to the front lines of a disastrous beachhead assault. Regardless of intention sci-fi movies tend to fetishize military tech which makes Edge Of Tomorrows Jackets--ugly cumbersome mechanized suits worn by the ground forces of its near future--feel refreshing. Their unintuitive controls and shoddy batteries (made to resemble Claymore mines complete with ""Front Toward Enemy"" lettering) become a running gag. The attack dubbed Operation Downfall is woefully underplanned; ammo is scarce and the Osprey-style transports end up killing more troops than they land. The resulting battlefield is a surface of rough textures lumbering machines and brutalist geometric lines broken up only by the movement of the Mimics whose herky-jerky darting resembles sped-up stop-motion.Barely able to figure out how to turn off the safety on his Jacket the hapless hero gets killed and then wakes up back at the forward operating base where he started. Once again he gets assigned to misfit J Squad led by Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton who gets to repeat some of the movies best lines); again they put on Jackets land on the beaches of northern France and are massacred by the Mimics; again he wakes up 24 hours earlier and repeats the cycle. It goes on and on restarting every time he dies. (Edge Of Tomorrow mines this mechanic for dark humor including a montage of Cruise getting shot in the head over and over.) In the process he hones skills learns humility and gains an appreciation for the nobodies whose ""necessary sacrifice"" he had once sold to the American public. He also develops feelings for Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) a hard-ass war hero who was once caught in a similar loop but he cant act on them because every time they meet its for the first time.  The role is tailor-made for Cruise whose reflexes and facial expressions have always suggested rigorous practice as though he had conditioned himself to look good doing anything from any angle. Even the characters name William Cage sounds artificial--just like Roy Miller Jack Harper Ethan Hunt or Tom Cruise. In the early scenes Cages insincerity is communicated by Cruises perfect talk-show smile. Later on his assertive athletic body language creates the sense that Cage has already been through a scene several times before even if the audience hasnt seen it. (To ensure a consistent momentum Edge Of Tomorrow begins skipping repetitions later on.) Edge Of Tomorrows main attraction is this near-seamless blend of star structure and setup. Its deft pacing canny design and sense of humor make it easy to overlook the fact that it mostly glosses over the implications of its time-loop premise. Consistency is a rare virtue for a big-budget tentpole movie; remarkably the movies ending (which diverges from Hiroshi Sakurazakas source novel All You Need Is Kill) manages to preserve a sense of integrity while delivering the requisite audience satisfaction.

If not this spoiler The faux trailer nails it like a carpenter. Surely that was the pitch to the studio; the tag line alone -- ""Live. Die. Repeat."" -- guarantees 30 million at least on opening day. It will deserve every penny.The storys simple and silly yet one more alien-invasion tale that pits humans against their would-be conquerors (who in this case look like the tentacled creepies from the Matrix trilogy). Yet again Tom Cruise is center stage during this war of the worlds this time as a PR man turned U.S. Army major tasked with selling the war till hes quickly stripped of his rank and tossed onto the front lines like fresh meat.And yes he dies ... over and over and over times a thousand for reasons we need not get into here.Hes not alone in his time-loop travel Emily Blunt a rather unlikely supersoldier but a Looper from way back knows what ails Cruises Maj. Cage and helps him unlock his inner war machine while they march slowly toward their final confrontation with the boss villain awaiting them at the end of this very slick video game.Also along for the ride Fort Worths own Bill Paxton as a master sergeant which puts him slightly higher on the food chain than when he battled those Aliens.This is the summer movie that should have been titled A Million Ways to Die; its certainly far funnier than Seth MacFarlanes DOA Western a pastiche lacking the flair warmth and generosity on display in Edge of Tomorrow. Yes -- funnier and on purpose down to Cruises ageless grin that gets wider the longer the movie plays.So youve seen this move a million times.

That year the Navy credited Top Gun for boosting enlistment by another 20000 recruits. Since then Cruise has made more critiques of military than advertisements most of which (Lions for Lambs Born on the Fourth of July The Last Samurai Valkyrie) accuse bad leadership of wasting the lives of a few -- or a million -- good men. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Edge of Tomorrow is the rare summer shoot-em-up that understands the fragility of life.With Edge of Tomorrow Cruise comes full circle. He plays Lieutenant Colonel Bill Cage a medaled propagandist who goes knock-kneed at the sight of a paper cut. In peacetime he was an ad man who had dabbled in ROTC. Now that Earth is under siege from the Mimics whirling space monsters that look like dreadlocked wigs dipped in steel hes been drafted to serve as a slick talking head who goes on Fox News to urge the poor and dumb dregs to sign up and be slap-chopped to shreds. As he cops to his commanding officer (Brendan Gleeson) ""I do this to avoid doing that.""Film Details Edge of Tomorrow RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time113 min. More Info Trailer Cage has zero intention of joining the fight. But Gleesons exasperated general conks him out and ships him to the front where Cage wakes up on a pile of luggage and discovers hes been demoted to private and will be off to battle the next day. If youre expecting a hero -- which you are as this is Tom Cruise -- youve met the wrong guy. Cage dies immediately. But then he snaps awake back on those bags and realizes hes going to relive and re-die the last 24 hours until he either wins the war or goes utterly mad from the Promethean torture.Directed by Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity) Edge of Tomorrow is a classic war movie crossbred with a Looney Tune. As in last centurys world wars the enemy is embedded in Europe and spreading across the globe with humanitys hopes pinned on reclaiming the coast of France a fight that Liman stages with the chaotic carnage of Saving Private Ryan. However instead of olive drabs the soldiers are decked out in 80-pound exoskeletons that force them to walk with the heavy high-stepping lurch of drunks in raver boots. Its a novel mash-up a gray-toned serious war picture with all these overdressed goofballs stomping around. Underneath his metal chaps one soldier cheekily refuses to wear pants.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm To work Edge of Tomorrow must both make light of death lest the audience be ground into despair and rally us to care whether Cage lives. Liman walks this tricky tightrope We chuckle when fellow soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt whose biceps look bigger than Cruises) shoots Cage like a fallen racehorse so the day can restart but every time he jolts back to life we feel for his gulping startled agony. The Wile E. Coyote fatalities are fun but its that repetitive moment of horror that holds this bipolar stunt together Cruise bug-eyed and gasping for breath as he shakes off his fear and grimly prepares for the next suicide mission.The middle of the film is an exhausting montage of murder the bracing opposite of all those movies whose heroes race through bullets as if they were as harmless as raindrops. The script works better when it slows down and the screenwriters (Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth) toy with our definition of suspense. As Cruise and Blunt make a daring dash for help our hearts race. Will they outrun the Mimics find a working helicopter dodge that plummeting plane? Slowly it sneaks up on us that Cage himself isnt scared Hes lived and died through this before and is just working through every doomed option like a kid dutifully reading each page of a Choose Your Own Adventure book. Practice has made him perfect at least up to a point allowing Liman to rework the bedlam of the opening battle until it resembles a beautiful deadly dance.Cruise hasnt physically aged out of action roles (whether hes matured out is another question). At 51 the new bags under his eyes make his characters boyish hucksterism seem even more desperate. Despite the gizmo suit were always aware that hes a man not a machine.Edge of Tomorrow carries itself like a groundbreaking blockbuster but at its core its simply asking the same question that Spock raised in Star Trek II The Wrath of Khan Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few? While Cage has the ability to save the individuals in his platoon from their fate is it moral to let them die if it means he can end the war? With godlike pressures like these its no wonder he looks like he hasnt slept.Edge of Tomorrow is the rare summer shoot-em-up that understands the fragility of life. More hopeless than heroic its not going to boost military enlistment rates. But Cruises perpetual sacrifice makes us want to salute this soldier who bravely and often blindly flings his body in harms way -- and especially those troops in our own universe who know real life doesnt have a reboot.EDGE OF TOMORROW | Directed by Doug Liman | Written by Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth | Warner Bros. | Citywide1 Edge of TomorrowPHOTO COURTESY OF WARNER BROS.

Doug Limans sharp new sci-fi fantasy places the eternally youthful star in a repeating loop to save the earth from aliens The movie begins with world news services -- the BBC Sky News -- reporting the invasion and near conquest of Europe by extraterrestrial entities. Even CNN interrupts its 24/7 coverage of that Malaysian plane giving Wolf Blitzer a chance to report an actual breaking story. And at the end (no spoiler alert necessary) we learn that ""Russian and Chinese troops are moving across Western Europe without resistance."" Thats supposed to be the good news. So were in the movies favorite nightmare fantasyland Armageddon -- or through most of Edge of Tomorrow a replay of the D-Day invasion but with Allied forces deploying from London to fight not the Nazis but the Mimics. Described as ""a spectacularly evolved world-conquering organism"" and looking like jellyfish or octopuses with limbs resembling Rastafarian locks these alien beings take on the properties of the creatures they have encountered and assimilated. With tremendous speed and agility they pop out of nowhere and zap youre dead -- you and virtually all the other soldiers you hit the beach with. The Mimics can achieve this because theyve been through this battle many times before and ""an enemy that knows the future cant lose."" (READ When Tom Cruise went nuts on Oprah) The only way to survive and perhaps save the mission is to catch a dose of the Mimics strength. You die on the battlefield and then are instantly reborn back at the Heathrow training base where you sharpen your warrior skills while memorizing every detail of the Mimics movements. Landing for the second or hundredth time on the beach at the exact same future time you relive your fatal nightmare but with crucial tweaks now you can anticipate the enemys feints and score some kills. Guiding you is a luscious superefficient soldier Rita Vrataski -- the Angel of Verdun or the Full Metal Bitch -- though each time you meet her she doesnt know who you are. Tom Cruise is the Groundhog Day grunt and Emily Blunt the Angel Bitch in Edge of Tomorrow a furiously time-looping joy ride and the smartest action film of the early summer season. The movies only static element is its title which oddly suggests a mashup of TV soap operas. Director Doug Liman and screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth could have borrowed a name from any number of James Bond films -- You Only Live Twice Live and Let Die Tomorrow Never Dies Die Another Day -- to describe its heros curse and gift. Or they could have kept the title of Hiroshi Sakurazakas 2004 source novel All You Need Is Kill. (It sounds exactly as cool in the original Japanese Oru Yu Nido Izu Kiru.) In Steven Spielbergs 2005 War of the Worlds remake Cruise was an ordinary dad trying to outrun an alien takeover. In last years Oblivion he was a career soldier battling his own clone. As Major William Cage in Edge of Tomorrow he is at first the anti-Tom. A former ad agency spin doctor Cage joined the service to create promos that would entice civilians into deadly combat. Hes the Don Draper of World War III. ""I do this to avoid doing that"" he tells the hardass General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson). ""Cant stand the sight of blood. Not so much as a paper cut."" Unlike the gung-ho Maverick in Top Gun which launched Cruise to stardom 28 years ago Cage is spoiling not to fight. (READ Tom Cruise fights Tom Cruise in Oblivion) Brigham stockades the reluctant warrior and attaches him to a squad of soldiers due to be dropped on the beach tomorrow. And now hes a private with a cowards rep to be bullied by his master sergeant (Bill Paxton) and his gruff new mates. (Cruise looks great at 51 -- he could be a fit 40. Still wouldnt his fellow soldiers wonder why a guy approaching middle age has the armys lowest rank? Answer No because its a movie) With precious little training in weapons operation and maneuvering his bulky robot uniform Cage lands on the beach and sees his squad promptly wiped out. In one weirdly funny image a cargo plane drops to the earth smashing one soldier. This is the Saving Private Ryan beach invasion played a second time as tragic farce. Yet on Spielbergs Omaha Beach there was no fabulous babe no female Audie Murphy for an out-of-place out-of-time soldier to bond with. Rita used to be ""in the loop"" with the Mimics but not now ""I had it and I lost it."" But when she realizes that Cage has somehow got on the enemys wavelength -- a fact she must face anew each time she sees him since hes come back from the future -- she trains him at Heathrow and fights bravely with him. As the periods of their endlessly repeated first meeting lengthen they escape the beach for a deserted farmhouse; then the Thames River infested with swimming Mimics; and finally Paris in search of the Omega Mimic that directs all the others. (READ Richard Schickel on Saving Private Ryan) For most of the films two hours Liman keeps the plot plates spinning with the suave dexterity he showed in Swingers Go The Bourne Identity and Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith. (Liman had a down phase with Jumper and Fair Game but all his pictures have addressed the lies that are taken as truth and the mystery of even a heros personality.) Photographed by Dion Beebe in the desaturated khaki colors of Saving Private Ryan and World War Z the movie figures its viewers are bright enough to grab the premise and parlays that belief into audience exhilaration. Each succeeding visit to Heathrow or the beach is shorter sometimes only by a second; the rhythm accelerates vertiginously the tension tautens. Only toward the climax when the live-die-repeat cycle is abandoned does Edge of Tomorrow go logy. But its two-thirds of a sensational ride -- one you can ride over and over without buying additional tickets. Revealing the timidity of the X-Men Days of Future Past premise -- one man going back in time to connect with a younger version of an old friend -- Edge of Tomorrow is also a metaphor for moviemaking the film is all about rehearsal about living and learning (or dying and learning) and gradually turning mistakes into triumphs. Cage has not only read the ""script"" of the Mimics war but has infused it into his central nervous system. In that sense its a demonstration of the 10000-hours-of-practice theory popularized by Malcolm Gladwell in Outliers. Keep doing something forever and maybe youll get it right. (READ Lev Grossman on Malcolm Gladwells Outliers) In a complicated scenario with just four prominent roles (Cruise Blunt Paxton and Gleeson) the two leading players must radiate star quality and sex appeal. Solemn and toned to the max Blunt proves a strong partner for an actor who can still earn the sobriquet Tom Terrific. More often than most Hollywood hunks Cruise steps outside his comfort zone to embrace weird characters -- in Magnolia Lions for Lambs Tropic Thunder and Rock of Ages. But its also cool to see him bend the familiar action-fantasy format and as he does here stick the landing. An aging star cant push envelopes forever. According to the Internet Movie Database Cruise is becoming his own Cage planning to star in the sequels Mission Impossible 5 Top Gun 2 and Jack Reacher Never Go Back. Twist that last title and you have a suitable name for his current very savory film Always Go Back. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Specifically what if you had to go through the brutal grind of dying over and over and over again in order to reach your final objective learning just a little bit more each time before starting again at the beginning? Thats the fate of Major William Cage (an expertly used Tom Cruise) a reluctant-soldier who gets caught up in an alien invaders time loop. Writer Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) handles the concept with aplomb and hes smart enough to know that the real interest here is what effect this kind of life would have on human relationships. But while he raises the question he never quite manages an answer. Having gone meta at the outset the film seems content to slide into First Person Shooter mode for the big finish.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 737 p.m. EDT June 4 2014Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise star in ""Edge of Tomorrow.""(Photo David James Warner Bros. Pictures)Ordinarily Tom Cruise is the biggest star in any blockbuster in which he has a part. But he chivalrously lets Emily Blunt be his action-hero equal in Edge of Tomorrow. And the mind-bending thriller (1/2 out of four rated PG-13; opens Thursday night in some theaters and Friday nationwide) is better for it.The sci-fi premise employs a day-repeating time-loop strategy made famous in 1993s Groundhog Day but put to much grimmer use in this story of an alien invasion.What emerges is an inventive mash-up with elements of that film plus Inception War of the Worlds and Independence Day.In a rare instance the movies tagline actually is a perfect summation ""Live. Die. Repeat.""The story takes place in a seemingly near-future in which aliens battle to take over the world having already annihilated a large swath of the human race.Legions of soldiers try to fight them off to little avail. A key battle brings to mind the Normandy invasion which is well-timed given that the movie opens on June 6 the 70th anniversary of D-Day.The aliens dubbed ""mimics slither speedily on a bevy of legs like scuttling spiders but theyre disappointingly interchangeable .Cruise starts out as anything but a hero. Hes a military man but just barely. As slick media relations officer Major William Cage hes a talking head on the nightly news spinning the courageous exploits of real soldiers.Bravery is not his thing. He only took the spokesman gig when he lost his advertising agency.So when British Gen. Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) orders Cage to report to the Atlantic front his knee-jerk response is cowardice and self-serving manipulation. Insisting hes not a soldier just a guy who plays one on TV Cage tries to blackmail the commanding officer. Its never a good idea to threaten a four-star general.The next thing Cage knows hes arrested. From there hes thrown into the ranks of combat soldiers and sent off on a mission against relentless foes. Not surprisingly he doesnt survive. But then he wakes up in the same place he was in before going to battle and a time loop kicks in. Cage lives out the same day repeatedly panicking fighting and dying -- living a bit longer each time.On one of these recurring days he meets Special Forces Sgt. Rita Vrataski (Blunt) a legendary combatant dubbed ""the Angel of Verdun."" She trains Cage to be a soldier and they join forces.While the time-loop concept is ingenious the repetition grows tedious and resembles a video game but with murky rules.Cruise and Blunt have a measure of chemistry however their characters go undeveloped given short shrift amid the spectacle.But the pulse-pounding action scenes are briskly directed by Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity Mr. and Mrs. Smith). A trio of writers are credited with the script including Oscar-winning screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects).Edge of Tomorrows unrelenting spin cycle is leavened with humor making for a million ways to die in Western Europe. 43 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1haUOoP",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/06/04/edge-of-tomorrow-review/9630483/,200,edgeoftomorrow39,edgeoftomorrow,usatoday

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr READY SET ACTION We were actually on the edge of our seats (David James) B+ Edge of Tomorrow Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy Action/Adventure; Starring Emily Blunt Tom Cruise; Director Doug Liman; Release Date Wide 06/06/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 116; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted June 19 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Despite its terribly unimaginative title Edge of Tomorrow is a surprisingly imaginative summer action movie. I have to admit I had my doubts going in. After all its been only a little over a year since Tom Cruises last razzle-dazzle sci-fi spectacle Oblivion. And we all know how that one turned out. But give Cruise credit Not only is he hard-headed enough to get right back on the horse that bucked him but he manages to show us why he still matters as a movie star -- one of the last in a dinosaur species that once lorded over the multiplex like a colossus. Whether you loved or merely tolerated his past few efforts as a leading man hes never given less than everything he has. He still cares at a time when caring is dismissed as outdated and square. Cruise plays Maj. William Cage a military PR officer whose only knowledge of combat is the kind hes had with reporters in the spin room. Hes a smooth-talking coward with a smug grin. As the film opens were barraged with a series of TV news bulletins giving us the latest on an apocalyptic invasion of Earth by a slithery race of calamari-looking aliens called Mimics. Cage appears on air to reassure humanity that these new foes can be beaten pointing to the heroics of Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) a fearless soldier anointed with the nickname ""Angel of Verdun."" But when a general (Brendan Gleeson) wants to embed Cage on the front lines he unsuccessfully tries to chicken out and gets Tased by an MP. The screen fades to black. When he comes to hes being barked at by a Southern-fried sergeant (Bill Paxton) who strong-arms him into joining a suicide mission. He bites it on the battlefield almost immediately. The screen fades to black again. And Cage wakes up back at the beginning. Whats going on here? Like Groundhog Day or Source Code Doug Limans Edge of Tomorrow is one of those time-loop thrillers where a reluctant hero has to relive the same events over and over videogame-style learning a little more each time until he can get it all right (see sidebar). Its not the most original setup to be sure but what makes this particular celluloid Mobius strip bend in on itself with such seamlessness is the cheeky airtight logic of Christopher McQuarrie Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworths script -- and the stars. While Cruise sells the deja vu contraption with his usual single-minded determination its Blunt who emerges as the who-knew wild card. We tend to think that stars of Cruises magnitude are either unwilling or constitutionally unable to let their female costars share the glow. But Blunt is given the chance to shine as the bare-knuckle badass Rita. And she takes to the role like the second coming of Ripley. She may need Cruises time-bending gifts but he needs her guts and smarts more. In a way Edge of Tomorrow ends up being a deliciously subversive kind of blockbuster. Its being sold to the public as a Tom Cruise movie. But deep down its the most feminist summer action flick in years.

Photo AP/Warner Bros. Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Edge of Tomorrow Running time 113 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sanitized violence). At the Lincoln Square the Union Square others. A Tom Cruise action flick with a strong female heroine and a sense of humor? ""Edge of Tomorrow has both of those plus a ""Groundhog Day-style gimmick that pays big dividends. Over and over. Its exciting and a lot of fun -- especially if youre willing to check your brain at the popcorn stand -- and is smart filmmaking by the very modest standards of summer blockbusters. Welcome to the not-too-distant future when Europe and Asia have been conquered by deadly extraterrestrial soldiers. But the tide has been turning and humans are planning a huge invasion on the same Normandy beaches where D-Day occurred. The allied commander (Brendan Gleeson) in London inexplicably wants the militarys top spin doctor Cage (Cruise) to embed with the troops landing from the air -- never mind that hes never been trained for combat. Tom Cruise heads into battle ... again and again in ""Edge of Tomorrow.""Photo AP/Warner Bros. Pictures The cowardly Cage not only balks but (oddly) threatens Gleeson with bad p.r. if hes sent. So Gleeson has Cage arrested busted from colonel to private and shipped out the next morning as a grunt with gung-ho commander Bill Paxton s first wave of invaders in sophisticated metal battle suits equipped with built-in guns and rocket launchers. None of this makes much sense but director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Supremacy) doesnt give you much time to think about it. Moments after landing Cages is killed by one of the aliens during the invasion. Then Cage wakes up to relive the same day thanks to a not particularly well-explained mechanism that allows him to ""reset every time hes killed. And this happens a lot. Every time he repeats the day he becomes a better soldier and is eventually able to even help his comrades in arms. Of course nobody believes Cage when he explains how hes acquired his improved combat skills -- since none of them remembers how he screwed up previously. The exception is the ever-delightful Emily Blunt as Rita a decorated war heroine who had the same ability as Cage to reset when killed -- at least until she lost it because of a blood transfusion. She explains to Cage that one of the reasons the extraterrestrials are such formidable opponents is that they too can reset -- and that Cages ability can provide a window into their strategy that may turn the tide for humankind. Still with me? None of this is going to matter much except to geeks. Everyone else is going to enjoy the action set-pieces the most elaborate video game-like battles since ""Starship Troopers. The acting in this handsome production is better than usual for the genre though the actors arent able to suggest the intense level of dread and peril of the films obvious model ""Aliens. The generic-looking tentacled aliens just arent that scary. Blunt makes a convincing warrior though Rita isnt as well-written a person as Blunts character in her last foray into time-travel sci-fi the superior ""Looper. The actress even survives a half-hearted attempt at suggesting Rita is romantically attracted to Cage -- Cruise remains unable to suggest hes capable of loving anyone but himself. British beauty Emily Blunt joins Tom Cruise in ""Edge of Tomorrow.""Photo AP/Warner Bros. Pictures One of the best standing jokes in ""Edge of Tomorrow is the characters selfishness -- and that unfortunately extends to the actors lack of generosity at the climax which seems to be heading toward something entirely new for a Tom Cruise movie. Instead the movie ends with a truly WTF moment. But even that doesnt really spoil the fun.

(Jaap Buitendijk) Emily Blunt girds for combat in Edge of Tomorrow. (David James) Cruise battles aliens trying to destroy civilization in Edge of Tomorrow. (David James) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday June 4 2014 1041 AM Title Edge of Tomorrow Film Info A reluctant soldier is stuck in a ""Groundhog Day"" loop fighting aliens every day. Director Doug Liman (153). PG-13 Violence language. Area theaters. You know what? None of us will ever marry Tom Cruise or couch jump with him or discuss our competing spiritual philosophies. Really all he needs to do is entertain us. And as the sharp suspenseful ""Edge of Tomorrow"" reminds us there are still very few superstars who do it better. Cruise seems almost pathologically devoted to giving us a good time which means he usually aims high in terms of material and collaborators. Hes got a dream team here led by director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"" ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"") adapting Hiroshi Sakurazakas Japanese novel ""All You Need Is Kill."" When we first meet Cruises arrogant Major Cage sometime in the near future hes handling media for the Army so he wont have to fight. But Earth has recently been invaded by some very nasty aliens and General Brigham (Brendan Gleeson) wants him on the front lines. Unconcerned by Cages complete lack of training Master Sgt. Farell (Bill Paxton) drops him straight into battle. Hes dead within minutes. But then ... hes not. A chance encounter with a rare alien gives him the ability to live the same day over and over. When he shares this secret with Special Ops Sgt. Vrataski (Emily Blunt) she sees humanitys only hope. So back he goes to fight the same fights again and again until the humans can anticipate every move the aliens will make. Emily Blunt plays a commander in Edge of Tomorrow. (Warner Bros. Entertainment) Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow. (David James) Emily Blunt as Special Ops Sgt. Vrataski (David James) Tom Cruise in Edge of Tomorrow (David James) Theres an apt irony in the movies own recycled visions which deftly invoke countless seemingly unrelated films like ""Groundhog Day"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" ""Source Code"" and Cruises own canon (""Top Gun"" ""A Few Good Men"" ""War of the Worlds""). Liman and his screenwriters -- Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects"") and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth (""Fair Game"") -- make their concept feel fresh with smart setups and ambitious (if underdeveloped) themes. Its impossible to watch Cage perpetually steeling himself to face old horrors and new surprises without thinking of every soldiers eternal burden. Crucially Cruise knows just how to pace Cages shift from cowardly to courageous. Yes we get cool effects and impressive machinery. But he and Liman add unexpected humor and genuine tension to the seasonal thrill of blowing stuff up. Thats no small feat in a genre generally built on empty spectacle. Meanwhile we havent even gotten to Blunts role as Cages commander a heroine so unquestioningly in control that she feels almost revolutionary. Most action stars would keep all the glory for themselves. But Cruise knew their partnership would make for a better movie so he embraced it. Granted were not talking Oscars here. The time-loop logic doesnt stand up to scrutiny the supporting characters are cartoonishly two-dimensional and the aliens should have been more interesting. But despite all that -- and thanks in great part to leads who couldnt be more committed -- ""Edge of Tomorrow"" has everything you could ask for in a summer blockbuster. And heres the proof As soon as its done youll want to go back and relive it all over again. ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

"Review Edge of Tomorrow a smart fun sci-fi thrill ride - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Edge of Tomorrow a smart fun sci-fi thrill rideBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 06/03/2014 051403 PM PDTUpdated 06/04/2014 045443 PM PDT Tom Cruises new fantastically fun sci-fi thriller ""Edge of Tomorrow"" comes out Friday. And I hate to play spoiler but Cruises character dies. Aliens kill him -- many many times. Same for Emily Blunts character. They die like 300 times -- though I may have to check my notes on that. The good news is they keep coming back because Earth needs saving and no one else (including most of the audience) can understand what these aliens are up to. They are a collection of hyper-nasty swirling spider-thingies possessing awe-inspiring intelligence serious anger and control issues and a vast propensity for violence (theyre sneaky too). And they know about do-overs. Emily Blunt as Rita and Tom Cruise as Cage in Edge of Tomorrow. (David James/ Warner Bros.) So ""Tomorrow"" is like Bill Murray bringing his characters dilemma in ""Groundhog Day"" to Sigourney Weaver on the set of ""Alien"" (without anyone knowing their streams would cross in ""Ghostbusters""). And while Cruises character keeps coming back to life in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" the actor also may be pulling off a career resurrection possibly quieting naysayers who contend that he can no longer carry a summer blockbuster.At first glance ""Edge of Tomorrow"" looks like just another ambitious ""message"" sci-fi flick propped up by a well-worn story line about a dystopian Earth such as Cruises ""Oblivion"" or Will Smiths ""After Earth."" Thankfully the concept here seemingly has been adjusted to allow for some serious action sequences unexpected spots of humor and a story that doesnt come anywhere near insulting the audiences intelligence. In fact the script takes some refreshingly clever turns.Cruise plays Maj. William Cage a handsome charming and somewhat slimy military talking head who has far more experience discussing war on CNN than he does on a real battlefield. Cage gets unexpectedly dumped into a front-line infantry unit right before a futuristic D-Day (right -- the bad guys occupy most of Europe except for Britain which the good guys still hold and use to launch a massive beach assault on France). Unexpected hilarity ensues as Cruise has no idea how to even take the safety off his weapon let alone fight. Bill Paxton is laughingly perfect as Cruises unit commander Master Sgt. Fare who toggles between Paxtons overbearing bully from ""Weird Science"" and his bug-eyed bewildered character in ""Aliens."" Blunt plays war hero Rita Vrataski whose exploits are the fabric of military recruiting campaigns. She also has something in common with Cage that allows them to understand things others dont -- namely that Cage as a result of a battlefield incident starts his day over every time he dies. That means if something goes wrong Vrataski can simply shoot Cage and start over. During one scene Cage wants to try a new approach to which Vrataski says shell give him 10 minutes ""Then Im killing you."" ""Fine"" Cage says. Tom Cruise as Cage in Edge of Tomorrow. (Warner Bros.) Like Murrays protagonist in ""Groundhog Day"" Cage uses the extended time to become a better man while advancing his skills -- in this case becoming a crack soldier while trying to figure out how to save Earth. Unlike Murrays Cages day doesnt reboot unless he dies which presents some unique negotiations between Cage and Vrataski (Cruise and Blunt have undeniable chemistry) as their personal campaigns progress. Director Doug Liman doesnt let the plot stagnate or become overly complicated which could easily have happened if not for his focus on action and his occasional gallows humor as well as the natural shine of his two leads. Cruise is back in his irresistibly likable comfort zone while Blunt is surprisingly potent as a determined soldier who allows Cage to see just enough of her vulnerability. Best of all Liman eschews the not-so-subtle ""were-killing-our-planet"" message of similar films to let his movie progress without preaching. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" manages to keep us interested while not insulting our intelligence.There are a few questions that never get satisfactory answers such as why Cage went from being the militarys star talking head to an infantryman overnight. And even though the relatively simple plot points keep the story moving a bit more background about the aliens would have helped present a more complete picture.Then again there is a lot going on here and no obvious need to muddy things up by digging too deep into the aliens motivations. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" while smart and fun doesnt need to do more than let us slug it out with them and add a clever twist here and there to keep things interesting. Mission accomplished.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.Edge of Tomorrow    Rating PG-13 (intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence language brief suggestive material) Cast Tom Cruise Emily Blunt Bill Paxton Brendan Gleeson Jonas ArmstrongDirector Doug LimanRunning time 1 hour 53 minutes Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is an officer and a PR man given an order to land and record footage with the assault forces in the big push thats designed to stop the enemy. When he refuses hes slapped in chains and busted to Private. Given minimal training and a exo-skeleton loaded with weapons and technology he goes into battle on the shore of Normandy the next day and dies fast and ugly his blood mingling with whatever it is that floods out of one of the alien officers... And then wakes up alive whole and entire on the morning of the day before his fateful futile drop into France where he dies... A mix of forward-looking sci-fi classic themes deft plotting and superb writing and direction ""Edge of Tomorrow"" may be the pure-pleasure blockbuster to beat this Summer. Its easy to dismiss the film as a pastiche of its influences -- ""Starship Loopers Save Private Ryan on the Longest Groundhog Day"" -- but accurate as that joke it it nonetheless does the film no justice. Director Doug Liman and his team of screenwriters Chris McQuarrie and the pair of John-Henry and Jez Butterworth arent just re-cycling old plots and tropes but rather up-cycling them making them shiny and new and fun in a way that not only works as entertainment but also works superbly with star Tom Cruises abilities and image to groovy goofy effect. (Based on the novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka ""Edge of Tomorrow"" displays McQuarries fingerprints as a writer -- smart cynical snappy -- most clearly.) From his first death -- big eyes staring out of a blown-up face -- Cruise and the movie both work and work hard to turn his journey through cosmic oddness and ammo-spitting action into a sci-fi variation on Wile E. Coyote Effort failure agony re-start. Tom Cruise is like all movie stars a little under-served by that mere appellation -- hes actually an interesting actor God forbid and one whose secret weapon is his public face. Cruise always looks like hes on top of things but hes at his best when hes trying to look like hes on top of things when he is not. Cruise puts the con in confidence in many of his roles -- and Maj. Cage who goes from the last guy youd want fighting in the war to being the only man who can win it is a perfect fit for him. Watching the Tom Cruise get punched off Tom Cruises face in this film -- often and often fatally -- is one of its major pleasures. We love watching Cruise play the man wholl never say die. What happens when die is all he can do? Eventually Cage manages to manipulate his moebius-strip timeline until he meets propaganda poster girl and decorated soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) who tore through the invaders at Verdun -- specifically because she like he was looping through time in a similar way or that battle -- and now cant. The aliens control time -- and use that control to ensure crushing absolute victory -- and Cage returning to life again and again with more information earned each time he dies will be the key. Its one thing to find a summer blockbuster that at first glance is as well-shot and well-made as this one with smart creative decisions directing the craft. (Director of Photography Dion Beebe deserves much well-earned credit here.) But ""Edge of Tomorrow"" zips by so fast its like seeing a Ferrari whip by before you get a chance to look under the hood to see exactly what makes it so speedy. The montages here arent shortcuts in the storytelling -- they are the storytelling showing us Cages journey through a short life and resurrection as he follows the tracks or leaps them every time. The aliens cracked-out on time itself move almost too quickly to be seen -- which makes them easier SFX creations and means we feel more of an impact when we can see them. The power-suits Cage and Vrtaski wear are badass -- but never obscure their faces and its made clear that as ever its whos carrying the gear that makes it count. The supporting cast is all excellent -- Blunt is a warrior-woman who knows more than she lets on; Bill Paxton plays the older grizzled order-spitting Master Sgt. Farell; a host of great actors with great faces like Noah Taylor and Kick Gurry make up the rest of the phony-tough and crazy-brave in Cages doomed battalion. Blunt gets to be both tough and tender but not too much of the latter -- a constantly-resetting timeline means no time for love Dr. Jones -- and its the kind of performance on her part that has surface-level gloss but that will also yield deeper pleasures on repeated viewings. Director Liman jumped to action-studio films with 2002s ""The Bourne Identity"" -- another action film like this one about self-preservation as self-discovery -- and hes definitely deftly improved his game in the intervening years. Id much rather watch Limans shooting and staging (and the wit he brings to them) than anything similar-ish from ham-handed masters of the mediocre like Michael Bay or Matthew Vaughn. And the best thing about ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is that its fun -- no watching huge monsters destroy cities as we look on helpless; no mopey mutants whining about persecution; just one person aided by and aiding others facing fearful odds with the world at stake. Itd be easy to dismiss ""Edge of Tomorrow"" as just another blunt-force summer movie but its sharp as a scalpel in the deft hands of its makers with the kind of smarts wit filmmaking and force too many other summer films can only dream of.

At 51 (but looking like a boy of 35) Cruise is battling a spidery race of aliens called Mimics in Doug Limans action sci-fi blockbuster. The films Groundhog Day-meets-Independence Day plot is actually pretty genius. Cruise is Bill Cage the armys top PR guy - a total coward with a salesmans smile. After pissing off the wrong general Cage finds himself demoted and on the frontline where hes killed in two minutes flat. But (and here is where it gets Groundhoggy) he wakes up in a loop forced to fight the same battle over and over again. Each day it takes a little bit longer to die and Cage teams up with the armys badass-iest fighter Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) aka Full Metal Bitch. Doug Liman directed The Bourne Identity and goes for gun-metal realism here too possibly at the expense of the special effects which arent much to write home about. As for Cruise hes on to a winner for approximately half the film. In coward mode it almost looks like hes taking the mick out of Tom Cruise action hero. He sweats and he squeaks looking frankly petrified. Then he starts with the search-for-the-hero-inside-yourself routine and goes on to autopilot like hes barely got a thought in his head.

Tom Cruise does a very convincing job of acting the cowardly general and I found myself laughing with delight as I witnessed him being forced to join the army over and over again.

Enjoyable sci-fi romp even if the plot does seem implausible if you think about it too deeply. It started off a little mundanely but once the time-loop factor kicked in it became far more interesting and opened up to a good mix of action sequences and light-hearted scenes. Cruise and Blunt work well though I found Cruise far more convincing as the novice warrior rather than when hes in full battle mode. CGI effects were not bad but not amazing...the images of war and apocalyptic cityscapes was well portrayed but the alien adversary was disappointingly spared any detail by its rapid movement as well as the short fast camera shots. The ending appeared disjointed and rushed for me but overall I found it very entertaining.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 28 2014 at 146 PM updated June 06 2014 at 1023 AM comments Its ""Groundhog Day"" meets ""Aliens."" That is Im sure the way ""Edge of Tomorrow"" was pitched to investors and for once its not a bad way to think of the movie. Like ""Aliens"" it has a bunch of grunts facing a lot of slithery monsters. And like ""Groundhog Day"" our hero has been caught in a time loop where has to relive the same day over and over. Hoping desperately that one day he gets that one day right. Tom Cruise is the hero (from Cranbury N.J. no less) and he does the usual heroic Tom Cruise things -- running hard riding a motorcycle and acting cocky. (He also fires off a few of his patented grins.) But he seems to realize he has a better script than he did in ""Jack Reacher"" or ""Oblivion"" and as a result he relaxes a bit; for once hes not using his charisma like a club to beat us into submission. Nor is he quite his usual dominant force. The smart story has him landing on the frontlines of this intergalactic war as an out-of-his-element PR guy; the real alpha warrior is Emily Blunt a Joan-of-Arc symbol of battlefield courage and human resistance. In Edge of Tomorrow Emily Blunt plays a soldier who becomes a symbolWARNER BROS. Cruises only advantage? Unlike her he knows whats going to happen and so how to avoid the worst of it. And that even if he does get killed hell wake up at the start of the same day with another chance to do it all over again. As a fantasy ""Groundhog Day"" never really tried to explain why Bill Murray was caught in that cycle; unfortunately ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is sci-fi and feels it sort of has to and the explanation -- its related to alien biology -- never really convinces. If you can go with it though the movie pretty much never stops going from its D-Day style attempt to retake Europe to more ""War of the Worlds"" sequences that see Cruise and Blunt taking shelter in an abandoned farm or wandering a desolate city. ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a welcome return not only for Cruise but for a few other talents. Like director Doug Liman who started with indies like ""Swingers"" and ""Go"" moved on to the clever first ""The Bourne Identity"" -- and then after the over-the-top ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" seemed to go off-track. Hes back in good form here though. The aliens are tentacled horrors the soldiers exo-skeleton suits are impressive and although there are plenty of effects shots there are enough real locations and believably beat-up machinery to keep it from feeling like a videogame. Enough real actors too including not only its stars -- who have an honest if wary connection - but solid support staff like Bill Paxton not coincidentally a veteran of ""Aliens"" who shows up here as a blood-and-guts Master Sergeant. And although assigning credit to anyone on a screenplay is a gamble Id like to think Paxtons funny speeches come courtesy of Christopher McQuarrie the Princeton-born author of ""The Usual Suspects"" who seems to be coming out of a long dry spell (""Jack Reacher"" ""The Tourist"" ""Valkyrie""). The movie makes missteps even if you take that big leap of faith in accepting the premise. Blunts heroine remains a bit of a cipher and the action sequences are uniformly edited for speed and surprise; a longer slower quieter one in which a character had to elude a stalking predator would have been a welcome change of pace. But its still a big bright loud and occasionally smart entertainment and well worth seeing once -- although not perhaps every day for the rest of your life. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Edge of Tomorrow (PG-13) Warner Bros. (113 min.) Directed by Doug Liman. With Tom Cruise Emily Blunt.

The familiarity never gets in the way of the fun however with director Doug Liman (""The Bourne Identity"" ""Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith"") and screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie (who recently directed Cruise in ""Jack Reacher"") Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth keeping the plot moving forward (albeit in a circle) with surprising injections of wit. See video Tom Cruise Spends an Eternity Dying in New Edge of Tomorrow Trailer It seems like a million years ago now but there was a time when Liman made his name with explosion-free comedies like ""Swingers"" and ""Go""; its that latter film that ""Edge of Tomorrow"" most often resembles with its out-of-order-ticking-clock structure and its pampered protagonist who quickly finds himself way in over his head. ""Tomorrow"" begins with a rapid-fire montage of news reports of an alien invasion of Europe; all seems lost until soldier Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) also known as ""the Angel of Verdun"" wipes out a bunch of E.T.s in the militarys new exo-skeleton armor/weaponry. The U.S. Armys PR officer Major Bill Cage (Tom Cruise) appears on news shows around the world to reassure the public that international fighting forces equipped with similar battle suits will have the same success as the relatively untrained Rita. Cage is happy to put a positive spin on the war from a safe distance but when the general (Brendan Gleeson) in charge of anti-alien combat wants to embed Cage with the front line of forces the officer chickens out and refuses. Cage is arrested and knocked out; when he wakes up hes been busted to private and being mobilized out of Heathrow with a barking sergeant (Bill Paxton) prepping him for the glory of battle. That ""glory"" occurs the next morning and its a catastrophe with human forces being picked off easily by the aliens. Through sheer luck Cage outlasts most of his comrades even killing a larger more threatening alien who bleeds all over Cage before killing him...at which point Cage wakes up at Heathrow again. Cage keeps trying to change the sequence of events but he keeps dying and waking up and dying and waking up over and over again. Everything seems immutable -- until he runs into Rita on the battlefield and she tells him ""Find me when you wake up."" Also read Tom Cruises Edge of Tomorrow Could Be Summers First Big-Budget Bomb Rita it turns out was also once infected by one of those larger aliens and it connected her to the alien hive-mind giving her the same cyclical immortality until a blood transfusion stripped her of those abilities. Mankinds only hope is for Rita to turn Cage into a soldier (no matter how many times she has to kill him to do it) so that the two can find the alien alpha-mind that controls the entire invading force. Like the wartime movies of the 1940s (not to mention Paul Verhoevens parody of same in ""Starship Troopers"") ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a movie where a callow selfish d-bag learns to be a better person by going to war. Weve seen Cruise on this jerk-to-gem path before although this film seems almost cannily designed to draw in ticket buyers who are fed up with the actor. ""Dont like Tom Cruise?"" the film seems to be offering ""Come watch him get killed over and over again"" Hes actually delivering a nicely underplayed performance as though he were aware that its the high-concept plot thats the real star here. Blunt commits to the material as well; she might seem wildly miscast as a war hero but given the strange circumstances by which Rita achieves her notoriety (as does Cage) it makes sense that they didnt cast a Sigourney Weaver type. See video Top Gun Sequel Will See Tom Cruise Grappling With Drone Warfare Jerry Bruckheimer Says Liman gives editor James Herbert (""Sherlock Holmes"") a lot to work with giving us different angles on repeated scenes (except when making them identical is part of the joke); for a film about repetition ""Edge of Tomorrow"" never feels tired or familiar. If theres anything disappointing about the film it involves the ending; its a defensible one but everything leading up to it fooled me into expecting something smarter or more daring. Ultimately though ""Edge of Tomorrow"" feels sharper and more clever than it might have been in other hands and for a big summer star vehicle thats surprise enough. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

A narratively ambitious sci-fi actioner Edge of Tomorrow plays out a familiar alien invasion apocalypse drama in a way that through repetition allows humanity to learn from its mistakes and have a shot at surviving until another movies monsters from outer space show up. Picking yourself up to fight another day might work for the characters but battle fatigue eventually sets in for viewers as Doug Limans film keeps folding back on itself time and time again. Tom Cruise and gigantic action scenes assure sizable openings internationally but several commercial question marks hover over this expensive Warner Bros. release including the second-tier tentpole grosses for the stars recent action outings (other than for the Mission Impossible franchise) a title that sounds like it belongs on an old daytime soap opera and most significantly the extent to which audiences will tire of the lets-play-it-over-again storyline. Based on a well-regarded 2004 novel by Hiroshi Sakurazaka the clever script by Christopher McQuarrie and Jez and John-Henry Butterworth not only plays with time and the way technology could be used to upgrade human capabilities but takes a relatively playful attitude toward the familiar battle tropes. Even the ever-image-conscious Cruise allows himself and his character to be made fun of as his U.S. Army Major William Cage a PR guy and wily spin doctor is an acknowledged wimp whos never seen combat and tries every trick to wriggle out of being sent to the front which is exactly what Gen. Brigham (Brendan Gleeson in amusingly scornful form) intends to do with him. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies From X-Men Days of Future Past to Mockingjay The general gets to spout such fresh lines as ""All of humanity is at stake"" which is the case this time because of something called ""the mimic scourge"" an invasion of ferocious metallic spidery critters with way too many tendrils that whip around like crazy and pierce you like javelins. The mimics have taken over even more European territory than the Nazis did and are on the verge of sacking the U.K. a fate the allied United Defense Force is trying to avoid with the self-explanatory D-Day 2.0. Except its not going well. Despite the considerable manpower and heavy hardware the UDF throws at the enemy the Normandy beaches are littered with human detritus. Its impossible to imagine that the addition of the cowardly Cage whos been demoted to private will alter the UDFs fortunes in any way. ""Im not a soldier"" he protests and promptly proves it by being offed within moments of chuting down into a battle that is way beyond anything Private Ryan ever faced. Created specifically to kill the mimics snap swirl dart lunge whip and assault like an octopus on speed. They can be stopped but only with great difficulty and its hard to see where they are much less judge when and from what direction they will strike. For their part the soldiers are so heavily armed and armored that they resemble half-men half-machines; theyre like robo-grunts clomping around in what look like giant ski boots and surrounded by exoskeleton machine-gun arms. VIDEO Edge of Tomorrow Trailer Like Groundhog Day With Aliens and Pain One warrior doesnt wear a helmet ostensibly because she bravely shuns them but perhaps also because she looks so much better without one. Shes Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) the Achilles of the UDF the Audie Murphy of the beach the Joan of Arc who inspires everyone else to fight harder and better. The interplay between her and the inept Cage as well as the other half-dozen members of J Squad is moderately amusing at first. He keeps getting killed but then thanks to a playing-God-type technological breakthrough he wakes up on the same morning ready to undertake the same mission again. The process repeats so often that it becomes a time loop that pushes him further and further into the battle enabling him to do a bit better each time. More crucially still Cage catches a glimpse of the Omega the elusive brain behind the mimics. Vrataski has determined that the only way to win the war is to destroy the Omega so she and Cage embark upon a rigorous training program the fruits of which will as they like to say in movies like this determine the fate of the planet. Although the humor helps the Groundhog Day-like repetition gets tedious; it makes you feel more like a hamster than a groundhog -- or rather a hamsters wheel going round and round over and over again. Unfortunately the final stretch becomes dramatically unconvincing and visually murky as the valiant duo follow the scent of the Omega to its unlikely hideout under the glass pyramid at the Louvre where a seriously underwhelming and downright odd final reckoning takes place. If the Omega is so smart cant it rewind the results too for a better outcome? The effects are exciting convincing and gritty in the chaotic Normandy battle action which is filmed in a vivid you-are-there style. Supporting-role casting decisions seem to have been based more on humor than brawn with Gleeson and especially Bill Paxton as the troop leader contributing a healthy amount of levity for this sort of fare. But these guys essentially disappear in the late-going leaving it to the stars to do the heavy lifting during the least engaging section making for a sense of considerably diminished returns. Cruises self-deprecation plays well a good thing in that hes really too old for this role while Blunt is toned burnished and physically refurbished into a blunt object something shes never remotely resembled before.

""Groundhog Day"" and ""Starship Troopers"" make surprisingly compatible bedfellows in ""Edge of Tomorrow"" a cleverly crafted and propulsively executed sci-fi thriller in which an untrained soldier must relive the same day over and over again -- expiring violently each time -- until he finds a way to defeat the alien marauders that have taken Earth hostage. That our ill-prepared hero is played by Tom Cruise lends a sly if perhaps unintended layer of subtext to this smarter-than-average star vehicle insofar as the now 51-year-old actor seems to have embraced a similar trial-and-error career strategy testing out one man-of-action persona after another in his ongoing (some would say undying) bid for bankability. Alas B.O. success is likely to elude him this time out as Warners June 6 release feels surprisingly low on buzz and audience awareness for an f/x-heavy picture with a 175 million pricetag. International returns will have to work extra-hard to make up the difference. Thats a shame because this enjoyably gimmicky entertainment is not only one of Cruises better recent efforts its also arguably the most purely pleasurable film Doug Liman has directed in the 12 years since ""The Bourne Identity."" And just as the amnesiac hero of that movie had to gradually get back in touch with his inner killing machine so the initially hapless aptly named Maj. William Cage (Cruise) must spend the better part of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" learning to unlock the ruthless soldier within. Introduced as a smiling representative of the United Defense Force an enormous military operation designed to defend Earth against a nearly invincible alien race known as Mimics Cage is a figurehead not a fighter which his why hes so dumbfounded when Gen. Brigham (Brendan Gleeson at his most hardass and no-nonsense) orders him into the front lines of battle even going so far as to arrest him when he tries to wriggle his way out. Despite Cages vigorous protests to his commanding officer (a fine Bill Paxton) that theres been some mistake his fate is sealed Strapped into bulky metal combat gear and equipped with high-grade weaponry that he has no clue how to operate Cage along with his fellow soldiers is deployed from London and deposited none too gently on a French beach where a fiery humans-vs.-Mimics battle is raging at full force. Its hardly an accident that the setting immediately evokes Normandy and while what follows isnt exactly the opening sequence from ""Saving Private Ryan"" its a brutal massacre all the same The humans are gravely outnumbered and even UDFs star soldier the tough-as-hell Rita (Emily Blunt) is killed in the onslaught. Through sheer dumb luck Cage does manage to destroy one particularly ugly oversized Mimic only to lose his own life when he gets a faceful of the creatures highly corrosive blood. End of movie? Not quite. To his utter disbelief (although audiences will suspend theirs easily enough) Cage awakens to find that the day has started all over again and once more he must attempt to talk his way out of the situation get dropped into battle and try to survive the bloodbath on the beach as long as he can. Every time he dies the clock is reset and he gets another chance to reshape the future though it will take many many replays before he learns how to navigate this particular cinematic videogame -- where dying is as harmless as it is in ""Candy Crush"" if rather more painful -- and reach the elusive next level. The screenplay was adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazakas much-lauded 2004 novel ""All You Need Is Kill"" by Christopher McQuarrie who knows his way around a mind-bending mystery scenario (""The Usual Suspects"") and by Jez and John-Henry Butterworth who previously worked with Liman on ""Fair Game."" Crucially the scribes have solved the problem of how not to make the film play like a repetitive slog; aided enormously by James Herbert and Laura Jennings snappy intuitive editing they tell their story in a breezy narrative shorthand (and at times sleight-of-hand) transforming what must surely be an unbelievably tedious gauntlet for our hero into a deft playful and continually involving viewing experience. Among other things ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is a movie that slyly teaches you how to watch it. Under these tight structural constraints a months worth of replays can be dispensed with in minutes and an event that seems to be transpiring for the first time can turn out to be something Cage has already lived through on countless occasions. Over time he figures out that rather than try to warn his fellow soldiers that he has seen the future or fight his way off the beach his best tactic will be to track down Rita before the battle begins. And sure enough Rita not only immediately understands and believes what hes telling her but also has a trusty scientist friend (Noah Taylor) on hand who can at least partly explain how Cage at the precise moment of killing the Mimic became locked in a cycle of eternal recurrence. Its at this point that the picture really spreads its wings slowly illuminating the nutty rules that govern its futuristic universe while also allowing Cage and Rita to break free of each days restrictive pattern in search of a stealthier more effective plan of attack. If ""Groundhog Day"" is an obvious influence then those ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" novels are another (amusingly whenever Rita feels theyve taken a wrong or unproductive turn she simply whips out her gun and resets the clock). Perhaps predictably this is also the point at which ""Edge of Tomorrow"" blossoms into a love story of sorts and if this development feels a bit perfunctory and emotionally undercooked especially in the way it too easily softens Ritas tough-girl edges Liman handles it with a pleasing lightness of touch that extends to the proceedings as a whole. The final twists are likely to throw a few viewers for a temporal loop but by that point the film has more than earned their goodwill. Following his creditable if unremarkable work in ""Jack Reacher"" and ""Oblivion"" Cruise is in particularly appealing form here in no small part because the role is one he can ease himself into without pushing his undeniable charisma and physical prowess too aggressively. Although hes initially slick and confident qualities the actor could embody in his sleep (and probably does) Cage is soon revealed as a hopeless ineffectual soldier trying to stay alive and Cruise embodies this struggle with a refreshing lack of vanity that makes his eventual awesomeness -- the product of endless drilling supervised by a merciless Rita -- feel genuinely earned rather than a foregone conclusion. (Theres hate-viewing crossover potential here too Cruises non-fans could do worse than see a movie in which he basically dies 500 times and when hes not hes getting his ass handed to him by spiky combat-training attack dummies.) Blunt is alert energized and emotionally present in a none-too-taxing role; while a bit more action for Rita would not have gone awry the pleasure of ""Edge of Tomorrow"" is that its not an action movie first and foremost but rather a cheeky little puzzle picture in expensive-looking blockbuster drag. The excellent production package is distinguished by the expertly designed Mimics which resemble overgrown radioactive crustaceans that got caught in an oil spill as well as by the anamorphic 35mm work of d.p. Dion Beebe who shot Cruise so memorably in ""Collateral"" and who delivers a succession of stable balanced yet dynamic images on a color palette of metallic blues grays and browns. The picture will be released in 3D but looked fine in the 2D version screened for review. Film Review Edge of TomorrowReviewed at Dolby Laboratories Burbank Calif. May 8 2014. MPAA Rating PG-13.

Reply John Travers says June 16 2014 at 401 pm The cinematography was ""stable""????? Interesting. ""Stable"" is without question the one adjective I would never in a million years use to characterize this films photography. Shaky jittery and overexposed (exteriors) and muddy underlit and underexposed (interiors) are the ones that come to my mind. Maybe we saw two different movies Either that or you have come to accept Doug Limans home-movie style ""Shakicam"" technique and have completely forgotten what good cinematography is. Wow. From ""Rolling Stone"" I might expect this... but from a Variety reviewer its really depressing. Reply Tom Frank says June 7 2014 at 853 am Saw it last night. Great movie. Say what you want about Tom but he can still deliver the goods. Bravo Reply IT IT IT IT V says June 7 2014 at 152 am This about 4 decades STALE dystopic same-same. Reply Randall Starr Stinson says June 6 2014 at 834 pm It was a pretty damn cool movie. For what Oblivion offered in artwork and aesthetics this one offers in excitement. The downtime is paced so well and the story builds and builds in a way that was a refreshing break from three act formulaic action films. This one really respects the audience and offers something more. Reply dochi says June 6 2014 at 828 am Awesome movie Mind blowing concept Reply Martin says June 5 2014 at 641 pm Nicely written. Reply bjoj says May 23 2014 at 233 pm Looking really forward to this one. I still consider Minority Report a top futuristic Sci-Fi crime drama. Cruise is one of our best. Reply LOL says May 23 2014 at 1157 am The continuity-girl on the feature ought to have top-billing. (Tom Cruise is the last true movie star. America should give him more credit.)

Let the audience see it first asshole.. Dont spread negativity Reply BillUSA says May 22 2014 at 643 pm I think too much emphasis is placed upon advertising. It is a part of doing business but I dont buy into the notion that the lack of buzz for this film will have anything to do with the domestic gate. It will earn what it will earn solely for the presence of Tom Cruise. And that is why Im not interested in seeing this one. Im a science fiction enthusiast who loves a good film from a number of genres and Tom Cruise just doesnt deliver for me. His only range consists of playing an adult character as opposed to portraying teenagers early in his career. Hes a slightly more animated version of Ben Affleck who doesnt disappear in the roles he plays. Even for sci-fi I dont find the groundhog day premise appealing at all because its more of a cop-out than plot a device. So the advertising may have indeed helped to keep me away. I dont wish the film bad luck I just dont see the point of watching it because Tom Cruise and science fiction dont mix well. Reply demelzabunny says May 22 2014 at 620 pm And I will be watching solely for Jonas Armstrong Reply Katie Hickox says June 10 2014 at 1219 pm BIllUSA then you will be missing out my friend. This is not a typical Tom Cruise movie. He and Emily Blunt really knocked it out of the park. I did not like the movie Oblivion but I have actually been to the theater twice to see this movie- it is that good and incredibly unique. FYI I cannot even watch a movie with Ben Affleck in it- he is such a bad actor. It is ridiculous to compare TC to himGive it a shot You will be glad you did Reply gida says May 22 2014 at 716 pm Dude I luv the Jonas Brothers That said this movie has a cool soundtrack. Reply Ulkar Alakbarova says May 22 2014 at 246 pm Emily Blunt is a wonderful actress with great potential. Will be watching this film just because of her. Reply Chris says May 22 2014 at 332 pm And for me its Hiroshi Sakurazaka amp; Doug Liman Reply Ulkar Alakbarova says May 22 2014 at 539 pm Hope you like it Enjoy) jabberwolf says May 22 2014 at 245 pm I cant wait until the end of the movie -- where hes old and happy... 98 years old.. and dies.. only to find himself back being drafted into war - letting out a cry of dispair  A horric ending but I doubt theyll do that -) Reply See All 20 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content Westworld Divorce amp; Insecure Get Premiere Date On HBO Lindsay Lohan Without Engagement Ring Egor Tarabasov Wedding...
