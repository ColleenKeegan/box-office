""The Company Men"" plays like an account of perhaps the most pressing issue of the day -- job loss and the impact of the economic downturn -- as viewed from an upholstered armchair. Debut feature film from TV giant John Wells dramatizes with intelligence and evident ample research the increasingly desperate straits of one-time prosperous white-collar colleagues once theyre cut loose into a terrible job market. But the pain feels cushioned and secondhand the characters are not terribly sympathetic or interesting other than for their misfortune and the film shows little interest in analyzing the situation other than to point fingers at greedy CEOs. Despite its strong name cast the picture has more the air of a deluxe cable TV offering than of a viable theatrical attraction. At the storys center is Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) a young exec at Boston-based manufacturing giant GTX whose smug confidence when first seen playing golf at a country club is immediately off-putting. But his self-satisfaction is revoked when along with many others hes canned in a spasm of corporate downsizing. While Bobby cant hide the truth from his pragmatic wife Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt) he cant bring himself to admit it to anyone else as he continues to tool around town in his Porsche. His embarrassment and sheepishness are genuinely felt and the pic is at its best in conveying the loss of face and noting the accepted commonalities of upper-middle-class life that are actually luxuries rather than necessities. With 12 weeks severance Bobby sulkily attends motivational training and begins looking for work but its frigid out there. Next from GTX to join him in limbo is Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper) a considerably older man who with much bleaker job prospects goes into a quick tailspin. And its hard to blame him after a counselor advises him to dye his gray hair take his Vietnam War service off his resume and not mention any jobs he held before the 1990s. Then theres Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) GTXs No. 2 man who founded the company with CEO James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson) but in the current cutthroat environment represents the sole voice of conscience. He unsuccessfully fights to save Phil from the blade and increasingly argues a more humane p.o.v. to James whose bottom-line view is that jobs can be given and jobs can be taken away. Ironically Gene whose fancy wife is preoccupied with the corporate jet and expensive furniture carries on a secret affair with GTX hatchet woman (Maria Bello). In a startlingly short period of time Bobby and Maggie can no longer meet their mortgage payments. Suitably humbled Bobby takes a job carrying lumber and fetching coffee for his barely tolerated working-class brother-in-law Jack (Kevin Costner) a building contractor with a small crew. This creates an opportunity to ponder the relative satisfactions of jobs that involve guys in suits moving numbers around versus manual labor that results as Gene nostalgically puts it in ""building something you could see."" As it happens some of the numbers cited here dont really add up in a modern context. Bobby is said to have made 125000 a year at GTX but that wouldnt be nearly enough to support his beautiful and very large old colonial in a great neighborhood as well as all the extras; nor would such a house be devalued even in the recession to only 650000. Wells sets his sights mostly on educated traditionally upwardly mobile whites which is fine; one of his main points is how this historically solid mainstay of American life is being pushed to the brink of endangered-species status. But the importance Jack assumes late in the game in that at least this working stiff is in a position to hire people even if his profit margins have been whittled to virtually nothing suggests so much more potential to the story. Stylistic approach notably the cool immaculate images of lenser Roger Deakins and the quietly but disconcertingly perky score by Aaron Zigman further ensures that raw visceral impact will not count among the pictures virtues. Affleck carries the film reasonably well but one isnt convinced that even with all Bobby has gone through the character has changed in any fundamental ways by the end; indeed it would be a surprise if in a new job he would behave any differently than when he was at GTX. Although her characters uniform rationality and supportiveness are hardly compelling DeWitt is vividly alive in every moment. Cooper Jones and Nelson shrewdly underplay in cagey-old-vet fashion while Costners common man seems years younger and healthier.

Who knew? The directorial debut of ER creator John Wells proceeds as if it has discovered a new continent or something but even if the materials not exactly news fine performances and a keen eye for character detail mean theres much to appreciate. Ben Affleck is well cast as the cocksure sales director who loses his 160000 salary when a shipping and logistics giant downsizes to boost its share prices. Clearly he needs his sense of entitlement cut down to size especially when he pooh-poohs an offer from his builder brother-in-law Kevin Costner of work on site to tide him over. Higher up the food chain long-standing company man Chris Cooper is in denial as the axe starts to hover while founding partner Tommy Lee Jones proves almost unaccountably shocked by the speed with which his buddy CEO Craig T Nelson jettisons loyal workers to protect his own stock options.So greed has displaced loyalty and number-crunching and techno-babble now reign in a land where manufacturers once took pride in building things. The camera glides through an abandoned shipyard with palpable longing for the old days - a cliche certainly but invested with sincerity here. While the aforementioned star names provide a good deal more nuance and humanity than the sometimes clunky script its that sense of place which impresses here. The tacky faux-heritage houses packed with overpriced gewgaws and soulless decors of corporateland suggest careers spent working towards ultimately vapid lives. Setting up Costners salt-of-the-earth type in telling contrast is way too schematic but Kevs deliciously grumpy underplayed turn helps the movie just about get away with it.

How to sympathse with men who extend themselves to live in suburban mansions that would cost several million pounds in London? Although not explicitly stated it is clear that all these company men are victims of the work-achievement-spend and credit society that they take for granted is the only admirable way to live. Even the villainous CEO who ends up wth stock worth 600 million and no friends can be seen as a victim.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 14 2011MikeFeaturedThis is a tale of the late noughties the stock market crash the wider consequences of corporate greed and keeping up personal and corporate appearances. The casting is excellent (Bello Lee-Jones and Cooper in particular) with the exception of Ben Affleck who for the most part is good but in two places could have easily been switched with a cardboard cut out for a more realistic performance. That said the story revolves around Afflecks character and family and the whole thing gels very well. Unfortunately the endings cheesey - especially Afflecks little speech - this scene could have been written/performed in a number of other ways with a much better result. In an age of cutbacks this story will send a shiver down the spine of many who watch it. Including me there was an audience of six (no one left ""Scrumpyjack""). Is it because of the bad film title or because of Affleck that few seem to have seen this film and Im the first to leave a comment? Like I say its good and as choked as I am to say it about an Affleck movie it genuinely warrants three stars because of the performances by the rest of the cast.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/89650/the-company-men.html,200,thecompanymen1,thecompanymen,timeout

Photo by Folger/ The Weinstein Company Photo Credit The Weinstein Company Photo/ advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Three men feel the effects of a shrinking economy. BOTTOM LINE Well-timed but simple-minded with rich villains poor heroes and a feel-great ending. CAST Ben Affleck Tommy Lee Jones Chris Cooper Kevin Costner WHEN/WHERE ""The Company Men"" showtimes and tickets LENGTH 144 Who and what to blame for the crippled economy all the lost jobs and homes and dreams? ""The Company Men"" about downsizing at a giant manufacturing concern doesnt provide any clearer answers than the professional apoplectics on cable television. The film strives to be a thoughtful evenhanded drama but ends up shooting only the easiest targets. The title refers to three executives at GTX a multinational something-or-other that is shedding jobs even while building new headquarters. Chopped by the ax are middle-manager Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) upper-floor fixture Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper) and even higher exec co-founder Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones). advertisement | advertise on newsday Its a lopsided cross-section of high-earners - the cheapest car anyone drives is a Porsche - yet the film has the gall to make a villain of GTX top-dog James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson). When Salinger complains about shareholder losses McClary snidely points to a hanging canvas ""Then sell the Degas eh?"" Touche except that McClary lives on an estate the size of Liechtenstein. John Wells a producer of the NBC shows ""The West Wing"" and ""ER"" makes his directorial debut here with his own script but hes still thinking small screen. Everything is pat from the stereotyped characters (Kevin Costner plays the noble blue-collar worker) to the obvious plot turns. McClarys moist-eyed monologue about a time ""before we got lost in paperwork and cost reports"" beggars belief - were there unicorns then too? The implausible upbeat ending makes the film feel like some kind of pilot for a TV series. You can almost see the ""timely"" episodes and ""topical"" themes all neatly wrapped up before the commercial break.

Company Men Upbeat ending doesnt ring true in Company Men BY CALVIN WILSON  calvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com  314-340-8346 Feb 4 2011 (...) The Weinstein Company Ben Affleck and Rosemarie DeWitt in The Company Men (The Weinstein Co.) Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) never thought hed be downsized -- or have to do any downsizing of his own. But the company that made it possible for him to buy a Porsche has presented Bobby with a pink slip. That means he has to give up not only the Porsche but also his big beautiful suburban home.Sure his wife Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt) understands and their kids are young enough to adjust. But Bobby feels like a loser. Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper) is in worse shape. Pushing 60 and suddenly jobless hes infuriated with the company. His desperation only deepens when a business acquaintance informs him that no ones interested in hiring an executive his age regardless of his credentials.Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) who co-founded the company sincerely feels the pain of those who have been laid off. But hes powerless to do anything but bow to the bottom line. ""The Company Men"" was written and directed by John Wells who is best known for his work on the television series ""ER."" Although the film has its moments it plays as if Wells feared delivering a downer. That would explain the spectacularly unpersuasive happy ending and the relentlessly upbeat soundtrack. Theres also little sense of what these characters were like before reality came crashing down on them.Affleck comes across as more of an indignant frat boy than a discredited family man. As the guilt-ridden McClary Jones seems slightly off his game. But Cooper turns in a strong performance and Kevin Costner makes the most of his small role as Bobbys proudly working-class brother-in-law.As a drama about coping with hard times ""The Company Men"" doesnt come close to being as sharp or entertaining as ""Up in the Air"" -- which starred Wells ""ER"" associate George Clooney.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post In ""The Company Men"" Ben Affleck Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper play highly compensated employees of a shipbuilding concern that has grown into a transportation conglomerate. The economic drama follows division honcho Gene McClary (Jones) and ace salesmen Bobby Walker (Affleck) and Phil Woodward (Cooper) as their relationship to the company -- and each other -- changes under them. The year is 2008. Like many corporations GTX is being socked by the markets and global competition. Pink slips flutter down. Sleek and unsentimental attorney Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello) wields the ax while CEO and co-founder James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson) tries to make the company attractive to a buyer. Written and directed by John Wells (executive producer of ""ER"" and ""The West Wing"") the movie engages an economic calamity that isnt quite done with us yet. Even as the waters of the Great Recession appear to ever so slowly recede it doesnt feel exactly safe. Recently reported profits of the financial sector cant mitigate the wariness. The dam of the debt could burst swamping the nation and beyond. It cant be easy for a distributor to gauge the hunger for a drama about hard times even one founded on sturdy performances. Yet ""The Company Men"" is a worthwhile outing that takes despair -- but also resilience -- seriously. In structure if not quite stature the film recalls William Wylers 1946 postwar classic ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" Like that drama this one follows its characters as they return home from battle -- a daily war that they are not winning -- to their mates. Or in the case of Jones character his wife and a younger mistress who plays a role in the disaster befalling his beloved company. The title has a 1950s flavor and there is something deliberately prefeminist about its domestic dramas. It isnt just the pressure on the menfolk to bear up to give so much more to their kids than they had. There is also an expectation of fringe benefits on the part of the wives. Phils wife and daughter appear to leave him alone with his sense of impending catastrophe. (Of course he does little to warn them.) Ignoring his glum affect Cynthia McClary asks Gene ""Can we get the corporate jet?"" It is less a question than an assumption. Patricia Kalember does ice- shard work as the wife whose status is overinflated. Bobbys wife Maggie proves an exception. Rosemarie DeWitt performs quiet heroics as a woman who accepts the plenty but isnt addicted to it. Theres little panic in her. Shes pragmatic. Her sense of self comes from her own work in a hospital and her blue-collar roots. Kevin Costner arrives on site as Maggies gruff older brother a building contractor. Jack is fond of needling Bobby but his family values run deeper than his rhetoric. All the male leads do crafted work. Cooper in particular deftly spins the dial from fury to anguish to humiliation. ""Ill take an AK-47 to this place"" he tells Gene as the atmosphere of ""and then there were none"" permeates GTX. Hes right to worry. Older better-paid employees figure high on the downsizing lists. ""The Company Men"" takes on the meaning of labor loved and lost; the future of U.S. manufacturing; and the competing loyalties publicly traded companies have to employees and shareholders. Last year the dramedy ""Up in the Air"" sold the comforting idea that severance could be the start of ones best life. Maybe times have eased after all. Because ""The Company Men"" doesnt allow audiences to forget just how hard the end of work can be.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 21 2011 1052 AM The Company Men Ben Affleck Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper as well-off white guys who get nipped by the financial crisis. By Dana Stevens Tommy Lee Jones and Ben Affleck in The Company Men Two years into the global financial crisis its time we started thinking about the other guys. The well-off comfortably oblivious guys men who might not have been directly responsible for the ruinous market bubble but who certainly enjoyed a long run of benefiting from it before their jobs and lives began to crumble beneath them. The Company Men (The Weinstein Co.) the feature film debut of ER creator John Wells is a thoughtful tasteful and timely tribute to a few such men. If only the results werent so respectably dull. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Company Men establishes its three main storylines with impressive swiftness Minutes into the movies opening sequence we know all we need to about Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) and Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper). All three men work for a company called GTX a Boston shipbuilding concern thats rapidly morphing into a huge transportation conglomerate a place that rather than manufacturing a product churns out profit for its shareholders. Recession-induced downsizing has already cost Bobby his job and the two older mens positions are in imminent jeopardy. Gene stands a chance of hanging on to his spot as vice president of the company--after all hes having an extramarital affair with the H.R. executive in charge of downsizing (Maria Bello). But Phil an old-school company man used to steak-and-martini work lunches completely loses his bearings when hes thrown into the world of resume-jiggering and corporate self-help seminars. Advertisement Bobbys stay-at-home wife the pragmatic Maggie (a dryly funny Rosemarie DeWitt) has trouble impressing on him the repercussions of whats happened Not only will he have to give up golfing and buying expensive gadgets for the kids; they may have to sell their nice suburban house. Bobby chafes at every indignity of unemployment--most of all the affirmations hes encouraged to repeat at those self-help seminars--but hes finally forced to swallow his pride and ask his working-class brother-in-law Jack (Kevin Costner) for a job putting up drywall with Jacks contracting business. Heres the place where I guess Im supposed to poke fun at Kevin Costner--but damned if (along with DeWitt) he isnt one of the best things in the movie even if his Boston accent sounds a bit raw. Yes the character of the salt-of-the-earth working man is a sentimentalized type but Costner doesnt play it for nobility; his Jack Dolan is a fundamentally decent fellow but no saint. Jack regards his successful and occasionally condescending brother-in-law with wry irony. When Bobby after some initial resistance begins to extol the spiritual satisfactions of manual labor Jack gently reminds him that his carpentry skills arent all that. Maybe the reason this solidly acted handsome-looking movie never takes flight is because of the casting of Ben Affleck as the central character. Affleck is the Dockers of actors serviceable preppy bland. He seems to occupy a separate acting planet from Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper men whose deep-set eyes and worn faces suggest a lifetime of back story before they even say a word. But though Jones and Cooper are as always satisfying to watch the older executives at GTX never really come alive either. Their character arcs are too stiffly scripted; especially in the case of the Cooper character we foresee every story beat one scene before it comes. The Company Men has a dramatically muffled quality thats probably intentional. Successful white American men have never been a group renowned for their emotional openness. Indeed much of the movies action revolves around these mens entrenched resistance to personal or professional change. Not once but twice Tommy Lee Jones V.P. takes another character on a nostalgic walk through the abandoned shipyard remembering how ""We used to build something here."" Its a sentiment that anyone whos lived through the boom-and-bust cycle of the last few decades has at one time or another felt in their bones. But the venerated American export that The Company Men most recalls isnt seagoing vessels--its hourlong dramatic television shows. Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 21 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Thursday Jan. 20 2011 309PM EST Comments AA Country USA Language English As the American economy freefalls a trio of execs at different stages in their careers - Gene the venerable senior manager Phil the good old soldier and Bob the young up-and-comer - all get axed by a big bad corporation loyal only to its bottom line. What follows means to be a sensitive account of their subsequent travails but the math here is overambitious and the film itself struggles to do justice to each victim. Turns out three stories are two too many. The Company Men should have been downsized. Writer-director John Wells has an impressive resume on episodic television ( ER The West Wing) but thats part of the problem. In dramatic series the small screen allows for slower character development among ensemble casts rewards longer story arcs and forgives lazy plotting. Of course those same assets become deficits in the truncated confines of a one-off feature and Wells clearly hasnt figured out how to make the necessary adjustments. His movie suffers accordingly. Its all hurry-up-and-wait meandering one moment hasty the next here unbalanced and messy there too tidy and neat. Bob (Ben Affleck) takes up most of the camera time. When we first see him hes riding low in his Porsche and living high on the hog - six-figure salary gorgeous wife sprawling house country club privileges. Down comes the axe and the next year brings about a dramatic change in that litany - Porsche gone house sold zero job offers severance package run dry reduced to hanging drywall with his brother-in-law Jack. With Gene the big wig (Tommy Lee Jones) the blow is ironically softened by the achieved effects of the downsizing the share price is protected. Consequently Gene may be out of a job but with his stock options secure hes not out of pocket. The same cant be said of poor Phil (Chris Cooper) who spent most of his 60 years working his way through the blue-collar ranks to join the suits in the executive suite. His climb was long; the fall promises to be steep. With his main players in place Wells intercuts among them but constrained by time he takes to rigging the game thereby undermining the best efforts of a very solid cast. Surprisingly corporate malfeasance isnt on Wellss agenda nor to his credit are simple villains and easy finger-wagging. Instead he errs on the side of sentimentality converting his three protagonists into maudlin stereotypes or rhetorical mouthpieces. Phil inevitably is the clamouring voice of doom - his fate is telegraphed early and often. With every line on his craggy face whispering wisdom and empathy Gene is the nostalgic voice of integrity the one that after offering us a tour of the citys once bustling and now abandoned shipyards longs for the bygone era when men were ""building something they could see and not just figures on a balance sheet."" Lest anyone miss the point Jack the generous carpenter (Kevin Costner) is there to further rebuild our faith in honest hands-on labour. That leaves Bob as the voice of learned experience. Oh his bank account is empty and his 7-iron rusty but having traded in the corporate ladder for an aluminum model darned if he isnt spending more time with his son enjoying better sex with his wife. This is getting perilously close (speaking of TV) to the Waltons school of sententious nonsense where relative poverty is less a hardship to be endured than a virtue to be sanctified. Meanwhile way over in subplot territory weathered Gene is risking his integrity by dumping his botoxed wife to continue an affair with Sally the HR henchwoman. But not to worry. As if reserved for some future episode that little tangent disappears as fast as it arrives. Quick too is the tacked-on ending the kind that defies belief and is fraught with contradiction yet does have the merit of literalness - see that actual ship on actual water and yes see their ship come in. No doubt its social intentions are sincere but the execution along with the honesty always feels manufactured and the result is a film that plays like a generic product stamped out for a receptive buyer in a tight market. In other words The Company Men toes the company line.

He learns quickly that some choices are out of his hands and this is only the beginning. Starring Ben Affleck Kevin Costner Maria Bello Tommy Lee Jones Chris Cooper Craig T. Nelson Rosemarie DeWitt John Doman Liam Ferguson Tonye Patano Director John Wells Running time 153 Release Opened Jan 21 2011  Editorial Review The pressures of downsizingBy Stephanie MerryFriday January 21 2011With the unemployment rate stubbornly dwelling around the double digits the story of ""The Company Men"" will no doubt hit close to American homes A massive corporation responds to flagging profits and shareholder anxiety with layoffs. But writer-director John Wells uses the timely big-picture scenario to dive into the details with a trio of character studies chronicling how the pressures of downsizing affect three men and their families.Much like last years George Clooney hit ""Up in the Air"" this tale smacks viewers with a reality thats hard to imagine paying money to see in a theater. And yet here we are. The first casualty is Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) a cocky salesman and father of two who gets his pink slip alongside a handful of other employees. This initial round of staff cuts practically torments Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper) whos nearing retirement age and seems convinced hes next on the chopping block and infuriates Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) one of the companys first employees and the CEOs oldest friend.Bobby initially seems like the least sympathetic of the three. For starters hes obsessed with appearances; he drives a Porsche boasts about his golf game and tries to keep his unemployment a secret from everyone but his wife. He also tells an interviewer shes overweight and declares himself above construction work to his brother-in-law (played by Kevin Costner) who happens to work in construction.And yet watching Bobby go through the classic steps -- denial anger self-loathing acceptance -- feels as authentic as it is compelling. Hes not a bad guy he has just lost track of whats important and Affleck nails the role continuing his ascent from near cinematic oblivion.Likewise Coopers frenzy is palpable. Hes a self-made man on the brink of a nervous breakdown at the thought of losing his job just as his daughters Ivy League tuition payments are rolling in. And the always dependable Jones does what he does best whether hes in ""No Country for Old Men"" or ""The Fugitive"" as the conflicted veteran. In this case he gets to take the corporate jet on business trips and has the kind of house that requires multiple Christmas trees but at what cost to others? He admits to loving the 500 lunches and 5000 hotel suites yet hes disillusioned with the business practices of his friend and boss James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson). Salinger is one of the movies few weak spots. Hes a caricature of an evil CEO taking home a boatload of money while unloading employees left and right. His superficial character may be especially striking in contrast to the well-drawn and nuanced personalities that make up most of the movie.Otherwise the film feels painfully real. Some people manage to push through the depression-fueled inertia of unemployment some realize that cars and vacations arent air and water; others dont. And whats most interesting if devastating is that like the layoffs it all feels a bit arbitrary. Any of the characters could go either way. In other words maybe it is worth spending money to see this reality after all. Contains language and brief nudity.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Company Men   (out of four)Stars Ben Affleck Tommy Lee Jones Chris CooperDirector John WellsDistributor The Weinstein Co.Rating R for language and brief nudityRunning time 1 hour 53 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Scott Bowles USA TODAY It doesnt tread much new ground but say this for The Company Men The film isnt afraid to wear its Cartier on its sleeve. Thats the blessing and one of the few drawbacks of this drama from ERand The West Wingscribe John Wells making his directorial debut. Where the sublime Up in the Air and last years documentary Inside Job tally the recessions toll on working Americans The Company Men examines the hardships facing executives getting pink-slipped. The movie is less effective at explaining why we should care. While Ben Affleck Chris Cooper and Tommy Lee Jones turn in sterling performances the lot of their characters is so blessed it can be hard to sympathize with their fall. And their idea of hardship -- a smaller house sensible car no 500 lunches -- doesnt exactly send chills. Still Company doesnt apologize for its worldview from above the glass ceiling -- and that reverse perspective carries the film until it stumbles briefly beneath some unnecessary lecturing near the end. Company opens with three executives from a Boston-area conglomerate literally adjusting their white collars on their way to work. But Bobby (Affleck) is about to get a half-day after learning hes been downsized. The film follows Bobby and his former co-workers Phil (Cooper) and Gene (Jones) as they struggle to maintain or replace the jobs that define them. The Company Men flourishes when it moves from the private jets and centers on the family corrosion that springs from any job loss. The tension between Bobby and his wife Maggie (the terrific Rosemarie DeWitt) provides the film an emotional center. And Affleck shines whenever he returns to his Boston roots (The Town Gone Baby Gone both of which he directed). His accent is natural and he shifts easily from Armani suits to overalls. Cooper and Jones are solid as always especially when they share a scene. The 56-year-old Kevin Costner who plays a soft-spoken carpenter seems to be relishing his multiplying roles as an aging Everyman. The Company Men stumbles slightly in the final stretch when Jones is asked to become the conscience of corporate America and the script clobbers with some car-ad sentiments namely that we should get back a country where we made things for a living. Its simple stuff but the movies heart is in the right place. And theres something cathartic if not wholly effectual in Companys message Even for the Italian sports car set things are tough.

Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Like the Johnny-come-lately Iraq drama ""Green Zone"" ""The Company Men"" arrives with a wealth of talent and honorable intentions and about three years tardy. An efficient message picture about the human toll of corporate downsizing its too far behind the curve to have much impact. Last years ""Up in the Air"" slipped in just before the cutoff date. Unless there are nostalgic viewers eager to revisit the nadir of the Great Recession theres not much new information here to compel your attention. The film does offer a novel focus however. It follows three executives who range from prosperous to filthy rich as they transition to post-corporate life. Ben Affleck plays Porsche-driving hotshot Bobby Walker a midlevel executive at GTX a Boston conglomerate that will be more profitable without the shipbuilding subsidiary that employs him. A couple of rungs farther up the ladder and the seniority chart is Chris Cooper as senior manager Phil Woodward. Just below the CEO theres Tommy Lee Jones as Gene McClary the firms financial honcho and unofficial conscience -- surely a luxury in todays ever leaner and meaner environment. Each man follows a different path when the pink slip arrives while dealing with similar issues of disappointment resentment and uncertainty. Writer/director John Wells one of the movers behind TVs ""The West Wing"" and ""ER"" launched the project after some family members lost their jobs and his treatment of the subject is subtle realistic and sensitive. Affleck who saw his own high-flying career shot down after disastrous choices like ""Gigli"" looks genuinely stricken when his character realizes hes just ""a suit and a resume"" and that he has been living far beyond his means. Still its his wife (a strong turn by Rosemary DeWitt) who restructures the household budget in line with his plummeting income. The change in his relationship with his abrasive contractor brother-in-law (Kevin Costner) when he comes asking for work is wonderfully observed. The builder is quietly pleased that Mr. High-and-Mighty got his comeuppance. And he savors the opportunity to rebuke Bobby for his sloppy carpentry. Cooper conjures a bubbling vat of stomach acid as a middle manager struggling to make sense of the current employment market. The indignity of his situation is painful to behold and with less time to rebound his desperation is palpable. For the first time he realizes that to the world at large he looks old and his eyes are shocked. Feed Loader Weinstein Co. Kevin Costner and Ben Affleck in ""The Company Men."" Jones who glides comfortably to earth with a golden parachute is decent enough to be troubled by whats happening to his colleagues to say nothing of his industry and his country. When youre a companys co-founder fired by your partner and best friend so he can hang a few more Impressionist paintings on his wall thats a special kind of hurt. Although his lifestyle is the most lavish -- his wife decorates their mansion for the holidays like a deluxe department store -- hes the least concerned with appearances. Its deeply worrying to him that the United States doesnt manufacture anything but complex financial instruments anymore. As he surveys an abandoned shipyard his expression is infinitely sad. All these are good ideas expressed with professional craft but so late to the game. ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and ""Office Space"" made most of the same points vividly long ago. ""The Company Men"" is a lovingly prepared dish served cold and stale.

Will they sink or swim?Filmed nearly two years ago and still timely the movie bristles with torn-from-todays-headlines subjects as did Wells E.R. and The West Wing. (The movie like those shows similarly revolves around workplace relationships.) Its principal assets are the incisive performances by Tommy Lee Jones Chris Cooper and Ben Affleck as employees of the fictional GTX a company that cares more about maximizing profits than its root business.GTX was their family; now it is their ex-wife.One by one these white-collar men with mortgages and wives and children are cut loose. First its Bobby (Affleck) the upbeat salesman whose well of optimism runs dry when he spends months at a fluorescent-lit placement center thats the waiting room to jobless hell.Next its Phil (Cooper) the Vietnam vet promoted from factory floor to management pink-slipped because the cruise ships GTX ordered for construction in boom times are in down times like anvils in quicksand.Then theres Gene (Jones at his gruffest) who cofounded the firm with CEO James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson) and takes aim at his best friend for spending millions on new headquarters instead of keeping jobs.Though not blessed with a cinematic eye Wells is a gifted storyteller who gets nuanced performances from most of his actors. The exceptions are Nelson and Maria Bello the dragon lady of GTXs HR department one-dimensional villains who care only about their stock options.For one who rides mass transit a scene where Bobby trades down his Porsche for a Ford Focus might inspire eye-rolling but Wells gets at the universals of unemployment. The shame of being a bread loser hits Bobby and Phil hard. If what you do is who you are if you do nothing are you nothing? We see them lose their pride and then their homes.The ray of light in this cloudy economic forecast is Kevin Costner potent as Jack Bobbys brother-in-law a construction worker contemptuous of guys who have resumA(c)s instead of tangible skills.Jack emerges as the stealth hero of the movie the one who sacrifices his own profits in order to employ guys like his much-resented brother-in-law who need work.Inching from the desperate to the hopeful The Company Men comes down squarely against those who make deals in favor of those who make things.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Comments click to enlarge The Company Men Recommended Video Rated R  115 minutes  2011 Jason Reitmans romantic comedy Up in the Air scored points with critics by touching on the fear and anger of Americas unemployed but this potent entirely honorable drama by veteran TV dramatist John Wells actually delivers the goods pondering the pain and dislocation of the new normal. Ben Affleck is a gung ho executive in the shipbuilding division of a heavy machinery corporation who gets laid off in a downsizing and is forced to move his family in with his parents; Chris Cooper is a 60-year-old veteran waiting for the ax to fall and Tommy Lee Jones is the cofounder of the business whose concern for the people being laid off in waves to maximize the stock price pushes him into conflict with his old business partner. Wells may strain ones sympathy by giving his narrative over to wealthy white-collar men but he also acutely renders the shame and frustration of capable hardworking people suddenly forced to reassess their earning potential and aspirations in life.

Cross a weak episode of ""I Love Lucy"" with a reel of ""Bananas"" and you get ""Company Man"" a consistently silly occasionally funny but mostly forced account of how a mild-mannered teacher from Connecticut unwittingly triggered the Bay of Pigs fiasco. Released in France ahead of the U.S. where it is scheduled to open in the fall pic manages to be set in the early 60s and feel exactly like it was made then. Name cast is obviously having fun but box office prospects for this riff on the CIAs wacky efforts to embarrass and depose Fidel Castro look as iffy as a permanent Florida home for Elian Gonzalez. Pic begins in the wake of the Bay of Pigs debacle with a two-senator panel interrogating CIA officer Allen Quimp (co-scripter/co-helmer Douglas McGrath). Story unfolds in flashback as nerdy good-natured Quimp recounts his misadventures starting in 1959 in Greenwich where hes perfectly content teaching grammar and drivers ed at a prep school. But Quimps demanding wife Daisy (Sigourney Weaver looking fab in full suburban regalia) craves a fur coat and all the other things they cant manage on a teachers salary. She and her dad badger Quimp mercilessly to get a big-bucks managerial post in Manhattan. While in the steam bath at the Valencia Country Club with his father-in-law Quimp avers that teaching is just a cover for his real job in the CIA. Daisy thrilled by the news announces shes going to write a steamy bestseller about his adventures defending democracy and promptly spreads word of her husbands profession. So open is the secret that touring Russian dancer Rudolph Petrov (Ryan Phillippe) defects directly to Quimp. The CIA ends up welcoming Quimp into the fold so the agency can take credit for Petrovs move. Quimp is shipped to ""a Third World backwater"" -- Cuba -- where local CIA station chief Lowther (Woody Allen) says that Quimps predecessor Crocker Johnson was a lunatic who kept insisting the island was on the brink of armed revolution and that theres a mole Agent X passing secrets to the Russians. Quimp promptly unmasks Agent X whom headquarters has sought for over two years. Daisy then shows up just as Agent Johnson (an adrenaline-crazed John Turturro) crashes through their window with none other than Gen. Batista (Alan Cumming) in tow. Fidel Castro (Anthony LaPaglia) has just seized power and the commie-hating Johnson wants to get to the bearded interloper post-haste (""Do you think I went into the CIA just because it was easy to spell?""). As Daisy types her juicy book Quimp suggests less violent ploys for destroying Castros credibility. Less frenetic but also less hit-or-miss than a ZAZ extravaganza pic sends up the pre-Austin Powers 60s with more comic affection than satirical bite. Marilyn Monroe JFK and others figure in the proceedings which often seem downright courtly and mild compared with contempo standards for madcap comedy. Cumming Weaver and a strutting LaPaglia employ a manic glee thats cartoonish but called for opposite McGraths milquetoast whos at his best when compulsively lecturing others on their grammar flaws. As the Cuba station chief Allen with whom McGrath co-wrote ""Bullets Over Broadway"" is nicely modulated. Lensing is mostly adequate with bygone America succinctly captured in garb and furnishings and Puerto Rico standing in for Cuba.

TWITTER PARK CITY -- ""The Company Men"" looks at corporate downsizing squarely in the face that is the faces of startled men some still relatively young but others much older whose whole self-image crumbles in a matter of moments. American movies rarely catch the American male so nakedly powerless and shattered. Writer-director John Wells after a long career as a major force in television brings the quiet muscle and energy of the small screen to the large one with this his first feature as a director. Naturally Wells attracts top-flight talent so this first-timer has Ben Affleck Chris Cooper Kevin Costner and Tommy Lee Jones to head his cast. That ought to help out a film that could meet considerable boxoffice resistance. Those who have been laid off know all about this and those hanging on probably dont want to hear about it A distributor can expect only modest returns although the film may show up in college courses in a decade or two when students study the calamitous recession of the early 21st century. No its not the great Depression and this is not The Grapes of Wrath. This is about middle- and upper-class men and their families who bought into the American dream and the greed-is-good mentality only to have a corporate run pulled from under them. Some react with denial such as hot-shot sales agent Bobby Walker (Affleck). He doesnt even want to cancel his golf club membership. His boss Gene McClary (Jones) reacts with rage over these layoffs behind his back only to get sharply rebuked by longtime friend and corporate head James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson) Its not his call. A second wave of layoffs at this large manufacturing conglomerate sweeps Phil Woodward (Cooper) overboard. He is too old to land any job better than a school-crossing guard. His experience counts for nothing. Dying his hair isnt going to help. The ripple effect moves out to their families. Bobbys wife Maggie (Rosemary DeWitt) is the levelheaded one but she must manage not only the familys dwindling finances but also her husbands ugly mood swings. Her brother Jack (Costner) offers Bobby a job with his construction business but that falls drastically short of Bobbys self-image. Gene clearly sees the company he helped to build now focuses less on what it manufactures than keeping the share prices up. And he watches his old friend turn into a cowardly self-interested owner/executive who has lost any feelings for his employees. With all the upheavals in everyones life Gene even leaves his wife for of all people the conglomerates hit lady Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello). Strange bedfellows. Wells doesnt let much sunshine into his doom-and-gloom scenario. Thats no doubt realistic but it does make the movie one long downer. What Wells strives to get across is that these layoffs force all his company men to take a hard look at themselves their self images and their values. Few have spent much time with their families; in some cases that may be by design. In any event they come to understand how they once measured success and achievement no longer works. Just how important is that Porsche anyway? How do earnings factor into family relationships? Wells offers neither easy answers nor saving solutions for his troubled men. He suggests improving ones personal life may be a place to start the rebuilding but its just a suggestion and clearly everyone is not up to the task Again the rookie film director benefits from contributions from first-class personnel. Cinematographer Roger Deakins mutes the colors but keeps everything crisp and clean. Production designer David Bomba contrasts the corporate boardrooms and offices with bleak corridors and reception areas where the unemployed camp out looking for work. Wells also displays a fine visual acumen that nails a truth in a single shot Rows of empty desks confront a befuddled executive and a job seeker sits down next to a long line of fellow job seekers a third his age. Wells has made for his first film a tough movie and certainly not a commercial one. This displays the kind of guts he always brought to his television work which one can only hope continues on in other future film projects.

"Movie review Jobless in America in The Company Men | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMovie review Jobless in America in The Company MenThe words are never spoken but ""its not personal its business"" is the repeated lie at the heart of The Company Men.John Wellss moody tale about the death by a thousand cuts of a foundering Boston ship-building firm gets help from an outstanding castTommy Lee Jones left and Ben Affleck in a scene from The Company Men.  (AP PHOTO / THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterMon. Jan. 24 2011 (out of 4) Starring Ben Affleck Chris Cooper Tommy Lee Jones Rosemarie DeWitt and Kevin Costner. Written and directed by John Wells. 102 minutes. At major theatres. 14A The words are never spoken but ""its not personal its business"" is the repeated lie at the heart of The Company Men. The two perspectives collide effectively in John Wellss moody tale about the death by a thousand cuts of a foundering Boston ship-building firm where the workers are the casualties and the stockholders get the spoils. Tommy Lee Jones is Gene the conscience of the company who founded manufacturer GTX with college roommate Jim (Craig T. Nelson). The collaboration was successful enough to keep them both in mansions private jets and 500 lunches. But no more. ""We work for the stockholders now"" Jim reminds his executives as he signals the axe to swing kneecapping a few thousand workers including 37-year-old sales hotshot Bobby (Ben Affleck). Its not just the bosses who dont want to recognize whose blood is spilled when the cuts come. Fellow workers also make this business personal stopping by Bobbys desk first to commiserate then to wonder aloud if their jobs are safe. Convinced hell find a job long before his three-month severance package runs out -- no need to tell anyone or let the kids or the neighbours know -- Bobby and wife Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt) retreat inside their spacious Cape Cod home. Hes cocky about his prospects but Maggie is calling realtors and questioning Porsche payments. Keeping secrets from the family is important to Bobby who awkwardly tries to maintain a veneer of normalcy and keep his pride intact; he especially cant let his blue-collar blowhard brother-in-law Jack find out (Kevin Costner almost unrecognizable as a chubby bitter beer swiller with thinning hair). Costner takes on the smallish role with enthusiasm and lack of ego playing the hard-labouring boss of a small construction firm who delights in greeting Bobby with acerbic barbs about the corporate worlds skewering of the American worker. Freshman director Wells who helmed some of TVs most impactful ensemble-cast dramas including The West Wing provides a script that holds few surprises. The cast does the heavy lifting here and carries the movie over the predictable bits exploring the rising panic of families who face the devastation of job loss with disturbing realism. Jones excels as the straight-talking married Gene who demands the truth be told about business but isnt above some personal subterfuge when it comes to the cool blonde corporate hatchet woman (Maria Bello) who keeps him occupied in pricey hotel rooms Tuesday afternoons. Affleck handles the role of working everyman Bobby with quiet ease and DeWitt is a perfect match as his wife who doesnt let pragmatism disturb her sense of loyalty. But the movie belongs to Chris Cooper as fading executive Phil. With his baggy eyes and hangdog expression Cooper makes Phil every inch the pathetic soul who started out welding ships and now tries to sell them while nervously worrying aloud about his future. He cant believe Gene could let the reaper come for him. Pushing 60 and afraid Phil isnt made for job centre cattle calls and going up against ambitious youngsters although he fancies he can. Maybe dying his hair will help. But business contacts he goes to for help put on false cheerfulness as they say they envy his early retirement what financially stretched Phil sees as catastrophe as he faces the crushing realization that as his world crumbles nobody notices. Theres nothing unfamiliar here for anybody who works in an office or on a factory floor. Seeing people trudge to the elevator with packed boxes tearful goodbyes anger and sorrow are as much a part of the pattern of working life today as Gene musing hes worth half a million more than he was when he woke up that morning. Layoffs bring a rise in stock prices that will protect the company and isnt that why GTX is doing it? Wells has opted to take a positive turn with the final act rather than the more ambiguous ending of Jason Reitmans superior look at the downsizing of America in the Oscar-nominated Up in the Air. A risky choice on Wellss part but one that ultimately pays off. Hope also has a part to play in this story and it would be unfair to exclude it. So too is the realization that no matter where you are in the corporate structure job loss is the great cruel equalizer.

The Company Men Good Director John Wells. Cast Ben Affleck Tommy Lee Jones Chris Cooper. Rating R for language and brief nudity. In ""The Company Men"" we see the effects from the other side - on the people who go to work one day expecting more of the usual grind and go home with their personal effects packed in a cardboard box. The film is not quite as satisfying as ""Up in the Air"" the George Clooney drama that got at the hollow loneliness of life on the road while telling its story. But John Wells the television veteran who wrote and directed ""The Company Men"" taps into the ""whats next"" frustrations faced by so many people who have lost their jobs in the past few years. >> Guide to this weeks new releases Thats not a pretty story of course. But its a compelling one and thanks to Wells and a cast that includes Ben Affleck Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper an entertaining one. Wells job is made more difficult by virtue of the characters being fat cats feeding at the trough of privilege and excess. But the talent of the cast - Affleck continuing a career renaissance is particularly good - lends a humanity to the characters that might otherwise have gone missing. Bobby Walker (Affleck) lives the good life working for GTX a conglomerate whose original business was shipbuilding but which now includes all manner of things. Bobby has a great house drives his Porsche from the club to the office and brags about the low round he shot on the golf course. He is in other words insufferable. Then suddenly as a result of a continuing series of downsizings hes also unemployed. No one disputes how good he is at his job very. GTX simply doesnt need him anymore and hes gone in an instant along with thousands of others. Eventually their number will include Phil Woodward (Cooper) who rose from being a welder to the executive ranks and Gene McClary (Jones) the No. 2 man who helped start the company and disdains the direction it has taken. ""The Company Men"" follows the three as they try to fit into new lives. Bobby befitting his self-image figures it will be a week or two until he finds something suitable. He scoffs at an offer from Jack (Kevin Costner) his brother-in-law to help him remodel houses; hes equally dismissive of warnings from his wife Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt) that they are now immediately living beyond their means. Phil who had dreaded the ax falling for a long time struggles from the start. Its as if his dread of the ax and the misery that would come with it have become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Hes near 60; a counselor advises him to dye his hair omit from his resume his work experience before the 1990s and change his service in Vietnam to something more generic. His wife demands that he suit up every day and not return till 6 lest the neighbors learn he has been canned. Gene hangs on at GTX the longest and has the most comfortable nest egg. Thus it falls to him to make the films philosophical speeches about the importance of working hard to make tangible things things you can be proud of. In a lesser actors hands this would come off as eye-rolling pabulum but Jones is such a commanding screen presence that we take note. Happy endings are hard to come by in any story about the nations economic woes real or fictional. Wells ties up a few elements too neatly. But before he gets there the journey of the characters particularly Bobby is timely and telling. It may be somewhat predictable that losing material wealth will make Bobby more human but Affleck is outstanding. The look on his face as disappointment piles atop letdown tells us all we need to know about the man His life as he knows it is slipping away as it has for so many. ""The Company Men"" is a worthwhile chronicling of that experience however difficult it may be.

"The Company Men (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Company Men (R) Rebuilding your life in a downsized economy isnt easy Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald1/20/2011 Editor rating 2.5 We see their possessions before we meet them these company men who are about to become redundant. The antique furniture the ridiculously expensive sports cars the huge houses with sprawling yards are more than just symbols of success. Theyre requirements in this six-figure-salary world. But as this topical but predictable film by John Wells opens the U.S. economy is melting down and Global Transportation Systems led by its avaricious CEO (Craig T. Nelson dutifully checking in as the requisite corporate villain) is downsizing operations in Boston to placate nervous stockholders. Among the first to be fired is salesman Bob Walker (Ben Affleck) but some of his bosses are right behind him including Phil (Chris Cooper) whos pushing 60 and Gene (Tommy Lee Jones) one of the companys founders whose shipbuilding division is taking the hardest hit. Theres a Company Woman too in the form of Maria Bello as a human-resources specialist present to fire people and to tamp down the testosterone in the film to a manageable level. The Company Men follows a year of the ups and downs of the men as they venture into the brave new world of under-employment. Gene of course has the benefit of stock options; his parachute may be golden but his guilt is mighty. He frets over the death of U.S. manufacturing and talks a lot about ethics but hes not going to lose his house to foreclosure any time soon. But Bob (who cant quite walk away from his country club) and Phil (who cant bear to tell his daughter she cant join the senior-class trip to Italy) are in far worse shape especially as time passes and neither finds a job. Phil at least has an all-too-clear grip on his predicament. The petulant Bob blows up at job interviews and refuses to discuss cutting the family budget though his patient wife (Rosemarie DeWitt good in a thankless role) tries to explain they can no longer afford the house or the payments on his Porsche. Youd think a guy who once made six figures would be smart enough to figure all this out but Bob is stubborn. Worse he rudely snubs his builder brother-in-law (Kevin Costner) who offers Bob a job working construction. We know though Bob must eventually acquiesce in order to reassess his priorities and rediscover his soul. Such transformation can only happen through the nobility of a blue-collar job. The film is disdainful of the wealthy and positively entranced with salt-of-the-earth working men after all. This sort of unimaginative set-up hampers The Company Men; you are always aware of where the story is heading. Still the film remains relatively entertaining simply because the scenario hits so close to home no matter where you work. The actors -- in particular the always-excellent Cooper -- gamely delivers their less than evocative dialogue (""My life ended and nobody noticed"" Phil tells Gene plaintively). And even when the plights of these exceedingly well-off men seem less than dire the films depiction of our human need for fulfilling work and the perils of an unforgiving job market are sadly familiar to us all.

"Strong effort yields merely adequate Company - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Strong effort yields merely adequate CompanyGreat cast in the service of a so-so movie a 2 1/2 starsJanuary 20 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticA single spontaneous moment pops up in the otherwise obsessively well-ordered ensemble drama ""The Company Men"" written and directed by ""ER"" and ""West Wing"" alum John Wells. Its a quick shot in a hotel room tryst of Maria Bello bopping back into frame unexpectedly with a wolfish grin on her face as her character -- a corporate layoff specialist -- bids farewell to her lover a high-flying but soul-corroded executive played by Tommy Lee Jones. The actors in this tale of recessionary morals ethics and consequences are all very good from Ben Affleck (as Bobby the central figure struggling with a grim job market and plummeting self-esteem) to Rosemarie DeWitt (terrific in ""Rachel Getting Married"" and on ""Mad Men"" as the nurse married to Bobby) to Kevin Costner (as Jack Dolan Bobbys brother-in-law). The craft throughout in ""The Company Men"" is clean organized thorough and cinematographer Roger Deakins lends an honest shine to every image. Deakins truly is a first-time feature film directors best pal. The results can be appreciated for a lot of reasons yet theyre frustrating. Wells casts a wide but synthetic net. An aura of well-intentioned generica muffles the dramatic impact of ""The Company Men"" set among the survivors and the recently downsized of a Boston-based shipbuilding and transporation company. Bobby a marketing and sales expert copes with crushing house payments and an increasingly distant relationship with his loved ones. (Hes saved spiritually by going to work temporarily for his blue-collar salt-of-the-earth brother-in-law.) ""You want honesty Maggie?"" Affleck says at a typical speech-y juncture. ""Im a 37-year-old unemployed loser who cant support his family."" Maybe Wells has written too much successful series television for too long; he has talent but not every line need be excerptable for promotional and sound-bite purposes. Wells is no crushing realist He wants to offer a full dose of hope and comfort to Americas afflicted classes (middle and upper-middle especially) with his story. ""They were good people Jim"" bemoans Jones conscience-stricken executive regarding the recently canned. ""Not our responsibility"" replies the honcho played with as much humanity as the writing allows by Craig T. Nelson. ""We work for the stockholders now."" Id like to think the earnest sentiments and machine-tooled dramatic complications of Wells script could find a receptive audience in late 2010. Id like to think too that the mess were in demands a tougher gutsier script. Darn good cast though. MPAA Rating R (language and brief nudity) Cast Ben Affleck (Bobby); Tommy Lee Jones (Gene); Chris Cooper (Phil); Rosemarie DeWitt (Maggie); Maria Bello (Sally); Kevin Costner (Jack); Craig T. Nelson (Salinger) Credits Written and directed by John Wells; produced by Claire Rudnick Polstein Paula Weinstein and John Wells. A Weinstein Company release. Running time 144.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""The Company Men is about American white-collar entitlement and the abyss that opens up when its taken away.Maybe youre not sympathetic. An enormous amount of struggle and privation have come out of the economic collapse of 2008 and it may occur to you that the problems of a handful of executive VPs and mid-level sales managers dont amount to a hill of beans to quote the sage Rick Blaine. At its worst ""The Company Men asks us to weep for people who had money to save and spent it on Porsches.At its best the movie understands that many of us made a similar mistake -- not the Porsche (I wish) but the belief that a job a house comfort and consumption were part of the natural order of things secure guarantees of an unquestioned American way of life. ""The Company Men is interested in what happens when people are forced to question that way in its sudden absence.The setting is a huge Boston-area conglomerate with roots in shipbuilding and our main point man is that sales manager Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck). At this point in his career Affleck has outgrown his early smugness to the point where he can use it as a character flaw. Much of ""The Company Men is about Bobbys slow relentless humbling and the actor plays it beautifully. Bobby cant believe hell be laid off and then he cant believe hell be at the outplacement center for long and then he cant believe he may have to sell his house and take on construction work. And then he has to not only believe it but find a measure of acceptance in his altered horizons.The expressions on the faces of the other characters are more panicked They know the ax is coming but cant believe itll land on them. Tommy Lee Jones plays Gene McClary a company cofounder who took a secondary position while his best friend (Craig T. Nelson) became a captain of industry. Gene has prided himself on being the thorn in the CEOs side urging him to do the right thing yet hes still surprised when his blunt talk gets him pushed out the door. He returns to a Marblehead mansion and a wife who mean nothing to him.The women in ""The Company Men either get it -- a warm believably distressed Rosemarie DeWitt as Bobbys wife -- or they dont and are never heard from again. The movie doesnt know what to make of those in the middle like Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello) whos both Genes mistress and the human resources hatchet woman who has to fire him. ""Company Men is too earnest and well-intentioned to make sense of a character that conflicted and Bello flounders attractively but to little purpose. ""Company Men does need a designated victim though and so we have Chris Cooper giving daring shades of neediness to the part of Phil Woodward the third firee. The actor twists his face into an ugly mask of rejection; Phils job is the only thing propping him up and without it he gives off a stink of failure that sends the other characters fleeing. Coopers performance suggests a nervier nastier movie than the one we get.The writer-director is John Wells making his filmmaking debut after a very successful TV career (""The West Wing ""ER). To borrow a phrase from the review my colleague isnt writing ""The Company Men is good enough to make you want to see the next episode. Theres a democratic gentleness to the storytelling that extends almost but not quite to Nelsons bluff heartless CEO. A scene where the laid-off men throw rocks at the companys sparkling new headquarters is in its anger and helplessness the most honest moment in the movie.That upwardly-directed rage might have taken ""The Company Men further but Wells has the instincts and technique of a top-flight TV man and his approach is smooth to a fault. Whether youre in a forgiving frame of mind or not this movie is. Still its nice to see a Boston movie thats not about criminality that gets at the rhythms of the outer suburbs and seacoast villages and that plays fair by the areas class divisions. Kevin Costner taps into a new side of himself as Bobbys blue-collar brother-in-law and his contempt and unspoken kindness both feel real. (Realer at least than the Bahstan accent that sounded forced in ""Thirteen Days and still does here.)Thankfully ""The Company Men doesnt lean on the local flavor. It knows this is an American story rather than a New England one and the movies at its strongest sketching in the desperate cheer of subsidiary characters trying to get by in a system they thought was created for them. It wasnt but Wells wont or cant or darent go there. The result is like its characters a good and decent film in a world that rather heartlessly demands more.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

The Company Men Director John Wells Genre Drama Running Time 113 minutes Rated R for language and brief nudity With Ben Affleck Tommy Lee Jones Kevin Costner Chris Cooper Maria Bello When people go to the movies theyre often trying to get away from real-world concerns. So it may seem odd that layoffs and a rough economy should be the subject of a star-heavy story like The Company Men. Maybe not so odd at awards time though. After all Up in the Air plumbed this same well around this time last year. Company Men follows three executives caught in a downsizing convulsion at a shipbuilding company. Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) has been living the suburban dream -- gorgeous house happy family golf at the club on weekends. He has a spring in his step even on the morning when his tales of triumph on the back nine are meet with long faces and hes told hes being laid off. Bobby is among the first to hear that heads are rolling. And while no one is happy about that fact some are less happy than others including a 60-something lifer (Chris Cooper) whos worked his way up from the wharf to an executive suite. Also unhappy is the companys co-founder (Tommy Lee Jones) who bristles as lawyers argue about how to downsize crossing off the names of people they know only by the notations on their HR forms. His own head is soon on the chopping block. i Afflecks Bobby eventually finds work with his brother-in-law Jack Dolan (Kevin Costner) -- in construction doing a job hed initially scorned. Folger/The Weinstein Co. hide caption toggle caption Folger/The Weinstein Co. Afflecks Bobby eventually finds work with his brother-in-law Jack Dolan (Kevin Costner) -- in construction doing a job hed initially scorned. Folger/The Weinstein Co. These are lets note white-collar executives losing their jobs -- executives who were pricing stock options as the economy heated up and who may have been responsible in part for its overheating. Their taste for Porsches and pricey antiques makes them a little hard to cozy up to but the filmmakers acknowledge the class issues at work even as the audience is registering them. Bobbys got a blue-collar brother-in-law (Kevin Costner) who vents a whole different set of issues around the Thanksgiving table; when he offers Bobby a job hanging wallboard Afflecks suit-and-tie guy is too cocky to accept -- until his severance pay runs out. When The Company Men premiered early this year at Sundance some thought it felt like a companion piece to Up in the Air the George Clooney picture that tackled RIFs and layoffs in a less down-to-earth way. Perhaps because weve had 10 months of discouraging employment numbers since then the more straightforward approach taken in The Company Men feels more in tune with today. Yes the films a little didactic as it lays out the issues. But when it comes to the emotional state of those being laid off of their families and even of those doing the laying off it gets things right enough to make audiences squirm.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) has it all. Second-in-command at the Massachusetts multinational firm GTX he lives in a Tara-like mansion -- two Christmas trees in the foyer -- with a wife who airily asks if she can use one of the corporate jets for a shopping trip to Palm Springs. He spends the occasional lunch hour in a hotel bed with his blond mistress Sally Wilcox (Maria Bello) the companys HR chief. When GTX stock spikes after the announcement of a drastic staff layoff Gene glumly notes he got a half-million dollars richer that morning. Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) has a lot. GTXs top salesman he pulls in 125000 to 160000 a year -- the number keeps changing depending on whom hes talking to -- and spends every bit of it on his nice wife Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt) and their two kids plus the showplace home the Porsche the golf-club membership the Patriots season tickets and all the other benefits of upward mobility that Bobby seems to think are inscribed in the Constitution. His inalienable perks. (See how Americans are spending now.) Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper) has something a mid-level job at GTX. And then he doesnt. ""My life ended"" he observes ""and nobody noticed."" One by one these men and hundreds of their GTX colleagues join the millions who have lost their jobs in the current Great Recession. Gene Bobby and Phil have worked their whole careers at a company to which theyve devoted at least as much time and energy as they have to their families. GTX is their family; and getting fired from it is like being suddenly disowned by your dad. These upper-middle class men probably thought their decades of expert service and the levels theyve risen to would insulate them from redundancy. But now theyve been sent out into a constricted job market where ""working class"" means only those who have work. John Wellss The Company Men is a juicy judicious drama and one of the few current movies to address an issue that affects many of the people who will see it -- or because reality is too depressing avoid it. Like Charles Fergusons documentary expose Inside Job which examines the cupidity that led to the 2008 financial meltdown The Company Men touches on the American core value of knee-jerk optimism the belief so deep its just assumed that the graph line will keep rising. That presumption is as addictive and disastrous to individuals as it was to investors. Mortgage holders thought housing prices would never drop; Bobby doesnt bother planning for the future because his present was the American dream. Funny thing about dreams you wake up. (See 25 people to blame for the financial crisis.) Wells was executive producer of two primetime hits created by movie writers -- Michael Crichtons ER and Aaron Sorkins The West Wing -- and he fills his first film as writer-director with the virtues of intelligent TV drama character nuance relevance to the real world an even pace that bespeaks trust in an audiences interest and intelligence. Written in the first fester of the Recession and shot in the spring of 2009 the film is playing for a week in New York and Los Angeles to qualify for this years Oscars. It begins a wider release Jan. 21. Gene who helped build GTX with the firms CEO James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson) figures his stature and status affords him the right to speak the truth. When Salinger argues that he has to fire people so the shareholders can ""maximize their investment"" Gene glances at the multimillion-dollar art on Salingers office wall and says ""Sell the f---in Degas."" He tells Salinger and Sally that Phil is irreplaceable; when he hears that Phil got canned Gene storms off to see Sally. She tells him that hes gone too. (See the 100 best movies of all time.) Bobby believes that nothing succeeds like the image of success; still tooling around in his Porsche he wants to keep his new shame a secret. Cockiness was one of his sales strategies but that arrogance sours into condescension as he goes to a work-placement center to begin his new nonpaying job begging for a break from people he doesnt know. Or worse people he does. Even worse than that his family. The golden boy of the Walker clan has to consider two ugly propositions that he Maggie and the kids may have to sell their house and movie in with his parents; and that he may have to take a job offer -- it may be no more than a taunt -- from Maggies construction-worker brother Jack (Kevin Costner). Jacks whispered contempt for Bobby can turn any family dinner into a breeding ground for ulcers; he calls his brother-in-law ""just another asshole with a resume."" Theyve lost their jobs and now theyve lost their dignity. Phil pushing 60 needs Botox and hair dye to get his foot in a door; a combat veteran from Vietnam (in his teens if our math is right) hes advised not to specify which war. And Bobbys glories at GTX mean nothing at other companies where further indignities await him. For white-collar men of a certain age the scenes of Bobby sitting in some companys tacky reception area -- hopeful and desperate as he waits for a short interview with an executive who if he shows up at all treats the candidate like a street mendicant -- will carry the same sick dread as anticipating the monsters arrival in horror movies does for teens; it chills the heart turns the stomach. The Company Men has earned some rapturously empathetic reviews from film critics perhaps because they belong to a job sector thats also suffered severe downsizing in the past few years. The movie is no masterpiece its music score cues the audiences emotions unnecessarily and too obviously; and theres more wish than fulfillment in a denouement that convenes an army of the expendables to make a fresh start. Wells also does Salinger the CEO a disservice by drawing him as a self-deluding charlatan -- a guy who cant be bothered to calibrate how many employees he could have retained instead of sinking millions into his Taj Mahal of a new office building. And why doesnt the boss fire his old friend Gene himself rather than hand the chore to Sally? Because even a nuanced study needs a cartoon villain. (See TIMEs Hollywood covers.) Like the best TV series though The Company Men is rich thoughtful assured; it doesnt huff and puff toward hysteria as so many big-screen films do. And its cast manages to suggest the raspy camaraderie of actors whove been around each other for years. Jones who can make a blank stare look both pensive and homicidal has the gruff gravitas of a man whos made his way to the top and doesnt lose heart or insight when he hits bottom. Affleck always has trouble simulating high emotion which hes called on to do once or twice but he nails Bobbys plunge from hubris to humiliation. And boy does Costner get inside Jack who for half his life has carried a grudge against the more favored Bobby. His rancor has been simmering for so long it neednt come to a boil to be scalding. He has the rage that men who work with their hands feel for much wealthier men who he says ""push papers from the In box to the Out box"" -- the artisans resentment of the scam artist. Call John Wells an artist and an artisan. He built this thing which is about a subject that matters -- its business is everyones -- and invests this story of men at the end of a career with the same vigorous subtlety the Sorkin brought to The Social Network a fable of men at the enthralling beginning. In its solid construction and resistance to the winds of fashion The Company Men is one edifice that could outlast many an action blockbuster or standard inspirational drama and maybe the Great Recession itself.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> A small movie yes but one with a large achingly humane theme the effect of corporate downsizing on the soul as well as the wallet. At first you may not give a crap about what happens to white guys in suits who lose their jobs at GTX a Boston manufacturing company. Theres a stench of arrogance around Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck in top form) what with the chichi house wife (Rosemarie DeWitt) kids Porsche and golf-club membership. When he loses his position and privileges Bobby has to beg jobs from his wifes blue-collar brother Jack (a terrific Kevin Costner) a building contractor who works with his hands not a spreadsheet. At a motivational center Bobby runs into Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper) an older guy freshly dumped by GTX and advised to dye his hair and take anything off his resume that suggests he had a career before 1990. The company CEO James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson) isnt losing sleep from cutting staff. The only compassion comes from number-two man Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones). Writer John Wells in an impressive feature directing debut tosses a lot of balls in the air that he cant always keep airborne. And his TV roots on ER and The West Wing result in softening edges that are better left unsandpapered. But Wells is a wonder with actors -- Cooper and Jones earn top honors -- and a filmmaker with an instinct for the emotions that bleed between the lines.

"The Company Men review Executives cut loose search for the upside of downsizing |       NJ.com comments The Company Men review Executives cut loose search for the upside of downsizing Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on December 10 2010 at 802 AM View/Post Comments Tommy Lee Jones left and Ben Affleck portray fired executives in the timely drama ""The Company Men."" There are very few adults who havent at some point over the last few years at least wondered what they would do if they were laid off. And usually some well-meaning person says something chipper like ""Look a jobs what you do -- not who you are."" But the sad truth of it is if youre working your job is a huge part of who you are. Youre a writer or a mechanic or a salesman. You provide for yourself and maybe a family. Thats your purpose. Thats why you get out of bed. Lose that and youve lost more than a paycheck. In ""The Company Men"" we look at three executives at a Fortune 500 company. The CEO wants to ward off a takeover bid by driving up the stock price; cutting payroll is the quickest fix. So the pink slips start going out by the thousands. To hotshot salesman Ben Affleck. To upper-management Chris Cooper. And finally to second-in-command Tommy Lee Jones. All of whom suddenly find themselves trying to define themselves when they no longer have a job to do it for them. Its ""Up in the Air"" told from the other side of the desk. Movie Review The Company Men (R) The Weinstein Company (113 min. Directed by John Wells. With Ben Affleck Tommy Lee Jones Chris Cooper. Now playing in New York. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS Yet even though ""The Company Men"" stands not with the hatchet man but the hatcheted it may have problems engendering sympathy for its fat cats. (Affleck the lowest paid says late in the film that with bonuses he routinely pulled down 160000 a year -- and yet seems to have saved barely anything.) A director has to work hard to tug tears for privileged people like that -- particularly ones who have squandered those privileges. But John Wells -- whose credits include ""E.R."" ""The West Wing"" and other top TV series -- is willing to work hard. And although he focuses too much on Afflecks yuppie (who does get taken down a few pegs although not soon enough) he creates a couple of other interesting people. One is Jones exec a weary old lion of the boardroom who wonders if things didnt start to go wrong once we stopped making things and contented ourselves with merely making our quarterly numbers. Another is Afflecks brother-in-law juicily played by Kevin Costner. A proudly blue-collar guy he knows all about sweat-of-your-brow work. But he also knows that being a boss means more than just cutting checks at the end of the week. These two men are a world apart. And yet Wells suggests they have a lot in common. And if they are a dying breed -- well something big and important may be dying with them. Although Wells work on television was always on top-of-the-line shows it was on network series where character change is slight and story lines are eventually neatly resolved. Those failings show a bit in ""The Company Men"" as well and a little more obviously on the big screen. Of course for anyone whos looked at unemployment figures lately ""The Company Men"" is an uncomfortable experience and sometimes a moving one. But it labors too hard to reach a pat conclusion. We havent seen an end to the real-life drama after two years. Dont insult us by trying to give us one in two hours.

(Company Men Productions) Joe Neumaier Friday December 10 2010 400 AM Title The Company Men Employees of a Boston corporation face life after downsizing. With Ben Affleck Tommy Lee Jones Chris Cooper. Director John Wells. (144) R Language. At Lincoln Square.""The Company Men"" recalls 1946s great post-World War II drama ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and the reason isnt simply its trio of protagonists. The stresses and fears afflicting these office workers also stems from battle -- one with joblessness and identity.Beginning in the fall of 2008 Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) is in crisis mode. One of the first casualties of downsizing at his Boston-based transportation firm Bobby is initially in a state of denial though his wife (Rosemarie DeWitt) has the end of Bobbys layoff checks in sight when she starts reorganizing family expenses. Bobbys former co-worker Phil (Chris Cooper) is in a different boat when his pink slip comes being two decades older and not as savvy about the modern workforce.Meanwhile Gene (Tommy Lee Jones) a co-founder of the company is summarily fired by his best friend the bottom-line driven CEO (Craig T. Nelson). As Gene reluctantly rearranges his life to start a new firm Bobby builds houses with an in-law (Kevin Costner) to make ends meet and Phil slides closer to despair.Writer-director John Wells -- a driving force of TVs ""ER"" -- instills all of these men with dignity and humanity. The familiarity they also spark in us is due to the real-life stories they echo although Genes push from his high perch requires a greater leap of imagination despite Jones gruff-perfect performance.Cooper too hits the right tone as does Costner in his genial turn as a sharp-witted average guy. Affleck finishes up a fall that started big for him thanks to ""The Town"" with a solid mixture of anger confusion and confidence. As Bobby slumps down into a cubicle in the temporary workplace his ex-company sets up for laid-off employees his look of disbelief and disgust counters the sympathetic ones from all the veterans in the room. The strength of ""The Company Men"" is how it gives voice to every one of those emotions.

Three years or so into the worldwide economic melt down ""The Company Men"" deploys a Murderers Row of Oscar-winning ac tors in the latest of what is still less than a handful of movies examining the psychological and other costs of downsizing during the Great Recession. No were not talking about blue-collar workers yet. This acutely observed debut from TV producer John Wells (""ER"") examines an even more rarefied stratum than that of the white-collar workers in last years ""Up in the Air"" -- members of the managerial class forced to part with their fancy suburban homes Porsches and country-club memberships. At first I found it somewhat difficult to empathize with the arrogant Bobby Walker the newly dismissed divisional manager for a Boston-based conglomerate whose main business these days seems to be boosting its stock price by laying off thousands of people. Well-played by Ben Affleck in the latest triumph of his post-Bennifer comeback the stunned Bobby refuses to believe its anything more than a temporary setback since hes still a young hotshot. His wife (Rosemarie DeWitt) knows better and wants to put their house on the market stat. As the months roll by the unmistakable message is that if this can happen to a golden boy like Bobby it can happen to anyone. Eventually and with extreme reluctance Bobby accepts an offer of part-time work from his brother-in-law a building contractor (Kevin Costner in his best work in decades) who provides the films few moments of levity. If job prospects for Bobby are few theyre positively nonexistent for a former colleague pushing 60 poignantly played by Chris Cooper. He spends his days in bars to spare his wife the embarrassment of having the neighbors know hes joined the army of the unemployed. In many ways the heart of the story is Gene (Tommy Lee Jones) the No. 2 man at Bobbys former employer. Though hes having a ""Network""-style affair with the much younger human-resources officer (Maria Bello) wielding the ax Gene is growing increasingly uncomfortable with the machinations of his boss (Craig T. Nelson) with whom he founded the company. The extremely well-acted ""The Company Men"" ends on a hopeful note but Wells examines the repercussions of a layoff-based economy with devastating precision.

Whenever a new one comes along they want to know where it ranks if at all in the pantheon that includes such classics as ""Raging Bull"" ""Rocky"" and ""The Champ."" In the case of ""The Fighter a perfectly remarkable movie directed by David O. Russell Id suggest a different pantheon one thats reserved for the sort of spectacularly toxic families dramatized by Eugene ONeill. While the film handles itself well in the ring its brilliant in the arena of a blue-collar family that brutalizes its younger son and best hope for worldly success in the name of sustaining him. Watch a clip from ""The Fighter"" starring Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. A single image bespeaks both venues--recurrent almost robotic spasms of sparring between Micky Ward who is played by Mark Wahlberg and his half brother Dicky Eklund played by Christian Bale. (These are two phenomenal performances in fundamentally different styles.) Its the familiar image of a boxer working with his trainer yet the two men are locked in another kind of combat as well. Dicky the trainer was once a promising fighter who went the distance with Sugar Ray Leonard. (In a film based on a true story it remains a matter of dispute whether he knocked Sugar Ray down or whether his opponent simply slipped.) Now hes a wild-eyed crack-addicted caricature of his former self. Dicky may have taught his younger brother everything he knows about boxing but his continued presence as Mickys trainer has turned imprisoning. Instead of winning fights and moving up Micky stumbles from one seedy bout to another serving as a stepping stone for other fighters. Mr. Russell directed ""The Fighter"" with furious energy--the overlapping dialogue out-Altmans Robert Altman--and an exuberant sense of place (Lowell Mass. in the 1990s). The director has an unerring feel for his working-class characters and hes generous toward most of them though what he does with the brothers six sisters a kind of slatternly Greek chorus is hilariously grotesque. The script episodic but never uninteresting was written by Scott Silver Paul Tamasy and Eric Johnson. Hoyte Van Hoytema did the gritty cinematography a far cry from the cool formal beauty of his work in ""Let the Right One In."" ENLARGE Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale as battling brothers in The Fighter. Paramount Pictures The production does all of its participants proud. Mr. Wahlberg who had long championed a feature film about the brothers chose to play the role thats initially distinguished by its passivity. His performance is truly distinguished and deeply affecting. Micky has become more of a punching bag than anything else. He supports his family by absorbing physical punishment. The flamboyant role belongs to Mr. Bale. At the outset he seems to be playing it for crackpot grandiosity--Dicky sees himself as the star of a documentary thats being made about his career--but the documentary proves to be anything but admiring and Mr. Bales performance grows into a chilling study of deterioration and rage. (In one brief but frightening moment his little son imitates him by taking a punch at a locker door.) Family is the films central issue and a flinty conundrum when do familial ties become shackles and chains? Mickys family isnt dysfunctional its ruthlessly functional in destructive ways. According to its matriarch and business manager Alice--a formidable performance by Melissa Leo--Dicky still knows whats best for his brothers dwindling career. But Alices steely authority meets its unlikely match in the person of Mickys new girlfriend Charlene a college dropout whos tending bar in a local tavern. (Shes played by Amy Adams who is as tough tender smart and funny as she was ethereal and delightful in ""Enchanted."" What an actress and what range) Once Charlene enters the fray the plot takes a few arbitrary lurches but also some thrilling turns. Against all odds ""The Fighter"" snatches hope and then elation from the jaws of grinding defeat. Watch a clip from ""The Tourist"" starring Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp. ENLARGE Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp in The Tourist. Columbia PIctures The Tourist Sometimes it can be grisly fun to watch a movie thats been kept from view until the last moment because the studio knows its a stinker. But watching ""The Tourist"" with Angelina Jolie and Johnny Depp is just plain grisly. This woefully botched mystery-adventure-thriller-caper-romance-comedy or whatever it was meant to be is no fun at all. In fact the film set in Venice is grisly plus saddening since it was directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck the German filmmaker whose Oscar-winning debut feature ""The Lives of Others"" remains a recent treasure of the movie medium. Who knows how his pursuit of a Hollywood career landed him in such a rancid stew? The only clue is provided by surveillance. ""The Lives of Others"" was about East Germanys secret surveillance of its citizens whereas ""The Tourist"" involves the obsessive and sometimes electronic surveillance of Ms. Jolie as a sex object. She plays Elise a mysterious--or at least frozen-faced--sophisticate opposite Mr. Depps Frank who describes himself as a math teacher from Wisconsin. (The idiotic plot which never adds up has to do with money gangsters and mistaken identity.) Mr. Depp possibly expressing displeasure at the production as a whole plays his character with dead eyes and steadfast torpor. Ms. Jolies eyes arent dead exactly but theyre weirdly glazed and they work in concert with her pursed lips and exclamation-mark posture to create a kind of sex robot who swans around Venice as if on an invisible runway. Maybe that was her intention but no one could have intended what ""The Tourist"" came to be. Watch a clip from ""All Good Things"" starring Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst. All Good Things Andrew Jareckis first narrative feature takes a fictional look at a once-notorious and still unsolved missing persons case. The result is a queasy combination of speculation and dramatic invention with the ring of half-truth though the co-stars Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst add as much color as they can--not much--to a monochromatic script. The case involved Kathie Durst the wife of Robert Durst the son of a wealthy New York real-estate magnate. When she disappeared in 1982 her husband came under immediate suspicion but her body was never found and he was never tried for her murder. Because he remains a free man the filmmakers have changed the real-life names but theyve retained many of the circumstances--the title was taken from the name of the Vermont health-food store that the couple opened early in their marriage. And they have left little doubt that Mr. Dursts surrogate David Marks was not only a tortured monster but a murderer. Seven years ago in his debut documentary feature ""Capturing the Friedmans"" Mr. Jarecki used a remarkable trove of home movies and video footage to probe the mysteries of a Long Island family torn apart by charges involving child pornography and pedophilia. The results were enthralling although mysteries remained. In ""All Good Things"" mystery and ambiguity are in short supply. The script draws insistently obvious psychological connections. Frank Langellas Sanford Marks the family patriarch and Davids father suffocates his scenes as well as Davids spirit with a doomy presence. While Ms. Dunsts Katie is lovely at first the single-minded writing reduces her to bleak cliches. As for Mr. Gosling hes one of our finest actors and I cant wait to see him later this month in ""Blue Valentine"" but his talents are mostly trapped by Davids eerie inwardness and inexpressiveness. In a movie that professes to reopen a cold case the heros inner life remains a closed book. The Company Men In a somber drama that plays like a requiem for the American Dream you may welcome a few frivolities like the bedroom scene when Maria Bellos glamorous hatchet woman Sally throws herself on Tommy Lee Joness Gene a veteran shipyard chief and says ""Tell me more about capital depreciation."" A feature film debut by the veteran TV writer-producer John Wells ""The Company Men"" tells us much about the human costs of a fragile economy by tracking the experience of three men during a savage spasm of corporate downsizing. The movie is set in the present and the picture isnt pretty. ""American heavy manufacturing is dead"" declares the CEO of a conglomerate that includes ship building. The trios task is to find life in the postindustrial ruins. (Roger Deakins did a stylish job as always of photographing not only the ruins but the offices and board rooms of the companys sleek headquarters.) In addition to Mr. Jones the cast includes Ben Affleck as Bobby a corporate executive who cant believe that downward mobility will threaten his suburban house his golf club or his Porsche (Kevin Costner plays Bobbys carpenter brother-in-law); and Chris Cooper as Phil an industrial counterpart to Willy Loman who definitely can put a nut to a bolt having begun his career as a welder. For all his years doing ""E.R."" and other top-line TV series Mr. Wells hasnt yet tailored his techniques to the big screen. His actors line readings can be erratic--though I very much liked Rosemarie DeWitts performance as Bobbys wife--and the episodic ""E.R.""-like structure of the script vitiates the films emotional impact. Still ""The Company Men"" takes on its big subject forthrightly and in an era of service industries and financial instruments it celebrates the virtue of making useful things. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Flirting With Disaster (1996) David O. Russells sensationally funny second feature grabs your attention in the opening seconds when its hero Mel Coplin (Ben Stiller) announces the premise. Mel is adopted and has always wondered who his real parents are. Hes also married with a four-month-old baby boy. But he and his wife Nancy (Patricia Arquette) havent yet agreed on a name for their son because fatherhood has plunged Mel into an identity crisis that can be cured only by finding his roots. Tea Leoni is Tina Kalb the adoption agency case worker who wants to document his reunion for purposes of scholarly research. The Believer (2002) The mind of Danny Balint whos played with terrifying brilliance by Ryan Gosling works like a cracked prism that refracts lifes spectrum into black and white. Danny is Jewish a conceited yeshiva boy grown into a pugnacious young man. Danny is also an anti-Semitic skinhead who vandalizes synagogues and has no higher ambition in his cracked life than to kill Jews. Henry Beans remarkable film has troubled many viewers and no wonder. What its about is also what it requires for proper appreciation--the ability of the human mind to hold and even cherish diametrically opposite thoughts. Boiler Room (2000) Ben Affleck is Jim Young a charismatic bully--and acknowledged descendant of Alec Baldwins character in ""Glengarry Glen Ross""--riding herd on young wannabe millionaires as they pitch worthless stocks to gullible traders. Ben Youngers debut feature has dramatic energy--and money hunger--to match the giddy heights of the Dow at the time it was made. Giovanni Ribisi is the conflicted hero Seth Davis a judges son who dropped out of college to run an illegal casino in his apartment. The ensemble cast includes Vin Diesel Nia Long Tom Everett Scott and Nicky Katt. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Company Men marks the directorial debut of veteran TV producer John Wells (ER) and if anyone ever doubts what industry clout can do just consider the cast Wells has assembled here. Ben Affleck stars as a corporate sales manager who loses his job after a merger and has to enter the netherworld of outplacement services while clinging tenaciously to a life of privilege he can no longer afford. Chris Cooper plays a company lifer who sweats every round of downsizing. Tommy Lee Jones plays a bigwig trying to fight for the soul of the business he helped start. Craig T. Nelson plays a boss more concerned with business-news headlines than his employees. Maria Bello plays a ruthless HR rep. And Kevin Costner plays Afflecks blue-collar corporate-hating brother-in-law. Those actors--and some wonderfully moody Roger Deakins cinematography--help sell a Wells script that over-explains everything. Wells treats his story like its a set of bullet points about the perniciousness of stockholder-driven business decisions never letting a single ""the upper-middle class has it tough too"" or ""our families are the real wealth"" moment slip past him. But the cast doesnt treat The Company Men like a slideshow. They take something overly schematic and imbue it with real anxiety shame and humility. To be fair Wells isnt entirely asleep at the switch either. As might be expected from a man known for detail-oriented TV dramas The Company Men has an insider feel when it comes to how corporate layoffs work and how they affect workers of differing ages and social backgrounds. The movie is very clever in the way it repeatedly emphasizes that Nelson and Jones business has plenty of money at its disposal; it just has a weakening position in the stock market. (When asked how they could raise the capital to stave off a takeover Jones surveys Nelsons office wall and hisses ""We could sell a fuckin Degas."") The actual words in The Company Men are often too blunt but the movie gets its message across in subtler ways as when Affleck steps into the outplacement office for the first time with its shabby cubicles and flickering fluorescent lighting and realizes just how far hes fallen. The decor says more than any dialogue could.

Writer/director John Wells portrays the economic crisis and contemporary workplace experience through three representatives each of a distinct generation and origin who end up meeting somewhere in the middle. Bobby (Ben Affleck) is the cocky young hot shot with the perfect-seeming family forced to trade in his Porsche and his pride and take a job with the proudly-blue-collar brother (Kevin Costner) of his pragmatic wife (Rosemarie DeWitt). Bobbys two former colleagues both in post-middle-age/pre-retirement limbo are large-living still-idealistic-at-65 exec Gene (Tommy Lee Jones) and Phil (Chris Cooper) a fiftyish boozer who worked his way up to management from the factory floor and cant conceive of how to fill a day off the clock.Wells a sometime-producer for auteurs as disparate as Robert Altman Todd Haynes and John Waters is better known as the showrunner of massively successful network TV franchises such as ER and The West Wing. Wellss filmmaking stamp if you can call it that hews closely to his iconic TV brands Character is paramount over story and style--embodied by Wellss idiom-thick script Roger Deakinss coolly detail-oriented cinematography and Robert Frazens cross-cutting--serves primarily to elevate relatable types into archetypes heroic and/or tragic and/or triumphant and/or martyred. Wellss weakest link in terms of craft is pacing Here he takes his time setting up the distinct social strata and moving Bobby from one (country club) to another (construction site) almost as if he has a full season to flesh out arcs. The whiplash-quick happy ending probably intended as inspirational wish fulfillment actually comes off as kind of a joke.Even with its potentially noxious message--The Bad Economy Is Hard On Rich People Too--The Company Men was often spoken of as a cousin to another star-studded but decidedly middle-class-focused borderline indie about our crumbling society when it premiered at Sundance in January. Call it Up in the Air Too? (tagline This Time the Jets Are Private the Downsizing Is Personal).The surprise then was how well the gambit worked With uniformly excellent performances (Affleck--an actor well familiar with rising fast falling hard and having no choice but to work his way back into the winners circle one calculated decision at a time--is particularly satisfying) and a script that parceled out sentiment judiciously and left a fair amount unsaid The Company Men put movie-star faces on some of the least sympathetic victims of the financial crisis and still felt like a more mature reckoning with the moment than Jason Reitmans Oscar nominee. At the very least Maria Bellos Adulterous Woman As Symbol for the Chill of Corporate Culture subplot is a lot less simplistic than Vera Farmigas; maybe its another thing to chalk up to his experience as a producer of long-running ensemble soaps but Wells seems to know better than to manipulate his audience into falling in love with a heroine only to reveal that shes actually the biggest villain.But after nearly 12 months and a shorter more upbeat streamline from the Weinstein Companys own men The Company Men is less effective as an urgent portrait of our tough times--in part because were still living those times and are even more aware now that theres no quick happy ending. What still rings true however is the symbiotic link between money and masculinity. Not exactly dude-friendly (the pyrotechnics are all actorly and emasculation is as pervasive as the defense-mechanism body humor in a bromance) The Company Men is maybe best understood as a chick flick about dicks Before its too-easy conclusion the movie offers a multifaceted glimpse at what can happen when the connective tissue between a man and his source of income is cut and rarely suggests that it could be anything less than excruciating to stop the bleeding.

Thats the feeling that extends to every minute of The Company Men a shrewd timely and terrifically engrossing drama of white-collar reckoning that marks the feature directorial debut of writer-producer John Wells (ER). The movie is about the executives who pigged out on the capitalist gravy train -- the men swimming in stock options and 500 lunches. Why you may ask should we give a damn if they lose their jobs? Have no fear That skeptical class resentment is built right into the film. The Company Men is all too aware that the smugly gilded corporate elites it depicts are in fact the very sort of self-invested short-term-profit players who helped get this country into such trouble in the first place. As they watch their jobs disappear we behold their suddenly fraught lives with a mixture of sympathy and schadenfreude. The message might be Greedy scum-sucking corporate parasites are people too. The Company Men traces the tumbling fortunes of GTX a Boston conglomerate that grew out of a shipbuilding company and now finds that it has to consolidate and lay off hundreds of employees to please its shareholders. The first one to get the bad news is Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) a sales executive who has been living the plush suburban dream. This is one of those roles tailor-made for Afflecks fast-break charm his ability to play a ""winner"" cruising at too high an altitude. Chris Cooper exuding the weary toughness of an old mule is the veteran exec who gets the ax and discovers that pushing 60 he might as well be applying for jobs from a retirement home. Tommy Lee Jones as the idealistic but dried-up senior manager offers eloquent testimony to the manufacturing-based America that globalization helped to wither away and Kevin Costner as Bobbys carpenter brother-in-law does the finest character acting of his career. The dialogue pings and often stings. Yet The Company Men invites our compassion toward the men who glided along on a house-of-cards economy until it fell in on them too.

By Peter Rainer Film Critic October 22 2010 Save for later Saved Kevin Costner(L) and Ben Affleck in a scene from the new movie The Company Men. Newscom          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Someday there will be a film festival of movies about the Great Recession just as there have been festivals over the years devoted to Depression-era movies. Most of these movies then and now are far more interesting as sociology than as art. With this in mind you might want to wait for that hypothetical festival rather than hand over your hard-earned cash to see ""The Company Men"" starring Ben Affleck as Bobby Walker a hotshot executive at a Boston-based manufacturing corporation who is suddenly laid off. The writer-director John Wells hauls out all of the standard tropes - the grim motivational training seminars the unfeeling CEO (Craig T. Nelson) Bobbys aged co-worker (Chris Cooper) who joins him in the cold etc. - but despite the all-too-harrowing familiarity of these scenes they seem more like illustrations than dramatizations of trauma.A curious white-collar/blue-collar dichotomy is at work in this film Bobby finds recompense and redemption in his surly brother-in-laws building construction business. (Kevin Costner plays the brother-in-law.) Are we supposed to think that only those people who ""work with their hands"" are safe in this economy? Grade B- (Rated R for language and brief nudity.)
