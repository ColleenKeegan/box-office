E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + You may have heard that the ""Orson Welles part of ""Me and Orson Welles is a remarkable even staggering work of imposture. Its all true The British actor Christian McKay resurrects the young Welles as a magnificent mountain of talent ego and unsliced ham. He and he alone is reason enough to see this movie.The problem is the ""Me - Zac Efron.Contrary to what you may have heard or hoped the ""High School Musical heartthrob actually acquits himself well as Richard Samuels a 1937 New Jersey high school kid with Broadway stars in his eyes and the luck to fall in with Welless Mercury Theatre as theyre preparing the modern-dress production of ""Julius Caesar.Richard is callow and ambitious brash and naive; hes a bit of a user too. Efron captures all of that . . . and no more. In a film full of sharpies con artists real artists and tart-talking cynics of all stripes Richard lacks the ironic edge that would believably keep him in this company without being left for dead. Efron holds the screen and you do root for and admire Richard but you keep waiting for something interesting to happen in his eyes and it never comes.If you can get past that (I can) ""Me and Orson Welles is a richly pleasurable bit of fabulated pop history if not a lasting contribution to the art. Based on Robert Kaplows well-liked 2003 novel it represents a stretch for director Richard Linklater (""Before Sunset ""School of Rock) a period piece where every bit of dialogue is tilted sharply up against the next. Its the opposite of a movie like ""Slacker - everyone here speaks with witty concision and they never mean what they say.Richard has the luck to wan der into the Mercury as Welless ""Caesar is stumbling toward opening night and the film at its best captures the arch wonderful chaos of backstage life. For those who know the era theres fun to be had in spotting the troupes ladies man Joseph Cotten (James Tupper) courtly and patient producer John Houseman (Eddie Marsan) neurotic matinee idol George Coulouris (Ben Chaplin).Theres also the troupes girl Friday Sonja (Claire Danes) a Vassar grad hankering for a meeting with David O. Selznick. Shes everything about Manhattan Richard wants and cant quite have. (A girl like struggling writer Gretta sweetly played by Elia Kazans granddaughter Zoe is more his speed.)Towering above them all - literally - is Welles a man of titanic appetites (artistic sexual culinary) and the confidence to follow his muse while all around him are tearing out their hair. In truth the 35-year-old McKay is too old to play this particular Welles who at 22 still had it all ahead of him ""War of the Worlds ""Citizen Kane ""Magnificent Ambersons ignominy downfall renewal wine ads. The ruthlessness of gifted youth is missing and dont look to Efron to pick it up. (He has trouble even staying in period; when Richard sings he sounds like a breathy Disney Radio star.)What McKay gets right is the voice that resonant basso profundo with the devil deep inside it. The finest funniest scene in ""Me and Orson Welles may be when Orson drags Richard along to one of the many live radio dramas he acted in to keep the Mercury afloat and bamboozles the other players by improvising a speech lifted from ""Ambersons. Its the dexterity of Welless art and ego that McKay conveys - that and the joy of outfoxing everyone in the room.The movie builds to a very nice approximation of the November 11 1937 opening night of the Mercury ""Caesar - triumph pulled from the teeth of disaster - and then sputters to a warm but ordinary coming-of-age conclusion. Linklater may be one of our best working moviemakers but a conventionally structured period film isnt the best showcase for his talents. He likes entropy too much the chaos of creation and colliding personalities.Dont go to ""Me and Orson Welles then expecting an epic re-creation of prewar New York. What we get is a few good blocks and the beautiful charlatans who worked there and thats more than enough for some of us.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Dec. 10 2009 1252PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Me and Orson Welles Directed by Richard Linklater Written by Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo Starring Christian McKay Zac Efron and Claire Danes Classification PG Before he created the grand radio stunt War of the Worlds before he made Citizen Kane the 1941 film still regarded by many as the pinnacle of motion-picture achievement a 22-year-old Orson Welles was a theatre genius. He made his triumphant Broadway debut in 1937 with a bare bones heavily edited modern dress ""black shirt"" production of Julius Caesar . The show echoing the rise of totalitarian regimes in Italy and Germany was a hit and Welless Mercury Theatre was launched. Me and Orson Welles blends fictional and historic characters in chronicling that theatre milestone from the perspective of a New York high-school senior Richard (Zac Efron) who gets the role of Lucius the lute-playing servant to Brutus in the frantic week before the plays opening. The job promises neither money nor glory simply a chance to be at the birth of a cultural event. ""Youre not getting anything except the opportunity to be sprayed by Orsons spit"" Welless assistant Sonja (Claire Danes) warns him. Me and Orson Welles (adapted by Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo from a youth novel by high-school English teacher Robert Kaplow) shouldnt be as entertaining as it is. Efron is too much a confident Disney heartthrob to suggest the nervous awe his character is supposed to feel. Also it looks like a cable television production. Richard Linklater ( Before Sunrise  Dazed and Confused ) makes no attempt at evoking New York in the thirties (it was shot in London and the Isle of Man) and theres no attempt to simulate Welless baroque film style. Fortunately Me and Orson Welles has a great thundering ace up its sleeve - the character of Orson Welles. Hes reincarnated here by British stage actor Christian McKay who played Welles in the off-Broadway one-man show Rosebud The Lives of Orson Welles . McKay has Welless baritone down to a juicy rumble. His twinkle his pomposity his patronizing manner are captured to perfection. (If the 36-year-old McKay looks old for 22 so did Welles.) There are moments when you see McKay jumping in and out of the role of Brutus (treated highly sympathetically) and ordering his cast about when you feel as if you had stumbled onto some remarkable found documentary of Welles in action. The other achievement is a smartly crafted story a memorable coming-of-age tale as young Richard gets a crash course both in art and treachery. Welles is portrayed as a horror to work for pompous dishonest irascible and petty. He juggles a pregnant wife and several mistresses while running roughshod over his casts feelings in the service of his changing vision. Like Richard Daness Sonja is a fictional character a stylish Vassar grad with career ambitions who serves as Richards and our entree into this backstage family. We meet the Welles ensemble the much put-upon manager John Houseman (who had a secondary career as an actor in the seventies and eighties in the movie and television series The Paper Chase ); the skirt-chasing Joseph Cotten (James Tupper); and the neurotic gifted George Coulouris (Ben Chaplin) who plays Marc Antony. The very name Orson Welles stands for genius wasted and betrayed and the movie offers some foreshadowing of his triumphs and failures to come. Welles takes Richard along to a radio taping for a little lesson in acting and on the way shows him his marked-up copy of The Magnificent Ambersons (his other 1941 masterpiece) which he describes in a vulnerable moment as being ""about how everything gets taken away from you."" But the film is about Welles cresting toward his greatest triumphs. He breezes through the radio drama on fierce energy and panache without bothering to learn the lines. Best of all we see enough scenes of Welless staging of Julius Caesar to suggest how the stark violence and minimalist presentation had such an immediate impact. Me and Orson Welles is book-ended with another love story of Richards fledgling romance with a young fiction writer (Zoe Kazan) which is endearing if dispensable. Powerful art as Welles demonstrated is anything but endearing.

(Liam Daniel/cinemanx Films One) Enlarge Photo Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 11 2009 ""Me and Orson Welles"" is a love story but not the kind you would think. This StoryMe and Orson Welles Stage presence A drama king rules this comedyMe and Orson Welles Zac Efron looking for a curveball to swing atTrailer Me and Orson Welles The title notwithstanding this gently charming comedy has nothing to do with any romance between the late actor-director-genius and anyone other than himself. As portrayed by Christian McKay -- who has the wunderkinds arrogant bearing sonorous voice and giant ego down cold -- Welles is too self-absorbed to care about anything other than his art. And that includes his very pregnant wife (Emily Allen) whom he neglects in favor of any woman in the cast wholl have him. McKays Welles is a man of outsize appetites -- sexual gustatory and artistic -- and the actors performance is hugely satisfying. Set over the course of a single week in November 1937 ""Me and Orson Welles"" by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Richard Linklater (""Before Sunset"") is based on Robert Kaplows historical novel of the same name about Welless Mercury Theatre and its acclaimed modern-dress production of Shakespeares ""Julius Caesar."" Told through the eyes of 17-year-old Richard Samuels (Zac Efron) an aspiring actor who stumbles into a bit part in the play the movie does involve a traditional boy-meets-girl subplot No sooner has Richard arrived than hes making goo-goo eyes with Sonja (Claire Danes) an older worldly wise production assistant. And shes making them right back. It doesnt ruin things to know that first Richard gets lucky then gets his heart broken. Richard and Sonjas destiny turns this into a somewhat predictable coming-of-age story. But thats not the real love story Im talking about either. Rather ""Me and Orson Welles"" is a movie in love with live theater. And not just with the finished product either though Linklater lavishes much screen time near the end of the film showing how and why Welless adaptation would have wowed audiences at the time. ""Orson Welles"" is head over heels sometimes even giddily in love with the magic the risk and the drama (both on stage and off) that go into putting on a show. Its ""Glee"" for the literary set. When Richard is cast for instance -- based on little other than his ability to sing -- the play is still in a shambles. Its director Welles is habitually late for rehearsal. Music cues are being changed every day. Roles are being cut and then restored right and left and everybody is trying to get into everybody elses pants or having a nervous breakdown. As anyone who has ever worked on a play knows thats pretty typical. Its also pretty esoteric stuff. Its an open question as to who outside theater geeks will find this inside-baseball approach quite as fascinating as Linklater apparently does. That said theres much to recommend ""Orson Welles"" to the general population. Or at least the part of it that loved ""Bullets Over Broadway."" In addition to McKay Danes makes a sassy sexy Sonja. And Efron more than gets by in his role as the sweet plucky starstruck newbie. Its a part that doesnt require much heavy lifting though. In fact I would have liked to see more interaction between Richard and Gretta Adler an aspiring writer Richard meets in a sheet-music shop and who keeps popping up in the kind of New York City serendipity you see only in movies. Played by Zoe Kazan the granddaughter of the great director Elia Kazan Gretta is one of many small delights here. As for getting that wreck of a play into shape with only one week to go before opening night? It may sound like another cliche but as any theater geek will tell you Its true. A lot can happen in seven days. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Stage presence A drama king rules this comedy Zac Efron looking for a curveball to swing at Trailer Me and Orson Welles",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/10/AR2009121001275.html,200,meandorsonwelles4,meandorsonwelles,washingtonpost

Media San Francisco Chronicle Me and Orson Welles Drama. Starring Zac Efron Christian McKay and Claire Danes. Directed by Richard Linklater. (PG-13. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When actors play real people viewers usually have to make a mental adjustment. The actor is clearly not that actual person but after a few minutes its possible to get onto the actors wavelength and enter into the fantasy. But nothing like that process happens with regard to Christian McKay who as Orson Welles in ""Me and Orson Welles"" gives what I believe is the most exact and uncanny screen portrayal of an historical figure ever. McKay realizes Welles in all his modes - the booming intimidating Welles. The tasting-his-words and twinkling-with-his-own-brilliance Welles. The grand and moving actor Welles. The playful storytelling Welles. And of course the relaxed and genial Welles who was almost completely relaxed and genial but for a touch of ""Here I am being genial and I am better at geniality than any man who has walked the earth"" Moreover McKay is able to switch between Welles various modes on a dime. In his first scene he meets the ""Me"" of the title - Richard (Zac Efron) a teenager who wants to work with Welles Mercury Players. They stand outside the theater and in between barking orders at subordinates and showing off Welles sizes up the kids character and auditions him. That scene alone is an astonishing tour de force and McKays performance never drops below that level. I forgot that I was looking at an actor. I really believed I was looking at Welles. As for the film its a total charmer about the run-up to Welles 1937 production of ""Julius Caesar"" full of loving period detail. Richard Linklater directs the movie with his characteristic feeling for the nuances and particulars of human interaction and sensitivity toward youthful coming of age. Its a wonderful thing for Efron at this stage of his career to find himself working with Linklater. Efrons earlier movie ""17 Again"" had moments suggesting that this kid was more than a pretty face. In ""Me and Orson Welles"" he gets to prove it. Efron is the ambitious young man of 1930s lore the Depression kid from New Yorks outer boroughs who by some accident of nature has deep artistic longings. Efron leaves us with no doubt that working with Welles represents for this young man the absolute pinnacle but at the same time he gives young Richard a tough streak that will serve him well if he hopes to survive in showbiz. Efrons good looks help too conveying a youthful purity and also explaining why the companys production assistant (Claire Danes) takes an instant interest in him. In 30s costume Efron looks a lot like Tyrone Power. ""Me and Orson Welles"" is the story of a young mans education into the ways of artists and the theater and men and women. The theater scenes are satisfying - the re-creation of Welles stage production feel authentic - but so are the quiet two-person scenes. The movie goes a lot deeper than nostalgia and offers more than McKays performance amazing though that may be. On a side note I wonder if were going to see a replay of 1991 at the Academy Awards on Feb. 22. That year Joe Pesci in ""Goodfellas"" beat Bruce Davison in ""Longtime Companion"" for best supporting actor and it was a shame that both couldnt win. This year we have Christoph Waltz in ""Inglourious Basterds"" and McKay and either would be a sure thing ... if it werent for the other. Advisory This film contains sexual situations and lewd talk.

"Me and Orson Welles Co-star dominates Zac Efron | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMe and Orson Welles Co-star dominates Zac EfronNever has a ""me"" seemed more superfluous in a title than it does in Me and Orson Welles  a Richard Linklater movie that creates stardom by accident.Christian McKay plays showbiz giant Orson Welles with the bombast he deserves leaving Zac Efron little room to shine as the big mans gofer.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 11 2009 Starring Zac Efron Claire Danes and Christian McKay. Directed by Richard Linklater. 107 minutes. At the Varsity. PG Never has a ""me"" seemed more superfluous in a title than it does in Me and Orson Welles a Richard Linklater movie that creates stardom by accident.The ""me"" refers to Zac Efron who is looking to break out of his High School Musical box with a more dramatic role. He doesnt succeed but the other half of the title and the entire movie belongs to Christian McKay an unknown Briton who renders unto Welles what the showbiz giant truly deserves.Article Continued BelowSteady critical acclaim for McKays wry take on Welles accounts for why this small picture is opening now having languished on the shelf since its premiere at TIFF 08. McKay powers his way into being a credible candidate for a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the next Academy Awards.The movies initial emphasis is on Efron who has only youth in his favour in the role of Richard Samuels a teen aspirant to the Broadway stage. Its November 1937 and Richard is on a train heading into Manhattan staring at a photo of John Gielgud and imagining himself in the shoes of the great actor.He soon finds himself in front of the Mercury Theatre where Welles a wunderkind at 22 thanks to his mounting of an audacious black version of Macbeth is planning another cultural coup. He wants to set the Bards Julius Caesar in the fascist Italy of World War II.Welles takes an immediate shine to Richard who joins the Mercury troupe as a combination gofer bit actor (hell play Lucius) and Welles protege. But the easily distracted Welles spends more time chasing skirts and arguing with producers than giving direction leaving Richard ample time to chat up the directors assistant Sonja (Claire Danes).Richard doesnt really know what he wants to do with a woman and Sonja isnt all that interested in a lad about 10 years her junior. This is no impediment to sex but romance might be another matter. Danes adroitly manages to make her characters flexible morality seem more liberated than loose. Efron just seems adrift.Working with the fact-based eponymous novel by Robert Kaplow first-time screenwriters Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo are content to follow the contours of a standard behind-the-scenes story about the staging of a play.The same can be said of director Linklater who normally goes in for edgier material. Hes content here just to reproduce the look and sound of a bygone era and to present one memorable character.Linklaters instincts are shrewd and spot-on in the casting of McKay who is not only a ringer for Welles but also a fabulous interpreter of his baritone bossiness. The actor elevates the so-so script with mirthful depiction of Welles as a man of such outrageous narcissism he orders his staff to summon ambulances to convey him through New York because taxis arent fast enough. On the rare occasion when Welles says ""thank you"" to a member of his beleaguered troupe he has to whisper it because the sound might hurt his ears.The ambulance story sounds apocryphal. But given that the events of the film occur less than a year before Welles terrified America with his War of the Worlds radio hoax and four years before he revolutionized cinema with Citizen Kane you can believe anything about the man.Related story Clare Danes reflects on the influence of Orson Welles The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Me and Orson Welles"" is a little velvet sack of diamonds. Its a sparkling love letter to a gigantic talent a romance a comedy a drama. Above all its a tale of puberty the period between childhood and adulthood for both of its title characters and for America. The story is retro but the subject matter is familiar to indie director Richard Linklater (""Dazed and Confused"" ""School of Rock"" and ""Before Sunset""). The film is set in 1937 as Welles the boy wonder of radio plays and theater prepares to stage ""Julius Caesar."" Zac Efron a 17-year-old actor bored to extinction with his high school drama class plays hooky in Manhattan meets the showman on the street and lands a bit part. On the radio theres news of war brewing in Europe and Welles intends to make ""Caesar"" a revolutionary modern-dress commentary on fascism. The troupes producer frets about deadlines and funding the cast and orchestra are frustrated by Welles constant revisions. But as opening night approaches the crises energize everyone. With Welles as the whip-cracking ringmaster they work together in euphoric harmony. The strongest source of tension is offstage where the actors actresses and office staff are performing a bedroom farce of their own. Claire Danes plays a secretary for the company whose intelligence loyalty and cool elegance make her the perfect employee for the chaotic Mercury Theater. Efron courts her with the helplessness of a young man who believes he is in love but knows nothing of the practical side of courtships. Welles a world-class philanderer can go from an introduction to a smoothly executed pickup in under a minute. Hes a man in a hurry after all traveling across Manhattan in an ambulance to beat the traffic. Linklater directs with a wonderful lightness of touch. He doesnt labor over introducing the big cast of characters. We learn their identities and their place in the hierarchy as we go along. Cameraman Bill Pope shoots clear strong images free from any hokey patina of age. The script is literate and restrained a neatly arranged composition of wry humor and melancholy. Efron takes a step here from pinup status to actor but the real story is Christian McKay a British stage actor who has played Welles for years in one-man shows. His film debut is a triumph. At 36 hes a bit old; Welles was a wunderkind of 22 when he set New York on its ear with ""Caesar."" Nevertheless McKay strongly resembles the young Welles and brilliantly captures the measure of the man. He sees everyone as an audience to be seduced or taken by force. When he focuses on someone its as if the rotating lamp of a lighthouse has paused to shine on that person alone. McKay understands the rebellious wounded orphan behind the emotionally isolated genius; Welles two great films ""Citizen Kane"" and ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" are about celebrated men trying to recapture the hope safety and security of their childhoods. From the cadences of that hypnotic voice to the lightning bolts of inspiration to the frequent look of a schoolboy pulling a naughty prank McKay nails his performance to the back wall of the theater. ME AND ORSON WELLES  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for sexual references and smoking. Where Lagoon. It helps to know something about history and Welless career to get the most from this film. When ""Caesar"" slays em McKay crows ""How will I top this?"" With the ""War of the Worlds"" broadcast and ""Kane"" just over the horizon its a great inside joke for culture vultures. And when Efron walks off into what looks like a happy ending it helps to remember how soon that faraway war on the radio would hit home.

It is 1937 Citizen Kane is not yet a gleam in Welles eye but the man is clearly a genius.At least as far as hes concerned.The ""me"" in Richard Linklaters terrifically fun spirited reimagining of Welles early creative days is Richard Samuels (Zac Efron) a high schooler (of course) who loves the theater and who by luck pluck and the lie that he can play banjo lands a small role in the Mercurys production of Julius Caesar. Such is the premise of Robert Kaplows novel that a teenager tumbles into this historic moment among this gang of legendary thespians (John Houseman Joseph Cotten Norman Lloyd) and experiences the head-spinning juggernaut first-hand - a hatchlings-eye-view.A love letter to the world of theater - to its tyrants and tyros to the set-builders costumers stars and scribes - Linklaters film adaptation succeeds in bringing the flamboyant Welles to life without resorting to caricature (although a few vintage Al Hirschfelds adorn the walls). This is due in no small part to McKay an English actor who has portrayed Welles in a one-man show but whose affinity for his subject goes deeper and broader than mere mimicry. His is in short an exhilarating performance.As the wet-behind-the-ears Richard accompanies Welles around town (he prefers ambulance over taxi its quicker) the boy sees the man at his best and worst radically repurposing Shakespeare to serve as allegory for fascisms rise; cheating on his pregnant wife with his leading lady - and with the front office girl too.That would be Claire Danes playing the sage seductive Sonja Jones. And Welles isnt the only one with his eye on her. Me and Orson Welles is on one level a coming-of-age tale and lucky Richard gets to come of age in the charming company of the self-possessed Miss Jones.As for Efron the High School Musical star acquits himself well in such stellar company. He too looks as if hes enjoying himself immensely.Linklaters filmography runs from indie minimalism (Slacker Before Sunrise) to experimental animation (Waking Life A Scanner Darkly) to straightforward Hollywood entertainments (School of Rock Bad News Bears). Me and Orson Welles is something else unabashedly old-fashioned in mood and manner its a retro period piece that lives comfortably within its own theatrical confines. No ones going to mistake Linklaters 1930s New York for the real thing (in fact the movie was shot on soundstages on the Isle of Man) but the place it evokes is one thats satisfyingly familiar in its art and its artifice.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Richard Linklaters film version of the Robert Kaplow novel tells a fairy tale based in fact. Strolling the Manhattan theater district one day in 1937 the storys fictional protagonist a New Jersey high school student played by Zac Efron stumbles into Orson Welles John Houseman and their Mercury Theatre associates. In an eye-blink young Richard is hired to play the lute-strumming role of Lucius in Welles modern-dress revival of ""Julius Caesar"" opening in a mere week. A week later Richard is not the same person. His eyes have been opened. And he is eager for more.These were history-making times for Welles. Already in 1937 the impresarios involvement with the incendiary musical ""The Cradle Will Rock"" (Tim Robbins made a rather hectoring film about it) burnished the Wellesian reputation for nerve and publicity. Welles ""Julius Caesar"" set in modern dress and drawing eerie parallels with Mussolinis regime featured actors Welles would use later in Hollywood ranging from panicky Brit George Coulouris (played in Linklaters film by Ben Chaplin) to elegant Virginia horn-dog Joseph Cotten (James Tupper). ""Me and Orson Welles"" has Richard falling for the Mercurys jill-of-all-trades Sonja played by Claire Danes. Her character is neither a simple ingenue nor a vamp. Danes reliably excellent creates a woman of ambition as well as heart.The films press so far has focused on Christian McKays portrayal of Welles and it is indeed something to see. Even more so to hear McKay (who is British and a fair bit older than was 22-year-old Welles in 1937) gives us a boy-man who practically since birth has been told he is a genius with a fantastically expressive voice and who uses that voice for theatrical effect even when hes nowhere near a stage. The script by Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo stays true to novelist Kaplows source material setting Welles up as the maelstrom who wises up a teenager and then whirls onward.Much of the film was shot on the Isle of Man with bits of London filling in for Depression-era Manhattan. Not since Mike Leighs Gilbert and Sullivan portrait ""Topsy-Turvy"" (1999) detailing the birth of ""The Mikado"" has a film devoted so much screen time to the ins and outs of theatrical endeavor so rewardingly. (Cinematographer Dick Pope a master at evocative interior lighting worked on both pictures.) This theatrical bent may be surprising given director Linklaters resume; then again the resume in question is one of the most unpredictable in contemporary American cinema zigzagging from the hazy Texas ambience of ""Slacker"" and ""Dazed and Confused"" to the quiet piquant marvels ""Before Sunrise"" and ""Before Sunset"" to ""The School of Rock"" and ""Fast Food Nation."" Working on a modest budget Linklater manages some lovely visual flourishes my favorite being a tracking shot that scurries puppy-like after Welles as he rushes from theatrical rehearsal to a radio gig at CBS. This isnt a bravura strolling-into-the-Copa-in-""GoodFellas"" example of the single take. Rather its unostentatiously interesting---controlled chaos crystallizing the chaos as lived and generated by Welles. MPAA rating PG-13 (for some sexual references and smoking)Cast Zac Efron (Richard Samuels); Claire Danes (Sonja Jones); Christian McKay (Orson Welles); Ben Chaplin (George Coulouris); Zoe Kazan (Gretta Adler); Eddie Marsan (John Houseman); James Tupper (Joseph Cotten); Kelly Reilly (Muriel Brassler).

A Freestyle Releasing release. Running time 153. Posted at 103855 AM in Reviews Comments McKay is great and I loved the depiction of Welless production of Julius Caesar. At that point you understood Welles not merely as a tyrant and glib performer but as a serious artist with an exciting modern vision. But sheesh Zac Efrons performance spared any comment in this review is pretty awful. Hes a real lump up there. He resembled more a sullen teenager than a young man caught up in an eye-opening life-changing experience. He cant act or even read lines or deliver jokes. I saw this as a major problem -- hes the lead character. I dont have anything against Efron otherwise. I didnt even know that thats who this guy was when I was watching it. (I had only heard the name and hadnt put it to a face.) But he didnt cut it here not by a long shot. p.s. If you cant find the movie at the usual places try metromix.com where you can look up the movie and see where its playing. Or you could just make sure its not at Webster Place.... Posted by JakeH | December 16 2009 at 1116 AM Will this movie actually be showing anywhere in Chicago? MP RESPONDS Hey there. Its at a measly two theaters Webster Place in Chicago and Renaissance Place in Highland Park. Seek and ye shall find a charmer. Posted by BrianG | December 12 2009 at 1126 AM So heres an excellent review of a movie Id really like to see... and it doesnt seem to be playing anywhere in this entire allegedly sophisticated multi-million-person metropolitan area.

Its 1937 and Richard is a mildly cocky slightly vain youngster who compares himself to a photo of John Gielgud on a book cover and tells a girl he meets in a jazz store that Im sort of an actor. Minutes later he stumbles on some real actors  gathered to rehearse Orson Welless Mercury Theatre production of Julius Caesar and lays down some chat about playing the ukulele. Next thing hes got a bit part. Weekly pay zilch. Kids got balls mutters Welles (Christian McKay) a cigar between his teeth. Let rehearsals begin...Robert Kaplows source novel and Linklaters sprightly adaptation sprinkle a little fiction on Welless very real radical staging of Julius Caesar and offer a sideways view of one of the most precocious flawed talents of the twentieth century. In 1937 Welles was just 22 pre-War of the Worlds pre-Citizen Kane but already a darling of the New York theatre scene and able to wrest art from chaos on a wing and a prayer. Efrons Richard - played with an attractive puckish energy and loosely based on a real character - is a window on Welless world at just enough of a distance from the great man that the directors loud personality doesnt dominate. All roads lead  to Welles but we also witness a brief affair between Richard and Mercury staffer Sonja Jones (Claire Danes) during which Richard learns that the public and the private are one and the same in this theatrical hothouse. Even the loss of his virginity infringes on Welless mantra There is one simple rule I own the storeMcKays turn as Welles is hugely enjoyable the right mix of extreme confidence and a dash of vulnerability. Physically and vocally hes very convincing his Welles is a bullish presence among his actors but he also displays cracks in the great mans armour he whispers a sincere thank you to his producer (Eddie Marsan) and tells Richard how hes adapting The Magnificent Ambersons for radio ""Ambersons"" is about how everything gets taken away from you he says a reminder that Welles lost both parents by the time he was 15. Whats most admirable about Linklaters production is that it never loses sight of the play at its heart. The crescendo is not a romance or any other distraction but the outcome of rehearsals during which we and the cast believe a disaster is pending. Theres a strong ensemble flavour characterised by the simultaneously selfish and clubbable tendencies of the actors which makes for a lightly comic experience but also for a portrait of a theatre company that feels warm and true.

If the biographical detail in this film is accurate we are asked to accept that` being a genius `and `being an amoral shit` are part and parcel of the Orson Welles persona. Christian McKay s Orson Welles so convincing that I forgot that the egotistical bastard on the screen is just an interpretation. Zac Efrons character Richard is extremely sympathetic and it is through his eyes that we see the vanity and the spiritual emptiness which is at the heart of the technically proficient and charismatic Welles character. Ive always wondered why a dull unappealing film like Citizen Kane is revered by film critics. so many critics . .. . . This film has helped me understand why . .. .

When Walter Kerr made that savage assessment in 1951 Welles was only 36. But he had already begun the task of his middle and later years struggling to produce more work let alone work equal to Citizen Kane and the other youthful triumphs that made him a legend at 25. (Article continued below...)Welless death in 1985 didnt rescue his reputation. ""For the television generation"" wrote frequent lunch companion Gore Vidal in 1989 ""he is remembered as an enormously fat and garrulous man with a booming voice seen most often on talk shows and in commercials where he somberly assured us that a certain wine would not be sold before its time whatever that meant."" In 1993 the critic Jonathan Rosenbaum one of Welless most perceptive chroniclers and staunchest defenders lamented that he is ""mainly regarded in the U.S. today as a failed artist."" Even now YouTube serves as a repository of Welless bad late-life behavior like the gruesome clips that keep ""Orson Welles drunk"" and ""Orson Welles frozen peas"" among his most popular Google searches. (Look them up for yourself if youre cruel.)But in the past decade or so there has been a slow contrary shift in how we remember Welles. The turn of the century brought a spate of 100-greatest-film lists which frequently ranked Citizen Kanefirst. In 1998 a restored version of his noir classic Touch of Evilproved that he could deliver a popular hit after all. Chris Welles Feders newly published memoir of her father is only the latest of the 50-plus books about him since his death biographies critical studies and more. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Its not just the critics and the snobs who are revising the way we think of him. Since his death depictions of Welles have turned up in novels plays television cartoons and remarkably often on the big screen. Now thanks to Richard Linklaters charming new film Me and Orson Welles he is about to enjoy his greatest posthumous visibility yet. The movie adapted from Robert Kaplows novel tells the story of a kid who stumbles into Welless revelatory modern-dress Julius Caesar which up-ended Broadway in 1937. This side of Welles has been depicted too often lately to be a fluke. Critics artists and audiences in the 21st century are reaching for an image of Orson thats not much like the one that prevailed when he died. But what is it? And why?Its no mystery why so many biographers have wanted to write about Welles since his death who can resist a life story that starts out as a tall tale and ends as a cautionary one? From the time he left the cradle (more or less) Welles flashed a bold imagination an impatience with convention and a consuming love of gee-whiz effects that let him knock over art forms like bowling pins theater (a voodoo Macbeth the modern Julius Caesar) radio (a seven-part Les Miserables the panic-inducing War of the Worlds) and film (Citizen Kane). But while he was completing The Magnificent Ambersons the follow-up to Kane Hollywood shut him out. This heartbreakingly lovely film about a bygone America was recut and butchered while its director was off doing his patriotic duty shooting a documentary in Brazil. ""They wrecked Ambersons"" Welles said later ""and the picture wrecked me."" He would make more quality films (F for Fake Chimes at Midnight) and enjoy some jolly gigs (playing Harry Lime in The Third Man) but after 1942 he spent too much time pleading with investors gaining weight and hawking wine--all the while turning into the degraded celebrity of Vidals description.To some of his biographers Welless descent makes him the poster boy for a broken culture that grinds up even its geniuses. The less forgiving call him the author of his own demise an irresponsible prima donna who largely got what he deserved. Much as I adore his work Ive tended toward the latter view. Its hard to rush to the defense of an artist who spent plenty of time on his Brazil trip partying with the natives and who insisted even in the reduced circumstances of his later years on staying in world-class hotels.Yet reading his eldest daughters new memoir In My Fathers Shadow makes it more difficult to take such a harsh view. Feder doesnt sugarcoat him as she traces their relationship from the days when he was still a Hollywood darling (and Mr. Rita Hayworth) to the very end (shuttling around Europe disappearing for years at a time). Again and again she asked for the most basic love and attention and Welles often failed to provide them. ""Orson is a genius Chrissie"" said her mother after he once again neglected to show ""and you cant expect a genius to behave like an ordinary father.""The book isnt always felicitously written but its poignant. Feder comes to understand that Orson is a ""child-man"" one who is in some ways younger than she is yet faced with impossibly grown-up choices. ""I have to keep my name alive and my bills paid"" he said of his many demeaning TV appearances. Feders story suggests that sitting in stern judgment of Welles isnt quite right nor is whistling past his failings as an artist and a man. If we understand his plight we ought to afford him some pity the way she did in time.Even as Welless chroniclers offer this richer portrait of the older (if not more mature) figure the public seems to be seizing on a different persona. Me and Orson Welles doesnt serve up the compromised struggling artist of Welless late (or even middle) years. We see instead the dynamic young tyro the world-beating talent who hired an ambulance so he could get from the theater to the radio studio in time to broadcast his gigs. (True story.) As young Richard (Zac Efron) comes to adore and ultimately run afoul of the director who whimsically hired him the film shows why Orson became a legend. Welles (played not half badly by Christian McKay) is forever blasting onto the screen shaking things up making things happen. He brooks no dissent. ""Every single one of you stands here as an adjunct to my vision"" he booms to the company. ""I own the store."" Its not always pretty Welles comes off as an imperious duplicitous philandering brat. But hes also funny seductive and ingenious. Toward the end Linklater devotes seven luxurious minutes to a re-creation of Welless Caesar. Many of its novelties--contemporary dress stark lighting spare set--have become de rigueur but its transfixing all the same.Though the old fat Welles has popped back into view a few times--as in Austin Pendletons play Orsons Shadow about his return to the stage in the 1960s--a reader or moviegoer getting his first look at Orson lately has been far more likely to meet a vibrant dynamo like Linklaters. Theres been Cradle Will Rock (in which a cartoonishly madcap young Welles stages a politically charged opera) RKO 281 (the bold young Orson takes on the brutish William Randolph Hearst) Man in the Chair (Welles in flashback on the set of Kane confers a nickname and spirit of independence on a young gaffer) and even The Simpsons which offered a Halloween homage to The War of the Worlds. (When Welless broadcast about a fake alien invasion is followed by an actual alien invasion young Orson pleads with the residents of Springfield to alert the authorities but Chief Wiggum tells the military only that theyve been invaded by ""a pompous radio ham"" with apocalyptic results.)These depictions of young larger-than-life Orson have been so frequent that we can compare interpretations. Who comes closest to the broad frame and baby face? Probably McKay though he lacks what a friend of Welless called ""a certain lunatic radiance."" (Plus like every other actor whos played Welles since his death hes too old for the part.) Whos nearest to mimicking the rumbling bass voice that was ever so slightly sibilant that could pivot in a syllable from wry to grave? Maurice LaMarche who played him in The Simpsons and (while overdubbing Vincent DOnofrio) Ed Wood but even he cant match the essential Welles tone a voice monumentally delighted with the sound of itself.As the people who heard that voice firsthand leave us and the depictions of his bright youth proliferate Welless fortunes seem to be reversing hes less and less a punchline and more and more an icon. A select few stars become these fixed points of reference in our culture. Theyre the ones who dont just entertain us they reflect back to us some vital aspect of ourselves. Just as the Great Bambino personifies the swing-from-the-heels excess of the roaring 20s and Ol Blue Eyes embodies the swagger of midcentury cool Welles seems to be standing in for a kind of American artist un-limited. Theres a risk of being too sociological about this but you can see how the Boy Wonder serves a need at a difficult time America is in bad shape and the culture that Welles lit up is changing all around us. Why wouldnt we be drawn to the kid from Wisconsin who brashly pushed back the limits of the possible?This could all change of course. A biopic starring Jack Black in a gray wig would suffice to turn the tide. And iconhood has a downside it leads to a certain thinning in how youre remembered. Artists who become icons risk having their work overshadowed by their image becoming mere personalities. Still it beats being an outcast something Orson predicted he wouldnt remain for long. ""They may turn their backs on me now but you wait and see darling girl"" he told Chris in one of their last conversations.

The planet has gone cold after an unexplained apocalypse that killed the flora the fauna and most of the spectrum (though the sickly light from a blighted sun does manage to produce one wan rainbow). Not that many people populate the film--mainly a father and son slogging across a slag-heap American landscape and subsisting on what shreds of food they can find while trying not to become protein for other survivors whove descended into cannibalism. Normally you give yourself to a movie suspending disbelief. In this one you hang on to yourself for dear life resisting belief as best you can in the face of powerful acting persuasive filmmaking and the perversely compelling certainty that nothing will turn out all right. Watch a scene from ""The Road."" Adapted from the novel by Cormac McCarthy the film follows a man (Viggo Mortensen) and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) as they wander the highways of post-apocalyptic America. Video courtesy of The Weinstein Company. The man played by Viggo Mortensen doesnt have a name because Cormac McCarthys novel didnt give him one. Mr. Mortensen gives him a gaunt grandeur--it doesnt hurt that the actors face can evoke paintings of Christ without a muscle being moved--and an emotional spectrum that is muted but remarkably wide considering the characters plight and the authors spare style. The mans young son terrified by a cataclysm he cant comprehend but still capable of sweet optimism and kindness is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee. Between the two performances theres not a false note. Between the father and son theres an unbreakable bond. Though civilization has ended love and parental duty shape the course of this fable which is otherwise as heartwarming as a Beckett play shorn of humor. Hollywoods Favorite Cowboy Author Cormac McCarthy talks about the movie based on his novel ""The Road."" ""Whatever it takes"" is the mans mantra--whatever it takes to survive to protect his son to teach the boy how to survive on his own. His parenting is reduced to elementals in a world reduced to savagery. Yet parents teach by example so the fable grows complex when a brief encounter with a starving old man presents an ethical dilemma--let him starve as the father wants to do or follow the boys impulse to give him food. (Robert Duvall finds fleeting poetry in the old mans attempt to talk about his own son.) This is not ""On the Beach"" suffused by a sense of regret and mournful surrender but its not exactly musical comedy; the ill winds are icy and incessant. The director John Hillcoat working from an adaptation by Joe Penhall severely rations our glimpses of life bathed in blessedly bright sunlight as it was before a piano duet played by two hands one large and one small; a portrait in jagged fragments of the wife and mother--shes played with eloquence and passion by Charlize Theron--who couldnt weather the worst of the storm. For the most part ""The Road"" is a strip mall of horrors relieved only by occasional interludes of better fortune during which the father and son find nourishment temporary safety or brief comfort. (Javier Aguirresarobe was the cinematographer. Nick Cave and Warren Ellis did the lovely music an unlikely combination of medieval and Appalachian.) ENLARGE Viggo Mortensen as a desperate father with Kodi Smit-McPhee as his beloved son in The Road. Dimension Films Will all of this bleakness find an audience? Maybe so. The theme of unswerving love is strong. The spectacle of a blasted planet holds a fateful attraction. A beautician who saw a preview told me how much shed been moved by a scene in which the man and boy find a way to wash their hair with warm water and shampoo and whos to say her perspective is skewed; at the very least the movie makes us grateful for the comforts we have. Still watching this production and reading the book are vastly different experiences. The book challenges the reader to find the feelings buried in the prose (after challenging the reader to stay with a story that first seems like a dogged exercise in finding different ways to express grim and gray). The conversations between the boy and man are so minimalist as to border on maddening yet theyre charged with suppressed emotion. For better or worse the book demands work and rewards it with an acute sense of existential dread. The movie being a movie bears inevitable resemblances to other postapocalyptic movies including those enlivened by crazed bikers or zombies. Yet ""The Road"" to its great credit hews closely to the books vision. And it spares us the culinary details of cannibalism--no small favor under the circumstances. Me and Orson Welles Richard Linklaters ""Me and Orson Welles"" a cheerfully fatuous coming of age comedy was adapted from a novel by Robert Kaplow. The setting is New York in 1937. Thats when the preposterously precocious Welles at the age of 22 was directing his Mercury Theater production of ""Julius Caesar"" a daring adaptation set in fascist Italy. Strictly speaking Welles isnt the movies central character; the Me of the ungrammatical title is Richard Samuels (Zac Efron) a high school student who inveigles Welles into casting him as the lute-playing Lucius. Still Welles is Welles. He was always at the center of everything and he certainly is here. Whats more hes played by an excellent English actor Christian McKay who bears or somehow simulates a facial resemblance to the great man and nails Welless expression of pouty aggrieved amusement. But Mr. McKay is in his mid-30s and doesnt conceal it so whats the point? By taking the kind out of wunderkind the movie also removes the wunder. ENLARGE Christian McKay at center as Orson Welles in Me and Orson Welles. CinemaNX Films One Limited For those who care less about Orson Welles and more about the heart-throbby Mr. Efron the point is clear put the young star of Disneys ""High School Musical"" (who just turned 22 himself) into a nostalgic period piece and give him a chance to develop his acting chops. But Mr. Efrons fix on the period suggests a GPS struggling in a low-signal area and the movie becomes an affectionate name-dropping exercise in historical mutilation. Among the members of the Mercury Theater John Houseman is played by Eddie Marsan Joseph Cotten is played by James Tupper and Norman Lloyd is played by Leo Bill. Mr. Lloyd who was born one year before Orson Welles is an irrepressible raconteur and an endlessly zestful observer of the movie scene. I dare not imagine what hell think of ""Me and Orson Welles."" Though no I dare. DVD FOCUS The Gleaners and I (2000) ENLARGE They arent the father and son of ""The Road"" living on scraps of food and the occasional banquet of canned goods but the scavengers recyclers and dumpster-divers in Agnes Vardas surprising documentary live off the land in their own fashion. Ms. Varda the influential director of such French-language features as ""Cleo From 5 to 7"" and ""Le Bonheur"" was inspired by Jean-Francois Millets 1857 painting Les Glaneuses. Her mission was to find contemporary equivalents of the three peasant women in the painting searching for grains of wheat in an already harvested field. In finding them she found herself. Mad Max (1979) ENLARGE At the age of 23 an American-born Aussie named Mel Gibson burst upon the world as the motorcycle cop Max Rockatansky in George Millers dazzling violent and endlessly influential postapocalyptic action fantasy. The dramatic engine is revenge. When a biker gang of lascivious psychopaths murders Maxs family--after all these years the sequence is still shocking--he goes after them with all the weapons and wiles at his command. The setting is Australias Outback where the chases like the roads seem limitless. David Eggby did the cinematography and the director worked from a script he wrote with James McCausland. School of Rock (2003) ENLARGE Richard Linklater previously known for such slacker comedies as ""Dazed and Confused"" and the genre-defining ""Slacker"" directed this joyous farce--from a script by Mike White--about a scruffy rocker passing himself off as a pedagogue and turning a bunch of rigid preteens into a rock band for the ages. The star is Jack Black whose anarchic musician is a monster of antic id a poster child for the bright side of sociopathy and a wailing dervish with a false falsetto and a mock-Mephistophelean mien.

Its quite a leap for Zac Efron from the ""High School Musical"" series to ""Me and Orson Welles"" a coming-of-age comedy set against the background of Orson Welles legendary fascist-themed 1937 stage production of ""Julius Caesar."" In truth this charming thankfully atypical film by Richard Linklater (""Before Sunrise"" and its even more soporific sequel) belongs not to Efron but to British actor Christian McKay who entertainingly dominates the proceedings as the young hammy genius Welles. The spare and foreshortened but powerful Shakespearean adaptation was the first production of the Mercury Theatre which Welles and John Houseman (Eddie Marsan effectively cast against type) founded after splitting with the Federal Theater following a battle over ""Cradle Will Rock."" ""Me and Orson Welles"" is in effect a sequel to Tim Robbins star-filled self-important film about ""Cradle"" but its far lighter on its feet. Efron is the audiences surrogate as a 17-year-old suburban lad who lands a small role in the production. He gets lucky with a production assistant (Claire Danes) but also has an eye for a younger writer played by Zoe Kazan (whose grandfather Elia was acting with the Group Theater at the same time). These actors are playing more-or-less fictional characters but pretty much everyone else is playing a real person and its especially fun if you know the actors they are playing. Ben Chaplin is the high-strung George Coulouris Welles Caesar; James Tupper (""Men in Trees"") cuts a dashing figure as future movie star Joseph Cotten; and Leo Bill is extremely funny as the still-extant Norman Lloyd future villain of Hitchocks ""Saboteur"" and still later Dr. Auschlander of ""St. Elsewhere."" There are romantic rivalries and backstage crises aplenty as opening night approaches and everyone (especially the long-suffering Houseman) gripes about the imperious Welles who tends to show up hours late for rehearsals. In the end though Welles delivers. The films final half-hour is devoted to a fairly meticulous re-creation of the groundbreaking show -- from original designs and Marc Blitzsteins score -- that fully demonstrates the genius that Welles would eventually bring to bear on his screen masterpiece ""Citizen Kane."" ""Me and Orson Welles"" mostly filmed on London soundstages and an old theater on Britains Isle of Man is one of the best pictures about the stage in recent memory.

Hoberman Richard Linklaters Orson Welles Puts on Quite a Show Tuesday November 24 2009 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Orson Welles and Zac Efron discuss Julius Caesar 3 Senior Year.Liam Daniel A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The most significant American artist before Andy Warhol to take ""the media"" as his medium Orson Welles lives on not only in posthumously restored directors cuts of his re-released movies but as a character in other peoples novels plays and movies--notably Richard Linklaters deft affectionate and unexpectedly enjoyable Me and Orson Welles.Like Tim Robbinss far less adroit Cradle Will Rock released exactly a decade ago Me and Orson Welles concerns a legendary Welles stage production namely his 1937 black-shirt version of Shakespeares Julius Caesar. This cut-and-paste anti-fascist spectacle--characterized in its original press material as the ""Death of a Dictator"" and in a frantic state of revision up until opening night--was the Mercury Theatres first Broadway show. It was also its 22-year-old directors personal triumph if more for his bravura use of lighting and bare-bones stagecraft to evoke the spectacle of mob rule than his distracted performance as the bumbling ""bourgeois intellectual"" Brutus.Adapted from a novel by high school English teacher Robert Kaplow Linklaters movie views Welless achievement from the perspective of a high school student (teenage heartthrob Zac Efron) slightly younger but scarcely less stage-struck or brash. Dubbed ""Junior"" by Welles (British actor Christian McKay) the lad brazens his way into a minor part as Brutuss lute-strumming page a week before the play is set to open. ""Youre not getting anything except the opportunity to be sprayed by Orsons spit"" Welless assistant (Claire Danes) good-naturedly warns him scarcely out of her teens and pleased to play the worldly older woman. Actually the callow but competent Junior gets away with quite a bit (up to a point) even as he learns something about performing and human nature--or at least about the nature of Orson Welles.So do we thanks to a rich--bordering on plummy--performance by McKay who previously inhabited this part in the Off-Broadway one-man show Rosebud The Lives of Orson Welles. His vocal impression of Welles is pitch-perfect and he nails Welless ironic twinkle and assured mocking self-importance. He portrays the shamelessly hammy hilariously patronizing craftily manipulative Welles learning how to play Welles--that his performance is clearly modeled on Welless own as the young Charles Foster Kane actually enriches Citizen Kane in retrospect. Me and Orson Welles doesnt lack for vivid turns--including Daness ambitious college girl Eddie Marsans distracted John Houseman James Tuppers affable Joseph Cotten and Ben Chaplins high-strung George Coulouris--but McKay naturally steals the show even as Welles steals Juniors girl.For all of its virtues Me and Orson is not perfect. The thrifty period mise-en-scene is oversaturated with 30s popular music (although not curiously the modernist-cabaret score Marc Blitzstein provided for the stage production) and the screenplay gives only a perfunctory sense of the eras Popular Front politics (Clifford Odetss Golden Boy opened on Broadway one week before). But percolating with backstage banter and behind-the-scenes maneuvering Me and Orson is a spirited confident and even edifying piece of work. Welles takes Junior along when he rushes off to do a radio play with the airy assurance that one can learn all that needs to be known about radio drama in an hour. (Actually it only takes 10 minutes--the length of this richly comic sequence.) Linklaters climactic opening night provides a similarly convincing precis of Welless production. Its easy to understand why despite drama critic George Jean Nathans celebrated dis (""Playing Julius Caesar in modern dress strikes me as being of a piece with playing Room Service in togas"") the production was a tremendous success.Would that Linklater had quit while he was ahead. Burdened by an unnecessary subplot featuring Zoe Kazans aspiring writer Me and Orson goes disconcertingly soft toward the end--throwing away the provocative notion that the entire episode might have been Juniors classroom daydream for a more conventional closer. This nod to naturalism is itself cancelled out by the sentimental addition of Orsons sotto voce ""thank you"" directed to the back of the long-suffering Houseman. This momentary deflation of the Welles ego is the least convincing moment in the film. Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact J.

(AP Photo/CinemaNX Films One Limited/Daniel) Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday November 25 2009 212 AM Title Me and Orson Welles"" will be known best as the film in which Zac Efron - the ""me"" in the movies name - took his first tentative steps beyond the teen market. But its the second half of the title that matters more.Surprisingly conventional by director Richard Linklaters standards this pleasant low-key dramedy is most memorable for the discovery of co-star Christian McKay. Technically though this is Efrons story or at least that of his character Richard. A wide-eyed student in 1937 all Richard really wants to do is act. And not in high school musicals mind you but on Broadway. He gets his chance when Welles (McKay) offhandedly casts him in a soon-to-be-famous staging of ""Julius Caesar."" As opening night approaches Richard faces an intimidating list of challenges from Welles unpredictable behavior to a growing crush on the elusive production assistant (Claire Danes). There are also run-ins with colleagues like Joseph Cotten (James Tupper) and John Houseman (Eddie Marsan) who resent his inexperience. The movie adapted from a historical novel by Robert Kaplow makes a point of its own theatricality. The New York we see looks like a set (much of the movie was shot in Great Britain). Large parts of the dialogue feel delivered rather than spoken and the actors portray characters like ambitious starlets or smooth ladies men that are more recognizable from film than real life. Zac Efron left and Claire Danes in Me and Orson Welles. Efron steps out of the teen market in this flick - but its especially notable for discovering Christian McKay (below) who plays Welles. (AP Photo/CinemaNX Films One Limited/Daniel) Likable as it is however there is little depth to this project which Linklater seems to consider a bit of a trifle. And that makes it the perfect choice for a heartthrob slowly inching toward a respected or at least respectable acting career. No one would have remembered Efrons performance if hed been an unknown but since its as amiably breezy as the film itself no ones likely to denounce it either. People will however continue talking about British newcomer McKay whose most notable experience has been portraying Welles onstage. Now that we know he can handle an impersonation of considerable complexity it will be interesting to see the characters hell create on his own.

And on the way home your parents start talking about Oscar nominations which they never did after High School Musical 3 and it turns out that they arent talking about Zac at all but Crazy Eyes? Wouldnt that be a major bummer? Unless that is youre more curious about Orson Welles than about the charming but still callow Zac Efron. In the new Richard Linklater film Me and Orson Welles a youthful Welles is brilliantly embodied by Christian McKay in one of those hey-whos-that? performances that tends to draw Oscar talk even if the film itself isnt much more than an extremely pleasant lark. It is set in 1937 when Welles was just 22 and his ego was better established than his career. His broadcast of H.G. Wells The War of the Worlds was a year away Citizen Kane four years. But already Welles was keeping multiple mistresses and holding an entire cast hostage to his whims. ""The principal occupation of the Mercury Theater is waiting for Orson"" explains the young John Houseman (Eddie Marsan). (See pictures of Zac Efrons career in film.) Based on Robert Kaplows young adult novel of the same name the story blends fictional characters with real ones. Efron plays a fictional one 17-year-old Richard Samuels a high school student who worships Noel Coward and who acts as our main conduit into Welles world. Welles plucks Richard off the street and gives him a small but crucial part in his version of Julius Caesar which truly was performed to great success -- in modern dress with a fascist theme -- at New Yorks Mercury Theater that fall. Spending a week in Welless orbit Richard learns how to light a match in the coolest possible way how to impress a girl and like Icarus he discovers what happens when you get too close to a star. He rubs elbows with plenty of real people who were fast becoming Welles loyalists like Houseman Joseph Cotton (James Tupper) George Coulouris (Ben Chaplin) and radio star Les Tremayne (Michael Brandon) as well as one fictional dream girl Sonja (Claire Danes) a Vassar grad who functions as the productions girl Friday and occasionally as Welles requires it geisha to the resident genius. (Watch an interview with Zac Efron.) McKays performance which marries physical resemblance to internal channeling -- hes practiced in this having written and performed a one-man show called Rosebud The Lives of Orson Welles -- is exceptional. But theres one insurmountable problem his age. Hes 36 and passing for Welles at 22 is more than a stretch especially when youre up against the worlds biggest teenybopper. When Orson and Richard are briefly positioned as romantic rivals for Sonja its ludicrous no matter how much charisma Efron exudes -- since our perception of him is as a man in his mid-30s based on McKays appearance it hardly seems like a legitimate context. Sonja is not as worldly as shed like us to believe -- shes all red lipstick and knowing looks -- but she and Richard still seem light-years apart in terms of maturity. It doesnt help the plots credibility that theres something slightly off about Danes -- her vivacity is a kettle threatening to boil over -- and that we along with Richard have already met his far better match a quirky aspiring writer (the adorable Zoe Kazan) who is his equal in unjaded excitement. Linklater (Dazed and Confused School of Rock) usually sticks to contemporary stories or ones set in the recent past. (An exception The Newton Boys a 1920s-set western was his least memorable film.) Nothing about Me and Orson Welles suggests a directorial affinity for period pieces. When a vintage ambulance pulls up to transport Welles around Manhattan you half expect the prop master to pop out and buff the hood with pride. But Linklaters great strength lies in showing how ""families"" form in unexpected places especially when its a question of putting on a show. Here were witnessing not only genius at work (watching rehearsals we might doubt this Julius Caesar but what we see of the opening night is electrifying; thats when you really thrill to McKays Welles) but also the way Richard falls in love with the idea of theatrical family. (See TIMEs holiday movie guide.) In one scene Richard is exploring backstage and we feel his pleasure in his insider status; hes puffed up from it. Then he lights a match to better examine graffiti left by someone who walked these boards in earlier days and inadvertently sets off the theaters sprinkler system dousing everything including Welles who is madder than a wet cat. It perfectly catches the mood of the theater as seductress one minute she wants you she makes you feel blessed another she reminds you what a buffoon you are to believe you belong here.

"Guess who upstages Me and Orson Welles? - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Guess who upstages Me and Orson Welles?The famed director as played by Christian McKay cant help but be larger than life even with Claire Danes and Zac Efron along for the ride.November 25 2009|By BETSY SHARKEY | Film Critic ""Me and Orson Welles"" is a frothy backstage pass courtesy of director Richard Linklater to the early days of the great director (that would be Welles) during a stint as the mercurial head of the Mercury Theater Company in 1937. Adapted from Robert Kaplows novel the ""Me"" is a teenager whose coming-of-age story unfolds during the staging of Welles groundbreaking reimagining of Shakespeares Julius Caesar as a 30s-era Fascist dictator. The teen in question is Richard Samuels played by ""High School Musical"" heartthrob Zac Efron a senior who slips out of class and into NYC only to get swept up in Welles retinue with a small part tossed his way as a bone. The films other key players are Claire Danes as the directors whip-smart assistant and sometime lover Sonja; Christian McKay as Welles who bears a striking resemblance to the man and has a good handle on his pretension and ambition; and Zoe Kazan as Gretta Adler an aspiring writer and the occasional object of young Richards affection when hes not mooning over Sonja. Richards problem is really Efrons problem too and thus the films (which may be why it stumbled around the festival circuit for nearly a year before finding a distributor). The character spends most of the movie trailing Welles around like a puppy only occasionally biting the hand that feeds him. The role was supposed to mark Efron as a grown-up actor and while hes pleasant enough he remains very much in the puppy-training phase with Danes and McKay holding on to most of the movies treats. Linklater always brings a great sense of place to his projects whether its ""School of Rocks"" classroom antics with Jack Black the stoner high school students of ""Dazed and Confused"" or Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke wandering Paris in 2004s ""Before Sunset."" Though the production team gives us a lovely re-creation of the New York theater district circa 1937 the filmmaker truly finds his footing inside the Mercury where the casting the staging and the catastrophes play out. But its the clashing egos as much as the brilliant theater that interests Linklater here. The script written by Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo has Welles moving through the theater troupe like a shark feeding on anyone who is weaker than he is which means everyone. Roles are expanded and contracted with abandon actors hired and fired lovers taken and discarded with a pregnant wife not treated much better. McKay a British stage actor who was doing an off-Broadway production about the movie legend when casting started and Danes whose acting always seems so effortlessly good are the best things about the film. But as in life the presence of Welles never fails to overtake things and McKays command of the subject is so Welles-ian that when hes in a scene everyone else fades a little. And neither the director (that would be Linklater) nor the film ever quite recover from that. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe man who was Orson WellesDecember 5 2009The Big PictureSeptember 16 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesTheaterReviewEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-orson25-2009nov25,0,2024898.story",200,meandorsonwelles19,meandorsonwelles,latimes

ABOUT THE MOVIEMe and Orson Welles  1/2 (out of four) StarsZac Efron Christian McKay Claire Danes Ben Chaplin Zoe Kazan Eddie MarsanDirectorRichard LinklaterDistributor Freestyle ReleasingRating PG-13 for sexual references and smokingRunning time 1 hour 54 minutes Opens Wednesday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Awkward syntax aside Me and Orson Welles would be a much better movie if the first part of the title were excised or at least scaled back. The story pertaining to Orson Welles (terrifically played by Christian McKay) is far more compelling than what happens to the young guy who gets unexpectedly swept up in Welles brilliant circle. Had the movie which is set in 1937 centered more on Welles and his seminal production of Julius Caesar it would have been fascinating. But as a theatrical coming-of-age story its slight only sporadically enjoyable and sometimes corny. McKays performance is a revelation. He nails Welles imperiousness charm and vocal cadences and even bears a strong resemblance to the iconic actor/director. He is thoroughly convincing as Welles and electrifies the screen when hes on it The Me in the title refers to a teenage aspiring actor named Richard played by Zac Efron. Unfortunately too much time is spent with Efron a likable but lackluster presence. By a stroke of luck 17-year-old Richard wins a part in Welles Caesar. He strolls by New Yorks Mercury Theater one afternoon and the next thing he knows hes drafted to play the ukulele (which doubles as a lute) and given a role opposite Welles Brutus. Over the course of a week Richard dubbed ""Junior"" is pulled into the impetuous Welles inner circle and finds romance with an older woman (Claire Danes). Efron is hampered by occasional mumbling and lacks the chemistry with Danes to make their connection believable. And Richards chance meeting with an aspiring writer (Zoe Kazan) is stilted. Much of the movie is bathed in a golden glow and the score helps to conjure the era. But some of the dialogue sounds modern. This is not one of director Richard Linklaters better films. It lacks the intimacy of Before Sunset and the sense of celebration of The School of Rock. The movie is worth seeing for McKay but it sometimes feels like two movies cobbled together. Efrons Richard is somewhat of a cipher. Its unclear why hes drawn to acting though he eventually realizes that he is committed to being a part of the artistic world. Welles would use the same encouraging words to pump up his chosen players. At one point he praises Richards ""magnificence."" Though Welles doesnt consistently enthrall as a tribute to the stage McKay is a magnificent surprise.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The problem with films about theater is that they tend to feel theatrical. Theyre less about human beings than about actors pretending to be actors pretending to be human beings. Thats a central weakness of Richard Linklaters disappointing new period drama Me And Orson Welles a terminally bland coming-of-age story about a pretty young man with the worlds most awesome after-school job. The featherweight trifle gives us a busy assemblage of familiar theatrical types--the womanizing actor the vain diva with an almost preternatural grasp of how shes being lit at any given moment the cast cut-up the imperious impresario and ingenues male and female--then pitches its performances unabashedly to the rafters. Its poor players are shameless hams on and offstage wrapped up in dramas of their own devising. Zac Efron plays a dreamy high-school student who bluffs his way into Orson Welles Mercury Theater winning a role in its daring modern-dress production of Julius Caesar which recast Shakespeares scheming Romans as contemporary Fascists. The life lessons begin when Efron falls for production assistant Claire Danes a brassy career girl who broadcasts rather than hides her burning ambition. Shes going places and will hitch her wagon to whoever can get her there quickest. Efron has yet to learn that smiling pretty is merely a component of acting not its entirety. He makes for a supremely passive lead whose chemistry with Danes is nonexistent; he seems infinitely more enamored of his image in any reflective surface than in his ostensible love interest. Playing an appropriately majestic Orson Welles newcomer Christian McKay boldly fills the charisma vacuum the two leads leave. McKay is blustery over-the-top and wildly theatrical but so was the man hes portraying. Me And Orson Welles casts off the musty air of a handsomely mounted tastefully dull HBO TV movie only when McKay takes center stage as when he shocks and delights his fellow cast members in a mediocre radio show by incongruously inserting a lyrical passage from The Magnificent Ambersons into their hacky little drama. Me And Orson Welles belongs to that loveable show-biz subgenre about colorful kooks mounting a big production but its strictly a one-man show.

"Me and Orson Welles | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; me-and-orson-welles ) Me and Orson Welles (United States 2008) November 24 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Me and Orson Welles is about the theater or at least the theater as it was in the 1930s. Based on the semi-fictional novel by Robert Kaplow and set in New York City around the time of the opening of the Mercury Theater the film is rich in period detail. It chronicles not only how Welles put together his now-famous stage production of Shakespeares Julius Caesar but how it was to work around and with the temperamental genius. In a departure from his usual intimate character-based fare director Richard Linklater paints on a broad cinematic canvas that brings Depression-era Broadway vividly to life. The lead character is aspiring actor Richard Samuels (Zac Efron) a teenager who is picked by Welles (Christian McKay) to appear in Julius Caesar even before he graduates from high school. Welles however is a notoriously difficult boss. One moment he is cruel and dismissive. The next he acts like a mentor bringing Richard with him to a radio studio and allowing him to observe as Welles improvises lines in a live audio play. Since Richards role as Lucillus is relatively minor the young performer is given ample time to observe the behind-the-scenes goings-on at the Mercury. Two famous actors Joseph Cotton (James Tupper) and George Coulouris (Ben Chaplin) are involved in the production and John Houseman (Eddie Marsan) is Welles partner in the business side of the venture. For Richard however the Mercurys real attraction aside from the opportunity to work with Welles is Sonja Jones (Claire Danes) Welles secretary. He pursues her with the dogged single-mindedness of a young man in love. In a courageous move Linklater devotes the better part of the films final half-hour to exacting re-creations of scenes from Julius Caesar providing a view of how the play might have looked on Opening Night. Theres not enough of the play for someone unaware of its general trajectory to understand whats happening but those who have seen or read it will be able not only to follow the excerpts but be able to understand the uniqueness of Welles vision. The unfortunately downside of this approach is that it narrows the target audience considerably. The ostensible star is Zac Efron who chose this role as an opportunity to step far away from the parts that have made him famous. (Its difficult to imagine many members of his core audience enjoying Me and Orson Welles.) His heartthrob status effectively submerged Efron is solid although unspectacular. Its difficult to see it when Welles calls Richard a ""natural born actor"" but Efrons performance is workmanlike and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. Likewise Claire Danes snaps off her dialogue like a whip and exhibits sufficient screen presence to avoid being a liability. The love affair between Richard and Sonja despite being underplayed is believable. Both Efron and Danes however exist in the shadow of Christian McKay whose portrayal of Welles captures the essence of the great man impatient egotistic arrogant brilliant and a perfectionist. Its all there - the good and the bad - presented with such astonishing force that its impossible for McKay to not dominate every scene in which he appears. (McKay before making this movie had played Welles in a stage play.) Physically McKay bears a passing resemblance to Welles but his voice is uncannily exact - so much so that if you watch with your eyes closed the experience is almost eerie. Not since Anthony Hopkins took over a movie with his supporting role in The Silence of the Lambs has a secondary actor so dominated a movie. Me and Orson Welles is designed primarily for those who are intrigued by theater curious about Welles or some combination of both. The films storyline is strong enough to provide structure for the production but it is dramatically limited. Despite Linklaters directorial credit and Efrons name at the top of the marquee Me and Orson Welles has taken fourteen months since its September 2008 world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival to obtain a limited United States release. Many distributors passed on the movie not because they werent impressed by its craft but because the potential audience is restricted. This is a specialty movie. Those in its demographic will fall under its impressive spell but it will be difficult to find enough of those individuals to make the production profitable. McKay alone is well worth the price of admission and if Me and Orson Welles proves to be too small for the Academy to notice his performance could go down as one of the great overlooked ones of the decade. Many tremendous movies could be made about Welles whose larger-than-life personality would easily lend itself to an epic. From his critically adored stage productions to his War of the Worlds Halloween broadcast to his cinematic debut (and pinnacle) Citizen Kane to the travesty of The Magnificent Ambersons few 20th century personalities were more colorful. For Me and Orson Welles we are presented not only with a minor slice from the mans life but one that is shown through the eyes of another. Its an effective way to introduce the essence of Welles without overwhelming the viewer with his life story.

The story of the impressionable young boy who meets a great and powerful man is an old one. But whats the filmmaker to do when the mentor is a much more interesting character than the protege? Thats the problem faced by ""Me and Orson Welles"" a movie about a high-schooler who somehow manages to nab a role in Welles classic 1937 stage production of ""Julius Caesar."" Me and Orson Welles (PG-13) Freestyle (114 min.) Directed by Richard Linklater. With Zac Efron Christian McKay. Now playing in New York. Stephen WHittys rating TWO AND A HALF STARS Ratings note The film contains strong language and sexual situations. These sorts of stories work best when the icon (who also invariably turns out to have feet of clay) is a purely fictional person or at least a famous person barely glimpsed. Bring him on too often and he steals the show. Which Christian McKay does effortlessly here. Hes not a perfect match physically. Welles who was -- want to feel like a slacker? -- only 22 when ""Julius Caesar"" debuted still had a face rimmed with baby fat. And although McKay does a close approximation of that sonorous voice its only close. But he gets Welles mood right ever self-absorbed ever ambitious ever volatile (there was a reason his theater company was called Mercury). Welles loved characters but like many geniuses he wasnt terribly attuned to people; he would share top billing with Shakespeare but grabbed credit from everyone else. He was also according to this movie -- based on a book by New Jerseys Robert Kaplow -- as self-destructive as Shakespeares own heroes. His hubris was his own love of crises; they gave him the chance to make an entrance and triumph. Until one day he didnt and his career shifted under him like sand. Yet while this movie gets Welles right and the communal joy of theater (Linklater has always been good at spotlighting outcast cultures) it gets some other things quite wrong. One is the New York of the Depression era re-created here in Great Britain. Unfortunately the Isle of Man is not Manhattan island and nothing on-screen quite convinces. Nor does star Zac Efron look like a 30s teen -- for one thing his hairs too long -- or capture our interest. Hes supposed to love the theater yet we never really know why or how it began or even what he dreams of -- just vague dreams about his liking plays and movies and you know songs and things. We watch him getting the chance of a lifetime and yet we never see him work at it. We never know this boy. I do however know one of the people who have been misrepresented on-screen here and thats another problem - and one that ""fictional histories"" like this seem to incur constantly. Only this time instead of merely rewriting the dead theyve taken on the living. You see one of the great triumphs of Welles reimagined ""Julius Caesar"" was the scene portraying the death of Cinna. He was played by Norman Lloyd who was born in Jersey City and went on to a long career (he played the title role in ""Saboteur"" Dr. Auschlander on ""St. Elsewhere"" - and just recently the nursing home patient in ""In Her Shoes""). The real Norman Lloyd is a devoted husband and an erudite man (I interviewed him two years ago and although 93 then he was still going strong). But the movies Norman Lloyd -- hes called that by name -- is a sloppy vulgarian who looks like a Stooge sounds like a failed Borscht Belt comedian and chases skirts like an amorous terrier. I hope the real Lloyd -- who was actually a newlywed in 1937 -- sues not just for his own sake but to slow down this trend. Im getting very weary of filmmakers making up conversations inventing motives and creating events so that their ""based on a real story"" movie can get to ""the real truth."" Because actually theres only one real truth. And thats the truth that actually happened.

By David Denby Zac Efron Christian McKay and Claire Danes in Richard Linklaters new movie.   Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell The lips are wrong. Well at any rate theyre different thin and pursed rather than fleshy and cherubic. But Christian McKay the thirty-six-year-old British actor who plays the young Orson Welles in ""Me and Orson Welles"" has the necessary stature and the vaunting authority for the job. McKay has an easy way with a cigar too and a small sly smile and a strong voice. Not that voice with its sonic-boom impact but a fine leathery instrument. ""I am Orson Welles"" he thunders when challenged. ""I own the store."" The year is 1937 when the great man is twenty-two. The newly formed Mercury Theatre under the joint direction of Welles and John Houseman (Eddie Marsan) is mounting its first production in New York--a heavily cut and rearranged version of Shakespeares ""Julius Caesar"" with the characters dressed in the uniforms and long coats of the Italian Fascists. We see Welles through the eyes of a cocky seventeen-year-old Richard Samuels (Zac Efron) a New Jersey kid who bluffs his way into the company. Richard Linklater the director and Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo the screenwriters (who adapted Robert Kaplows 2003 novel of the same title) create a bond between the boy and the theatre big shot. Welles recognizes Samuels as a fellow-mover and for a frantic week as the production lurches toward opening night the two of them take each others measure. Its a drastically unequal contest. Welles plays Brutus in the production but his will is closer to Caesars. He seduces and bullies everyone drops actors from the script at will exercises droit du seigneur over the women in the company and in general acts as if he were God incarnate which for all practical purposes he is. The actors and the craftsmen admire him loathe him and know that they couldnt have theatrical careers of comparable magnitude without him--all New York awaits the opening. The plot unfortunately is conventionally conceived Richard gets initiated into sex and other fascinating and complicated rites of the grownup world; that is he gets warmed and then burned by people more experienced and ruthless than anyone could be at seventeen. Weve seen this rueful coming-of-age story before. And weve seen other movies about the staging of a famous production. But if ""Me and Orson Welles"" isnt as witty as ""Shakespeare in Love"" which after all had a script shined up by Tom Stoppard its much better than ""Cradle Will Rock"" Tim Robbinss 1999 account of another legendary early Welles project a movie with too many characters and too narrow a view (i.e. orthodox left) of the relation of money and art. The strength of ""Me and Orson Welles"" is that it sticks to Welless actual production and to the life of a new theatre company. This is a movie of great spirit and considerable charm. Its about the giddiness of promise--the awakening of young talent after years of the Depression to a moment when anything seems possible. Working with a limited budget Linklater found a vintage theatre on the Isle of Man which doubles for the Mercury on West Forty-first Street (formerly the Comedy and now long gone); he and his crew reconstructed nineteen-thirties-style New York exteriors at Pinewood Studios outside London and assembled a decent cast to support McKay. As Samuels Zac Efron the dancing teen heartthrob and shirtless Internet sensation is surprisingly winning. Efron draws on his confident good looks (from certain angles this Jewish hoofer from California looks like of all people Tyrone Power) without being smug. Hes an actor after all--maybe even a genuine star. And the even better-looking Claire Danes of the foot-wide smile achieves something difficult as Welless secretary Sonja Jones a friendly and likable woman whose ambition is nevertheless so ravenous that she cant be trusted for a second. There are many minor characters swiftly and easily drawn. Linklater the director of ""Slacker"" ""School of Rock"" and many other movies usually works with pop culture; this is his first foray into the classics. Quippy fast and enjoyably corny ""Welles"" is like a musical comedy without songs. The music is mostly swing hits from the period along with Marc Blitzsteins martial drums-and-brass score for the original production which is played (with the musicians missing many cues) throughout the film. As opening night nears Richards adventures are of secondary interest and we welcome with relish the movies returning again and again to Welles. He carries on like a much older man--Henry Irving for example or some other flamboyant groundbreaking actor-manager of the nineteenth century who raised money edited texts designed sets starred in many of the productions and kept the company going. But Welles has a modernist temperament and a subversive love of shock. Hes abrasive treacherous boastful and inconstant blocking and reblocking the show at the last minute. At first this bombast no matter how amusing feels too broadly vociferous. Then it becomes clear that Linklater and McKay are portraying Welles as a man whos consciously entertaining and stimulating his company playing the black-hearted son of a bitch creating a crisis atmosphere so that he can pull everything together at the last minute and save the day. What reconciles us to him and also compels the actors including Joseph Cotten (James Tupper) and George Coulouris (Ben Chaplin) to stay with him is his theatrical intelligence. Welles directs as he acts moving people around between lines getting them to lower or raise their voices or shape a phrase in a different way. Hes like a conductor who points out mistakes while pushing the music forward. And when opening night finally arrives and we get to see chunks of the production the old radical theatre ideas still have power. The stage is bare the back wall a rust red the violence frightening and the audience stunned. For moviegoers however the triumph is bittersweet. A theatrical performance can be altered and revised until just before the curtain rises but a movie with its thousands of interlocking details requires long-range planning consistency and reliability. In Welless rabbit-out-of-the-hat victory of 1937 one sees the habits that will lead not only to a few peerless films but also to many defeats and tragically abandoned projects. Snakes in their sinister side-to-side way slither through floodwaters menacing a man held in an underground jail; alligators climb onto a freeway causing cars to smash into one another; iguanas lounge on coffee tables turning their yellow-green eyes on the humans around them. In brief Werner Herzog has checked into New Orleans and metaphysical despair has been loosed upon Bourbon Street. ""Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans"" is set during the months after Katrina. A local drug kingpin is killing African-born interlopers in the white-powder trade; Detective Terence McDonagh (Nicolas Cage) tries to stop him sort of while grabbing as much cocaine as he can for himself. The movie is an approximate remake of the notorious Abel Ferrara film of 1992 in which Harvey Keitel bullied thieved snorted and fornicated his way to immortality as a crooked and sometimes naked New York cop. Herzog in his ineffably high-minded manner has bristled at the ""theoreticians of cinema"" who would compare his picture with the earlier one which he says he has not seen. (""Go for it losers"" he tells them.) I am not a theoretician but as a mere vulgar critic I have to report that Ferraras work was a highly sexual affair with a real sense of pleasure in violation--a movie immersed in sub-Scorsesean despair guilt self-indulgence and redemption. Herzogs film by contrast is both an intermittent police procedural and an outrageously diverting celebration of crack mania. The character Keitel played may have been falling apart but as an actor he remained a solid chunk of Gods earth entirely grounded; Nicolas Cage is pixillated. At the beginning of the movie the Lieutenant injures his back while saving the snake-menaced jailbird. The back never heals and McDonagh stomps through the city with one shoulder held higher than the other his brow furrowed his lips curled in anguish. He looks like Quasimodo without a bell rope to hang on to. Herzog sends this literally cracked detective into dangerous houses and down darkened streets gun drawn like any other cop pursuing leads. But the next minute McDonagh will have a hallucination--he sees a dead body break-dancing--or explode into hysterics his face violently wrenched into an enormous grin. Herzog who seems to be drawing on the audiences affection for him as an inspired madman may not care to tell a story straight anymore. The poetic possibilities of drug addiction have both liberated and overwhelmed him. The movie is a mess but its certainly not dull. At the end McDonagh asks ""Do fishes dream?"" Thats the kind of question Herzog finds interesting and it inspires many questions of comparable fascination Do clouds have an unconscious? Do pinball machines steal the souls of the drunken truck drivers who pull their levers? Conundrums like wandering lizards pile up at the gates of the cinema.

An extraordinary impersonation of the American theatrical boy wonder by the young English actor Christian McKay is the indisputable highlight of ""Me and Orson Welles"" an agreeable reasonably convincing imagining of the circumstances surrounding Welles legendary staging of ""Julius Caesar."" Another lets-put-on-a-show venture for Zac Efron albeit of a rather more sophisticated variety this British-produced period piece will test how much the ""High School Musical"" star means as a movie name. Richard Linklaters amiable entertainment will likely score OK numbers theatrically with a nice ancillary life awaiting. Script by longtime Linklater associates Holly Gent Palmo and Vince Palmo closely adheres to the contours of Robert Kaplows novel which drops a fictional theater-crazed 17-year-old into the final week of rehearsals of Welles vaunted 1937 modern-dress version of Shakespeares play. Aside from the kid Kaplows work was a thoroughly researched account that provided a plausible feel for what it might have been like during those final crazy days before the opening. Linklater absolutely honors that fidelity to theater history involving such affiliated figures as John Houseman Joseph Cotten and Norman Lloyd in the drama and creating a credible look for scenes from the Mercury Theaters ""Caesar"" production itself no small accomplishment. The perspective on these momentous days in theater lore is provided by Richard Samuels (Efron) a high school student who after a chance sidewalk encounter is asked by Welles to play the small role of Lucius. Ambitious can-do assistant Sonja (Claire Danes) warms to Richard quickly while Welles sweeps him into his orbit by taking him by speeding ambulance to one of his day jobs where he dazzles all by improvising during a live-theater broadcast. Its a heady world Richard has landed in. At a mere 22 Welles had just recently served notice of his brilliance with his all-black production of ""Macbeth"" in Harlem and he and Houseman (Eddie Marsan) with whom he bickers here constantly are intent on making theatrical history with the Mercury show. Early on Richard is warned never to criticize the boss and told hell have to tolerate lots of bad behavior in exchange for the the privilege of basking in genius. The somewhat unlikely personal plot has Richard becoming involved with older woman Sonja the ""ice queen"" whos the object of unrequited lust for every man in the company including ladies man Cotten (James Tupper) then exploding when he feels betrayed by Welles. But the immature boy inevitably takes a back seat to Welles himself especially when hes represented as uncannily as he is by McKay. McKay who previously portrayed the big man in the stage piece ""Rosebud The Lives of Orson Welles"" has very much the right look for Welles at that time. More crucially he can reproduce the sonorous vocal timbre. Best of all he precisely catches Welles humor with arched eyebrow ironic sense of amusement and mocking self-modesty. This Welles permits just one fleeting glimpse of his inner self when he shows Richard his marked-up copy of ""The Magnificent Ambersons."" Otherwise he consists of one part intimidating bluster two parts seductive charm and three parts talent and there are moments especially when Welles is alternating between acting as Brutus and directing everyone else that its possible to forget youre watching an actor and really believe youre beholding Orson Welles at work. At one point it seemed on the basis of five minutes in ""Ed Wood"" that the only actor who could convincingly portray Welles was Vincent DOnofrio. Now McKays got the job whenever theres call for it. Shot in the unlikely setting of the Isle of Man notably in its restored Gaiety Theater which fills in beautifully and London pic does a reasonable job of repping Depression-era Gotham on a budget. But the film and the comic moments in particular could have used more snap some real New York energy. Theres too much spare time for dates and private encounters during the mad run-up to opening night; the novels frantic sweaty-palms sense of nerves is lacking here. Although hes adequate Efron never feels like a proper fit for Richard. The handsome thesp is too self-possessed and sure of himself for a teenage interloper in the big time; he lacks uncertainty and self-doubt. Danes is energetic and engaging as a smart woman most attuned to self-interest. Marsan as Houseman Leo Bill as Lloyd Tupper as Cotten and Ben Chaplin as the self-important eternally pessimistic actor George Coulouris all have their moments. Production and costume design help bring the period of 70 years ago to life. Richard Popes widescreen lensing is well composed but images looked weak as if from too dim a projector bulb in the digital presentation caught at the first Toronto fest public showing. End credits were incomplete so final running time will be two or three minutes longer than the posted 109 minutes.
