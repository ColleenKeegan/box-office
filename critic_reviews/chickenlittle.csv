Comments Chicken Little Recommended After dragging its heels for a decade Walt Disney Pictures ventures into the brave new world of computer animation with this feature-length story about a chick that irony of ironies is way ahead of the curve. Animation fans will find this worth the wait--the marvelously detailed characters are soft and supple--though apparently theres no story-generating software that can tap into the dark recesses of a childs psyche as cannily as Uncle Walt once did. The title bird mortally embarrasses its father by mistakenly telling the whole town the sky is falling but the tables are turned after spaceships land dispensing giant spidery creatures straight out of H.G. Wells. Mark Dindal directed; among the voice talent are Zach Braff Garry Marshall Don Knotts Patrick Stewart and Amy Sedaris. G 77 min. By J.R.

Thank heavens then that the production team elected to give him an engagingly droll adult voice (Zach Braff) and not a twee Tweety Pie-style twitter or you too may have felt the urge to lob grenades at the screen. The film is being promoted as Disneys first ever foray into computer animation. Its not an auspicious start the mostly unimaginative characters and backgrounds on display here are no better rendered than those in Pixars first Toy Story film; and how long ago was that? Indeed judging by the generally uncreative level of detail all round its perhaps just as well that Disney has recently bought Pixar from Steve Apple Jobs. The content of the film is no great shakes either the cry wolf storyline simply isnt strong enough to survive an 80-minute running-time and aside from a few amusing witticisms and a couple of well-oiled film references (yawn) most of the jokes fall flat. One can only assume its target audience will be a little easier to please.

Perhaps thats because its impossible to watch a childrens animated movie these days without thinking of the gold standard of Pixar ""The Incredibles"" ""Finding Nemo"" ""Monsters Inc."" ""Toy Story."" These are all richly plotted witty and touching films that enchant both children and adults with the sophistication of their storytelling and design. ""Chicken Little"" by contrast is just kind of cute. Little kids will likely enjoy it; parents may fidget just a bit. The cuteness begins with the title character (voiced by Zach Braff) whos about as stuffed-animal-adorable as movie characters can be Chicken Little is a teeny fellow with a big fluffy head and green-rimmed glasses that match his wee green T-shirt. Hes your basic Disney Movie Misfit a town outcast because nobody believed him a year ago when he announced that the sky was falling. His tough-guy dad (Garry Marshall) is embarrassed by him and the other animals at school mock him. When our little friend shocks everyone by displaying heroics on the baseball field his fortunes change. But then something drops from the sky yet again. Aliens (including a nifty pair voiced by Catherine OHara and Fred Willard) invade and Chicken Little must find a way to make everyone believe him -- most important his dad. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Chicken Little"" with the voices of Zach Braff Garry Marshall Joan Cusack Steve Zahn Don Knotts Amy Sedaris Harry Shearer Patrick Stewart Wallace Shawn Fred Willard Catherine OHara. Directed by Mark Dindal from a screenplay by Steve Bencich Ron J. Friedman and Ron Anderson. 78 minutes. Rated G. Several theaters. Its an odd up-and-down storyline and its told with too many shortcuts pop songs used in place of dialogue and emotion pop references used in place of jokes. (Theres a bit about cellphones that falls completely flat and a Barbra Streisand reference thats mystifying.) And while some of the voice work is first-rate -- Braff and Marshall are fine and Joan Cusack is charming as Chicken Littles friend the Ugly Duckling -- other celebrity cameos seem pointless. Patrick Stewart voices an elegant sheep Wallace Shawn a sputtering school principal and both sound exactly right. (Indeed wouldnt you want to live in a world where all sheep sounded like Patrick Stewart?) But theyre in the film for a mere instant; without a character to play it just feels like stunt casting. The animation which has a faintly 3-D look to it (particularly Chicken Littles downy head) is colorful and serviceable with some nice attention to detail. (When Chicken Little lies on a bed hes so lightweight he barely makes a dent on the quilt.) But as Disneys first attempt at a fully computer-animated feature film it in no way leaps ahead of Pixars films or of other recent efforts like DreamWorks ""Shrek."" ""Chicken Little"" sporadically shows some real imagination particularly in the alien family a three-eyed puffball trio done in red orange and yellow. But as Disneys attempt to catch up with the rest of the field it falls short. A cute central character while it might satisfy the kids is not enough to sustain a movie. Then again hell probably make a great stuffed animal.

"Cheep Thrills washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Cheep Thrills The sky really is falling in Walt Disneys computer-animated bucket o fun. (Walt Disney Pictures Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 4 2005 About halfway through ""Chicken Little"" a subversive thought came to mind and try as I might I could not quell it. It took the form of a single word. And that word was . . . ""Popeyes."" But thats my chicken problem. I like to eat em I dont like to go to movies about em. There havent been too many great chicken movies. And I think they look better in a sizzling vat of grease turning crusty-crispy than pecking noisily in the dirt for pieces of feed. Ugh. Theyre kind of dirty and that red floppy stuff around their heads? What exactly is that? Anyhow ""Chicken Little"" the movie avoids the ugly-dirty-squawky-stinking chicken issue by portraying the creatures as tidy bourgeois small-towners about as scabby and dirty as say your average Iowa Republican. These chickens are so peppy cheery clean and industrious they probably could get into the Rotary and the Kiwanis with no questions asked. In fact they look like the people who sell meaty fryers to Popeyes. That adds up to a movie that will be beloved by most chicken lovers including chickens themselves Wade Boggs children dogs and cats mice and crickets and so forth. Many big beings including adults and cows and the odd anthropomorphic SUV will also enjoy it. (Note The film is showing in 3-D at Loews Georgetown Regal Countryside Sterling and Lee Highway Cinemas Merrifield.) Based on the old tale and the image of ardent mythological stupidity -- the chicken who thought the sky was falling when an acorn fell on its head -- this computer-animated geewhizzer takes the story one more crank toward the literal. When the thing hits Chicken Little it turns out guess what it is a piece of the sky the sky is falling. Its like saying McCarthy was right Sheesh revisionist history Its everywhere The movie then wittily finds a way to morph into a fabulous parody of ""War of the Worlds"" possibly a bit intense in parts for the smallest of beings and for just a moment another subversive idea came to mind more potent than the dream of spice-saturated white meat frying up in nodules of brown crispy grit and smoking with heat and heartburn. Could the Walt Disney Co. have actually unleashed on the unsuspecting public a movie in the form of a G-rated cartoon in which . . . heh heh . . . the world as we know it ends and the few of us who survive are turned into slaves But no The film backs away from this interesting proposition and chooses sound family values -- the lessons of love loyalty and brotherhood tolerance and peace -- over sheer nihilism. Drat I hate when that happens. Set in the lush small town of Oakey Oaks the worlds acorn capital and the only town in the United States populated by poultry and fish Chicken Little here represented as an earnest 50s teenager is one day at play under the big oak tree in the square when whacko hes blasted in the skull by an actual piece of sky. No dummy -- even for a chicken-- he repairs to the town hall bell tower and begins proclaiming a la the old story the imminent fall of the sky After much movie spectacle -- in the panic the town water tower topples spilling a caldron of water that rolls through the streets and smashes through a movie screen that is showing ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" just at the moment when the rolling rock is about to squash Indy -- its revealed that his interpretation was off and he becomes the town joke. Thus the movies first half is a little domestic drama of self-actualization in which Chicken Little -- the voice is Zach Braff (""Garden State"" and TVs ""Scrubs"") -- tries to find a way to regain the towns regard and the respect of his goofy ever-decent but deeply disappointed dad (Garry Marshall a little New Yorky for the wholesome surroundings). The method he chooses is baseball. Ever see chickens play baseball? No? Then you havent lived. They play baseball better than they play tick-tack-toe and even the littlest chicken manages to get wood on the ball at a key moment in the game and become a hero. But really we are just marking time until the Disney animators feel enough minutes have passed so that the actual sky-is-falling motif can be transmogrified into a full-scale alien invasion with killer-being whirley birds hunting children in the cornfields along with adults and vehicles to say nothing of civilization its own self being vaporized by an army of creatures from the imagination of Steven Spielberg (the ""War of the Worlds"" Steven Spielberg not the ""E.T."" Steven Spielberg). Its full-out interplanetary species war Or at least for a while. The animators are -- you almost no longer have to say this -- fabulous and full of mischief weaving enough ironic amusements into the story for the longer of tooth. Theres a gimmick where the world is ending but the big fat pig cant get a vending machine to accept a wrinkled dollar. As a man whose dollars are always wrinkled I especially enjoyed this witty little aside which maybe nine people will even notice. But it means that somebody is paying attention. Chicken Little (77 minutes at area theaters) is rated G though rather intense for small or easily frightened children.

Actor Zach Braff provides the voice for ""Chicken ... more Photo Walt Disney Studios A pretty amusing little Chicken but Pixar it aint 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Chicken Little Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Zach Braff Garry Marshall Joan Cusack and Don Knotts. Directed by Mark Dindal. (Rated G. 81 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) As protagonists go Chicken Little starts out somewhere between Winston Churchill and the Runaway Bride. Hes virtually alone in warning his neighbors about an approaching evil and becomes the type of outcast who spurs endless hours of talk on the farm-animal version of ""Inside Edition."" Yes ""Chicken Little"" is a modernization of an old story and that includes a sky thats falling in the form of alien invaders. But as cluttered as the movie gets before the ending its funny throughout with some 1970s and 80s music thrown in to keep adults happy. Its not by chance that ""Chicken Little"" comes out in the beginning of November typically the time slot for animated movies that arent good enough for a summer or holiday release. Disneys first homegrown computer-made movie benefits from a little distance from the ""Nemos"" and ""Shreks"" of the world -- the visuals are decent enough and the majority of the jokes hit but its still only about 65 percent as good as the worst Pixar film. Zach Braff voices Chicken Little an eager young bird in the barnyard-themed town of Oakey Oaks. After his warning that ""the sky is falling"" causes a minor disaster he becomes a media pariah -- complete with his own movie-of-the-week. (""Hey look Mama"" a little kid taunts. ""Theres the crazy little chicken."") Despite his physical similarities to Egghead Jr. from the Foghorn Leghorn cartoons Chicken Little is by far the most memorable and enjoyable character in a film populated with been-there-done-thats. From Chicken Littles disappointed father (shades of Hank Hill) to his oversize pig sidekick (shades of every character voiced by John Ratzenberger) theres nothing original here other than an alarming number of morbidly obese characters. ""Chicken Little"" shifts influences every 20 minutes or so throwing in a ""Bad News Bears"" subplot before the ""War of the Worlds"" finale. Thankfully the humor remains consistent as the plot meanders with roughly the same two-good-jokes-for-every-groaner ratio that kept ""Robots"" and ""Madagascar"" from failure. Although the two original songs featuring Joss Stone and Barenaked Ladies are excuses for a potty break theres a running joke involving older music that will keep parents and grandparents from falling asleep -- with R.E.M. and Gloria Gaynor songs making particularly appropriate appearances in the final act. For any great-grandparents in the audience Don Knotts shows up too as the voice of a turkey who is two parts Barney Fife and one part Mr. Furley. ""Chicken Little"" is also showing in the new Digital 3-D technology at the Loews Metreon in San Francisco the Century 20 Oakridge in San Jose the Century 20 Daly City and the Regal Hacienda Crossings 20 in Dublin. These shows cost a little more but look quite good -- kind of like watching a movie version of a View-Master toy. If you can withstand the shame of wearing the dorky green glasses the 3-D screenings are worth seeking out. -- Advisory Although ""Chicken Little"" is virtually painless for adults it contains a few mild scares and your kids may force you to see the inevitable sequel which will probably be impossible to watch.

"This chick flick is just goosey loosey - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Pixar This chick flick is just goosey looseymovies - reviewNovember 4 2005|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie Critic""The sky is falling The sky is falling""From Wall Street to Main Street USA you could hear the Disney stockholders cry.""Eisner chased off Pixar""But not to worry. Disney is perfectly capable of doing its own computer-animated (3-D) cartoons. Or so the Mouse House would have you believe.Chicken Little the first Disney-post-Pixar 3-D cartoon to hit theaters is perfectly competent animation. It just lacks Pixars wit and heart. If this is what the studios animation future looks like the best we can hope for is on a par with Ice Age Shark Tale Shrek II -- pretty and pretty mediocre.Lots of pop-tune montages stretch this thinner-than-thin comedy into its kid-friendly 78 minutes. With its endless yak-yak-yak chatter about a son needing ""closure"" and jokes like the voice of AOL sputtering ""Your hate mail box is full"" its a comedy that will zip straight over the heads of the 10-and-unders. And Chicken is almost all filler no heart.The story though has ""cant miss"" built into it. Chicken Little (voiced by Zach Braff of TVs Scrubs) is a shrimp of a chick who once embarrassed himself and his widowed dad (Garry Marshall) by proclaiming that the sky was falling.""Keep a low profile"" Dad urges him. Dont draw attention to yourself.But whats a chick to do when the sky really is falling?A piece of an alien spaceship one with cloaking invisibility hits him. And by golly Mayor Turkey Lurkey Goosey Loosey Morkubine Porcupine even Foxy Loxy should be warned.Only the Ugly Duckling (Joan Cusack) the Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) and the daffy Fish-out-of-Water believe him.Dad? He has a lesson to learn.""Ya gotta listen to your children. Even if they have nothing to say.""Child psychotherapy message aside the thinness of this reveals itself in an instant. The fish is a knockoff of South Parks Kenny (muffled voice). The incessant pauses while another pop tune (""The End of the World as We Know It"" ""We Are the Champions"" ""Gonna Make You Sweat"" the Spice Girls ""Wannabe"") plays out Shrek-style betray a lack of ideas.Heres a dirty little secret to movie cartoons. The more ""names"" in the cast the weaker the movie. Patrick Stewart voices a teacher Don Knotts is the mayor Toy Story vet Wallace Shawn shows up with Patrick Warburton Amy Sedaris Catherine OHara Harry Shearer Adam West Fred Willard and others clocking in. None save West makes an impression.The War of the Worlds slam-bang action in the third act might work better with 3-D glasses a gimmick Disney is trying in select theaters (AMC Pleasure Island and Regal Waterford Lakes). But even thats a sign of desperation.When Disney cant hit a tried-and-true fairy-tale adaptation out of the park maybe its time to give up the ghost and get Pixar back on the phone. Or shut off the computers and go back to what animators used to use -- the drawing board.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Chicken is a Little over the topBy Mike Clark USA TODAY As creature features go lusciously pigmented child-friendly Chicken Little is no Howard the Duck. But it also isnt quite the computer-animated home run Disney really needs post-Pixar despite its inclusion of a long baseball sequence aliens and a whole lot more. The Ugly Duckling (voiced by Joan Cusack) Runt (Steve Zahn) and Chicken Little (Zach Braff) are part of the menagerie. Walt Disney Pictures With one of the years busiest scripts Little launches 76 zippy minutes by starting with what we know Its shy bespectacled protagonist announces to the town of Oakey Oaks that the sky has fallen when townspeople believe an airborne acorn is the real culprit. About the movie Chicken Little    (out of four) Stars Voices of Zach Braff Garry Marshall Joan Cusack Steve Zahn Amy Sedaris Director Mark Dindal Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating G Running time 1 hour 17 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The rest of the movie is follow-up picking up a year later and asking ""Hows the fallout been?"" Humiliating thats how. Chicken (voice of Zach Braff) has had to deal with being the standout generator of publicity in a small town -- and this is not a case of any publicity being good publicity. Whats more he hasnt lived up to the expectations of a jock-ish single dad (Garry Marshall as meaty ""Buck Cluck"") hence the baseball sequence. It wouldnt be a Chicken Little saga without a Foxy Loxy (Amy Sedaris) or Mayor Turkey Lurkey (Don Knotts). Chicken also spends a lot of his time with another social outcast Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack her voice easily identifiable). You expect to see all of them here which is more than you can say for the eventual appearance of ... space aliens out of War of the Worlds. Yes and the attack visuals all but replicate the 1953 versions which by suspicious concidence is just out in a fresh DVD edition (with the Spielberg version coming in three weeks). Cross-pollination anyone? The invasion material is acceptably funny and even casts Fred Willard and Catherine OHara as alien parents. But theres something a little scattershot about this movies incessant aim to please which extends to a soundtrack littered with 70s pop like All I Know and Dont Go Breaking My Heart. Chicken Little is playing a few venues in 3-D which really must be something Even when shown flat its colors jump off the screen. But even if you were to see the film projected on a tree it is family entertainment that will generate thanks from parents. After all theaters are now showing trailers for (oh yes) Cheaper by the Dozen 2. When comparing the two one hastens to beat a reasonably enthused rat-tat-tat with Chickens drumstick.

Yet theres something weirdly ironic about celebrating a feisty fowl when so many news stories about an avian flu pandemic suggest that at any minute a massive chunk of sky will tumble down on our own heads. We pray that never transpires. But it would be just fine if this terse charmer of a G-rated flick catches on. Because the can-do pluck of the movies little Cluck - his dads name is Buck Cluck - with the large spectacles and tufts of white down is fairly contagious. As ""Chicken Little"" opens its been a year since the ""acorn incident."" ""Why dont I go back to the day things took a turn for the worst"" a narrator intones. That was when Bucks youngster rang Oakey Oaks town bells and caused a panic. The sky was falling the sky was falling. Or maybe not. Littles Dad tries best he can to cover for his son naming the famous acorn as culprit. It was a reaction - most thought an overreaction - that was hard to live down. Theres a movie about the disaster set to open. Product tie-ins exploit the mishap. Websites plumb it for meaning. Even single father Buck once the towns baseball hero has to live with the bumper stickers. Yet Chicken Little (Zach Braff of ""Scrubs"") does his best to carry on. Hes aided in this endeavor by friends and fellow misfits Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) and Abby Mallard a.k.a. Ugly Duckling (Joan Cusack). Abby isnt likely to turn into a swan (different fable). She is smart though constantly advising her pal that he and his dad need closure. Much of her barnyard psychology comes from ""Modern Mallard"" magazine. Instead of a heart-to-heart Chicken Little decides on a more improbable solution. He goes out for the baseball team. The outcome of this fowls ball might have been the end of the story and the movie. But no. Just when Dad and son can dance their celebratory funky dance a chunk of sky comes hurtling. An alien invasion that mixes ""E.T."" with ""War of the Worlds"" has anxious alien parents (Fred Willard and Catherine OHara) in a mad search for their three-eyed son. Underscore mad. More than a loving clever riff on a fable ""Chicken Little"" is a grade-school primer on the language of movies with a capital M. Written by Steve Bencich Ron J. Friedman and Ron Anderson this is an audience-building exercise Hook em young to the joys of genre to the ways of movie storytelling. Self-awareness abounds as ""Chicken Little"" zips from fable redux to underdog sports yarn to alien-invasion flick. Because all this genre-shifting occurs in less than 80 minutes you might worry the dash to climax is that of the proverbial chicken without its head. Its not. Theres enough sweet feed to nourish ideas about fathers and sons elementary school hierarchies and friendship. (Abby and Runts karaoke duet is a ridiculously cute return to the goofy generosity of the Spice Girls.) Of course the misfits are the stars of ""Chicken Little."" So another moral How unpopular can the unpopular kids be if the story is built around them tighter than a chicken coop? Some of the lessons and many of the gags are fine scratch for chaperones. ""You got to be ready to listen to your children"" says Buck (Garry Marshall). ""Even if they have nothing to say."" Will the booster-seat set get all the winks and lessons? More than some of us might think. The adult inside me laughed at Runts squeals (Id see it again just for Zahns ad libs) and fondness for disco. The wee ones around me guffawed at a repeated gag about playing dumb when avoiding responsibility. Who me? Who we talking about? They loved it when Chicken Little used it. They liked it even better when the father alien tried it out on his frustrated knowing wife. Probably they got the intergalactic notion of hen-pecked hubby. But what really tickled them was the aliens evasion.  | ""Chicken Little"" G |1 hour 18 minutes|CHICK FLICK|Directed by Mark Dindal; written by Steve Bencich and Ron J.

With the voices of Zach Braff Joan Cusack. (77 min.)Its finally happened. The Walt Disney Studio which pioneered hand-drawn animation has made its first fully animated computer feature ""Chicken Little."" Is the sky falling? No tears need be shed This fast and funny comedy which will be shown in digital 3-D in select theaters demonstrates that Disney can survive quite well without Pixar. The visuals are irrepressibly witty and so is the script which morphs from the classic fable into a spoof on ""War of the Worlds."" I prefer this version to Spielbergs. Grade A-The Passenger (PG-13)Director Michelangelo Antonioni. With Jack Nicholson Maria Schneider. (119 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""The Passenger"" Antonionis existential thriller from 1975 has steadily been building up its reputation over the years. Sony Classics which will release the DVD early next year has just brought out a newly restored theatrical version with six minutes of footage cut from the original US release. Nicholson plays a TV journalist in Africa who assumes the identity of a dead man. Maria Schneider fresh from ""Last Tango in Paris"" is the mystery woman. The films final seven-minute shot is one of the great denouements in film history. Grade A Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Still in releaseThe Legend of Zorro (PG)Director Martin Campbell. With Antonio Banderas Catherine Zeta-Jones. (100 min.)""The Legend of Zorro"" made me long to re-watch ""Zorro the Gay Blade"" the spoof starring George Hamilton. In that film the Spanish accents sound deliberately fake. Here even Banderas has a hard time sounding authentic. Zorros nemesis a French aristocrat plans to blow up America. He seems to be under the misapprehension that Zorro is James Bond. Grade C-Paradise Now (PG-13)Director Hany Abu-Assad. With Kais Nashef Ali Suliman. (90 min.)Said and his friend Khaled are recruited as human bombs by an underground Palestinian terrorist organization in the intermittently powerful ""Paradise Now."" Abu-Assad attempts - with mixed results - to get inside the psyches of men who would blow themselves up for the cause. Grade B+The Squid and the Whale (R)Director Noah Baumbach. With Laura Linney Jeff Daniels. (80 min.)Baumbachs semiautobiographical comedy has the freshness of firsthand observation. Its about the breakup of a self-infatuated novelist (a bearded Jeff Daniels) and his headstrong wife as seen through the eyes of their two sons. Baumbach captures the ways in which children take sides in a war they cant even begin to comprehend. Grade A- Next up Mistress America The dialogue and the characters should be sharper While Were Young is skimpy in its female characterizations Frances Ha star Greta Gerwig is always worth watching Print/Reprints About these ads Sponsored Content by LockerDome About these ads About these ads We want to hear did we miss an angle we should have covered?

"Chicken Little | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; chicken-little ) Chicken Little (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli With Chicken Little Walt Disneys in-house animation department has made the transition from hand-drawn to computer-drawn imagery. As debuts go this is not a stellar one. It is bogged down by many of the problems that have plagued Disneys recent traditional animated features anonymous voice work poor plot structure and the mistaken belief that the Disney brand will elevate anything to a ""must see"" level for viewers starved for family friendly fare. If theres a bright side to Chicken Little its that kids will love it. This is a classic ""childrens movie"" meaning theres an inverse ratio between age and appeal (the lower the age the higher the enjoyment quotient). To the filmmakers credit they try to shoehorn in some ""adult"" material (and I dont mean that in a prurient sense) - pop references kids wont get occasional moments of sly wit and a few vocal cameos. On the whole the movie left me less entertained than I expected to be. But theres no doubt the under-10 members of the audience loved it. As a result Chicken Little falls into the category of movies to attend with children but to avoid (at least in theaters) if youre an adult unencumbered by a pint-sized companion. Chicken Little takes a shot at seeming hip and fresh but its the kind of hipness one gets from a bunch of grown-ups trying to use the lingo of juveniles - vaguely embarrassing. Familiar pop tunes are force-fed to the audience relieving the filmmakers of the responsibility of generating any new musical numbers. (Are the lyrics of ""If You Wanna Be My Lover"" appropriate for a G-rated movie?) All of these things feel much like attempts to ratchet up the films level of accessibility to younger viewers. Just plain ""computer animation"" apparently is no longer seen as an impressive enough attraction. Shrek may have started this but the filmmakers at Dreamworks made it seem effortless; Disneys efforts are awkward at times. The story is simplistic. Chicken Little (voice of Zach Braff) becomes infamous when he creates a panic by claiming that ""the sky is falling."" It turns out to be a false alarm caused by an acorn. A year later after spending countless hours trying to bond with his father Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) Chicken Little has a close encounter of the third kind. Alongside him are his three best friends Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack) the ugly duckling; Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) an obese pig; and Fish Out of Water (Dan Molina) a walking fish wearing a divers helmet. An invisible spaceship is parked above the town hall possibly heralding an alien invasion. But when Chicken Little tries to alert the residents to the threat he is regarded as the bird who cried wolf. One aspect of the film that will play better to children than adults is the father/son bonding that occurs between Chicken Little and Buck Cluck. This subplot is scripted in an obvious manner. Bucks transformation is meant to give Chicken Little an emotional impact but it will only work for those who like characters feelings to be painted with wide brush strokes. I realize this is not supposed to have the character development of a French drama but this sort of thing was once Disneys strong suit (think back to movies like The Little Mermaid and The Lion King). Here it is done in a perfunctory manner. But it will hit home with the target audience. The voice work is disappointing. None of the leads excepting perhaps Joan Cusack leaves an impression. Zach Braff (of TVs Scrubs) presents as bland and unimaginative a ""plucky"" lead character as we have seen in recent animated movies. (Chicken Little was originally supposed to be played by Holly Hunter until Michael Eisner decided that a sex change was needed. Little boys dont like seeing animated movies with little girl leads or so common wisdom dictates.) The cameos from Patrick Stewart Don Knotts Patrick Warburton and Adam West (doing a William Shatner impersonation?) are noteworthy and it says a lot that these are the voices one remembers after the movie is over even though none of them has more than a handful of lines. Visually Chicken Little doesnt offer anything special. Seemingly designed to look a little like a computerized version of Looney Tunes the movie lacks the meticulous detail of many of its contemporaries. (The pioneering Toy Story now 10 years old looks better.) The backgrounds appear static and the main characters are designed to seem more like cartoon creations than the ""humanized animals"" of many recent computer animated movies. Some of that is unquestionably a conscious stylistic choice but the movie still looks cheap at times. (Note I am told the digitally projected 3-D version of this film is quite spectacular from a visual standpoint but only a small percentage of viewers will see the film in that format.) Director Mark Dindals previous movie was The Emperors New Groove and he brings the same genial tone to Chicken Little. The movie is funny at times although most of the successful humor occurs during the final half-hour. Its odd that Disney should have so much riding on a project that is cinematically speaking a lightweight. The bar for animated films has been falling this year (Corpse Bride and Wallace and Gromit both stop-motion pictures head 2005s class) and Chicken Little does nothing to raise it. If Disney is again going to rise to the top of a genre they ruled for decades theyre going to have to do better than this. Theres nothing in Chicken Little that should cause concern for either Dreamworks or Pixar.

Accordingly no conclusion will be drawn here about a sky-wide decline in Disneys storytelling capabilities based solely on the companys first direct bid to match the achievements of Pixar and DreamWorks. Instead focus will remain on the banality of the acorns dropped in this particular endeavor another in a new breed of mass-market comedy that substitutes self-reference for original wit and pop songs for emotional content. Production notes boast that Chicken Little himself (voiced by Scrubs Zach Braff with generic ebullience) is computer-clad in more than 76000 individual feathers but what the cluck do we care about erisimilitude of plumage when the issues between the scrawny hero and his father (Garry Marshall) are so derivative? Dads a single parent who at first doesnt believe in his son until the arrival of real danger ignored by the towns adults and squawk squawk squawk. The tech complexity employed to replicate muscle movement doesnt make up for the simplistic colorlessness of the characters -- including a recycled trio of fellow outsiders as Littles friends and a standard collection of naysayers and oddballs among his adversaries. Each represents a joke delivered before and better by Finding Nemo The Incredibles Shrek and the vast heaven of TV sitcoms. What falls in Chicken Little are hopes.

The first piece was Pixar with such movies as Toy Story and Monsters Inc. Another chunk was DreamWorks (the Shreks). And yes an outfit called Blue Sky fell too with Ice Age and Robots. Hand-drawn or 2-D animation was instantly kaput. Chicken Little was right. In a decade CG animation... To continue reading or Log-In Want the full story?

Under-nourishing and highly derivative fast-food item probably will ring up less B.O. than most of the high-flying animated features of recent holiday seasons. Disneys first inhouse all-CG animated feature ""Chicken Little"" lives up to its name by serving up a fraction of what audiences are used to getting in this department from Pixar and DreamWorks -- little originality little humor and little ingratiating characterization. Under-nourishing and highly derivative fast-food item probably will ring up less B.O. than most of the high-flying animated features of recent holiday seasons although the Disney imprimatur and marketing muscle still will send it on a highly profitable journey through every segment of its commercial playoff. Unprepossessing pic feels secondhand in all respects It spins off a tiresomely familiar fairy tale takes place in the sort of idealized small town thats long since come to feel shopworn references pop culture touchstones as laboriously as did ""Shark Tale"" spotlights a father-son dynamic that blandly echoes that of ""Finding Nemo"" is upfront in poaching from ""War of the Worlds"" for its dramatic climax and comes in a distant second to ""Jimmy Neutron"" in the coolness of its outer space gizmos and creatures. In short ""Chicken Little"" looks recycled inside and out. One could go further and say the film apes ""Ice Age"" in that the action hinges on an acorn or at least what appears to be one. Upon being beaned the diminutive and bespectacled title character (voiced by Zach Braff) who sports a large white head atop a wimpy torso throws the town of Oakey Oaks into a tizzy by insisting the heavens above are about to land upon the citizenrys heads. When this fails to come to pass the newly minted and pointedly unathletic social outcast determines to win his widower fathers respect by excelling at baseball. Pennant-deciding game fills up the first act in ho-hum fashion but doesnt resolve everything with dad (Garry Marshall Bronx accent conspicuous in context); that provokes one of Chicken Littles buddies the web-footed Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack) to go on in tedious jargon about finding ""closure"" and staging an ""intervention"" that no doubt will resonate deeply with all the 8-year-olds in the audience. Rounding out the scintillating group of central characters are a disturbingly overweight young porker named Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) whos into Streisand records and can be relied upon to overreact hysterically to all occurrences; and Fish Out of Water who wears a water-filled diving helmet (the reverse of Sandy in ""SpongeBob SquarePants"") and therefore cannot utter a single intelligible word. When flying saucers arrive and cough up aggressive robotic octopi with long thin tentacles there is legitimate concern that the local population and specifically dad may not believe the feathered pariahs warnings. It takes a while for everyone to figure out what the extraterrestrials are really up to but Chicken Littles role in resolving matters favorably is deemed sufficiently inspiring to warrant an elaborate bigscreen telling ""Chicken Little The True Story"" SRO preem of which serves as the final scene. Penned by the team of Steve Bencich and Ron J. Friedman who wrote Disneys pallid ""Brother Bear"" along with newcomer Ron Anderson the script aspires to ""Shrek""-like impudence and wit but cannot transcend its conventional thinking and attitudes on matters big and small. Borderline frantic pace resembles that of the directing-producing team of Mark Dindal and Randy Fullmers 2000 Disney feature ""The Emperors New Groove."" Visuals are bright without being distinguished while John Debneys eclectic score is all but overwhelmed by an avalanche of mostly 70s pop hits.
