With Al Pacino Robin Williams Hilary Swank. Directed by Christopher Nolan. Running time 118 mins. Rated R Nudity violence gore. 3 stars Detective Will Dormer hasnt slept in days. The midnight sun keeps pouring through his Alaska motel window and his eyes are starting to liquefy like melting stalagmites. Sleep deprivation his conscience and worries about the killer hes chasing take their toll on his judgment in the wily thriller ""Insomnia."" The pairing of Al Pacino as the bleary cop with Robin Williams as the cagey killer is an interesting choice one made no less surreal by setting the movie in Alaska (filmed in Vancouver actually) where the day literally never ends. Will has flown from Los Angeles to an arctic hamlet with his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) to bring some big-city expertise to a case in which a teenage girl was first murdered then bathed and groomed. You dont expect that kind of thing in the halibut capital of the far north. The LAPD partners also have brought a little bit of home with them some bad blood regarding office politics. So when Will accidentally shoots and kills Hap in a fogbound chase for the killer he fudges the facts and hopes it will all work out. Knowing that Williams plays the killer is not the spoiler you might think. ""Insomnia"" is not so much about the murder mystery as it is about Wills internal struggle with whats right and whats possibly okay. His dilemma is further intensified when the killer seeks him out and prods him like a devil on his shoulder. The movie is a remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name starring Stellan Skaarsgard. Christopher Nolan whose ""Memento"" mesmerized audiences by moving backward in time is the director. Again he works with a protagonist who is deeply troubled and whose mind needs constant kicking like a rusty engine. Pacino is masterful as the sharp-witted seen-it-all detective whose powers are being subsumed by his internal conflict. He has a brusque but not altogether unkind way with a local cop (Hilary Swank) who idolizes him. ""Arent you going to write that down?"" he asks after imparting some bit of wisdom and she flails for a pen before realizing hes putting her on. Williams seemingly desperate to atone for his shmaltzy work in movies like ""Patch Adams"" only occasionally shows flashes of the coldness he needs to play a potential serial killer. The flat cadence he has chosen sounds more pleading than manipulative although his characters desperate spin on things makes for a weird kind of logic. Redeeming herself after ""Affair of the Necklace"" Swank perks up the small role of the bright-eyed hometown cop. So eager for something interesting to do she finds it in the least expected place. Swank makes a convincing transition from overeager rookie to someone who no longer needs to take notes. By the end of the movie she is ready to impart a bit of her own wisdom.

Our movie studios routinely snap up the rights to elegant little foreign films then stuff the remakes so full of money that they lumber across the screen like gazelles force-fed to the size of hippopotamuses. You can hear the distant thud of hippo feet in the opening moments of Insomnia the remake of Erik Skjoldbjaergs creepy metaphysical thriller about a tormented policeman played by Stellan Skarsgard. Where that 1997 Norwegian picture began with a quick shot of clouds and Skarsgards slab-faced detective sitting inside an airplane cabin -- low-budget shorthand for air travel -- the Warner Bros. version gives its heros opening journey more sumptuous treatment aerial shots of a plane winging over glaciers and forests a fancy pontoon-landing outside a picturesque Alaskan village a greeting on the dock by local cop Hilary Swank. Oh yes and the detective has now been upgraded to Al Pacino who emerges from the plane with the ravaged vainglorious grandeur of an ancient Roman ruin. His character Will Dormer is a cartoonishly named LAPD detective whos been sent with his partner (Martin Donovan) to the backwater town of Nightmute (""Halibut fishing capital of the world"") to help solve the murder of a teenage girl. Although legendary for his crime-solving prowess Dormer is actually riddled with angst haunted by an internal-affairs inquiry back home and assailed by a sense of cosmic injustice that eats at his liver like a buzzard. His mood only gets bleaker when he screws up the investigation with lethal consequences. Trying to cover up his mistake Dormer finds himself enmeshed in a complicated game of cat-and-mouse with the girls murderer Walter Finch (Robin Williams) who insists theyre two of a kind innocent men whove accidentally become killers. Dormer isnt buying it but stewing in guilt and utterly unable to sleep in his thin-curtained hotel room -- the summer sun shines in Nightmute 23 hours a day -- he sinks into a profound exhaustion prey to his own unsleeping inner darkness. Insomnia was adapted by first-time screenwriter Hillary Seitz who manages to preserve what gave the original film its power -- gravity interiority and a sense of moral unease -- yet still endow the action with an enjoyable Hollywood sheen. She ratchets up the violence invents a much bigger role for the psycho-killer (he is Robin Williams after all) and laces the dialogue with an urban rawness that Pacinos rasp turns into a kind of weird poetry. (""Youre about as mysterious to me"" he snaps at one suspect ""as a blocked toilet is to a fuckin plumber."") Where Skarsgards hero gave off more than a whiff of sleaziness -- feeling up a jailbait witness eyeballing a young couple having sex -- Seitz knows how far she can make a star like Pacino morally ambiguous without wholly losing the mass audience as Sean Penn did with Jack Nicholson in The Pledge. Unlike the Norwegian cop whose inner demons were so deeply embedded within him that they seemed part of the gloomy DNA of the Scandinavian psyche Dormers conflicts are naked enough that he can eventually achieve the moment of redemption American films expect of their heroes.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm WITH INSOMNIA DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER NOLAN has shucked off the independent-film chrysalis inside which he made his cult hit Memento. I suspect that fans of that film and his 1998 British import Following may be a bit disappointed with this new movie a conventional thriller without any of the time-jump shenanigans that gave Memento its special kick -- nobody will feel the need to see this new movie twice. Of course whenever indie filmmakers leap to the studios you always worry that theyll be smothered by the bureaucracy (all those smug apparatchiks all those bossy prima donnas) and be forced to sacrifice what makes their work personal. Yet Im not sure that Nolan is nearly as distinctive a talent as Mementos gimmick made some people think. He seems not to be one of those filmmakers like David Lynch or the Coens whose every frame expresses an idiosyncratic artistic vision. Instead he recalls Steven Soderbergh (who co-produced this new film) in his honorable old-Hollywood knack for making entertainments geared to an intelligent audience. Nolan pulls off Insomnias big set pieces especially the scene in which Dormer chases Finch across a floating logjam sort of a real-life equivalent of the video game Frogger. But he also uses this crime story to explore his works preoccupations psychological disarray; shared guilt (Patricia Highsmithstyle doppelgangering) and the inescapable awareness that the past is often more alive than the present. In the world of Christopher Nolan memory is still as treacherous as nitroglycerin. Like Soderbergh Nolan is a terrific director of actors. Here he needed to be for the Pacino-Williams pairing could have easily turned into a WWF bout of overacting -- both mens default setting is Too Much. Nolan gets his two larger-than-life leads playing off each other in the same frame (which is something Michael Mann couldnt pull off in Heats pairing of Pacino and De Niro) and coaxes a melancholy turn from Pacino an icon of angst whose real strength has always been his capacity for eloquent silence His world-weary eyes make insomnia the merest of formalities. The movie also boasts an unexpectedly subtle performance from Williams whose increasingly crumpled face makes Robert Altmans long-ago casting of him as Popeye look positively visionary. Williams is an astonishing performer but in the past his attempts to play ordinary people came across as simulacrums of ordinariness in which he resembled an uncannily precise but heartless puppet. As Finch hes finally figured out how to play normal -- he actually appears saner than Dormer -- and the great joke is that hes playing a murderer. But while its a good piece of dramatic acting I still find myself curious about the casting. Why hire Robin Williams to play a down-to-earth-seeming guy when hundreds of other actors can do that without breaking a sweat? And if you do cast him as a psycho-killer why not unleash him and get the benefit of his improvisational genius? (Nothing he does in Insomnia is nearly as enjoyable as the moment on Conan last week when he tweaked the self-serious Pacino while impersonating Sean Penn in I Am Sam.) If Dormer and Finch incarnate differing degrees of guilt the burden of innocence is carried by eager policewoman Ellie Burr charmingly played by Swank who displays a genial looseness that has eluded her ever since winning her Oscar. Although not a huge role Officer Burr becomes the films moral center for she alone undergoes a real transformation from naivete to experience. She starts out worshiping Dormer for his righteous prowess but winds up discovering how easy it is to be compromised while acting in the name of good. IN THE END INSOMNIA TELLS THE STORY OF A detective who begins by investigating a horrible crime and winds up confronting his own guilty soul. Although the American remake spells everything out as the taut Norwegian version does not it still hews closely enough to the original that watching them back-to-back is strangely revealing. Indeed if you rent the video after viewing Nolans movie youll have the unexpected pleasure of seeing what it would be like if Europe got into the habit of taking big Hollywood star vehicles and remaking them with far smaller budgets and a far larger sense of what one dares put onscreen. For example In the original movie Skarsgards cop desperately needs a spent bullet to cover up his crime so he shoots a barking dog on the street and pulls the slug from its body. In the American version Dormer needs the same bullet but as he wanders down an alley he stumbles across a dead dog that somehow happens to have been conveniently placed in his path -- just so he has a carcass to fire into. ""I dont mind killing a cop"" you can almost hear Pacino rasping to the producers ""but Ill be damned if youre going to show me shooting a dog.""

The paperback crime novelist killed the high school girl he was ""mentoring."" There are no other plausible suspects; and besides Finch is sly -- but not shy -- with his confessional hints. The real puzzle is Did Will Dormer (Al Pacino) also commit murder? That is to say Did he with malice aforethought shoot his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) or was it an accident -- a snap shot in the fog as they were stalking Finch near the scene of his crime? This turns out to be a complex and interesting matter. And Insomnia turns out to be a worthy successor to director Christopher Nolans Memento which was last years most discussible hit. The new movie does not tell its story backward -- youre allowed only one gimmick that sensational per career. It is in fact a rather conventionally sometimes almost ploddingly developed narrative. The two cops are on loan from Los Angeles sent to tiny Nightmute Alaska to help an old pal the police chief solve the crime. They are though carrying some extra psychological baggage. Will is a great cop but has planted evidence to make his case against a child molester. Hap knows what happened and is going to talk to internal affairs thus destroying a legendary career. So Will has a motive to kill him. And -- this is the best part -- his judgment is clouded by sleep deprivation. It is summertime in this land of the midnight sun and the perpetual daylight induces in him the malady of the title. We will never know and he will never know whether Haps death was willful or accidental. Will of course concocts a plausible story blaming the lurking but at that point unidentifiable Finch for the second crime. He also plants exculpatory evidence to support this tale. Meantime the creepy Finch tries to lure him into a deal Finch wont talk about what he saw if Will joins him in pinning the original murder on an innocent kid. What we have here is your basic good-cop-bad-cop story except that those two characters are wrapped into one with Pacino giving one of his terrific tormented performances in the role -- impatient arrogant and in the long watches of the night almost pathetically vulnerable. Williams is also good -- an entrancing smoothy you can well imagine Will succumbing to. Hilary Swank represents rationality -- a smart inexperienced cop who deeply admires Will and cant quite believe the case she begins to develop against him. Finally the film represents a triumph of atmosphere over a none-too-mysterious mystery. Which is to say that Nolan -- remaking a 1997 Norwegian film adapted by Hillary Seitz -- makes you feel the end-of-the-earth bleakness of his setting makes you feel the way it can discombobulate people once they internalize it. Insomnia is not a spectacular moviegoing ""memento"" but it is thoughtful quietly disturbing proof of a young directors gift.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 24 2002 1048 AM Hard Days Night Insomnia sleepwalks through its plot yet still delivers a nerve-jangling jolt; plus About a Boy The Believer and Bartleby. By David Edelstein Pacino and Williams tussle in the land of the midnight sun Having missed the Norwegian film on which the new Al Pacino-Robin Williams thriller Insomnia (Warner Bros.) is based Im disqualified from making breezy remarks about the awkwardness of the American translation or the damaging impact of Hollywood stars on its fragile Norwegian mood. Damn. Ill just have to take it on its own terms--which is OK since its sensationally made and in patches pretty nerve-jangling. The young British director Christopher Nolan has quickly become a specialist in putting you inside the heads of men whose perceptions have been fractured. Last year it was the short-term-memory-impaired hero of Memento; this time its the increasingly exhausted Will Dormer (Pacino) a Los Angeles detective helping out on a murder case in northern Alaska where the sun in midsummer never fully goes down. As Stephen Sondheim once phrased it ""Perpetual sunset is rather an unsettling thing""--especially if like Dormer your guilty conscience would be enough to keep you awake even without all that invasive white light spilling in under the window shades. Dormer accidentally kills someone in the course of a fog-blanketed manhunt and for reasons too complicated to recount here impulsively blames the act on the suspect in the initial murder--the only witness as it turns out to what really happened. All night Dormer stares at the digital clock in his Alaskan motel room the silence broken by the occasional phone call from the murderer he came to hunt--a fellow insomniac who is now in effect his co-conspirator. Unable to see a way through his predicament Dormer essentially sleepwalks through the investigation while the young Alaskan cop (Hilary Swank) who reveres him begins to wake up to the fact that hes keeping something secret. Advertisement Insomnia gives Pacino the opportunity to spend two hours in a sort of electrified stupor--not much of a stretch actually since hes often simultaneously manic and zoned-out. An actor less weirdly self-encased might have had more surprises in him but few could have gone so far. At first he plays Dormer slightly crotchety his distracted manner and tenor rasp recalling Michael Moriarty in his Law amp; Order days. Then with lack of sleep his singsong begins to sound like iambic pentameter his groggy cadences become more distended yet. Pacino turns out to have many levels of stuporous-ness; when you think he cant sink any lower hes into the subbasement and then the sub-subbasement until you start to look around for the Phantom of the Opera. Director Nolan abets Pacino with a syntax both slurry and percussively splintered--the soundscape either too muffled or too sharp the white light stabbing. He and his hair-trigger editor Dody Dorn remove connective tissue from the chases so that youre always off balance the cuts coming a half-second before you expect them. Glimpsed quickly from behind surrounded by fog or scampering over rocks or logs the killer is like some eerie Yeti at the edge of consciousness. The climax is unbelievably clunky in construction yet its so explosively edited with split-second close-ups that recall the finale of Bonnie and Clyde (1967) that I forgot my disappointment until it had ended--when my disappointment returned but not too insistently. It should be said that beyond the ingenious insomniac doppelganger premise (borrowed) this is a lifeless script. Dormer is being hounded by an internal affairs officer in Los Angeles and through the phone you can hear this cowardly parasite sneer. The plot twists are rickety the revelations stock and the motives of the killer--especially in the hackneyed scenes leading up to the final shootout--baffling. It must have made more sense in Norwegian. I like Hilary Swanks sharp new haircut which makes her face seem less angular but the eager-beaver act that worked gangbusters in Boys Dont Cry (1999) is a little creepy without the ironic sexual role reversal. As a woman shes charisma-free. With a run-of-the-mill bad-guy actor playing chief suspect Walter Finch the movie might have tipped too far Pacinos way. But Robin Williams is a shockingly effective counterweight. The key is what he doesnt do Those rubber features remain rigid that madcap energy harnessed. The sour little curl of Williams mouth reminds me of Laurence Olivier in The Entertainer (1960)--all the paranoid alertness of a stand-up comic with none of the genial pandering. There is nothing so despairing--or potentially so lethal--as a clown who has given up hope of making us laugh but wants to have an impact on us anyway. Rachel Weisz pulls Hugh Grant to the mainland Advertisement I havent heard many unsparkling words on the subject of About a Boy (Universal Pictures) an adaptation of Nick Hornbys second novel and Im not about to add any--its irresistible damn it. Mainstream comedies should all be this funny and tender and deftly performed. It opens with a thesis that can be easily dynamited--an assertion by its rich lazy narcissistic protagonist Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) that all men are John Donne notwithstanding islands and that his island happens to be a paradise. Wills sleazy attempt to exploit the sexual needs of single moms leads him in a roundabout way to the movies other protagonist a friendless fatherless 12-year-old geek called Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) whose most fervent desire is to connect with someone beside his glum suicidal mom (Toni Collette). Wills drive to be a free man is just as strong as Marcus to be attached but the comic standoff is ultimately settled by John Donne whose sentiments on the subject of men and islands are not--no surprise--to be sneezed at. Three things account for much of the movies charm. The first is Hugh Grant who adds nothing new to his virtuoso repertoire of self-conscious tics and stammers but who has become savvy enough to search out ironic contexts for them The adorably boyish act is not just Grants its Wills and it threatens to imprison this Freeman in a solipsistic cocoon. The second is that the gags all bloom out of the characters loneliness--they have unexpected emotional heft. Last the script (by Peter Hedges and directors Chris and Paul Weitz) does a phenomenal job of weaving narration in and out of dialogue. Students of screenwriting should study this hard. Unlike the writers of the last Hornby adaptation High Fidelity (2000) these guys know the difference between a public and a private utterance and why the two arent interchangeable. That knowledge means everything in a movie in which the chasm between what people permit themselves to say to one another and what theyre actually thinking is the source of all the comedy--and the terror of isolation too. I would hate to have to diagram the emotional trajectory of Danny (Ryan Gosling) the prodigiously conflicted protagonist of Henry Beans The Believer (Fireworks Pictures). Hes a Jew who becomes a Jew-stomping Nazi skinhead and then drifts in spite of himself back to Jewish ritual--desperately trying to rationalize his attraction to Torah and tefillin from a Nazi perspective. First he tells his fellow skinheads (who have no idea hes actually an ex-yeshiva boy) that one has to understand Jews to be able to destroy them; then he decides that the easiest way to destroy them would be to embrace and assimilate them--thus robbing them of their traditional outsider/victim roles. Confused? Not as much as Danny. By the end he has abstracted himself into oblivion. Finally showing up in theaters after a short run on Showtime The Believer was inspired by a real Ku Klux Klansman who when exposed by a reporter as a Jew committed suicide. But the movie leaves the realm of docudrama in the first second and rarely looks back. Its clear early on that Danny is so obsessed with his victimization that he has chosen to identify with the anti-Semitic aggressor. What is less clear--but remains tantalizing--is why Danny is also obsessed with the Genesis tale of God forcing Abraham to sacrifice his son Isaac and its connection to the story of a Holocaust survivor who watched with horrified passivity as his young boy was murdered by the Nazis. My guess is Danny has some Daddy issues that Bean doesnt fully explore; instead he concentrates on the uneasy relationship between the young Nazi and a group of soft-spoken fascists (led by Billy Zane and Theresa Russell) who have mainstream political ambitions. Somewhere in all this confusion are a bunch of FBI informers and the daughter (Summer Phoenix) of a likely ex-Nazi who sleeps with Danny and is in no time reading Hebrew and lighting Shabbos candles. I confess I dont fully understand Dannys (or the movies) zigs and zags but I was glued to the thing anyway--it has an inexplicable inner logic--and I admire Bean for refusing to settle into any easy groove. Theres an angry searching spirit behind The Believer that transcends its particulars It might be the most honest attempt Ive seen in a movie to explore the sadomasochistic impulses that attach themselves to victimhood. And Ryan Gosling is enthrallingly good. Unlike the skinhead played by Edward Norton in American History X (1998) who was alternately a ropy sneering sociopath and a conscience-riddled do-gooder there are no seams in Goslings Danny. His fantasies of murdering and being murdered are all part of the same unholy roller coaster--and you see the terror in his eyes on the big dips. Paymer and Glover bring Melville to the modern office building Many of us have experienced Herman Melvilles devastating Bartleby the Scrivener as a tale of woe the story of a depressive copyist whose polite but firm refusal to be a cog in the capitalist machine drives his heretofore mechanical employer to genuine despair. The neat thing about Jonathan Parkers modern-day Bartleby (Outsider Pictures) is that it brings out all the vaudeville undercurrents in Melvilles dark tale and turns it into a surreal tragi-sitcom for our own era. The original Wall Street setting is now an isolated exurban office complex furnished in mismatched 60s colors (avocado tangerine) on a hill above a landscape threaded with freeways; the office workers are a crack ensemble of loons among them Maury Chaykin as a slobbola Glenne Headley as a loosey-goosey office manager and Joe Piscopo as a desperately flashy lady-killer. Bartleby is played by Crispin Glover whose stammering Martian schtick--abetted on the soundtrack by a theremin--finally feels at home. As the boss David Paymer anchors the slapstick and low comedy. One of the most gifted supporting players in Hollywood Paymer at last has a chance to show that the determined squirt he usually plays doesnt have to be smaller-than-life--that even an unimaginative bureaucrat can say to the universe ""Sir I exist"" SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Comments Insomnia A gaunt Al Pacino stars as an LA police detective dispatched to northern Alaska to solve the murder of a high school girl in this psychological thriller by Christopher Nolan (Memento). The pressure of the investigation and the midnight sun keep Pacino awake and after he snaps kills his partner and hides the evidence hes blackmailed by a psychotic pulp novelist (Robin Williams) who befriended the girl. Screenwriter Hillary Seitz adapted a 1997 Norwegian feature sticking close to the original plot but heightening the similarities between cop and suspect (a fairly conventional ploy at this point). Nolan uses visual pyrotechnics to pump up the tension and add to Pacinos sense of disorientation but the feeling he evokes isnt as forlorn creepy or ambiguous as in the original (though the mountain wilderness is just as forbidding). Pacino is typically excitable but also strangely sad as if the case could take all hes got; Williams on the other hand tries playing against type but still goes over the top. With Hilary Swank Martin Donovan and Maura Tierney. 118 min.

The story takes place in small-town Alaska during summer when the midnight sun makes shut-eye hard to come by for Will Dormer (Al Pacino) a Los Angeles detective who has arrived somewhat improbably to help solve a local murder. But Wills deeper problem is moral decay. He cant get his zs because of his own conduct in investigating the case; he comes to feel as culpable in his way as the killer hes trying to find. In one sense Mr. Pacino is an odd casting choice; the gaunt-faced star already looks sleep-deprived on arrival. But he does bring star power to the role while Robin Williams plays the villain with an intensity thats all the scarier for being subdued. The film was directed by Christopher Nolan who did the remarkable ""Memento."" This one is nowhere near as original -- its a flawed remake of a fine first feature from Norway -- but ""Insomnia"" still stands on its own as a thriller with brains and scenic beauty. I must confess that I was partial to the production from the start for bringing Mr. Nolan into Hollywoods mainstream even as the director of a remake; the studios desperately need filmmakers of his skill intelligence and commitment. And I was fascinated by the darkly intricate symbiosis that develops between Dormer the compromised cop (whose surname suggests sleep in Italian or French) and his quarry Walter Finch a twisted novelist whos morally blind to his perversions. The good cast includes Hilary Swank as a perceptive local cop Martin Donovan as Dormers partner and Maura Tierney as a hotel manager who improbably once again becomes Dormers confessor. Yet ""Insomnia"" also sheds light on whats wrong with the studio system. Take a look at the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name which is readily available on a splendid Criterion DVD and youll find a low-budget psychological thriller starring Stellan Skarsgard thats lean laconic and entirely convincing. Next look at the credits for the remake -- four producers and five executive producers not to mention countless studio executives -- to get a sense of how many conflicting opinions Mr. Nolan and his first-time screenwriter Hillary Seitz must have had to contend with. Then see the mixed results of all that input in the new film an elaborate back story about Dormers checkered past that clutters the present; a silly exaggeration of the detectives acumen to justify his being played by a star (Dormer is so good that Ms. Swanks rookie cop reveres him); and a melodramatic climax whose main virtue lies in giving the hero a good line. Not all of the changes are for the worse. The back story does confer an intriguing ambiguity on Dormers motives which I cant discuss without spoiling several surprises. But less truly can be more even if the concept is anathema to the studios with their overloaded star vehicles. Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron At one point in ""Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron"" a magnificent animated feature from DreamWorks the stallion leaps across a gaping chasm in a display of power grace and courage that left me gaping with amazement and gasping with joy. The people who made this film have rediscovered the emotion in pure motion. And theyve made two remarkable leaps of their own -- back to hand-drawn animation although with elaborate computer assists and away from talking-creature cuteness. The animals here are mercifully mute. (The humans dont say much either.) Yes we glean the stallions thoughts -- hes actually a wild mustang living a century or so before those last descendants in ""The Misfits"" -- from a notably spare first-person narration given voice by Matt Damon. But ""Spirit"" evokes through its poetic spirit the mysterious power of silent film. One sequence after another (Ill get to the plot in a moment) bursts with graphic energy a lyrical opening that follows an eagles flight through red-rock canyons to a prairie full of wild horses running free (thats the plot running free); elemental combat between the stallion and a cavalry colonel who vows to tame him; Spirit plunging into perilous white-water rapids; a vast forest fire; a locomotives calamitous fall down a mountainside as Spirit gallops frantically to get out of its way (horse pursued by iron horse). Theres more to the plot of course in a movie that celebrates wild mustangs as the spirit of the Old West. (""Spirit"" is among other things an exciting Western.) Theres an alliance between the stallion and a young Lakota brave named Little Creek. Theres equine love between Spirit and Little Creeks paint mare Rain. And at the core of the drama theres a conflict between unspoiled nature and encroaching humankind as represented mainly by the U.S. Cavalry. (My only reservation concerns the portrayal of those troops whose arrival was ritually cheered by earlier generations of moviegoers. Here runaway revisionists have cast the cavalry as veritable Cossacks.) But the essence of this film isnt conventional narrative or who did what to whom and what happened next. Its classic animation wedded to modern technology -- painted pictures that move in magical splendor. Space Station 3D For another soul-filling experience at the movies find one of the many IMAX theaters (www.imax.com) around the country where ""Space Station 3D"" is currently playing. Ive been an IMAX apostle ever since my first giant-screen encounter and the mediums debut at Expo 67 in Montreal. When these films are good theres nothing like them -- images so big that the proscenium frame disappears images so vivid that youre taken out of yourself and into the action. IMAX films like any other can be lackluster apart from their size -- too many mundane travelogues pumped up to fit the format -- but ""Space Station 3D"" lacks neither luster nor grandeur. I heard kids and adults alike going ""Omigod Omigod"" all around me and the only reason I didnt join in the chorus was that I had to concentrate on taking notes. I also saw my theater-mates goggle-eyed as I was behind 3-D goggles reaching out to touch objects afloat in the zero gravity of the International Space Station -- a small Maglite bits of debris an orange a razor multicolored Mamp;Ms pieces of popcorn (aboard the station not in the theater). One of the wonders of this medium is its ability to switch between exquisite intimacy and ineffable vastness. In its intimate mode ""Space Station"" which is narrated by Tom Cruise puts you almost nose to nose with the astronauts in their cramped quarters; thus the touchless palpability of all those objects within virtual reach. But oh the power of the IMAX cameras when they venture into the cosmic void where up and down give way to endless outness and our planet is a place apart. One of the astronauts in ""Space Station"" starts feeling homesick for Earth before she leaves it. Thats something even we can begin to grasp during this truly transporting film but its a sickness Id gladly risk if I had the chance. Chances are against most of us having it of course. On the line that has already formed for rides into space fares are so high that only the super rich can afford a seat. After ""Space Station 3D"" though Ill be watching Priceline.com with special interest.  DVD TIP If ever a movie needed to be re-viewed and studied carefully its ""Memento"" which played in theaters two years ago. To play it in Columbia TriStars snazzy two-disc set however you cant just hit the Play button. Like the memory-challenged hero Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) you must consult a memo find the correct key word select it and then press Enter. Its all very playful and inventive as befits this singular thriller though sometimes quite maddening. To access the many features of the second disc you must work your way through a sequence of tasks and mindbenders designed by Mr. Nolan. I finally managed to do it but I cant remember how.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A gimmick is only a gimmick if its in service of nothing but its own gimmickry. The big twist in Christopher Nolans astonishing Memento-a thriller that unfolds in reverse chronological order-is that the gimmick suddenly melts away revealing a deeply considered and profound statement about the slippery nature of memory and the human capacity for self-deception. So it only follows that Nolans next project a compelling big-budget remake of the superb Norwegian ""sunlit noir"" Insomnia would segue smoothly (and in reverse anatomical order no less) from memory to perception relishing the sometimes fuzzy connection between the eyes and the mind. Those who arent familiar with Erik Skjoldbjaergs original will likely be immune to the remakes biggest flaw which is the disappointing suspicion that Nolan for all his talent and craft never came up with a reason for the remake other than to translate a great film into English and introduce it to a wider audience. But while his additions and subtractions are negligible the premise still carries an ingenious metaphorical hook centering on a man whose guilty conscience can never escape the light of day. In a role originally played by the much younger Stellan Skarsgard Al Pacino looks haggard; his world-weary demeanor speaks volumes about his character a veteran L.A. detective assigned to investigate the murder of a high-school student in small-town Alaska. As an internal-affairs unit prepares to mount a corruption case against him back home Pacino and partner Martin Donovan track a methodical killer during summer in the Arctic Circle under perpetual sunlight. A ruse to snare the suspect pays off but a shootout on a foggy beach ends with Pacino accidentally shooting Donovan and then hastily covering it up worried that his partners cooperation in the internal-affairs case will make him the obvious culprit. While a local officer (Hilary Swank) collects evidence for a report on the incident the sole witness (Robin Williams in his best performance in about 18 years) blackmails Pacino to save his own hide. As Pacino endures day after day without a wink of sleep Insomnia skillfully turns the screws delving further into his troubled mind as its haunted by past and present sins as well as deceptive visions that seem to bleed out of his conscience. Nolans solid workmanlike direction doesnt strike any memorable grace notes but he draws out the key ambiguities in the story with great precision to the point where even Pacino himself isnt certain whether the shooting was an accident. Long on atmospherics and short on plot the original Insomnia drifts so far away from the initial murder investigation that it nearly becomes incidental to the real story about a crooked man deprived of the darkness he needs to conceal his secrets. Nolan reverses the emphasis-;no surprise from the director of a plot-driven film like Memento-but achieves the same end bringing Hollywood noir under the harsh glare of permanent daylight.

"Insomnia will keep you up reliving plot twists | CJOnline.com Toggle navigation Home News Local Business Sports Weather Subscribe Obits Classifieds Classifieds Local Jobs Homes Search Insomnia will keep you up reliving plot twists Insomnia Rated R for language some violence and brief nudity the film opens today at the West Ridge 8 Posted Friday May 24 2002 By By David GermainThe Associated Press This weekend marks the traditional start to Hollywoods big summer season yet we have already had two of summers biggest blockbusters (""Spider-Man"" and ""Star Wars"") and two rock-solid ""counterprogramming"" films for adults (""Unfaithful"" and ""About a Boy""). Photos Now comes counterprogrammed triumph No. 3. ""Insomnia"" Christopher Nolans follow-up to the indie smash ""Memento"" is an inventive crime thriller with startling twists macabre humor and spellbinding performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams who plays against type as a heartless killer. From a simple tale of murder in an Alaskan town in summer when the sun never sets Nolan crafts an intricate house of cards that is the sort of film to keep you up an hour past bedtime pondering the internal machinations of both good guys and bad guys. Adapted from a 1997 Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgard ""Insomnia"" is dark and grim with a desolate sense of place and a melancholy air reminiscent of the moody character studies of the 1970s. ""Insomnia"" would fit snugly into a triple-bill alongside Francis Ford Coppolas ""The Conversation"" and Pacinos ""Dog Day Afternoon."" Nolan has greatly improved on the fitfully engaging original a spare cloistered film that was mostly surfaces with few insights into the characters troubled interiors. The remake is expansive the Alaska settings (mostly shot in British Columbia) providing a spooky backdrop whose harsh grandeur dwarfs the characters illuminating the smallness the baseness of their motivations and actions. While remaining true to the basic framework of the Norwegian version screenwriter Hillary Seitz deftly fleshes out the principals. The back story of Pacinos character in particular -- a big-shot Los Angeles detective who almost but not quite escaped the sort of corruption that has scandalized that citys police force -- adds real-life relevance and enriches his descent into guilt and culpability as events play out. Pacino adds another memorable cop role to his resume as detective Will Dormer dispatched with his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) to the northern Alaska community of Nightmute to help solve the murder of a 17-year-old girl. Will is idolized by novice Nightmute police officer Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) whose hero worship erodes as she investigates the shooting death of Hap in heavy fog during a stakeout to catch the murderer. The presumption is Hap was gunned down by the killer who escapes. As evidence accumulates Ellie begins to doubt Wills sincerity. As prime suspect Walter Finch a murder-mystery writer Williams doesnt pop up until almost halfway into the film. Will and Finch quickly forge an odd frightening bond of complicity the detective caught in circumstances that leave him torn between pursuing and protecting the killer. Williams revels -- and excels -- in this turn to the dark side twisting the manic energy of his best comedic roles to create a loathsomely compelling and calculating villain. Swank displays solid intensity in her limited role and Maura Tierney as manager of the local hotel shares a searing moment with Pacino near the end of Wills crash-and-burn cycle. The highlight is Pacino who gives his best performance in years as Will subtly comes unglued amid grief over Haps death discomfiture with his relationship as Finchs accessory and mental fuzziness caused by inability to sleep in a land where darkness never falls. From the outset the movie establishes how far out of his element this super-cop has wandered. When Will barks that he wants to immediately visit the local high school to question a teen-age suspect he is momentarily confused when Ellie tells him it is 10 oclock. She has to qualify her comment 10 oclock at night.

Then a disastrous stakeout leaves Dormer guilty and fearful for his liberty. Worse he starts receiving blackmail calls from crime novelist and prime suspect Walter Finch (Williams). The midnight sun meanwhile is depriving Dormer of sleep clouding his judgment. If all this may sound familiar its because Hillary Seitzs subtle script improves on the 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name. Despite its linear storyline the film is very recognisably the work of the sharp probing intelligence that gave us Following and Memento. While it succeeds as an extremely stylish gripping thriller its also another of the directors takes on life as narrative. Dormers dealings with Hap and Finch are about who can come up with a story others will swallow. The better your tale the greater your control. Poor Dormer however disoriented in every sense no longer distinguishes so clearly between means and motive cause and effect. This like the uniformly terrific acting (especially from Pacino and Williams) lends welcome nuance and depth to the ethical enquiry while furnishing the drama with dark telling ironies and intriguing ambiguity.

While it may not be as stylistically idiosyncratic as ""Memento"" ""Insomnia"" is a gripping highly dramatic thriller that more than confirms the distinctive talent of young Brit helmer Christopher Nolan. Working from an edgy 1997 Norwegian sleeper hit of the same name Nolan and scenarist Hillary Seitz have fashioned a probing psychological study of a flawed cop that has stimulated Al Pacino to his best performance in many years. Beautifully filmed on striking British Columbian locations (subbing for Alaska during summers midnight sun) this precision-tooled suspenser looms as a solid summer performer for Warner Bros. Erik Skjoldbjaergs original film a fest discovery and specialized-release fave five years ago featured Stellan Skarsgard as a seasoned Swedish homicide detective called to a small town in Norway to help solve a vexing case involving the murder of a high school girl. Among pics key components were the focus on the cops clever use of devious means to produce the desired end the imposition of big city ways on the more relaxed manner of the village locals and the perpetual bright sky of the far north that pushed its protagonist beyond mere sleep deprivation to hallucinatory levels of physical and spiritual fatigue. All of these elements have been preserved in this first-produced screenplay by Seitz who has faithfully followed the dramatic line of the previous films first half significantly elaborated the second and deepened the emotional and moral inquiry wherever possible. Only in one important case of casting and performance does the picture fall short of full realization. Happy for a brief reprieve from the prying eyes of an internal affairs investigation on his L.A. home turf star cop Will Dormer (Pacino) arrives by seaplane along with partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) at the exquisitely situated burg of Nightmute. There hes greeted with unabashed admiration by local officer Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) who has studied her idols cases in school. Dormer has been called in because the small-towners are stumped by the killers fastidiousness; whoever murdered the 17-year-old Kate carefully washed her hair clipped her nails and otherwise made sure to leave behind no traces. What the locals consider stumbling blocks however Dormer views as clues in themselves and he skillfully sets a trap for the killer to lure him to the remote cabin where the body was found. The ruse works and but for a blunder by a backup cop Dormer would have had his man. But in the ensuing chase the presumed murderer vanishes across slippery rocks into the thick fog which leads Dormer to take an ill-advised shot that ends up killing his partner with whom hes recently had a hot argument. Dormers quick-thinking and trickery convinces the other cops that the hunted man actually nailed Eckhart which frees him to pursue the case through more laborious means but also leaves him burdened with terrible guilt. Even at this early stage the modest changes wrought on the original enrich the remake; the character of the partner in the earlier version was an older man; making him younger with wife and kids whom Dormer knows well significantly ratchets up the emotional impact of his death on Dormer and the audience. Nolans attention to detail and intense skill with actors are apparent even in the fleeting performance of the unseen actress (Kerry Sandomirsky) who superbly gives voice to Eckharts wife as she learns over the phone from Dormer that shes now a widow. Although the Nightmute police think they have a good suspect in Kates arrogant boyfriend Dormer figures differently certain that Kate visited a secret ""admirer"" after partying with friends on the night of the murder. Repeated phone messages from a man who claims he saw Dormer shoot Eckhart and insists that ""Were partners in this"" confirm Dormers suspicions and hes soon able to figure out who the killer is and where he lives. Its giving away nothing to reveal that the culprit is Walter Finch (Robin Williams) a mystery writer Kate befriended. After surviving a frantic chase highlighted by a brilliantly rendered sense of suffocation when Dormer is trapped underwater beneath some enormous floating logs the detective agrees to a meeting on a ferry where Finch launches the mind games that mount between the two men. Shrewd and well-versed in the ways of the criminal mind Finch uses what he knows of Dormers troubles to suggest they can help one another while all Dormer cares about is putting this creep away. Their initial encounter which occurs at the beginning of pics second half is admirably performed sotto voce and at key moments Nolan wisely lets the camera just sit and record long exchanges in a single take. Script takes advantage of Dormers moral predicament and Finchs tight squeeze to explore the psychological ambiguity of the mens mutual involvement. But while Finch never achieves the stature of a truly memorable villain Dormers tragic complexity stemming from his time-tested ability to ""know"" when someone is guilty places the character at least in the same ballpark with Orson Welles memorable portrait of the brilliant corrupt cop Hank Quinlan in ""Touch of Evil."" Just when the prospect of seeing Pacino play yet another cop might not seem that exciting he delivers an exceptionally textured performance that quietly reveals the characters ample talents while drawing upon unexpected resources of emotional truth. The process of prolonged sleep deprivation -- initially treated rather comically as Dormer is unable to keep the light from streaming into his hotel room but finally pushing him to dementia -- serves as a wonderful device by which the characters essence is finally illuminated. This is the third film in a row after the Sundance entry ""One Hour Photo"" and the recent flop ""Death to Smoochy"" in which Williams has played a bad guy and while the act may be interesting the first time you see it its revealed as a one-dimensional stunt upon repeated exposure. This time playing an emotionally pinched loner with a hair-trigger temper Williams consistently uses a calmly clenched demeanor to express repressed evil in the evident conviction that underplaying will pay dramatic dividends. But the necessary emotional and psychic turbulence fails to come through and the lack of a genuinely insinuating and imposing dramatic actor to balance Pacino is the only thing holding the picture back. Playing a ""normal"" modern woman for a change Swank adroitly registers the swing of Ellies regard for Dormer once she begins suspecting what hes up to. Donovan works well with Pacino in giving life to the partners complicated feelings for one another during his brief screen time and Maura Tierneys role as the operator of the lodge where Dormer stays keeps threatening to become more than it does. Wally Pfisters muscular widescreen lensing makes the most of the magnificent locations Dody Dorns editing is unobtrusively lean and David Julyans music supports the story with turbulent inflections.

Strangely he didnt say much in The Importance of Being Earnest  his most popular and enduring comedy and a lot of what he did say is regretfully missing from the glossy new movie version by Oliver Parker the same writer-director who put a fresh coat of varnish on Wildes An Ideal Husband . Despite the many liberties he takes to adapt Wildes arch style and dialogue to a movie for mass consumption the delicious cast and a lot of cinematic ""opening up"" (gilt-edged theaters posh cafes jazzy music the lush green English countryside and even a tattoo parlor) conspire to turn a classic Victorian drawing-room comedy of manners into an enjoyable romp. Alas it still pales in comparison to Anthony Asquiths famous 1952 film version. Purists will insist that Mr. Asquiths dry stagy eccentric but riotous film was the definitive one. Mr. Parkers spin is so busy that it assumes a chirpy tempo of its own more in keeping with the demands of modern audiences but it loses a lot of the wit attitude and elegance of Wildes subtle mastery of the language. And no matter how hard they try to knock themselves out being frisky and charming the new cast cant hold a candle to Michael Redgrave Joan Greenwood Dorothy Tutin Michael Denison Margaret Rutherford and especially Dame Edith Evans titanic aria as the maddeningly eccentric Lady Bracknell. Still let us leave that landmark film in its resting place preserved in memory and on the shelves of video stores and concentrate on the 2002 remake. It offers pleasures of its own. Say what? Despite numerous Broadway revivals and even a musical version called Ernest in Love  you dont remember what The Importance of Being Earnest is about? Utter silliness thats what. The fanciful plot-which even in 1895 gave new meaning to the word ""contrived""-is a farce concerning two dashing irresponsible London bachelors who both assume the name Ernest to woo the objects of their confused affections. Country squire Jack Worthing (Colin Firth) seeks the hand of the genteel but impulsive Gwendolen (Frances OConnor) and comes to town to propose but since she has always been attracted to the virility of the name Ernest he passes himself off as a fictitious younger brother of the same name. Meanwhile his arrogant vain extravagant cad of a pal Algernon Moncrieff (Rupert Everett) also posing as Jacks brother Ernest heads for the country to romance Jacks 18-year-old ward Cecily (Reese Witherspoon with a brilliant and unaffected British accent that never falters). Clearly its impossible for them to be in the same place at the same time. They cant both be Ernest although both ladies mistakenly think theyre engaged to the same man. A high point of the film occurs when the willful Gwendolen and the angelic Cecily pool their feminine wiles to bring their men to heel. Meanwhile the delicate sauce of a plot thickens to pudding when the imperious Lady Bracknell Gwendolens mother and Algernons aunt dismisses Jack as a suitable candidate for her daughters hand because he was a foundling abandoned as an infant in a handbag in Victoria Station. When everyone descends unexpectedly upon Jacks country manor mistaken identities are revealed scandals erupt and chaos ensues. The mystery of Jacks birth is also solved but not before Judi Denchs Lady Bracknell-precise intolerant and snobbish to the manner born-has a cherished moment of regal hilarity when she looks down her nose and declares ""To lose one parent ... may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness."" She is fine and God knows she can act but to hear Dame Edith Evans say that same line in the 1952 film is to feel suddenly the full impact of Oscar Wildes treacherous wit and wisdom and the weight too of Victorian class-consciousness circa 1895. There are splendid turns by Anna Massey as Cecilys pickled tutor Miss Prism Edward Fox as Algernons long-suffering underpaid butler and Tom Wilkinson as the local rector who timidly pursues the sullen Miss Prism. What a tribute to his diversity and range. Curiously Mr. Wilkinson also appeared as the beastly violent homophobic Marquess of Queensberry who was responsible for Oscar Wildes downfall and imprisonment for ""gross indecency"" in the excellent biopic Wilde . Now hes here playing one of Wildes shy little subsidiary characters with an amour fou of his own. Wilde might have enjoyed the newfangled camera work and even the jazz duet performed by Mr. Firth and Mr. Everett (unnecessary to the plot and utterly anachronistic) but I doubt he would have approved of the added bit where the ladylike Gwendolen has ""Ernest"" tattooed on her bum. Oscar Wilde aimed for truth over illusions. The eye candy in Oliver Parkers version seems to favor style over sincerity. The film is a fragile frolic but the real theme enjoyed by countless audiences through the years-the importance of being earnest instead of deceitful in matters of the heart-still shines through the frosting. Pacino Blinks in The Midnight Sun Insomnia is a dark purple scar on the noirish landscape of psychological thrillers with Al Pacino giving a creepy but mesmerizing centerpiece performance as a detective who discovers while investigating the savage murder of a 17-year-old girl that hes more disturbed than the killer. Directed by Christopher Nolan whose pretentious and confusing Memento ended up on a few 10 Best lists last year Insomnia is a more conventional remake of a 1997 Norwegian film of the same name. Its a great improvement over Memento  but when it comes to cops fighting their inner demons in the line of duty it never achieves anything like the quality of Sean Penns vastly superior film on the same theme The Pledge . Still theres this to say It beats the hell out of the cyclone of Hollywood thrillers weve been getting lately. Mr. Pacino plays a famous homicide cop from L.A. who accompanied by his younger partner (Martin Donovan) arrives in the frozen wastes of Alaska to solve the brutal murder of a local high-school girl. The nervous conflict between the two detectives is palpable seems the internal-affairs department of the LAPD is about to ruin Mr. Pacino for planting evidence in an earlier case and Mr. Donovan is on the verge of cutting a deal to clear himself of all charges. Driven by guilt fear and resentment Mr. Pacino is forced to go through the motions of solving a crime while trying to figure out how to save his own career. With all that nervous stress in a place where there is no nightfall its no wonder he doesnt sleep for seven days. The irony of fate descends during a chase through a blinding fog when he shoots and kills his partner in what may or may not be an accident then hides his gun and pretends he thought he was aiming at the murder suspect. Nobody challenges him especially not Hilary Swank as the rookie Alaskan cop who idolizes him. For a solid hour it seems like a routine case-routine clues routine evidence routine questioning routine suspects-and a routine movie. In fact the first hour of Insomnia is so slow it guarantees a sure cure for its own title. Then the pulse quickens and the pace picks up with the appearance of Robin Williams playing against type as an eccentric writer of mystery novels who baits Mr. Pacino with the maniacal cleverness of one of his own pulp-fiction plots. Hes the killer and Mr. Pacino knows it. But hes also the only witness to see Al shoot his partner. Now its a case of two killers stalking each other outsmarting each other and making deals to clear each other-but Mr. Pacino is the one with insomnia. The midnight sun keeps him up and part of the fascination for two hours is watching him disintegrate. Bug-eyed and pasty as gravy he has never looked so wasted. I mean he always looks wasted but in Insomnia he looks like a corpse waiting for an open-casket viewing. Naturally its up to the smart lady cop to discover the truth in a blazing three-way shoot-out that wipes out everybody with more than three pages of dialogue. No wonder Mr. Pacinos last line before he loses consciousness is ""Just let me sleep."" I wasnt sure if he meant in a bed or on a slab at the morgue but I identified completely. Insomnia doesnt generate much tension. Its laid-back and talky with everybody reacting to each other in tight punishing close-ups; its too measured and restrained for its own good. The crime is as dull as a rusty hinge and theres no suspense in finding the identity of the killer. Eschewing the violence in the Norwegian film director Nolan treats the repellent aspects of the murder itself with an almost detached discretion. At least the story isnt told backwards as in Memento . And the chilly atmosphere forged by the icy camera work of Wally Pfister does create a sustained mood of blue melancholia that makes an already unstable cops confrontations with his dark side seem doubly daunting. The miscast Hilary Swank looks as uncomfortable and out-of-place in a cops uniform as she did in the French period gowns of The Affair of the Necklace . Was that Oscar for Boys Dont Cry a mistake or does she just need a new agent? Martin Donovan as the partner who exits early in a body bag and Maura Tierney as the sympathetic manager of the lodge where the cops are housed are wasted. Mr. Williams is very odd indeed -squinchy-faced and querulous as a big hairy troll-but its fascinating to watch him play a villainous psycho developing a straight dramatic role without a trace of shtick. Hes been a buffoon so long I had forgotten he could act. Insomnia is not my kind of arsenic but its so well-made and enigmatic I liked it anyway. I guess you could call this a mixed (and mixed-up) review-like the movie itself.

"Insomnia A Rousing Thriller washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Insomnia A Rousing Thriller Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 24 2002 Sleeplessness and fatigue have reduced Los Angeles detective Will Dormer (Al Pacino) to a disheveled hollow-eyed zombie. And it doesnt help that hes on a murder case in Nightmute Alaska where (at this time of year) the sun never sets. But in Christopher Nolans outstanding ""Insomnia"" Dormers restlessness is a symptom of more troubling matters. Hes taken the Alaska case A? the murder of a 17-year-old girl A? to get away from an Internal Affairs investigation. Seems the pencil necks are onto him for a few transgressions details of which we dont learn immediately. Dormers partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) who has joined him in Nightmute admits he plans to cooperate with the investigators back home. Dormer believes Haps confession will be a strategic victory for Internal Affairs increasing the pressure on Dormer. Theres a thick fog as Dormer Hap and the Nightmute cops raid a log cabin A? the lair of the 17-year-olds suspected killer. Visibility is practically zero. When the suspect Walter Finch (Robin Williams) makes a break the cops chase him into the misty wilds. Shots ring out. Hap lies dying. Who shot the detective? Dormer and Finch a pulp novelist who knows his way around murder plots realize theyre both potential suspects. And over the course of this movie theyre forced to enter a relationship of uneasy compromise. Dormer grief-stricken over Haps death continues to pursue Finch as a suspect in the girls death even as Finch threatens blackmail retaliation. After all Finch and Dormer were the only witnesses. Meanwhile Dormers forced to partner with Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) a sycophantic detective who has studied and revered Dormers entire career. In this remake of the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name director Nolan (who made the brilliant ""Memento"") has given us something to treasure a thriller whose style structure and rhythms are so integrated with the story you cannot separate them. But theres more to the movie than integration of form and content. Thanks to the breathtaking work of screenwriter Hillary Seitz production designer Nathan Crowley cinematographer Wally Pfister (who shot ""Memento"") and Dody Dorn who edited it ""Insomnia"" is a contrapuntal symphony. Its thematically gloomy yet almost blindingly bright. Its claustrophobic yet stylistically liberating. And while its morally damning in some places its also deeply compassionate in others. Dont think this movies devoid of action. The story is nothing but especially when Dormer chases Finch across a river of floating rolling logs. Finch is sure-footed as he traverses the tricky obstacle course. But Dormers tired more ragged. What happens to him in those tense few moments is one of the most exhilarating scenes of the year. Pacino seems to have stayed up nights A? maybe even years A? for this role. Never did fatigue as a moral symbol get this range of inflection from an actor. Watching him perform here is like watching the affecting striations of a sunset A? a sunset that never quite gives into darkness. Dormer may be fading into oblivion and things may seem increasingly hopeless but he commands your attention for every moment of this endless day. INSOMNIA (R 118 minutes) A?

"Numb Alaska washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Numb Alaska Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 24 2002 Shorn of his manic comic genius Robin Williams is about the most uninteresting man to get a big movie since someone tried to make a star out of Brian Bosworth. If hes not purging his id of its demons dancers and dwarfs at the speed of a jet who cares? Well one answer is Christopher Nolan the smart 31-year-old director of ""Memento"" (backward running written was it by Yoda?) who is the force behind ""Insomnia."" So thats indeed Williams up there with his drab man-in-the-moon face registering almost zero emotion in a surprisingly dreary turn as Walter Finch a mystery writer turned psycho killer. Psycho killer Anthonys Hopkins and Perkins ate free lunches for years on that one; Williams will be lucky to get a Happy Meal at Mickey Ds just once. On the other hand Getting into this movie may cost you 8.50 the popcorn may run another 37.50 -- but watching Robin Williams have a gunfight with Al Pacino? Priceless. We only arrive at Williamss spectacular mediocrity after too long a time. The movie begins with the arrival of Pacino -- growly grouchy eating the camera almost to the f-stop regulator his eyes purple with angst -- as star L.A. homicide cop Will Dormer. Wills just flown to the far-off Alaskan town of Nightmute which appears to be reachable only by seaplane over an ice field. Why has this flashy character been sent to the land of the midnight sun on a largely unexceptional case far from the neon jungles in which he flourished? Possibly because he initiated a slaughterific downtown gunfight in ""Heat""? No he was a different character then. Same squad different cop. This time it seems L.A. robbery-homicide has come under fire for certain ah ethical shortcuts and the unit boss wants his No. 1 guy out of the limelight for a time. But this trip is awkwardly planned. Along with Will is his partner Hap Eckhart (the always pleasant Martin Donovan). Hap stung by the internal affairs division plans to give testimony he cheerfully informs Will that may implicate Will thereby destroying his career and turning all his cases over setting free the goblins and ghoulies Will has spent his life convicting occasionally honestly. Is this an accident waiting to happen or what? And when it happens its the precipitating event in the film. On stakeout in the fog for the killer of a teenage girl Will shoots Hap by mistake. It seems to be an accident but Will knows how incriminating the circumstances are so he adroitly manipulates the evidence to suggest that the escaping killer (who did shoot at them) fired the killing shots. Will is savvy enough to get away with it except for one thing The killer saw him shoot his partner and quickly sees it as a way to leverage Will out of pressing the investigation forward. What neither has counted on is the presence of local homicide detective Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank this time a woman) who begins to pick at tiny inconsistencies in Wills improvised story. Enter Mork. Oh I wish. You see Robin Williams and psycho killer and you think hmmmmm. You see the movie and you think zzzzzzzzz. Hes just okay and the movie turns out to be a series of highly technical manipulations mostly of ballistic evidence that involves trying to keep track of which of three particular guns (two owned by Dormer one by Finch) fired which bullets. At one point after shooting a dead doggie (unpleasant) Will substitutes a bullet from one gun for another in the lab so that it computes out to his innocence but again Finch knows. It helps if you know the difference between a 9mm a .45 and a .38. It also helps if you dont get upset that they call a .380 a 9mm so that the audience wont confuse it with the .38. But I realize Most of you are going to be lost. Thats just the way it is folks. You would think that a Williams-Pacino confab when it finally rolls around might light some sparks. But it doesnt Pacino overacts gloweringly and Williams evidently intimidated just goes away. Not even Academy Award winner Swank puts up much of a fight. Only Nicky Katt as a smart young local detective registers strongly enough to stay with Pacino. An exacerbating factor is the disorder of the title. Up in Nightmute its all daylight all the time 24-7. So Pacinos Dormer cant get a decent nights sleep because theres no night. The longer he stays awake the more powerfully he overacts. Finally hes up to Oscar level a mad King Lear of exhaustion blasting lines out to the cheap seats afraid someone will miss his tank-like nuances. This is pure film-noir convention Characters always have breakdowns of some sort or other the DTs withdrawal the blue munchies or something. But Nolan clearly didnt have the nerve to rein in Pacino. In fact thats another disappointment in the film. Both in his first film the little-seen ""Following"" and in his breakout hit ""Memento"" Nolan showed an edgy creativity and willingness to bend the rules. But in this film he seems overwhelmed by the budget the egos of the stars the thinness of the script and he doesnt impose much personality on the picture. Its all Pacino. The second exacerbating factor is that the movie has been done better before. A few years back AFI brought in the far-superior Norwegian version with another great actor in the detectives role Stellan Skarsgard. The whole film was much more muted and Scandinavian; somehow all the angst was less pyrotechnic yet deeper. It also had a more European and more appropriate ending. I think the advertising slogan said it best Den som synder sover ikke. INSOMNIA (R 118 minutes) - Contains graphic representations of murder forensics and victims and violence. At area theaters.

"USATODAY.com - Insomnia awakens psychological-thriller genre Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 05/24/2002 - Updated 0909 AM ET Insomnia awakens psychological-thriller genre By Mike Clark USA TODAY Al Pacino and Robin Williams confront each other in Insomnia. Insomnia gets more out of novel locales than any movie in a while and theres equally fresh casting in this Alaska murder mystery where the sun never sets. A perfect fit between filmmaker (Mementos Christopher Nolan) and material (Norways same-name psycho-chiller from 1997) this remake gets all there is to get out of a peculiar premise with promise Al Pacino loathing Robin Williams. Read more below Stories Read the four star review Director doesnt want fans getting too comfortable Video Trailer for Insomnia Insomnia (out of four) Stars Al Pacino Robin Williams Hilary Swank Martin Donovan Director Christopher Nolan Distributor Warner Bros. Rating R for language some violence and brief nudity Opens Friday nationwide We begin with Pacino as fans prefer to see him becoming unhinged. Cast as an L.A. supercop now under an Internal Affairs cloud (say it aint so Serpico) Pacino and his partner (Martin Donovan) escape the heat by flying to a northwest nowhere to help an old pal on a case. An itching-to-get-out teen has been brutally murdered and suspects include her mysterious older lover. Heard over the phone but not seen in close-up until an hour in the victims senior squeeze (Robin Williams in a triumph of against-type casting) turns out to be at minimum a manipulating creep. Almost immediately into Pacinos investigation Williams witnesses the detective screw up so badly in a stake-out (no fair telling more) that hes primed to play some mind games. Fully aware that Pacino thinks him guilty Williams tries to convince the cop that they are morally flawed brethren. Pacino pooh-poohs with profanities and stacks up evidence against this pest. Boys Dont Cry Oscar winner Hilary Swank plays the storys other principal a subordinate but important role that makes up for her An Affair of the Necklace debacle. A green but studious local cop who has devoured Pacinos criminology writings her character has an increasingly tough time reconciling ardor for a professional master with inconsistencies in his investigation. And it doesnt help that Pacino is becoming more and more disheveled as the midnight sun beams into his hotel room killing his sleep night after night. The physically beautiful but emotionally barren setting (called the ""halibut fishing capital of the world"") is a town where people only come says one local to escape something. Nolan tellingly contrasts the outdoor splendor with modest restaurants and successful novelist Williams home which looks like a used-book store with a rumpled bed. We know were in a fresh screen milieu fully sustained by the director when Pacino wants to high-tail it to the high school at 10 oclock to grill a suspect. Then someone points out that its uh 10 at night which solidifies Insomnia as the exact opposite of film noir.

Directed by Christopher Nolan from a screenplay by Hillary Seitz. 118 minutes. Rated R for language some violence and brief nudity. Several theaters. In the opening scenes of Christopher Nolans smart moody thriller a plane flies low over a glacier soaring over the strange pitted mass of dingy blue-tinged white. We seem to be entering a mysterious wonderland like the planet Naboo or Tolkiens Middle-earth -- but no its just the town of Nightmute Alaska home of the midnight sun. Disorientation lies beneath ""Insomnia"" and Nolan establishes this from the start. Veteran detective Will Dormer (a nice pun on the French verb for ""sleep"") played to weary perfection by Al Pacino arrives in Nightmute to lead a murder investigation. Taking charge of the local team he barks an order to visit the victims high school. The other detectives eye each other before one offers that its 10 oclock at night. The sun -- an oddly grayish wet light -- is still high in the sky. Like Erik Skjoldbjaergs haunting 1997 Norwegian film ""Insomnia"" on which this film is based (available on DVD and not to be missed) this ""Insomnia"" seems at first to be a fairly standard police procedural but quickly veers into psychological territory with Dormer as a not-quite-heroic hero. The case frustrates him as does the never-ending light that torments his sleep. And in a moment of disorientation when the suspect is near a gun is fired and something terrible happens sending Dormer into a downward spiral. Nolan demonstrated with ""Memento"" (and the lesser-seen but equally adept ""Following"") that hes an expert with the slipperiness of time. While ""Insomnias"" structure seems conventional compared to the backward puzzle-box of ""Memento"" its hardly straightforward. Time has collapsed for sleep-deprived Dormer and so we see tiny glimpses of flashbacks -- most notably the image of blood glopping onto the weave of a white shirt. Soon even the sounds of the office are turning inward on him. Despite a nifty action sequence involving floating logs and the obligatory final-act violence ""Insomnia"" is really an actors showcase. Pacino his creased face looking like its been aged in a smokehouse is wonderfully bleary as the increasingly confused Dormer. ""Its so bright in here"" he pathetically tells the no-nonsense hotel clerk (Maura Tierney) late in the film though the room is dark. Hes on the edge of madness and Pacino isnt afraid to totter. Robin Williams as murder suspect Walter Finch is equally remarkable in a different way. He seems to have completely emptied his usual bag of tricks employing a measured blandness that is actually rather frightening -- theres not a trace of a twinkle or of the odd pseudo-accent that Williams often employs. Its an absolutely minimalist performance and a triumph of less-is-more. And Hilary Swank playing an idealistic young Nightmute detective with a bright smile and a sensible bob makes something lovely from what could have been a throwaway role. Ellie Burr who idolizes Dormer has the upright posture and scrubbed-clean demeanor of someone who was always first in her class; and her ultimate realization of her idols shortcomings is surprisingly touching. In the end only one is left standing as Nolan shows us a pale corpse slowly disappearing below the icy-gray water -- a beautiful haunting moment from a director whos rapidly proving himself to be a master of his craft.

Starring Al Pacino Robin Williams and Hilary Swank. Directed by Christopher Nolan. (VHS and DVD. R. 120 minutes.) This movies title -- ""Insomnia"" -- and the fact that it stars Al Pacino could easily lead people to expect at least one scene in which the actor screams ""I cant sleep"" and sprays saliva in all directions. Those of us who love the manic flailing side of Pacino who enjoy him yelling anything (except ""hoo-hah"") might therefore be disappointed by the actors weary demeanor throughout his new movie at least at first. Not only does he do no screaming but also he doesnt have a single moment of suppressed pent-up teeth-grinding rage. (""They pull me back in."") But stick with ""Insomnia."" Christopher Nolans intelligent and penetrating direction brings out a new side of Pacino. Along the way Nolan also gives us a new Robin Williams and a transformed Hilary Swank. Directing his first big- budget Hollywood movie Nolan (""Memento"") controls every nuance of the emotional temperature. The result is something more than an effective thriller. ""Insomnia"" is a haunting psychological drama. .5 Pacino is tired even as the movie starts. He plays a Los Angeles homicide detective named Dormer who is sent with his partner (Martin Donovan) to a remote Alaskan village to look into the bludgeoning death of a high school girl. Pacino gives the character a bone-tired life weariness. The heavy things hes seen have put bags under his eyes. Hes so exhausted he can barely manage a smile for the chipper local cop (Swank) assigned to be his assistant. Pacino is not usually a ""less is more"" type of actor but we see the strategy begin to pay off early in ""Insomnia."" After a shootout in thick fog he approaches what he thinks will be the corpse of a murder suspect. Instead he finds that he has just shot his partner. From there ""Insomnia"" becomes the story of two cases -- the murder under investigation and the killing that the detective hopes will remain unsolved. Swank emerges as a fresh and engaging actress. There are moments in ""Insomnia"" when the sameness of the emotional landscape becomes as wearying as the constant sunshine but that isnt a damning flaw and in any case it was probably Nolans intention. Here as in ""Memento"" the director shows how ""film bright"" can be as dramatic oppressive and revealing as film noir. Advisory This film contains strong language and violence.

Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Has Christopher Nolan told you about his condition? Hes unable to make movies unless theyre about men suffering from strange neurological afflictions men so plagued by guilt over what they may or may not have done that the entire world becomes a distorted reflection of their psychological distress men searching for killers when what they really need to do is take a long hard look in the mirror. Of course Nolan is not the first young director of thrillers to exhibit obsessive-compulsive tendencies. The good news is that based on the evidence of ""Insomnia"" his big-budget follow-up to the cult smash ""Memento"" Nolan seems to be the genuine article weirdo-genius-wise. Unlike the vast majority of aspiring Hitchcocks before him -- clever kids with no real interest in human behavior whose movies are a collection of in-jokes and stylistic tics -- Nolan believes in the paranoid universes he creates. Comparing a 31-year-old director with three films on his resume (and thats including Nolans first feature the zero-budget indie ""Following"") to the Master of Suspense is patently unfair but its also inevitable. And for once I dont mean it as a putdown. I can think of no other contemporary director who is actually making the kinds of films Hitchcock would be making now as opposed to slavishly imitating this or that camera angle from ""Strangers on a Train"" in the hope of lending significance to some piece of perfunctory and insincere crap. ""Insomnia"" may disappoint hardcore ""Memento"" devotees. The story about a wayward L.A. cop who loses his grip on reality while investigating a murder in Alaska isnt told backward or sideways or upside down. No one will need a detailed online exegesis to figure out what happens. Its merely a gripping mainstream thriller with a first-rate cast a peculiar setting that is as much psychological as geographical and a clammy claustrophobic atmosphere. As in all good thrillers -- as in ""Memento"" for example beneath the reverse narrative and the geek-boy puzzler -- the questions in ""Insomnia"" are simple and speak to our profoundest level of moral uneasiness. How can we tell good people from bad? Do we ever really know what we want? Are men always weaselly scum and women always treacherous bitches? (Answers We cant no and yes.) This film is adapted (by screenwriter Hillary Seitz) from the 1997 Norwegian film of the same name directed by Erik Skjoldbaerg in which Stellan Skarsgard plays the Oslo homicide investigator sent to the far north where he finds the constant daylight of the Arctic summer a little hard to take. Skjoldbaergs ""Insomnia"" makes a virtue out of its anti-Hollywood intimacy and the barrenness of its rural setting and at times you can feel Nolan struggling for something of the same effect on perhaps 20 times the budget. Again fans of the original may decide to feel superior to this multiplex remake but I think Nolans success here is grounds for celebration. In a year that so far has offered little more than dippy die-stamped Hollywood product heres proof that its still possible to make pop-oriented yet personal movies with an A-list cast and a zillion bucks. With three Oscar-winners in the cast (count em) many directors would get out of the way of all those oversize egos and let them wander the scripts verdant fields chewing on whatever they will. Nolan pretty well keeps his stars focused and under control which in the case of Robin Williams is something of a miracle (well get to that later). But ""Insomnia"" belongs unambiguously to Al Pacino who looks even more like a thrice-boiled tea bag here than he did in ""The Insider."" If Pacino can and often does turn a sigh or a sip of coffee into an operatic gesture worthy of a Shakespeare-festival Shylock this remains by his standards a restrained performance. Pacino plays Will Dormer a legendary Los Angeles detective who has been lent out to the northern Alaska town of Nightmute where the grisly murder of a local young woman has authorities puzzled. (If you ask me the combination of the towns name and Dormers -- approximately the verb ""to sleep"" in any Romance language -- is pushing the outer boundaries of screenplay cleverness.) No it isnt all that likely a setup but never mind. A former L.A. colleague of Wills who now works in Nightmute assures him that police work isnt that different in the great white north ""There are good guys. There are bad guys. Theres just a lot less public relations."" You Might Also Like Nolan supplies the requisite helicopter shots of the stunning wilderness surrounding Nightmute (for once the Hollywood propensity to shoot every movie in Canada is justified) but nobodys going to confuse him with David Lean; hes not interested in scenery for its pictorial merits. Those images in fact reminded me of the shots of endless Rocky Mountain forest at the beginning of Stanley Kubricks ""The Shining"" a not-too-distant cousin to this film. In both cases the director sees the wilderness almost entirely in metaphorical terms as a visual corollary to the uprooted isolated psychology of his main character. Will is embraced almost literally by Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) a puppyish Nightmute cop who has studied his most famous homicide investigations and looks to him as an acolyte looks to a doughnut-fueled guru. Ellies not in drag or anything but this is a pretty boy-like role; perhaps after her disastrous performance in ""The Affair of the Necklace"" Swank is more at peace with the androgyny that seems central to her screen persona. Its interesting in fact that theres no sexual or romantic undertone to Ellies relationship with Will (or for that matter anywhere else in this supremely chaste film). Speaking of the Nightmute killer Will tells the worshipful Ellie ""This guy crossed the line and didnt even blink. You dont come back from that."" Briefly in a few early scenes that seem to reveal very little Nolan and Seitz put everything in ""Insomnia"" on the table. Will and his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) have been exiled to Alaska while a police corruption scandal in which both may be implicated unfolds in California. Ellie will have to decide whether Will is really the man she thinks he is or is in fact a guy who crossed the line and cant come back. Bedeviled by the sun that never sets and by whatevers buzzing in his head Will cant sleep. When Will and Hap pursue the murder suspect onto a rocky fog-shrouded beach -- once again a creepy landscape that seems more allegorical than real -- shots are fired and Hap goes down convinced that Will has shot him deliberately to shut him up. (Hold those cards and letters people Nothing that happens in the first 20 minutes and is obvious in the trailer can be considered a spoiler.) Has he? Even Will doesnt know for sure but just in case he lies to Haps wife lies to Ellie meddles with the evidence and generally engages in a Nixonian coverup that can only make things worse. Then Will starts to get sympathetic late-night phone calls from the principal murder suspect a mild-mannered local mystery writer named Walter Finch (Williams). ""Are you seeing things?"" Walter asks. ""Little trails? Flashes of light?"" Walter insists that he and Will arent so different. He hadnt meant to kill that girl either honest. It was like Haps death; it just sort of happened. Considering how similar their situations are maybe they can work something out. Will blunders through the endless Alaskan daylight like an aging circus bear and Ellie quotes his own ghostwritten wisdom back at him ""A good cop cant sleep because part of the puzzle is missing. A bad cop cant sleep because his conscience wont let him."" Anything you might want to say about Williams delicate performance here is true Playing a psychopath is clearly a smart career move -- in fact it smacks of career advice from an agent or publicist -- and he has always excelled at characters whose surface is subtly at odds with whats inside them. But the thing about ""Insomnia"" is that Walter really doesnt matter. When Will tells him in that trademark Pacino combination of singsong and growl ""Youre about as mysterious to me as a blocked toilet is to a fuckin plumber"" hes not kidding. Walter is a device that forces Will to come to grips with his own guilt and try to expiate it -- in one unforgettable scene he virtually drowns in it -- to commit his worst crimes and try to forgive himself. And of course to travel into the deepest busted-wiper-blade visions of insomniac delusion that Nolan can conjure up. Strictly in terms of plot ""Insomnia"" isnt much of a mystery. But like the best thrillers it dives below the ordered surface of the genre into the coldest waters of the individual soul where Hitchcock and David Lynch and Dostoyevsky have ventured. Does Christopher Nolan belong in that company? Not quite yet but hes on the way. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

In Christopher Nolans follow-up to Memento creepy morally dark things routinely happen in broad daylight.When youre as far north as Nightmute - a playful name given the white nights of summer - in June the sun never ever sets.Pacino plays Will Dormer - the surname means ""to sleep"" in French - an LAPD hotshot sleepless in Nightmute where hes sent with his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) to find the murderer of a local high schooler. Their arrival cop celebrities in this glacier-pocked outpost awes local cop Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank).When Dormer first appears the bags under his eyes are already sizable but still would qualify as carry-on. After a week of sleeplessness though any airline would demand that he check them as baggage.Because Dormer possesses arrogance diligence and tunnel vision he would seem the right man for the job. But the blinding relentless sun and the blindsiding relentless chutzpah of the perpetrator make Dormer squint when most he needs to keep his eyes wide open.Early on Dormer sniffs out the criminal (Robin Williams more unnervingly effective as a voice on the telephone than he is on screen) who in turn knows something about the detective that will destroy not just Dormers credibility but also his career.When Williams appears his nose made eerily knifelike by the distorting lenses and extreme close-ups favored by Nolan the film becomes one of those cat-and-mouse stories in which feline and rodent instantly recognize each other as predatory twins.The salient difference between the Norwegian original an unpretentious police procedural starring Stellan Skarsgard and this remake scripted by Hillary Seitz is that Nolan is overawed by the landscape of his actors faces and they sometimes overwhelm the movie.Pacino that most transparent of actors fares better than the opaque Williams who is not as well equipped as his costar to convey the multitudes roiling inside him. Of the many excellent supporting players Donovan makes a strong impression as a creature out of his natural habitat; likewise Maura Tierney as the concierge chef and bottle washer at the local lodge.With Insomnia his third feature Nolan 32 has proven himself a precocious master of the thriller unsettling the audience with a brief image of blood seeping through fabric.His first two films Following (1999) and Memento (2001) derived their edge from their jagged jigsaw structure. Insomnia is a chronological more behavioral study deriving its edge from Pacinos serrated performance.Contact Carrie Rickey at crickeyphillynews.com or 215-854-5402.Insomnia  (Out of four stars)Produced by Paul Junger Witt Edward L.

Running time 120 minutes. Rated R (violence profanity sexual references). At the E-Walk the Cinema 1 the Battery Park City others. INSOMNIA"" is a four-course gourmet alternative to summer popcorn flicks serving up the meatiest performances Al Pacino and Robin Williams have given in many years - while confirming that director Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") is one of the most gifted cinematic chefs around. A rare case of an American remake that actually improves on a European movie this intense character-driven thriller is based on an atmospheric but somewhat less fleshed-out Norwegian film of the same title that starred Stellan Skarsgard. The action has been moved to another land of midnight sun Alaska where flamboyant LAPD detective Will Dormer (Pacino) and his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) have been dispatched to assist in finding the killer of a 17-year-old girl. Actually their nervous superiors in Los Angeles want to get the detectives out of the reach of Internal Affairs which is on the verge of pressuring Hap to finger Will for fabricating evidence in an old child-murder case back home. Theres so much tension between the two detectives that when Will accidentally shoots Hap to death - during a fog-shrouded chase after the Alaska killer - Will panics and tries to frame the murderer for Haps death. Wills mounting guilt and anxiety are symbolized quite effectively by his futile struggle to get some sleep in a small town where the sun never sets. And our hero is kept tossing and turning when the killer - a third-rate mystery writer named Walter Finch (Williams) - informs Will that he saw the detective shoot Hap. Even worse hes figured out why Will is lying about it. Poor Will is torn between confessing his deception - and seeing his reputation and lifes work hit an iceberg - and collaborating with a psychopath on a devious scheme to frame a ready-made suspect the first victims sleazy abusive boyfriend (Jonathan Jackson). Serving as Wills surrogate conscience is Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank) an eager-beaver young local cop whose worship of Will is challenged as she investigates the cops shooting. Director Nolan makes an assured transition from the brilliantly idiosyncratic indie ""Memento"" to this unabashed big-budget big-star vehicle. He imaginatively uses the breathtaking locations - it was actually shot mostly in British Columbia - to create a sense of place that sweeps you into the story. A bravura chase sequence on a logjam - one character ends up trapped beneath the freezing water - is not for the faint of heart. Working from an intelligent script by Hillary Seitz that expands on the characters motivations Nolan gets a wonderfully modulated performance by Pacino whose unraveling bravado is never allowed to explode into the kind of over-the-top acting that has characterized much of the actors work since ""Scent of a Woman."" Williams who doesnt appear on camera until halfway into the movie very effectively underplays the regular-guy killer who unnerves Will by comparing his ""accident"" with Hap to Walters killing of the teenager he was ""mentoring."" The solid supporting cast includes Maura Tierney as an innkeeper with a few secrets of her own and Katherine Isabelle as the victims Lolita-esque best friend both of whom have memorable encounters with Will. ""Insomnia"" and Pacino are the years first bona-fide Oscar contenders. Dont miss it.

"Caught Up in Insomnias Deft Waking Nightmare - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Caught Up in Insomnias Deft Waking NightmareMay 24 2002|KENNETH TURAN | TIMES STAFF WRITER ""When does it get dark around here"" Will Dormer asks the local cops in Nightmute Alaska the halibut fishing capital of the world and they only smile. During the summer months this far north of the Arctic Circle the only darkness as the Shadow liked to say lurks in the hearts of men and there is plenty to go around.A Los Angeles Police Department detective on loan to the Nightmute force to investigate a particularly disturbing homicide Dormer (masterfully played by Al Pacino) will be disoriented by more than the midnight sun in ""Insomnia."" This taut and intelligent psychological thriller a kind of white nights film noir investigates moral ambiguity as well as bad behavior illuminating the risks even decent people run of losing their way in the dense thickets of crime.As both his earlier films the less-seen ""Following"" and the indie powerhouse ""Memento"" demonstrated director Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker at home with dislocation and dissociation. ""Insomnia"" shows an equally welcome ability a gift of creating intelligent engrossing popular entertainment.This is a skill Nolan shares with one of ""Insomnias"" executive producers Steven Soderbergh who recognized a kindred spirit in Nolan and supported him on the project. Having a director this thoughtful doing genre material results in considerably more texture than usual in a film that understands how immorality can ooze into goodness like a drop of blood seeping into a white shirt.Although smartly written by Hillary Seitz in a promising debut ""Insomnias"" origins go further back to an excellent 1997 Norwegian thriller of the same name directed and co-written by Erik Skjoldbjaerg and starring Stellan Skarsgard in the Pacino role. Seitzs script sticks closely to the original but Nolan has had no trouble using a variety of skills to make the material his own.Working with his ""Memento"" collaborators cinematographer Wally Pfister and editor Dody Dorn and shooting largely in British Columbia Nolan once again displays an unmistakable visual confidence and a feeling for bravura moments like a nerve-wracking chase across a slippery logjam floating down a frigid river.As he showed with Guy Pearce in ""Memento"" Nolan is also adept at working with actors and the beneficiaries this time are not only Pacino but also co-stars Robin Williams and Hilary Swank all of whom profit from the directors ability to elicit reined-in performances. No one benefits from this tight control more than the veteran Pacino who owns the film from the first moment we see Det. Dormer flying into Nightmute with his LAPD partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) and looking as drained and bloodless as the crime scene photos of murdered 17-year-old Kay Connell he holds on his lap.An actor whos been around and looks it (and who was playing cops as far back as 1973s ""Serpico"") Pacino was a natural choice for one of those bleak veteran detectives whos next door to a legend in law-enforcement circles. Dormer may look tired he may actually be tired but he remains a watchful hawk patiently waiting for the opportunity to strike.Dormer and his partner are not really in Nightmute as a friendly gesture from a large city chief to a small one. Theyre in town in part for a respite from an Internal Affairs probe of their conduct back home. Dormer especially is worried and agitated that his reputation his very lifes work will be destroyed by those he thinks ""suck the marrow out of real cops.""If Dormer and company represent experience Swanks Det. Ellie Burr is all innocence and enthusiasm as the youngest member of the Nightmute force someone who actually studied Dormers cases in the academy. While Swanks performance inevitably opens on a gee-whiz note it toughens and gets more heft as the case takes increasingly serious turns.It doesnt take Dormer long to establish that Kay was murdered by someone who knew her well someone who took enormous trouble and care to groom the corpse hed savagely beaten to death. ""This guy he crossed a line"" Dormer says ""and he didnt even blink.""But despite this insight Dormer finds the case uncommonly difficult. An unexpected crisis causes his situation to unravel and the 24-hour sun which makes sleep impossible starts to prey on his mind. More and more Dormer feels trapped by the unceasing light unable to escape from its punishing insidious brightness.Adding to his difficulties are a series of taunting late-night phone calls from a voice we immediately recognize as Robin Williams. The detective immediately focuses on his character Walter Finch as the main suspect. Finch it turns out is an especially clever man eager to engage Dormer in elaborate mind games trying to make him somehow complicit in a growing moral darkness that threatens to envelop the entire case.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESBoring In On AlJanuary 12 1986Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2002/may/24/entertainment/et-turan24,200,insomnia23,insomnia,latimes

He lies awake in bed the sun invading his room his eyelids. Dormer (Al Pacino) is a Los Angeles homicide detective working on a case in Alaska. Its summer and the sun never sets. Dormer tosses and turns all night but the thoughts that fill his head have little to do with his case. He has a guilty conscience. Hes lost his way and he despairs of ever finding it. Whats worse the suspect hes chasing -- a crime novelist played by Robin Williams -- knows things about him that Dormer would rather keep hidden. The suspect proposes a deal. ""Were in the same situation here"" he whispers. ""We need each other."" The superb Insomnia is a crime drama that achieves with apparent ease what so many other movies of its type try but fail to do Its gripping entertainment in a popular vein -- the police procedural -- that nevertheless follows no preconceived formulas. It delights in subverting expectations. The big chase involves no cars or collisions but guys scampering across logs floating on a river. The lead detective spends the night in a motel room with a pretty woman but there isnt a whiff of sex (a far cry from the Norwegian film on which this is based). And the killers identity isnt half as mysterious as his motivations nor as intriguing as his ability to rationalize and excuse his actions. But the main thing that distinguishes this from lesser crime movies -- which is to say most of them -- is its moral complexity and its insistence that for Dormer there are other things at stake as important as the killers capture. After almost a week of sleepless nights Dormer wanders about in a mental and moral haze. The movie objectifies his condition in a scene near the beginning. During a chase through a foggy river bottom amid spectral lifeless trees Dormer could be in a horror movie or the haunted interior of a troubled mind. There are two deaths. One occurs before our eyes. Both are investigated. Dormers pursuit of Walter Finch (Williams) appears to inhabit center stage but the movies primary inquiry -- one not conducted by police characters but by the films focus -- is into the nature of iniquity the way it can grow unnoticed from a single act and corrupt the soul. Dormer and his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) go to the tiny town of Nightmute Alaska because a high school student has been killed and the local cops cant solve the case. The murderer was smart enough to wash away the evidence. Examining the body Dormer predicts the killer will strike again. ""He crossed the line and he didnt even blink"" the detective says with certainty. ""You dont come back from that."" Dormers reputation precedes him. A young detective Ellie Burr (well-played by Hilary Swank) has followed his cases and hangs on his every word. She welcomes the chance to learn from him. He is a superlative cop. He also is a worried cop. Back in Los Angeles an investigation into police corruption has been launched. His high profile will likely make him a target. He once planted evidence to secure a conviction against a man he knew was guilty. A simple act arguably done for a good purpose. But through decisions such as this the film suggests we are forever tainted our destinies sealed. As Dormer says ""You dont come back."" Insomnia is director Christopher Nolans first film since receiving acclaim for his brilliant time-shifting Memento in 2000. The new film which Nolan didnt write is more restrained more conventionally structured but it shows that Nolan doesnt need gimmicks to dazzle an audience. He does it here through attention to detail the steady accumulation of tension and dread and by coaxing terrific performances from his actors particularly Pacino whose work is as sterling as any he has done. Williams too is good. This is one of three bad guys he plays this year (the others are in Death to Smoochy and the upcoming One Hour Photo). Hes so effective that he should consider abandoning the schmaltzy pictures he usually does. One of the details that works is Dormers name. It cant be a coincidence that it sounds so similar to the Latinate word for ""sleep."" As he lies awake each night his name mocks him Will Dormer. When? When will Dormer sleep?

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday May 24 2002 1200AM EDT Last updated Saturday Mar. 21 2009 1225AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Insomnia Directed by Christopher Nolan Written by Hillary Seitz Starring Al Pacino Robin Williams Hilary Swank Classification AA Rating  In the ongoing case of the fan versus the movies the evidence suggests that a good policier is damn hard to find. So when you come across one that can boast a decent script taut direction and a single superb performance theres no need for prolonged deliberation. The critical verdict is open and shut Insomnia is definitely worth staying up for. Apparently the screenplay borrows from a Norwegian film of five years ago. Cant say Ive seen it but this adaptation -- transplanted to a remote town in Alaska in the season of the midnight sun -- works just fine. But what works even better is the sheer engrossing presence of Al Pacino. Hes virtually never off camera which keeps alternating between closeups of his face and sweeping panoramas of the Alaskan surroundings until the two sights begin to seem of a piece. With age the Pacino mug has become a topographical wonder -- the crags the fissures the craters harbouring those limpid pools -- and the owner is sure not afraid to show it off. So armed Pacino plays a cop again. From Serpico to Heat and stops between hes walked the police beat many times before and were quick to plug into his easy rhythms. This time his man Will operates out of Los Angeles but Pacino chooses to give him a slight drawl just a faint hint of Southern gothic. Seems Will a proud career detective with a taste for evidence-planting is in a spot of trouble with Internal Affairs and his younger partner Hap (Martin Donovan) is inclined to testify against him to save his own skin. Anyway theres obvious tension between the pair as they fly up north called in by the local law to aid in a murder investigation -- a pretty teenager got beaten to death. Getting straight down to the job our wily veteran is quick to zero in on a suspect which gives rise to another relative rarity Wow a nifty chase scene unfolding amid giant boulders wrapped in dense fog. There in the disorienting murk the elder cop draws a bead on a distant figure and fatally shoots his problematic partner. Approaching the prone body Will looks down in horror. Watch the look closely because in the silent mastery of that lone glance Pacino sums up the entire moral dilemma Did this ""accident"" happen by mistake or by design? Of course that same question might be put to the killer being chased. A card-carrying sociopath he too denies any intention to murder but instead pins the blame on the usual genetic suspects -- some combination of faulty cranial wiring and an uncontrollable subconscious. By his reasoning raining deadly blows on an innocent girl is itself a tragic accident. What we have here then is not your standard mystery. The killers identity and culpability are both clearly established early on. Rather the suspense is ethical and lies in bringing together the pursuer and the pursued thereby allowing nominal virtue and ostensible vice to explore their common bonds and compare their degrees of guilt. These meetings occur in the third act and after such an impressive buildup prove a bit disappointing never getting much beyond the cliche of the ""thin blue line"" that separates law-enforcer from law-breaker. Part of the problem is a plot that in order to arrange the confabs gets a little too contrived. The other part is the casting of Robin Williams as the killer. The idea is fine -- like many comics Williams is also funny-odd and the picture hopes that he can convert his inherent oddness into overt creepiness. But Williams seems to head in the opposite direction and (just when he needs them most) smoothes over his eccentricities allowing the performance to err on the side of bland. As for the other principal Hilary Swank pops up as an eager rookie cop but she disappears in the margins of the role -- theres nothing in this film to test her talent. Thats not true of director Christopher Nolan who rises nicely to the challenge. His work in Memento with its backward narrative was quite the tour de force -- the guy is a technical wizard. Here though Nolan takes pains to steer away from visual gimmickry and manages the trickier feat of looking consistently stylish yet never showy. And when in doubt he can always point the lens at his greatest asset. Yes Pacino whose work only gets stronger as the tale progresses. His character suffers from insomnia kept perpetually awake by the unsetting sun that doubles as his unblinking conscience. With every passing frame that face of his must reflect the toll taken by the sleepless hours. And it does -- the crags seem to widen the fissures deepen and this shifting landscape becomes his emotional canvas. His acting can sometimes be mannered but not here. When all else is said and done Insomnia runs on the pure adrenalin of Pacinos performance.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Insomnia Rob McEwan) A- Insomnia (Movie - 2002) Genre Drama Mystery and Thriller; Starring Al Pacino Hilary Swank Robin Williams Martin Donovan (Actor) Maura Tierney; Director Christopher Nolan; Author Hillary Seitz; Producer (person) Steven Soderbergh; Release Date Wide 05/24/2002; Runtime (in minutes) 118; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted May 31 2002 -- 1200 AM EDT In the superb psychological thriller Insomnia Al Pacinos face is battered by weariness accrued from the psychic compromises of every cop he has ever portrayed in a famous career of pretend law enforcement. He looks crumpled unretouched - and you cant take your eyes off him. Pacino plays Will Dormer a veteran detective whose natural job-induced exhaustion is heightened by exposure to the alien northern Alaskan landscape he finds himself in Dormer and his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are on loan from the LAPD to help solve the murder of a teenage girl and while theyre familiar with the gruesome fetishistic details of the case theyre not prepared for the severe sensory disorientation brought on by the never-setting sun. Physical sleep and spiritual rest become equally elusive as the shadows surrounding this Dormer are exposed to a relentless light. Playing a haggard man staggering deeper into moral and physical sleeplessness Pacino the great actor is wide awake giving a more powerful nuanced performance than he has in years. And as reclusive mystery writer Walter Finch a prime suspect psychologically astute enough to toy sadistically with Dormers wrecked head and body clock Robin Williams - one of our more brazen scenery chewers - also snaps to investing Finch with a soft-spoken finicky creepiness. The link between the two is the directorial confidence of Christopher Nolan. Neither repeating nor losing touch with the keen trickiness of ""Memento"" or his feature debut ""Following"" he uses his first big Hollywood picture - a good basic cop flick - to demonstrate that hes the real deal. This is a filmmaker in full control of mood tone and pacing to whom actors as wildly different as Pacino and Williams can entrust their best instincts rather than their showiest. As in ""Memento"" ""Insomnia"" (a remake scripted by first-timer Hillary Seitz of an already terrific 1997 Norwegian film starring Stellan Skarsgard) is about a man who comes to distrust his own perceptions and who must negotiate a jury-rigged system of clues and ethics to accomplish his goals. But this time Nolan links his stylish cinematic moves more effortlessly to his characters inner lives. (This time his characters actually have inner lives.) So for example when Dormer attempts more and more desperately to block out the light (of reckoning after a lifetime of compromises) leaking into his hotel room the shards and slashes of imagery Nolan assembles convey more than cool kinetic art direction - they also express believable psychic unraveling. A significant chunk of ""Insomnia"" is spent in literal fog or rain or mud or an approximation of the inside of one mans eyelids. The luxuriously mournful fog indeed proves crucial when shots ring out as the cops pursue Finch in a slippery stakeout and Eckhart falls. Thats when the aging cops guilt-ridden soul-draining insomnia really kicks in. Hilary Swank shoulders the add-a-girl role of the bright young local rookie whose dewy admiration of Dormer is tempered by what she uncovers in her own enterprising police investigation. While the story provides several nifty action sequences particularly a chase over wet floating logs some of the most riveting stuff involves nothing more high-concept or action-packed than two actors sharing a meal. One riveting scene hangs on the banality of the two LAPD cops sitting in their rustic Alaskan hotel restaurant where Eckhart informs Dormer that hes decided to cooperate with an Internal Affairs investigation back home implicating his colleague in grievous procedural misconduct that will undoubtedly end Dormers career in disgrace. Its not what the partners say to each other so much as the crackling connection between the two actors that enthralls This is what it looks like when talent is deep with none of the poses twitches and shouts that too often pass for serious performance in movies today. Something about the low-key naturalism of Donovan (an unruffled underused actor with a mortuary calm regularly on display in Hal Hartley films) ignites Pacino and relaxes him too. The star has rarely looked so well taken care of (and thus energized) by the project hes in. And for that I credit the luck of the remake (rent the striking original and judge for yourself) the talent of Nolan and one more thing too a complexity of character increasingly rare in movies. In ""Memento"" Guy Pearce plays a walking erasable chalkboard who cant remember from minute to minute whether hes chasing or being chased which is really interesting as a neurological oddity and the basis for a reshuffled narrative structure. But the freak is a cipher and empathy is expendable. Pacinos Will Dormer in contrast is a man who remembers too much. Hes contradictory volatile well-meaning weak angry and very very tired. Hes memorable.

Nolan who announced himself as a major talent with last years backward-running indie feature ""Memento"" is in the big leagues now. Though ""Insomnia"" is a relatively mainstream project hes lost none of his dense narrative control and he still takes pleasure in tightening the screws on a panicked character this time courtesy of an environment where the sun literally never sets. Pacino delivers his best performance in years as Will Dormer a veteran Los Angeles police detective whos sent along with his partner Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) to investigate the brutal murder of a 17-year-old girl in a small Alaskan village. Nolan and cinematographer Wally Pfister waste no time establishing an ominous tone as the detectives seaplane cruises through slate gray skies over a jagged landscape of ice and snow. Throughout the picture Nolan makes the most of city-slicker Pacino negotiating such inhospitable territory. Throw in the disorienting sunlight that keeps Dormer awake for days on end and you have a cop whos ready to crash and burn.

"Pacino Marvelous But Hes Not Alone - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Glacier Pacino Marvelous But Hes Not AloneMovies - REVIEW - InsomniaMay 24 2002|By Jay Boyar Sentinel Movie CriticFrom our first glimpse of him in Insomnia -- in a small plane above a gorgeous glacier -- Al Pacino looks tired.His eyes are puffy. His head is down. His whole face seems drawn and old. As Will Dormer Pacino is a Los Angeles police detective whos on his way to the Alaska town of Nightmute to solve the murder of a 17-year-old girl.But that murder isnt the only thing on Dormers mind. Back in L.A. the internal-affairs guys are cleaning house and everyone even a celebrated cop like him is nervous.Dormer feels especially vulnerable because his partner knows too much. And when during a stakeout in the fog the partner is shot Dormers concerns increase exponentially.Will anyone believe it was an accident? Was it in fact an accident?If Dormer looks weary before he hits town hes soon positively exhausted. It may be the white nights of Nightmute. It may be something else.Whatever it is hes not sleeping.Youre riveted by Pacinos performance At any given moment he makes you wonder how much of Dormers stamina is left -- and how much of his integrity.You listen to his voice with its Southern honey and ask yourself about his past. You search his eyes for portents. And just when you think youre down to his core he shows yet another layer.Brilliant as he is Pacino is not the only one in Insomina who does superb work. There is also Robin Williams as Finch an Alaskan novelist -- and murderer.This time there is nothing of the clown in Williams work. What he projects is a hauntingly bland intelligence. At his creepiest his face becomes an emotionless mask. The eyes are blank in a way that tells you his mind is racing plotting.This is the first Robin Williams movie in a long time in which you actually want to see more of him.Based on the 1997 Norwegian thriller Insomnia was written by newcomer Hillary Seitz and photographed with a sharp eye for the mysteries of personality by Wally Pfister. The new movie was directed by Christopher Nolan whose Memento was last years first top-notch film for adults. So its appropriate that Insomnia is the first one this year unless you count Mexicos casually seductive Y Tu Mama Tambien (and a couple of domestic late-to-arrive-locally 2001 films).Insomina doesnt have the devilishly clever structure that Memento did. But like Memento the new film is all about the intricacies of the human mind and its capacity for self-delusion.What Mementos inventive structure did for that film the performances do for this one They illuminate the conflicts and confusions within the minds of its characters.Insomnia has its flaws but nothing to lose sleep over.Theres a thrilling sequence in which Dormer chases Finch across floating logs and then plunges between them. The chase is all the more effective because its simply staged with none of the incoherent rapid editing of so many action flicks.But its disappointing that after Dormer is trapped beneath the logs the sequence ends without ingenuity.Theres a third terrific performance Hilary Swank (Boys Dont Cry) appears as Ellie an eager young Alaskan cop who idolizes Dormer.Her big toothy smile and worshipful eyes are a tonic for the old cop. Her respect for him reminds him of how much he once respected himself. And its fun for him to bask in her admiration to graciously play the wise mentor and quasi-celeb.Ellie can even quote his epigrams back to him. Noting Dormers sleeping problems she offers one up.""A good cop cant sleep because hes missing a piece of the puzzle"" she recalls. ""And a bad cop cant sleep because his conscience wont let him.""The character of Ellie is important in many ways. Her idealism suggests the way Dormer once felt; her respect for him tells us how skillful he is. And their relationship eerily mirrors the bond between Finch and the dead girl.But will Dormer betray his protegee as Finch betrayed his?Grown-ups who cant face Spider-Man or the new Star Wars movie Attack of the Clones -- the latter a miracle cure for insomina at least until its final action-packed section -- really should check this film out. This is one movie thats best appreciated by those whove lived enough to know something of lifes small accumulating cruelties. And the acting alone is worth the price of admission.For Pacino its like a return to the themes of Serpico nearly three decades ago. The big difference is that now hes the cop with something to hide not the one who exposes the slime.But the performances can stand side-by-side as two of the high points in his career. Even at the end when his character is utterly drained his work is never less than wide awake.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Pacino in one of the high points of his remarkable career plays Will Dormer an LAPD whiz sent to the Alaskan town of Nightmute to investigate the murder of a teenage girl. From the opener with Will and his partner Hap (Martin Donovan) flying over a glacier an atmosphere of unease is firmly established. The tension between the partners is palpable -- evidence-tampering on past cases can bring down both their careers if Hap spills what he knows to Internal Affairs. Will whose last name Dormer evokes sleep isnt getting any. And the Alaskan light is relentless. A sharp-eyed local cop Ellie Burr incisively played by Swank tells Will this is the season of the midnight sun when darkness just doesnt fall. Even when sleepless Will yanks the drapes shut in his hotel room the light glares. In Hillary Seitzs script loosely based on an austere 1997 Norwegian film of the same name the sun is a metaphor for a conscience that wont sleep. Such windy attitudinizing could break the spirit of a movie and an audience. Not here. Nolan matches his Memento achievement with another triumph of style and substance. Setting a trap for the killer on a misty beach Will accidentally shoots Hap. Or is it an accident? Will registers the fear in Haps eyes before he dies. So does the killer who watches in hiding. As Walter Finch a novelist who befriended the murdered girl Williams doesnt enter the film until near the midpoint but he brings a scary intensity to the role thats electrifying. Trying to establish a bond with Will first by phone then in a meeting on a ferry Walter talks with calm reason ""Killing changes you Will. Its like awareness."" Nolan stages a thrilling chase for cop and suspect across moving logs but its Walters psychological pursuit of Will that makes this one of the years best movies. As Will goes sleepless for six days Pacino -- looking more ravaged than he ever has onscreen -- lets us see this alert quick-witted cop slowly wrenchingly come unglued. Its a brilliant performance in a film that will keep you up nights. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.
