With Christina Ricci Samuel L. Jackson Justin Timberlake. Director Craig Brewer (155). R Sex nudity language violence drug use. At area theaters. In 2005 Craig Brewers ""Hustle amp; Flow"" taught us that its hard out there for a pimp. ""Black Snake Moan"" his murky stew of sexism and Southern stereotypes informs us that there ""aint but one kind of blues between man and woman."" What about the kind between lousy movies and the suckers who pay to see them? Although to be fair those who go to ""BSM"" will get exactly what they want a feverish Christina Ricci in full B-movie mode as itchy Tennessee nymphomaniac Rae. While its impossible to know what drew her to such a demeaning role it may have a little something to do with the attention any actress would get from writhing through a movie half-naked and chained at the waist begging for a mans - but I digress. When we first meet her Rae is sending her loyal boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) off to war in signature style. Once they put their clothes back on Ronnie leaves for boot camp and a wasted Rae goes looking for more lovin. Instead shes beaten raped and dumped by the side of dusty road where eccentric farmer Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds her. Of all possible responses to this dilemma Lazarus chooses to take Rae home leash her to the radiator and cure her of her ""wickedness."" Its hard to say why the appropriate outfit for this treatment is a tiny pair of underwear and a barely-there T-shirt but undoubtedly Brewer was working off solid professional instincts. So far so ridiculous. But then the movie strolls right past absurdity into offensiveness by trying to pass this pulp nonsense off as noble art. Drawing on the Bible and old blues songs Lazarus successfully revives Rae from her spiritual death taming her white-trash ways and turning her into a happier woman - one who speaks softly wears pretty dresses and even praise the Lord learns her way around a kitchen. At heart ""BSM"" is no different from the midnight movies of the 60s and 70s that reveled in a head-spinning blend of blatant exploitation provocative racial commentary and overwrought performances. But Brewer cant or wont own up to his baser instincts even as he indulges them. Anybody know a backwoods cure for cynical self-righteousness?

Starring Samuel L. Jackson Christina Ricci Justin Timberlake and S. Epatha Merkerson. Directed by Craig Brewer. (R. 116 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Lets talk about sex in the cinema. Theres not a whole lot of it anymore. You dont think about missing the titillation of communal voyeurism until a sexually charged movie like ""Black Snake Moan"" comes along. Sparks practically fly out into the audience when Christina Ricci as the town nymphomaniac Rae is overcome with a desire that causes her pelvis to twitch. Rae slinks around in denim short shorts and cut-off T-shirts if she has any top on at all. Sexuality also is communicated in subtle ways. Samuel L. Jackson as a farmer named Lazarus (for a reason that becomes obvious) gives a lady friend homemade body cream spiced with ginger and their next time together she leans over so he can smell it on her. Writer-director Craig Brewer again demonstrates as he did in ""Hustle amp; Flow"" that he has stories to tell unlike anything manufactured in Hollywood. Lazarus still smarting from his wifes leaving him for his brother discovers Rae bloodied on the road where a one-night stand has dumped her after punching her repeatedly in the face. Lazarus makes it his mission to cure her mania by chaining Rae to his farmhouse radiator. ""Snakes"" distributor should have held off releasing it until later in the year so Jackson and Ricci would be remembered come Oscar time. Their performances hover just below over-the-top an admirable accomplishment when youre yanking on a chain for half the movie. ""Black Snake Moan"" is set in the South not the new one in Atlanta but the old one of ""Tobacco Road."" Brewers audacious script manages to feel both fresh and retro. While the film is very much of a place specifically rural Tennessee (captured in all its faded glory by a wide-screen format usually used in Westerns) it could be happening any time. When Raes boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) enlists in the Army its unclear whether hes off to Iraq Vietnam or even Korea. Only a reference to the Internet where an oddball ancillary character (one of many) found her snake boots tips you that its the 21st century. Tennessee Williams may be the last writer before Brewer to conjure up a nymphomaniac. Feminists long ago put the kibosh on the notion that there was anything pathological about being highly sexed. But you believe that Rae is afflicted. Shes so out of control that while Lazarus is away she grabs a teenage farmhand who comes to the door. He departs no longer a virgin. Brewer captures the cadences of Southerners speech. Listening to Lazarus talk is a chamber piece in itself and thats before he picks up a guitar and starts crooning. Who knew that Jackson could sing the blues as well as act them? His Lazarus who gave up playing juke joints for marriage is an angry man trying to keep the lid on his emotions. He genuinely wants to help Rae. Theres a gentleness in the way he picks her up and carefully washes her wounds. (The tiny Ricci looks like a child in Jacksons arms.). But his new ward is also a diversion someone to concentrate on rather than his cheating wife. Jackson shares some sweet moments with S. Epatha Merkerson (""Law and Order"") as a pharmacist Lazarus has his eye on. Their delicate flirtation shows another side of him and is in sharp contrast to the tumultuous relationship between Rae and Ronnie who suffers from paralyzing anxiety attacks. Thats several people who need healing and an exceptionally strong cast makes you care about each of them. Timberlakes role is small but pivotal and he has a commanding presence. His love scene with Ricci is steamy. This is one singer with a future on the big screen. Brewer named his movie after a blues song. The line about ""black snakes crawling over me"" plays on a fear of the unknown. ""Black Snake Moan"" is a trip to that unfamiliar territory well worth tagging along on. -- Advisory Nudity and sexuality.

Photo Paramount Vantage Black Snake Moan 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Sumpin is wrong with Rae a wild youngn who gives herself over to drugs and brutish men. Bible-beatin Lazarus is gonna hafta get her right. Backwoods bluntness fires Black Snake Moan like a blues lick that stands your hair on end. Its a steamy searing saga of rigorous redemption confronting creepy Southern seediness. But its not nearly the wake-up call it could have been. Thats because Rae (a fiery Christina Ricci) winds up off the hook. Sure she makes bad choices. But the dark fact is she was absued as a child and writer-director Craig Brewer (Hustle amp; Moan) uses that to excuse her wanton self-destructiveness. You see the girl cant help it. She yearns to burn and doesnt need harsh lessons to light her way. She needs emotional support structure and therapy. Like it or not she also needs Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) a dirt-poor farmer who finds her battered body lying just a tobacco-spit from his tractor. He carries Rae to his shabby home cleans her up and cares for her until she comes around. Then being Rae shes ready to ramble. Only trouble is shes chained to the radiator. Celebs may indulge in revolving-door rehab without consequence but not Rae. ""God put you in my path and I aim to cure you of your wickedness"" Lazarus declares with a sternness born of bitter failure. Having once played the blues he now lives them suffering since his wife left him for his brother. Rae protests but Lazarus ""aint gonna be moved. You aint right yet"" he says as if that settles it. It doesnt and a war of wills erupts. Parading in panties and rebel tank top Rae restlessly roams the house yanking furiously on her long chain when shes not chain-smoking. But thats just a setup. Things change with the return of Raes hapless boyfriend Ronnie (a surprisingly soulful Justin Timberlake). Busted from the military for crumbling under stress hes as troubled as Rae but also like her hes just another damaged yet blameless lost soul. Lazarus sense-talking Bible-thumping tough-love is wasted on the wrong targets. Grumpy sermons wont set them straight. They need purity hope and absence of temptation for their fragile resolve. Chains of iron or love can provide that for only so long. Thus provocative entertainment is served while a meaningful message is squandered. From everyday kids to hard-partying stars more than the South is stained by hedonism. But for many it springs not from emotional scars but from a lack someone in their lives who cares enough to say no. Someone stern and firm -- someone like Lazarus. Played by Jackson with flamboyant verve and blues-singing revelations he could have warned of dead-ends ahead. Instead the film skirts accountability through guilt-free circumstance while indulging in a lurid excess of its own. bruce.westbrookchron.com Todays Deals Columbia Rapid Rivers II Mens Shirt for 20 + free shipping American Airlines Nationwide Fares from 38 1-way Marc New York Womens Lace Sheath Dress for 26 + 8 samp;h Banzai Wigglin Water Sprinkler for 7 + pickup at Walmart Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Jackson in ""Black Snake Moan"" This is a cure? Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Black Snake Moan"" with Samuel L. Jackson Christina Ricci Justin Timberlake John Cothran S. Epatha Merkerson. Written and directed by Craig Brewer. 116 minutes. Rated R for strong sexual content language some violence and drug use. Several theaters. ""Black Snake Moan"" Craig Brewers turgid follow-up to the pimp drama ""Hustle amp; Flow"" is the story of a slut who finds redemption through being chained to a radiator -- and yes its just about that subtle. Its an exploitation film fraught with faux-sincerity and ultimately its utterly ridiculous. Some good actors waste their time wading around in this overlong mess and some good blues music is squandered. Christina Ricci hair tangled and huge eyes staring plays Rae the young woman at the movies center. Shes a white-trash Camille coughing honkingly into her fist while striding around her Southern town in little more than a T-shirt and cowboy boots. And shes insatiable Barely moments after her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) heads out with the military shes doing the nasty with another man. As they say about her around town girl got an itch. And presumably because such girls need to be punished were treated to a rape sequence after which Rae is dumped onto the side of a road. Enter Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) a blues-loving God-fearing fellow whose wife has just left him. He decides to help this nymphomaniac waif and his brand of help includes a 50-foot chain a metal radiator a bathtub full of ice and a lot of talk. ""God seen fit to put you in my path"" he says ""and Im going to cure your wickedness."" Maybe its all meant to be funny but the sight of Riccis bruised and near-naked body (shes barely clothed for much of the film) didnt make me want to laugh. She howls like a banshee and writhes like the Devil himself is within her; what she never does is create a character because there isnt one there. The appropriate response to ""Black Snake Moan"" is indeed a moan but not the good kind.

"Black Snake Moan Crazier than a rattlers den | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBlack Snake Moan Crazier than a rattlers denBecause it features Samuel L. Jackson in fully cranked smiting and motherf--king mode and especially because it features a nearly naked Christina Ricci chained to a radiator for most of its running time I doubt many viewers will object that Craig Brewers Black Snake Moan - a rattler-bit-crazy slice of trashed-up Tennessee gothic - doesnt really make much sense.By Geoff PevereEntertainment ColumnistFri. March 2 2007  (out of 4)Starring Samuel L. Jackson Christina Ricci Justin Timberlake S. Epatha Merkerson. Written and directed by Craig Brewer.115 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued BelowBecause it features Samuel L. Jackson in fully cranked smiting and motherf--king mode and especially because it features a nearly naked Christina Ricci chained to a radiator for most of its running time I doubt many viewers will object that Craig Brewers Black Snake Moan - a rattler-bit-crazy slice of trashed-up Tennessee gothic - doesnt really make much sense.Its not exactly the plot youll be thinking about later.Starting with Riccis apparently nymphomaniacal Rae in deep farewell rut with her Iraq-bound boyfriend Ronnie (Justin ""SexyBack"" Timberlake) the movie proceeds to track her quick flushing straight down the moral toilet.Sex with a drug dealer is followed by a public sporting event that lends an entirely new dimension to the notion of touch football - and ultimately into the middle of the gravel back road where shes discovered bloody unconscious and dressed only in panties and midriff-flashing Confederate T-shirt by the anger-prone former blues player Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson - grey-haired balding formidable).Recognizing Raes desperate state but harbouring some issues of his own - like wanting to kill his ex-wife brother and just about anyone who looks at him askance - Lazarus heads out for medical supplies.After nursing the scantily clad young sex casualty through a few days of flashback-injected high delirium he eventually comes to the same decision any reasonable man under the circumstances would he uses the kind of chain usually reserved for dragging pickup trucks out of swamps to secure his guest to the radiator. Needless to say this image - of a black man chaining a nearly naked white woman less than half his age to a radiator somewhere in the Deep South - isnt without its peculiar resonance.But despite the fact that the freshly revived Rae (who as we learn has ""an itch"" based in an incident of past abuse) almost instantly wraps herself around Lazarus in exchange for freedom the big bluesmans interest isnt in what some of his more respected musical colleagues might have called ""grindin.""No its salvation Lazarus seeks both Raes - whom Lazarus promises to ""cure of your wickedness"" - and his own. His conspicuous delay in providing her with adequate clothing notwithstanding he aims to bring out the goodness in her. In the hands of Baby Doll-era Tennessee Williams or maybe Flannery OConnor at her backwoods mossiest Black Snake Moan might have managed to sustain the state of sweaty piously perverted delirium such a set-up practically begs for.But writer-director Craig Brewer whose last film was the similarly Southern-fried redemptive musical melodrama Hustleamp;Flow allows his movie to stall into talky pontificating confusion as Lazarus keeps up his moralizing and the private sphere of the bluesmans shack becomes increasingly invaded by outside intruders.(One a teenage delivery boy leaves more than the parcel behind.)But the way of the redeemer is both difficult and true otherwise how to account for the fact that everyone - especially Rae - seems to get over the chained-to-the-radiator business so quickly? Lazarus must be right or else he wouldnt be played by Samuel L. Jackson.Opening with an old TV interview on the subject of men women and blues with the late singer Son House Brewers music-caked movie seems to be striving for the elemental gutbucket lyricism of an old blues song.But if it proves anything its that the pared-down parables of blood revenge desire and the devil that work for voice and guitar can come across as plumb stupid when literalized as movie drama. Almost guaranteed to provide equal appeal to camp cultists and horny frat-boy freeze framers Black Snake Moan would be both a lot more fun and a lot more dangerous if it convinced you that there was some kind of coherent guiding sensibility behind its provocations.But despite its considerable unwholesome appeal the movie gives us the feeling it has been chained up as well and that chain wont let it go any farther than a single outrageous idea. Truly this is why the black snake moans.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsWhen and why Sophie Gregoire Trudeau accepts designer giftsFive fashion gifts given to Sophie Gregoire Trudeau have come to light recently with some people criticizing her acceptance of them though the items fall within Canadian conflict of interest guidelines.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Jackson) chains the town tramp (Christina Ricci) to his radiator in ""Black Snake Moan.""Show Caption of Expand By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED February 28 2007 at 349 pm | UPDATED May 8 2016 at 1257 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Former Japanese consulate residence hits the Denver market for 4.2 million Sports Authority plans to pay top executives 2.85 million in bankruptcy bonuses Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Blake Shelton plays free intimate show at Denvers Grizzly Rose Tennis-ball-sized hail knocks out 27 Colorado Springs police cars Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Race class the South and the historically volatile pairing of a black man and a white woman. These are some of the fixins writer-director Craig Brewer tosses into his outrageous stewpot ""Black Snake Moan."" In the hands of a more subtle filmmaker those themes might be the ingredients for a truth-and-reconciliation tale. ""Black Snake Moan"" is a myth-and-reconciliation story with outlandish scenes meant to make you laugh make you uncomfortable. Both. Brewers bold debut feature ""Hustle amp; Flow"" was an overly flavored redemption tale willing to imagine the oversized emotions of ""the little people."" Upon seeing it at the Sundance Film Festival one critic declared it ""rubbish."" Even more than that film the Tabascod emotions of ""Black Snake Moan"" will not be to everyones tastes. After all the central drama of the film comes when a dark tall black man chains a very small white woman to a radiator. In fact Brewers neo-Southern Gothic tale is one of those films that makes you fret about the shorthand of star ratings. Its good but. ... A fellow critic and I agreed that the movie was utterly outrageous. What we never reached detente on was whether in going too far Brewer had pushed the issue of race and sex far enough. An energized Samuel L. Jackson steps into the work boots of Lazarus. The one-time bluesman has long ago shoved his guitars beneath his bed. Hes dedicated to his butter beans and other crops on his modest Tennessee farm. ""Im not ready to grow old"" his estranged wife tells him on her way out of town. And there is something emotionally dormant if not dead in Lazarus. Christina Ricci plays Rae a foul-mouthed poor white woman with a neurotically fueled feverish sex drive. Rae has a suitably codependent mate in Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) who suffers from panic attacks. They sooth each other just enough to cut down on their bouts of panic and need. But as the film opens Ronnie is headed to basic training at a National Guard base perhaps even deployment in Iraq. Fight as Rae might when Ronnie leaves the girl goes wild a fact Ronnies cad of a buddy Gil exploits. When we first meet Lazarus hes about to see his wife. Leaning against a car he tells his friend and pastor R.L (portrayed with sturdy compassion by John Cothran) ""I never put a hand on her in anger."" This is helpful information. Because when Lazarus finds Rae battered on the dirt road he takes her home. When he learns shes the towns tramp he decides to perform a righteous intervention. The oversized padlock that keeps Rae chained to a radiator shouts chastity belt with cartoonish intent. Dont believe me? Raes breakneck attempt to escape brings her up short like a chained animated hound trying to get at Sylvester the cat. An encounter between Rae and a sweet teen named Lincoln is willfully sillier - and scarier. Do not underestimate the risk of certain roles on the psyche of a performer. Raes ""itch"" as local drug thug Tehronne (David Banner) describes it comes from a dark place. And Ricci works hard to link her characters bad-girl antics with anguish. Still a green director Brewer makes errors in judgment. For instance he keeps Rae in a state of undress more in keeping with a Maxim magazine cover than consistent with the man Lazarus is. Theres a lot of love of place and folk in ""Black Snake Moan."" The electric carbine whine of insects in the Tennessee sticks is just one sound of authenticity. Brewer begins his movie with scratchy black-and-white footage of bluesman Son House talking about the roots of his craft. ""Theres only one kind of blues"" the philosopher says ""that consists between male and female."" Hes wrong. But its his artistic truth. The same might be said of Brewer.

Comments Black Snake Moan Written and directed by Craig Brewer (Hustle amp; Flow) this provocative parable suffers from far-fetched premises bad montage sequences and facile symbolism. But any movie that can make Samuel L. Jackson convincing as a great Memphis bluesman must be doing something right. Christina Ricci barely recognizable plays a drug-addled nymphomaniac Jackson finds passed out in the road chains like a dog in his shack and sets out to ""cure."" Brewer knows how to guide his leads through this improbable story and he kept me interested in spite of everything. John Singleton served as coproducer. R 116 min.

"Black Snake Moan is exploitative but its also electric - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Black Snake Moan is exploitative but its also electric Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) chains up a sex addict (Christina Ricci left) in ""Black Snake Moan."" (photos by bruce talamon/paramount vantage via associated press) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  March 2 2007 Maybe its because Christina Riccis tattered Confederate halter-top has a flag for each breast. Maybe its because Samuel L. Jackson  in the most interesting performance hes given in years looks like both Sanford and son. Or maybe its because Justin Timberlake has a significant part in a movie where everybody sings but him. But Craig Brewers ""Black Snake Moan"" is why I go to the movies.Theres a special thrill in watching a filmmaker momentarily lose his mind. Even before Jacksons character a farming Memphis bluesman named Lazarus chains Riccis sex addict up to his radiator Brewers movie is a hot-blooded provocation about lust and race though not necessarily at the same time. Its out to shock and entertain. This movie is crazy but the insanity is electric.""Black Snake Moan"" is about a womans attempt to kick her nasty habit. But it also feels like a directors attempt to kick his own misogyny. Brewers last movie was ""Hustle amp; Flow"" in which Terrence Howard played a pimp with a trio of hookers who got on his nerves. The women were 57 varieties of skanky but rarely human. ""Black Snake Moan"" feels like a gradual atonement for the previous movies limited imagination regarding women in the eyes of men. Brewer can now imagine a man lifting a finger to help a woman in need. Admittedly the help is outrageous Riccis wastrel Rae wakes up with a stud-link anchor chain wrapped around her inexplicably toned waist.She finds herself in this position after her jittery soldier boyfriend Ronnie (Timberlake)  leaves for basic training. His ride has barely pulled away from his country shack when Rae collapses in the grass and writhes in excruciated ecstasy jamming her hands between her legs Yes shes gotta have it and have it she does proverbially -- no wait almost literally -- with every Tom Dick and Harry in town. Sassy and sleazy shes a walking talking mud flap. (One of her regulars is the local pimp played by the dirty-sexy rapper David Banner  whose drawl constitutes a foreign language.)After a long night of bopping around a party drunk tripping on OxyContin  and being left on a lawn with all the other refuse Rae is assaulted and dumped on the side of the road like a half-empty Cinch Sack. Old Lazarus finds her bloodied and barely dressed the following morning as hes taking out his own garbage. Lazarus was on a bender himself the night before. His wife just left him for his younger brother and he messed up his house in miserable celebration.As a matter of safety  Lazarus scoops up Rae and takes her into his home. He does some snooping around town worried that whoever did this to her might be black. (Not so.) But as Banners pimp reports shes just a nympho in need of a cure ""Collar that dawg"" he says. And so after Rae slithers and wails on the living room floor -- still bloodied and half-naked -- and Lazaruss attempts at a Holy Bible exorcism fail his rehab turns hard - core and out come the chains. ""Look girl"" Jackson explains the gospel of disgust rising in his voice in that chilling Samuel L. Jackson way ""You been running wild"" Of course finding her a clean pair of short shorts seems to take longer than cleansing her soul.""Black Snake Moan"" builds to Riccis enslavement with a surprising sense of drama. The soundtrack deploys thundering rhythmic blues that seem to get louder with every scene. Brewer convincingly declares himself a serious exploitation director. His movie is like Roger Corman directing Timbaland and Nelly Furtado in a deep-fried version of ""Caged Heat.""Next to shameless showmanship regional authenticity is his other big asset. Hes a white guy from Memphis and his decision to leave rap music alone for this new picture and try the blues is smart. For one thing it makes room for the juke-joint drama that was missing in the risible recording sessions of ""Hustle amp; Flow.""More crucially the blues is capacious enough for the sexual and romantic ache that hip-hop is too macho to admit. In his first movie Brewer got lucky since Terrence Howard put blues-tinged longing in his rapping pimp. But ""Black Snake Moan"" rumbles with real hurt.The movie whose title comes from a Blind Lemon Jefferson song is bookended with the spiritually restless Delta Blues pioneer Son House  who is shown in several archival cutaways. But the music seeps into the dialogue in some early scenes between Lazarus and his wife (Adriane Lenox ) that might as well be from a Buddy Guy-Koko Taylor duet. And Jackson reaches into himself showing all manners of disgust shame rage heartbreak and -- how could I forget -- complete derangement. Not since ""Jungle Fever"" has he been so vulnerably human.Ricci is so good at being so sub human that youre forced to wonder if shes just more perceptive than the rest of us. Is there a woman in that character? Scarcely. But resembling no one so much as a baby Susan Sarandon (those wide feral eyes) she goes at the part with mind-boggling abandon anyway. Both she and Jackson give themselves over to Brewers nuttiness in a way that forces you to wonder during every single scene What were they thinking?By the second half of the picture Brewer starts to come to his senses and the movie loses its kick. When the chains come off Rae he more or less applies them himself. Its as if the power of the movies sexual absurdity scared him too. Soon we learn of Raes tragic childhood. Then Timberlakes soldier comes home and the movie turns into a psychologizing melodrama about redemption and reconciliation. None of the sexual-racial lines the movie seems hurtling toward are crossed.The loss of nerve is a letdown that feels like both a commercial concession and a way to keep the peace. Had the old black man and the young white chick gotten it on I think some audiences might have exploded. Perhaps sensing this ""Black Snake Moan"" backs off giving us a neat and clean Hallmark card ending that leaves you worried that Brewers sexorcism did a number on him too.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Black Snake Moan reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Black Snake Moan reviewed. Black Snake Moan reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 1 2007 631 PM Its Hard Out There for a Ho The puzzling sexual games of Black Snake Moan. By Dana Stevens Christina Ricci in Black Snake Moan You only had to see the blaxploitation-style poster of Christina Ricci chained and kneeling at Samuel L. Jacksons feet to know that Black Snake Moan (Paramount Classics) was going to be a provocative rebel yell of a movie. A middle-aged black man in the South chains a young white woman to his radiator to cure her of nymphomania and succeeds What a rich exploration of racial and sexual archetypes What a daring challenge to viewers expectations Or maybe What bullshit. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I guarantee that the words provocative bold and courageous will be bandied about in discussions of this movie and they wont be entirely misplaced. Writer and director Craig Brewer who made 2005s Hustle and Flow has a fine sense of locale (here the Tennessee countryside) a way of coaxing thrilling performances from actors and terrific taste in music. But can we just start with something very basic here? Chaining someone to your radiator is wrong. Depriving a near-naked and recently assaulted stranger of the most basic physical liberty for days on end is a sick perverse and cruel thing to do. Black Snake Moan appears to be--or worse pretends to be--oblivious to that simple fact. And that obliviousness makes all of the movies supposed risk-taking seem more like exploitation. Advertisement Before I get ahead of myself with analysis let me go back and set up the movie. We open on a scene of Rae (Ricci) desperately banging her boyfriend (Justin Timberlake) whos Iraq-bound with the National Guard. Moments after seeing Ronnie off with a promise to be true Rae is getting dirty with a burly black drug dealer. That same night she gets high at a party has semiconsensual sex on a football field and is subsequently raped beaten and left for dead by Ronnies best friend. Its hard out there for a ho--until Rae meets Lazarus the embittered farmer and former bluesman played by Samuel Jackson who finds Rae by the side of the road and takes her in. Sprawled half-conscious on the couch inside Lazarus country shack Rae displays signs of ""the sickness"" a kind of erotic fever whose symptoms include writhing in panties and scratching at ones thighs. Lazarus determined to drive out the demons from this suffering young woman submerges her in an ice-cold bath (actually a terrible way to treat a fever but lets hope no one is watching this movie for first-aid advice) reads to her from the Bible and eventually padlocks her to the radiator with that large clanking chain. All this sounds like the setup for Saw or Hostel a sadistic B-movie about sexual torture and humiliation. Instead Black Snake Moan morphs into a wacky intergenerational bonding movie something closer to Harold and Maude or The Karate Kid with a dusting of Southern grit. Lazarus and Rae as it turns out arent a couple but twins Stubborn damaged and lonely they each need something from the other. She I guess needs to be chained and he needs to chain someone but just for a little while--until they both learn how to trust again. Bondage and captivity are this movies meet-cute. With the help of a folksy preacher (John Cothran Jr.) and a preternaturally nice pharmacist (S. Epatha Merkerson) Lazarus and Raes relationship segues seamlessly from imprisonment into a cozy father-daughter bond. Toward the end when a transformed Rae is seen wearing a gold belly chain its even suggested that the piece of jewelry represents the spiritual journey the two lost souls have taken together. But theres nothing symbolic about the large heavy metal chain binding and bruising Riccis impossibly tiny waist for the first part of this movie. Im sorry but in the age of Abu Ghraib and Alberto Gonzales torture memos it seems important to say it again Chaining people and holding them against their will is not the right thing to do. By that I dont mean simplistically that Jacksons character is ""bad"" and should be punished at the end of the film. I mean that the questions--ethical sexual racial whatever--that are raised by this initial act of violence are never addressed. Just as in Hustle and Flow theres an unsubtle message here that race trumps gender. In that movie Terrence Howards character was meant to remain the focus of our attention and sympathy even after he threw one of his hookers out into the street with her baby as punishment for talking back. I never forgave the character for that act and by the end of the movie I couldnt have given a shit whether he achieved rap fame or not (with the ""boo-hoo Im a pimp"" song that he neither wrote nor sang by himself but ran around taking full credit for). Black Snake Moans misogyny is a little subtler than Hustle and Flows not least because of Christina Riccis subtle and compassionate rendering of what could have been a one-note character. In interviews Brewer makes it clear that ""nymphomania"" is a nonexistent condition an invention of cultural fantasy. But youd never know that from watching Black Snake Moan which would rather indulge that fantasy than provide its own characters with credible motivations. Riccis character spends days in nothing but a cut-off Confederate-flag T-shirt and white panties--the outfit in which Lazarus found her raped and beaten by the side of the road. If Lazarus is supposed to be so concerned with Raes well-being not to mention immune to her sexual appeal wouldnt he insist she change into one of his clean shirts right away? Brewer stirs the pot with commendable bravado but he seems curiously uninterested in thinking through the issues of race and gender that he himself raises. Rae and Lazarus--but particularly Rae--are archetypes one minute characters the next depending on the emotional reaction the movie needs from its audience in any given scene. On a tangential note--or maybe not so tangential--its sad to see Christina Riccis barely covered skeleton offered up as an object of salacious contemplation. Shes so thin her head looks like a lollipop on a stick. Riccis lush physicality has always been of a piece with the offbeat roles she chooses to take on a bodacious ""fuck you"" to Hollywood standards.I loved her curvy form in Buffalo 66 The Opposite of Sex and Monster those childlike bug-eyes contrasting with that voluptuous womanly shape. But in Black Snake Moan (and in the ubiquitous press photos accompanying its rollout) Ricci has dieted herself into near-invisibility. Is this level of scrawniness even appropriate for the character? If the town slut in backwoods Tennessee cant have a little meat on her bones who can? Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

With Christina Ricci Samuel L. Jackson. (105 min.)Samuel L. Jackson plays Lazarus a God-fearing bluesman whose wife ran out on him. Then Christina Riccis Rae turns up. Lets just say that she has an anxiety disorder that requires the services of a large portion of the male population. Left alone after her nervous-wreck husband Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) heads for boot camp she ends up in Lazaruss clutches. Hoping to cure her trampiness he literally chains her to his radiator in order to talk some sense into her. The film is named after a blues song. Maybe Jackson should avoid any more movies with ""snake"" in the title. Grade D - Peter RainerFull of It (PG-13)Director Christian Charles. With Teri Polo and Ryan Pinkston. (93 min.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Diminutive math whiz Sam Leonard (Ryan Pinkston) transfers to Bridgeport High more concerned about fitting in than with earning a scholarship. A counselor suggests that he tell lies to become popular. Of course everyone laughs at his claims of basketball prowess and irresistibility to Carmen Electra. When the lies start coming true Sam alienates his best friend and starts failing math courtesy of his dogs sudden appetite for homework papers. This throwaway teen fantasy has its moments but it appears as if the dog ate the script. Grade C-- M.K. Terrell Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test?

With Tim Allen John Travolta Martin Lawrence William H. Macy. (99 min.)The subculture of weekend warrior bikers is such rich comic material that the ineptitude of ""Wild Hogs"" is doubly offensive. At first its amusing that this quartet (Allen Travolta Lawrence and Macy) would want to slap on the leather jackets and skull bandanas and do the ""Easy Rider"" thing. But since none of these characters resemble anything more than a kiddie cartoon adult the fun fades fast.

With Heather Graham Thomas Cavanaugh Bridget Moynahan. (96 min.)A brother and sister both fall for the same woman in this sitcom-ish comedy that rarely raises a titter. Heather Graham plays the sister and her sunniness and wide saucer eyes wear out their welcome fast. Graham was good in films such as ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Bowfinger"" where her apparent innocence was a smoke screen for her lustful connivance.

"Black Snake Moan Plenty of Bite washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Black Snake Moan Plenty of Bite Samuel L. Jackson stars as a broken man trying to hold to his Christian beliefs in this bold combination of redemption and brazen lasciviousness. (Photos By Bruce Talamon -- Paramount Vantage Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 2 2007 When ""Hustle amp; Flow"" burst on to movie screens two years ago it made a racket Not only did the movie present a breakout performance by Terrence Howard as a pimp turned rapper but it seemed to announce a whole new kind of film a genre-busting mash-up of urban exploitation flick rap musical hymn to the American Dream and down-and-dirty comedy. Now from the same filmmaker comes ""Black Snake Moan"" an equally audacious if not as thoroughly realized glimpse into a world rarely portrayed on screen. ""Black Snake Moan"" makes its intentions known right at the outset in an opening scene wherein Rae (Christina Ricci) and her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) engage in passionate sex in their trailer in rural Mississippi. (The film is bracketed by blues great Son House delivering a soliloquy on love and the blues.) Ronnie is on his way to boot camp and it soon becomes clear that neither of them can handle the separation. Plagued by anxiety he throws up in the bathroom and as soon as he leaves a similarly overcome Rae goes on a drinking-drugging-indiscriminate-sex binge that leaves her in a bruised heap on the side of a dusty road. Presumably left for dead Rae is discovered by Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) a truck farmer with his own problems. Fueled by Old Testament rage and spiritual fire Laz carries Rae back to his modest house where he nurses her back to health. When he asks around town and finds out about her round-heeled past he takes it upon himself to ""cure"" her of her ""wickedness"" chaining her to his radiator until the sex demon is driven plum out of her. In interviews ""Black Snake Moans"" writer-director Craig Brewer has suggested that his new film is about healing redemption and forgiveness. But if youve seen the posters you know its also about the nubile Ricci -- who spends most of the movie clothed only in a cut-off Confederate flag T-shirt and bikini panties -- wrapping herself provocatively in a 40-pound chain. Such is the cognitive dissonance of watching a movie thats trying to balance moral seriousness Southern Gothic excess and pure pulp pleasure. Its a difficult needle to thread and Brewer gets it right as often as he goes too far. As he did in ""Hustle amp; Flow"" Brewer again evinces an acute eye and ear for the American South he so clearly loves from the sugar shacks and juke joints to the contemplative expanse of a green bean field. And like that film ""Black Snake Moan"" is full of terrific music and indelible poetic images such as when Laz takes a backhoe to his former wifes garden (called ""Roses Roses""). Jackson as always is the epitome of charisma and strength as a broken man trying to stay true to his Christian principles the only way he knows how; but the movie belongs to Ricci who despite her doll-like physique dominates the screen with a fearless vanity-free performance. But as well intentioned as Brewer seems to be theres a sense that hes having his cake and eating it too as he both comments on lurid Samp;M imagery and engages in it. At one point Rae seduces one of Lazs neighbors an innocent kid who just happens to knock on the door at the wrong time; she comes at him like a lusty she-devil and later Laz and the boy share a wink and a laugh over the whole thing. Whether intended as campy humor or something deeper its a misfire. The motives are just as murky when Rae newly freed from her primitive compulsions after a late-night session listening to Laz sing the blues dances lasciviously while he plays slide guitar at a local juke. Are we supposed to cheer that she can bump and grind against everyone in the club without sleeping with them -- or simply ogle? Having chosen such larger-than-life characters in a story so highly pitched so metaphorically freighted and so steeped in Southern history and myth Brewer too often forces the message with big theatrical gestures making it difficult for viewers to see Laz and Rae and their neighbors simply as human. But human they are and that point is driven home in the films final scenes which bring the volume level down and unfold with surprising tenderness and emotion. If ""Black Snake Moan"" is uneven thats because Brewer has set himself to a higher degree of difficulty than most emerging filmmakers telling stories rarely seen on screen with equally rare characters and settings. Craig Brewer is definitely up to something and its gratifying to watch him explore new cinematic territory with such conviction and assurance. Black Snake Moan (116 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for strong sexual content profanity some violence and drug use.

"Black Snake Moan | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; black-snake-moan ) Black Snake Moan (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Black Snake Moan is designed to look and sound like a B-grade exploitation flick. It opens with a hot sex scene followed shortly thereafter by the sight of a girl writhing on the ground in apparent sexual frustration. Later theres booze and blues and black-and-blue marks. Theres a (white) girl in chains and a (black) man holding the key. The film pushes more buttons than an elevator operator but in the end Black Snake Moan works to turn expectations upside down. The movie has things to say about race and religion and the pain of loneliness and it does so with considerable offbeat wit. It introduces three broken people and shows how a little understanding can salve wounds if not completely heal them. Rae (Christina Ricci) is a bad girl with an ugly past. She has been saved from herself by Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) a guy with issues of his own. But Ronnie is leaving - despite pleas from his girlfriend he has decided to join the army as the first step on a path to his future. His departure wrecks Rae and less than a day after Ronnie is gone she has slipped back into her old ways of promiscuity and drugs. After being used and abused she is unceremoniously dropped onto the side of a lonely stretch of rural road. There she lies until the next morning when she is discovered by Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) an aging ex-blues guitarist whose own life is in tatters. His wife has left him and all he has left are the vegetables he grows in his garden. He takes Rae in and nurses her back to health. He gives her cough syrup an ice bath to break her fever and petroleum jelly for her scrapes and wounds. He also gives her a 40 pound chain to keep her from running away. It is his mission to teach her to mend her wicked ways. Things dont work out as either of them plan. It should come as no surprise that Black Snake Moan is about the resurrection of Lazarus. In fact not only does he come back to life but so does Rae. Looking at the film from a very high level it has a familiar theme that of two mismatched people finding each other and through their interaction courting redemption. But writer/director Craig Brewer (Hustle and Flow) doesnt treat this in an ordinary way. His approach is audacious to say the least and every time the movie appears to be headed into familiar territory Brewer twists it sometimes violently. There is for example no romantic relationship between Rae and Lazarus. Initially Rae tries to seduce him (doing some rather interesting things with one of her feet) but he resists and she eventually stops. Their interaction while not exactly father/daughter is platonic. There is also a gut wrenching confrontation between Rae and her mother that is not followed with a ""happily ever after"" scene. As is often the case with ambitious approaches to familiar material Brewer missteps occasionally. Ronnies character is left half-developed. There are times when Rae treads close to the edge of being a caricature. And many of the secondary characters are uninteresting at best. (An exception John Cothran Jr. as a preacher.) Yet Brewer gets the most important things right. We end up caring about Rae and Lazarus and what happens to them. The best scene of the film focuses on them together while apart. He is rediscovering life by playing the blues in front of a packed crowd and she is on the dance floor moving her body to his rhythms. Rae is fully clothed in this scene but its the sexiest Black Snake Moan has to offer. Riccis performance is brave and effective - the most provocative in a career that has rejected Hollywood norms. Her diverse choice of roles has allowed her to make the transition from precocious child actor to mature adult performer and Rae may be her riskiest portrayal to date. She lays it all on the line in Black Snake Moan wedding physical and psychic nakedness in an example of riveting acting. Samuel L. Jackson on the other hand tones down his natural flamboyance. This is not the man who made profane demands in another Snake movie. This is a weary individual who has been beaten down by life. Jackson has played this sort of role before but it takes a film like Black Snake Moan to remind us that hes more than a comic book action hero. Justin Timberlake is okay but hes not nearly as effective as in Alpha Dog. Despite its tendency to go over-the-top I found Black Snake Moan to be both engaging and moving. I cared about the characters and was interested in their circumstances. Theres a lot of eye candy too. Ricci spends most of the film either half naked or more than that and its plain that she did a lot of work on her body to prepare for this part. Brewer contributes some memorable images. Lazarus blues concert is masterfully filmed and theres a wonderful shot near the beginning that shows Rae walking down a road toward the camera with a giant machine dwarfing her. Brewer doesnt preach but he says a lot and he does it with flair and occasional bursts of twisted humor. The yin and yang of Rae and Lazarus interaction makes statements about race and gender and how history informs the way we relate to each other today. Theres a lot going on in the films subtext and it becomes more obvious as the plot unfolds. In the end however one message is clear regardless of race sex or class were all human were all screwed up and we all have the potential to heal each other. The movie ends on a note that is simultaneously real and hopeful and does not in any way betray what has unfolded over the past two hours. This is a bold follow-up to Hustle and Flow. Would that more filmmakers and actors took these kinds of risks. Black Snake Moan (United States 2007) Director Craig Brewer Cast Samuel L.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Killer Movie David Finchers Zodiac is no Se7en but itll still give you the willies. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis (Photo Merrick Morton/Courtesy of Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures) David Fincher the director of Zodiac is rumored to be a cold SOB but thats not a bad thing if youre a thriller specialist. A penchant for treating audiences like lab rats and actors like specimens in jars can even be an asset Finchers Se7en with its artfully rendered tableaux morts is a genre cornerstone a Louvre for necrophiliacs. Zodiacwhich centers on the hunt for a sociopath who beginning in the late sixties killed at random while taunting San Francisco Bay Area police and newspaper editors with hammy threats and bizarre cryptogramsisnt the same kind of tour de force. But in its roundabout elliptical way it gets at something transcendentally icky about the fetish for serial killers (and serial-killer hunters) that has grown only more common in this era of true-crime blogs and celebrity forensic scientists. Its a movie about the allure of grotesque puzzlesand about living with the bogeyman when the bogeyman in all likelihood no longer lives. SEE ALSO Backstory on the Zodiac Case It should be said that the movie itself feels like an unfinished puzzle. I dont know if vital connecting material was lopped out in the editing room (the thing still runs two and a half hours) or if the screenwriter James Vanderbilt couldnt find the right frame for all the minutiae in the rambling books Zodiac and Zodiac Unmasked by the former editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith (played onscreen by Jake Gyllenhaal). But what begins like your basic police procedural becomes more and more choppy and diffuse. To a point thats intentional Zodiac was never caught and Fincher aims to creep you out with the lack of closure with the absence of a Dirty Harrystyle climax and windup (Dirty Harry being one of the myriad serial-killer thrillers that drew its inspirationif thats what you want to call itfrom the Zodiac case). But there are lapses in storytelling that dont seem like bold artistic choices. Its a little confusing who lives and dies after one Zodiac attack and the escape of a near victim happens entirely off-camera. Fincher it turns out is not a police-procedural-type guy. Hes not a people-type guy. Hes a mood ghoul. A great opening can carry you a long way though and Zodiac has a stunner an attack at night on a couple in a parked car thats among the most brilliantly cruel sequences Ive ever seen. Fincher has already chilled you to the bone with the combination of darkness distant fireworks (its July 4) and Donovans Hurdy Gurdy Man (singing songs of luuuhhh-huhhh-huuuuv). The druggy aura isnt overdone but the dark side of the counterculture is in the music and Finchers pacing in the way a second car pulls up in back and sitsand sits. The face of the figure that emergesout of a sudden bright lightis always on the brink of visibility but never quite And the shots when they come blast right through your head. The second murder set piece is in some ways the greaterand more perverseachievement in daylight in the open (in front of an endless vista) with only the sound of a woodpecker. Well theres one other sound the hooded Zodiac addressing the bound prone couple in almost reassuring tonesthe tones of a reluctant robber not a killer. He really was a sick fuck. The rest of the movie is purposely flatand to be honest I cant remember many scenes distinctly. They go by fast (sometimes too fast). The cinematographer Harris Savides uses a newfangled hi-def video camera and the lighting doesnt seem fussed-over. The excellent actorsamong them Anthony Edwards Elias Koteas Donal Logue and Dermot Mulroneytalk quickly and play it close to the vest in the best police-procedural style. As an investigative reporter who drifts into alcoholism and addiction Robert Downey Jr. blurts his lines and brightens every moment with his choirboy-gone-to-seed ingenuousness. Even when he plays a cynic theres something hopeful about him. The rumpled Mark Ruffalo plays a San Francisco detective who returns every year to the site of a cabdrivers murder and the actor carries a trace of that same boyish hurt. Come to think of it with the addition of Gyllenhaal this is a baby-faced central trio Unlike the obsessed cops and reporters in most noir pictures theyre in a different dimension than the sadist they pursue. John Carroll Lynch is Arthur Leigh Allen who might or might not have been the Zodiac but who is beyond any doubt a scary freak with an inner life the actor can only hint atbroadly. Fincher keeps him on the periphery which is dramatically unsatisfying but ups the eeriness quotient exponentially. As the nominal protagonist Gyllenhaal has a lot of pep but at times seems dazed even shell-shocked; I missed seeing what the real Graysmith claims in interviews that his dogged independent sleuthing came from the same place as his editorial cartoonsas moral outrage at injustice. But then I dont think Fincher can relate much to moral outrage. What occupies him is how to send you home antsy unsure of what youve seen but sure it was worse than you think. He gives you the existential willies. 1 2 3 Next Share this story...

Part sleazy Southern exploitation pic about a wild firecat that would have made Erskine Caldwell blush part blues-infused ""Pygmalion"" story about the tramps reformation at the hands of an older black man Craig Brewers follow-up to his 2005 Sundance winner ""Hustle amp; Flow"" probably will find its most eager audience among college-age guys hot to ogle the young star in some very raw action. The film set in a small Tennessee town that seems populated in equal measure by just-getting-by white and black folk is a strange brew. The first part introduces a massively messed-up character in a boldly lascivious manner The ultra-trashy Rae (Ricci) has a desperate final screw with her Iraq-bound National Guard b.f. (Justin Timberlake) almost immediately thereafter gets it on with beefy black drug dealer Tehronne (David Banner) and then gets so wasted at a dance that shes available for the taking by anyone. After a bloodied unconscious Rae is found by the side of the road next morning and taken in by middle-aged farmer Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson with graying hair and beard) whose wife has just left him the pace lets up a bit. Until that is Rae comes to whereupon her crazed reaction to her new surroundings and caretaker provoke Lazarus to chain her to the radiator. ""I aim to cure you of your wickedness"" announces Lazarus having been informed by Tehronne of Raes ""sickness."" As she herself explains shes got an itch which means she gotta have it and Raes immediate instinct is to offer herself to Lazarus in exchange for her freedom. But thats not part of his mission and no matter what others think of his harboring the local slut in his home Lazarus is determined to try to break Rae of her wildness like a horse. As Raes behavior reduces to simmer however the provocation quotient lowers as well and pic begins to log quite a bit of downtime. Lazarus pulls out his guitar practices some tunes and in a rollicking sequence plays in public for the first time at a bar where a freed Rae dances with abandon. Lazarus finds himself on the receiving end of gentle overtures from a nice lady (the wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson) in a slow-burning relationship and with the help of the local preacher (John Cothran Jr.) Rae may be put on a road toward survival. Its obvious from this film and ""Hustle amp; Flow"" that music means a great deal to Brewer and hardcore blues fans may groove on every minute of the musicianship here. But the dramatic line suffers considerably from the truckful of tunes offered up resulting in a well-executed handsome-looking film that runs perhaps 20 minutes longer than it should given its storyline. Toplined Jackson is very fine as the principled emotionally tender but tough-talking country man who befitting his name takes it upon himself to bring the communitys most scorned woman back to life. Supporting perfs are forceful and/or appealing as required. But it is Ricci who will be remembered when all else about the film has been forgotten. Her large oval face dominating her tiny body which is exceptionally thin around the waist Ricci is clad in scanty cutoffs panties midriff-baring shirts at most and often less. Here she is a feral animal a force of nature a wild thing with a ferocious physicality and a sexuality like Vesuvius in its prime. Her Rae is Eros unplugged unquenchable inexhaustible. Fascinating scary and entirely debauched Rae is the sort of female creature who has been seen onscreen many times before but rarely or perhaps never so bluntly portrayed in a Hollywood studio film.
