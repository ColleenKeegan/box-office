The fact that Rambo contains a record-beating 236 on-screen kills suggests that breathing is actually a complex quadratic equation in comparison. We join our hero in the jungle. Hes quietly tip-toeing through the brush and foraging away. Could it be that Americas foremost patriotic killing machine has decided to hang up his machete and embrace the life of an eco-warrior? Not likely he spends his days gathering poisonous snakes to spice up local tough-man competitions. His work is interrupted by a group of sappy charity workers wanting to be taken down-river into a Burmese war zone so they can distribute aid to villagers who are being massacred by a tear-away military faction. It doesnt take much imagination to guess what happens...Workmanlike in every aspect it thrives ( and partly succeeds) on its dismissal of postmodern detachment. That Rambo opens on real footage of atrocities in Burma is a false start as this film has no connection to reality and nothing to say about the current political climate. This is 90 minutes of violence. No more no less.

The film is a poor sequel to the other Rambos which had some merit. Its ultra-violence is without purpose and will no doubt lead some disturbed individual to emulate its heros rampage.

Judging from the appearance of Sylvester Stallone who co-wrote directed and stars in the hell-with-it-all bloody fourth run of the stomping action franchise John James Rambo at 61 has kept fit via a regular regimen of wrangling poisonous snakes running a longboat and keeping his head bandannas clean. Unfortunately that quiet life is interrupted by a party of howlingly naive Christian missionaries and medics from Colorado who request Rambos navigational services. The do-gooders are headed upriver to assist ethnic Karen refugees in Burma (apparently no ones told Rambo that the countrys called Myanmar now) underdogs who have been fighting a brutal civil war with the ruling military junta for 60 years. The fools have chosen a profoundly dangerous route of course as befits any war pic involving the word ""upriver."" Its a given that Rambo will initially say no followed by grrr. Also a given is the capture of the hapless missionaries the arrival of a search party of colorful mercenaries and Rambos mournful decision to blow all of Burma to hell to rescue the hopeless lot of them -- mercenaries and missionaries alike. Baby-stabbing decapitation gang rape and rivers of blood Rambo is up to its boot tops in numbing violence. The brutality tough enough to take would be intolerable if Stallone didnt toss the movie like a cant-clearing grenade at notions of stay-the-course righteousness (not to mention at the sermonizing of more faith-based agonies staged by Mel Gibson). Rambo teaches that fighting sucks good intentions can be futile and coalitions of the willing are a charade A mans got to do what a mans got to do. Sometimes that means tying on the old bandanna to hack ones way out of the Hollywood jungle so disorienting to aging action stars. B- Want more?

Comments (2) Rambo The fourth and presumably last installment in the Rambo cycle this lumbering kill fest finds the mopey Vietnam veteran (Sylvester Stallone) living quietly in Thailand where a beautiful blond missionary (Julie Benz) persuades him to escort her party of naive do-gooders into war-torn Myanmar. Naturally the pilgrims get themselves kidnapped by the brutal Burmese military and Rambo has to rescue them by blowing away the entire population of Southeast Asia. The orgy of violence as ghastly as in any video game should go a long way toward erasing whatever goodwill Stallone earned with his sentimental Rocky Balboa. R 85 min. By J.R.

His work is interrupted by a group of sappy charity workers wanting to be taken down-river into a Burmese war zone so they can distribute aid to villagers who are being massacred by a tear-away military faction. It doesnt take much imagination to guess what happens...Workmanlike in every aspect it thrives ( and partly succeeds) on its dismissal of postmodern detachment. That Rambo opens on real footage of atrocities in Burma is a false start as this film has no connection to reality and nothing to say about the current political climate. This is 90 minutes of violence. No more no less.

"Rambo Have headband will rescue | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRambo Have headband will rescue Vietnam vet John Rambo must be getting long in the tooth by now. Still if his alter ego Rocky Balboa can get back in the boxing ring as he did in the 2006 movie Rocky Balboa  then John Rambo can surely pick up his bow and arrow and head off to another war zone.By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. Jan. 25 2008Starring Sylvester Stallone Julie Benz Graham McTavish and Paul Schulze. Directed by Sylvester Stallone. 93 minutes. At major theatres. 18A  Vietnam vet John Rambo must be getting long in the tooth by now. Still if his alter ego Rocky Balboa can get back in the boxing ring as he did in the 2006 movie Rocky Balboa then John Rambo can surely pick up his bow and arrow and head off to another war zone.The creator of the Rocky and Rambo franchises Sylvester Stallone looks pretty good in this the fourth Rambo movie called simply Rambo. If his body (and raven locks) look much the same Rambos spiritual depression - the sorrow of a warrior forever trapped in the warriors role - is also unchanged. His shoulders are slumped he looks glum and he says very little. His first words are ""F--- you okay?"" followed shortly by ""F--- the world.""Along come a band of Colorado Christian missionaries knocking on the door of Rambos hut in Thailand where our hero is now making a living capturing live cobras for a tourist sideshow. The missionaries want to rent Rambos boat and go upriver to Burma to help villagers oppressed by the military regime. In case anybody in the audience doesnt know about the nature of that regime Stallone has prefaced his movie with a collage of real clips of government brutality in Burma. If nothing else the villains in this move are well chosen. Article Continued BelowThe missionaries are another matter. We sense trouble the moment their leader a man named Michael Burnett (Paul Schulze) tries to pressure Rambo into letting them use his boat. Rambo was temporarily at least a Buddhist in his third movie but that seems behind him now and all that is left is world-weariness and cynicism. Theres makings here of a serious debate about social activism versus keeping out of trouble but all the audience has to hear is Burnetts high-pitched querulous voice in response to Rambos basso profundo to know whos in the right. If Jesus told his disciples to be as innocent as doves and wise as serpents these Christians have forgotten the serpent part.We know its inevitable that the missionaries are going to go to Burma and that Rambo is going to have to try to rescue them even if it means mowing down the whole Burmese army in the process.""So they send in the devil to do Gods work"" says a hulking Australian mercenary part of the rescue attempt. ""Its ironic isnt it?""Highly ironic. The implications of that irony are not explored in the movie which is just as well. Part of the virtue of Rambo is its simplicity - you might say even the pristine simplicity - of its formula. There are no philosophical discussions. We do not even have to endure any canoodling between Rambo and the fetching young Christian missionary Sarah (Julie Benz). Stallone directs his movie the same way that Rambo and mercenaries conduct the rescue attempt he gets in quick tackles the job complete with pounding drums in the background and a requisite number of splattered bodies in the foreground and then wraps up the days work without a fare thee well.

(AP Photo/Lionsgate Karen Ballard) Photo Karen Ballard Rambo - There will be blood. And rippled muscle. 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Rambo Action. Starring Sylvester Stallone and Julie Benz. Directed by Sylvester Stallone. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) By now Sylvester Stallone seems to have accepted that his two lasting contributions to civilization are Rocky Balboa and John Rambo and his new film ""Rambo"" is a product of that acceptance. Its a straight-ahead action film that makes the first 30 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"" look like a debutante ball. Its 90 minutes of flying dismembered limbs and explosions of blood but give the man credit. Stallone can do action. If you want action and nothing but here it is. For that matter if you want a Rambo movie heres another movie called ""Rambo."" Sure the 1985 film was technically called ""Rambo First Blood Part II"" but who ever called it that? Does this mean Stallone is stuck? No but his public probably is and Stallone knows it. In ""Rambo"" he does his job providing himself with good one-liners pithy aphorisms (""Live for nothing or die for something"") and opportunities for him to kill literally hundreds of people in a matter of minutes. He goes out and gives us a ""Rambo"" movie. Since you know whether or not you want to see a ""Rambo"" movie its worth a minute to consider ""Rocky"" and ""Rambo"" and what they signify. For those who dont like Stallones movies theyre interchangeable two muscle-bound oafs who specialize in violence. But in truth theyre more like mirror images. The ""Rocky"" movies are all about finding victory in defeat. It doesnt matter if he wins or loses. The films are about struggle and consolation about coming to terms with the disappointments and limitations of life and finding satisfaction in the honest exertion of effort. Rambo movies are about the reverse. Theyre about finding defeat in victory. Rambo always wins but it never matters. The world remains horrible - and everything horrible is seen as a reflection of Rambos own inner life. He has the same murderous rage that his enemies have and he knows it. As such hes a man on the cusp between civilization and barbarism but at the same time he gives the lie to civilization itself. He knows that even seemingly mild and innocent people are motivated by brutal selfish impulse. Thats why he isnt friendly. At the start of the movie hes working in the Far East as a snake rustler. He finds cobras and other slithering reptiles for a professional snake handler. (Where does Stallone come up with this stuff?) When a missionary asks for a ride up the river to Burma so that he and his fellow believers can bring aid to the suffering oppressed people Rambo rejects him. He sees him as an egotistical lightweight whose motives arent pure enough. He says ""yes"" only when a female missionary (Julie Benz) repeats the request and he does so not because shes pretty (Rambo is beyond sex) but because shes his own moral superior. Thats the setup. The rest is a bloodbath followed by a rescue drama which amounts to an even bigger bloodbath. There are war scenes here unlike any other. They could be called war scenes with a conscience in that theyre all about blood and as such they attempt to show what warfare is about. Blood doesnt flow. It comes down in buckets and sprays and splashes as heads and arms and severed torsos hurl through the air like projectiles. Its a mess. Needless to say the existential philosophy lesson gets lost in the commotion. The ""Rambo"" movies are wedded to the action formula which means that they have to end in victory and Stallone is too smart to mess with that. Actually he shouldnt mess with that. But just once after the bodies are buried - or better yet left to rot - Id like to see Stallone explicitly pursue and acknowledge his implicit message with these films that its all compromise that its all awful and that life is such a complete waste of time that you really might as well blow 10 on the new ""Rambo"" movie. -- Advisory This violence contains a movie but only intermittently. Mainly its all violence.

Tuesday June 3 2008 1117 AM RAMBO. The third sequel in the First Blood series sends its hero to Burma to rescue kidnapped missionaries. With Sylvester Stallone. Director Stallone. (133) R language extreme violence. At area theaters.Like a lost recording by the Beatles Sylvester Stallones ""Rambo"" arrives in theaters today with its feet planted firmly in the past a reminder of a time when Stallone Chuck Norris and other wooden soldiers of the big screen filled multiplexes with the floor-shaking thunder of trivialized war.Its been 20 years since we last saw the hero of the ""First Blood"" series that scarred Vietnam vet with an addiction to revenge and a supernatural ability to defeat Third World armies and live to fight another day. This time the fantasy is so over-the-top the enemies so comically monstrous and their deaths so gory that you may just throw your head back and roar with laughter. ""Rambo"" is the second film in Stallones Greatest Hits comeback tour following 2006s ""Rocky Balboa"" the sixth film in that boxing series and the first since 1990. To his credit or to the credit of the human growth hormone he espouses the 61-year-old star writer director and producer looks as fit as Jack LaLanne pulling a tugboat across San Francisco Bay. And his unmellowed Rambo has the same signature snarl nasal grunt and steely stoicism of those long-ago triumphs. In this episode Rambos misanthropic world-view clashes with the Good Samaritanism of a group of Colorado missionaries that he and a church-hired band of mercenaries attempt to rescue from military captors in Burma. Rambo now retired in Malaysia where he traps snakes for a freak show and renovates old boats had taken the missionaries to Burma earlier and offended their leader (Paul Schulze) by killing a half-dozen Burmese pirates en route. The contrast between Rambos some-people-need-killing pragmatism and the missionaries every-life-is-sacred credo is the dramatic fill between the frequent battle scenes. However the only question hanging over this show is exactly when the head missionary will begin singing ""Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition."" And what a lot of quality ammo there is machine guns that tear bodies apart and explode skulls like water balloons; arrows that Rambo flings through the eyes of enemies at 100 yards; a trip-wire explosive with the force of a small atomic bomb.

"Rambos back and there will be blood - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsReal EstateLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Rambos back and there will be blood In his fourth film John Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone) is recruited to save a church group being held captive in Burma. (karen ballard/lionsgate) Email|Print| Text size - + By Mark Feeney Globe Staff / January 25 2008 When last seen 20 years ago John Rambo that steroidally buff bandana-wearing killing machine was out-mujahideening the mujahideen in fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Now he makes his living catching snakes in northern Thailand. ""Too many cobras More boas"" his boss yells at him.""Rambo"" has been directed cowritten and stars Sylvester Stallone. A little more than a year ago he came back as Rocky. Now its Rambos turn. He gets around in a rust-bucket motor launch that might be a hand-me-down from ""Apocalypse Now."" Also his bow and arrows are no longer the scariest thing about him He appears to have had an awful lot of bad cosmetic surgery. Its a face only the international box office could love.A Colorado church group asks Rambo if he can take them upriver to Burma to make their annual delivery of medical supplies and Bibles. Sizing them up for the self-righteous annoyances they are (the movie has a rather remarkable anti-clerical streak) Rambo declines. But when the sole female in the group (Julie Benz not bad in a thankless role) asks beast bonds with beauty and Rambo grunts his assent.A good thing too since he has to save them from river pirates. Not that the church folk appreciate this. ""Taking a life is never right"" the groups sanctimonious leader (Paul Schulze) sniffs at Rambo. Clearly he has no idea who hes talking to and rejects Rambos offer of help once they reach their destination.Faith can move mountains. It can even move Rambo. It cannot however move the Burmese army which shoots up the village where the group sets up shop. The surviving members are taken prisoner.The churchs minister (Ken Howard) shows up on Rambos doorstep and asks him to take upriver a group of mercenaries hes hired - sometimes you turn the other cheek and sometimes you just dont - in an effort to rescue his parishioners.Its pretty easy to figure out the rest.""Rambo"" isnt dull. It is however often murkily directed a real shortcoming in an action movie. In the big rescue-the-prisoners sequence its very hard to keep track of who is doing what to whom where. Theres a silly flashback montage in black-and-white (hey theres Richard Crenna) for filmgoers whove missed the previous three Rambo movies. And the violence level keeps ratcheting up to near-sickening effect limb removal decapitation disembowelment. Much of ""Rambo"" could be a recruitment video for abattoir work. The idea of anyone under say 16 seeing this movie is insane.None of this is beyond what youd expect - or fear - from a Rambo movie. What is inexcusable is the moral self-congratulation the movie trades on attaching itself to the plight of the Burmese people. Or has Stallone been holding out on us all these years and John Rambo is secretly a member of Amnesty International?Mark Feeney can be reached at mfeeneyglobe.com.

Young audiences cant possibly be interested in the violent exploits of someone old enough to be collecting Social Security no matter how ripped he is or how much plastic surgery has molded his face into a permanent scowl. And audiences who saw the three previous Rambo movies in the 80s have no doubt moved on to better and smarter action fare. (Bourne anyone?) So who is this movie for besides Stallone himself? Stallone wears one expression throughout the 90-plus-minute orgy of explosions severed limbs and spewing blood. He glares glowers and doesnt say much. But then Rambo never has. The best that can be said about Rambo is that it makes last years Rocky redux look like Oscar material. Renegade veteran John Rambo (Stallone) a former Green Beret has been living in Thailand running a long boat and wrangling poisonous snakes. Nearby on the Thai-Burma border the worlds longest civil war rages. It has only deepened Rambos cynicism so he ignores the bloodshed and spends his free time spearfishing. When a group of human rights workers seeking to bring medical supplies to Burmese villagers asks him to transport them up the river he flatly turns them down. After repeated efforts by the groups only woman Sarah (Julie Benz) Rambo relents. He may have abs of steel but deep down hes an old softie. When the group gets captured Rambo is approached by a church pastor (Ken Howard) who has hired mercenaries to smuggle out the workers. He needs Rambo and his boat. For those who have been lucky enough to miss the Rambo series its important to know he was trained by the U.S. military as a killing machine while in Vietnam. Now decades later hes still in top shape despite the obvious lack of gym equipment in the Thai jungles. As it turns out hes also fired up and ready to unleash his one-man army powers on the brutal military that terrorizes Burmese villagers. There is never a moments doubt that Rambo will save the day so there isnt much need to pay close attention. Plus Stallone the director makes it hard not to glaze over as he assaults the audience with blurring scenes of flying bodies spraying bullets and torture of all kinds. His brawny look and sulky manner havent changed much over the years. There is a blessed dearth of dialogue but much of it is unintentionally hilarious. The mouthiest mercenary a surly Brit is given the best line to snarl at our hero ""You can drop that thousand-yard stare. Ive seen it all before and Im not impressed.""

Why he didnt become a liberal icon is a mystery. Must have been that American flag he wore on his fatigues. ""Rambo"" 4.0 which opens today finds John Rambo behaving more strangely than ever. He lives in Thailand where he pilots a riverboat (possibly bought secondhand from Capt. Willard of ""Apocalypse Now"") and is apparently top man in the lucrative cobra-catching industry. When some human-rightsy types show up to gab about delivering medicine to impoverished minorities being oppressed by warlords in Burma he asks ""Are you bringing in any weapons?"" Of course not he is told. ""Then youre not changing anything"" he says. Later he will add ""F-k the world."" It turns out Rambos hard-won bitterness can be softened by a two-minute Student Council speech (""Maybe you lost your faith in people but you must still have faith in something . . ."") given by a blond do-gooder named Sarah (Julie Benz). At this point Rambo changes his mind and even decides to work for nothing. Soon he and his new pals are floating into darkest Burma. He doesnt even say goodbye to his snakes. Wrong as the current Burmese government is - pending their assassination in the next coup the goons in charge have dubbed the country ""Myanmar"" - Sylvester Stallone who co-wrote and directed gives us no compelling reason why we or Rambo should be involved. This time its impersonal. Rambo is a solo artist. Yet here he joins a squad of mercenaries hired to rescue the human-rights workers who get themselves kidnapped. For a stretch of the movie Rambo is reduced to hanging around in the background while the mercenaries twitter about their toughness. Rambo is no Chatty Cathy yet Stallone has him fairly yammering with exposition about the plight of the minority Karen people and the habits of Burmese pirates. He even pep talks the mercenaries who want to turn back with these words ""This is what we do. Who we are."" Whats with this ""we"" business Coach Rambo? Stick to cobra collecting. Avoid motivational speaking. Rambo needs no one yet here humiliatingly he needs his bacon saved by the mercenaries. He then joins their team for a round of giga-violence rivaled in my experience only by an adolescent game called Smear the Queer (50 rampaging boys turned loose with the sole aim of inflicting pain on one another). Heads are snicked off at long range by automatic weaponry. Bodies are broken explosively into flying cutlets. When being especially nice the characters merely hack off one anothers limbs. An element of exaggeration takes over. The humble Claymore mine - generally considered an effective way to mar the outlook of a dozen or two enemies at a time - is here presented as the kind of mushroom cloud-producing device that will set hammocks swaying in New Zealand. All of this happens at a volume that made my cuffs vibrate in the breeze. Needlessly violent? No ""Rambo"" is needfully violent. Johnny R. is a man constructed of violence. He can no more do without firing arrows into skulls than a lady poet can do without her yoga. The psychological effects of his metier might be worth considering but Stallone isnt interested in anything but the next explosion. Im not saying I want Rambo to start seeing Dr. Friedman on Park and 85th every Tuesday and Thursday but we love Rocky Balboa because hes more than a punching machine. Rambo is no longer a symbol of betrayal in Vietnam or anything else. Hes just a walking Claymore. RAMBO Running time 93 minutes. Rated R (strong graphic bloody violence sexual assaults grisly images profanity).

Slideshow Not a movie but an obscene gory game Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon For the revenge-hungry the sight of weary warrior John Rambo fighting injustice with blood justice will sate the appetite. For the bloodthirsty the prospect of what some call ""the most violent mainstream movie ever filmed"" will quench the parched parts. To them I say Buy the video game. With its first-person-shooter perspective and gun-and-run narrative this ones for the PlayStation crowd. Its not a movie. Its an adrenaline pump and purveyor of raw carnage. This slab of action porn finds its title character in Thailand wrangling cobras (perhaps an inside reference to another Stallone screen character) and grunting by the banks of the river Salween where he apparently lives in a longboat using a crossbow to harpoon fish. Given his soiled headband ratty locks and broken muscle-bulging body he resembles a mothballed Conan the Barbarian. American missionaries want him reactivated. A church group approaches Rambo to guide them upriver to Myanmar (called Burma in the film) to aid rebels of the military government. He resists their entreaties. Stallone who wrote and directed as well as stars depicts the Myanmar military much as he did the Soviets in Rambo III demonic figures who torture by sprinkling land mines in rice paddies and firing on prisoners who run to their explosive deaths. When pretty missionary Sarah (Julie Benz) begs Rambo yet again he takes the men and women of God upriver. When you hear one missionary sermonize that ""Taking a life is morally indefensible"" in Act 1 you know that he will be toting a gun by Act 3. When Rambo drops them off in the war zone like a parent leaving the kids for school you know hell be back. Within days another churchman (whats Ken Howard doing here?) hires Rambo to ferry mercenaries to liberate the now-imprisoned missionaries. To this motley crew who have no morals Rambo grunts ""Live for nothin or die for sumpin."" Do Americans really want Sylvester Stallone or his alter ego as a moral compass? This after all is the director/star of the Afghanistan-themed Rambo III where his character assisted the mujaheddin and said if memory serves ""Im proud to be part of your jihad."" Of course Stallone adherents wont flock to Rambo for its political views. And so to answer the critical question Is this indeed the Goriest. Movie. Ever? Lets call it a tie with The Passion of the Christ. And lets call it a day for this franchise. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at crickeyphillynews.com or 215-854-5402.

"Rambo reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Rambo reviewed. Rambo reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 24 2008 611 PM Rambo He just wants to hand-forge iron and be left alone but then a blond missionary shows up. By Dana Stevens Sylvester Stallone in Rambo I know were supposed to be all nostalgic about the 80s these days. Ronald Reagan has become a ""transformative"" and ""dynamic"" figure to be slavishly copied by Republicans and nebulously praised by Democrats. John Rambo Sylvester Stallones iconic Vietnam-vet action hero has a similarly slippery political valence. As the casualty of an unjust American war who was ignored by an uncaring government and goaded by brutal cops in the original film First Blood hes vaguely a hero of the anti-war left. In the sequels as an unequaled kicker of Communist ass hes firmly on (and in) the right. Now that hes been resurrected in a fourth film simply called Rambo Stallones protean warrior has a whole new overseas conflict to symbolize. Rambo is nothing if not flexible; hes capable both of ruing the harm that man inflicts on his fellow man and inflicting it by the monster truckload. When we first see him again Rambo (Stallone still granite-faced and massively muscled at 61) is living in semi-seclusion in the Thai jungle piloting a riverboat and capturing live cobras to sell to snake wranglers (hey it beats telemarketing). Decades of suffering have tempered him like iron (which as we learn in the opening scenes he also knows how to forge by hand). Rambo is approached by a group of American missionaries who want to be taken to Myanmar (formerly Burma) to deliver aid to the oppressed Karen tribespeople (a Christian minority in the country). At first he flatly refuses sneering at the groups desire to do good ""Nothing ever changes"" he tells the groups blonde Sarah (Julie Benz). But something about Sarah--her blondness? Her goodness? Her complete lack of character traits other than goodness or blondness?--compels him to ferry the group upriver against his best instincts. Advertisement After a brief and bloody encounter with a Burmese pirate ship Rambo leaves the missionaries at their destination and returns to his nihilistic snake-trapping existence. But Burmese soldiers soon storm the Karen village slaughtering all the natives and taking the missionaries prisoner. Their pastor (Ken Howard) flies in to beg Rambo to lead a team of mercenaries to rescue the group and soon Rambos headed back upriver with a sketchy crew of international soldiers of fortune. When they finally storm the hideout where the army is holding the captives in bamboo cages--well Katy bar the door. Not that barring the door will do much good when Rambo is on the other side with a crossbow. Rambo combines an unapologetic return to the grand action-movie tradition of blowing stuff up (one explosion is so big it leaves behind its own miniature mushroom cloud) with a Saw-era interest in close-ups of human viscera. The problem is that the moral meaning of the gore keeps changing. The airborne organs of a helpless Karen villager are supposed to make us scream ""Rambo right this injustice"" while the splattered guts of a Burmese army officer are meant to evoke a reaction along the lines of ""Aw yeah."" But no matter how realistically rendered and lovingly framed in slow-mo guts are just guts and they tend to engender the same reaction an ethically neutral ""ew."" If you like seeing people blown in half beheaded and impaled have a ball (but dont sit next to me on the subway home please). If you dont the horror of these images is hardly going to leave you pondering the plight of the Karen in Myanmar. Stallone has said that he hopes the film will raise awareness of the civil war there but his use of actual news footage of Burmese atrocities as the film opens seems like a pious canard (and an invasion of privacy of the real people whose deaths we witness). Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Rambo franchise is a fantasy of total war whose very power derives from its nonspecificity. The only consistent message from film to film is ""Rambo kills meanies with extreme prejudice""; whether those meanies are cops (First Blood) Viet Cong holdouts (Rambo First Blood Part II) or Soviet troops in Afghanistan (Rambo III) seems like a matter of pure historical chance.  I dont doubt that Sylvester Stallone feels for the people of Burma. Still setting his film there is a convenient way of allowing us the satisfaction of a righteous victory without finding a way for John Rambo to intervene in Iraq where (at least for American audiences) the moral math is far harder to do. Saving blond missionaries and innocent Christian villagers from oily swaggering rapists is a mission anyone can get behind. Figuring out how to bring peace in the Middle East through the application of overwhelming force? That may be a job for Rambo V Last Blood (No Seriously). Correction Jan. 25 2008 The article originally misstated the title of the second Rambo film Rambo First Blood Part II. ( Return to the corrected sentence.)

Although Stallone plays it completely straight the mere idea of the aging action star strapping on the bandana again is risible enough to let the movie play like a comedy too albeit one with an unusually high body count. The Sylvester Stallone nostalgia tour that began with another ""Rocky"" continues with this fourth ""Rambo."" Although Stallone plays it completely straight the mere idea of the aging action star strapping on the bandana again is risible enough to let the movie play like a comedy too albeit one with an unusually high body count. So while much of the audience will show up to admire what armored-piercing weapons do to human flesh others can giggle at the notion of Rambos return in a movie that doesnt risk gumming up its carnage with much of a plot. Based on ""Rockys"" scorecard box office should be initially robust which will be welcome if only to compensate the movies 11 executive producers -- evidence of the business contortions required to engineer Rambos comeback with Stallone as co-writer and director as well as reprising his starring role. In a sense the timing is strangely appropriate inasmuch as ""Rambo"" wound up being a kind of referendum on Vietnam advancing the theory that the war was winnable if only wed let Rambo do his job leaving him to pay (and pay and pay) for all his countrymens sins back home. Given the current debate over Iraq this latest bloodbath perhaps wisely steers clear of those landmines though they remain unavoidable subtext to anybody who knows the characters history. Although Rambo made his debut in 1982 he was last seen 20 years ago fighting alongside the Afghan Mujahadeen against the Soviet incursion -- ""Charlie Wilsons War"" if you will with more explosions and less dialogue. The new film -- which goes without a ""IV"" anywhere -- finds the ex-Green Beret killing machine living in Thailand and paying the rent by capturing snakes looking leathery and sounding gravelly on those occasions where he deigns to speak with something more than a weary withering stare. Recruited to ferry a church group of idealistic doctors on a humanitarian mission to Burma he balks at first citing the dangerous civil war there. Indeed the Burmese in the movie largely break into two barely human categories cannon fodder; and sadistic butchers who graphically slaughter entire villages of men women and children the better to unleash the righteous wrath of you-know-who. Among the missionaries is Sarah (Julie Benz of Showtimes ""Dexter"") who in a brief exchange melts Rambos heart enough to prompt him to guide them upriver and into No Mans Land. When Sarah and her companions are taken prisoner he agrees to return with a small mercenary force setting up a battle sequence against impossible odds. It spoils nothing to say that while the opposing army is said to number 100 roughly 10 times that many seem to die often losing limbs in showers of gore. Despite being set in the jungle and lensed in Thailand the movie has an oddly washed-out look and some sequences look like they could have been shot in Griffith Park. Multiple scenes moreover are staged during driving rainstorms which like the modest running time (roughly 80 minutes before the credit scroll begins) perhaps helps obscure a limited budget. Then again the world of Rambo is equally dreary a place where a do-gooder doctor (Paul Schulze) who says ""Taking a life is never right"" is clearly due a rude awakening. As for Rambo he not only knows killing is justified but after a gauzy flashback grudgingly accepts that its the only thing he really does well. Stallone (who looks fit but mostly keeps his shirt on) has no intention of bogging the action down but its still a notably cheerless exercise without knowing winks or stabs (pardon the expression) at humor. It is in all respects rather a completely workmanlike effort providing just enough background on the Burmese thugs to pave the way for their comeuppance. Watching Rambo pilot his boat and ragtag crew down the river in fact brought to mind a line from the atmospherically similar ""Apocalypse Now"" albeit slightly altered for the occasion He wanted a movie and for our sins they gave him one.

Its one John Rambo - and Sylvester Stallone - take to heart in Rambo. A killing machine can only be happy trapping serpents and piloting boats for so long before he has to go out and you know kill again. ""This is who we are"" Rambo grunts before taking down the Myanmar army. Right. But lets not get ahead of ourselves. Stallone has taken the ultimate warrior out of mothballs - he directs with a flair for action sequences and co-wrote the script as well - after an 18-year absence plopped him in the middle of a civil war and had him kill lots of people in extraordinarily violent ways. Extreme prejudice is no joke in this film. Along the way we get murky moral messages about . . . what? Its difficult to say. Be true to yourself? Even if that means gutting people blowing their heads off nailing them not just in the back with an arrow but putting an arrow through the back of the head till it comes out the chin? One might suppose that killing in such obscene ways negates whatever justification there is for the violence blurring the line between good and evil right and wrong. Cmon. This is Rambo were talking about. ""Live for nothing. But die for something."" Whatever. Just go whack somebody dude. When the story begins Rambo is indeed capturing and selling serpents and piloting people upriver along the Thai border with Myanmar (formerly Burma). Actually scratch that - the story really begins with violent news footage of the Karen civil war in Myanmar. Its Stallones little stab at social relevance before blasting it to smithereens. We see gory violence of the army killing people in truly ugly ways such as putting mines in flooded fields and betting on who will be blown up as people run through. Then they mow down the survivors with guns. Meanwhile a church group finds Rambo; its members want him to take them upriver. He grunts and groans (in this part of the film he sounds like a grumpy John Goodman) and turns them down. But Sarah (Julie Benz) is persistent and pretty so he relents. So they all head off get where theyre going distribute Bibles and offer medical care and come back home to live happily ever after. Just kidding. Things go horribly of course. Soon Rambo is back with a band of mercenaries (read cannon fodder) to save the missionaries. Only now his voice sounds like Rocky after he has pulled himself up by the bootstraps (again). Hes fired up hes angry hes a one-man army - the usual. You have to give Stallone credit where its due as a director he knows how to stage exciting action sequences. Theyre incredibly elaborate and the chaos is convincing but theyre so gratuitously violent as to be pornographic. And yet when a really bad guy is getting ready to do another really bad thing and you see Rambo slowly rise up behind him you cheer him on despite yourself. Its confusing. Rambo makes you root for the wrong things. Or maybe it doesnt. Everyone pulls for the good guy. And the bad guys are so bad here their crimes so disgusting theres nothing redeeming about them. You dont exactly mourn their deaths. But you do squirm at the manner in which theyre killed. Do the ends justify the means? Do they ever? Like everything else in the film its overkill.
